This should clear up any questions you might have about the game, and if you still don't like it afterwards, then I guess it isn't for you.\n\n---\n\nCoin Crypt is a procedurally-generated roguelike adventure game. What makes this game unique is its deckbuilding mechanics and deep, strategic gameplay. You play as a lootmancer, one of 20 characters who hunt for treasure in the mysterious "Coin Crypts". The coins found within treasure chests are used for both battling and bartering, but once they're used they're gone forever. With 201 different coins to find and use, the game offers a rich variety of play.\n\nCoin Crypt separates itself from other games in its genre through a combination of strategy and pressure. The combat system runs on an active time battle format rather than a strict turn-based system. Each coin has its own cast time, and if you take too long to decide your play, your opponent will get the better of you. There's always the looming danger of running out of coins, which immediately ends your run. Because of this, you must keep your deck lean and efficient, but also mindful of the coins you spend as they'll disappear once used. To balance this, you can donate unneeded coins to Deities, the Loot Gods, who offer specific coins that suit different styles of play such as stalling, pure offense, defensive, and more.\n\nOther than the wide variety of coins, there's also a good amount of different enemies who challenge you with specific playstyles. Some will steal your coins, poison you, force you to drop your coins, and more. Each floor has an optional miniboss that award you with items that give positive modifiers to your character. Once you've beaten 9 levels, you'll have to fight a random boss to win your run. As with most roguelikes, Coin Crypt has permadeath. Upon ending a run, you can use the money you accumulated to unlock different character classes with different modifiers that can change the way you play. Every class has to be played in their own unique way, and there’s no one method that will work for any class.\n\nThis game offers great replayability, a surprising amount of depth, and good fun if you're looking for a more strategic roguelike/RPG. Be warned; it is a difficult game with a moderate learning curve. One of its biggest issues is that new players will have a hard time learning the mechanics. There is no tutorial, and the game can feel very confusing at first. It will take a lot of subsequent playthroughs to slowly understand the strategies and skills needed. Some players may get turned off by the game's almost childish art. Personally, I feel like it suits the game, giving it an almost boardgame-like aesthetic, which suits its gameplay. Some aspects may feel unbalanced, such as quick enemies or unfair coins, and there are still some bugs that have ruined some user's savefiles. Playing the game with a gamepad may feel awkward, but it plays smoothly with keyboard and mouse. Some classes are more difficult to play than others, although that's typical for most roguelikes. However, the developer is still in touch with the community and has steadily been working out the game's kinks. All in all, Coin Crypt is definitely worth the $10.00 purchase.\n\nTL; DR: One of the most underrated roguelikes on Steam. Must-get if you're a fan of collectible card games and roguelikes/RPGs.","July 23, 2015","true","67.5"," 82 of 86 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","82","86","0","8"

Each coin is assigned a traditional currency value but also doubles as a separate item in your inventory used to attack, defend or heal, as well as to cause or cure status effects.  Dozens of unique coin types exist within the game.\n\nDungeon design is basic and not much makes one room or floor stand out from another, aside from the occasional environment change.  You’ll find most of what you’d expect while exploring:  shopkeepers who will trade upgrades for coins; secret rooms; random elements like coin hungry cat pillars (not to be confused with caterpillars); enemies ranging from skeletons to bandits to grannies; and chests which contain coins, keys or upgrades.  Enemies will chase you if you venture too close and, once you come into contact, you’ll be taken to another screen to duel it out.\n\nBattle is where Coin Crypt genuinely tries to be original and takes place in first-person with your palm stretched out before you, with a random selection of coins in it.  You can either use one of the coins in your hand or redraw for new ones, but the clock is ticking and both options have a cast time.  Meanwhile you can see how close the enemy is to completing his action, what coin he’s using and how many coins he has left.  If you survive until he runs out of coins you win and, if you destroy him before he runs out, you’ll also get his unused coins as loot.\n\nManaging what coins you have on hand is an important balance that means you can’t snatch up everything for sale in every shop you find because, if you run out of coins during battle, you will die the same as if you’d been killed.  Upon death, you can spend the total currency value of coins you found to unlock additional characters, each with a unique strength and weakness.\n\nCoin Crypt is easy to pick up and put down, and almost seems more suited for handheld devices and touch controls than PC; however, it plays perfectly fine with mouse and keyboard and the developers have set a very reasonable five dollar asking price, so make your own call here.","December 3, 2013","true","3.8"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","33","35","0","2"

Coin Crypt is roguelike top-down RPG w/ real-time card-based combat, and an on-map encounter system for enemies (touching an enemy in the "overworld" triggers combat). The way the card game system is done is far different from anything else I've ever come across. I suppose it would make the most sense to start by explaining how the real-time part works.\n\nWhen you play a card, your character removes it from your hand, and starts to cast it, during which time you cannot do anything else. Casting basically presents as a windup timer showing how long that particular played card needs until it is put into effect. When it comes down to it, casting is what really ties the combat together, and makes the real-time part viable. Cards cast quick enough to keep the feeling of real-time –combat feels like a continuous string of actions–, but also slow enough so you have time to think during an opponent's cast –effectively preventing it from coming down to a battle of luck and who clicks quickest. The best comparison I can give of how it feels would be to say when casting is at it's very worst the combat's flow slows the same way it might when reloading your gun in an FPS, and when casting is normal I'd say combat flow is more akin to chess utilizing a stop clock –you feel pressure to be quick, but there's enough time to be deliberate, and overall strategy/planning definitely feels like the main focus and factor in winning.\n\nHowever, casting is far from being the only uncommon part of the card system. That said, every unique mechanic seems to be carefully designed with each of the others in mind, chief of which are the roles cards themselves play. Cards are essentially everything. Not only are cards the combat medium, but cards are the loot, cards are the passive effect carriers, some cards are one-use skeleton keys, cards remaining in your deck is a secondary health bar, and –most importantly– all cards are currency. In line with this duel nature, used cards are not given back after battle (they are dropped when you play them), forcing you to choose a little more literally, and much more carefully, how you spend them. Using cards to buy useful items and influence the island gods needs to be balanced with keeping a large enough and carefully built enough deck so you don't run out of cards. On top of this, you are forced to take only a few out of a small group of coins chest ghosts offer when you're looting a chest, so it can often be a tough choice deciding how many of the weak/low-value cards of the type you're low on (for example Heal 2 worth $5) you should take versus how many of the average/mid-value coin (like Attack 4).\n\nBuilding around that duality, a lot of the other mechanics are designed in order to make deliberate, personalized deck construction and management the backbone of the game. This is also why the card game mechanics have to be so unorthodox compared to most card games. Your hand size is only 3 cards (by default), your health is only 10 (by default), and when you play a card you also draw a fresh hand. Additionally, all drawn hands will organize any duplicate cards into stacks (stacks if played will cast all the cards in that stack at once as a single cast). Having a small hand and possible stacks means trying to prevent cards that don't help your build from accumulating in your deck and not taking care not to be too prone to finding yourself choosing between using two Attack 4 cards (or w/e) on a 2/10 health monster, or letting their cast finish while you redraw and taking 4 damage.\n\nBeyond that, it forces you to create a deliberate style of deck-build & corresponding combat style by making "use the most overpowered coins you can find" type strategy almost useless. Using lots of Steal an enemy card type cards depletes their deck to win, and so physical damage is a waste to have in your deck (most of the time), and a wasted turn could easily mean losing 40% of your health. Poison damage builds rely on overwhelming the opponent more than they can heal while trying to stay guarded, so passive cards –which usually also have a draws often effect– would (normally) get in the way of that. The thing is, there are ways to combine these kinds of cards into a useful deck, but they don't play well together if you just throw them together. Having a lot of damage cards and a few Steal cards can be useful for shield card focused enemies because you can deplete their shields quicker by just taking them (a lot of the time) than letting them keep playing them as you attack over and over, and you can augment this balance to withstand other types of enemies by having most of your deck comprised of shields in case of a bad draw, as shield health and shield time-remaining carry over between battles, so it's not nearly as much of a risk if you don't get the card type you needed. Decks have a lot of depth, esp. depending on your play style, yet coins themselves are often very straightforward.\n\nThere are 201 unique cards in the game so far, and there are tons of items, passive-power cards, blessings, and other things that all modify your stats or mechanics, often in classic RPG fashion. Using items or modifiers in tandem with particular deck builds, strategy complexity can potentially be increased to much, much further depths depending on the chosen play style. Ex. the Joker Token card with the coin pouch. When played, anything that damages the user now heals them, and anything that heals the user now damages them. Two of the status will reverse healing and damage back to normal. A coin pouch lets you store a coin from your current hand for use at any point/battle in place of one of the coins you drew. Using the saved coin also draws a new hand, and clears the quickslot. The Joker Token is one of the best coins to put in it. It can save the player from the brink of death and allow them to survive very powerful attacks, such as the Explosion Chip (Attack 20) used by the "Grandma" enemy. Furthermore, donations to gods lets up two of them bless chests and add several of their card class to your options to pick from, allowing you to more easily tune your deck to a particular play style. The more you donate, the more likely to be rarer cards of that god's type.\n\nIn addition to all of those modifiers, every one of the characters (except for the starter) have more major, unique modifiers of their own, making the game play differently for each character. For example when playing as Demon: whenever the enemy plays a card, one cursed card (that does damage to your player if cast) is added to their deck, but demon also makes all card currency values negative (so cursed coins become positive currency). Basically Demon doesn’t have to buy items or get blessings using the useful cards in his deck, and constantly makes good amounts of money from battle spoils –but the more money you save up the more chance of drawing a hand polluted with harmful cards, and you need to choose between ending battles quickly to take more of the enemy’s original cards (you [default] take 100% of their unplayed cards), or stalling to grind for cash.\n\nOther characters have more simplistic modifiers, like Monkey: he casts more slowly than other characters, but redraws his hand at quadruple speed and always casts all of the cards in his hand. So, In order to do well as Monkey, the player must learn the effects of all the coins they carry, and be a little more frugal to make up for occasional unnecessary card casting caused by his unique traits.\n\nAll of this makes for a tight combat system with tons and tons of styles of play, and giving it an immense amount of replay value, all while remaining very intuitive and fast paced. 11/10 would build a deck again –and again –and again.","February 24","true","11.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","1"

It's a game where you have to start all over again if you die. But Coin Crypt has an original concept for its battles; the loot you find, coins in this case, is also used to battle your foes.\n\nCoins can have different properties, like healing for 5 or 10 points, or doing 10 points of damage while taking 5 of your hitpoints. A fun concept that keeps things fresh. If you run out of coins it's game over. You have to be careful which coins you want to use and which ones you want to save as loot.\n\nOf course, all loot is randomized and there are several floors to go through. It's not a big game, I guess one can complete the game in roughly 30 minutes, if you're lucky enough. If you're not lucky enough, you'll at least earn experience points that can be used to unlock new classes that might you help during future playthroughs.\n\nThe graphics are simple and all enemies are basically just textured rectangles, but it's cute to look at. The sounds didn't make much of an impression on me, but I guess it fits the game as far as style is concerned.\n\nRecommended for it's original take on the genre.

I am just having a hard time getting to enjoy it. I've unlocked five or six classes and it is fun trying them out and their different playstyles, and have gotten as far as level 3-3 with the princess where a grandma killed me rather fast :P. The concept of the game itself -- collecting coins and using them to do battle -- is fine, but the implementation just seems off.\n\nThe biggest issue for me is that the flow or pacing of the game feels like it is all over the place:\n\n1. Walking around is too slow for my tastes. I know this is upgradeable, but it's simply not fun to be walking as slow as you do. The pace after one upgrade is just about perfect for a standard walking speed, or a tad slower than that.\n\n2. Looting coins from enemies/chests and discovering new coins was fun for a short while, but it just seemed too hectic for me to constantly have to keep track of what coins I had at the moment, and it's easy to run out of any particular coin. I am aware this adds an element of "strategy" to the game, and I'm not opposed to strategy in any sense -- I love strategy games, as well as RPGs, and even some computer trading card games (which Coin Crypt's coin system very vaguely resembles). To me, the coin and loot system started feeling like a chore very fast.\n\nThe "cursed chest" system also seemed good in theory, limiting players but giving them choices and what coins to pick, but looting chests quickly felt like a chore as well. The "Choose for me" feature somewhat helped this, but didn't entirely alleviate the pain, and I don't enjoy the game making too many decisions for me :P. Perhaps chests should hold more coins at a time, but have less chests throughout the corridors to compensate. I believe that this would make looting chests more rewarding and feel less like a chore.\n\nAs with the coin system itself, I would enjoy having atleast some basic attack to count on in the heat of battle - it can be relatively weak and slow, with coins still being used the majority of turns, but all too often I'm out of attack coins or it takes 2-3 turns to draw any in my hand for combat. All too often, combat felt more like simple luck based on what coins I drew and the size of the stacks, rather than a system where I had some sense of control and that flowed well.\n\n3. Victory when enemies run out of coins is good and all, but receiving no reward on victory just makes the battle seem like a waste of time -- even a random 3 hit/heal/shield coin would be better than nothing.\n\n4. There's already discussion about and players wanting more RPG and persistent elements to the game, and I would have to strongly agree that these would help make playing Coin Crypt much more enjoyable and rewarding. The devs have posted that they don't want to dilute the challenge of the game, which I understand -- but the game as it is with zero progress (excluding class unlocks) carrying over between deaths seems more like a "hardcore" mode than the standard mode of the game should feel. Perhaps I am bias after playing through an excellent neo-roguelike and a game that is already completed, Rogue Legacy, which balances between progression and perma-death (you could call it serial-death) very nicely.\n\nIn summary,\n\nPros\nPermadeath action\nClass unlocks\nUnique coin system\n\nCons\nBase walking is too slow\nLack of satisfying progression between games\nBattles seem to rely too much on luck\nCoin system in general seems chaotic and not fun\n\nPerhaps this game simply wasn't my "cup of tea" so to speak, but the elements of the game in theory seemed to be enjoyable for me, just not the implementation. I wouldn't want to turn this game into something it isn't, as it already has it's fair share of fans who have enjoyed the game and played it far more than I. But implementing these features and suggestions would hopefully turn the game into something that I would personally more enjoy, and that I believe other players would enjoy as well. Good luck devs, and thanks for reading! I'd like to keep up to date on the development of this game and may try it again after any big updates.\n\nTake care,\n\n- johnmyster","December 31, 2013","false","2.7"," 37 of 64 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","37","64","2","0"

This creates a mechanic that I've never seen before, being a loot hoarder it is hard on me to part with my coins to be able to survive through the attacks and proceed through the dungeon!\n\nIt also has unlockable characters with different set of bonuses that affect gameplay in different ways.\n\nOnly real issue I have with it is that it's an obvious tablet/mobile port to PC, it's abundantly clear in the controls and it's a bit painful at times.\nWell worth the reasonable price :)","February 13, 2014","true","2.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

It's very fun and the graphics are so cute.\nSo basically you're a "lootmancer" and you use coins which can attack/heal/and many others to use on enemies. As you start off the coins are pretty simple "Attack 4" "Heal 4" etc. but they end up getting advantages and disadvantes such as "Attack 7 but Attack 2 on yourself".\n\nTalking about advantages and disadvantages there are many characters to get/unlock which, as I said have advantages and disadvantes which really evens them out. Enemies are all different too, using certain coins having certain HP and etc.  In this game nothing is perfect and is more powerful than others.\n\nThe pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- Really addictive\n- Super unique\n- Cute graphics\n- Tons of secrets\n- Lots of things to unlock\n- Developer updates often, which is rad\n- Randomly genertaed maps, meaning different gameplay each time\n\nCons:\n- I have to admit that $10 is quite expensive for this game\n- Even though there are different generated maps it kinda feels repeatitive, (it's hard to explain it.)\n- In my opinon I can't play this game for a few hours straight, I can probably play a few games then quit as it gets boring if you keep playing a whole day. (but the next day it's fun again lmao)\n\nIdeas for the game:\nI only have one and that's to add online multiplayer! I know this is pretty big but imagine how cool it'd be!

Visually it's adorable, and mechanically its comprehensive without being simplistic. The runs are fast, never lasting more than a half hour or so until you're much better at the game, and the difficulty curve is fair and rewarding to climb. They tend to introduce more complex mechanics to raise the difficulty instead of just increasing numbers. The diversity of characters along with the number of different coins and items that you can buy mean that no run ever really feels the same.\n\nMy one complaint would be ther it does ♥♥♥♥-all to teach the player what is what. None of the icons or mechanics or anything are even kind of explain in a tutorial or tips system or anything. It just kind of assumes you'll figure it out or die. And to be fair, its not hard at all to figure it out.

Music's starting to get repetitive, and i'm sure in a few more hours, it'll get unbearable.\nGameplay is this game's saving grace. Pretty sure I haven't seen a tutorial, but it's pretty straightforward. It has turn-based card-style gameplay, but with a timer. The timer isn't there to pressure you into taking your turn, it's there because every coin played takes a certain amount of time to be "cast". Add in the mix of rather unique perma-buff/debuffs in the form of classes and unique coin effects -- it makes for a really different playthrough each time in terms of speed, strategy, and overall "game feel"... That is, if you choose so.\n\nIf you're familiar with rouge-likes and turn-based games, you'll probably enjoy what Coin Crypt has to offer -- A comfortable pace of progression with a battle system that'll keep you on your toes, even when you're not fighting.\n\nP.S. The game could use a little bit of clarification when it comes to effects. i.e. "Is the debuff happening to me or the enemy?" It might ruin a short run or two, but if you use context, i'm sure you'll be able to figure it out.","August 24, 2015","true","40.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Losing cards from your deck on cast was very frustrating - I decked out a lot when first playing. However, once I got used to the gameplay and unlocked a few classes, the game grew very fun. I especially enjoyed Executive and Demon. Excutive is a bit like milling in Magic the Gathering - you just steal their coins over and over until they have no library of coins and die. Demon is hilarious - you're basically inserting curse cards like in Dominion into their deck until it drowns them. It's utterly satisfying to kill a big stupid enemy just by watching them kill themselves with those self damage coins.\n\nThe graphics etc are nothing special, but that isn't the point of a game like this.

The game starts off kind of confusing as there is really no tutorial at all. You may die a lot, or may be a god at the game already, but as you keep playing, you gain experience on how the coins interact and stuff.  Coin conservation and partioning becomes more important and quick use of coins helps you win battles as the timer keeps ticking even if you dont pick.  Also as you play, more and more coins and enemies are "unlocked" and more and more playable characters are unlocked as well. Since this game is roguelike, each playthrough is different to a degree with random generation but predictable levels.

Graphics and music are fine, there's no real story. You move room-to-room in a dungeon, collect coins (via chests and battles), spend coins (as attacks in battle, for powerups or more coins), and battle using the coin attacks. Floors are time-limited: if you spend too much time exploring, you'll start to drop coins until you leave.\n\nThe god-tribute system isn't explained so I had to search the forums to have an idea what the point was. You can donate coins to gods and in return you'll randomly find bonus coins in chests and debuffed enemies in future levels. If you neglect gods, they'll power up enemies and potentially fight you at the end.\n\nThere's a good amount of luck involved in this game (as is inherent in all card games) but there are some things that influence what is drawn. If you don't get the right coins in chests or draw the right coins in battle, you'll lose through no fault of your own. All you can do is try to maximize your chances and hope you get useful coins from chests.\n\nWorth a try if you think you'd like the game mechanics and are fine with losing and replaying it until you get a good run of luck to get to the end.","August 9, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't remember buying it, so I must have gotten it as a Humble Bundle. I played it thinking it would not be any good, but it really surprised me. There are choices all over, from the character you play, where you go and especially what coins to pick up. The coins are like a big collectible card game, essentially, and you will unlock a bunch as you play. Strategy is key, but there is also randomness and twitchiness at play.\n\nThe developer also made a lot of changes as it goes, adding a lot of coins and content to the base game. It's not even sold as an early release game, so they obviously care about it instead of moving on to the next project.\n\nThe graphics are OK. It could use some work in that department, I guess. The music, however, is awesome. It changes with different environments and is enjoyable.\n\nI've beaten it with the demon character (easiest, I think, once you figure out the tricks involved) and two or three others.

The game has a “cartoonish” quality to the character/environment design, which really appeals to those of us that have nostalgia for games past.  This also means that little ones can enjoy and watch the game too.\n\nDid I make time to complete it?\n\nYes and  I imagine that I will find myself playing this game numerous times throughout its development.\n\nRedlight or Greenlight?\n\nThis game is currently at a greenlight.\n\n$4.99 is a steal for a game with this kind of content.  My “bad” comments above boil down to nothing more than recommendations.  While a lot of Coin Crypt’s general gameplay elements borrow moderately from a number of other games, the strategy present in this title makes it stand out of its own merit.

This game was made for me down to a science.\n\nThere are a ton of systems going on in this gem of a Rogue-like (A word I am using to skip over the obvious about the level generation/enemy layouts/item drops/yada yada).\n\n`Real time pillar crawling/evasive maneuvers to avoid combat sequences and a very effective fog of war that makes crawling a tenative and fun as hell experience\n\n`Combat sequences that have you use randomly drawn coins to the best of your abilities.  Each selection has serious ramifications for the rest of your playthrough (for soooo many reasons)  You will need to familiarize yourself with the coins you carry, because the enemies aren't going to stand around watching you decide what your best move is all night long.  Moving fast is the name of the game... right?\n\n`The coins used in combat also serve as your currency on passive-boost items, healing station fodder, ect.\n\n`For those who are familiar with deck building games, the coins in your inventory can be discarded and/or traded to Gods for coins of lesser value (or none, for the sake of removing dead weight)\n\n`Let's call it stressful fun, trying to not spend enough so that you can feel safe moving down to harder depths, whilst being tempted by shopkeepers with shiny treasures, and shortly afterwards feeling remorse when you don't have any coins for combat purposes.  Or perhaps just the wrong coins.\n\n`Don't leave yourself without any attack coins, or you're ♥♥♥♥ed.  Don't leave yourself without any heal coins or you're ♥♥♥♥ed.  Don't dilude your inventory with too many conflicting ideas amongst your coins, or you're ♥♥♥♥ed.\n\n`You're ♥♥♥♥ed.\n\n`Coins you carry through to the end of the game (Be it your trumph or demise) are used to spend on unlocking additional classees with different play styles.  Characters have their own unique benefits and drawbacks.\n\n\nThere's a lot more to be said, but what I would like to put out there is this:\n\nThis game is seriously impressive and I ♥♥♥♥ing love it","March 6, 2014","true","4.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You use coins to do everything in the game- attack, defend, buy things, etc.  A lot of different characters to play as well- all of which have pros and cons.  This isn't just a mindless "kill everything" roguelike either. You lose if you run out of health or run out of coins! So you must decide if you are going to save the coins, or buy an item with the hopes it wont mess you up later.\n\nUpdate (August 18)- game is out of early access and game maker is still providing great content updates to the game!

I don't remember buying it, so I must have gotten it as a Humble Bundle. I played it thinking it would not be any good, but it really surprised me. There are choices all over, from the character you play, where you go and especially what coins to pick up. The coins are like a big collectible card game, essentially, and you will unlock a bunch as you play. Strategy is key, but there is also randomness and twitchiness at play.\n\nThe developer also made a lot of changes as it goes, adding a lot of coins and content to the base game. It's not even sold as an early release game, so they obviously care about it instead of moving on to the next project.\n\nThe graphics are OK. It could use some work in that department, I guess. The music, however, is awesome. It changes with different environments and is enjoyable.\n\nI've beaten it with the demon character (easiest, I think, once you figure out the tricks involved) and two or three others. Different characters need different strategies. There's even a monkey!\n\nIpicked up the DLC for it finally during the winter sale, so you know it's a good game. Total surprise, but there you are.","December 5, 2015","true","61.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Now, I really only ever play it when I am bored, like games such as Curse of Mermos.\n\nIn Coin Crypt, you play as a lootmancer. A lootmancer is someone who can unlock the hidden power inside of coins and use them in magical duels. This isn't that unique. Now, the objective of the game is to get to the end of each level. Again, not that unique. The ony unique thing about this game is it's art style. I really like this games art style, it's nice, and friendly. But, like I said with Clicker Heroes, (by the way, this game is no where NEAR as bad as Clicker Heroes), the art style is the only thing good about it.\n\nOverall, this game isn't bad. I just wouldn't recommend playing it. This game is okay, at best. if you do like it, that's fine. I just personally don't, mostly because it's just one of those games you play when you are bored.

The original coin values were Mainly in increments of 5 and made quick maths so much easier. No my brain has to attempt to decipher how much of such and such a coin is required to knock the enemy to kingdom come. I'm NOT stupid and I am in top-set maths BUT I find this update unnecessary and infuriating. It was so much better before :sfsmile:\n\nI DO love the mechanics of this game. I DO love the creativity and individual style of this game. I DID love the graphics (they're a bit broken now) and I ADORE the music (Much love to the composer) I hope this review serves also as a report to the dev as I've no idea how to send a report to him. I hope he knows how much I LOVE this game but, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD GO BACK TO EASY VALUES!!!!!\n\nBugs:\nWhen entering a secret area you may sometimes keep entering and exiting accidentally\n'Coin Failed' happens WAY to often, even with a single stack\n\nEDIT: The new update has added some cool stuff but the dev still needs to decide whether he wants the battle system to be turn-based or fast because currently it's in between ideas and has the worst of both worlds (no offence)\n\nANOTHER EDIT: The Dev is amazing, they've changed the graphics to look awesome and charming and the coin system rebalances are great. I do however, hate playing thief and getting one-shotted by a reaper coin but oh well, nevermind. I have come to like the coin system and it's quite good :) Well worth the price\n\nAll Ratings are Out Of 10 (x/10)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|Point-----------|---Before update---|---After Update---|---SUPER UPDATE----|\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|Graphics-------|----------8---------|----------7----------|-----------10--------|\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|Sounds---------|---------9----------|----------9----------|----------9----------|\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|Gameplay-----|-----------8----------|--------4---------|----------7------------|\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|Control---------|----------9----------|---------9---------|-----------8----------|\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|Ingenuity------|----OVER 9000----|----OVER 9000-----|-----OVER 9000-----|\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\nOVERALL RATING Before: 8.7\nAfter  :   5\nAfter After: 9\n\np.s This table took me AGES so please rate up if it helped :)","April 11, 2014","true","27.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Said money can be spend on new unlockable characters (including a monkey, just like the storepage said!! Yay!) But... from what I see, that's about it.\n\nIn the end, I do like the mechanics but I can't get myself to like the game itself.\nThe enemies look kinda nice, but inconsistent. You encounter a Magician... and then a Ghost... and then a Mimic ... and suddenly a Pirate. And what about a story? Why am I on that Island... and suddenly in dungeons and forests? Just what is going on and why?\nA roguelike game doesn't -need- to have a story, or be consistent, but those things keep me going. The Binding of Isaac or Rogue Legacy are good examples for that. Tough, always different, just a bit of a story which unfolds to be bigger than expected.\nAnd even if this turns out to be bigger than expected... I won't get there.\n\nPS. If available on iOS/Android: Go get it there. It'd be a nice game for on the go with little to no story, quick rounds but lots of unlockables and the mechanics are perfect for touch controls.\nIf it's not available on mobile devices: Why the heck not?

You have to donate to a god to to get anywhere. You can try it solo but good luck to you. I do find the game still to be a tad to hard for your average player. I still do not fully understand Trade Coins. I did have to do some investigating to figure out how  the god system works. The game could do with a tip system.. Really needed for the gods. The game can be fun provided your willing to do some homework on this game.\n\nSo for my tips and what I have learned. Give money to one god and give it a good sum and keep at giving it coins your not goiong to use. Running away is sometimes the only way to fight another day. I should also mention this game is easy on the eyes and I do enjoy the sounds as well. Just one more update. I currently have every character unlocked. Played 10 hours and made it some what far did not kill the head honcho . Doubt I will play anymore its just to hard for me to enjoy.  For those that have made it to end you have my hearty congrats.

I love rogue-likes generally, and this one is a new interesting twist. Someone else said it's part deck builder and that actually fits, though if I didn't play a lot of table top games I wouldn't have known what that meant. Basically, as you explore you collect coins. These coins are different abilities, like Hit, or Heal, or Defend. You use these coins in combat, AND in the shop. When you use a coin in combat, it is spent. If you have 4 Hit coins and it takes 2 to kill a mob, then you'll only have 2 left after combat. Seems to be plenty of characters to unlock with different bonuses that change how you attack the levels.

The game basically boils down to 'who can one-shot faster'.  Last run I got hit for 26 damage (your max health is 10) within one second of starting the battle on the fourth stage.  I don't see how that's challenging or interesting.  Likewise, your character usually does anywhere from 4-50 damage to things that have 10-20 health.\n\nBattles rarely last more than a couple rounds.  Your character and options are mostly the same throughout a playthrough.  You get different coins, but they're barely different and only slightly more powerful.  But the worst part is that there are so many different coins (I think over 100) that you can't possibly know what they all do, but you're constantly under a timer with zero leeway, so you can't even read what they do.  You're wind up just clicking and hoping it was a good one.\n\nIt's not all bad: it's basically a deck building game with constant influx and outflux of cards.  That's a pretty fresh take, and was mildly interesting.\n\nThe big problem is there just isn't a whole lot of meat to the game.  Unlock a "good" character and you can breeze through no matter what.  Otherwise, it's just random how far you'll make it.  Sometimes you get good coins and can breeze through.  Sometimes you get crap coins and don't make it past the second floor.\n\nOverall, it was interesting for a couple hours.  I don't think anyone could get more than that out of it.  5/10.  For me it's a pass on recommending it.  I got it in a bundle and wouldn't have played it otherwise.  There are much better roguelites out there.  If the battle system let you actually process what was going on better (i.e. didn't have a constantly running timer), I'd give it a 7/10.  Combat's far too spammy and unsatisfying to really get into it.","July 29, 2015","false","3.6"," 14 of 35 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","14","35","2","1"

And for a bizarre game where you "draft" a bag of coins and have only seconds to respond in combat! The game is also buggy - I started off playing with an Xbox controller, I got stuck in a book in the game that indicated I needed to press LB to exit it, and showed an animation when I pressed that button, but didn't actually let me continue in the game until I switched to the mouse. (Clearly a great couch game! /s) Xbox controller support is generally pretty awkward. Looking through your bag of coins and want to read what a new one does? The obvious choice would be to let you select a coin with the joystick or arrow keys and then show a description for whichever one you selected but not here! No, instead, each coin is assigned a particular directional key to highlight it, perhaps because the dev has a bet with some programmer friends to design the worst UI ever. Also the banner that indicates a coin is new covers up the name of the button you need to press to use it. Yeah, just stick with the mouse...\n\nI'm used to rough-around-edges deck building games (I've put dozens of hours into Dream Quest) and I this game still seems promising, but it desperately needs some improvement.","April 20, 2015","false","8.6"," 6 of 21 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","6","21","0","0"

But, Coin Crypt has an original twist that adds strategy, and enough polish to elevate it above most of the dross early access throws at people now-a-days.\nIn this game, your battle moves are tied to coins. Once you use that coin on attacking, healing or any other move, it disappears. Every coin also has a monetary value that can be used to trade at a variety of points throughout the game. What all of this means is that you always need something, keeping every game exciting. If either side runs out of coins in battle, they lose, but if you defeat an enemy before they run out, you get all of the coins they haven't used. So you always have to becareful with your choices in and out of battle. You might end up with a bag full with attacks just when you're hanging on 3 hp and desparately need a heal, or a bag full of heal coins that limit your attack options significantly and leaves you to wait for the enemy to run out of coins, but then you don't get any attacks from the enemy at the end of battles!\nBut most of the coins don't come from enemies, but from chests. You can only pick a limited number of coins from chests, giving you more choices to make. As the game goes on, more coins of different types get introduced with the enemies and chests, altering your deck to have more coin diversity.\nNaturally for rogue-likes, you will die quite a bit. When you die or win a run you get to spend the coins you got throughout the run into unlocking new characters. Every character plays differently but most if not all of them aren't objectively better than others. You unlock your first classes quite quickly to experiment with but the more you unlock, the more expensive they get. This is the game's way to give a purpose to each playthrough, some people will like it, and some will want a more substantial meta game. There are over 14 classes so to those who do care it will take quite a bit of play to unlock all of them!\nThis is what early access should be, Coin Crypt was already functional from the first time it arrived on steam and has only improved ever since.\nSo, yeah, this is worth a buy!","May 31, 2014","true","161.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But, Coin Crypt has an original twist that adds strategy, and enough polish to elevate it above most of the dross early access throws at people now-a-days.\nIn this game, your battle moves are tied to coins. Once you use that coin on attacking, healing or any other move, it disappears. Every coin also has a monetary value that can be used to trade at a variety of points throughout the game. What all of this means is that you always need something, keeping every game exciting. If either side runs out of coins in battle, they lose, but if you defeat an enemy before they run out, you get all of the coins they haven't used. So you always have to becareful with your choices in and out of battle. You might end up with a bag full with attacks just when you're hanging on 3 hp and desparately need a heal, or a bag full of heal coins that limit your attack options significantly and leaves you to wait for the enemy to run out of coins, but then you don't get any attacks from the enemy at the end of battles!\nBut most of the coins don't come from enemies, but from chests. You can only pick a limited number of coins from chests, giving you more choices to make. As the game goes on, more coins of different types get introduced with the enemies and chests, altering your deck to have more coin diversity.\nNaturally for rogue-likes, you will die quite a bit. When you die or win a run you get to spend the coins you got throughout the run into unlocking new characters. Every character plays differently but most if not all of them aren't objectively better than others. You unlock your first classes quite quickly to experiment with but the more you unlock, the more expensive they get. This is the game's way to give a purpose to each playthrough, some people will like it, and some will want a more substantial meta game. There are over 14 classes so to those who do care it will take quite a bit of play to unlock all of them!\nThis is what early access should be, Coin Crypt was already functional from the first time it arrived on steam and has only improved ever since.\nSo, yeah, this is worth a buy!","May 31, 2014","true","161.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a few glitches with the wandering monster AI getting stuck on walls, the secret rooms feel too random and many of the shop items are either useless or unaffordable.\n\nBut it IS fun, and fast paced, and the combat system is pretty original.

The player carries around a bag of coins, each kind of coin having a different effect in battle and a value outside of battle. Coins are consumed when used in combat and must be used to appease gods and possibly buy items outside of it, so the pool of coins is constantly in flux. Coins can be obtained as loot drops from enemies, stolen or obtained upon defeating them, and from chests. Each unlockable player character has different abilities that make different kinds of decks more effective.\n\nIn short, the game is easy to pick up and play, but it provides virtually endless variety.","February 14, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very short (less than half an hour if you win, but it's not unlikely that you'll die in the first or second combat) but very replayable. The combat system's not really deep, but it is varied and well-balanced (far more so than it appears at first glance), both between offense and defense and between the different coins you can use for each. There are a few glitches with the wandering monster AI getting stuck on walls, the secret rooms feel too random and many of the shop items are either useless or unaffordable.\n\nBut it IS fun, and fast paced, and the combat system is pretty original. And the difficulty is even throughout the whole game instead of overly easy or hard at the beginning.

The core mechanics are familiar but the game as a whole is so unique that I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for something fresh.  The art direction is remniscent of a cel-shaded Minecraft-inspired Wonderland.  It's a real treat exploring this world each and every run.\n\nI'm actually very surprised that I never heard anyone talking about this game on any podcast, stream, or video.  Games like Coin Crypt, Crypt Of The Necrodancer, Speedrunners, and Dungeon Of The Endless take huge risks doing something very different..  But they are not merely noteworthy because they're different.  These are games that are TONS of fun and great to go back to any time.\n\nAdmittedly, the only thing missing from Coin Crypt is some sort of online support or multiplayer.  I reckon this hidden gem got overlooked because it is a singleplayer experience.  I see they released DLC in 2015 so, hopefully, this game gets more of a cult following and steady updates to revitalize interest.  It's a game I can't recommend enough if you dig exploration, dungeon crawlers, rogue-likes, or just charming/cute games that are clever AND fun!","January 8","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can't really do damage all the time, as each turn you can choose to use between 3 randomly drawn coins.\nThe enemies are different, certain types tend to use certain coin types, which is neat.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yogizilla/recommended/264690/","Yogizilla","Yogizilla - GeekyAntics!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yogizilla/","337 products in account","Coin Crypt is an ambitious title that actually delivers in terms of replay value and fun factor.  The core mechanics are familiar but the game as a whole is so unique that I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for something fresh.  The art direction is remniscent of a cel-shaded Minecraft-inspired Wonderland.  It's a real treat exploring this world each and every run.\n\nI'm actually very surprised that I never heard anyone talking about this game on any podcast, stream, or video.  Games like Coin Crypt, Crypt Of The Necrodancer, Speedrunners, and Dungeon Of The Endless take huge risks doing something very different..  But they are not merely noteworthy because they're different.  These are games that are TONS of fun and great to go back to any time.\n\nAdmittedly, the only thing missing from Coin Crypt is some sort of online support or multiplayer.  I reckon this hidden gem got overlooked because it is a singleplayer experience.  I see they released DLC in 2015 so, hopefully, this game gets more of a cult following and steady updates to revitalize interest.  It's a game I can't recommend enough if you dig exploration, dungeon crawlers, rogue-likes, or just charming/cute games that are clever AND fun!","January 8","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Cool graphics but low res/buggy looking. Would look better on a phone's screen but controls best with a mouse. Text is a bit hard to read because of the font. DLC would have been better off included in the game and would have made the game feel a bit more finished/rounded out.\n\nFun looking game, Gameplay is weird, but doesn't quite make a lot of sense. You use coins as weapons but... what happens when you have no coins or none that can be used to attack enemies? neat game.","December 30, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The coin mechanics are surprisingly deep, and extremely addictive. The large number of unlockable classes means you can find a strategy/playstyle that suits you that will be wildly different from someone else's (demon is my favorite). However, I've pretty much run out of content at 10 hours. There doesn't seem to be much point in playing the game after beating the main mode, and the forge, aside from the random daily challenge and finding the rest of the enemies. I haven't played the sea and sky expansion yet, I think I might just so I can have something else to do. The ads for it in-game are kind of obnoxious, especially if you're a completionist. I'd recommend buying this if it's on deep sale or something. Give it a shot!","April 29","true","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
