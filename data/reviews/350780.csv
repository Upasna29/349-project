"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FutureFriendSA/recommended/350780/","FutureFriendSA","SKULL & GOKUBONES","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FutureFriendSA/","1345 products in account","This is my only serious review because this game is on several of my friend's wishlist and I want to warn them.\n\nThis game is really horrid, it's basicly everything wrong with NES homage games. It looks ugly as hell, the game design seems intended to kill you instead of giving you a challenge to deal with. Even if this game was made bad in a ironic way, there is no actual fun to be derived from that. The only humor in it is "Did you see this MST3K episode? Well here's a reference to that". Which I wouldn't mind if I was speaking to my nerd friends, but just saying "look at these funnier people and what they joked about" does not constitute as a good joke for it's own premise.\n\nAbout half the levels take place in the dark with only a small cone of light around you, which wouldn't be so bad if your cone of light wasn't barely bigger than your character. This creates a large amount of problems because the game just loves to throw enemies at you that knock you back into pits. You could potentially deal with this problem by just shooting what's coming up, but a lot of enemies home in on you from above, where you cannot shoot or are outright invincible. The final level is a auto-scrolling level that goes up, while you can't see what's actually appearing above. If you go too fast you will not notice the ball and chain that has just spawned that will knock you back all the way. There is a moment where they do this twice, one after another.\n\nThere is one level which is a plane level where you control a huge ♥♥♥ plane that covers atleast 1/6th of the screen. You die in one hit and it is nearly uncontrollable. The boss of that level is a giant chicken head and a plane which shoots small bullets you can barely see.\n\nThe game also just loves to cheat, early on there is a boss which changes your invincibility period to half a second, thus causing it to hit you multiple times if it so deems. This boss also is later reused in another game made by the same developer, so that tells you the effort put into it.\n\nThe music is decent, though. It's functional and does it's job well, never sounding unpleasant. However, not the same can be said of the sound effects. There is one enemy in the game that has a noise that can be accurately described as "Screamer midi as back in the dial up days". There is a UFO enemy that's spawned everywhere in one level that just the most painful noise known to man.\n\nIf you want to get a good homage to old NES games, I would suggest Shovel Knight. It is a better game than most NES games. If you want a funny bad game, just play Bad Rats, it's better than this is ever gonna get.\n\nOh also, the game outright didn't want to accept my DualShock 3 controller, no matter what program I used or input I set it at.\n\nUpdate: As of this date, the dev has personally told me that they added a health bar to the plane level, this atleast negates my criticisms about that part. (Also 69% found this review helpful right now which is in fact Very Nice)\n\nUpdate 2: The dev of this game tweetsearches himself and whined about this review for 3 days on his twitter. Got blocked when I told him in 3 different ways to stop tweetsearching himself. I have pretty much done what every game journalist sets out to do, so I now know what career I have perfected.\n\nUpdate 3: He apologized, we all good.","August 1, 2015","false","1.1"," 143 of 210 people (68%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","68","143","210","17","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/psychedelicsa/recommended/350780/","psychedelicsa","Psych","http://steamcommunity.com/id/psychedelicsa/","417 products in account","Original premise for a game... too bad the game itself is an unoriginal NES platformer.\n\nAs Mike, you must survive through Valley Lodge by leaving your family behind in order to jump, run and shoot snakes with a pistol. Sometimes you get a shotgun, which shoots a three-way projectile that won't hit anything else than whatever's in front of you. The first two levels of the game follow the movie, but everything is thrown out the window once you reach Level 3, which looks like Castlevania... as in it reuses the same graphics! Also, the boss of this level was supposedly so good it got reused in AVGN Adventures.\n\nWhen Level 4 starts, your protagonist says "What a horrible night to have a missing wife and child!". Enough said.\n\nAs the game advances, the game stops bothering with Manos and becomes a Mystery Science Theater 3000 tribute. Tom Servo does a cameo in Level 2 and most levels involve enemies from other B-movies like Hobgoblins, Robot Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space. Why call it Manos then? The setting fails because the writing is all centered on references, trying really hard to wink at you and say "Hey this happened in the movie, right?"\n\nThe game could have been good if the gameplay was interesting, but it isn't. You only shoot in a horizontal line and enemies just bounce back and forth forever, making fighting a joyless affair. Bosses are equally as mindless. The only challenge the game offers comes from occasionally unfair enemy and trap placement, where upon hitting them, you will bounce back in a pit and die. The game sometimes spice things up by making the whole screen dark around you, preventing you from anticipating obstacles and multiplying deaths where you fall in pits. Other levels are autoscrollers, which don't really have a reason for happening and forces you to progress at the game's pace. There's also a vertical autoscrolling level that rips off Castlevania 3.\n\nOverall presentation is also weak. The graphics and sound are appropriately NES-styled, but they have no substance and fail at making an impression. The game also offers difficulty levels, but don't bother with them: all they do is remove health pickups, shotguns and checkpoints from levels. Yes, it makes the game harder, but it doesn't make it fun.\n\nManos will take you about 45 minutes to finish, maybe more if you want to get the full ending or finish the Torgo playthrough, which just switches sprites, makes you do lots of annoying noises and is slippery as all hell. The complete unoriginality is what mainly kills the game though; it doesn't attempt to add anything new to the old-school game formula, unlike games like Shovel Knight, Binding of Isaac or Axiom Verge. This game is about as faithful to its source material than a LJN game would be, so it's good at reminding you of LJN!","August 10, 2015","false","1.0"," 30 of 43 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","30","43","2","0"

Of course you do, that's why you're here. Let's be honest for a minute; there is nothing groundbreaking about this game. It is a standard sidescrolling platform shooter. But ya see, that's the very thing that makes it beautiful. If you yearn for the good-ole-days of gaming where all you needed was a glass of sweet tea, your faithful NES Advantage controller, and a weekend to play your newest rental from Blockbuster... then you should really do yourself a favor and pick up this game. There are plenty of in-jokes from the MST3K series to make you chuckle, the gameplay is solid and straight to the point, the music is beautifully rendered, and the achievements will keep you playing. The game is a bit short, but many were from the era that this game faithfully emulates. It does, however, have replay value. If you liked the Manos episode of MST3K, or NES era sidescrollers, then you will enjoy this game.","December 18, 2015","true","2.4"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Graphics are pixel art, you can switch off the grain effect.\n\nSometing more about gameplay:\n- the flow is decent, you have unlimited continues from the main menu if you lose all lives albeit you will lose all points (who cares anyway)\n- there is one additional weapon - the shotgun, which is quite powerful one hit killing enemies but you lose it after being hit just one\n- the locations are very nicely done with very little unfairly positioned enemies (maybe once or twice I've encountered such a ♥♥♥♥ move that you can die seconds after respawning if you would not react very quickly)\n- music is quite nice, but this is not the main point of the game\n\nThe big plus of this one are many references to movies - you can find a Giant Claw, this ape with a radio/diving helmet thing on it's head, one level that is inspired by Plan 9 from Outer Space and so on.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game. You will get a decent treat for not that much money.\n\nAdditional comments - there is a different ending when you collect all so called Hands of Fate items. After completing game once you unlock Torgo as a playable character, but it may be a bit hard to play as he's sliding a bit when you stop moving, so I can imagine that you must be constantly moving in order to avoid falling into pits.","November 1, 2015","true","1.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Set in a retro horror world with an NES homage, you control Mike and play through the game Super Mario style. Be prepared for some rage-quits, especially on higher levels of difficulty. I've played my fair share of difficult indie platformers so i'm trying my best to separate the justified and unjustified rage-quits. Of course there will be times when you see that flying UFO, but forget that it was coming and reacted too late. Or the times when the swinging spikes just happen to clip you mid-jump. This is all normal in a challenging platformer. The issue comes with respawn locations, poor enemy placement, or poor design choices. For example, one time i was respawned on the last (elevator) level on a single-block ledge with two flying eyeballs almost instantly bumping me off seconds upon revival. Another time, a creature bugged out on the stairs leading downwards, getting stuck in my path. Not able to kill him, i tried to jump over him which ended up killing me because i was not in direct contact with the stairs, causing me to touch the bottom frame of the game.....Dying too many times will reset your score and force you to replay the entire level, reliving through the terrible situations previously dealt with.\n\n==== Score ====I actually like MANOS for the most part as it was more fun than aggravating; however, due to a couple bugs and really poor design choices, i really can't advise getting this game at the moment. If patched or fixed, I would definitely recommend this game as the retro style adaptation added a nice flair setting it apart from the common crowd of indie platformers out there.\n\nFine\n- 6/10","November 16, 2015","false","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You'd have to watch it to understand why. Fans of the genre might want to buy Shovel Knight before this if they've never seen MST3K or Manos. If you're interested, you can watch both on Youtube.

I've been following this game since before it was Greenlit, but I just can't recommend it as is.","December 21, 2015","false","1.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

It's also rife with references to other infamously bad movies, most featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000, with the exception of Plan 9 From Outer Space, Troll 2, and The Giant Claw. The game is an action-platformer remniscent of Castlevania, but you get a gun instead of a whip. You can also get a shotgun that fires 3 shots (like the Spreader from Contra), but you lose it if you are hit once. You can also find other items by shooting the hand statues through the levels. There are flashing Hands Of Fate items that increase your max health too, and you can an achievement if you find them all. Another novelty worth mentioning is the film grain, which can be turned on and off in the Options menu.\n\nThe game is rather short however. I was able to beat it within a half-hour.

This helps a lot in the visibility portion, but the forced shadow effects that don't fit into the game still create a huge problem later in the game when an already difficult game is made more so just because you can't see where you're supposed to jump.

Sure, the knock back was beyond even what Castlevania made you work with, but hey, I could deal with it. That is, of course, until I reached the auto-scroller that obscured your vision... then the knock back became a major issue.\n\nSpeaking of auto-scrolling, I assumed that the first one would also be the last; you know, just toss in that old convention of the platformer needing at least one of them. I could deal again, I personally don't like them, but I assumed I had gotten the worst out the way, or at least half of it, since sometimes they toss in a second one just to remind you that this is an NES style platformer. Boy was I wrong, as the last half of the game is almost nothing BUT vision obscured auto-scrollers!\n\nSo now that the fun had been completely sucked out of the game, I reached the vertical auto-scroller pulled straight out of Castlevania III... except, again, with obscured vision, because that never gets old, right? Only it came complete with checkpoints that were designed in such a way that enemy spawns could kill you within two seconds of your own spawn for that authentic controller snapping frustration of losing your last life by getting knocked off a small platform by a giant eyeball within a second of respawning.\n\nThis game falls under Nintendo hard to be sure, but such a thing is divided into two camps; cheap and an actual, well constructed challenge. When I die, I feel like it's not because I lack skill but because I was cheated: the knock back, the fact that I cannot see anything while the screen pushes me along, the blunt and forced memorization in order to get anywhere in half of the game, all of the slam head into brick wall until it gives tactics are in full force in this game.

Just a perfect difficulty so it can  be enjoyed by all.\nManos definately deserves to be played by anyone who has had or has a fondness for these games.  Definately a well kept secret masterpiece.  This is literally one of the very\nfew times I write a public review for a game, For anything for that matter. But after playing this, At these late hours of the night , i felt compelled to do it. I had to, Infact I cant even fathom anyone writing a negative review.  Thats just heartless.  Thank God for Steam, that provide a medium for these types of games to be made  accessable for us. And for devolpers like "FreakZone" that keep our imaginations alive! Thank You! Long Live FreakZone!","March 31","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
