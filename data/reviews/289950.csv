No game is perfect, but this one has just the right recipe for me.\nIn addition, a year after release the devs are still very attentive, cranking out updates, bug fixes and DLC. They have also released editing tools and tutorial videos for the modding community.\n\nI've seen negative reviews written by people who played only a few hours, were stumped by some problem outside the game (computer or network problems, most often game controller problems) and had no patience to try to make it work for them. I use two full-size joysticks, a steering wheel and pedals, with no problem whatsoever. All these devices are 10 years old and my computer is 6 years old.\n\nI've also seen complaints by people with unrealistic expectations. While CS2015 is not a perfect technical simulator (what do you expect, it is based on the Unity engine), it is realistic enough that it WILL help you with real-life operation. For example, I sometimes use excavators in real life, and playing this game with two full-size joysticks helps me maintain and improve my dexterity. Also, it is not focused on simulating a single machine, but rather a broad range of them.\n\nBut simulation is not the core of this game. Having fun building, driving, operating machines is what it's about, especially in multi-player sessions, which are where the game shines. Some players have complained that there is too much driving, too much delivery. These people obviously have never observed a real-life construction site. It's all about delivering materials when needed and setting them in place with machines. That is what the game does. Running around hammering nails would make a very boring game.\n\n","December 1, 2015","true","837.5"," 174 of 186 people (94%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","94","174","186","21","9"

I've been around tractors since I was 3, everybody in my family was in construction at some point or another, it's in my blood. So when I saw there was another heavy equipment sim out, I decided to try it, and approached it with an eager, open mind.\n\nMy only other experience with construction sims is with Demolition Company; that was a fun game, but it left you wanting more freedom and construction activities. this game offers just that.\n\nBugs:\nI don't think this game is as bug ridden as people say it is, you've just really got to pay attention to the details. For example: One user wrote he was upset because he was unable to exceed 10KPM in the tipper. I ran into this same issue, then I realized I didn't secure my load and retract the booms all the way. Once I did, I accelerated to much higher speeds.\n\nPhysics:\nIf you've ever operated a real machine, or simply a hand shovel, the digging physics in this game are going to annoy you at first. The excavator physics (once I finally set the joystick functions to CAT/standard US) I was soon annoyed by how unrealistic the digging is. Then I realized how the game thinks you should dig (you'll learn, lol) and it was smooth sailing from there. Digging seems to be the hardest physic to animate and develop for a game, hence the reason this is as far as it's come so far.\n\nI just barely finished the tutorial but, so far, I like the game despite it's quirks. Still, I'm glad on only spend the 60% off sale price on it.\n\nBe patient, I have a feeling things will only get better with these construction simulators. More machines and better physics are inevitable. Just look how far other simulation games have come. Flight Simulator 2000 anybody?","May 26, 2015","true","13.9"," 138 of 153 people (90%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","90","138","153","16","0"

By that I mean, you essentially take various vehicles (flatbeds, dump trucks, cement mixers etc) and drive them from the job site, to the necessary materials dealer. There you purchase the materials, load up with a forklift, or some other medium, and transport them back to the job site. At the job site, you will perform a specific task, that can be tedious/dull/etc. OR, it can be exactly what you're hoping it will be. Allow me to elaborate.\n\nWith the mini excavator for example. You're often assigned a task of digging a small trench. As you may expect... this takes time. It's quite repetitive, but it is in fact digging, which is a component of construction, and frankly... a feature that many of you should be interested in playing this game.\n\nI've also used extensively the larger flatbed truck with the crane attached to it. This vehicle I find a little annoying, because the darn health and safety rubes have had their way, and I'm unable to reposition it without completely retracting the boom, and stowing it.\n\nWhat about the many complaints?\n\nWell... I think the physics are quite alright. Certainly not perfect, but then again... I don't think the physics in Kerbal Space Program, Euro Truck Simulator, or Microsoft Flight Sim are perfect either. BUT... this game is still VERY playable with the current setup. I would'nt even think to consider the physics to be "game breaking".\n\nOther people have complained of game crashing bugs or glitches. I haven't encountered a single one. I thought my game had crashed once, but it was actually my laptop going into hibernate because I had exhausted the battery playing this game.\n\nAlso the controls. I'm not entirely sure what people expect here? I'm also not sure what the issue is? I play this game just fine using the keyboard and mouse... INCLUDING some of the more complex equipment. I'm not certain a controller would make it easier either. Fact. Excavators have MANY controls. They have to bind them somewhere on a PC... and while the learning curve may be present, it certainly isn't steep. Controls are a non-factor here. Simple as that.\n\nSo then... should you BUY this game?\nIf you're looking for a game where you can drive some abstract trucks that have a LOT of extra gizmo type functionality (crane parts, dumpers, stabilizers, etc)... and you don't mind doing the leg work involved in ACTUAL construction, with some stages of digging, dumping, pouring, craning added in... then yes. This game is solid. 8/10.\n\nIf you're looking for something with a little more hands on, and less transporting... then no. Leave it be.\n\nTHE BEST WAY I CAN DESCRIBE THIS GAME IS!\nIt's like Euro Truck Simulator, with slightly different physics, and the added task of doing the work at the delivery sites, rather than simply delivering. It adds that extra little bit. A great starting point to build off of. But not perfect.\n\nOverall, 7/10. If you're a sim nerd, or a construction fan... bump it to 8/10. If you're looking for ETS... I won't drop any points, but just go play ETS.","November 26, 2014","true","22.4"," 105 of 110 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","105","110","2","0"

I've played tons of early access and alpha / beta games, so bugs and glitches don't mean a whole lot to me. Often they can add a bit of unintended fun to the game and maybe even a few laughs like the flying, hovering, bouncing and wall climbing AI cars in this game - something that seems to have been fixed with the latest updates (sad face: no more fun flying cars).\n\nIf anything, I would say that the guys behind this game have gone that extra mile to come up with a very decent way of presenting menus and interaction with the game components. Community suggestions for improving the game UI have been added into the game time and again, just like community feedback on glitches and bugs have been fixed.\nLately a number of major fixes and feature upgrades have been released, which has just made the game that much better.\n\nI've got 70+ hours on this game, even with glitches and hick-ups and I have never really run into anything truely game breaking anywhere in the game. The concept is strong and solid, the missions are nicely varied and there is a nice enough selection of vehicles and work horses in the game to make it that much more fun playing a "simple" simulator. You get to actually dig and move dirt using excavators and trucks, pour cement on building parts and step-by-step build anything from small houses to huge appartment complexes. I wont spoil the game, except to hint that there are special missions worth your time and focus.\n\nWhen I saw the release of the first DLC for this game, which contains an additional tower crane I didnt even blink before I had completed the Steam transaction for the purchase (the only other game I have ever done this with is EuroTruck Simulator 2). Don't mind the haters on the community hub demanding 6,000 other vehicles: they just want the game to play for them ;)\n\nIf you like simulators and heavy equipment, then do not hold yourself back on this title. With or without a discount, it's worth the money regardless. On the plus side, you get a decent amount of unintended fun moments at no extra charge!\n\nMy personal oppinion is that the "Mixed" review status no longer applies. The game deserves a more positive status! So do I recomend this game? Yup, definately.","May 28, 2015","true","88.3"," 87 of 95 people (92%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","92","87","95","8","0"

However, so far into the game it seems that it should be called "construction material transport simulator" rather than construction... It seems that the good stuff does not start to happen in the game anytime soon.\n\nAll I have been doing go buy this go buy that and bring it to the construction site with the occasional dig here dig there. The game is pretty slow. Graphics are not very appealing, everything seems flat. there isn't even animation in buildings rising from the ground and becoming something beautiful. Bring in material, done, texture pop-in a house made of bricks all of a sudden.\n\nWould I recommend this game? No, unfortunately. This simulator could have been A LOT better than that. Nevertheless, I am not slamming the door on this game should it become a franchise and see later iterations i.e 2016 2017 etc. Unless Construction simulator becomes a better game later down the road, this will be the first and last I'll ever buy.\n\nIf I want to compare, there is for example, Euro truck simulator 2, it is simply driving a truck from point A to point B delivering orders and that is it. This sounds miles more boring that construction simulator, I have done about 48 hours driving trucks around europe. Why is that you might ask, because it is VERY good at what it does, the gameplay feels right the truck weight, the handling with or without a light or heavy trailer loads, the graphics are alright and there are also very good quality attributes in that game.\n\nIf you are unsure about this game, find some youtube "lets play" videos and see if you like the game.

The crane elements work particularly well, the flatbed with the extending boom crane is a particular favourite.  Excavation could be better, but once you get used to its quirks you can get along with it easily.\nI wouldn't put much stock in Youtubers playing this, none of them seem to have gotten very far.  The large Liebherr excavator is much more satisfying than the small one you start out with, I think you'll find the small ones are pretty pathetic in reality too!\nThere can be a lot of driving in this, and for me this REALLY needs TrackIR or Oculus Rift.  Games with cockpits are transformed completely by adding these things, it really brings them to life.\nOn top of that, simple things like controls for gears, brakes etc aren't there which further detracts from any realism.\n\nIf you don't like a particular element of the game, later you can just get your employees to do it.  You don't earn XP, but you do earn money so you can go off and do whatever you like.  Once you get a second foreman, the money just roles in and you can start building your fleet.\nThe way emplyees and foreman work needs some changes, you can't get them to do a whole job, neither can they manage themselves (despite being your senior).\n\nI hope the modding gets going with this, I would particularly like the ability to change attachments on excavators, similar to farm simulator.

I have to admit that i also had a rough start with it. Bought it and tried it for around 1 hour. I found it to be boring and controls were not so good. I abandoned the game for a few months and came back to it a week ago when i was bored. And i restarted my profile from scratch. Once i had enough patience to do some jobs that got me some money and experience i have unlocked new machinery and new building sites.

I dig the sense of accomplishment when you and 3 buddies have worked for 2-3 hours on something and finally finish it.  Some of the late game jobs can take quite a while from start to finish, which is nice, but can be tedious.\n\n2) The complexity of some of the machines is quite engrossing IE: the concrete pump; mobile crane; tower crane, just to name a few.  The overall detail of the machines is quite decent, this coming from working in the industry and seeing these machines on a daily basis.(To be fair, that's in Canada, so I'm referring to the North American counterparts; JD; CAT, etc etc.)\n\n3) The Story(such as it is); is a nice touch.  Just enough to add a little bit of flavor.  Mainly I like the "Special Jobs" that come up from time to time.\n\n4) All things considered I found the price reasonable for the time you can get out of it.  I've personally got just under 70 hours on it, most of which has been enjoyable.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n1) The sheer amount of bugs/crashes from a released product is somewhat off putting, most of which existing in multiplayer.  It is somewhat disappointing that it was released in this state but it is what it is.  The updates for these issues have been slow to come but have been addressing some of them.\n\n2) The sync issues in multiplayer with the more complex machines; Excavators; concrete pumps; anything with a crane, can get extremely annoying; recently I've been noticing that another player will do a fair bit of pumping only to have the job unfinished when from his point of view it's done.  I as the host have to come back to the jobsite and finish the pumping.  Again, extremely annoying when you're running 3 jobsites all with varying complexity and you have to run back and forth between them all to finish phases other players start because of sync problems.\n\n3) The physics engine gets.... What's the word...... ADHD??!? From time to time a vehicle, machine, or otherwise equipment will randomly start flipping ♥♥♥♥, and USUALLY right in the middle of unloading/loading a large complicated load causing the freight to go airborne, sometimes travelling as far as Home Base(Village) after having launched from the Materials Provider(city).  Other times I've had it take over 2 hours to load up everything on the Lowboy trailer for delivery to 3 different jobsites only to have the skids/freight schiz out part way through loading and scatter themselves across the lot.  This sort of thing I would expect from an Early Access product, but not from a finished game.  The developers have been doing updates, a fair of which has been for sync and physics issues but the updating hasn't quite sorted it out.  Hopefully in the near future it will.\n\nOVERVIEW:\n\nThe hours of gameplay that haven't been ruined by bugs, sync issues, and the like far outweighs the hours that have. The small group of friends that always play together have a laugh while doing so, even when the bugs hit.  All in all, I recommend the game to anyone interested, but at the same time, I would also recommend coming into it with an open mind.  If you like simulators, plus construction, you'll like this game.\n\nPatience is a virture 2015 10/10\nWould have an excavator dig a basement whilst upside down and lodged into the neighboring house again.","February 17, 2015","true","126.9"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","25","28","7","0"

There are several bugs that need and will get fixed. The physics are great in some aspects and others not so great. Driving is a nightmare if you drive too fast but once you get used to driving it isn't quite as bad. As far as the controls for the excavator, boom truck and crane I have to say they are very realistic. I used to be in construction so I have plenty of experience with and excavator and limited with a crane but I have been driving a boom truck for the past 8 years and I will say it is as close to realistic as you will get. The missions do get a little repetative like some of the other posters stated, drive here and get this, then take it to site, dig a hole and clear the site. Job Well Done. I'm certain they will add more features later and I have only been playing for 6 hours so there may still be more to come.\n\nAll in all I do recommend this game and it is worth the price if you want to play it bad enough, if you can wait for a price drop then do so, if not buy it and have fun.","November 19, 2014","true","39.9"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

However, this game - despite it's rough edges (which are actually being address by the developers) - is actually among the better one's I've viewed and/or bought.\n\nI buy these sorts of games because I like the business sim/management side of things and my two sons enjoy watching the machines at work. The models are very good, the physics engine works as you'd expect - unsecured loads drift around the tray at speed, cabins bounce etc. The controls don't really feel intuitive to begin with, but after a few contracts you're relying less and less on the 'HELP' menu.\n\nI'll admit that it can get a bit repetitive, i.e. "Go to site with this equipment", "Go to outlet, get these supplies, bring to site", "Prepare site" etc. but isn't that how every contruction job basically goes anyway? Rock up, figure out what equipment and supplies you'll need, bring them to the site and commence work? And when you're done, clean it all up? At least from my obersvations of construction sites around my area - couple buildings but mostly road works. So while it does feel like groundhog day, it's really part and parcel with any real-life construction job.\n\nI haven't tested multiplayer and I don't expect to - I doubt any of my friends would enjoy this kind of thing: as I said, I mainly bought this game for my two sons to watch me play to keep them out of mum's hair for an hour or so.\n\nFrom a business-sim perspective, for me it's both good and bad. Contracts seem "reaonsably priced", you're getting 5 figure contracts pretty much straight away - basically it's not a constant grind to get the more lucartive contracts. Unless I somehow have it on "Easy" difficulty...I should check that... Regardless, there are many contracts and many of them pay well. The downside is that hiring personnel is level-based, so you can't hire workers right away and go nuts taking contracts to build your business or potentially go bust and have to fire everyone... You're almost certain to NOT fail the way it's set up. That could be seen as a good thing, but to me there's not a whole lot of risk...at least not so far.\n\nI'm nearly three hours in and the only bug I've noticed was on completion of a job and when the fence to the property was reapplied to the map, my several ton small excavator nearly went into orbit. Aside from that one instance, I've not had any other problems.\n\nPeople complaining they can't load vehicles on trailers or drive vehicles (unless it is an actual bug) just need to calm down, bring up the 'HELP' menu (the '?') and look at the controls for their vehicle or trailer. Some functions, like securing loads, only occurs from outside the vehicle - you can't do it from the cab, just like real life. The controls can be 'dumbed down', I was playing it with realistic controls however I have since switched to arcade style controls as I use a keyboard and mouse.\n\nThis game is obviously not everyone's cup of tea, so to speak, however if you are into running your own business and going from small time outfit to large scale construction magnate as well as 'getting on the tools', then this game is pretty solid so far. If my friends were into this sort of game, I'd recommend it to them and I'm not mad I bought this game either so as far as sales pitches go - if you're into this sort of thing, it's worth the US$26.99 I paid. If you're expecting to bring down the town in a giant excavator rampage or run through the city COD style insta-killing everyone with a shovel or jackhammer I'd give it a miss: this is a construction simulator, not a 'lunatic goes nuts in an excavator, with a shovel or a jackhammer' simulator.","November 21, 2014","true","2.7"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

I was wrong to do that. Ok it is not the winner of this year’s innovation award but it has its own merits. When diving into the game I soon realised it is far more satisfying having something to show for your efforts in this sort of simulator game. This game certainly wins out over the likes of farming simulator in that regard, giving you some nice scenery and results as well as progression in the form of bigger and better missions to boot.\n\nBug bearsThe fun is a little interrupted as whenever you make any sort of in-game transition (be it between tasks/jobs or switching to online mode/accepting a co-worker into your world) the game seems to almost perform a full world-reload for some and just blacks the screen for no reason for others. Annoying but not the end of the world.\n\nOne thing you may also find irritating is the games happy way of stopping all keyboard/gamepad input when showing an information window or a mission completion window/achievement window etc. This allows you to career into many, many objects with your very expensive vehicles and, subsequently, have to reset them due to the physics issues (see below).\n\nThe biggest bug bear with the games intentional features however (as always with Simulator games of this type) is the driver AI. Neither I nor anyone I know is capable of working out why all Simulator game AI cars are all built entirely of lead and have no sense of road rules whatsoever. Pulling out in front of you as you hurtle along in your articulated lorry full of materials seems daft until you realise that they must know they are capable of halting you in your tracks sending your load and truck flying.\n\n\n\nJust plain bugsIn its current build (1.06 at time of writing) there are serious issues with the physics in-game. In single-player this is noticeable but not game-breaking. Odd vehicle resets aren't an issue but having to quit entirely and re-load gets tiresome.\n\nThis is nothing, however, compared to the heavy synchronisation issues with multiplayer co-op. Doing things with your friends in this game is great fun and gives all players something to root for as well as do. But with the physics (and synchronisation thereof) issues it is almost unplayable. This can be quickly seen by attempting to load a flatbed truck with two forklifts at the same time. The only saviour then is to delegate tasks solely to individuals which takes the fun out of it for me.\n\n\nConclusionOverall, I would say this game is in need of some spit and polish as well as a little less loading screen and a little more actual transition. Then it would be great. Until then it is good, but frustrating.","December 28, 2014","false","15.6"," 35 of 55 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","35","55","4","0"

Very little sleep combined with the antics of multiple friends online have made this game great value for money - it's a great team work game.\n\nThe physics can be a little bit funky at times, but they can also be helpful because if they flip out, you know you're doing something wrong and you need to adjust your approach. I've been on the lookout for a multiplayer construction based sim for a number of years, and I'm surprised that this one slipped past me until recently.\n\nPros:\n* Good, but simplistic graphics allow it to run on a range of hardware\n* Good physics, although they can completely flip out and cause some (funny) problems\n* Authentic like heavy machinery and handling\n* Interior cockpit views add immersion and another level of difficulty\n* Trying to plan ahead for which vehicles are required and how to manage funds, especially in a group, is rewarding\n\nCons:\n* Sounds are fairly basic, especially engines or the same horn on every vehicle\n* Jobs are mostly structured the same, but with just enough variance so it isn't completely repetitive\n* No repercussions from causing havoc in the city, such as ramming into cars or signs\n\nThe cons are more nitpicky than anything. Personally, I'd like to see some more simulation like aspects, such as fuel usage, vehicle failures or fines for causing city damage (running into cars/signs/people/etc).\n\nOverall though, I highly recommend this one if you're looking for a game that combines logistics, freight/handling of goods, managing a construction company and using heavy machinery with a group of friends.","January 3","true","45.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","10","11","3","2"

There is no "time crunch".\nThere are even some "shortcuts" the game gives you if you are really tired of digging or concrete pump work.\nFortunately, you can hire workers, but its too bad you cannot interact with them and join the work like some other games of the genre.\nIts not a REAL simulation however as time scale is fast, and controls are still simplified for non-equipment operators.\nHowever, you are going to have to put in a few hours to get good with the controls and be proficient anyway.\nFor example:  The Concrete Pump Truck, has 8 sets of controls to have to use simultaneously, but the design makes is fairly straightforward to understand with minimal fuss.\nFor some people, this game is going to seem like a LOT of work.\n\nHowever, it is a great game for more than one player as you can multitask, and have it count towards your construction company progress.  THAT IS FUN.\n\nRecommended if you like building construction projects and running heavy equipment.\nIf you think simulations games are "work", you will not like it.\nStill working towards that $10 million in the bank (although it is "fake" money).\nConstruction is ALWAYS hard work!","May 28, 2015","true","61.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

My overall rating on the game is 8.5/10. I recomend waiting atlest 3 second before you do anything after the game has loaded anything, it may prevent it from crashing as frequently. Also, if the game if crashing frequently, just tone down the graphix one notch. I hope you enjoy the game as much as I do and don't wish you haven't bought it!

In my opinion for what I've seen so far... the game is pretty good especially for a Astergon game. My only 3 cons is the Cockpit Camera isn't centered for ♥♥♥♥ on where it's suppose to be centered (ITS CENTERED IN THE CENTER OF THE CAB) and Bad Optimization (I have a GTX 750Ti) and Farming Simulator physics. But the story line and the progression of the game is SOOO well thought out that I would give this game a 8/10. If you're not a huge fan of "heavy machienery (might be proper English :P) then I wouldn't recommend the game. I came into this game with an open-mind and I was right. The main menu's are simple and sharp, the game has a slight visual blur if you look hard enough (strangly it makes up for the performance). The reverse audio isn't... headphone friendly. Keyboard controls suck *** I MUCH rather prefer a controller (I use a XBox 360 controller). All in all  if Astergon just keeps throwing out patches for the game... I think that it has a HUGE potential.","June 29, 2015","true","5.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

You don't do any foot work but use machines such as diggers, cement pumps, cranes and other stuff and you have to deliver the materials to the site. I really like the open world element which is absent in most simulators as you select your own jobs and complete them at your own pace. The multiplayer works fine and other than a few physics and AI driving glitches the game has worked perfectly for me. If you find a job too tedious you can tell an employee to do it but it does have some downsides so it's not cheap to do so. The variety of jobs, machines, and workshop support gives you quite a bit of replayability and the DLCS add quite a bit which is nice. I reccomend watching some videos on it before buying to see if it is a game for you but I thought it was pretty good. Astragon is also behind it and they make some pretty good simulator games.","September 8, 2015","true","69.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

While it's typical of the Simulation genre coming out of Europe, it lacks the polish that you would find in the likes of Farming Simulator 2015. The models are good, and the city scapes are what I would call Legoland, but attention has been put more into the economy and vehicles, rather than the scenery - as I'm sure you would expect.\nThe controls don't lend themselves to easy use, if you are using a keyboard. I don't have a game controller, so I can't comment on the ease of use with that. There is also the slightly painful driving-around-town aspect that has the player acting more like a courier than a plant operator, but that's in single player career mode. I'm sure the game shines in multiplayer, when the large contracts start rolling in and you need an extra set of hands or two!\nAt the time of writing, I've only got 10hrs clocked up and just bought my first vehicle (cargo truck with crane), I will put more hours in for 2 reasons: 1 - I bought the Gold edition, that comes with Large tracked cranes and bridge building (cool factor right there), and 2 - it's just so darn relaxing!\n","November 16, 2015","true","11.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Which is obviously a scaled down version of this big brother. Not that I'm biased by that, It's just the reason I started playing this game.\n\nI'm gonna compare it with Euro Truck Simulator 2. I love that game, mainly because it's polish. Well, this game has that too. It's totally NOT a crappy simulator. It's probably one of the best actually. If you enjoy Euro Truck Simulator 2 mainly because it's relaxing, you''ll probably find this game relaxing too.\n\nI just had my first CO-OP experience and I really loved it! Working on the save job, both in different vehicles is really cool. I also love that you can leave your vehicle and just walk. Pretty immersive.\n\nThe reviews about bad controls are not true. I think they are pretty perfect this way. Couldn't think of a better control scheme. And you absolutely don't need a controller like another reviewer said. I have no idea what that person played, not this game, that's for sure.. lol.\n\nIf you want a relaxing simulator, grab this one. The mixed reviews were mainly because of the rough launch with bugs, those are patched so no worries about that anymore.

It will take a little bit of time invested to get use to all the movements of the equipment and some patients but the playability of the game is worthwhile.  The physics of the game are still a little tough.  Using the fork lift lifting items if not done with some grace can become frustrating to get items onto the flat bed.  Also driving the vehicles for long distances can be challenging.  Other traffic on the road is more of an annoyance than a penalty meaning there are no repercussions for driving straight into a small car at full speed other than the fact you have to get up to speed again.\n\nIf you’re a farm simulator type of fan then you’ll like this game.  The progression is good as you move through each challenge and get to start to add larger cooler equipment.  The way it’s done it keeps you playing to get that new cool new crane etc…  Overall I give this game a 7 out of 10.  Graphics are a little dated.  Physics can be wonky but over looked if you’re not an OCD sim player.  For the price and the DLCs that are coming out its worth the price and will kill off about 40 to 70 hours of your life before you move onto the next sim game.  Happy Building.\n\n","December 2, 2015","true","9.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

That said there are a few issues I've noticed. 1. The initial truck has an issue climbing the hill next to your home base when pulling the trailer even if the excavator isn't loaded on the trailer, it's much worse when the excavator is loaded, to the point that it's much easier to just drive the excavator up that hill and forgoe the trailer for that area. Secondly the trucks have a tendency to slide too easily while turning, I hope those two things can be fixed in a future patch.\nAs for the negative comments such as the one claiming that they couldn't "fasten cargo", Yes, if you pay attention to the tutorial it tells you how to do so. Part of the actual job that this game emulates is PAYING ATTENTION TO DIRECTIONS, secondly it's not that big of an issue to need to affix cargo, I used to drive trucks both flatbeds and Semi and at times didn't need to affix certain loads. If you're skilled enough even you can stack two pallets on top of one another with the forklift and load them simultaneously onto the flatbed and then strap them down. Doing this you can get a total of at least 8 pallets at one time on the flatbed.  The game is great, the gamepad controls work well, and so far other than the hill glitch I found and the trucks sliding too much when turning. * ( The hill glitch I referred to is being unable to climb the hill while pullling the excavator on the trailer, I found that I wasn't strapping the excavator in and once I did so there was no problem, so it was my fauilt and not the fault of the game. It's a going trend, almost every negative review is from people who did something wrong or didn't pay attention and don't wish to admit it.)   If you want to lose plenty hours to a game and feel satisfied doing so, get and enjoy Construction Simulator 2015.   Plus if you're like me and disabled and miss working, it can help give you the feeling of actually being able to work and that alone makes this game therapeutic and for $30 that is a bargain. Plus let's not forget the workshop, you can add in your own content as well.  Definiteily, DEFINITELY worth purchasing at $30, I would even have paid $50 or $60 for it.","January 3, 2015","true","21.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

As for the graphics they are decent but need some work on vehicle speeds. I have also noticed while playing this game that it does have quite a few glitches in it. For example the guy that tells me to back the truck up and connect the trailer doesn't go away even after starting the first task of digging with the excavator. I do like the game and I know I'm going to enjoy many hours of playing it. Would I recommend this to someone else? The answer to that is probably. I think that the only way your going to be able to experience this games full potential and not have any lag or any problems with it is if you have a computer that exceeds the recommended requirements. I have tested this game on four different machines and found that it works best on the machine I'm currently on.","March 29, 2015","true","25.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It is a very fun game as you get to play with construction equipment that you would probably never get to do IRL.  I like the cranes especially, I wish they would put a little more into the animation though.  There are counter weights that should move as you manuver a load to keep it balanced.  There are some clipping issues but they are usually more helpful then a hinderance.\n\nThe main problem I have is that its fairly intensive on my computer.  I have a AMD Penom II x6 with 16 gig ram and Radeon HD 6800 vid card plus a lot of cooling power.  When I run the game the fans start kicking up, eventually to max speeds.  The longer I play the more evident its creating a heat problem.  If i play long enough it will lock eventually due to heat.  I have turned off the NPC vehicles and pedestrians.  (The NPC vehicles are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anyhow.  They pull out in front of a loaded low boy barreling down at top speed.)  This helped the heat issues but it is still present.\n\nPros:\nCool equipment\nDifferent and larger jobs\nVariety of equipment\n\nCons:\nThose jobs get repetitve pretty quick\nComputer working harder then I like","July 29, 2015","true","127.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has been around for a few years (2014 version, and Android version) so has built on its own experience and I have to say that they have done well.\n\nThe game does have some bugs but these can be forgiven by the sheer amount of things you can do in this game. There are 15 driveable vehicles in the game and you start with 3 of these. These are a small flatbed tipper, a skip lorry and a small digger/excavator, there is also a small trailor for transport if you need it.\n\nThe idea behind the game is great, get a job, collect materials and dig foundations and then ferry materials to the site for the build. That sounds boring after a while but the missions get harder and bigger just in the nick of time.\nAdd into that the fact that you can buy new vehicles whenever you want and therefore open up new missions and you will not get bored.\n\nThere are some negatives, there are bugs, you will get stuck, some vehicles are under powered, the physics can be a little strange at times.\n\n2 DLC's later and this game is still going strong. If you want a construction sim that you will be playing until the end then do take a look at CS2015.\n\nCheck out our video playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x8Ai8D2adM&list=PLU8n7_nwpvJJJeGB7iLkhUzfAFcF0uzkx\n\nUPDATE\n\nConstruction Simulator 2015 has now become Construction Simulator 2015 Gold edition. This means that there are now multiple controllers supported and a couple of fixes. The new charity DLC allows you to build the new Hospital and more.\n\nMulti Controller Support - You can now control the game using multiple controllers. For example I use my xbox 360 controller and a G27 wheel and pedal set. Others have been able ti use 2 flight sticks to control the excavators just as you would in real life. Mix in some pedals from your flight stick and the level of imersion has just topped out!\n\nRemember to check out my gaming review group over at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/EBUKGamer\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/289950","August 24, 2015","true","50.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Excavator arms can exctract but the opposite buttons don't work even though they are assigned correctly, so i can't retract excavator arms. Objectives are unclear, telling you to unloda objects in "marked" areas, but you have no clue where, also no arrows or markers. Driving trucks has very unreliable steering on keyboard with great accaleration causing turns to be taken too big and curves on the highway to make you spin 180 degrees. No ambient music at all or anything.\nAlso, let's call this game material and machine transporting simulator. You are delivering materials for 10 minutes, then you dig for 1 minute and a building pops out of nowhere.

I recommend it to anyone who enjoys building games. I admit that at times it feels like "transport sim 2015", but it is an awesome game.

So if your looking for a good simulation game or just have some extra money lying around, you should definatly download this game and get the gold edition.

The landscape is very nice, cars react to your driving. Also the interface, for the most part is nice. That said, it lacks in many perspectives. Mainly, keeping an avid gamers attention when there are many other new games out there. I love building games in general, I just feel this falls flat. You have to transport pallets of various 'types', though they are mostly the same general shape with little variance. You dig with a somewhat buggy excavator shovel. ( you have to dig just right or you'll be sitting there all day). Also, vehicles get stuck on tiny mounds of dirt. I'm not sure how else to put it, with trucks having wheels this large, what gives? There is a very convenient reset button, backspace, which will transport you to the last road you were on. It seems the developers themselves didn't have faith in their game. You can also pour concrete, yippy. The first mission I did I couldn't even fill the whole mold because I didn't have a pumper vehicle. Hiring employees basically lets you gain money but little to no exp, and there is no watching them. It's done in the backend system. The leveling system somewhat lacks, only a handful of key levels unlock anything important. such as. another worker (yippy), another foreman to do more jobs, etc..\n\nSo that's a few sarcastic 'yippy's to only a couple hoorays. Don't buy this until it's at least on (very cheap) sale. It may be worth it at a few bucks though.","November 26, 2014","false","9.1"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

It gets better again when the larger jobs start with the larger equipment but incredibly it gets boring again soon after. The worst bugs were the ones that caused me to redo all the hard work I had done.

The graphics and detail are nice, as are the trucks themselves.  I actually have mostly good things to say about this game.  The bad things, however, are not going to help this game any.  The biggest issue is lag.  Inside the city the game lags so badly you need to turn off pedestrians and road traffic just to get decent frames, and even then it's still sketchy.  There are Youtubers with good PCs that still have performance issues.  My second issue is the digging is inconsistent.  One digging mission you may only have to dig out the surface, while another you have to dig out half of the entire thing.  I love digging and think it's fun, but when you spend a lot of time doing it because you need to transport the dirt, it gets tedious.\n\nMy final complaint is the misleading title of this game.  "Construction Simulator" sounds like you're actually a construction worker DOING the work.  Aside from the digging, crane operation, rolling, and cementing, the game is mostly errand boy simulator.  95% is driving around a flatbed haulng materials.  When you deliver the materials, the building gets built for you.  You don't actually do anything else.\n\nThis is a fun game.  I love driving around in the front loader, the roller, etc, but the intense lag and lack of actual consstruction work does't merit buying this game unless you plan to play a lot of multiplayer with friends.","June 7, 2015","false","82.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

There's a lot of potential in this game if the developer spends time testing the game and implement a lot of bug fixes.","February 20, 2015","false","65.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I feel I've given it a fair chance (6 hours'ish), but honestly I can't play it any more. Talk about some serious frustration when attempting the most menial tasks. The controls are terrible, and the physics are completely abysmal. I'll give you an example...in one of my early "jobs" my excavator controls quit working; meaning that my bucket and the left/right swivel controls locked up and wouldn’t respond to input anymore. Resetting it, didn't work. I even attempted to sell it, which I couldn't, because according to the game, "you can’t sell your starting vehicles." So, I bought another one, thinking that the new one would surely work and I could finish my job...NOPE, that one was broke too!\n\nOther examples include, my trailer got stuck IN the ground and would not reset...the forklift's fork functions move when panning the camera around, very wonky digging controls/gameplay all the way around. Honestly, about the only thing fun to do in this game is the container pickup/drop-off jobs, because they're the only ones that seem to work with no major issues.\n\nI believe there really are some good aspects of this game and the potential for a decent game is there. However, that potential has been left out of this game, which makes me wonder...why make a half-@$$ed attempt??? Why hitch your wagon to a junk game and ruin a reputation, or at least never establish a reputation as a decent development studio?? I mean with some tweaking here and there this, in my opinion, could really be a fun game.\n\nFor the sake of my criticisms, I'll add some general recommendations that, I feel, would make this game better; fix the physics, collision boxes & clipping, fix the bugs that affects the playability/movement of the machines, and definitely work to improve those control and camera/view schemes.\n\nNot recommended -8 out of +10, for all of the above issues!\n\n**If the game gets better and things improve, I may change my review. Of course, that's assuming I decide to give up any more time to this piece instead of playing better quality games.","January 3, 2015","false","6.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I managed to get it to work after turning the resolution down and all of the settings down but it really wasn't worth it. The game is unfinished and broken/buggy and really isn't that fun when it is working. Multiplayer had potential but instead of working on tasks together, you are forced to either wait for the other player to finish part of a job, or look for your own. I really just can't reccomend this game in it's current state. The bugs and glitches are still there on my friend's gtx770, so it is not just an AMD issue. Please, people, releasing unfinished games is becoming a common trend today, and it should not be a practice that you support. This game needs to be considered early access or a beta as that is essentially what it is.

O! I just checked and this simulator is actually Construction Simulator 2015! Who knew?!\n\nThis is my opinion of Construction Simulator 2015                                                                                                                                                AspectRatingRealism4.5Graphics6.5Sound6.5Gameplay4.5Overall5.5Scores are out of 10. Overall score is an average\n\nI was looking forward to playing Construction Simulator 2015 when I first saw it. It has an interesting concept; transport, excavate, construct. With over 200 missions, an array of vehicles at your disposal, and a massive open world, how could this game get boring? Well, first off the game has you doing the same menial tasks over and over again to pad out the gameplay hours. The other problem is that there are only 15 vehicles, so once you have them all, the feeling of progression ends as you just rack up millions of dollars while doing the same tasks over and over. The other problem is the amount of bugs, glitches and minor errors. I kept getting the feeling that game is unfinished. Throughout my gameplay time I came across a multitude of bugs, errors and just small details that could have been fixed.\n\nOverall: I DO NOT recommend Construction Simulator 2015. If you really would like to play it, I would recommend you wait until its at least 80% off.\n","November 16, 2015","false","25.5"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","14","1","7","0","0"

It's essentially a glorified delivery game.  You pick a contract (from four options), go the Home Depot essentially, spend 30 minutes loading your truck, drive to the site fighting lag - bouncing vehicles - terrible navigation - etc., spend 15 minutes unloading the supplies into a square, and go back to the materials dealer.\n\nWhen you do get something a bit more challenging, it doesn't work.  Example:  Dig a hole (almost impossible by the way), place the dirt in your brand new shiny red dump truck, drive the truck...oh wait...you can't get dirt in the truck because everytime your bucket gets close to it, it flips over and dumps the dirt everywhere.\n\nDon't buy this game!

Let me tell you why.\nDon't get me wrong, this is a nice game, but it only works if you have an XBOX controller.\n\n--------------------------\nPROS:\n\n+ Good range of vehicles, from small trucks to huge cranes\n+ DLC's aren't expensive and adds some nice vehicles\n+ Missions are ok.\n+ Aside from the regular missions, you will have the chance to get special ones.\n+ You can see your little company grow up by buying more places to store your vehicles.\n+ The level system isn't grindy.\n+ Multiplayer!\n+ Support Steam Workshop (which means more vehicles and stuff)\n+ You can employ NPCs to do the hard job for you, if you want (but you can't see them working)\n\nCONS:\n\n- It seems this game was not designed for PC. The mouse and keyboard controls are awful. If you think the machines controls are like farming simulator, you are wrong!\n\n- The camera. OMFG, THE CAMERA CONTROL SUCKS! You can't control the camera on the xbox controller, you have to do it on the mouse, because who the hell knows why? Why can't this game have a nice camera control like every other game out there?\n\n- If you are playing on mouse and keyboard, you will have to keep pressing the right mouse button to turn the camera around. This sucks!\n\n- There are a few bugs. Not a big deal, but it's annoying as ♥♥♥♥ (the truck with the crane, for example. Sometimes the crane stuck on the truck itself and dont move).\n\n- You dont get to build anything. All you do is place things with the crane, dig holes with an excavator, and transport stuff from A to B. But it's quite fun.\n\n----------------------\n\nSo basically is this. If you have an XBOX controller, go ahead, it'll be fun!\nBut if you dont, you better buy one before you get this game :)","February 16","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

But if you are the patient-builder type, then this would be a pretty interesting game. It's not overly exciting or super engaging, however, it can be an great addicting time waster. The vehicles are very detailed, the mechanics and moving parts are pretty awesome and the graphics are pretty neat too. You can adjust the driving sensitivity and basically the physics of driving with or without a payload. Various types of machinery and building products to buy and use. However, bumping into stuff can be annoying; you come to a dead stop, even as much as a stop sign. The "free camera & follow camera" options is a little quirky, can be irritating readjusting angles but not a buzzkiller. Overall it's worth giving a shot if you're an extremely patient gamer and like projects; it does take time to get comfortable with the controls and understand how the projects work. The only down side is the time it takes traveling back and forth from one location to another. But in less then a week I'm putting in a lot of time. Just don't get your hopes to high, it's definitely not a 9/10 but definitey not lower then a 5.","February 25","true","37.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like Farming Simulator this is a vehicle-based where driving big machines is the thing.  In Construction Simulator, however, the wolrd is bigger, better and offers more things to do.  In the beginning you'll spend most of your time collecting and delivering building materials and not, apparently, doing much construction (which happens automatically as you deliver the required materials).  As you buy more vehicles you spend more time on building-related work on bigger - and more lucrative - projects.  Be warned; some of the vehicles have a lot of controls and it can take a bit of practice to use them smoothly.\n\nExample early mission: deliver 2 pallets of bricks - involves driving a truck to the supplier, loading truck with forklift, driving to construction site, unloading truck with ... oh, you'll need to bring your excavator if you don't have a crane.  So that needs to be loaded on a trailer and towed to the site too.  Or you can miss the point completely and drive a forklift slowly all over the map.\n\nExample late mission: build a block of flats - briefly involves taking a roller to the site to prepare the ground, lifting pipes and materials into position with a tower crane, drilling holes for foundations, getting concrete from the quarry, pouring concrete foundations, getting pre-fabricated walls from the factory, lifting them into place, pouring more concrete, delivering more supplies, lifting lots more stuff, digging holes, taking spoil back to the quarry and landscaping with some plants from the nursery.  There are quite a few other places you might have to visit too.\n\nTraffic AI is not bad, but with 'very high' number of cars around expect to get caught-up in traffic jams quite a lot.  There are also a couple of issues with the physics in that a) a lot of vehicles seem to have almost no traction, b) excavating is fairly restricted.  Neither of these is a game-breaker if you like these types of games.","May 21","true","58.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Already have way more money than I can ever use, have all implements, and have doubles of several things.\n\nGame is cool if you like construction or operating big machinery (tower crane, mobile crane, cement pump). Map is a decent size, it can take a few minutes to drive across the entire city.\n\nProblems though, driving or operating a digger is goofy, controls are pretty wonky and backwards to what you'd expect them to be. Many times I'm pressing 4 buttons at the same time just to get things set up or trying to get them to work smoothly. Physics are not quite right, on a slight hill my trailer slides around and my implements fall off trailers. If you hit a stop sign or other sign you can stop immediately, go flying, send the sign flying, sometimes all of the above. I can have 2 jobs going at the same time but can only warp to 1 of the job sites, the other I have to drive to. The waypoint on the map changes if you click the 2nd job (even just to send a worker there).\n\nAnd then the punishing of thinking ahead. I will go through the list of items I will need in future steps of a job, and put them all on a trailer. Once part of a job is done my trailer will spawn back at my base, as will all the items I spent a bunch of time on to get on the trailer.\n\nLooking back, I wish I had saved my $15.","May 30","false","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also there are still problem with bugs and other stuff. It is only for people who really likes this type of simulation, in this only case i recommend the game otherwise don't buy it !","July 25, 2015","false","160.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First the small excavator u should make it so u can use the plow on the front. Second the large excavator u should be able to use the plow on the front. Third there should be a bulldozer so when there is too much dirt u can move it easily it would be so helpful. 4th there should be a backhoe but make it pricey with no DLC. There also should be bobcats and skidsteers. You should add in road jobs but make the package a DLC and cost around $10.00 and have it include special dump trucks, road signs and a road sign truck, pavers, road sweepers, and a road stripper that way u can rip up the broken road and put in a new one. PLZ TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION IF U SEE THIS CREATORS OF CONSTRUCTION SIMULATOR 2015!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","June 4","true","77.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
