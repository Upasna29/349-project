Actually, there are quite a few Popcap games that are pretty much just pure HO scenes with little to no story. Such is Escape Rosecliff Island but I prefer this game over all the rest. I've played this a few times. I didn't REALLY need to buy it on Steam but I wanted it with my "steam HO set" and also wanted an excuse to play it again. I wouldn't say there's anything remarkable about the game. There's no story other than "escape the island". There's no scare factor - you're just searching for items that will help you leave. There's not much music to speak of. The game is just many HO scenes with puzzles here and there (jigsaw, memory tiles, match 3, and word search). There are 25 scenes that you repeatedly visit but there are so many items in each, you're always looking for something different. Find 50 locks in those 25 areas and you open up 2 Bonus Games. One is Unlimited Match 3 and the other is Unlimited Hidden Objects. Just as in The Lost Tomb, you can clear each hidden object scene completely (when you find an item, the word is crossed off and another pops up in its place). So afterwards, you're left with a thoroughly bare room. It's an extremely fun thing to do! No, this game is not for everyone. You need to be an HO fan and be in an HO mood. If you are, I definitely recommend this game.","September 18, 2015","true","8.3"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","22","22","0","1"

You don't get to explore an island, pick up tools along the way, find hidden object scenes and solve puzzles to advance like a lot of the popular hidden object games. You just pick a scene, find some objects, go to the next one, find some objects. Every once in a while, you break up the endless monotony with an extremely simple puzzle; such as, matching cards and word searches. After finishing the end-level puzzle (word search, match-3, etc.) you receive a tool to help you escape the island.\n\nI tried to push through, until I realized that you start revisiting scenes. After that, I just couldn't take anymore.\n\nMaybe, I skipped a cut scene? All I know is that I have no idea why I was on the island. The puzzles are flat and boring and I have no hope that the ending would do this game any justice.","July 8, 2014","false","1.1"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","0"

I just want to say first this one was a tough decision. I haven't quite beaten the game at the time of this writing and I do plan to, but I know how it ends already and some key flaws here force me to say buy this in a bundle or on sale only. Good Features- Good ambient music, not distracting or annoying despite the fact it repeats over and over. The enviroments are fine. The "unlimited seek and find" mode is enjoyable to me, simply because after playing this game for a while the massive lutter in each scenario is a little infuriating. The bad-The hint system picks an object you have to find from your remaining object rather than allowing you to choose an object to use it on. The "bonus game" is surprisingly stupid. All it is is 15 levels of the crappy 'match three' game that popcap already did mutch better in bejeweled, this minigame was already a weak point in this game and to give it 15 levels on its own seems like a bad decision especially given other minigames are much more fun. Finally , this game's biggest problem is the fact that it reuses each scenario over and over needlessly. I expected this game to end at level 15. It ended at level 20. There is no reason the main "campaign" mode of this game had to be dragged out that long. For that reason, I don't recommend it. 4/10","March 10, 2014","false","6.0"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

Not even for the price of 5 dollars.\n\nApparently the plot states that you have been shipwrecked on Rosecliff Island, and your task is to collect items to help you escape. There is no explanation as to who the previous resident(s) of the island were, or why the island is now deserted. There is no dialogue with NPCs, no narration, nothing. The gameplay consists of you bouncing from one hidden object scene to the next, and as you finish a "level," you complete a simple "puzzle" game such as a word search or matching tiles. Upon completion of the puzzle games, you are rewarded an item to assist in your escape, such as a bucket or a stack of wood. As you progress along, you begin to see the same hidden object scenes again... and again... and again. As much as I enjoy hidden object games, even I found myself overwhelmed with mind-numbing boredom.\n\nOn the plus side, the artwork is nice, with the hidden object scenes not being overly cluttered, and the items were often cleverly hidden.\n\nVerdict: Don't spend 5 dollars for this game unless you happen to enjoy visiting the same hidden object scenes over and over. If so, buy it if it is on sale for 90 percent off.","November 22, 2014","false","19.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

One day I woke up and logged into Steam and there was a steaming pile of free game so thank you Steam for being cool. Now this review is based on the game being free, let me make this very clear - I would not pay $5 for this game. I would pay $2 or less for this game. It's not worthless but yeah.... not worth $5.\n\nThat all being said, here is my review:\n\nYou find the missing objects before the time runs out. Some objects are really fun and occassionally you get more cryptic clues like 'Gegs' means you must find scrambled eggs in the picture. The actual pictures are quite creative and I can appreciate that a lot of effort went into drawing everything and putting it together. There is a storyline which quite frankly you stop caring about 30 seconds in. This is something I would recommend to casual gamers. I found myself playing this game when I felt frustrated with other games and wanted to just chill for 30 minutes. So I recommend this game only if you're a casual gamer and it costs $2 or less. Ultimately this game serves its purpose of being a find the hidden object game. It's nothing more and nothing less.\n\n5.5/10","March 27, 2015","true","13.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's a hidden object game and, like most of the type, the graphics level is such that it can be very hard to distinguish the objects from the background. Also, there are various (generally very simple) mini-games involved in order to collect escape objects and such. The scenes are repetitive, there is really no real storyline, and most of the searching turns out to be unnecessary given the tools needed to actually escape, so it's definitely flawed in a lot of ways. Yet, there is a level of fun to it, when you just want a relaxing casual game to pass the time with.","December 19, 2014","true","17.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There's 25 levels, and on average, you'll have to go through 4 or 5 different places to look for objects.\n\nOne small highlight, however, was the finding of all 50 locks, which would then permit to play the bonus games, as well as looking for all the objects in every of the 25 pictures. With well over 2000 objects to find, it will definitely take some time - and I took this time to find all of them without taking hints.\n\nStill, I wouldn't really recommend this game, unless you have great patience and tolerance for redundant gameplay and repetitive actions. I purchased this game in a bundle of Popcap games, which in my opinion is the only way you should get a hold of a copy of this game.","January 11, 2015","false","11.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This is only the second one I've played.  Anyway, the number one reason why I'm not recommending this is the ridiculous amount of repetition.  Each of the 25 puzzle locations has in the neighborhood of 50-70 hidden objects in them.  In the main mode, you visit each of them by level 15 but then are forced to play 10 more levels (of multiple locations each) to get to the end.  I think the justification for the repetition is that you search for 10 objects at a time per location but since the objects are also repeated across locations it just feels even more repetitious.  Secondly, the threadbare "story."  Each level, after searching several locations on the island, you collect an item to help you get to the end of the game. SPOILER  However, you get to the end of the game after collecting 25 escape objects to be told you only need 9 of them :( All that repetition for nothing.   Other that that, after each level you get to do a simple game mode like card matching, match 3, word search, or some jigsaw type ones.  These are just ok.  You can unlock a mode where you get to do 15 levels of match three, but that was the least fun type.  Now on the plus side, the hidden objects are well placed within the locations and there was some fun word play in the clues sometimes.  Also, I did enjoy the simple final escape puzzle.  I was surprised to find that I really enjoyed the Unlimited Seek and Find mode that you can unlock.  Contrary to what I expected in this mode, you get to find every available item at a location (which like I said seemed to be in the 50-70 item range.)  I played through the game twice because I knew I wanted to write a review, but otherwise I only would have played through it once.   BOTTOM LINE: For half the price, Season of Mystery: The Cherry Blossom Murders is a better hidden object game buy.  It has an actual story and less repetition and Steam achievements.  However, if you're going by game time alone, Escape from Rosecliff Island forces you to spend much more time on it.","April 29, 2014","false","14.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I would probably try to find an escape route as fast as possible, because you never know the "abandoned" part, right?\n\nGraphics: Ø The game offers no real surprises, graphically. At least the producer and devs made the game compatible to higher resolutions. The graphics are still a bit outdated, but it doesn't hinder gameplay.\n\nSound: Ø Atmospheric and fitting. But you would expect a bit more.\n\nPlayability: Ø The game is slightly off towards playability, yes it has riddles - or more aptly minigames, yes it has good Scenes. But it's also very cluttered. Nonetheless, some searchable objects are described as riddles, which actually is fun. It still is a clickfest game, but more on the good side of the term.\n\nGenre Type Scoring:\n\nStory: Ø Not much of a story to tell, you have to escape an Island on which you have stranded. At least the game doesn't make false pretensions and trying to offer some nutty or weird explanations.\n\nTechnical Realisation: + Actually this game is solidly programmed and is portable into higher resolutions without a lot of fuss and blurr. The sound was alright during game, no crunch, stopping or other problems.\n\nExtras: + Oh? This game really has two game modes which the user may unlock by finding "locks". For a game of that age it's not as common, and yes it suffices to give it a slight plus.\n\nOverall: 2+ The game has only a slight positive rating in my opinion, it is quite standard fare, nothing that surprises, but als nothing that is giving too much of a unpleasant surprise. Sadly the game also isn't very memorable, so after playing and solving it you might already have forgotten what the game was about... Hmmmm, or is it just me getting old and losing my faculties?\n\nValue for Money: Ø Mediochre 4,99 There are a lot of games, that migh have the same price tag, but are far more of a game than this, given it has some extras. It's just not memorable enough to buy it at this price.\n\nConditional Recommendation\nThis is a game for nostalgics of the genre, and of course for fans of hidden object games. Newbies to the genre should look for other, more recent games, which actually add a lot of story, and artsy design. The lack of memorable features is what actually was anoying me... it's like... washing the dishes.","April 15","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each object has some 70+ objects hidden, so there is little overlap, but you do start recognizing the objects, which speeds up your search; later "levels" seem easier. It is vexing that the clue for a magnet was "positive and negative", and the clues mis-identify trowels as "spades", but other than those glitches, the game was a decent member of the genre, and occupied a  bit more than six hours of game play.

It has some nice features, like mini-games after every 'set' of searches, and well disguised items, but after the first half hour, everything else is nothing but repetition. There are 8-or-something levels, which you will be playing over and over again, for hours. Yes the items you need to get are different, but the scene and what you're doing is not. Great in the short-term, but when the game asks you for 6-something hours to complete it? There isn't enough patience in the world.

But, I find that the game is very calming and almost requires you to concentrate to find the hidden items or you lose precious time. Definitely a game for casual players like myself but can also be played in long sessions because it's addicting as heck.","May 23","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Honestlly, the best part of this game was when it was over.
