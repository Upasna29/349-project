Europe had turned into a desert thanks to the global warming, America had conquered the entire Western Hemisphere, Egypt - all of Africa.\n\nOur militaries had become so large, so advanced, and the nuclear wars so constant that we eventually found ourselves in a deadlock - slowly starving, rotting away with the time. Our capitals had long been wiped away - eventually, wars were no longer profitable, the resources had run out.\n\nI played that game until the CD had finally quit on me, determined to see the end of the world. Compared to today, it may not be as flashy anymore - but Civilization III is the best of the series, Civilization IV comes at a close second, but things were removed and added in the later installments that made one feel like they had lost  a bit of the original game.

This game has.. it.. it means so very much to me. I still have the original deluxe box set from 2001. This game has taught me about history, military command, creativity, humbleness, frustration and so much more. I cannot begin to imagine the true hours I have off of steam. Over a thousand, surely by now.\n\nThis game brought me and my new stepfather together almost 15 years ago. This game shaped my brain and how I see the world and history. I have made and submitted maps to the Civfanatics forums, contributed to full overhaul mods, and spent countless hours making faithful recreations of real geography in the glorious editor. All the Civilization games that came after pale in comparison.\n\nThis game was probably more of a parent and guide than my parents. Taught me about cooperation and systematic destruction of the god forsaken Aztecs.\n\nA true 10/10, if you have the time to sit down for a 16 hour slugfest on Sid difficulty. From the music to the graphics to the civilopedia to all the content out there made lovingly by loving fans, this game has captivated me like no other in my entire life. The online community might be a little lacking these days, but the AI, in my opinion, does just fine. I cannot express enough how thoroughly I have and still do enjoy this game.\n\nFrom humble beginnings, this game has risen to stand the test of time. I will play it until the very day that I die.

Why play it now, when Civ V is tuned, fixed, updated so many times - and even price looks fine for almost every pocket? Well, it's all for that focus I'm talking about.\n\nFirst three of Civilization games were taking the player back at the dawn of the known history - and to help to notice the flow of time, there was some borderlines across that mighty river of the so-called "4th dimension". Starting with the Civ IV this process of moving through timeline were "smoothed", to the point where player gliding from the start to the end of the game without any noticable delay. I'm not saying that's bad - I like Civ V myself - but sometimes you don't want simple transfer from A to B, from the stone to electric age - you want to see cornerstones of each specific era. And with that - Civ III is giving you the better experience.\n\nAll that I said in the previous passage, is arguable, of course. But here is another trait of Civ III which was intentionally cutted off (in favor of balance, of course): the size of armies and all warfare business.\nWith all complexity of the game mechanics in the Civ V, armed conquests there looking as they performed by 10-20 people at best. In Civ III, we have totally another scale. So, when I want to win a game of Civilization by assault strategy, I start Civ III.\n\nThe third volume of Civilization is dated, but still deep, still challenging, still holding the billion of possibilities to build your Nation. Make Your Way. So I'll mark the game as 9/10 - not ideal, but so much enjoyable.","May 3","true","49.6"," 55 of 58 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","55","58","4","7"

This is another one of those titles that you might have grown up with as a kid and have had nostalgic value to you. This is at least the case for me. I remember that the game took a chocking 700 MB of space on my hard disk and it was generally tanking my late 90's computer. I have sunk a huge amount of hours into this game and for me this is the best game in the series.\n\nCivilization is probably the most dominating Turn-based strategy game in the gaming industry. The Total Wars games for example are RTS/TBS hybrids, while CIV is completely TBS. True Civilization enthusiasts probably rank Civ3 pretty low, compared to Civ2, Civ4 and Civ5 which were very well received for their times. For me however, Civilization 3 is the favorite among the ones I've played (Civ3, Civ4 and Civ5). Again - because of it's nostalgic value.\n\nAll Civ games start out the same way unless you play a scenario or campaign. You start off with a settler and a warrior of some sorts. The settler can build a city, and as you find a suitable location for your capital - let your Civilization begin! Beware though, once you have started a game you won't be able to leave for at least 4 hours. This game is honestly best played during the night and is mostly a single-player experience.\n\nThere is a Campaign/Scenario mode, where you play historical events or just silly settings. As well as a multiplayer mode, but I have never enjoyed these ones at all. Nothing beats that random map mode, select the terrain, the climate, map size and your opponents/allies. Let the history get rewritten as you choose the path of the righteous, or the path of the tyrant. Through exploding expansion, racing technology, crushing warfare and cunning diplomacy you must stand victor as the one and only dominating superpower.\n\nI only recommend picking this up if you have a personal connection to it, or if you are entirely out of gameplay from modern titles.\n\nNote: You might want to check out Civilization V (Review) as it's a modern take to the genre and series.","June 30, 2013","true","61.0"," 54 of 59 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","54","59","0","0"

However, I still enjoyed this game a lot. I'm awful, I lose pretty much every time, and I still have fun. This game has you building a civilization from scratch, trying to expand city by city to become the best civilization possible. At the start, you are given TONS of options. Picking what civilization you want to be to determine your starting perks, climate, weather, the age of the world, difficulty, barbarian options, AI agreesiveness, the ratio of water to land, and a whole bunch of customizable options for the rules and game limits. It's a lot to take in. And once you start, you can work towards whatever kind of civilization you want, from city structures to your units to your research... there's just a lot of options. But, what makes this game so cool is that there are not only a lot of options for starting and working your way through the game, there are also multiple ways to win the game as well. So you can replay lots of times trying to win in all the different ways available. If you are being severely outmatched in one area by another civilization, perhaps you can salvage your game by switching to another goal for victory. It's really very clever.\n\nHowever, there ARE some issues with this game. It can be a lot to take in at first, especially since the tutorial mode is defaulted to off. I learned everything by winging it but not everyone will have the patience or luck for it. It'll take a while just to get used to what everything does and understanding how to navigate the game. Also, games tend to take hours to complete, which can also be rough if you don't have much time to play. It'll take A LOT of time to get acquainted with the game and to play in general so it's a HUGE time suck. I just wanted to get that point clearly across. Also... it's really hard... or I just suck... or both. Also... the online has been shut down, making this single player only. There ARE some complicated and iffy ways of working around it to play online, but they aren't worth the risk or hassle. The online is supposedly coming to Steamworks in the future, but until it comes, online is not a viable options, which is the whole reason I got it in the first place and that's diappointing, but it's my own fault for not looking into it more I guess.\n\nDespite the issues, this game is VERY cheap. Five bucks for hours and hours of gameplay, including the two expansions to the game. Easily worth it, especially if you're looking to get into the Civilization series or TBS game in general. Just be aware of the time it will take to enjoy the game.","November 6, 2014","true","55.0"," 44 of 48 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","44","48","5","11"

The player starts off in the year 4000 BC with a small group of settlers and some basic knowledge of road building, irrigation & farming. After choosing the site of their first City the player then has to explore and expand their empire to other locations. The ideal placement of a City would be close to natural resources & luxuries, this will help increase trade, production & happiness of the citizens. Connecting City's via roads also increases trade and the sharing of resources / luxuries across your empire. During the early game roaming Barbarians may cause problems along your borders and any unprotected units or land will be either captured or pillaged. As you progress through the centuries you will eventually meet other Civilizations. Some of these will be friendly and willing to trade, others more hostile and may attack you completely unprovoked. You have the opportunity to influence the opinions of other empires by your actions towards them, giving them gifts or trading technology is usually a way to get on their good side. Later in the game you can also forge an alliance with certain empires in the form of a mutual protection pact. This is especially useful during times of War to help seal victory over your enemies. The game ends in one of six ways, the most traditional being conquest (destroying all opponents). The Space race victory occurs when any Civilization completes and launches a Space Ship to Alpha Centauri. Other victory types are Cultural, Diplomatic & Domination. If the game ends and no one is victorious by any of these, the game uses a "histograph" to determine the winner by points.\n\nThis is one of my all time favourite games, though Civ IV has more depth by adding religion, unit promotions and other special abilities. I still prefer this version to any other.\n\nThere are no in game options for changing to widescreen resolutions but if you do the following: goto your Steam/SteamApps/Common/Sid Meier's Civilization III Complete/Conquests folder then find the file called conquests.ini. Right click to edit the file then goto the bottom and add the line Keepres=1 this will force the game to your monitors resolution.","July 28, 2013","true","83.3"," 41 of 46 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","41","46","0","0"

Online multiplayer? You bet!  Unique mechanics and smart AI for it's age? Yup! Good graphics for a game made in 2001? Heck yes!  The replay value of this game makes even Civ 5 blush.  I've been playing this game since 2006, and I still never get bored of it.  Every scenario pans out differently, and no two games are ever quite the same.  Even to this day, I prefer this over Civ 5.

After this entry the focus became less on society building simulation and more on micromanging increasingly Byzantine (pun intended) resources and minmaxing to hit various win conditions. Civ III is the last one you can really just chill and play however you like without regards to whether you win or lose and still have fun with. Complete is required, the vanilla Civ III had tons of balance issues.\n\nI also like how in III the civilizations have a hint of individual flavor without being locked into an identity. After this game the wrong combination of civilization and starting position could be really killer, in this game it just means you don't have as much of an edge. There are some unique units that can be really game changing depending on the situation you are in when you hit them, but ultimately it's still very situational. I recommend playing around Monarch level for a good mix of challenge and relaxation, below this level enemy civs don't develop enough to make decent trading partners, above it they start with such an advantage you're scrambling to play catch up until late in the game.\n\nFor fans of old school civ, this is the game you want.\n\n(Note I probably have played several hundred hours of this game, but mostly before Steam even existed).","June 24, 2014","true","21.3"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"

Ugh, what a relief! This is my favorite installment of the Civ series. The game has a slew of nice preferences to choose from, even including an aid for the color blind.\n\nCONS:  New to the game? Go into the options and turn the tutorial on. It's starts as off, for some reason. The cutscenes look horrible because of age and stretching. Resolutions are rough. Compared to modern installments, the opponent civs act rather erratically, to the point of being nonsensical. There is no balancing, so some Civs are OP and others you would ideally never play.\n\nWORTH: This is my favorite installment of the series, of course I think it's worth full-price. You may want to consider a discount though, if you're used to later installments. To the average player that lacks nostalgia, this is just the game you know and love but with less features.\n\nOVERALL:  It's very easy to lose track of time with this game. It's great fun and I'd recommend it to anybody looking for a good "board game" style game on Steam, since there aren't many. It's certainly more simple than four or five, but has been my favorite installment of the series.\n\nSCORE:9/10","June 9, 2015","true","26.7"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","20","21","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisisawarcrime/recommended/3910/","thisisawarcrime","Mr.WarCrimes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisisawarcrime/","85 products in account","I will start this review in two seperate forms, one for interested newcomers and then the Old Guard.\n\nI will list off the pros first before the cons of this game, Civilization 3 is a different twist of the game than you may be familar with 4 and 5. Go in understanding this switch:\n-Its an old game, if you can run the actual game, there should be no real issues.\n-Graphically, it's a sound experience and not many real issues, the modding community can find you bug fixes or new skins. Its pleasing regardless and you won't really be let down by this game.\n-Combat is similar to Civ 4, simple dice combat where units have health bars going between 3-6, strength and defense stats play their parts and very simple to understand. There are Offensive Units, Defensive Units and Manovuer units, no exceptions and combat is based on these theorectical roles.\n-31 Civs that each have 1 unique unit, unless mods are involved. Civ bonuses are general in that they have two traits which give them bonuses which are shared by others, Militaristic, Religious, Industrists, etc.\n-Diplomacy is sound and reliable, techs can be traded directly as well as maps, I will faults soon\n-Happiness is based per city, with simple factors involved including conscription\n-Civfanatics Community and its modding community are lovely and its still alive and well, just no Workshop\n\nThe Cons:\n-Civ 5 has a prediction based combat, units do no die with one attack on even matches. Not the case for this game, they fight till they die unless they are manovuer units against inf. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t can and will happen, don't cry.\n-The AI Diplomacy is very defensive and almost always cautious, wary or spiteful towards you, no exceptions.\n-Its really easy to find yourself fighting half the world because of one war, tech trading is enabled so you can find yourself backwater as they maintain amiable relations and trade those tech with one another while they fight you.\n-Multiplayer is old, the members are not exactly nub-friendly, I myself was 3 years old when this game came out.\n-Game doesn't work for you, you're ♥♥♥♥ed, not much anyone can do for you.\n-In my opinion, the hardest Civilization I have every played, it will humble you many times over.\nIn the end it is a Civ-game, you can't really go wrong with trying. It is the game that personally got me into Civilization and its unique-ness will likely find you some memorable gameplay. Hey and if you get the game and love it, I'd always be willing to play with you by e-mail or I might even try GameRanger. Good luck on your adventure To Stand The Test of Time\n\nReturning Civ 3, should you get it on steam? Yes and no, while digital copies are nice, its not any different from the disk. That being said, I prefer it on Steam. I have purchased this game three times, one the authentic Civ III Gold Version, which was outstanding and I loved it. However, eventually I got a new computer and it turns out the disc was ruined. I got the game a third time over E-bay, the only source I could find which remains, this time the Complete. Features were missing and I couldn't even access them no matter what I tried, the conquest files corrupted and Play the World missing. I got a new computer, my current, running Windows 8.1, 4GB RAM and Integrated Graphics. The disc would not load the game, but viola, I found the steam version was the cheapest to begin with. Its the same game as you know, and for me everything was working well. Underneath I will discuss the major steam issues:\n-For me at least, Steam Overlay does not appear to work and I wouldn't know how to fix it, it could be a personal issue, I don't know.\n-There are serious issues people have with getting this dinosaur game to work on new computers. Win 7 tends to have more compatiability issues with the game than Win 8(.1). Your at risk here, but this is usually the cheapest alternative\n-Modding is simple but remember, access the files through the properties tab by right-click the game in the Library Tab\n-Multiplayer is not run by Steam servers, nor GameSpy Arcade, it shut down if you haven't followed the game. It is now accessible over GameRanger. I do not know how that works or even attempted to access multiplayer.","January 12, 2015","true","171.2"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

It's always different and interesting to see how the enemy will attack you and what it takes to defend yourself/territory.  Taking over the world is my favorite, but may take days.  If you blow it then just start a whole different one.  It's easy to understand and learn but very complicated to master.  It's right up there with Chess and Axis and Allies in my book of classics.

Some of the great ideas from Alpha Centauri has been brought over creating a much more versatile playing field with a living map and more unique factions but many of Alpha Centauri's greatest assets, such as the ability to build your own units and terrain elevations are notably absent. and others, such as unique factions, are only half implemented.\n\nThese improvements however do still manage to increase the interactivity of the game substantially particularly when combined with the many new features, such as culture, that Civ III brings to the table.\n\nFactions are not longer defined simply by their city names but now have a few unique units of little consequence and civilization traits of great consequence. Unique units are simply beefed up versions of regular units that give a faction a small military advantage during the time period in which the unit is present, this can be a nice boost if you happen to go to war in that time but it can also be ignored completely if the time for war is not right. The traits each faction receives now however are of a much greater importance and can range from getting a free technology every age to a half off cost on religious buildings. These traits are big enough in effect that they tend to define your entire game.\n\nA new and important feature in Civ III is culture. Each city generates culture through it's various buildings and the culture in turn defines the size of it's borders. A heavily cultured city can even envelop the city of an opponent and flip it to your side. While the realism or historical accuracy of such a device is laughable at best it does provide players with a new means of expansion and a way to deal with those pesky resource stealing late game cities that the AI is so fond of placing in whatever unoccupied corner of your empire it can find.\n\nGraphically Civilization III is passable as always, the city view is pleasant but the rest of the game gives only a mediocre visual experience. Nothing pretty but nothing that'll ruin your gaming experience either. The soundtrack is still mostly orchestral epics and works very well although the rest of the sound effects in the game are pretty forgettable.\n\nAll in all Sid Meier's Civilization III is a good sequel. It doesn't create quite the same feeling of amazement and enjoyment that going from Civ I to Civ II does but it manages to provide a good solid experience with enough innovation to justify the purchase.","June 5, 2013","true","282.0"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

The game is definetly recomented from my part.\n\nI had to lower the screen resolution to avoid the 'tiny-litle-units' making my ayes go into pain. :-) But after all these years, I really enjoyed again the struggle to build a sivilization. There are newer versions of the same game nowdays. But I really believe that each of the Civilization games has its unique satisfaction to offer the strategy gamer, even if Civ IV is my prefered one.\n\nI definetly recoment CIV III, especially moded with mods like "Rise And Rule", which add many new units, technologies etc.  The problem is, I can not clearly identify what is this 'different gameplay aspects' that kept me playing CIV II all these hous and not starting a CIV IV or CIV V campain... The differenses on units, wonders, railway inprovements etc, should not be enouph to get me playing a game as old as this one... On the other hand, I got myself missing the real-movie councelors of CIV-II, but I don't think I will play that old love again :-)\n\nIn any case. Considering the very low price that you can purchse this old game (Civilization III), especially in a bountle together with the newet versions, I definetly believe that any gamer that likes turn -base build-expand strategies should give it a try. Even for the shenarios of the 'complete' edition, a CIV-V fun could find in CIV-III a way to further expand his Civilization gamepleasure.\n\nHave a good game everyone :-)","December 4, 2014","true","251.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","10","10","5","0"

The fashion progression for world leaders and the population.  (Nineteenth Century attire looks good on everybody; I don't know why).  Single figure unit graphics.  And extremely good graphics for the system requirements.\nAnd the world is massive.  Civ 5, by giving every unit at least 2mp, really shrank the world.\nUnits simply gain more hits points on promotion; no decision on how to specialize.\nMusic that expresses the time frame of the turn.

I had bought Civ III previously off of steam- then I hoped that buying it off steam I could find other civ III fanatics who I could play with online. Unfortunately, it was difficult to find one. There are some things in Civ III that compare better than do civ II, III, IV, and V. Civ III has no cheating console- so you can't exatly put warriors all over the map and destroy everyone before they found their first city. This forces the player to actually play the game- it took me a little while to get used to it, about an hour or so, but eventually it got better, and I got used to the fact that I couldn't cheat and I actually had to play a fair game. This game tought me that cheating is less fun than is actually playing the game.

There are a few things here and there that I think could have been expanded on- such as plague- and the fact that some civilizations simply have uninspired Unique Units with bland mechanics.

I remember pleading to my father as a child to give up his computer for a few hours so that i could make the Roman Tanks slaughter Aztec pikemen. I must have had four to five hundred hours into that game. Now, i am 14, have my own computer, and the disk seems to not support Windows 10. I went to Humble Bundle and got this for $1.25 and it works almost perfectly. I did have a crash for a custom game, and when i finished a nine hour game at the congradulations screen it crashed, BUT it plays just fine all the rest. One of the best parts of this game is the World War 2 built in mod. It is really well done. If you have played any of the newer Civilization games and you want to see the earlier titles, go for this one. In my opinion Civ 3 is the best Civ game in the series, followed closely by Civ 4","November 22, 2015","true","10.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","2"

The game can seem a little overwhelming for a new comer, but once learned can be played easily. It certainly brings me back.\nThe combat system can cause problems. It’s based of attack and defense, so occasionally a unit with a weak defense will defeat a unit with a strong attack (spearman vs. tank and wins!).\nOverall a great game!

The concept is simple: Pick your civ, play through history, win... But the execution is VERY complex. You win in different ways depending on which country you are and which does what. If you try to dominate the world as a civ that specializes in researching technology, Well you're gonna have a bad time. You could be doing amazing for a few hours and a few hundred turns into the game, but make one bad decision or one bad move and you could cripple your empire. This game has hours among hours of replayability and content, and it's relatively cheap. If you get it on sale it's dirt cheap. And I personaly think this Civ is a little easier to pick up and learn then Civ 5, but maybe not everyone will agree with me. But this is a true gem in the strategy genre.

I loved it. Barely understood it as I was too young but I loved it. Lost the game at some point and didn't play the other CIV games until I bought CIV4 during a Steam sale. While the graphics improved a lot from the first game I did not enjoy the game as much. It was rather simple and straight forward. So now during another sale I decided to buy CIV3 as a lot of people are saying it's the  best version. A few hours in and I have to say I like this one better then 4. The game is a bit more challenging even on easy mode and I am just having a fun time creating my own civilizations. That however doesn't mean there aren't any downsides. Some things do not make sense like older units being stronger then newer units. Then there is the little glitch that you will constantly be aware of and that is that it looks like the game is freezing at the end of every turn. It just freezes for a few seconds and then continues but it is a bit of a pain. So far I have no had it shut down on me completely like I am reading in other peoples reviews but who knows it might just happen at some point. Honestly for the money I paid for it I won't complain much. It would have cost me more to get the cd version though I wouldn't have the glitch. My opinion? Totally worth playing and if you don't mind waiting a few seconds at the end of every turn get the steam version. If you do then buy the cd version. Have a lot of fun with it!\n\nP.S. having the chance to build your own castle is something I missed in CIV 4 glad to see it in CIV 3 :)","January 4","true","15.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Civ V doesn't let you have ICBMs. However, in Civ III, I've got ICBMs in at least 20-30 cities, tactical nukes everywhere, subs (with tacticals) spread all across the map targeting all coastal and inner coastal cities. I can start WWIII any time I want, and I can be sure that I will have no shortage of nukes. Plus just painting some island in that b, e, a, utiful orange coat is just a pleasure.

Otherwise you can lose land to an invasion you weren't prepared for. Tech trees are nice, lots of tech through the different ages, some of which reward being the first to research it.

The game was visually an improvement over Civ II, and the interface was actually functional.  I just felt the combat system was poorly done, diplomacy didn't feel right, and the game has a few design quirks.  Fast forward to now, I decided to buy the complete edition, which updates the game.  What I find now is a game that truly stands between the majesty of Civ II and Civ IV.  The Civ experience is there, and it's well represented.  The graphics haven't aged all that well, and the interface isn't as nice as the later games, but the gameplay remains classic Civ.  The complete edition adds the feature of customizing the game in ways never seen before or again in a Civ game, such as turning down (or up) AI aggression.  It is a good, cheaper entry into the world of Civ.","July 30, 2012","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No other Civ has the same amount of sheer content as this one: From civs to leaders, buildings, wonders, scenarios, you name it. Also, the leader's personalities shine, and the diplomacy system is much deeper than in the newer iterations, you can basically tell Ghandi to go ♥♥♥♥ himself if he pisses you off. In general, the game is deeper than both its successors, but the tutorial does a good job of teaching you the basics. The rest can be learned through experience.

Months of stellar behavior later I managed to earn another copy on my birthday, which was quickly destroyed a month later due to an average of ten hours a day, and 16 hours on the weekend.  I was able to get another disc copy without my parents knowing but I could not control my addiction, causing them to find out about my new copy and promptly destorying it.

I'm terrible at them. This one is no exception. Additionally, I bought this a week before losing internet for an extended period of time, so my hours are waaay off.\n\nThat being said, I've been playing since 2011 when I was looking for cheap games on Steam. To my surprise, I noticed one of the five dollar games had a 90/100 on Metacritic whereas many other games had a 70/100 at best (I cared about Metacritic back then, sue me.) so I knew I just had to have it. I had no idea what I was getting into.\n\nTo this day, this one of my most cherished purchases on Steam, and by far my favorite strategy game EVER. I played Civ 5 for a bit, but despite its evergrowing modding scene, I always come back to this one. The graphics still look good to this day (Save for the civ portraits, and dated resolutions.

Now, Civ 4 was a good game, and while the less that is said about Civ 5 the better (if you ask me), in my mind Civ 3 was the epitome of the Sid Meier vision for the series and the greatest achievement of aesthetics, style, pacing and general gameplay - as far as Civ gameplay could go.\n\nI think this has a lot to do with the predecessors. Civilization: Call to Power was an epic computer game, surpassing and extremely entertaining. Alpha Centauri was of course one of the very greatest titles the genre has ever seen, encorporating gameplay additions and features - so much recorded voice acting~ - that still feel fresh and ingenious to this day. It was into this setting of established 2D, top down turn based strategy excellence that Civ 3 had to plonk, and what a plonk it was.\n\nHow did it work so well? Well it was the way the game juxtaposed itself against it's lineage as much as the way it reproduced and refined it that really rung true with me. Civilzation 3 was all about resolution, refinement, aesthetics and staid excellence. The pacific colours, the fantastic drawn visions of your cities, the subtly faux-3D border markers, the movements of the characters, sounds and the pacing of the game were all just totally lovely touches that made this experience feel high quality and timeless.\n\nPlaying it today reveals a game that is completely succesful as a final installment in a series, even though the series itself continued on into the age of 3D. There are flaws of course - in end game especially the dominated maps completely cede any kind of influence over gameplay to your railways, aircraft and ICBMs, the voice acting of Alpha Centauri would have been really great here (it was used for Civ 4, famously, with Leonard Nimoy granting that game degrees of cultural magic that few computer games enjoy) and one could say that consequently the gameplay gets a bit stale towards the later stages of a long game, but it is what happens in the interim - especially the first three quarters of the span of civilization you navigate - that is a really wonderful experience, worth any price.\n\nPlay it!","May 21","true","13.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pooxel/recommended/3910/","pooxel","Pixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pooxel/","108 products in account","I love this game. Out of any of the Civ games, it is, in my opinion, the one with the best sense of scale. The combat is slightly unbalanced (Memetic mutation of a spearman beating a tank, after all...) and the interface isn't as perfected as in Civ 4, but these issues come up less often than you think. Its editor is simple to use and its modding community is huge even after all these years (possibly even the largest of the series from what I've seen). You can find mods and extremely well-done player-made campaigns about everything from the Reconquista and the Punic Wars to the Portuguese Colonial War. I especially recommend Age of Imperialism (the mod), and Escape from Zombie Island is another gem that shows just how much can be done with the game's relatively simple editor, completely transforming a game about empire-building into a game about zombie survival. But to be honest, even the vanilla, unmodded game is a blast to play and never really gets old.\n\nIn short, this is a game with endless value and honestly $5 is a steal. It's something I never get bored of and always come back to binge on every month or so. Fantastic game, a masterpiece. My favorite in the series, though I like 4 and 5 too.","May 11, 2015","true","396.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've played 2, 3, 4, and 5. It is definitely worth the purchase if you enjoy older games and or want to see what the game was before IV and V were released. The gameplay is a bit slow but the build up is immersive and can have you hooked for hours. It only shows my short time playing here on steam because I usually play my original version of the game. I must say this port lives up faithfully and I find nothing wrong with it. The battles are interesting and fun but diplomacy and management is where this game shines. If you are more into the combat I'd recommend Civilization IV or V. I recommend this to anyone who played it in the past and loves video game nostalgia.

Turns out this one is so old it is unplayable - I spent 50+ hours getting my head around the basics and made it to a hard-earned "space race" victory, only to get an error message at the victory screen. Game crashed to desktop, no victory registered, had to restart from an older saved game. Got the same result again, discovered the error was not a one-off thing! None of the suggested workarounds on the internetz worked for me (.hof file didn't have any read only restrictions, tried changing the victory video file, switched to game's default resolution etc.). I reloaded the last save and went for domination this time, and boom - crash on the victory screen again. 80+ hours now, and while I will admit it was fun while I was learning the game, the lack of the satisfaction from registering any victories is seriously disappointing.\n\nThe only good that came out of my investment was that I discovered that the series CAN be fun when it works. I bought Civ V recently; I hope that game works without any hitches like the ones that I suffered in Civ 3.","October 11, 2015","false","94.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I am still not sure whether Civilization III was the right choice.\n\nHere are a few topics that I wish to highlight:\n- It is a low-paced, turn-based strategy game with a significant amount of historical content.\n- There are a few variables in the game that the person should learn before starting to play. Luckily, steam provides us with a manual, so DO read it.\n- For beginners, this game may become tough, even at the lowest difficulty setting. Even after learning the basics, there are many things one can do wrong.\n- This game can take MANY hours of your time, and once your civilization has more than 10 settlements, it may take more than a minute to play each game turn. In addition, there may be dozens and dozens of turns before a victory condition is met.\n- Although it DOES seem to work on my Windows 8.1 machine, there are a few frustrating issues, such as window switching not restoring the original resolution until the game is terminated. Also, the game may occasionally crash on some particular user, and so far it has always crashed after the end of a game. This means that the game could have had a better preparation for modern systems.\n\nTherefore, it is both hard to recommend and unrecommend this game. Take this as a midline evaluation. If you have time to spare, go ahead and give it a try. Or who knows, the other games in the series might be more interesting.","September 3, 2014","false","20.5"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","7","22","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/milosgameplayer60fps/recommended/3910/","milosgameplayer60fps","Milos Gameplayer 60fps","http://steamcommunity.com/id/milosgameplayer60fps/","121 products in account","General - 8.0\nSid Meier's Civilization is one of the greatest game franchises ever, it's a landmark for every turn-based strategy game. The name itself tells what the game is about, you pick one civilization, select a location to start, select CPU controlled civilizations and settings for that specific map. Your job is to make your civilization meet any of the victory conditions, which can be through science, military, culture, diplomacy, points, etc. The first game of the series I played was Civ II, back in 2001, which instantly made me a fan since then. However I skipped Civ III at its time, and that is what made me buy it many years later. I paid around 1USD for the game just to see what I missed, and unfortunately, not much. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game, but if you played Civ IV, in my opinion, there is nothing in Civ III that will be better than in the later game. It's only worth playing for saudosism purposes. It's heavily outdated.\n\nContent - 8.5\nSteam version is a complete version, which includes both expansion packs released. You have a vast number of civilizations to pick and you can adjust some major settings for a location, like temperature, umidity, geological era, water level, etc. You can also chose the victory conditions for a game, which you can fit into your play style, along with difficulty level. The Civilopedia is a tool of great educational value, it contains real data about the civilizations, technologies, unities and almost everything you can find in the game. There is a highest scores table too, but I believe it only displays single-player scores. I don't know if steam is providing some sort of multiplayer support at this time.\n\nGameplay - 4.0\nLike most Civ games, you start with a settler, a worker and/or a warrior in most cases, from this you have to build your city and administer it's growth with the resources gathered around it, which can be selected in the city radius. Each unity you create in a city has a better use, and through the years (turns), as long as your cities and citizens are productive you'll eventually discover technologies which improve your unities and your cities buildings. You can focus your whole civilization in a few aspects or diversify your knowledge. Every civilization on the map have it's own personality and choices, from warmongers to pacifists. What you have to do is to secure your civilization a place in history. But why I give 4.0? It won't help you get started at all. I'm not asking for a strategy guide, I just wanna learn the basics of the game, what's unique to it, what options I have and what they do. I couldn't find a tutorial or at least a checkbox to display tooltips, even the options in the main menu don't have a basic description. It's one of the less intuitive game I've ever seen, unlike it's predecessor ou sucessor. Of course after sometime you'll start to get used to the controls, but they still feel weird. The UI is not friendly even for games older than it is, Age of Empires II is older and has a much more friendly interface and controls.\n\nGraphics - 2.5\nThe game looks very bad even for its generation, Age of Wonders and Medieval Total War had much better visual quality. Civilization III looks so bad that if affects gameplay, you need to often take a closer look to identify some terrains and unities. There are no options for good graphic enhancements, you can not adjust resolution, it's based on desktop resolution, and even tweaking can't get satisfactory results. I know it's an old game, but the ones I cited are old too and are from the same genre. At least the game showed an improvement compared to the previous title, texture quality is better and there are movement animations for the unities.\n\nOverall - 5.8\n\nCurrent specs\nIntel Core I7-4770K at 4.2ghz\nNvidia PNY GTX 770 2gb at 1201mhz\nKingston HyperX DDR3 8gb at 1600mhz (x2)\nHP 1TB SATA III 7200rpm\nWindows 7 Premium SP1\nSony Bravia KDL-42W655A at 1080p","January 9, 2015","false","1.5"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","25","4","16","3","20"

Learning the system and "how to beat it" itself was an enjoyable that I still can't fully claim to have achieved.\n\nCons-\n\nThere is no help in-game in actually learning the game. This will either add hours of patience in learning the game, or frustration.\n\nThe computer AI is abhorrent for trading.\n\nFair Warning: This game is SLOW. I am okay about slow games, when I am mentally prepared for it. This game is so slow, whether due to micromanagement, organizing your thoughts, or constant unit/city decisions. In my opinion, the pacing of this game is not evidence of a detailed well thought out game (which yes, it is), but of a poorly designed game. Even in "speed-mode"...just ugh, it's still slow.\n\n\nI suggest that if you are interested in a strategic, decision-making game, and ok with long games, the Civilization games will suit your needs. Furthermore, I suggest looking into Galactic Civilizations, at the least for the sake of a real tutorial.\n\nAgain, if you're new to these games, do your research and check out other people's opinions before diving into the Civilization world.","June 6, 2014","false","43.8"," 19 of 50 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","19","50","0","1"

I enjoyed it, the learning curve was interesting and I wanted to know how good I could get at it. Some great features stood out, I even played it with a friend on LAN. But it being so dated, and lacking modern user-friendly polish that so many devlopment teams easily manage nowdays, it regretfully doesn't stand up to modern games for me. I would give this one a miss, unless you love RTS turn based games or lost your original disks, since it's cheap.","August 15, 2012","false","44.8"," 7 of 38 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","7","38","0","0"

I was hoping that Civ IV was that point where the devs went through a 'lets temporarily sell out and ♥♥♥♥ up the franchise for a while' phase, but it turns out Civ III is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as well.\n\nOkay, it's not as silly as Civ IV.  In may ways, I still despise Civ IV, but I'll admit it's a nitpick.  I'd give it the same rating otherwise, because it's almost the same game.  Civ IV's interpretation of religion is silly.  Read the other review for more about that.\n\nOkay, enough about ♥♥♥♥ing Civ IV, lets talk about Civ III.  But what is there to talk about really?  I tried to have fun, but it was the dullest 5 hours on chieftain (easiest difficulty) of moving around a bunch of soldiers and workers (that's all this game is, soldiers and workers and building ROADS) with the scandinavian vikings that I used to conquer the Aztec empire (ultimately a game of city tag), while fending off Japanese and Romans, I've ever had.  Eventually, I resigned, because Sumeria was really big, Persia entered a 'golden age', and I had to end it at some point.\n\nThere was no way to end this game properly without playing for another 8 hours, and that was a standard size map.  The one thing I sorta appreciated was how the enemy leaders poke fun at you for quitting.  The victory screen scores, such as 'children per family', 'population', and 'average lifespan', are mostly purely for flair and meaningless.\n\nFinal Score - 38/100","January 5, 2013","false","6.4"," 2 of 26 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","2","26","0","1"

I still remember my first victory, so many years later. I remember just how proud I was, looking at all those beat up other leaders, mine staring at them with a ♥♥♥♥ faced grin of complete pompus superiority, I felt like I was god. When you actually win, which I've only done once, it feels SO ♥♥♥♥ING GOOD.

Whilst I can't think of anything in particualar that it did better (other than the attack/defense of troops instead of some weird strength system that makes no sense and a clear hit point bar showing you how much health your troops have left) the overall feel of this game (and it's soundtrack!) make for the most fun out of the 3 games (3, 4 and 5) that I have played.

A guy I worked with talked about it, and I bought it. This was a few months before Civ IV came out.  I became a bit obsessed. We even had a play-by-email game going for a while.\n\nI have no idea how many hours I put into it, but it was a lot. I think I've bought it three times since then. I still love the game. I'm far more likely to play Civ V now, but I just like knowing that Civ III is there, any time I want to play it. Civ III was my gateway game to AoE, RoN, AoM... all of which I have also bought multiple times and currently have installed on my computer.\n\nYes, most of my warm fuzzy feelings may be simply nostalgia, but I do think the game still has a lot to offer.","March 9, 2014","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Littlenymph/recommended/3910/","Littlenymph","littlenymph","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Littlenymph/","61 products in account","From the very beginning, every mainline edition of the Civilization series has gotten an average of a 90-95% user approval rate which is a greater approval rate than that normally ascribed to civilization itself. This could be due to the fact that the Civilization seies simply soars while civilization itself seems to soar and stink in equal measure. Then again, it could be that the game of Civilization simply appeals to the inner narcissist lurking somewhere within us all. After all, how often is it you can be elected ruler of your nation by popular acclaim, rule them in a governmental form of your choice, eventually rise to rule to world, establish Earth's first off world colony, and live for centuries. I have to admit that is slightly more ambitious than my own real world expectations, but I do have an eye on the North American continent. Consider yourself warned.\n\nNow don't get me wrong here. I am not trying to say that Civilization is the best turn based, civ building, strategy game ever. That would be unfair to all those games I have not gotten around to trying. What I can say is that it is by far the best I have ever played, and narcissist that I am, I will try most anything that gives me a shot at world domination.\n\nThe Civilization series is up to Civ-5 at this point, but Civ-3 is a game which endures the times, remains comparable to like games of more recent production, and holds a special place in my heart when compared to the newer versions of this long running classic. Later editions of this game introduce elements which alter the play style and base strategy of the game, but while I believe that Civ-4 & 5 remain true to the original construct to a large degree, it is Civ-3 which most closely  resembles the original. In fact, it is exactly like the original, but with greater user options, and smoother game play.\n\nIf you have been thinking about giving this series a try, Civ-3 is a great place to start. With the release of Civ-5, the Steam price for Civ-3 is a mere $5.00 which in my opinion makes it one of the best bargains in the entire Steam Library. Just one run through of this game will keep you occupied for longer than the run time of a long movie, and when was the last time you got into a movie theatre for &5.00 eh? I began playing this game when it first came out for PC in the 90's, continue to play it to this day, and played Civ-1 & 2 before that. How's that for a testament for long term replayability? I simply could not recommend another game of this type more highly.","June 25, 2015","true","620.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, on your first game you ever play, make sure you make it so it's on the easiest difficulty and do a little amount of Civilizations otherwise you will get brutally battered like a Cod fish.\n\n10 features Civilization 3 has that Civilization Revolution Doesn't\n\n1. You can alter the map size between Tiny and Huge.\n2. You can alter the settings on how to win the game.\n3. The Middle Age is included.\n4. You get workers to build Outposts, Mines, Barricades, Irrigation (farm/food resources) etc.\n5. There is more research.\n6. More units.\n7. Create your own map in the editor.\n8. Edit the map properties.\n9. More Civilizations.\n10. More Civilizations allowed to be active in game.\n\nKeep in mind that Civilization Revolution is newer than Civilization 3.\nI can't really think of anything you can't do in Civilization 3 that you can in Civilization Revolution.\nI cannot compare Civilization 3 to Civilization 2, 4 and 5 as I do not have those and I have never played them. I would assume that Civilization 4 and 5 are better though.\nI completely reccomend this game and I'd say it is still a brilliant game now in 2014 and that takes a lot for a game to be that good!\n\nHope this makes you want to buy Civilization 3 because it deserves more buyers. This game is also very handy if you have have a bad Graphics Card and Processor like my computer. When it says it runs on Windows XP only it really means Windows XP or better.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Littlenymph/recommended/3910/","Littlenymph","littlenymph","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Littlenymph/","61 products in account","From the very beginning, every mainline edition of the Civilization series has gotten an average of a 90-95% user approval rate which is a greater approval rate than that normally ascribed to civilization itself. This could be due to the fact that the Civilization seies simply soars while civilization itself seems to soar and stink in equal measure. Then again, it could be that the game of Civilization simply appeals to the inner narcissist lurking somewhere within us all. After all, how often is it you can be elected ruler of your nation by popular acclaim, rule them in a governmental form of your choice, eventually rise to rule to world, establish Earth's first off world colony, and live for centuries. I have to admit that is slightly more ambitious than my own real world expectations, but I do have an eye on the North American continent. Consider yourself warned.\n\nNow don't get me wrong here. I am not trying to say that Civilization is the best turn based, civ building, strategy game ever. That would be unfair to all those games I have not gotten around to trying. What I can say is that it is by far the best I have ever played, and narcissist that I am, I will try most anything that gives me a shot at world domination.\n\nThe Civilization series is up to Civ-5 at this point, but Civ-3 is a game which endures the times, remains comparable to like games of more recent production, and holds a special place in my heart when compared to the newer versions of this long running classic. Later editions of this game introduce elements which alter the play style and base strategy of the game, but while I believe that Civ-4 & 5 remain true to the original construct to a large degree, it is Civ-3 which most closely  resembles the original. In fact, it is exactly like the original, but with greater user options, and smoother game play.\n\nIf you have been thinking about giving this series a try, Civ-3 is a great place to start. With the release of Civ-5, the Steam price for Civ-3 is a mere $5.00 which in my opinion makes it one of the best bargains in the entire Steam Library. Just one run through of this game will keep you occupied for longer than the run time of a long movie, and when was the last time you got into a movie theatre for &5.00 eh? I began playing this game when it first came out for PC in the 90's, continue to play it to this day, and played Civ-1 & 2 before that. How's that for a testament for long term replayability? I simply could not recommend another game of this type more highly.","June 25, 2015","true","620.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Civilization 3 is also very light on your computer, so if you don't have the latest monster machine, Civ 3  will run smoothly on your rig. I have ran this game on an old pentium 4 without problems. definitely recommend it.

The graphics aren't enivable at all because, well, it is nearly 14 years old. It crashes sometimes too. There is quite a learning curve, but after a while you do get through it. The AI is random or too predictable at times, if they plop a stack randomly into your territory and refuse to leave, they're 90% going to declare war. Playing on easier levels, outsmarting the AI is fairly formulaic, aggressive expansion for the first half, strategically stealing all resources and then ploughing through them all. Small maps are too small, and if you create a massive map (which you can do in the editor, which itself has a learning curve) there is a city limit of 450. The game reaches its limit, but by that point each turn is so long, why bother. Naval conflict is always a bit piddly too.\n\nBut really the base game has a simple enough format that its almost like a PC version of Monopoly. You can play it again and again, no fancy 3D experience or anything, the graphics really don't impede gameplay. 14 years later its still perfectly playable and, importantly, provides a fun and varied experience. Each game comes out wildly different from the last one, and every time you play a new challenge will arise. The randomized earths created offer nearly infinite variety and eliminate any boredom you could experience with similar games. I can easily play this game for hours and hours. Similar to Paradox games, once you start a campaign its hard to finish, there is enough variety in maps you always want to do something else. Games can easily go far into the future, and with some mods you can add some variety onto the existing game's timeline.\n\n9/10 game!","October 17, 2015","true","92.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Littlenymph/recommended/3910/","Littlenymph","littlenymph","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Littlenymph/","61 products in account","From the very beginning, every mainline edition of the Civilization series has gotten an average of a 90-95% user approval rate which is a greater approval rate than that normally ascribed to civilization itself. This could be due to the fact that the Civilization seies simply soars while civilization itself seems to soar and stink in equal measure. Then again, it could be that the game of Civilization simply appeals to the inner narcissist lurking somewhere within us all. After all, how often is it you can be elected ruler of your nation by popular acclaim, rule them in a governmental form of your choice, eventually rise to rule to world, establish Earth's first off world colony, and live for centuries. I have to admit that is slightly more ambitious than my own real world expectations, but I do have an eye on the North American continent. Consider yourself warned.\n\nNow don't get me wrong here. I am not trying to say that Civilization is the best turn based, civ building, strategy game ever. That would be unfair to all those games I have not gotten around to trying. What I can say is that it is by far the best I have ever played, and narcissist that I am, I will try most anything that gives me a shot at world domination.\n\nThe Civilization series is up to Civ-5 at this point, but Civ-3 is a game which endures the times, remains comparable to like games of more recent production, and holds a special place in my heart when compared to the newer versions of this long running classic. Later editions of this game introduce elements which alter the play style and base strategy of the game, but while I believe that Civ-4 & 5 remain true to the original construct to a large degree, it is Civ-3 which most closely  resembles the original. In fact, it is exactly like the original, but with greater user options, and smoother game play.\n\nIf you have been thinking about giving this series a try, Civ-3 is a great place to start. With the release of Civ-5, the Steam price for Civ-3 is a mere $5.00 which in my opinion makes it one of the best bargains in the entire Steam Library. Just one run through of this game will keep you occupied for longer than the run time of a long movie, and when was the last time you got into a movie theatre for &5.00 eh? I began playing this game when it first came out for PC in the 90's, continue to play it to this day, and played Civ-1 & 2 before that. How's that for a testament for long term replayability? I simply could not recommend another game of this type more highly.","June 25, 2015","true","620.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

People may have complained about bombardment and bombers being Op since they can straight up kill units but I find this adds a lot more tactical complexity to war, especially in the mid Ind. age where it really reflects how much warfare at that time was based around defensive positions.\n\nThe campaigns within are straight up the best of any vanilla Civ game, Rise of Rome, the Middle Ages and the Age of Discovery are excellent, and hell the Pacific Theatre almost could've been its own game!\n\nFinally, it may be a personal thing, but I've always preferred the isometic display here to the 3d graphics of 4, 5 and Beyond.\n\nAnd as a small side note, because of how cheap this game is now it can be an effective litmus test to see if you'll even enjoy Civ games, so there's that.","December 14, 2015","true","143.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abusedponynu/recommended/3910/","abusedponynu","Pony Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abusedponynu/","18 products in account","I have civ5 complete too. Like some of the other reviews I found the game fairly different from civ5. Definitely worth the buy ($1.37 on sale). Not having the culture group stuff from civ 5 makes the game alot better. Another up compared to civ 5 is that it doesnt have the fancy graphics, so I can run it on my work laptop (which has no dedicated gpu) [civ 5 to go? lel].\n\nI find the whole idea of *clicking on my temple to add an upgrade (all visual?)* pretty pointless and dumb. I literally just hover my touchpad over the whole screen till i hear a sound, then click and escape. It was pretty annoying to\n\nThe time it takes to finish a game is both a pro and con. If you are a time sensitive person I would suggest you turn off move animations for all units because you will leterally have your eye pop out waiting for allt he units to move at the end. Some of the other default settings also made the game annoying to play. In particular, if you have units which are fortified or in alert stances, the turn may very well pass away under the default setting unless you do some annoying repetitive camerfa movement. There was a setting to wait at the end of ever turn to make this easier, I'm totally fine hitting space bar or enter at the end of every turn then watch things happen in a way i didn't want it.\n\nI still have to learn about some other mechanisms in this game before I comment further. I'll probably add more next time i stop by.","May 16","true","45.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
