Well look right here.\n\nI have 100+ seconds in every level on Super Hexagon so beating the first two levels in Unpossible was pretty easy already. There's only three real levels and trying to beat them when you're super experienced at Super Hexagon and Open Hexagon makes completing the game a breeze. I was able to complete this game relatively quickly.\n\nNow the LAST level was pretty difficult in my own opinion and pretty fun, but I didn't like the rings that made you rotate around that cylinder liked wire looking thing that you're always rotating around. It was basically a test of "How long can I tap the left/right arrow key without messing up" rather than "How well can I react based on reflex." I also really dislike how I can't use a mouse instead of a keyboard but that's just my preference.\n\nCompared to other rage quit games (Super Hexagon, Velocibox, and Geometry Dash for examples)... This game, as I have stated, only has three levels. It's great graphic wise and has good soundtracks, but I find myself unable to enjoy this game for very long. However, I do like how you are able to manipulate the sensitivity of your screen's rotation as other rage quit games don't allow for such a feature.\n\nHonestly, not the greatest of games that taxes your reflexes like others do... But not the worst. You can surely wait for a sale before buying this game.","January 7","true","1.1"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

Not a great lifespan.\n\nThe music isn't too bad if you're into this genre, so if you're willing to drop a couple bucks to chill out with a fairly easy game it's okay.

But there is a major problem with it: the course curves randomly.\n\n"Why is that a problem?" You ask.\n\nThe reason is it's unfair, at times you don't have the ability to see what's coming fast enough to react. The obstacles can be hidden behind the course, or other obstacles, until you are right on top of them.\n\nNow I'm not the best when it comes to reflexes (I have yet to beat Hexagonest in Super Hexagon) but I am aware that despite my disabilities in the area, Super Hexagon is fair, you can ALWAYS see what's coming in time to avoid it. This game is not fair, since it advertises itself as fair, I cannot give it a positive review.","May 19","false","0.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has 3 modes of difficulty: Simplicity, Futile, and Ultra, and every time you play,  the stage is more or less random with obstacles placed in a different pattern. You do get some types of obstacles more common in one difficulty than another, but their placement and pattern often varies. Your goal is to last as long as you can.\n\nFor each difficulty level you also get a special daily stage. This stage only changes after every 24 hours, so if you're not a fan of the randomness aspect, you can always play the daily stage and try to memorize your way through it.\n\nThere isn't much else that this game offers, so my only critique so far is that it needs more content, perhaps in a form of more game modes (not necessarily difficulty, but just different goals), but what it does have is pretty fun if you fancy to test your reflexes, precision, and decisiveness, and it costs hardly anything.","November 20, 2015","true","5.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Player should avoid obstacles while moving along its path. It's kinda like Wipeout Zone mode, but only without Zones.\nThe idea is very fun. However, there comes couple some catches you wouldn't want this game.\n1. There is no progression. Your path is just the same 10 seconds, 60 seconds or 300 seconds into the game, so eventually it becomes boring.\n2. There are literally no settings. No sound volume, no screen resolution selection (thanks god it picks up your current desktop resolution), no windowed mode. I do understand why it's fine for a mobile game, but it's totally not fine for a PC game.\n3. The game plays very good with a controller. But... there are no support for a controller in a main menu. So the game is over (and it will happen quite often) you have to lean for your mouse.\n4. Achievements page opens steam browser, which causes your mouse cursor to disappear. And since you need it to start a new game, things become a little problematic.\n\nThis might not be much, but it really breaks experience. Got the game for like 1$, still is not worth it. I'll prbably leave the game on a follow list, and will buy it again if I get like 75% discount, or those issues will be patched.","December 29, 2015","false","0.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lecrab/recommended/300400/","lecrab","Le Crab","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lecrab/","174 products in account","As a short review it's a great game that introduces a very well designed 3D feel to the reaction game genre. For a pretty low price of $3 (as of 16/12/2015) it definitely should provide a few hours of gameplay.\n\nAs a more critical review here are some points to consider:\n1. Sensitivity is really hard to get right. Depending on what obstacles you face it's either too sensitive for small precise gaps or too slow for long winding turns. For a reaction based game it's somewhat annoying to not have a perfect sensitivity that matches the games design of obstacles.\n2. Other than the few hours of gameplay I mentioned at the start I don't see this game being playable after that. Yes there are achievements but they are somewhat boring (for instance achieving 60 seconds on a certain level on 30 DIFFERENT DAYS? I get they're trying to make you play for longer but it's just boring and meaningless and there's no real sense of achievement).\n3. Music is questionable at times. For a cheap game it's not awful but it could definitely have been designed to be more dramatic rather than just mere electronic background noise.\n4. Visuals could have been so much better. I'm probably just being cynical at this point but considering this game was available previously for IOS and android and was originally released as $10 on steam the developers surely had some budget to ramp up the lighting in the game and sharpen the visuals (the black with blue neons had so much potential to reminiscence TRON).\n\nOther than that I adore the sensation of being inside the game this gives you compared to my typical reaction games like the impossible game or super hexagon.","December 15, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet 2 people found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

For a pretty low price of $3 (as of 16/12/2015) it definitely should provide a few hours of gameplay.\n\nAs a more critical review here are some points to consider:\n1. Sensitivity is really hard to get right. Depending on what obstacles you face it's either too sensitive for small precise gaps or too slow for long winding turns. For a reaction based game it's somewhat annoying to not have a perfect sensitivity that matches the games design of obstacles.\n2. Other than the few hours of gameplay I mentioned at the start I don't see this game being playable after that. Yes there are achievements but they are somewhat boring (for instance achieving 60 seconds on a certain level on 30 DIFFERENT DAYS? I get they're trying to make you play for longer but it's just boring and meaningless and there's no real sense of achievement).\n3. Music is questionable at times. For a cheap game it's not awful but it could definitely have been designed to be more dramatic rather than just mere electronic background noise.\n4. Visuals could have been so much better. I'm probably just being cynical at this point but considering this game was available previously for IOS and android and was originally released as $10 on steam the developers surely had some budget to ramp up the lighting in the game and sharpen the visuals (the black with blue neons had so much potential to reminiscence TRON).\n\nOther than that I adore the sensation of being inside the game this gives you compared to my typical reaction games like the impossible game or super hexagon.","December 15, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet 2 people found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

So very fun! But, also, very difficult!\n\nIn Unpossible, you bassically try to get at least a score of 60 seconds, to go on to the other levels. The levels get more difficult as you progress. There isn't a story in the game, since it's just a game where you beat your high score on each level. For example, the easiest level, (Daily Simplicity), is easy to get a high score. But, in higher and more advanced levels, such as Futile, its's more challenging, and requires you to think fast and on the spot about where you need to go, making getting a high score moe difficult as you progress. The only controls are A and D, so there isn't much complexity there, either.\n\nOverall, this game is really fun. I recommend it to everyone. Plus, it is a very cheap game, so, it's not hard to aquire a copy.","May 2","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
