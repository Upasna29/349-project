Ever wanted to spend an evening with your buddy playing video games but can't because he lives accross the state/country? You can do that, too! Ever wanted to build a mancave but don't have the budget? Here you can have a virtual one FOR FREE!!!! It's free! Totally free! Did I mention that it's free? Why are you still reading this? Download it now! It runs on Source so performance is no issue. It only takes 2GB of space. This is by far the best, most finely crafted, and most original mod ever created. The best part? You don't even need to have a Source game installed! Now if you'll excuse me, I'm a little tired of writing. I'm going to go play Bad Company 2 while listening to Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hippyshake/recommended/266430/","hippyshake","Hippyshake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hippyshake/","1352 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEDIT 2/21/15: Steam Workshop support is up and running for sinlge player mode (to be changed to multiplayer once Valve fixed the Steam-wide Workshop issues).\n\nI installed and tested my first Virtual Desktop way back in 1998. It came with a new Gateway PC and, while it was an interesting concept, there was nothing about it that made me fell like it was any better than just clicking on my desktop icons. Since then, I've tried several more, with the same results: install, play around a bit, say "meh," uninstall. But....this. This...this should be called Addictive Anarchy Arcade. It's ridiculous how often I boot this thing up to walk around a virtual space to play a game, rather than just clicking the link in Steam.\n\nFor an alpha, it's incredibly stable. I've not had it crash once, and it runs much smoother than I had expected, given the age of my computer and the fact that it's a shell that runs other media from within.  The only issues I've noted so far is that it can't play mp3 files (which is probably a proprietary thing), and it's not playing sounds to videos linked from your hard drive, but this is currently being worked on. Another slight issue is that it can take up to two days for newly added games in your Steam account to show up; however, this is an alpha build, and it's something the developer is addressing.\n\nThat said, there is so much goodness here. Obviously, you can use AA to build your own arcade, by very easily linking a variety of cabinets to your Steam Library. There's more though. You can place listening stations (or CDs on tables) or movies on the walls that, when linked to Youtube, any visitors to your arcade can come and watch or listen to. The game (because, at times, it really does feel more like a sandbox game than a virtual desktop) will even synchronize whatever movie you're watching so that you all see it at the same time. That's right: Anarchy Arcade can be multiplayer, allowing others to visit your arcade, and vice-versa.\n\nPlacing items and cabinets can be a bit clunky, but the variety is already pretty large, and there is promised Workshop support (currently, it's offline). New items and buildings (where you can build your arcade) are opened up as you place new items, earning points and reaching goals. It's a clever game-like concept and, while I'd have rather had everything opened at once, it did keep me coming back. Additionally, any content created for Source-engine games (Half-Life series, Portal, Counter strike, et al) can be imported here. Want to create an arcade using your favorite DOTA map? Do it!\n\nThe fact that this is free is just the gravy on this already delicious chocolate cake; once you play around, it becomes clear that this is a quality program from someone who clearly loves gaming and who is skilled at programming. The developer is dedicated, frequently on the forums, and open to suggestions: all bonuses to an already pretty great experience. Oh, and did I mention it has Oculus VR support?\n\nRecommended? Absolutely. And at this price, what have you got to lose? Try it out, and get building: I want to check out YOUR arcade!","February 20, 2015","true","93.1"," 90 of 91 people (99%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","99","90","91","7","4"

It works really well as a 3d desktop app, if you're into that kind of thing. But where it truly shines is on the Oculus Rift. As the Oculus gains acceptance we start to see how the traditional menu > option interaction system become less relevant. Anarchy Arcade is a creative step in the direction of a fully immersive VR-desktop app. As such, it comes with some instructions that you really should read/watch.\n\nOne of my main gripes with the concept is that you have to load up one game to play another. But it's more about the time in between games that matters. If you get bored of playing one game and want to play another, you drop back into Anarchy Arcade and get to find your other game through the VR desktop (a.k.a your 'arcade'). If you're using the Oculus this means you don't have to take the headset off, and it's pretty cool too.\n\nThis is an interesting concept in human-computer interaction and I recommend people check it out. If you HAVE an Oculus, you cannot miss out on this one.","September 1, 2014","true","34.6"," 149 of 180 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","149","180","0","1"

You will get no Steam game time. (All of your individual Steam game times will all be placed on to Anarchy Arcade)\n\n#2. It always runs in the background when you are playing a Steam game through it. While it is only a very minor dip in frames, if you are running on a older system then it will be very noticible.\n\n#3. If you place videos from your PC then you will have many issues such as a annoying stutter, and a de sync which makes the video unwatchable.\n\nOverall Anarchy Arcade is a game with lot's of potential but for me at least it fails, until the developer could perhaps work with Steam to fix some of these issues.\n\n\nUPDATE #1- Tried it out again and it seems as the online portion of the game has been improved. Thats about it. The game is even harder to navigate now and it is as slow and clunky as anything.","August 23, 2015","false","5.6"," 158 of 208 people (76%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","76","158","208","10","6"

It's such a cool idea. Especially if you use your computer mostly for gaming, you can launch it at start up and use your pc as a virtual arcade that you set up with all of your own games. (It's your own hub world for games, music, movies, youtube, et cetera. Whatever you chose to put in.)\n\nThat being said, there's a lot that needs to be done. Tweaks, bug fixes (<s>ways unstick yourself after placing an object inside yourself</s> ), <s>more props to decorate with (I'm always a ♥♥♥♥ for props. I'm talking potted plants people!)</s> You can add by modding but I still say vanilla decorations are better, <s>maybe a DDR type cabinet, huh?</s> (It's an exclusive item appearently.) I'd also like to see ways to continuously stream audio into the world without having to keep the object selected. (Maybe as an option for an items settings, so it can carry over to some other objects like videos or gifs.)\n\nDefinitely give it a try and a follow, just for how uniqe an idea it is. Hope these guys go big with it, I can honestly see it being a complete replacement for your desktop if done right.\n\nEdit:\n\nTwo issues I seem to be running into constantly:\n-If a game requires a resolution change, it changes the resolution of AA and it doesn't return to normal afterwards, requiring a task manager restart. (Since AA doesn't show up in the task bar. Although this might just be me since I have a few games that usually run in a window, but I force them to run full screen.)\n-For some reason AA seems to crash some of my games at start.

Ive created multiple arcades and even gone into multiplayer with the developer and some other friends to check out their arcades. It is definitely something you should try, especially if you have a large steam/movies/music list. I used it to create FPS or MMO arcades as well as night clubs for my music and movies. It really helped to keep my games seperate and organized and I got to have fun designing the arcade at the same time which is something I really enjoyed about it. The video posted below is an arcade I created with the prototype version a few months back using the PAX map. In each map/world you have the ability to spawn shortcuts to pretty much any kind of media on your computer or on the internet. This gives you the ability to make worlds full of your favorite games and other media. You can also use custom maps from most source games. So say you wanted to make an arcade on B-site in Dust2, or maybe create a twitch/movie theater in Glados's room, By all means, feel free to do so. Models can also be imported, and placed in areas as you see I have done in the video below and those models can actually be set as a shortcut to something. In one of my arcades, just for fun, I spawned a Mario character prop and then linked him to a Mario voice sample I had saved on my computer, so everytime I walked by, I would click real quick and get to hear the sound file play. It's fun things like this that make AA so fun. There are tutorial videos when starting that I Highly recommend watching, as just hoping in and attempting to figure it out might take a while. All in all I highly recommend checking this out. If you have any questions from me feel free to ask below.\n-Happy Gaming\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zfe-g9f3V9Y","September 3, 2014","true","0.6"," 47 of 64 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","47","64","0","6"

Anarchy Arcade is essentially a 3-d desktop giving you the abilty to load up any map, weather it be a default one or a custom one(You can use any map from source games like cs go ect.), and you can then place essentially well ANYTHING. Images, movies, games, youtube videos,websites, i tunes, netflix, old nes and arcade games, and even those videos you prefer not to watch on your regualar browser if you catch my drift. Each thing you place down acts as a shortcut like one would work on your desktop, you just simply click on it and launches the item at hand weather that be a game or video or whatever so long as you have it or its of the internet.\n\nThe game allows for you to be droped in an area and to create an arcade of what ever you can imagine, its a briliant idea but not only that it actually works suprisingly well. Your given the ability to place down again ANYTHING, place a picture from google on the wall, make a room full of snes and sega genesis games, fill a room with youtube videos or music, or even just make a room full of entirely props and manequins of charactrs from your favorite games. Props are essentially "acessory" items and can be placed anywhere to add more of a feel to the game such a couch, shelves, plants and ect.\n\nDespite its earliy acess state, and the game being a one man development project, it still manages to get updated constantly with each one ading new things such as the metaverse mode. This is a mode that allows for nemourous people to be in the same map and create stuff at the same time and build an arcade together. The best part about is that if you have the game or item placed then YOU can launch it even if someone else placed it. The game is free and kind of hard to understand at first but its one of those things you have to try before actually judging it, also the game is described well in the description and in the videos.So despite some of the work it may or may not need it still stands out a unique and interesting so i would say to just try it and if you dont like it then so be it, but atleast give it a chance.","February 22","true","143.3"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","20","21","2","0"

And, it being in the source engine, has VR support. Sometimes moving certain objects can be a small bit of a pain as in You can't have a flat screen TV sitting on a desk, it has to be hung up on a wall or precariesly placed so it appears to be standing. And if you're one of the people that spend 40 minutes rearanging furniture in Animal Crossing like me, you can see why this is a problem. Also, as much as it is fun to mess around with, the in-game level editor is litteraly just Hammer with a few prefabs like doorways, lights, windows, and about 8 different textures on cubes, but a nice addition none the less. The multiplayer capability that comes with most source games is prevalent in Anarchy Arcade, but because of all the customizable "cabinets" it can take up to an hour just to join a friends game. If these could be fixed in the near future, I, without any shadow of a doubt, would reccomend anyone to at least try Anarchy Arcade, and as of the time writing this the promise of a Steam Workshop would make the whole expirience complete. So have it download in the background or something right now, and just try it. You may like it, you might REALLY like it, or you might just think it's pointless, but you should try it.

The idea of a virtual physical space to store and showcase your media is certainly interesting, but to me, the convenience of clicking an icon or loading a browser tab outweighs this game's coolness. I was also primarily interested in streaming videos and things with friends, "Gmod cinema"-style, but the interface is just too clunky and buggy for me to bother with. And I think the inability to go full-screen and remove the window chrome for the sake of quick access to your normal desktop is a poor design decision that only makes it less immersive. But, granted, the interface hiccups and locked windowed mode are reasonable issues that you'd expect from an Early Access game. And you can't beat free.\n\nIt's just not for me.

Also great for people with OCD who would like a way to organize their games in a visual format!\n\nI wish you could just unlock everything one shot instead of the point accumulation to get the stock maps, but life is hard I guess. And in any case seems the workshop maps are plentiful and there is bound to be something that strikes your fancy.\n\nI have to say I'm not using it to launch games or movies, so I can't really comment on that.

Using a nearly unlimited amount of maps thanks to self-porting methods and the workshop, Anarchy Arcade will never get boring. You can use it to store ANYTHING; Website links, music, YouTube videos, Emulators, and more. Anarchy Arcade has direct links to your Steam library; meaning that you can build an arcade using the games you own on Steam. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities; you're able to play your favorite Steam game from within another game. This is one of the better concepts to rise from the Early Access market. 8/10 because of some bugs that can happen, and because I had alot of issues getting it running properly before beginning to play it.

There are a lot of bugs. It really gets annoying, and it's quite annoying to deal with.\n\n2. You can't spectate the games, or play local multiplayer. When you play a game ingame, people can't see it, so you can't do things like playing with other people, and spectate games other people are playing. This limits, playing with other people, it makes it a lot worse of an experience.\n\n3. Lack of players. Not many people play this game, and it gets boring, since I think this would otherwise be one of the game's strengths.\n\n4. Lack of features when making servers.

Whenever I was bored I would go to the game shelf, pick something, dust it off and have an evening of entertainment. Yet now most of the games I buy on steam just stack up in the virtual library that often go forgotten. Having this virtual arcade almost recreates that same feeling of displaying them on a shelf. With my large library of games, I ended up going through and finding a bunch of games that I forgot I even owned which sparked my interest to play them again.\n\nI also really like the idea of being able to stick music/videoclips/artwork up on the walls.

Amongst the contents of the book was a very detailed description of what was then called "Cyber Space". The description of this unknown virtual future included such features as the ability to share live events as though you were in the same space as the other person, the ability to change one's persona with the flick of a pointer finger, and a completely personalized living space that one can privatize at his own will.\n\nAnarchy Arcade contains each of those features in one way or another. My friends, welcome to the first step towards the future.\n\n--------\n\nIn honesty, the application is in dire need of an explanation overhaul. The current method of teaching new users how to use the software is through a strange forced tutorial that people find awkward. However, if you can get beyond all the quirks of a completely free early access Source non-game program, then you'll find that it has a similar sort of appeal to The Sims or Animal Crossing. (I.E.

Create a virtual room for that abundance of pron you have sitting in your hard drive. Or spam your room with anime characters. The point is your options are endless. With the ability to add anything into the game you wont. The game has an easy to follow tutorial so you can get a feel of the game. The more you add to your arcade the more rewards you get. It's free so what are you waiting for download it.","September 11, 2014","true","57.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","2"

It kinda reminds me of Aech's basement in Ready Player One.  However, after about an hour of fiddling, I basically accomplished nothing.  I put some of my games in those neat arcade cabinets.  But I couldn't get all of my games in those cabinets and that frustrated me to NO END.  And speaking of those cabinets, why on earth do they link up to their Steam page? Just launch the game! Instead there is this tiny play button on the side that I barely noticed and is 100% inconvenient.\n\nThen there is the problem of the workshop.  While I fully admit that I would never find the proverbial dead body on the second page of search results, on the first page where all the cool stuff should be were a bunch of niche cabinets.

This title allows you to make virtual shortcuts to your Steam game library as well as non-steam titles,.. and lest we forget you can easily link to basically any image, movie, or web addresss that you like and attach it to in-game objects (arcade machines, television screens, etc.).

It's hard to explain, but there are videos about it, and it's free, so just try it out. Basically, it's like Garry's Mod with regards to the Steam Workshop, but it's a little different. Imagine taking your File Explorer and making it into a 3D space. That's essentially what this does.\n\nIt's super fun to make an arcade, and the game allows you to do your own thing. Personally, I prefer to be a little less crazy and not have arcade machines everywhere like in some people's spaces, so I made a desk with a computer, and then I put in a shelf which has all my games as CD cases (with box art).\n\nOne of the best features is that you can customize stuff like box art, cover photos, and the trailer video. Have a cool screenshot from Borderlands? Make it the demo photo! You and your squad made a funny machinima in Counter-Strike? Make it the trailer! Want to see a picture of Kim Kardashian every time you load up Dota 2? Do it. I won't judge you.\n\nPros:\n- Open ended and tons of fun to mess around with\n- Workshop gives endless content\n- Unlocking new items is relatively easy\n- Free\n\nCons:\n- You have to unlock things, not everything is given at once\n- Workshop files tend to be packages with a few cool things and a lot of stuff you don't want\n- Steam doesn't let you run multiple instances of one game, so you can't run Anarchy Arcade inside Anarchy Arcade","August 26, 2015","true","11.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Well to put it simply it's a modified Source Engine virtual desktop that allows you to create and simulate your own arcade or theatre experience using virtually any kind of media.\n\nThere are 8 (as of this writing) maps which you can unlock and play, each with their own distinct taste where you can build your own custom arcade using a large variety of cabinets and a few props. There is a slight meta-game in unlocking new maps, cabinets, and props through various simple means.\n\nYou can link any media on your PC or on the internet, and use images and videos to provide cabinet marquees and screen images. A convenient website allows you look up most games and movies and automatically downloads images and information for all but the most obscure or indie titles. Steam games are automatically loaded into your library making it easy to place them as arcade cabinets in-game.\n\nWhile no-doubt the concept of a virtual desktop may be lost on some, there is a very pleasing sensibility of being able to craft your own arcade from your PC games and arrange them by whatever categorization you choose, and even give them fitting cabinets (racing cabinets for racing sims, shooting cabinets for FPS, etc.) The props while currently limited do allow you to spice up the maps a bit with some creative planning.\n\nIn addition to arcade cabinets you can also spawn TVs, Photo frames, CDs, and Tablets to display your movie, tv, or music collection, or hotlink a video from youtube or other streaming sites.\n\nMultiplayer is an interesting feature but only works well if you hotlink all media from the internet, otherwise a lot of "broken link" screens will be displayed, but it is a fun way to have a little youtube field trip with your friends.\n\nFor people like me whose media library of games and movies grows rather large, a program like this is a nice visual browser to help you pick a good game or movie to watch that you might otherwise skip over in a long list.\n\nAt any rate, the asking price can't be beat, it's definitely a fun diversion! 8/10\n","September 15, 2014","true","39.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To answer that question, this is basically a game launcher that ate to many Doritos and and drank too much (Mountain Dew).\n\nThis launcher not only allows you to literally place game cabinets linked to your favorite games (with cover art, and previews just like the real thing), it allows you to place interactive shortcuts containing YOUR movies, pictures http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=312391492 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=312391514 websites, YouTube videos, music;,...documents, Excel documents, slideshows(so you can be productive whilst playing a game)....emulators for just about any console, even Wii and GameCube. Oh yeah, and props. There's an incredible attention to detail, with every game cabinet tuned to their genre and with custom cover art. For instance, if I wanted to play F1 2013, the cabinet for it is an actual immersive racing simulator thing, with wheels and everything. For an example, http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=312391448\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=312391471\n\nThere's also a movie theater, so you can watch movies on the wall, whether on a DVD drive, pirated, or on a hard disk.\nAlso, keep in mind this is (unbelieveably) Early Access, and also free, so get it while you can, and please have some compassion for these guys, working their tail end off for US and getting so money for it whatsoever.\n\nOH, almost forgot. It's multiplayer too.\nCategory        Rating out of 10                P.layer A.ttitude R.ating        Not Tested                Atmosphere        10. With many different unlockable enviroments, you actually feel as if you are in an arcade.                Playability        8. The controls are a snap to learn, and the UI is great. Some occasional bugs with fullscreen, making it almost unplayable.                Total      9.5. A great game with a great idea, and minor bugs are the only thing in it's way.","September 10, 2014","true","3.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It does not implement anything well. All props and furniture worth using is fan made and can only be found on the workshop or the internet. Placing items is a pain and there is no simple option to rotate objects or adjust their hight so they rarely end up where you want them. The rom launching feature is very buggy which it makes it nearly impossible to run your favorite Roms, which is the cornserstone of the idea of this game (building your own arcade). I recommend waiting and avoiding the frustration. AA may be great some day but it has got a VERY long way to go.","August 9, 2015","false","10.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

After about 30 minutes you can explore everything the game has to offer. While I enjoy the layouts of the maps my first thought was to port them to Gmod and yes I can confirm they are pretty good build maps and I can even see them being good for Machinimas on SFM or the previously mentioned Gmod. My only problem with the maps is that they tend to look very bland, Especially when you take a look at the outside world which is just a bland Green field with a couple of terribly modeled lolipop shaped "tree's" stuck in the ground.\n\nNot only that but it is missing alot of basic feautres that are already in the Source Engine. Why can't I sit down in furiture I've placed? They just feel lazily cut out to either speed or dev time or for the just mentionied laziness\n\nOverrall Anarchy Arcace can be describled as one thing... Pointless. If I wanted to boot up a game on my PC all I have to do is click the icon on my Desktop and boot up Steam, But with this I have to... Boot up Steam, Load up Anarchy Arcade, Select my map, Place down the arcade machine, THEN I can use the program. Its just adding baracades to what was already a working system.\n\nTopic        Score                Graphics        2.5/10                Gameplay        1.5/10                Music/Sound        0/10              Overall        2.5/10","March 14, 2015","false","4.9"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","1"

This game(?) is so dang simple it's awesome! You get an aparment, and you put shortcuts to your Games and Youtube videos (Or at least, those were the ones I managed to get working.) Basically you kinda get to create a sweet dream Bachelor Pad for yourself and your friends! The content as of now is quite limited, with the whole In-progress thing. And for some reason the menu screens are cropped to the top left of the screen for some reason; and they have a bit of an input lag.\n\nAnd heck, if possible, maybe a better GUI design, and a simpler way to browse your computer to get content. Maybe even added Audio and Image upload support?\n\nBut overall, I'm really hoping for updates and progress to this!\n\n\nIf you've got time to spare, just get this Bachelor Gamer Pad Simulator.\n..Plus, It's called ANARCHY ARCADE.

It's a good idea, but after a while, you tire of placing files in your virtual library of games. It's fun for a while, but it's more of a cool gimmick until they add more content or expand on the idea.\n\nSo overall, I recommend this "game", but only for a quick moment of interest.  The gimmick wears thin after a while, and you will find yourself uninstalling it and forgetting about it.

It's a good idea, but after a while, you tire of placing files in your virtual library of games. It's fun for a while, but it's more of a cool gimmick until they add more content or expand on the idea.\n\nSo overall, I recommend this "game", but only for a quick moment of interest.  The gimmick wears thin after a while, and you will find yourself uninstalling it and forgetting about it. But for a while, it will come across as a very interesting idea.","December 23, 2014","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Since there is no way to bypass the tuturial this makes the game unplayable. There seems to be some fixes and hacks you can use online to get around this, but it doens't speak well for a game when you encounter a game breaking bug in the first 15 seconds of play. They obviously don't do testing so I am not going to waste my time on this.","November 14, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've been building a few arcades and delving into the more advanced stuff including the new "nodes" feature.  This is truly amazing work here.

Once you start creating your dream arcade, you won't want to stop.\n\nRemember, this is EARLY stuff, but really advancing quickly.  The developer is VERY vocal and responsive.

As someone who has a really messy desktop this is nice way to 'force' myself to clean up.\n\nThe 'arcade' idea is cool too. However, it's not very useful for me as I uninstall games once I'm done with them. Very rarely to do I have more than 5-6 games installed.\n\nStill not perfect though and needs a lot of quality of life improvements, but hopefully those will be added as development continues.

But what about those running standard PCs? What about those who're on a limited budget for electricity or even better, why have our PC running the whole time for this? I understand where they're getting the idea, wirtual reality hangout with friends, who the f**k WOULDN'T want to hang out with their friends online in their own club? Believe me, I'd love it too. If it wasn't so cunsuming of my power, my card, and my memory. Keeping that damn thing up all the time is bound to make something go wrong, and your idea is great, it really is, but you need to adjust it for the average man. All day mode, if I suggest, or the standard Silent Startup or some ♥♥♥♥, like Evolve. If you are the hardcore gamer though, I reccomend this, but this mainly gears towards casuals like myself, yes, call it pub-scrub or whatever, but the game demands valuable resources which can die if overused. Frankly, a way to keep it all limited, decent, etc. And yet still be able to retain my PC and it's Desktop would be wonderful, as well as all the casuals.\nBut then again, it's just me saying this.","August 20, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

AA strives to be a virtual desktop, with images, music, videos, shortcuts and objects accessible through 3D space. Being built in the source engine, this concept has its limits. It can be clunky, inefficient and burdensome on a computer. While you can navigate the desktop the same way you would navigate any 3D game, AA is best described as an experiment in personal virtual reality, which is still in its infancy but which is growing rapidly. Depending on your opinion on virtual reality, AA is either a gimmick that will never take off the ground or a glimpse into what virtual reality will bring in the coming decades.\n\nSince only enthusiasts currently possess virtual reality hardware, this may limit the appeal of AA for most Steam users but it more commonly serves a secondary function: providing a backbone for users to create that awesome arcade, game and media room of their dreams. With pre-configured shortcuts being released on the Steam Workshop daily and with constant updates from the very involved and engaging developer, Anarchy Arcade will fully satisfy anybody seeking this latter experience and, who knows? Perhaps in a decade virtual reality will have fully permeated the gaming world and beyond, and AA will be less of an arcade-builder and more of what it is intended to be.","June 19, 2015","true","20.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

They take the form of various TVs or arcade cabinets to display these things. This is just stupid. There is no game or gameplay here. You just spawn things and look at them. Its even less fun than Playstation Home (where atleast you could walk around and take all the free couches you could and take them to your home then build a tower of all the free stuff you got) because you can't do anything aside from mess with the horrible UI and spawn porn. Yes you will spawn porn because you are so extremely bored of this program. Its not a game at all. Now one can get the same feeling from the HL2MP/GMOD Roleplaying mods but atleast theres a game that can be found in that. A loose and floppy game but still a game. AA just isn't anything. Its just neutered GMod.\n\nAnarchy Arcade is just really really stupid. Its the epitome of why greenlight needs moderated or shutdown.  The masses are ignorant and stupid so much that they will support even the most corrupt, stupid, or broken crap that comes up if it looks trendy, hip, and cool. This should not be on Steam, this should not even exist. If I were Valve I would have this taken down immediatly. Pretty much all that is coming down the line from Greenlight is trash which is unfortunate as the few good games are drowned out in a torrential downpour of diarhea.\n\nHonestly I feel stupid now for installing it as I feel it could very well be a trojan horse as it fits the rap sheet perfectly.

Something like the Gmod framework that you can launch games from, share streams with friends, decorate a space to call your own, etc. This seems like it would be the perfect fit, only basically all that's conveyed with it is that you get to see your friends' virtual Gordon Frohman avatar standing staring at a static prop which, if you happen to have registered the same program somewhere on your end, you can also launch. The only way to share video streams is by creating stations linked to specific YouTube videos. And by the way, the process of actually creating and assigning these shortcuts is achieved, in theory, through a "holy ♥♥♥♥ kill the person who thought this was acceptable" interface.\n\nSo close, and yet so, so far.

You would have more fun playing with the mini games on computers in The Nameless mod for five hours than this (But then again, in those mini games there is actually SOMETHING to do!).

Whenever you get a certain amount of points you unlock extra items/shortcut types.

For example it did not find ANY of my steam games like the tutorials said it would. Any time I pasted a link of a picture it would think I am putting a cabinet and would not let me select a frame for the picture..\n\nI like that you can unlock stuff the more you use it, but honestly this isnt a game there shouldnt be micro transactions and everything should be available from the onset.\n\nI understand that creating any type of game takes a lot of time, resources, and money. I have nothing negative to say about them asking for donations.\n\n\n[EDIT]\nSo I decided to try a few times, and actually found a review where a user instructs how to get your assets back should the game start acting weird at first. After figuring some stuff out I put some of my personal stuff in there and I think it will be fun to design a couple rooms for my fiance so she can have an interactive experience when browsing, I put up videos and pics of our pets and music video she likes, and sites she visists.

This genre is virtual reality games. In Anarchy arcade, you go around placing links to your games. Then, you can launch that game from that the arcade rather than Steam.

There's definitely a novelty to putting things all over your room but after that, it's just kind of a launcher. I'm sure I'm missing out on something without multiplayer or source games but it might have a better future through updates.\n\nI'd love to see some new implementations to props and cabinets. Maybe make some that aren't just static and have some kind of animation to them or allow us to pose the props that are just models. Also I'd love to see some kind of integration with .mdl files in the steam folder already like in tf2 and what not but that's asking for a bit much I think.","January 17, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This comes along and completely does all these things that PS Home didn't. I guess though there is some downsides to this mod/thing however as it is a little bit complex to control but overall im really enjoying this, it doesn't take up a lot of ram space either so you could easily run this and say crysis 3 or something else demanding (assuming you have at least 4GB of Ram).  There is oculus Rift (which i don't have so can't comment on) support and multiplayer as well (which i havent tried yet)\n\nThe only small gripe I have is the unlocking part of the game which you have to place certain objects to gain points to unlock more stuff, whats the point in this?\n\noverall though this is a seriously cool thing to try out i defo reccommend to try for at least a few days to used to it\n\nPros\n\n-Lets you customise 6 spaces (with more to come i assume)\n-Lets you have other players join and see your space (haven't tried yet)\n-Has full support for literally any program you have\n\nCons\n\n-A bit fiddly to control but you can get used to it\n-you have to "unlock" things to have access to all objects which is kinda lame\n-Keyboard input is set to american (i live in uk so i had a little bit of confusion with @ and the command key being swapped around)","January 3, 2015","true","26.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A 3D desktop in Source that allows the launching of nearly ANY file? Early access or not, I didn't really think such a thing was possible. I could certainly see videos and images being possible, seeing that many Garry's Mod addons have allowed for such a thing before.\n\nI went into this with high expectations, and I must say that this has passed with flying colors.\n\nI can't really call it a "game" since the most you do is interact in a 3D house to open other games and applications. Regardless, this is one of the most intuitive uses of the Source engine I've seen in some time. Being able to creat your own house to use, or even import large maps in, is also a very creative idea, allowing for a lot of variety in house design and layouts. Not to say that the default maps are bad; they certainly do their job rather well. Still, having the option to use other Source maps is appreciated. I haven't tried custom props yet, but if that works, I would certainly call this "Garry's Desktop."\nI'm also glad that the game aspect, which was what interested me most, works as it should. You can create a cabinet for any game on your computer, and it's not limited to just Steam. You can add games you downloaded online, emulated roms, or games from other online game stores like Origin (consider it the closest thing to playing Titanfall or PvZ Garden Warfare through Steam we're gonna get so far).\n\nNow for a few negatives of mine. These are just a few issues I had with the program itself, but nothing that people should worry about. To begin, some games have issues running when opened through AA. For example, Team Fortress 2 does play, but it will only let me see the gamemode select. I can't open my server list or favorites. Another 2 small nitpicks is that you can't really use the furniture, and you can't have videos playing when exploring the house. What I mean with the furniture is that you can't sit in it like you could with stuff in Gmod. I understand that it wouldn't have much of a point since people will be on a seperate window or fullscreening a video anyway, but a little attention to detail like that would be nice. As for the videos, you can only play them if you have the screen selected, and I'm not sure why that is the case. It would be nice to be able to have them playing even without the video module selected, especially for a guy like me that likes having music playing in the background while playing PC games.\n\nOutside of that, Anarchy Arcade indeed has lots of potential, and has a lot of things going for it in it's current Early Access form. I hope the developers take this review to heart and continue to improve the game.","September 29, 2014","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A rather fresh take on the Source engine, yet still remaining similar to games such as Garry's Mod. I am rather obsesive compulsive with my layou in my own home, so I am far from reaching the creative capabilities. Being free gives you no excuse to avoid this game. Try it at least once to see if its worth it.

It's a house, but much MUCH more than a house. You can slap anything on the walls you please, and no one will look at you like you're a freak. Because we all are. We get that ♥♥♥♥. Do you want a wall sized monitor showing your favorite movie? Yep, you can do that. Or a wall sized picture of a your dog (or cat, or mongoose...you get it) that's just shuffled off the coil? Yes. You can do that, and if you make your arcade public, we'll come over and mourn with you.  Have you always wanted your own arcade, with all of the games you've ever played/wanted to play?

There are a few minor flaws, and getting some things to work (such as importing new models) can be a daunting task for some users.  However, keep in mind this is still early access, so it hasn't been fully streamlined yet.  Despite this fact, it's still worth getting playing around with now, as being able to create your own custom personal space full of your favorite things is something priceless.  Download this, and by all means support it; this has the potential to be as amazing as Garry's Mod, especially once the bugs are out of multiplayer, and "mancave sharing" becomes a hot new thing.","March 9, 2015","true","605.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can place down arcade cabinet-style "shortcuts" to websites and applications on your computer into a virtual space. Where it really shines is playing other Steam games. AArcade pauses to open that Steam game, allowing you to play them, and when you quit, you go back to AArcade. The UI is a bit low-quality and the game is clearly based on HL2 Deathmatch (As tab and the multiplayer options will point out), but given that it's a beta, it's likely a work in pprogress.

I am however a bit disapointed on their approach to multiplayer, this, being a sorce game and often difficult for people to play together in such a fashion as sorce has no idea what a listen server is.  it's an obstable the devs need to conquer as they go along.  maybe make some changes in multiplayer to allow only the host to spawn props but never in a clipping player.","September 4, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A 3D desktop in Source that allows the launching of nearly ANY file? Early access or not, I didn't really think such a thing was possible. I could certainly see videos and images being possible, seeing that many Garry's Mod addons have allowed for such a thing before.\n\nI went into this with high expectations, and I must say that this has passed with flying colors.\n\nI can't really call it a "game" since the most you do is interact in a 3D house to open other games and applications. Regardless, this is one of the most intuitive uses of the Source engine I've seen in some time. Being able to creat your own house to use, or even import large maps in, is also a very creative idea, allowing for a lot of variety in house design and layouts. Not to say that the default maps are bad; they certainly do their job rather well. Still, having the option to use other Source maps is appreciated. I haven't tried custom props yet, but if that works, I would certainly call this "Garry's Desktop."\nI'm also glad that the game aspect, which was what interested me most, works as it should. You can create a cabinet for any game on your computer, and it's not limited to just Steam. You can add games you downloaded online, emulated roms, or games from other online game stores like Origin (consider it the closest thing to playing Titanfall or PvZ Garden Warfare through Steam we're gonna get so far).\n\nNow for a few negatives of mine. These are just a few issues I had with the program itself, but nothing that people should worry about. To begin, some games have issues running when opened through AA. For example, Team Fortress 2 does play, but it will only let me see the gamemode select. I can't open my server list or favorites. Another 2 small nitpicks is that you can't really use the furniture, and you can't have videos playing when exploring the house. What I mean with the furniture is that you can't sit in it like you could with stuff in Gmod. I understand that it wouldn't have much of a point since people will be on a seperate window or fullscreening a video anyway, but a little attention to detail like that would be nice. As for the videos, you can only play them if you have the screen selected, and I'm not sure why that is the case. It would be nice to be able to have them playing even without the video module selected, especially for a guy like me that likes having music playing in the background while playing PC games.\n\nOutside of that, Anarchy Arcade indeed has lots of potential, and has a lot of things going for it in it's current Early Access form. I hope the developers take this review to heart and continue to improve the game.","September 29, 2014","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Have you ever been bored and looked up the history of pirates on wikipedia? In this game, you can make an entire map dedicated to learning about the history of pirates, the origins of pirates, and put real historical documents up on the wall next to pictures of pirates. You can put TV screens everywhere with 20 different pirate documentaries on them if you want. You can download, or make, pirate related models and use them in the map. If you have a couple of pirate related games on steam youcan just add them as cabinets in the map too. This all applies to any concept you can think of.

You just need to make use of the Steam Workshop content so you can get enough pre-made props/images/videos.\n+ Works out-of-box with your Steam game library!\n\nCons:\n\n- Choosing an image isn't as easy as it could be.  I would like to use some kind of file explorer to choose the image file.\n- I want more visual settings!  The virtual space could potentially be a lot more immersive if I could turn off the blue highlight.\n- Not much offline mode content.  Videos so far have to be from an online source for example.

So AA is an awesomely designed program using the SNK toolkit much like Gmod to share and play games as well as show off stuff.

I've been messing around with this "game" for about a few days now.

Some people have made amazing props, models, and maps for you to use. I'm just using the default apartment map though. Nice and simple. Although the lighting is a bit crazy.\n\nI really think the developers can do more with this. How about filing cabinets such as going through Windows documents, photo albums, VoIP (switching between channels in teamspeak, ventrillo, etc). I can't wait to see what they do.\n\nThere is so much potential in this it's crazy. Keep it up. Seriously.

This comes along and completely does all these things that PS Home didn't. I guess though there is some downsides to this mod/thing however as it is a little bit complex to control but overall im really enjoying this, it doesn't take up a lot of ram space either so you could easily run this and say crysis 3 or something else demanding (assuming you have at least 4GB of Ram).  There is oculus Rift (which i don't have so can't comment on) support and multiplayer as well (which i havent tried yet)\n\nThe only small gripe I have is the unlocking part of the game which you have to place certain objects to gain points to unlock more stuff, whats the point in this?\n\noverall though this is a seriously cool thing to try out i defo reccommend to try for at least a few days to used to it\n\nPros\n\n-Lets you customise 6 spaces (with more to come i assume)\n-Lets you have other players join and see your space (haven't tried yet)\n-Has full support for literally any program you have\n\nCons\n\n-A bit fiddly to control but you can get used to it\n-you have to "unlock" things to have access to all objects which is kinda lame\n-Keyboard input is set to american (i live in uk so i had a little bit of confusion with @ and the command key being swapped around)","January 3, 2015","true","26.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can recommend this to those who want to show off their games and what they can make out of their virtual arcade. But that's all in good time short lived.\n\nThe good: You can show off your friends back and forth of the games you play or played in your virtual arcade.\nThe bad: That's pretty much else. Not to mention there are a few bugs that might be found here and there and sometimes if you don't make the arcade to function properly the way you want it, you might have to rewatch the totourals over and over again to make sure you got it right the first time.\n\nI can't really say to recommend getting this or not, so I'll just say no for the time being since there's no undecieded button for reviews. This Half-Life 2 mod is impressive on it's own terms. But lacks feel upon itself of an actual arcade very quickly. This can only be fun just to show off to friends if they have time to see what you have constructed of your own virtual arcade you have made. But none of that really matters with the small libary of maps that are supported on this game. Not to mention if you have a lot of games on steam on the first place to flood the rooms, for example, 200+ games, you're not going to be able to fit them all to show everyone you play. You can only have a few set peices run at a time. If you want to watch the others, you'll have to click on them to display them while they close off the other ones. I know this is a free "game" if you were to call this. Or I guess you can call this an "app". If this thing had more options of making a map you want, had the items for the games you want to display unlocked right off the bat, and somewhat streamlined some more elements to make it a bit better, it would be good. Still, I wouldn't risk of using this due to copyrights being very restrictive if the games are non-steam games or from other platformers from the past to today, this neat little virtual arcade won't last. It's all free. So try it for yourself and show off to your friends to see if you can make something out of it. It would only just be short lived though. Plus, there are some things that seem to bother me either it's my PC or the game itself. The video settings don't seem to save them the way I want them to stay, nd I have to keep manually changing it everytime I start it up. I also don't like the idea in order to use the steam games to be displayed in your arcade, you MUST set your profile to public in order to have the program recognize your games, or else it will not work. Which I must remind anyone who uses a private profile, you have to set it in public to have it function, reset steam, and then it will show the steam games you can show up to display. THIS WAS NOT MENTIONED ON THE TOTOURAL VIDEOS OF THIS! I find it somewhat unacceptable and need to run either a patch or put in a video to show an alternative way of putting them in the game if there are those who want to keep their profiles private. Still, I'll keep toying with it and see if this freebie is worth anything. As of now, not really. You can make as many arcades you can make in this to unlock as many items as you can in about less than 3 hours. Better off when this game is done from early access and might later on add steam workshop, I'd then reccomend this.","September 9, 2014","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To be frank, this game allows you to essentially make 3D version of your desktop, one where you can actually go into and place your shortcuts, games, movies, music, etc as a TV, Arcade Box, Computers and other such appliances. This is definitely a dream come true for anyone with a large amount of music and what not. It'd also intrigue people who want to design a home or apartment with a gaming theme. The game even has multiplayer to bring your friends in and show you your collection. And, as if that wasn't enough, it's Free 2 Play.\n\nAll of this sounds good if it weren't for two flaws. Lack of multiplayer interactions and impracticality. In terms of impracticality, it's not necessarily a good way of starting your games, watching your movies/TV shows or listening to music since, due to the censorships and what not, you won't be able to play movies or music in-game. Luckily, you can actually launch games in it but unless you have a large amount of ram and a good enough processor, it'll freeze when launching a game or lag a bit before it launches.\n\nFor the multiplayer interactions, there isn't really much point to bringing your friends into your apartment other than for bragging purposes. I'm aware of the rules that the game follows as not to break any copyright laws and privacy in terms of movies and music as well as the inability to launch games but it'd have been nice to at least be able to play music and have some tabletop games to play with with your friends. This is in Early Access so who knows what they will add in the future.\n\nOverall, the game is a breathe of fresh air and should definitely be tried out by anyone who has ever wanted to have their Desktop come to life.","April 16, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Have you ever been bored and looked up the history of pirates on wikipedia? In this game, you can make an entire map dedicated to learning about the history of pirates, the origins of pirates, and put real historical documents up on the wall next to pictures of pirates. You can put TV screens everywhere with 20 different pirate documentaries on them if you want. You can download, or make, pirate related models and use them in the map. If you have a couple of pirate related games on steam youcan just add them as cabinets in the map too. This all applies to any concept you can think of. Not only are the possibilities endless for games and media, but also for learning.
