Enjoyed the amusing creatures and the dude in the mirror is creepy! You can die in this! So be careful what items you use on certain creatures. You may be surprised since some awnsers are not so obvious! I wasn't sure what to expect going into this, but I'm hooked!","June 5, 2015","true","3.5"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"
