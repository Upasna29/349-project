The game mechanics, text and all of the art from the book itself is intact and laid out very well along with some music to set the mood (which can be turned off).\n\nFor those who are not familiar with gamebooks, they are literally a cross between Dungeons & Dragons and Choose Your Own Adventure books. You "play" the game while reading the book and choosing different paths with usually a goal to reach in the end. You roll up stats for your character: Skill, Stamina and Luck and also keep track of your equipment on a character sheet. An automap is also featured and very helpful on subsequent playthroughs, because beating these books on the first try is extremely rare.\n\nCombat is done by rolling dice adding your Skill score and comparing it to the creatures result. Higher score hits. This is repeated until someone wins. Other factors come into combat as well...items, luck, escaping, multiple enemies etc. The game can be quite difficult in later parts of the game when creatures tend to be a lot tougher but by then the hero is usually quite capable for themselves.\n\nMost books tell a typical D&D like story and sometimes items or quests are involved to resolve a mystery or defeat some evil foe. The books were quite popular in the 80's and have had a recent resurgence, these games originally appeared on tablets and only now are making their way onto Steam.\n\nAs a final note, I can't recommend these games enough especially for old school RPG players out there. There's nothing quite like sitting down for the night to unwind and relax and playing\reading these on a big screen TV....along with a nice bonus...achievements! A dream come true for me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/recommended/270490/","aussiedroid","Aussiedroid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/","744 products in account","Much to my parents' dismay, reading books never did interest me greatly growing up. That was until I came across the Fighting Fantasy Choose-Your-Own Adventure books. Although more a paperback 'game' than a 'novel', at least I was off the computer :). I would sit & decode them until I knew all the paths, killed every monster & fully explored the world.\n\nForest of Doom was one of the first in the series, yet, to be honest not one of the best. It is certainly one of the more well know titles, but the series did get better & more complex as it went on. The game system was very RPG-lite, granting you some primary stats in Stamina, Skill & Luck plus offering some items to find/use, with combat mechanics coming down to a series of dice rolls used to calculate your attacks. Your stats will also add weight to your rolls. Nothing has greatly changed in the move to a digital format. Like many early text based adventure games, your movement is limited to up to 3 directions/options (sometimes less) .. and you generally can't turn back!\n\nOK, rules are set, I have rolled my stats & started my adventure. The screen is setup like an ebook reader with a few extras. Easy enough to read & navigate around although I would have liked to see a text font size adjustment (by default the text is very large limiting how much can fit on the screen quite significantly). I liked the way the luck dice rolls are inset into the pages & how the dice roll across the page randomly. Turning pages & finding what next to click is no hassle, but the UI does come across feeling a little clunky. Turning a 'few pages', I travel around in search of the War Hammer I need to beat the quest.\n\nSome encounters later, I am a bit battle weary but still standing (made some bad choices). I have some new items though, survived a river crossing & now drying off next to a fire. Didn't take long .. I'm finding myself really getting into adventuring all over again!\n\nThe hand-drawn graphic style used in the illustrated pages are rich & colourful, looking really nice. Other than the audio/visual aspect, one of the main improvements over the paperback is the introduction of a map. No need to go back to the pencil & grid-paper of yesteryear.\n\nMy luck didn't change the following day as I was hit by a cowardly arrow, not long after leaving camp. It's the end for this round, but I have a taste for more adventure!\n\nAdventures don't last for a long time, so is suited to a quick casual session & I have found there to be good replayability while you keep exploring all the branches in the book. Going through & winning by finding the two parts of the War Hammer before you reach the end will take most players a couple of hours (& often many attempts!). Achievements & Artwork collecting are well utilised to encourage you to explore deeper into the Forest of Doom.\n\nI really enjoyed revisiting Fighting Fantasy realm - one I think both readers of the books & new comers can enjoy. I hope this is the start of more being converted to digital, but can't help to take away the feeling that this was a bit of a missed opportunity. It's reproduced the book in a digital form, but in the more basic sense like an ebook reader does. Not a particularly creative adaption; more a one-to-one port. Granted it's more graphical than an ebook reader, but there is little in the way of 'multimedia' enhancements. I wanted to see my digital pages come alive with partial or full narration, more tailored musical experience, proper emphasis with audio/visual at critical times, greater visualisation of the battles or characters/locations you encounter in a user interface that feels less like a mobile app & more 'PC' refined.\n\nTake Choose-Your-Own Adventures to the next level like Telltale did with their interactive adventure games! Still .. all things considered, its an enjoyable casual adventure & gets my thumbs up (despite me wanting more).\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","January 8, 2015","true","5.0"," 35 of 35 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","35","35","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/recommended/270490/","gog-protoss","Protoss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/","4010 products in account","What is The Forest of Doom?\n\nWell, this game is a faithful reproduction of a printed book in the Fighting Fantasy book series (known in Germany as Abenteuer-Spielbuch) by Ian Livingstone. The Forest of Doom was originally published in 1983,\n\nIt is a book where you choose what path to follow, i.e. a kind of role playing game. There is an aspect of randomness by dice having to be rolled for battles and luck situations. Some battles can be avoided even by making clever choices. It is hardly comparable to other RPGs since it is a completely different genre, but what can be said is that the game is by nature very short - you can reach the end in an hour even if you play the first time. There are some different paths to explore, making it rewarding to try everything, but in the end it is something you can play only few times.\n\nThe video game version adds comfort functions such as an unlockable art gallery and oter extras, but also automatic tracking of your items, dice rolls etc, just like other video games do.\nAll in all I would recommend this for fans of the Fighting Fantasy books or those who look for a nice small RPG to read. The storyline is not deep, but when it first came out it probably was the equivalent of video games in book form. So now we have a video game about a book that emulated video games. Or that emulated casual D&D.\n\nRecommended: For everyone, but at maximum 2 EUR / 2.50 USD\n\nEDIT, 10/17/2015: I feel like I did not describe correctly what the gameplay is about, and also not enough of the nostalgic, the aspect of the classic. The book aspect is that it focuses on the story and gives you a set of choices after each step. It is more akin to a text adventure RPG but with graphical interface and multiple choice. So it is rather simple, and at its time as a book was indeed an equivalent of a full computer game, but nowadays video games have evolved. The book is a timeless classic, one that can be picked up and played - it is, as I said, for everyone. But it also is not long on the PC, you quickly go through everything and everything is automatically taken care of, no writing down stats etc manually. It is probably the best you can ask for to bring this to the PC, but it feels different. Maybe because I'm older, maybe because sitting with a book and paper, trying to draw an own map while going through the book, feels different. All in all you get what you pay for: A text adventure RPG from the master of its craft, 30 years late.\n\nI hope that in 150 years, just like Moby ♥♥♥♥,* just like Pride and Prejudice, this is a classic that very few ever read but everyone knows about. In fact, it already is today to the lovers of such books. In a tight genre like this, almost everything is a classic. But on the PC it is too casual, something that does not hold the same impact anymore as it did when it came out first. For PC games, this one will never be, it is two or three decades too late. If text adventures - not just interactive fiction but real text adventures - would become resurrected, this would be how they could be made easier but still accessible. But they would need to be much longer, that is why I can only recommend the small price. They would need to be epics, things that tell long stories. This one, as much as it hurts, is a typical fantasy setting, something so cliché that it will be forgotten and only the gameplay is what stays in the head.\n\n* = That book with the Whale by Herman Melville, not some guy named Moby's genital. Just so you know what word was censored. :-)","January 26, 2015","true","1.1"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","24","26","0","4"

Where do I start?  The music is decent - not my cup of tea, though some may enjoy it (it's certainly thematic).  All of the old artwork has been not only retained, but enhanced with color, and (in the case of the main menu screen, and perhaps others I haven't seen yet) subtle animation.  The parchment-style rendering of the text is a nice touch.\n\nThe interface is easy to use, and the creators understand their users.  The game supports the use of unlimited bookmarks to simulate how you used your fingers back in the old days!  The graphics and sound effects further enhance the atmosphere of the game, although they aren't obtrusive on what is simply a text-based game.  The game comes with extras written by co-creator Ian Livingstone himself, about the history of Fighting Fantasy and the creation of Forest of Doom.\n\nAnyway, I appreciate the TLC that Tin Man and Livingstone brought to the project.  I hope this makes enough money that we see more of these.  I can't wait until Deathtrap Dungeon, Freeway Fighter, and other alliterative titles are released!  Also, the Sorcery! series...keep em coming, guys.","November 1, 2014","true","1.8"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","0"

It is just more like reading the book, but you choose what the hero does. So basically you read short chapters and make a decision what to do. For example to hide in the bushes or to wait on the middle of the road. There are also many fights based on very simple mechanics and there are few statistics.\nI played such book-games when I was a kid so I knew what to expect. And I got it here: simple story in typical fantasy world. Total old-school.\n\nVERDICT:\nIf you have played such games many years before, try this and remind how it was to be a kid.\nIf you have never played such games but you like to read books, you should try that, this will combine both your hobbies: reading and playing games.\nIf you expect of games only good graphics and animations, go and play Diablo instead of this.\n\nLike this review?

Playing the game was both a nostalgic delight and a fun, exciting interactive experience slightly reminiscent of playing "Citadel of Chaos" on the C64 many years ago.\n\nTinMan Games have done a fantastic job of reproducing Ian Livingstone's classic extremely faithfully; I was able to find my old maps and utilise them to complete the game in around an hour. Combat rolls are represented with actual dice; white for the player and red for the monsters, enabling a quickly understood and resolved outcome. The musical track is suitably atmospheric and doesn't outlive its welcome.\n\nI very much like the inclusion of a "Hardcore mode" for experienced players where no provisions are allowed and initial player statistic rolls are lessened. (You get only 1d6+4 for your skill stat for example...) this added a dimension of challenge to a familiar story. However, amusingly I ran into a bug at the encounter with "Quin the Arm-Wrestler" and found myself with 68 stamina going into the next encounters, which trivialised reaching the conclusion of the book.\n\nIt was a pleasure to support the developers and I look forward to seeing more of their work.\nRecommended to Gamebook, Fighting Fantasy fans and those looking for an interactive reading and single player role-playing  experience.","October 31, 2014","true","2.6"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

I loved the good old series fighting fantasy books by livingstone, however, I feel the devs have chosen a really poor book to begin with as the writing is too simplistic and predictable. Warlock of firetop mountain was always one of the favorites among fans of these books and would've captivated many more people than what this forest of doom could, deathtrap dungeon, even city of thieves.\n\nThe game uses unity engine which seems unecessary, adds very little originality to the book it is based on, illustrations are low res, theres very little content for its price tag, and the music is absolutely godawful. The music was an extreme annoyance to me as I was trying to read the book and concentrate on the narrative when the music is just blaring trumpets into my ears, I had to mute the music because it never stopped being loud.\n\nI think if the devs put some thought into this game and think about how they can bring an old adventure book into the attention of modern pc gamers, they could achieve delivering a great experience to their customers. Also, warlock of firetop mountain is just a much better story.\n\nHowever, if you;re looking for a game based on an adventure book then I would recommend looking at Joe Dever's Lone Wolf game which is also on steam for a similar price but is considerably superior.","June 12, 2015","false","0.9"," 33 of 50 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","33","50","2","4"

Livingstone wrote a great many other books following the same formula, such as The Caverns of the Snow Witch (also available in a PC game format). Forest of Doom will bring you back to the old school style RPGs in the style of Dungeons & Dragons; before the heavy mainstream success of computer and console gaming.\n\nBecause Forest of Doom is a book, it goes without saying that the game is primarily focused on reading and the imagination of the reader. However, it also contains quite beautiful (if not, detailed) illustrations of some of the situations the player will find himself in. Also, because the game has a decent amount of content and locations, a map of the world is provided for the reader's benefit.\n\nThe combat is dice-based as per most old school RPGs.

However, you are allowed to go wherever you want on the map in search of your goal (Part of the storyline) while also finding various other items that will help assist you in your quest.

Although you'll undoubtably have to play it through four or five times before you see everything, it's still a very short game with little content.  The creatures are stereotypical of this genre, but you must remember this is based on an old novel from the days of D&D.  We didn't have the crazy monsters which we have now.\n\nI'm not sure if the game is worth the money I paid, even if that amount was lower due to a Steam sale.  I expected this game to be as long as a Tolkien novel with thousands of different paths and events.  This is more like a single chapter.\n\nIn the end, I do recommend it for a quick play through, but wish I had referenced the game before purchasing.

Does THIS bring back some memories!  Both good and, er, sometimes a bit more ambivalent...\n\nFirst up, I will say that this is a sterling ADAPTATION.  If ye be a die-hard fan of the original gamebook, I can't imagine you'll have any complaints about the way it's been handled here, bar perhaps the fact that it's no longer comprised of paper and now has some (reasonably spiffy) music to go along with it.  Any and all "problems" with this game, then, lie plainly and simply with the design of the original gamebook itself which, like so many other FF titles, relies kind of heavily on you being fortunate enough to follow the correct path through sheer blind LUCK and little else; in other words, expect to have to play it over and over again before you successfully complete the ♥♥♥♥er.\n\nHaving said that, a single playthrough is pretty short (a couple of hours, tops, depending on how slowly you read), and in all fairness the game design is very DELIBERATE, as opposed to blind, blithering ineptitude.  It just depends on how much this style of "here we go again..." design/structure appeals to you as a player, and I have to say I agree with another Steam reviewer who says that he preferred the FF books where you simply had to "get to the end", as opposed to "acquire these specific items along the way and THEN get to the end", and tough ♥♥♥♥♥ if you happen to go east rather than west when you're given a completely random, fifty-fifty choice along the way.  Trial-and-error is pretty much the name of the game here.  It also doesn't hurt to have some good statistical rolls at the very beginning of the game; you really may as well just go back and re-roll everything if you roll naught but ♥♥♥♥♥, 'cause you AIN'T gonna get too far, buddy boy...\n\nAll these reservations aside, I'm definitely looking forward to more Fighting Fantasy books turning up on Steam...just don't be an eejit and pay the full asking price of ten bucks, 'cause you already know full well that it isn't worth THAT kind of money.  Sales, kids, sales...\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10.","December 26, 2014","true","2.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

A so-called “fighting fantasy” book, as you progress through it you\n\n[center][size=2em]The Forest of Doom[/size]\n[img]http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/270490/header.jpg?t=1416291745[/img][/center]\nChoose Your Own Adventure, Adventure\n\nYOU are the hero in Forest of Doom! Explore the sinister Darkwood Forest in Ian Livingstone's Fighting Fantasy classic RPG gamebook!\nA choose your own adventure book from the 1980s, this book was designed to introduce children to roleplaying. It is, quite frankly, awful. But why is it so bad?\n\nThe book starts off with random stat generation – which means that you can have wildly varying statistics. That’s right, in this choose your own adventure book, the outcome of combat events (and a few other events) is randomized using 2d6 plus a stat bonus, and you take damage. The combat system is very simple and incredibly boring because there are no real choices to be made – you either fight or flee every round, and there’s really nothing more to it than that. It is all randomized, without any meaningful input on the player’s part, thus making it rather pointless – if you have good stats, you’ll win all your combat encounters, and if you don’t, you’ll probably die.\n\nFrom that point, you then head off on your adventure. You promptly run into a dying dwarf named Bigleg, who entrusts you with the task of finding the two halves of a hammer in a forest and bringing them to the dwarves, so that they can beat some trolls who are attacking them.\n\nYou then promptly end up on the front porch of a wizard, which you have 30 gold pieces to buy a large amount of equipment from. Yes, that’s right, you have an inventory in this game… and you have to buy equipment blind, as it is only useful in specific encounters, and you have absolutely no way whatsoever of knowing which encounters those are or whether or not you will encounter them.\n\nThat’s right – trial and error gameplay. And it isn’t even the worst form of it.\n\nThe second, and even worse form of trial and error gameplay is when you have purchased your equipment, you are given the choice of going west or going east.\n\nIf you go west at the start, you have absolutely no way of succeeding in your quest, as you will miss one of the hammer pieces, get to the end, and have to start over, because there is absolutely no way to backtrack in this game – you must always go north, west, or east, and can never go back to a previously visited location. If you miss one of the two hammer pieces, which are distributed in the woods in places that you may well not even run across, you will have to start the whole thing over to find them.\n\nThis is incredibly obnoxious – you choose your path more or less blindly, and one of the pieces requires two specific items which can only be found in specific encounters which you may well not run across. Worse still, it isn’t even good storytelling, and means you’re going to have to run through the book at least twice, if not more, at an hour plus per run through, to figure out how to beat it.\n\nAnd what do you get for finding the two parts of the hammer and completing your quest? A helmet worth “hundreds of gold pieces” and wealth beyond your wildest dreams. You don’t help the dwarves fight the trolls; the story just ends at that point.\n\nSuch poor storytelling is endemic to the work; the entirety of the adventure feels incredibly random and eclectic, like they just randomly picked monsters out of a D&D monster manual and distributed them into the forest. Almost all of the choices you make are made blind, and you have no reasonable idea whether putting on a ring is going to give you a permanent bonus or a permanent penalty. There is no rhyme or reason to the adventure, and none of it really feels connected or satisfying.\n\nEven the quality of the prose is pretty questionable; the writing feels amateurish, more like what a DM might write for exposition for an adventure on the spur of the moment, not a well thought-out work of coherent fiction.\n\nThere are better, absolutely free choose your own adventure books produced by random people on the Internet than this book, and frankly, even if there weren’t, this wouldn’t be worth your time – any video game or any real novel would be a better use of your money and effort.\n","January 11, 2015","false","1.9"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","15","28","2","3"

This book was one of my favourite ones in the childhood (along with Starship Traveller), although I had the semi-official edition translated to my native language.\n\nThis is a dark fantasy text adventure. The original game book did the job, it captured your attention and hooked you to the end. The same pretty much goes for adaptation. Although I'd recommend to play it on your tablet rather on Steam.\n\nWhat can be said about the port?\n\nIt's a very direct port from mobile, it was created for tablets / phones and it shows pretty much. You never get an explanation for controls or how to change things. Which got me confused at first, Escape button exits the game to main menu and it's not obvious what you need to move your mouse cursor outside the screen to show GUI.\nThere's a Unity default launcher which lets you choose resolution and quality and in-game options, where you can choose font and its size. You can also change the game to “Retro Look” (black text on the white background + original b/w illustrations), change dice settings, turn off Sound or Music (no volume sliders). I'd recommend turning off music, because it can be very distracting, at least it was for me. Quite epic tunes which don't really fit the reading at all.\n\nAdventure sheet updates itself (well, obviously) and you also have the map which tracks your progress (great addition). You place virtual bookmarks to save your progress.\nYou get the achievements for things like unique encounters and there's a gallery where you can see illustrations what you unlocked during the game.\n\nIf you ever wanted a videogame adaptation of Forest of Doom to play on your PC, then here it is.","February 9","true","5.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I bought, played, and beat the game in 2 hours.  I went through most all of the forest, and because there is no random features of the game there is no replayability.\n\nThere are some titles that are similar; in that once you play and beat them then that's it.  However, they are usually much higher quality games, with MUCH more development, and range from 20 to 50 USD.  You tend to get MUCH more for your money out of these games.\n\nNow, for the merits of the game itself, ignoring the crazy price tag, it is very simplistic, and the choices to make are very obvious, at least for myself.  I also dislike the game making choices for me.  If I want to backtrack I should have that choice.  I felt like there was a DM telling me what I HAD to do.\n\nThere was no figuring out uses for items either.  If it was usable it came up in conversation, leaving you a little less to think about.  That just made the game even more boring.\n\nThe game description made it sound more survival based, but food and water really had nothing to do with the game at all.\n\nIf you are into story games then perhaps this is for you.  However, I don't suggest spending more than 2 dollars on this game, perhaps just 99 cents.  Considering the 100s of hours you can get out of 50 USD games, or the 1000s you can get out of certain free games (e.g. Dota 2) I think their price at 10 USD is overpriced except for that very very niche crowd that are fanatical about these games.","April 2, 2015","false","1.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/270490/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","Forest of Doom, developed by Tin Man Games, puts you into the roll of an adventurer who has adventure thrusted upon you. You are just camping, minding your own business, when someone comes to you, gravely injured, and puts you on a quest to put together a hammer that will save a town. The only problem is that you don't know where it is, and you are going to have to journey through an area called the Forest of Doom to try to recover it. This is an interactive choose your own adventure game, where you will have to be careful, but bold if you are going to be able to get through this game. You will have skill, stamina, and luck to help get you through the game, but know this, if they run out, you are doomed to die within these very woods.\n\nGraphically you are not going to see too much in this game, it truly is a choose your own adventure, so the vast majority of the game is centered around text. There will be some times when you get to see a still show of the enemy you will be facing, but the majority of this adventure is ruled by text and the rolling of dice. I have to say that the animations for the die rolling is very realistic, but the collision on the dice from time to time was a bit too much as they violently shook off of each other because they were touching ever so slightly.\n\nThe music definitely gives you that midieval adventure feel to it, and the only sound that you're really going to hear, other than the sounds of the forest from time to time, is when damage is being taken.\n\nThe controls in this game, as you can imagine consist of clicking on your decision, lets hope that its the right one, too many wrong decisions and the end of the game will creep up on you fast.\n\nSo this is actually one of those times where its really hard to talk about the game, without really giving too much away, but I'm going to try. This is definitely not an easy game, and you kind of need to keep track of what directions you are taking so that you don't accidentally move too fast through the forest. Let's just say you want to explore all you can, and hopefully survive, so that the ending that you seek is actually obtainable. You are going to rely HEAVILY on your skill to hit, your stamina are your life points, and luck should ONLY be used to get you out of deadly experiences. You may have the option to use it in combat, but if you are not down to your last stamina points don't waste them. Now this game does feature a go back a page feature, so if you make a wrong decision, you can sometimes erase it in the blink of an eye.\n\nThis is a challenging game, and really should be attempted by those who aren't afraid of going through the game a couple of times, trying different things, to figure out what you need to do, and where you need to go. If you are able to do that, and you want a twist of pencil and paper RPG thrown in there, then you are going to enjoy this game. I will fully admit I've definitely had some high levels of frustration, but its only because sometimes I try too many different things during a playthrough and end up in a worse spot than I was last time.\n\nWhen everything is all said and done, this is definitely the type of adventure one would take in a pencil and paper setting, and the writing is pretty solid. If you are up for lots of reading, you are going to find a game that you can get into. So with that being said I'm going to have to give this game an 8.1 out of 10.","December 1, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Without that holy weapon, the Darkwood dwarf king will lack the power to remedy internal conflicts and gather enough force against his enemies, and his people will perish. But it was stolen by the goblins who live in the forest, and you must track them down and retrieve the artifact.\n\nYour quest gets even more complicated when you find out that the hammer has been divided in two and scattered over the dangerous Darkwood forest. The head is now separated from the handle, and you have to explore the whole forest trying to gather both parts together again.\n\nThat's how our adventure begins. Granted, the story doesn't sound that great, but the book is more about playing a game than enjoying finicky pieces of literature. You'll pass most of the time trying your luck against traps and such, chosing directions and rolling dice for damage.\n\nBy the way, The Forest of Doom isn't particularly hard, the enemies are not much of a challenge, and that hurts the gamebook a little. But it's still fun fighting through nonetheless, since the colorful variety of characters and explorable locations make up for it.\n\nAs a rule, the hero can't go back to where he came from without cheating (activated on Free Read difficulty), save for some rare occasions, which reinforces the rogue-like aspect even more. Some are annoyed by that, but it extends the replayability a nice bit.\n\nThere's also an option, for those interested, to completely ruin the game (specially when it comes to Forest of Doom) in the way of bookmarks, that work like the regular save from video game RPGs, but one can do oneself a favor by ignoring that, so that's not much of an issue.\n\nAll in all, if you're lacking an excuse to sip hot sweet coffee or some bitter tea to, while sitting on your reading chair on a rainy weekend afternoon, waving a pen away on blank sheets or just throwing some virtual dice, this could well be it.\n\nWho knows, you could even end up fooling your relatives or spouses, passing for a diligent student in their eyes.","March 22, 2015","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great for a quick play, or for those who just don't want to deal with the paper, dice, and pencils.\n\nThis is pretty much a 100% accurate recreation, but with added options that can either spice up your experience if you're a veteran of the Fighting Fantasy series, or ease the pain and suffering that awaits you in Darkwood Forest by allowing you to place bookmarks and retrace your steps (aka, make quicksaves).\nAnother huge benefit is a map that completes itself as you play, so you can more easily keep track of where you have and haven't been!\n\nIf you don't like reading, and/or are looking for an action packed adventure, this might not be the game for you.

You can complete it in just one afternoon, although it will be a very enjoyable afternoon.\nHopefully the next titles will be longer.\nSecondly, like in the original Fighting Fantasy games, your success in the mission depends on your choices, you will need to do certain specific things, otherwise you will fail, so it is important to explore.\n\nFinal words; Short and Sweet and Nostalgic!","June 25, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You read paragraphs and then fight monsters or make decisions by picking from a list of options to see where you go next. It's exactly like the corresponding Fighting Fantasy gamebook, except that the computer takes care of the dice-rolling and inventory-tracking for you.\n\nIt's about as well-executed and well-implemented as you'd expect, but it suffers from the same problem that the Fighting Fantasy books frequently did: there is only a SINGLE successful path through the story, and it's not an intuitive one. There is a list of items you MUST find, the list is LONG, and they're scattered throughout the map ... and you cannot backtrack, so anything you miss is gone forever. On Andrew Plotkin's Cruelty of Interactive Fiction scale, the Fighting Fantasy series is off the bottom of the scale, qualifying for a "Hell" rating.\n\nIf this doesn't bother you, like if you grew up with the Fighting Fantasy books or just don't care about failing repeatedly without ever knowing the reason why, then this is a great implementation with a terrific UI. Hence, I'm recommending it. But if you're used to series like Lone Wolf that are a lot more forgiving, with multiple possible solutions, this series will provide a BRUTAL wake-up call.","May 1, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoctorTeo/recommended/270490/","DoctorTeo","Doctor Teo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoctorTeo/","613 products in account","A very interesting concept for a game that I wasn't aware of: a pen'n'paper RPG where the computer does all the busy note taking and map creation while the player is free to explore and make choices. A great concept, but very roughly executed.\n\nThe player rolls for stats at the start of the game, given a couple supplies, and then told to go on out and make a bunch of decisions that will eventually save the land. At first it's kind of fun - you get to go out with a character (generated by dice rolls) to face a bunch of unknown events, having to make decisions that may or may not end up backfiring, etc.\n\nHowever, the game has several glaring flaws. First, many of the choices made (including the items purchased at the start of the game) are uneducated choices - there is no way to tell if or when an item will be useful or what the outcome of a decision will be, making the entire ordeal less about good judgement or morality and instead being about trial-and-error. The second, and most significant flaw, is that it is possible (and very easy) to set oneself into an unwinnable game state as soon as the very first choice of where to go; I restarted at least five times before I realized 'going west' resulted in the game eventually turning into an auto-loss ten minutes later. Come on, this is 2015, any game that is made unwinnable in the first minute like in Shadow of the Beast should be extinct by now.\n\nMinor gripes include the RNG nature of the dice roles at the start, the lack of good music, and the story's a bit uninspired as well; I can see the story being bare bones in order to allow the player to use their own imagination, but after the third playthrough, frustration begins to overcome imagination.\n\nI really like the concept for this game and I hope the author tries again, but as it stands, this game isn't worth the time, even if it was free.","October 4, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/legionnaireloki/recommended/270490/","legionnaireloki","Yaztromo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/legionnaireloki/","2392 products in account","So, I wrote a negative review for Appointment with F.E.A.R. (another Fighting Fantasy gamebook converted into a game), lambasting it for its frustrating "only one path to win", among other things. And yet I am about to praise Forest of Doom, even though it has the same thing. All the FF books did. Why am I fond of this, but not the other?\nFirst off - to address lack of playtime, this is like having played a drm free version (the original book) for many, many hours, before getting it on Steam. I have known and loved this book since I was a kid. And this is exactly what I dreamed of since then.\nMy biggest issue with Appointment was the slick graphics, neat interface, collectibles ... Going into it had a sense of OK, this is all new and shiny; maybe this means they have addressed some of the imbalance of the original book.  No. No, they did not. It was still the same unwieldy beast, wearing new clothes.\nForest of Doom also stays true to the original source material, and it looks like it. The layout is a virtual book, and as you navigate the adventure, you are presented with the classic options (ie, If you wish to go North, turn to 365. If you wish to go East, turn to 260) When you get into combat, need to Test Your Luck, etc, you click to roll the dice, which tumble across the screen. And if you make it to the end and only have one of the two items you need to win, you can Test Your Luck and maybe make it back to the beginning to try again. Just like the book. I expected nothing but nostalgia, and that is exactly what it served. This is not to say it is ugly, by any means - it looks great. In fact, I think it is all the more attractive for taking a classic and translating it directly, instead of adding fancy window dressing. It also avoids one of the most annoying mistakes both the book and game version of Appointment with F.E.A.R. (and some other FF books) make by not forcing you down a cul-de-sac of fail at the end, and making you sit through it. Failure is swift and relatively painless, and there is that (possibly unique) option to 'escape' back to 1.\nThis is FF at its best, presented beautifully and faithfully. If you are unfamiliar with Fighting Fantasy, think of a choose-your-own-adventure book with a solid fantasy theme, add some barebones RPG elements (Skill, Stamina and Luck, as well as inventory / usable objects, and combat) and prepare to roll a lot of dice. If you are familiar, you know you want this.","December 14, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am highly looking forward to others being converted in this manner. I've still got a lot of fighting fantasy books including this one and it was not only a nice nostalgia hit but a new fun way to bring reading back into video gaming where it's a cross between a digital comic book and interactive point & click adventure.\n\nDefinitely limited in its scope but simple and fun. The music is well suited and cheat option is also good fun when I remember back to my childhood and hold I'd bookmark pages with my fingers just in case I made a wrong mistake.\n\nVery keen to see the entire Sorcery series adapted the same way. Worth the price and double so if you read the original books.","May 30","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
