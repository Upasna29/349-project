"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mortimermcmire/recommended/358220/","mortimermcmire","zyber lame-o","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mortimermcmire/","1007 products in account","==In options set the sound to "Digital Lo" for correct output==\n\nThis is one of the best games in the 3D Realms Anthology.\n\nI've played this many times over the years, and while yes this recommendation has a fair bit of nostalgia behind it, I would not recommend many of the other Anthology games the same way I recommend Mystic Towers.\n\nYou're an old wizard and your goal is to destroy the monster generators in 12 towers, along with all the monsters. BUT you have a piddly amount of health. AND you have to eat and drink to survive. AND if you want to kill monsters within the next century, you have to conserve your consumable spells. This game is tough. It was tough for 10 year old me when I bought it and it's just as tough now.\n\nYou move in an isometric grid, the game is real time and has you moving through rooms of a tower. The levels are not randomzied which thankfully allows some strategy when approaching each one. Monsters roam throughout the rooms however, making it a bit more complex. There are a variety of spells, most of them are damage spells, there's a healing spell, a teleport spell (only between set teleport points), a levitation spell, a reveal spell, and a bomb spell (used to destroy monster generators). The meat of the game is finding the best ways to kill monsters from across the room without them eating you. Because monsters are moving constantly, the worst feeling in this game is using your last lightning bolt only to have the monster move to the side. Wizarding ain't easy.\n\nYou can control it with a mouse if you really want to lose quickly, or use a keyboard. Best option is a gravis gamepad but if you own one you have probably played this before.\n\nWhat sets this game apart isn't the obtuse controls or (personally) insane difficulty. It's things like the sound and music. The noises enemies make as they attack you are ingrained in my mind forever. They're indescribable grinding screams. There is no tutorial level. As opposed to say, Commander Keen 4 where the first level is an upbeat village toon, the second you step foot in a tower an ominous tone plays and you realize you have no idea what's going on.\n\nThe monster design is another huge part. Sure you have your basic spider, you have a dragon, you have a floating goat head with spinning knives, you have your three legged earthworm, your classic steam powered single-wheeled lizard robot. But there's also fun monsters like ghosts and other things I can't even describe without sounding even weirder.\n\nYou can get drunk in this game and fart and spin around and make happy noises in the middle of a dungeon.\n\nThis game is great. Even if you turn it on for only ten minutes and die to a snake wearing its hood as a dress, you'll have a good time doing it.","December 17, 2015","true","0.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

Mystic Towers,  ah what a masterpiece.  I used to play this game so much as a kid,  and you know,  there weren't many games at the time that I could say that about.  This one draws you in all easy;  the first tower is a push-over.  Then comes the second tower; you need to do a little thinking in this one.  By the third tower,  you are at wits end; never knowing which corner a monster will be,  never sure of where the next bit of food might be laying in order to save the rest of your starving, dragged out,  now poisoned body.  This game is worth the price tag,  and if you have the reflexes and brains to get to the last tower,  I will personally mail you a delicious loaf of stale, pixelated tower bread.  Stay retro my friends.","October 4, 2015","true","7.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

Never knew it was an Australian made franchise.  Too bad about the emulation though because the audio was comical and the soundtrack was pretty catchy, at least being DOSBox that can be corrected.  Definitely worth picking the 3DR Anthology package though!","August 12, 2015","true","0.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

(yes, I'm serious)\n* Interface is clunky compared to modern games.\n* Audio is scratchy. (it was in the original too)\n* Game lacks depth/mechanics compared to modern games.\n\nPros:\n* I played it when I was young and enjoyed it. Now I'm doing it again.","August 10, 2015","true","1.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"
