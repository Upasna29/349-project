For a first look if you only check a video you think it's something like Luxor or Zuma, but no, its more than that games. A game follows a Puzzle Quest idea. A gameplay enough simple, you should match 3 or more marble to get some effect. Different colored marble has different effects for example damage, heal, shield, damage boost etc. If you do good combination at you can reach in same time more than one effect. The game has a lot of levels, so it’s can keep your attention for enough long time. Also after beat a level you get a points what you can use for upgrade your hero. The game has a simple and linear story, but this completed with good art and music.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+many levels\n+simple and enjoyable gameplay\n+nice graphic style\n+RPG elements\n+steam achievements and trading cards\n\n-sometimes you need be lucky\n-a bit linear\n\n8/10\nSo if don't know what you want do, it’s can be good time killer for you, also while you play you can a bit relax. Also this can be good game for children, because with this game they can learn some logical thinking.","December 4, 2015","true","4.7"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","22","29","0","0"

The object of each level is to match red orbs to deal damage to your opponent. Some levels have a trick to them, like different enemy behavior (whether they'll focus on damage or defense, for example), or not giving you any red orbs, so you can only deal damage by setting up combos with other colors. Cute art and story, as well. Overall a fun, memorable game that stands out in its genre.\n\nNote: originally released as Evy: Magic Spheres. I'm not sure what has been changed for this release (other than the bonus winter levels), but this is a much better title anyway.","January 15","true","6.3"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/338120/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3936 products in account","Marble Duel is a match-three game where you follow the story of the orphan girl Evy who finds herself caught up in a world of magic.\n\nIf you're familiar with Luxor or Zuma then you'll feel right at home playing Marble Duel, if not then don't worry too much as the gameplay is very quick to learn.\n\nThere are two main features that separate Marble Duel from Luxor and other games inspired by it, firstly is that Marble Duel faces you off against AI opponents every round and your goal is to beat them rather than amass points. Secondly the game play is turn based so rather than a continual flow of spheres, you take turns against your opponents. This makes playing a little more relaxing as you are not rushing against anything. Instead of the clock causing difficulty you have an AI. The aim of each mission is simply to reduce the health of your enemy to zero.\n\nYou start with just one sphere: the red sphere. This will allow you to match three reds with each other to deal damage to your opponent and once his health hits 0, you win. Though you only have one colour starting sphere this will quickly change; as you advance through levels you'll unlock a variety of different coloured spheres. These include blue spheres for defence (blocks a percentage of damage), green for life (heals an amount of your health), purple for attack damage (gives your next attack extra damage) and yellow for attack deflection (sends a percentage of the damage you take back to your opponent). There are also white spheres which don't seem to do anything but block matches and black spheres which deal damage to whoever matches three of them together, though you cannot fire either of these spheres yourself.\n\nWhen you complete a mission you are awarded with gems which can be spent to upgrade your various spheres and your health. Each stage can be completed in a set number of turns to earn yourself gold, silver or bronze stars which will reap you more gems and consequentially more upgrades. Once a stage is completed it can be revisited at any time to earn any bonus stars you missed and this can be very helpful if you're struggling with later levels because your stats aren't high enough. The stage will remain the same difficulty and chances are you'll have upgraded your stats by then making the stage easy to complete within the allotted turns. It's worth trying to get as many stars as possible as the stats of your opponents will increase over time and you'll need plenty of upgrades to fairly compete. You can view your opponents stats before entering each level allowing you to reset and redistribute your own if you see fit.\n\nThe only thing I could see some people not enjoying about this game is the story. Whilst I enjoyed it I think a lot of people would skip it as it isn't pivotal to the gameplay at all and is a little thin at times. That being said the story itself is pretty cute and I rather liked helping Evy fight her way through a whole world she didn't mean to get involved in. The characters are enjoyable and the dialogue is fun.\n\nSo far I've sunk many hours into Marble Duel and I know I'll be playing it a lot more. The relaxing gameplay and wonderful art style makes for a great experience and I think any casual gamer or Luxor fan should give this one a try as they won't be disappointed.","April 25","true","16.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/recommended/338120/","dpxmsk","DeadPoolX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/","1182 products in account","Marble Duel is mess of a game that should've stayed on mobile platforms, or at least, been properly rebalanced for PC gaming.\n\nBefore I launch into everything that's bad about this game (and there's LOTS to say about that!), let me give you some background on Marble Duel.\n\nOriginally, the game was called Evy: Magic Spheres and sold on mobile platforms, as well as Desura. When coming to Steam, the name was changed to Marble Duel. Personally, I think the old name sounds better, as the current title reminds me of Marble Madness, which is nothing like this game at all.\n\nMarble Duel looks similar to games like Luxor or Zuma, but it plays very differently. You need to match three or more colors to do something (e.g. damage the enemy, raise shields on yourself, heal yourself, or increase your attack power), but unlike those two other games, Marble Duel is turn-based as opposed to real-time action.\n\nThe goal is simple: kill your opponent before they kill you. During the game, you'll be able to increase your skills, which directly translates to differently colored marbles. You can respec at any time, so if you put points into something you don't need much, it's easy to fix.\n\nThe graphics are entirely 2D and the artwork for the cutscenes are passable. The audio is okay, but I prefer it turned off so I can play my own music.\n\nThe story is utterly forgettable and more a nuisance than anything else. In this sort of puzzle game, I'm far less interested in the storyline (especially when it's written so poorly) than I am in actual gameplay.\n\nNow the bad stuff... yeah, what I wrote up above is what I'd consider the "good" part of Marble Duel.\n\nThe developer KNOWINGLY placed false screenshots on the store. His response to this when someone on the boards called him out on it was this: "Well, t'would be awfully hard to explain what's actually going on in the game without those graphic additions."\n\nIn other words, the developer doesn't really care that he use false imagery to sell his product.\n\nBecause Marble Duel was designed with mobile games in mind, the game was balanced for in-app purchases. Fortunately, the developer removed those before putting it on Steam, but in the process, failed to rebalance the game as well. That means the game's difficulty is such that it expects you to purchase gems or coins (or whatever stupid in-game currency was used in the mobile version) and without that feature, Marble Duel quickly becomes so difficult that it's impossible to play.\n\nHere are three examples:\n\n1. When playing the game, the line of marbles extends off the screen and wraps around elsewhere. The AI can apparently "see" what's off screen and can make moves based on that knowledge. The player, however, cannot see off screen and is therefore at a disadvantage.\n\n2. Which marbles you get to shoot and match is randomized. That's supposed to be part of the strategy in learning to make moves with future moves in-mind. Unfortunately, the AI will ALWAYS receive whatever marbles it needs to make a move. If the AI needs a red marble or a green marble, it will get them, whereas the player will have to rely on pure chance.\n\n3. I've played one stage over 60 times (and lost each time) where if I win, I get a new amulet with bonus health. The problem is the AI starts with huge advantages over me. The AI has 400 HP, and can make THREE turns each round. In contrast, the highest my health can be right now (with all available points redistributed to my health stat) is 80 HP, and each round I get TWO turns.\n\nAll in all, I'd strongly suggest staying away from Marble Duel. If I could get a refund, I would, but I've played more than two hours worth of the game.\n\nIf you're desperate for a puzzle game, go elsewhere, as there are tons of them on Steam. If you're deadset on getting Marble Duel, wait for a sale. I know the normal price is $4.99 USD, but I'd seriously recommend holding off until the price is $1 or less. Even then, the frustration you'll feel when playing may not be worth it.","March 30","false","12.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

All of my developer sponsored reviews are positive because I pick the good ones\n═══════════════════════════════════\nOVERVIEW\n\nFairly simple gameplay concept, you shoot a marble at a chain and try to get matches of 3 or more. Different colored marble matches give different effects (heals, shields, damage, etc) and mastering usage and getting chains is crucial for getting past the harder levels. This game also features a fairy tale style story with beautiful illustrations with similarly inspired enemies. Beating levels quickly gets you star points which you can use to upgrade the heroine's stats (health, attack, defense, heal effectiveness) and adds some replay value as you may have to go back to earlier levels to upgrade your stats if you get stuck on one level.\n\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPROS & CONS\n\nPros:\nSimple, relaxing, casual gameplay\nBeautiful graphics\nUpgrade system\nSome replay value\n\nCons:\nMay feel repetitive after a while\nEnemies are repeated\nLuck is a small part of the game\n═══════════════════════════════════\nSUMMARY & FINAL RATING\n\nMarble Duel is a fun casual game and accomplishes its purpose.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/338120/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2003 products in account","Product received for free\n\nMarble Duel is a matching game in which you play as Evy, a little girl which in the middle of the night steps inside a closet and finds herself in an unknown and fairy land. That said, having never played a game of this sort, I kind of went blind into this one.\n\nOne thing I noticed from the ground up was the fact that the options menu is extremely lacking. There is only the option to mute sound effects and music, no sliders to adjust the volume. As for the video options, the only thing you get is being able to choose what resolution you want to run the game on. For the type of game that is, maybe the only thing missing in video options would be v-sync and the ability to choose from windowed, windowed borderless and fullscreen. I was also kind of disappointed by the fact that the dialogue is not voice acted, even if there is little of it.\n\nIf you’ve played any matching games you’ll most likely feel at home with this one. The concept is pretty simple, you arrive at this fantasy land and you progress through various areas, each with their own monsters. These areas are composed of various levels, each one representing an encounter with one of the monsters or some sort of mini-game. The combat in these encounters is turn-based, in the sense that you shoot spheres that you have and then it’s the enemy turn. However, you only start with 2 spheres per turn but by matching several colors in a row, you can gain more spheres for that turn. Each sphere has its color, and each color has its own effect. Red allows you to attack, green heals you, blue gives you a shield that absorves damage, purple increases the strength of your next attack and yellow allows you to reflect a portion of damage dealt by the enemy. The key in each of these encounters is to deplete the enemy life bar, and while this might feel easy at first, as the game progresses and as more spheres come into play the difficulty will rise. That said, sometimes I felt like the AI was cheating, in the sense that it would get the sphere it needed at the right time.\n\nDepending on the amount of turns you take to beat a level you’ll be granted a bronze, silver or gold star. The better the star the more gems you’ll receive, and you can use these to upgrade your life, attack, healing and other abilities. If you want to get everything perfect, or if you get stuck on a level and need to upgrade your stats, you can replay previous levels. Still, you won’t gain more gems if you’ve already achieved that star rating previously.\n\nOverall, I feel like what makes Marble Duel really worth playing (if this is your type of game), is the fact that you have the whole time of the world to make your move in what is already a very casual, satisfying and pleasant matching game. It is even more engrossing if you’re one of those that wants to get a perfect score on all the levels. The story is there, but it is skippable, even if the characters are unique and if the dialogue is nicely put together.","May 9","true","6.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You'll find yourself trying to survive deadly combos, and repeating the same stage over and over and over again.\n\nThe game gives you points to distribute on your stats to increase the power of your marbles, but its also messed up, because every enemy needs a different strategy, and I had to keep reseting my points and distribute them in different ways for each stage.\n\nFor a casual game, it's too hard and boring.

I'm giving this game a 4.5/5, the music is nice and I absolutely love the graphics and artwork. The shadow shifting in between you turn and the enemies turn is a really nice touch. Each marble color represents a different skill or spell and the fewer turns you use to defeat you opponent the more gems you earn to upgrade different skills/marbles. There is no racing against the clock so you have time to think out your moves to try and get really good combos. So far the bonus rounds look scarier than they actually are and I wish random marbles would be dropped in or something to make it a little challenging.
