However it has many errors where no matter what you choose you end up in the same place. If you kill someone it plays out as if you just knock them out. It forces you down a singular path and some of the romances are impossible to get. no matter what you do some of the romances end very... badly and no matter what you do or how many times you run through it choosing different options it turns out the same. Honestly it promises more than it actually offers. I mean the game will actually crash if you choose the "wrong" answer. In other words it's not really worth the money.

Asumi gets send to Battle Academy to pose as a student and to find a terrorist named Raven.\nYou might think "An assassin posing as a student and gathering information during the day and following these leads (interrogating suspicious people, breaking into buildings, etc.) by night" doesn't sound that bad.\nBut sadly, the second Asumi steps onto campus, the terrorism plotline is shoved into the background and instead you get an extremely boring and shallow slice of life story including horrible romance subplots for about 90% of the game.\n\nWriting:\nEvery sentence itself seems ok but reading through the game, the writing just feels awkward and lifeless. Obviously, this also affects all the characters and their interactions which are just as boring and lifeless as the writing and I'm gonna skip the character point.\n\nArt:\nThere is an ok amount of variety in the backgrounds but they lack detail and just feel shallow. The character sprites are decently drawn but the characters posture often looks unnatural and awkward. The most effort however, was clearly put into the CGs. They are nicely drawn and overall just look good.\n\nOn a side note:\nWhy do so many OELVNs have such small character sprites? Half of the background is empty and it always seems like I'm standing about 10 meters away from all the other characters while talking to them. That just feels weird.\n\nSoundtrack:\nBesides maybe one track the OST is pretty generic but it didn't hurt my ears.\n\nOverall:\nThere are fragments of what this game could have been (CG art, story premise and even how the promised RPG system could be implemented) but in the end there are just too many major problems with story, characters and writing to be worth your time and money.","December 1, 2015","false","5.0"," 76 of 82 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","76","82","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BolverkGTM/recommended/326950/","BolverkGTM","BolverkGTM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BolverkGTM/","257 products in account","Sword of Asumi is a visual novel set in the Edo period...apparently.  I really didn't see any resemblence to the Edo period throughout the game, or any sign that the Edo period was still in effect.  They just say that it's the Edo period and according to web site descriptions, this is a timeline where the Edo period never ceased, so technically all of the advancements brought on by succeeding eras never should have happened.  I'm looking too much into this.\n\nAnyways, you play as Asumi, whom I can only describe as an awkward assassin with a very rare chronic stripping disorder.  At least that's the joke I make, because the writer thought it'd be a great idea to show her changing out of her clothes or laying around in excessive lingerie all of the time for no arbitrary reason.  The writer also thought it'd be a great idea to make the main character seduce a creepy, perverted principal instead of quietly sneaking into his office to get what she needed.  On that note, I should remark that they ruin this "highly trained" assassin character unbelievably fast and turn her into a cliche school girl that's so socially awkward, it's depressing.  Being able to blend in should be a part of your job as an assassin.\n\nThe writer also thought it'd be a great idea to make a martial arts centric visual novel without really having any understanding of martial arts at all.  As an example, I bring a quote from the narrative of the game, "Like lightning, Hikari slides to the side, raising his arms in a classic fighting stance ready to initiate a strong of blows."  First off, wow.  That was a thing that was written.  Second, a classic fighting stance?  Like what?  Be more specific.  Third, a strong of blows...what?\n\nThe writer also thought it'd be a great idea to present a main character who wants to become a Justicar, who can become one in the end of the game without really understanding the principles of being a Justicar.  Example, you can kill the hell out of the principal, indirectly causing tons of innocent murders, or you can kill a couple of innocents yourself.  Whatever tickles your fancy.  You still get to become a Justicar either way.  The writer also thought it'd be a great idea to make day time backgrounds, but not night time backgrounds for the same area.  Later in the game, characters will talk about it being night time when the background is clearly bright as day.  Near the end of the game, one of the day time backgrounds is blatantly lowered in brightness to "resemble" night time.  I am not kidding.\n\nThe writer also thought it'd be a great idea to present 2 love interests that could be completely uprooted from the game and have absolutely no impact on the story whatsoever.  With one of the routes I went, I encountered one of these love interest characters a net total of TWO times throughout the story.  One of which was optional.  The other love interest is simply there to play the best friend role.  She also happens to cosplay (EDO PERIOD) and at one point, can make Asumi cosplay as well.  Does this change anything in the main story?  No, not even in the slightest.\n\nIt was clear that the maker of the game knew his audience and I can't fault him for that, but at least give the game a bit more substance.  Draw in a bigger crowd than who you're obviously trying to bait into buying and liking this blatantly half-baked thing.  If you can't write any better, hire a writer!  Have someone else convey your words and story in a less embarrassing way.  I mean, you Kickstarted this game, so you had the funding.  Not sure where it went though...  Probably to the composer responsible for the absolutely maddening soundtrack of this game.\n\nSpeaking of Kickstarters, AJTilley (the maker of the game) recently started a Kickstarter for the sequel to Sword of Asumi (to my dismay).  He showed off some artwork that was already present on his website.  He also introduced a new character that is blatantly a near carbon copy of a character from a series that his target audience is probably very familiar with (Sinon from Sword Art Online).  Did he show anything else?  No, not really.  In fact, he canceled the Kickstarter a couple of weeks later, for the reason that he had ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for the sequel.  He wanted to Kickstart a game that he had absolutely nothing to show for.  The sad part is that it almost met half of its funding, with NOTHING to show for it.  Astounding.\n\nEnough of the Kickstarter though.  Back on the subject of this game.  It's not good.  The writing is pretty bad.  None of the characters were sold on me.  The story is excessively boring and a train wreck.  The game as a whole is a blatant bait for fanservice loving anime fans to buy the game and enjoy the main character changing into excessive lingerie that she just happens to be wearing under her regular clothing all of the time for no reason.  That's a great two word summary.  "No reason."\n\nWhy does this game exist?  No reason.\n\nWhy does the sequel want to exist?  No reason.\n\nWhy am I writing this review?  To express my befuddlement at the existence of this game and the fact that the person responsible for it tried to fund the sequel with absolutely nothing to present his 104 backers, who mindlessly funded it anyways.  But other than that?  No reason.\n\nI will revisit this game though...on a stream, while inebriated.  Why?  No reason.","April 16, 2015","false","10.1"," 75 of 89 people (84%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","84","75","89","13","6"

For the most part, the art is good. Well, average. However, it was drawn by someone with no concept of how breasts or non-neutral-standing poses work. First of all, the artist seems to think that protrusions from your body just... disappear if you put a cloak on (hint: they don't). Second, they also seem to think that t-shirts are skin. That they simply fold weirdly in some places but that they encase breasts perfectly (hint: they still don't).\nAnother complaint is that while normal scenes look acceptable and everything looks (almost) anatomically correct there... The special scenes (ones without separate and changing backgrounds/sprites, specially drawn for the occasion) have a different art style and don't look like they're drawn by someone with a whole lot of experience. The faces look odd in some way, the poses look awkward and like the artist didn't really do any sort of a research but just drew them straight. It's slobby. Particularly one scene comes to mind, with the induction party. Where Asumi's hand looks tiny and disfigured as she's clutching the oddly shaped little plastic cup. I can understand things not being perfect but that was... yeah... And the fact that the jumper was shaded incrediby weird, with breasts (again with the breasts!) having their own refractive properties that don't follow the rules of physics didn't exactly redeem that scene.\nAnd one more art-related thing. When you're outside at night time, the background is as bright and cheerful as ever. While the text is trying to create a creepy atmosphere, you're staring at a bright and sunny day in the park. Even something like a simple dark half-transparent overlay would work better than this. Seriously.\n\nPlot:  n...no. When I try to summarise the plot of the game for people who haven't played it, it does not come out well. "Asumi is this assassin and she's in a high school undercover in order to find this leader of a terrorist group, who's posing as a student for some reason. Oh, it's not just a regular high school. It's a high profile high school for samurai, very prestigious." If the plot was actually good, and there was reason for characters' actions then you could at least say "I know it sounds lame but it's actually really good". But you can't even do that. All characters are one-dimensional, you're pretty much forced into having some sort of a relationship with every one of them and then are forced to choose who to hang out with when you haven't even learned their names because they've been on screen once or twice. A lot of the actions and dialogue seem forced. The concept itself - of an assassin on a mission, undercover in a school, that needs to find out information on a certain person or people and then make deductions based on that information - is cool. It does have potential to be intriguing and fun. But you don't even get to do much deducing because...\n\nChoices:  The first choice you get is whether to kill/disable a maid (I'm assuming "disable" means "knock out" and not.. cause to become disabled). It's great when you get that. "Oh yay, this game has choices! I can see different sides of the story, there's replay value and all that crap" Then your choices get very limited. You pick which class you'll go to that day, you pick the answers to quizzes in classes (some of which you have NO WAY OF KNOWING without googling wtf), you get to pick whether to hang out with a character. but... you don't really get to do much research on your target. You don't pick what you say - there were times when I just watched, cringing, as Asumi straight up asked if someone knows who "Raven" is and pushed them about it. Wtf Asumi. Worst. Assassin. Ever. Some choices are also pretty forced.\nDon't get me wrong, it does have some sort of a replay value. Except it's the same replay value you'd get in a VN focused on just regular old school life and not, y'know, in a VN about an assassin on a mission.\nTo summarize   , buy this if you don't mind all those things but if you want quality content then save your money for something else.","September 7, 2015","false","4.7"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","40","43","4","0"

(Seriously, those kisses.)\n~ Decent amount of romances, though almost everyone is very one dimensional, it's very hard to get attached to any of the characters. (Hikari is best girl obviously. i'd've liked Minori and Kairi better but...they had no backstory to speak of.)\n~ Rebel terrorism plot is cool, but feels more of a subplot than anything. The real plot feels like it's the romances and watching Asami fumble her way through social situations, almost robotically, almost as if she's never talked to real people before. It's akward and a little cringey, tbh.\n\n- Short, even going for 100% only took me 2.6ish hours, can probably be done faster.\n- Typos, plenty of them.\n- Very little in the way of scene backgrounds, or character models, for anything/one that isn't vital to the story. There are characters that don't even get portraits, and the ones that do usually had one, maybe two.\n- The only replayability the game has is to eek out the two or three achievements you didn't get while doing your first playthrough. Almost every achievement can be gained on the first playthrough by save scumming.\n- Why did we need so many shots of Asami holding her boobs or standing aorund in her undies? We didn't. Really.\n- Whlie i'm on the subject of things we didn't need, that principal was disgusting. The only bright spot about it is you have the option to kill Him. (Why you would choose the other option is beyond me. Dude's really disgusting.) And then you have to go play nice with the widow to try to milk her for information about the shadowy group behind everything, and it turns out she knew but couldn't do anything because of aforementioned shadowy group. i'd've killed the pig myself, tbh.\n\nAll in all i give it a 5.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/326950/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Sword of Asumi is an embarrassment to itself. Not because it’s gross and exploitative, or because the art is horrendous, or because it seems to have been written by someone whose sole exposure to human interaction is anime. All of that is terrible in its own, agonizingly expansive way, but what is worst about Sword of Asumi is how little it tries to even pretend it’s anything but a pile of reeking ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThough its introduction says otherwise, Asumi and her narrative are as much about her life as an assassin as it is authentic in its portrayal of the Edo period (which in this universe is supposedly still in effect, despite absolutely nothing actually reflecting that). Sword of Asumi is instead then largely an excuse to strip down its constantly blushing cast (who unless I’m mistaken are also underage). The actual plot, impressively thin as it is, all takes place within the opening and closing five minutes of the game. The rest of the agonizing hour and a half or so is dedicated to carefully positioning the camera so as to best oggle your character while she inexplicably changes into dozens of outfits for the player’s enjoyment.\n\nI don’t know if Sword of Asumi was designed with softcore titillation as its main “feature”, or if that was just something the developer felt they had an obligation to include, but the lengths they have gone to expose and embarrass every female character in the game made me sick. It apparently wasn’t enough for them to stop at the typical ridiculously large breasts and vacuum sealed clothing that plagues anime and by extension visual novels. Even upon giving Asumi a wardrobe which consists almost entirely of lace lingerie (why is a teenage assassin suddenly wearing a garter belt?) and hav ing her lounge around in it as male classmates spontaneously barge into her room, the writer’s perverted aspirations remained unsatisfied.\n\nSo naturally the only thing left to do was create a subplot in which the principal of the school has been sexually assaulting first year students. And then have Asumi show up at his office wearing almost nothing, with the implication being she plans to offer herself up in exchange for information (which is never found, and which doesn’t matter in the end anyway). The scene is cut short before anything happens, but of course not before Asumi is stripped nearly naked and harassed by the principal (who is such a pointless character he wasn’t even given a portrait). It’s a disgusting, lazy plot device that goes nowhere and serves no function but to be another bullet point on Sword of Asumi’s list of exploitative tactics. I was legitimately flabbergasted then when the writer were able to make this subplot even worse, by bringing it up later on and painting the principal as a sympathetic victim of blackmail, in the process literally forgiving him of his crimes and going so far as to have Asumi feel sorry for him.\n\nI was prepared to dismiss Sword of Asumi as yet another poorly drawn, terribly written, abhorrently exploitative visual novel, but it went beyond rudimentary objectification to a degree that caused me to detest its very existence. I can’t even assume the writer has any idea what a sloppy piece of trash he has produced, because Sword of Asumi is so poorly constructed that it just feels like a bag of ideas and tropes pulled from the depths of anime hell to be reconstructed into something that could potentially be passed off as original. I can’t in good conscious actually call it original, but it’s definitely the product of a very particular, insular audience and the creators which spawn from it, a group I can only hope one day wakes up to the messes they’ve made.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","June 12, 2015","false","1.8"," 67 of 105 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","67","105","5","7"

I wish I could recommend this game because I actually sort of enjoyed playing it the first time. But I can't. Sword of Asumi is kind of a trainwreck.\n\nI mean, it's a visual novel/dating sim, which is fine by me, and I liked the art and the characters, though some of them are a bit bland. But a visual novel lives and dies on its writing, and in that area, Sword of Asumi is dead in the water. The initial plot idea is interesting- the game takes place in an alternate universe where Japan never moved out of its feudal phase, and samurai hold power. As an assassin-turned-samurai, your goal is to infiltrate a school where a rebel faction is plotting a terrorist attack. Sounds exciting, right? Well... no.\n\nThe game pretty much just follows Asumi as she fumbles her way through social life and classes at her new school. From its promising beginning, it becomes yet another school-centric dating sim, and the rebel plot hardly plays into the story at all until near the end. It's also almost pathetically easy to figure out who the culprits are if you're paying attention, and most of the classes and fight sequences require little to no effort. As well, the game advertises Asumi as a "strong female protagonist", but she's really bland and two dimensional and hardly uses her skills as an assassin at all. I was also pretty skeeved at the number of times the game put in shots of Asumi standing around in lingerie for fanservice's sake. Classy.\n\nAnd my god, the WRITING. All the dialogue in this game consists of awkward run-on sentences, numerous misspellings, and cliche lines. I'm no grammar freak, but reading this game made my head hurt.\n\nI do like the art, the music and the fact that the love interests include homosexual and heterosexual options. Though the romances suffer from the same problems as the rest of the game, they were probably my favorite part, even if they fell a little flat.\n\nSo, long story short: could have been good, isn't very good.

I got it in a bundle, and being honest, would not have otherwise picked it up - most especially not at that price (mainly because I've seen more polished and complete games set out for far less, more than any mispricing - no comment on that, since a person has the right to price their wares as much as they see fit). I perked up when I saw it was a visual novel, but things didn't really pick up from there.\n\nThe story and characters aren't anything special, and the choices to pick to steer the route a certain direction are as clear as day (you can probably get an ending with a person by solely ALWAYS picking the choice that their name appears in - aside from actually attending things they'd be at). The art has its own charm, but the very obvious and blatant fanservice seems to impact my opinion on the art as a whole (kudos to the artist for drawing that many different sets of underwear for one character, though - I do believe each day is a different racy matching set). That's not to say it wasn't good - I can appreciate the work and effort and the final output, even... it's just not to my personal taste, and there are things I think can be improved on.\n\nThere were a lot of bugs when I first played it - text where they shouldn't be, wrong labels and names, generally a lot of things that just outright confused me and threw me off - and there are still bugs. For one, Achievements on Macs were completely unresponsive before... supposedly, an update fixed it, but now my record of Achievements looks weirder since I got awarded for finishing certain routes (not all of them trigger their respective achievements) but NOT the Achievement for completing the game (for the first time). Achievements aren't usually necessary to begin with, but if you add them, do see to it that it works.\n\nStill, I will have to give props to the developer - there is serious work on spreading Sword of Asumi to mobile devices and any bugs that get reported get seen to. There is a strong developer presence in the forums, and new builds keep coming up trying to see to what problems people point out.\n\nKudos to that, I can really respect that.","May 7, 2015","false","3.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

I am probably approaching this game from the wrong angle, but I was lured into my expectations.\nFirst of all the preview and the intro lead me to believe it is going to be terrorist-hunting, secret plot-uncovering, "Tinker, tailor..." kind of a story. Well it's not. In fairness there is a terrorist, but our "Strong, Deadly, Female Protagonist" spends very little time looking for hir. Instead she is visiting pools, cosplays and blushes when anyone talks to her. She kills people for living, for heaven's sake, how can she be that shy? Long story short: it's a date sim with teeny-bit of a murder built in. The game does not even give us an opportunity NOT to try to start any relationship at the end.\nSpeaking of short stories: this one is extremely abrupt. It does feel fast-paced, especially if you consider the number of characters it introduces. The steadier development of a plot would have allowed the intrigue to unveil, but no, we have to deal two-week deadline and hence, the” brilliant” conclusions like “Orochi would choose to attend fighting classes, so this non-fighting chap is definitely innocent”. Are you willing to bet the Edo citizen’s lives on this, Asumi? How old are you?!\nBy the way… how old is she exactly? All kinds of frisky lingerie she is wearing would rather suit a woman than a schoolgirl, and yet our heroin blends in the Academy perfectly, age-wise.\nGranted, I might be harsh here, due to being caught off-guard. My limited experience of this genre consisted of “Long Live the Queen” and “Analogue: hate story”, both of which were brutal, dark and involving. So this wacky nonsense didn’t live up to the expectations.\nAll in all: if you are looking for an interesting plot, character’s development and a food for thoughts do keep looking somewhere else.

You're a new warrior for people living in Edo, finding out who the rebel in the samurai academy is.\n\nThe soundtrack was fantastic, lacking character building, didn't feel anything for the romance, it also was rather repeative and made it hard to replay through for the achievements.\n\nI can recommend this, even though I didn't find enjoyment in the rather small and not fanned out plot. It felt thrown together in some areas, the quick moving from "I like you, to I'm in love". The cosplay bit was cute, but a bit out of place and strange, it didn't lead to any understanding of the character or any development. It was a part that could be cut out and everything still make perfect sense. [Even though it's something you chose to do for romance with one of the characters] The artwork was pretty decent and would love to see more done with it, there isn't many VN's that dabble with anything historical [that I've seen, I'm a bit behind in the VN department] and it was nice to see done.\n\nI recommend based on the story wasn't HORRIBLE, sound track is fantastic, easy achievements and the game gave me a few giggles along the way.\n","April 1","true","9.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Though that's not enough to save you your ten dollars is it? You still want to buy it right now.... well let me get more in depth with you this is the introduction after all.\n\nGameplay: Sword of Asumi plays like your regular visual novel you read and occasionally make decisions that will effect you're outcome of the story. It's the same old same old with no other gameplay mechanic. Now yes the decisions do effect your outcome and if you make some "bad" decisions the game will play out it a different way. However in Sword of Asumi's case the game never really plays out too differently overall. There is a BIT of replay value but nothing spectacular. Now my BIG problem with Sword of Asumi's gameplay is it is SHORT! This game was originally what, like 15 dollars? The game doesn't really last longer than an hour or two. It's a bit ridiculous honestly. Though I can't really complain about the decisions too much the amount of gameplay you will be getting is kind of pathetic.\n\nStory: Well ok, the story begins as you, Asumi, a member of an order of warriors named the Justicars and you infiltrate an estate to assasinate the owner. You get a quick peak at some decisions as you go through with your mission regardless. Then after that Kami, a fellow Justicar, aproaches you and congratulates you on a mission success while also briefing you on a new one. A rebel group called "Orochi" deadset on overthrowing the government has been tracked by Kami, and the rest of the higher up Justicars for some time, and Kami has now found a new lead on one of their members codenamed "Raven" who is residing at the prestigious school "Battle Academy" so as a test of sorts to see if Asumi will be let into the higher ranks of the justicars, Kami sends Asumi into the school disguised as a first year student to stop Raven by killing them. (Why would you risk a lead this big on someone who isn't even an expert in your order, I know she's young enough for the role but there HAS to be SOMEBODY else!) So you then go to the school, meet the love interests and then set about on your mission. The story isn't horrible it's just very cliche and to be honest with not a lot of surprises. It's pretty bland to me. Along with that it's very rushed in it's delivery before you know it you're at the end of the line, as such you can't be as invested as you should be because suddenly the game is just over. However I'll give it this Asumi is always trying to accomplish her goal it's not like it's a bunch of filler with an occasional spout of progress. Though still, the story is very short, cliche, and rushed in it's delivery it's not very well thought out. The dialogue feels non-emotional and rushed as well it feels like they have a big checklist in front of them all the time checking off everything they need to make a quick buck.\n\nCharacters: THEY ARE ALL BLAND AND CLICHE! Nothing much more to say, other than they all have fanservice dedicated to them in several sections. You have the pretty shopping lightheaded-esque girl who is also bisexual, you have the smart one who likes to read and loves poetry etc. etc. you can tell that none of these characters took any thought into creating. The main villain was incredibly obvious, at least for me, and they're just not that interesting. You can tell the guy who made this literally spent the shortest ammount of time he could on these characters.\n\nRomance: It's very quick and really isn't too believable for me. It just happens a little too fast and well it's just very bland and uncreative the situations you are put in don't really have that much creativity put into them they're just not very well written romances.\n\nSetting: The game takes place in "Battle Academy" a big school, yada yada yada. While I have seen school settings done SOOO many times before this one is still an ok setting I suppose but they don't show you enough of the school for you to truly appreciate that, part of that DEFINITELY has to do with the story's sense of rapid fire pacing.\n\nArt: The art is ok, nothing really ugly about it...... EXCEPT THERE IS A ♥♥♥♥ TON OF FANSERVICE!!! The amount of times Asumi undresses is astonishing to me because it happens so often, not only does it get repetitive and its something they could've replace with scenes to make the story longer, but it's awkward and idiotic to see them pandor like this. On top of that it's not even just Asumi, the girls are drawn like they have a bunch of breast implants and the guys are ♥♥♥♥ing muscular as all hell. This is pandoring at it's near worst. On top of that no one receives character art besides the love interests and villains. The only exceptions to this are Kami and some twins. WHY YOU HAD SO MUCH MONEY WHY DID YOU NOT JUST DRAW MORE CHARACTERS UP!\n\nSummary: Sword of Asumi had a kickstarter that raised them MORE than enough money to make a visual novel with decent length, unique/interesting characters and a lot of good art. They did not use that potential. Instead they made a boring, unsurprising, uncreative, pandoring, rushed, cheap, immination of what visual novels should be. It's sort of a scandal really. The people who made this game, AJTilley has a habbit of this, Beach Bounce was TERRIBLE and their other visual novels have the same syndrome. THEY ARE ALL RUSHED WITH NO CREATIVITY WITH FORCED DIALOGUE AND ROMANCE! DO NOT buy this game save your money. If you REALLY want a visual novel, well to be honest I reccomend Everlasting Summer, it's free and has more substance than this quick waste of your money and time.","August 15, 2015","false","6.6"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","14","21","2","1"

Still, being an assassin is fun, even if there is a lot of socializing and SOL action between the assassin antics. The story itself does not change much no matter who you decide to romance, which diminishes replay value; in fact, the canonical ending has you romance no one. In addition, it's pretty much the set up for the graphic novel with the much more interesting story, which is why I recommended to buy that specifically with this VN.\n\nCharacters:\nThe romancable characters are all surprisingly moe, even the guys (no homo). In particular, Hikari radiates moe from every pore of his body (no homo, totally). In any case, I enjoyed the interactions between Asumi and the romantic interests; seeing how Asumi interacts with them makes the game replayable even if almost all of the overarching plot remains the same no matter what. A shame that none of the romanceable characters appear in the graphic novel story at all.\n\nArt:\nThe sprite art is pretty good, and the CG art isn't necessarily bad, but there is a jarring inconsistency between the CG art and sprite art. Personally, that bothers me more than consistently bad art.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're bored and this is on a sale, this will alleviate your boredom a bit. It's not spectacular, but it's somewhat enjoyable.","March 18, 2015","true","2.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

You are on a mission as an assassin and have multiple options as romance and others are concerned. The game makes you go into a scene of stealth, trickery, and school. You got your new mission and along the way take classes in order to find out more about Orochi.\n\nThis game was good in my opinion. Not Voiced Acted but the music was nice. The story had some nice portrayals of character. The fun minigame and choices of what to take, with there also being the romance options of both girl and boy. You end up taking the routes and you can lose if you didn't choose some in a right order. The Cg is decent and I love how the creator has her changing clothes each day and the usual hitting part.

On the plus side, it does have a catchy opening theme, decent illusion of choice and four romantic options that are not completely parallel to one another(!). It advertises a multitude of endings but a couple of the achievements are quite unlikely unless you go out of your way to be stupid.\n\nCompared to the competition, it has quite a limited CG gallery as most of the eye candy comes from the character sprites, with romance option Kaori being a cosplay otaku and protagonist Asumi in particular being quite the lingerie fiend. However, there isn't much fanservice to be had from the character-featuring CGs found in the gallery.\n\nAt this price, I'd say wait for a sale but don't overlook it if you're into VNs.\n\nIf you do get this game, incidentally, you are offered DLC for the soundtrack, a graphic novel and a "character creator". The Character Creator is a flat out no - not only is it unpolished (underwear appearing over pants) but it lacks the best lingerie offered in the game itself which is, arguably, the entire point. The soundtrack is purchaseable if you want to support them on the basis of the opening theme alone, as none of the other tracks are worth writing home about. The graphic novel is a reasonable production for the price and could be worth considering if you want to see glimpses of Asumi, Lingerie Fiend of Edo's adventures in her world, but their artist for it lacks experience with action scenes, non-chibi expressions and poses, which pretty much tanks the whole book.","April 17, 2015","false","5.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Sorry for the spoiler :-)\n\nIt's a vanilla Visual Novel.   It's not witty.  It's not sarcastic.   It's not dark, nor foreboding.   It's about as plain a story as you can get.  This doesn't make the story bad, just plain, and in being plain it can't rise the game enough to merit a thumbs up.\n\nWhy I gave it a thumbs down - 90% of the choices are immaterial.  You choose who you date and therefore can fall in love with by end of game, and then in last scene, pick who you think is the leader of the rebellion and either use/don't use your date to "win" which leads to the eight or so endings.  That's the game.  Rest is just choices that may (or often won't) result in different text.\n\nTotal game play = 4-5 hours max to get all achievements which I suppose if you're  a person that likes to tally perfect games, then this one could be for you for that reason and only that reason.\n\nThe listed cost is exhorbitant for what is offered here.

The characters are bad versions of stereotypical anime characters including the brooding mysterious loner, the bubbly-always-happy girl, the shy (and secretly naughty) glasses girl and the rich blonde in a position of authority. The writing feels amateurish and is made worse by multiple typos throughout the game. There are moments when you are required to make correct decisions or choose correct answers one after the other, but they have no effect on the story regardless if you get them correct or fail. The multiple endings are just slight variations of each other based on what characters you pick at the end. The art can be described as inconsistent at best and ranges from passable to really bad.

While I enjoyed this game, I would only recommend it to a certain type of person.  I would only recommend this game if you're somewhat desperate for a romantic visual novel.  While it's pretty fun, there are definitely better ones out there.\n\nThe story is pretty nice.  You're an assassin who must infiltrate a school and find the leader of a rebel group before they attack.  While there, you meet several people, a few of which are dateable.  Finding out the identity of the rebel leader is somewhat difficult, and I didn't figure it out until the very end (call me an idiot if you want).  While the different routes provide a bit of variety between plays, it all feels rather same-y.  I wish there were a few more unique scenes with each romantic partner.\n\nUnfortunately the story is the best part about this game.  The actual gameplay pretty much consists of you just picking who you want to date, and making choices that you think they would like.  It's really easy to figure out which choice goes with which person, and only 1 or 2 choices are pure guesswork.  The art style is also nice, but there just should have been more of it.  The backgrounds stay the same for rather long periods of time, and there are only a few different images for each character.  All the action is going to be in the dialogue, so just be prepared for that.\n\nThe game is also really short.  The first playthrough will last 1.5-2 hours, and subsequent playthroughs take a half hour, tops.  Secondary playthrough are where problems with the lack of variety really show.  You end up spending a large portion of your time just skipping the dialogue.\n\nWhile it may seem that I only have bad things to say about this game, I enjoyed it enough to warrant a positive review.  If you can get past the stationary artwork and minimal player input, then you will find a rather nice experience.  Grab this game when it's at least 50% off, as it isn't really worth the full price.","September 22, 2015","true","3.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You give me a case of something caffinated, a sack of munchies and a stack of VNs and I'm good for at least a night, maybe even the next day if there's enough in the way of soda and munchies. About the only things that really get my goat about a VN is wasted potential and bad writing- and well... you add those two things in and throw in a terrible story about an alternate-reality Japan that never opened its borders, well... you get "The Sword of Asumi".\n\nYou get to play Asumi, an assassin from the Black Clan, which is famous for taking in orphans, brainwashing them, and then turning them out to kill whoever they get paid enough to kill. Of course, Asumi is still just barely out of high school, and is already an accomplished assassin- in fact, well, the opening mission establishes that fact quite well. So what does her next mission entail? Going undercover at what is said to be a "battle school" of some sort that the children of samurai go to so they can learn everything they need to know. It's basically all a pretense so she can start running around in a school uniform.... and then they shoehorn in a plot about a rebel group going undercover at the school to stage a bombing along with a bit of a romance subplot that really sticks out like a hammer-smashed thumb.\n\nI also ought to mention that the game isn't exactly 100% there- the original is available from the developer's website and has the adult content that this version's had to have removed so it could be listed on Steam. I'm not linking the website because of NSFW-ness, but if you want, you can find a link on the game's Steam store page and go find them that way. But there's still the copious scenes of Asumi cavorting around in her room in various forms of undress and fancy underwear, so if you're into cheesecake like that, there's that at least.\n\nThe story isn't the strong point- it reads more like a fanfiction that somebody wrote, and there's not really much coherence to it besides Asumi being out of her element when she takes classes that don't cater to her strengths and the like. The main plot of the game gets shunted off so you can go play schoolgirl and try to figure out just what path you have to take. The other part I really dislike is the biggest pet peeve of mine- the fact that nobody seems to have run the text through any kind of spellcheck or editor to make sure it reads and looks all right. I mean, really? In this day and age, when you have programs like Office, Word, and OpenOffice out there, this kind of laziness is the absolute worst thing, especially in a game that pretty much requires the text be clear in order to help people understand just what's going on.\n\nThere is a save function, which is something, but once you make enough runs through the game to get all the endings and the like and unlock all the CG scenes, well... there's not that much left to do with it. The story's not memorable, the characters are forgettable, and the ending requires basically the same set of choices every time around. Once you're done with it, well, there's not much reason to pick it back up.\n\nNormally, this is nine Gabendollars, and if you pay that much for it, I have a bridge in New York to sell you. If it catches a nice hefty sale, it might be worth picking up if you really like VNs or just want to giftbomb someone who does with it. I think it's all right at about $2.50 or so, but paying more than that isn't really advised unless you really have a serious VN addiction. Maybe if the text was cleaned up it might be worth another look, but once you get all the stuff unlocked and run out of card drops, well... what cause do you have to pick it up more than once in a blue moon after that?\n\nTL;DR - Just a few bits of cheesecake wrapped up in a story that needs a lot of work. 4/10.","April 2","false","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So many do it so right.\nThe music is great, more than one tune is memorable and more importantly they set the atmosphere! When a scene is tense, it feels tense because the music portrays that. The soud effects (or lack thereof) are fine but if you've played a visual novel you know that it is more like "sound effect" because their is usually only one. The sound of you clicking to start the game or save/load. But enough foreplay lets get onto the meat.\n\nYou play the role of an assassin who needs to find the leader of a terrorist group hiding out in a school. Of course the leader is not going to openly come out and state who they are so you have to socialize and play the part of an ordinary student while trying to unmask and kill the real leader.\n\nI hate to say it but the game employs the 'old is evil' trope. You are the equivilent of a freshman and everyone older than you is a badguy. Futhermore the game gives heapings of fanservice. We play as a girl you see and lesbian romance is normal and accepted in an all girl schoo-- This isn't an all girls school? Oh. Don't misunderstand I am not homophobic; I wish gay and lesbian storylines were written more convincingly. A girl falls in love with me because wait, did I say 'a' girl? As in singular?

Okay games like this when you play as the guy are no better (although they oddly miss the guyxguy dating aspect...Hmmm) but I never felt any of the girlxgirl romances were convincing where as actual time and effort went into if you wanted to date the guys in this game.\n\nA minor gripe for me because the romance just drives the plot forward inbetween taking people down or choosing where to go next to be most likely to find clues but all of this is ruined by the dial an ending.\nThis game is no masterpiece like 'Long Live The Queen', most of your actions are meaningless because once you know whom are responsible (did I spoil it with the 'everybody older than you is evil' trope?) then you can pretty much choose your ending with ease.\n\nReally with a visual novel not a lot matters except the quality of the writing and the fun you had with the game and I'm happy to say the writing is well done, a bit off in places but mostly fine. I had a lot of fun with the game, playing as an assassin in a school romp visual novel seemed like a poor fit but there are just enough action parts for you to remember what it is you should be doing and the game is purposefully short, probabaly so you can unlock the many, many, oh so many different endings. Or at least if it wasn't for save/load which unlocked like 12 achievements for me as I just choose who to confess my love too before making my way to kill the big bad.\n\nI recommend this game. It's shortcoming are no deal breakers by any means and if you like girls in skimpy lingerie kissing other girls then this game has that but you also have internet access so I don't see way you wou-- There is a group dedicated to Waifu material games?

I quite enjoyed having a female protagonist, and there was a fair bit of art variety in this, too. The music was pretty good, especially the main menu music, which was very haunting. I liked most of the characters in this, too, and even if first impressions of some weren't the best, like Utsuru, they had some surprises for you, and end up being quite likable. The game gives you a lot of choices as well, so if you're looking for a VN that gives you a lot of options, meaningful or otherwise, Sword of Asumi has you covered.\n\nIt's not all good, I hate to say. The game is still riddled with typos despite being released - most of them are clustered together in scenes so it looks like segments were missed during editing. However, the dev is actively patching the game to correct this, even as I write, so it may not be the case later. The game is also very short - you can finish it in a couple of hours and the ending doesn't exactly feel satisfying. It feels rushed and ends rather abruptly once you complete your mission. It doesn't feel like there's much in the way of replay value, either, unfortunately, despite several people you can fall in love with. Ultimately who you fall in love with has little influence on the ending. A forever alone good end is possible, too - and has some great art - which is nice, although it isn't explicit and can make a dead end more likely for reasons I'm unsure of.\n\nIt sounds like I'm being overly negative, but I did enjoy this game. I'm just disappointed that there isn't more - a few extra hours for more investigation would help add to this, and maybe a little more school related stuff, as well as an expanded upon ending and conclusion outside of a few lines summarising what you'd be able to infer. Also, an editor to go over it and fix up the grammar would help with my enjoyment. These are mistakes that a basic spell check would pick up, amongst others, and a VN should be held to high standards given the amount of reading you do. I look forward to seeing how future games will improve, and I wouldn't mind a return to this universe, or perhaps an expansion.","January 9, 2015","true","5.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

It was rather short, and I'm hoping for another SOA, but let me just tell you something: this review is not opinionized, I will keep my opinions (other than a few "I liked this feature") notes) to a mininal.\n\nSTORY:\nThis story follows Asumi, and the orders she recieves in order to become a real assassin (Justicar). Asumi, not knowing what awaits her, accepts the quest; this isn't going to be another easy task, though, it's different. Infiltrate the school and find terrorists, kill if necessary, or take hostages. There are many things, many paths, you must do in order to achieve success, or death (very interesting). The story CAN be obvious to people like me who read books constantly, or if you can easily just detect it.\n\nIt has multiple endings, but that does NOT mean it has replay value!\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nYou're given choices, same as any other VN, and these choices effect Asumi (obviously). The endings don't feel pushed on you, it's completely up to you, the controller. Making sure the choice you pick is right is pretty much essential in this game, and can be the decision between life and death (seriously, my first playthrough taught me that). It has multiple endings, lots of achievements, and many lovers. I really did wish this game were longer, giving more choices and time to do stuff. Other than being kind of rushed, it's a polished game.\n\nART:\nThe art is nice (kind of sad the DLC doesn't allow for character importing/saving, but...), and the art IS consistant throughout the game. It's not complex, and it's not simple, the game tries to constantly change expressions in any possibly way(s).\n\n7/10\nVery fun game, but it doesn't last long, by any means whatsoever (don't mind my game-time; I've left it on for an hour or so, and I've tried multiple endings... still waiting for some achievements). There's no replay value to this game, but the time you spend playing it and deciding is quite pleasant, the music is nice, and the art-style is eye candy.","November 13, 2015","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I mean the background of the CGs could had been different or the position of them kissing or somthing else. I am focus on that because in this kind of game (otome game) people expect the best CGs on romance part which even makes the player blush, I guess I overestimated this game. And there was in one CG, which didn't have to be a CG, it could have been a normal background and the character, so I thought it was not an appropriate to put the CG or maybe just a glimps of it then just change.\n\nMaybe they work too much on the music.

Also, your love choice makes no difference really, since each ending is literally a "guess whodunnit" choice I'm assuming only a few actions in the entire game have any lasting effect whatsoever. A wonderful example of this is the entire "kill or disarm" mechanic. You'd assume killing people in a school has consequences, but it really doesn't. No one so much as questioned as to why a good 8 or so people on campus were killed when I was nowhere to be found. Remember how people complained that in Mass Effect 3 your choices got narrowed down into a few set paths, ignoring everything you did in the game? I kind of get that vibe from this.\n\nTerrible game:\nDo not play VNs like this.

The game itself can be finished in a short evening.\n\nThe visual novel aspect is decently done since there are actual choices with reasonable impact the player can make, like whether to simply kill or disable the few targets the game has. The characters are also interesting.\n\nThe main art for the characters is decently done. The cinematic imagery is noticeably worse- probably by a different artist who isn't bad, but isn't using the same style as the game's basic sprites. Going from the in-game sprites to the cinematic images is very jarring because of the change in styles.\n\nThe story is understandable and enjoyable, but it is also filled with grammatical errors, punctuation errors, spelling errors, and all sorts of issues that make it seem as though there was no editor for the material.\n\nUltimately, I would recommend playing through this if you can get it for cheap during a Steam Sale or through an indie bundle.

As a VN experiment it works ok, but the story needed a lot more deepth and more dialogue.\n\nBut there is a lot of defects in the game that make it unrecommended. First of all, the dialogue is a bit ackward (not unusual in anime and visual novels). The music... at the start I though it was going to be terrible but... truth is that as the game moved on I noticed that is not that all the music is bad (though, they should have invested more in the music) is more a problem that the music was not adequate for many of the scenes, it was sometimes very intense for a placid moment and too jolly for when the conversations in the game turned more serious.\n\nThe worst defect of the game are the clues and the quizzes, I dislike visual novels that require you to play certain options precisely as they want you to to discover clues (for example, going to a random location instead of the other 2 similar options), or that the creators asume you know certain trivia (for example, japanese history or militar strategy) to respond correctly in the game beforehand, instead of including information or clues in the game and dialog so if you payed attention, you put the details you noticed to use.\n\nI really cannot recommend it.","February 28","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The characters are likable enough, if mostly rather generic, and it's a fun enough story. However, I'd recommend waiting until it's on sale; the terrible number of writing errors alone make me feel it's not worth $12 until they release an update that's been properly edited.\n\nLike another reviewer said, those errors become more numerous as the game progresses; early on there are only a couple spots where it looks like spellcheck has swapped in the wrong word or a name's left uncapitalized (for some reason that seems to happen most often with Hikari) but they crop up more and more often until even the title of the romance endings has "Justicar" misspelled in them.\n\nThe next issue is that the game description felt misleading to me. Going in I thought there'd be much more focus on politics and infiltration, but what you get most of the way through is a pretty generic (aside from the type of classes) school life visual novel, just one where the lead occasionally thinks "Could they be Raven?" or "I must find out about Raven!" and then proceeds to not do a single thing to investigate for 90% of the game. And when she does investigate? Most of the time Asumi is TERRIBLE at her job to the point that she does not deserve the job she's in the running for and it's unbelievable they're even offering it. Multiple times on this infiltration mission where she's supposed to suss out the rebel leader without letting anyone know what she's up to she just goes up to people and says "Hey, do you know anything about Raven?" Or the time when, even though it's established later that she has a supply of near-instant tranquilizer darts, she seduces her principle while wearing frilly lingerie to get close enough to take him down instead of just darting him.\n\nAnd speaking of the lingerie, I find it pretty ridiculous that a game that lists a strong female protagonist as its number one feature to entice buyers (and if it did not do that I honestly wouldn't care, it's some cute fanservice) not only has her strip down to the type of lingerie that women just wear in bed for their lovers, not as as day-to-day underwear, every time she changes clothes, they have a wide range of different frilly underthings for players to fap to. Though, weirdly, this is at its dumbest when her undies are at their most modest; more than once she changes into her gym clothes and says she's glad she wore a bra with proper support, and while she's wearing something more normal it's not that. Seriously, the artist needs to learn what a sports bra looks like.\n\nBack to the "strong, deadly, female protagonist" thing, I will not argue about Asumi's deadliness or femaleness, but she is NOT a strong character. She's your cliche not-good-with-people, foot-in-mouth-prone, flustered animeish girl, just one who occasionally goes out and knives dudes. If you want a visual novel with a strong female lead go buy Hatoful Boyfriend, Hiyoko has more personality in her pinky-finger that Asumi has all game long. Mind you, I didn't find Asumi unlikable or anything of the sort, she's just kinda bland but I wouldn't have said anything at all about her personality if it weren't for the way the game is selling itself, but when you wave around the strength of your lead I expect them to have a personality that stands out from the pack and more drive to get out there and do things on their own (Asumi is very passive through most of the game, not leaving her room to do things unless she's asked or told to until she finally really starts investigating near the end.)\n\nFinally, with the time frame we're given for the game to romances are pretty dumb. No, you've known each other two weeks, you've hardly even spent time together even if you game it so Asumi spends as much time with her chosen LI as possible, you're not in love. In most cases in the game I can just chalk this one up to stupid teenage infatuation, but in Hikari's case it is absolutely unbelievable with everything we learn about him that he would turn his whole personality around choose her after such a short period. Usually in visual novels we know more time's passing than we see to help explain away relationships that seem to move too fast, but in this case we're explicitly told how little time is going by.\n\nOh, and nitpicky, but I wish you could successfully disable instead of kill at least one of the two targets at the end. The Codex says that Orochi is a group comprised of several different sects and that Raven is only the head of one of them (which kinda wrecks the ending if you've read it, incidentally), so you'd think the right answer for someone who's attempting to become a Justicar who's more than just a killer is to non-lethally take one down so the Justicars can question them about Orochi's other heads. But, again, that's nitpicky, I can understand wanting to tie things up more neatly.\n\nThe description for the game painted an intriguing world that the game itself doesn't live up to. Get it if you want a fun school time visual novel with occasional dips into an infiltration plot that only really takes the spotlight at the very end. Don't get it if what you want is a deep look into the world that description seems to promise. If a sequel is made I deeply hope that it actually puts that worldbuilding to use.","May 23, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The characters are likable enough, if mostly rather generic, and it's a fun enough story. However, I'd recommend waiting until it's on sale; the terrible number of writing errors alone make me feel it's not worth $12 until they release an update that's been properly edited.\n\nLike another reviewer said, those errors become more numerous as the game progresses; early on there are only a couple spots where it looks like spellcheck has swapped in the wrong word or a name's left uncapitalized (for some reason that seems to happen most often with Hikari) but they crop up more and more often until even the title of the romance endings has "Justicar" misspelled in them.\n\nThe next issue is that the game description felt misleading to me. Going in I thought there'd be much more focus on politics and infiltration, but what you get most of the way through is a pretty generic (aside from the type of classes) school life visual novel, just one where the lead occasionally thinks "Could they be Raven?" or "I must find out about Raven!" and then proceeds to not do a single thing to investigate for 90% of the game. And when she does investigate? Most of the time Asumi is TERRIBLE at her job to the point that she does not deserve the job she's in the running for and it's unbelievable they're even offering it. Multiple times on this infiltration mission where she's supposed to suss out the rebel leader without letting anyone know what she's up to she just goes up to people and says "Hey, do you know anything about Raven?" Or the time when, even though it's established later that she has a supply of near-instant tranquilizer darts, she seduces her principle while wearing frilly lingerie to get close enough to take him down instead of just darting him.\n\nAnd speaking of the lingerie, I find it pretty ridiculous that a game that lists a strong female protagonist as its number one feature to entice buyers (and if it did not do that I honestly wouldn't care, it's some cute fanservice) not only has her strip down to the type of lingerie that women just wear in bed for their lovers, not as as day-to-day underwear, every time she changes clothes, they have a wide range of different frilly underthings for players to fap to. Though, weirdly, this is at its dumbest when her undies are at their most modest; more than once she changes into her gym clothes and says she's glad she wore a bra with proper support, and while she's wearing something more normal it's not that. Seriously, the artist needs to learn what a sports bra looks like.\n\nBack to the "strong, deadly, female protagonist" thing, I will not argue about Asumi's deadliness or femaleness, but she is NOT a strong character. She's your cliche not-good-with-people, foot-in-mouth-prone, flustered animeish girl, just one who occasionally goes out and knives dudes. If you want a visual novel with a strong female lead go buy Hatoful Boyfriend, Hiyoko has more personality in her pinky-finger that Asumi has all game long. Mind you, I didn't find Asumi unlikable or anything of the sort, she's just kinda bland but I wouldn't have said anything at all about her personality if it weren't for the way the game is selling itself, but when you wave around the strength of your lead I expect them to have a personality that stands out from the pack and more drive to get out there and do things on their own (Asumi is very passive through most of the game, not leaving her room to do things unless she's asked or told to until she finally really starts investigating near the end.)\n\nFinally, with the time frame we're given for the game to romances are pretty dumb. No, you've known each other two weeks, you've hardly even spent time together even if you game it so Asumi spends as much time with her chosen LI as possible, you're not in love. In most cases in the game I can just chalk this one up to stupid teenage infatuation, but in Hikari's case it is absolutely unbelievable with everything we learn about him that he would turn his whole personality around choose her after such a short period. Usually in visual novels we know more time's passing than we see to help explain away relationships that seem to move too fast, but in this case we're explicitly told how little time is going by.\n\nOh, and nitpicky, but I wish you could successfully disable instead of kill at least one of the two targets at the end. The Codex says that Orochi is a group comprised of several different sects and that Raven is only the head of one of them (which kinda wrecks the ending if you've read it, incidentally), so you'd think the right answer for someone who's attempting to become a Justicar who's more than just a killer is to non-lethally take one down so the Justicars can question them about Orochi's other heads. But, again, that's nitpicky, I can understand wanting to tie things up more neatly.\n\nThe description for the game painted an intriguing world that the game itself doesn't live up to. Get it if you want a fun school time visual novel with occasional dips into an infiltration plot that only really takes the spotlight at the very end. Don't get it if what you want is a deep look into the world that description seems to promise. If a sequel is made I deeply hope that it actually puts that worldbuilding to use.","May 23, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a VN experiment it works ok, but the story needed a lot more deepth and more dialogue.\n\nBut there is a lot of defects in the game that make it unrecommended. First of all, the dialogue is a bit ackward (not unusual in anime and visual novels). The music... at the start I though it was going to be terrible but... truth is that as the game moved on I noticed that is not that all the music is bad (though, they should have invested more in the music) is more a problem that the music was not adequate for many of the scenes, it was sometimes very intense for a placid moment and too jolly for when the conversations in the game turned more serious.\n\nThe worst defect of the game are the clues and the quizzes, I dislike visual novels that require you to play certain options precisely as they want you to to discover clues (for example, going to a random location instead of the other 2 similar options), or that the creators asume you know certain trivia (for example, japanese history or militar strategy) to respond correctly in the game beforehand, instead of including information or clues in the game and dialog so if you payed attention, you put the details you noticed to use.\n\nI really cannot recommend it.","February 28","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Asumi is sent to Battle Academy in a mission to find a dangerous terrorist named Raven while disguised as a normal student.\n\nThe game has everything to be a great game. But sadly, the second Asumi steps onto campus, the terrorism plotline is shoved into the background and instead you'll start playing a date sim game where most of your choices won't matter until near the end of the game.\n\nMost of the characters also lack a good background story, being like empty shells. That being said, even though the game is kind of mediocre, you can still have a bit of fun with it. There're a plenty of endings, options (although most of them won't influence the ending you'll get) and romanceable characters. It can be a fun game if you aren't very picky with Visual Novels. If you're, don't even try: you'll probably think this one is a total failure.","April 20","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, there was not enough development of the characters and the endings seem extremely rushed. The writing is also pretty amateur. For instance, there are lines where the character states she is changing - that is a line that adds no value, in a typical VN you would jump to the next location with a different outfit. It's like a movie, not everything needs to be stated up front. I also disliked the quiz mini-games as I thought they were too random, too frequent, and did not really add anything to the story.\n\nAs a small silver lining, this game does not enforce very strict criteria for the endings so a guide may not be necessary for many of the outcomes.","May 20","false","6.6"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
