The book contains extra info on how the game was built up, how the developers started with many ideas, a horroristic game with monsters, and how they ended up with a survival story. It was a long road and you can find many interesting concept arts about this in the book. If you're really into the game, you'll surely enjoy seeing all the awesome behind the scenes stuff.","February 18, 2014","true","7.0"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","38","44","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jipearce82/recommended/233410/","jipearce82","Senno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jipearce82/","755 products in account","Fans and gamers were spoilt with Tomb Raider - the rebooted origin tale of the titular Lara Croft - and this wonderful behind-the-scenes digital book companion will offer great insight into how it all happened. Veteran journalist Geoff Keighley provides a relatively comprehensive look at the design process, showcasing many concepts that never made it to the finished game, as well as artwork, sketches, interviews and reports on how Crystal Dynamics recreated the video game icon.\n\nThis well designed application is best used on a tablet computer, but can be enjoyed just as easily on a desktop. Additionally, there are interactive elements, such as panoramas of the developer's studio and a music mixer. Much of the video content is actually streamed rather than downloaded with the application, but I found the content both new and good quality.\n\nWhile everything is well designed and easy to navigate, I found the content lacking. The whole book can be read in just over an hour, and there is little beyond the abandoned concepts that proves truly captivating. For those who have followed previews, the content could be considered lightweight. And for those who haven't, there isn't a great deal on offer to make this a must-buy.\n\nFor Lara Croft fans, this is a fine addition to a wonderful game, and for those interested in the development process, Tomb Raider - The Final Hours offers a glimpse behind the curtain into the industry and the pressure to reboot gaming royalty. Overall, however, this is just an optional add on that offers little value for money and should only be purchased as part of a collector's edition. There just isn't enough content to justify its asking price.\n\nFor the fans.\n\n6.5/10.","February 15, 2014","true","2.0"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","2"

Instead it has its' own entry in the Steam Library and starts up with an executable file. It DOES NOT ADD TO GAME. What it does is that it shows us a documentary of how Tomb Raider was made. With that comes concept art, unused/cut content, the backstory of the franchize and the devs. There are also videos which open up and most of them are a narrative series lead by Zach Levi as he shows us the people involved in TR. Unfortunately most of THESE ARE YOUTUBE VIDEOS (7 in total). Meaning that you will not be able to view them if a video is taken down/broken/restricted in a country. I already had 1 link to a private video there. So it boils down on how much you like Crystal Dynamics and documentaries. If not much, you can pass and won't miss this.

To put it simply, there isn't. But what's there is really good. If you're a fan of the tomb raider series (and thats every game mind you) then you will enjoy the content in this. There are lots of cool exclusive, behind-the-scenes videos to be seen here. There is also a final hours series of videos that include interviews with people at crystal dynamics etc. However, be warned that whilst the final hours videos aren't included on the PC version of Tomb Raider 2013, they are included on the PS3 and XBOX 360 versions of the game. Not sure about the definitive edition.\nBack to the book however, the information is well written and interesting to read. There are also lots of interactive sequences, such as one where you can compare the in-game Lara's face and the model's face that she was based on.\n\nPositive\n+ Interactive Sections\n+ Easy to Read\n+ Behind the Scenes Videos\n\nNegative\n- Not much content\n\nConclusionA good and interesting look at how Crystal Dynamics reinvented the Tomb Raider franchise, reccommended for fans of the franchise but be warned that there isn't a huge amount of content on offer.\n","February 17, 2015","true","2.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I really enjoyed the implementation of the videos and the behind the scenes look at thier studios. I really believe they are taking the franchise in the right direction. There are many reasons why Tomb Raider has become my single favorite video game and in part because of the wonderful community that surrounds it.
