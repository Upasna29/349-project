"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/recommended/342580/","chudah","Chudah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/","1693 products in account","12 Labours of Hercules is the best Time Management game I've ever played.  The extremely tight tuning, flexibility of play and excellent presentation makes the game incredibly fun and rewarding, especially for those who aim for perfection.\n\nAs with other titles in the genre, you're tasked with completing a set of goals in order to proceed to the next level.  While the goals vary, the general concept is the same; collect resources and construct buildings to beat the timer.  Efficiently managing your workers is at the heart of the gameplay, although it's by no means necessary if you want to play more casually, but doing so adds strategic depth to what is in essence a very simple game.  Ultimately, the more effort you put into challenging yourself, the more reward you'll get out of it.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=458157857\nThere are multiple ways to complete each level, but to earn gold, especially on Expert, not only are your multi-tasking skills put to the test but strategic planning as well.  Figuring out which routes need to be cleared first, the order buildings are to be constructed (and whether to level them fully or at all), and which of the multiple power-ups are most beneficial to reaching your goal is what makes the game so  fulfilling.  You can tear your hair out spending dozens of tries on a single level, but when you make that one small change that brings your +5 second run to a -5, the feeling of accomplishment is like nothing else.\n\nA handful of mini-boss levels breaks up the standard gameplay with Hercules fighting off mythical beasts and smashing through barriers on his quest to save Megara.  These are enjoyable little interludes that add variety and humor to an already fun game.\n\nPresentation is great as well.  I generally don't expect much graphically from these games, but the artwork is cute and the animations fun.  Musically, the soundtrack is a joy featuring plenty of classically inspired themes that are quite impressive for a casual title.  Topping it off is full Steam integration with achievements, cards, cloud saves, and even leader boards, something ALL casual games benefit from on the platform.\n\nIt's not often that I walk away from a game with not a single complaint, but 12 Labours of Hercules has managed that feat.  My only worry is that I will now hold all future Time Management games to the excellent standard of this gem, and that's a high precedent to reach. But excellence always comes at a price. Unless you absolutely abhor the genre, there's no excuse not owning this gem, especially considering the very generous sales it often receives.\n\nBottom Line: A must have gem that belongs in every gamer's library.","June 9, 2015","true","29.4"," 111 of 119 people (93%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","93","111","119","7","9"

The mere fact that only half a year later the fourth game in the series has already been greenlit, speaks tons about the game's success.\n\n12 Labours of Hercules is being advertised as a casual strategy game, but in reality it's a time-management game with very limited strategical options or choices. The story, although rooted in Greek mythology, is shallow and serves merely as a framework for the 40-odd levels. These levels are almost all based upon the same principle: control your workers (and now and then a very lazy Hercules or some other mythological figure) in order to clear the path towards the objective. In order to do so, you'll need three resources: food, materials & gold. These can be found or collected in several different ways, such as constructing and upgrading appropriate buildings.\n\nSince each level is timed, it's quite important to take a look at the map before rushing off, noticing the places where buildings can be put or gold can be found. Playing on "casual" difficulty let me progress through the game without much of a hassle, collecting "gold score" on almost every level at the first try (and I am a complete noob at this type of game). But the higher difficulty setting was an entirely different story: all of sudden every second counted, and one wrong action early on in a level could ruin it. An extra difficulty level in between these two extremes would have been nice, but that's a very minor criticism.\n\nDuring the course of a level, the player can activate one or more "powers" which boost some aspect of the gathering & building process. This provides a neat extra layer of gameplay, something the game needed more and more while progressing since the levels are nearly all built upon the same principle. Happily, the levels are never too long: most of them last somewhere between 5 and 10 minutes, which makes the game perfectly suited to be consumed as a gaming snack.\n\n12 Labours of Hercules comes with full Steam integration such as trading cards, leaderboards and a varied bunch of achievements. These are not very difficult but still entertaining, and the game can be completed to 100% really easily or without any tiresome grinding.\n\nHighly recommended to everyone with an even remote interest in time-management games. Or to all of you looking for a quick but very tasteful snack.","September 18, 2015","true","13.0"," 72 of 79 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","72","79","0","6"

This first one in the series is fun, relaxing and a point on choice for a couple of easy achievements as the rest of the series. If you feel like sparing time for a series of automated actions to meet certain challenges and have a smile now and then, keep reading.\n\nFirst and foremost, these games are vaguely based on the actual 12 Labours of Hercules, an epic poem written by Peisander in 600 BC, narrating the 12 years that legendary Greek hero spent in service to King Eurystheus to atone for killing his own family whence he was maddened by Hera. As you can see, these kiddy versions of the legend are not as gruesome as the actual tale. For the content of the game, there is little to no story. All we know is that Hades abducted Megara - Hercules' wife - for unknown reasons and we are to take her back by building a path between Hellas and the Underworld with the aid of our servants and some monster buddies of ours. The game - as the rest of its instalments - mostly consists of thrown around mythological figures and a most required happy ending.\n\nAs for the display, art is cartoonish and enjoyable; not the worst that I've encountered in these kind of casual games. Icons and animations are cute. Everything’s pretty much Disney-ish actually. Music is cute, but with this amount of repetition in each and every level you may prefer muting it down after some time.\n\nAs for the gameplay, you basically drive some servants to collect resources, build paths and activate certain encounters within a limited time while you and your monster 'buddies' overcome some challenges. Game mechanics are real simple and easy to master, and your abilities to buff certain conditions makes this a casual game with little strategic planning. The most you'd find to be challenging is the achievement to complete all levels on Gold Time. It is possible to finish all quests within 3-4 hours anyhow.\n\nIf you feel like taking a break from some serious business that you've been attending, this is the perfect game with little to no brain involvement. You mostly play it with your reaction rate. All these games do go for a decent sale most of the time, so you may prefer getting it in one of those times.

But it's quite a decent port, I have to say. Fullscreen and widescreen support, works well with the mouse, there's no limitation that comes from it's port form.\nThe game itself is a fast paced time management game, with very little puzzle elements - by puzzle I mean that on some levels you need to carefully plan your actions, because you'll run low on certain resources, and you won't be able to finish the game on time. Speaking about "on time": there's a casual difficulty - it's quite easy to get gold time each of the levels, and even if you run out of time, the level doesn't end, you can finish it, so while the timer is there as a goal, there's no punishment if you happen to be slower\nIf you happen to love similar games, I absolutely recommend this game to you. It's fun, nice colourful, child-friendly (When the Medusa kills the minotaur, it simply fades away) and overall nice game - usually with deep discount every now and then.\nAlso, while I'm not exactly sure about that, but I think the commentary between chapters is done in in  traditional, ancient Greek form of verse [en.wikipedia.org]","July 7, 2015","true","10.7"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","2"

This is a casual clicking game.\n\nThe Pros:Cute, Simple Fun - The game's concept is simple, but enjoyable. Clicking the screen and queuing up your actions would be boring, but it's fast paced, and while time doesn't press you, you will want to be as fast as possible. The levels themselves are repetitive to a degree, but if played in short bursts, it is actually a fun time killer.\n\nDecent # of gameplay elements - You have to divide your attention between getting resources, clearing paths, upgrading your buildings, and meeting special requirements to clear obstacles. Different levels contain a different mix of such elements.\n\nGame Length - Each level will take you between 6 and 10 minutes to complete, and there are 40 levels in total. All in all it took me 5 and a bit hours to casually stroll through the game while also getting all the achievements.\n\nAchievement Hunter Material - 22 very easy achievements that (most of them) come naturally during gameplay.\nThe Cons:Very Easy - While playing on normal, you have to be brain dead to not finish the game in gold time. Expert mode is a bit harder, but still lacks the "ultimate challenge" flare. If you are looking for a casual game, you've come to the right place.\n\nMisleading Title - The game should be called "1 to 4 Laborers of Hercules", since all he does is swing in his hammock and only every so often gets out to kick a boulder or win the level. Slacker...\nConclusion:Get this game while on sale. It often runs for as low as 0.14€, that's a steal, and it even has Steam Trading Cards. That's a tough deal to match.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

It has cute and colorful 2.5D graphics and a lovely entertaining soundtrack (one song really sounds like Greek). Placed in the ancient Greek mythology you accomplish many tasks in 40 challenging levels and fight four different bosses. You will also buildup four ancient marvels during the level proccess.\n\nSo what is this time-management about?\nBasically you start with a static map with blocked pathways and tasks. You give orders to running servants which do several jobs like repair/unblock roads, collect the 3 types of resources (food, wood, gold) and unlock bridges or caves. For each servant one job + 3 additional jobs (shown as flags) you declare their priority list in which order they should complete them. That can become critical in higher levels because everything happens under the pressure of time shown as a shrinking bar on the left side. Lateron you will get the ability to use powerups from another slowly raising bar on the right side. You also have mythology heros like Hercules, Medusa or Pegasus that can remove bolders or fight minotaurs, harpies anfd ghosts for spending food or gold. In the end the choice of the right pathway decides if you win a map with 3 stars or loose. I wouldn't say it's real strategy - just find the hidden pattern once.\n\nFinally I would consider the game is ideal for kids. It's not only completely violentless but challenging and funny. AFAIK it's already published on PurpleHills which means it's somekind of quality assured. Ok the greek mythology is such worthy as "Pirates of the Caribbean" would be a scientific docu about pirates.","October 18, 2015","true","6.4"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","18","22","0","0"

This game is a casual resource management strategy game.  You start each level with one or two workers who travel on set pathways and gather resources.  But they also use resources to clear debris and to build bulidings like a farm.  In later levels you have to carefully choose from multiple pathways to start out otherwise you run out of resources.  When there's a heavy boulder in your way you can call upon Hercules to get his lazy ♥♥♥ out of his hammock and heft the boulder out of the pathway.  Some levels have other characters that help you out like Medusa (yes, she's an ally in this game, not an enemy!), Cerberus, Cyclops, and Pegasus.\n\nThe levels are timed but it only matters if you want to get all the achievements and get the gold rating on all levels.  I found them very easy to complete in plenty of time for the gold rating.  I only had to go back to redo a few levels to get gold.\n\nThere are some "boss" levels which consist of Hercules alternating shooting arrows at enemies and using his strength to move boulders out of the way or break chains.  There is one really cool boss level where instead of fighting you have to gather specific ingredients to make a healing potion.  There are fruits and colorful potions scattered about and it tells you which specific one you need each time.\n\nThe levels do not take much time to complete, a few minutes, so it scratches that itch for quick build management strategy when I don't want to take the time to play a long involved game.\n\nCan't wait for the sequel!","April 13, 2015","true","27.5"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Basically, the story is about how Hercules must travel to various lands and have his servants complete tasks so that he can rescue his wife Megara from Hades.  There are a total of 50 levels and most of these levels consist of collecting resources and such.  However, at every 10th level, there is a minigame in lieu of the usual level.  The minigame requires that you follow the instructions to pass it, like fighting off monsters while not losing your health.\n\nAs a fan of time management games, this is my first game in the 12 Labours of Hercules series that I played.  I enjoyed this game immensely and found it lots of fun.  I liked the gameplay and the minigames were a nice break from the usual level.  Also, there is both a relaxed and expert mode so you can choose what mode to play the game.  Although both modes do have timed levels, the relaxed mode gives more time to complete levels and still make expert score (meaning that you can earn a maximum of three stars for each level).  In addition, this game has Steam achievements and that makes me very happy.  I like the challenge of earning all of the achievements and found it fun without it being frustrating.\n\nOverall, I'd say that if you like time management games, then 12 Labours of Hercules is a good game to pick up.

Except when there's a star-powered Hero Task to do, Hercules spends levels resting happily in his hammock.\n\nIn each of this game's 40 levels you basically need to get across the map. That may involve clearing obstacles in the road; building bridges over rivers or ravines, or boats to sail away on; collecting gold for the trip; or disposing of monsters in your way. You'll gather riches (food, lumber, gold) to pay for everything you do, and generally there's just enough potential wealth in each map to make it to the end in time. Level design is attentive without being mean, and each level will run to solution in five to ten minutes, making this a perfect bite-sized casual game for I-have-a-few-minutes timing needs.\n\nOne clever and irritating design choice adds weight to game achievements by way of in-game monuments. Completing each level in Gold time (there are 10 levels per stage, four stages in all) builds a section of four acient artifacts that have nothing to do with anything, but sit there accusingly when they are only partially completed. In one stage, for example, you're building the Argo, and how can you not finish the Argo? It appeals to fundamental tinkering instincts, and makes the game hard (for me, at least) to complete casually. Because, you know, we've got to finish the Argo before we move on. Right?\n\nWhether you breeze through 12 Labours, or dump hours and hours of just-one-more-try time into the durn thing - I'm at over 60 hours on Steam at this point - depends on two things: whether you are the sort of person who can peacefully leave your ancient wonders half-built, and whether you choose to play on Expert in the initial settings. Think carefully about this. The game is great pleasant fun, and making some of your Gold times on the Expert setting is HARD. With its little dollops of timed frustration, The 12 Labours of Hercules managed to fill up my scattered free time much more than I ever intended. You've been warned.\n\nOnce you finish this game, of course, parts II, III, and IV await.

There are other installments from this series: The Cretan Bull, Girl Power and Mother Nature. 'Girl Power' is already out on other casual gaming sites and 'Mother Nature' is currently being worked on.\n\nNote: There is a storyline for the game but it isn't much to it nor its' rememberable.\n\nThis is a time management game, where careful planning is required, limited amount of resources that are available throughout the game; henced the word management.\n\nThis game has the total of four episodes with ten levels each; totaling out to 40 levels altogether. There twenty-two different achievements but each of them come with a requirement.\n\nThere are two modes, relaxed and expert, two difference between them is the timer speed and scoring. In relaxed mode, the timer drains at a slower rate and the scoring is low. In expert mode, the timer drain quicker and the scoring is much higher.\n\nThe stars that are earned from completing the level depends upon on how much time is left on the timer.\n\nThree Gold star is when the time has not gone pass the arrow. Two Silver star is when the time has gone pass the arrow. One Bronze star is when the timer is completely empty.\n\nReplaying any of the levels will improve the game score and the amount star.\n\nThere are few special bonuses: Freeze Time, Worker Movement/Work Speed, Additional Worker and Increases Resources. All of these special bonuses has a certain time limit but they can be used again once the bar fills-up. These special bonuses are very useful when the game is being played on expert mode.\n\nI don't think that this game much of replay value to it. If you're into time management games then you might find this game somewhat enjoyable to certain extent.\n\nReviews for other games of this series:\n12 Labours of Hercules II: The Cretan Bull\n12 Labours of Hercules III: Girl Power","June 23, 2015","true","15.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","2"

But let's talk about the game itself.\n\nThe art style is alright, it has this cheery cartoonish style typical of casual games and/or mobile ports. A new level can often look really overwhelming because there's stuff EVERYWHERE so it can take a while to even realise where the objectives are and how you should reach them. The timer doesn't start until you click for the first time though so you can plan things out if you like.\n\nThe music is catchy, if a bit repetitive. But seeing as you can finish the whole thing in 5 hours or so, that's not a huge deal. The voice acting in the cutscenes made my brain hurt though, the guy was trying WAY too hard to sound intense.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's really easy (possibly because I played on the lower difficulty setting) most of the time - what you need to do is just click everything that's clickable at the moment and you're likely to get gold time even without thinking about anything. Some levels do require some strategy (i.e. deciding what to spend your resources on first) and you can even lose a few of them (by 'lose' I mean 'reach a state in which they can't be finished'), but the difficulty remains quite forgiving until the very end. Just keep clicking. Which is exactly as repetitive as it sounds.\nThe minigames are a joke, by far the easiest part of the game.\n\nSo yeah, if you feel like you have just a few too many hours of time on your hands and want a casual game that won't require you to use your brain too much, this could be the thing for you.","December 31, 2015","true","5.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It is a bit interesting to see no plot from something based on mythology, but ‘12 Labours of Hercules’ is still a good game for its genre.\n\nLong version:12 Labours of Hercules is the first instalment in a fairly successful line of time management games that are supposed to be based on the mythical jobs of Heracles, the famous Hellenic hero. I say “supposed to”, because none of the games have actual stories, the myth is used as a visual theme only.\n\nThe mechanics are fairly simple: you gather three types of resources with your servants in order to remove a set of obstacles. When the road clears, you gather more resources, ad infinitum, until you finally reach the end of the path. For some added variety, sometimes you need the help of Hercules himself or one of his mythological buddies.\n\nAs for most time management games, the difficulty balances on a very narrow ledge. It is rather easy to pass a level within the basic time limit, but reaching the more constrained goal can be– pardon the pun– a Herculean task. Be ready to constantly retry several levels until you learn the only working sequence. On the plus side, this easily boosts an average play time of 2-3 hours into well over 6-8 hours.","August 10, 2015","true","8.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

Repetative, yet it feels all right here, can't remember myself being driven into bore even once. I beat all four games 100% on expert difficulty and still wouldn't mind to see the fifth.

В принципе они достаточно однообразны, но здесь это не кажется недостатком, не помню ни разу чтобы это как то обломало интерес к игре.  Полностью прошел все четыре на экспертной сложности и не отказался бы от пятой. С учетом того, что сами игры далеко не из списка моих предпочтений (по крайней мере не были))), вряд ли я придумаю способ высказаться об игре в еще более позитивном духе.\nВ общем, если вы подыскиваете что-нибудь достаточно увлекательно-развлекательное, при этом не слишком сложное, но тем не менее бросающее определенный вызов вашим способностям в пределах разумных затрат времени и сил - то это как раз то что надо.

Basically I wanted to farm the cards while checking what the gameplay was about. First, I read about difficulty levels on the forums, and decided to play at the hardest difficulty. After a few levels, I was hooked and couldn't play anything else until I completed all levels and earned "gold" award on each of them.\n\nYou basicallly have to gather ressources and complete certain tasks such as building stuff, clearing the path, etc, each costing ressources (food, wood, gold) in the most effective order you can come up with. The objective is to beat the timer to get bronze, silver or gold rating. The game has 40 levels taking roughly 5-6 minutes to complete.\n\nAt first glance (and all game long at easier difficulty level I suppose), the strategy required is not very challenging, you can very well play this game to relax. But if you want to get the best rating and the hardest difficulty level, it's another story. Every second count and you must usually try a few or several times before you can understand how to get the gold award.\n\nReplay value in my opinion is very low once you complete all levels. But the game is so cheap and a lot of fun so it's totally worth it, in particular if you can get it for less than a dollar. I already had the first 3 Hercules game when I wrote this, and I'm looking forward to play them all at some point.\n\nEdit: fixed a typo","March 12","true","16.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Serious! Dead Set!\n\nI bought the game for 14 cents and sold the badges for 15 cents. That's a 1 cent profit.\n\nHaving said that I have spent 8 hrs on the game for my 1 cent profit. Think I need to get another more higher paying job.\n\n12 labours of Hercules is done by these people http://jetdogs.com/projects/  and the game ofcourse is very loosely based on the Greek Myth of Hercules the greatest of heroes who after becoming mad and murdering his wife and sons goes off to find some sort of penance for his actions by performing 12 incredible labours. In the game it states that he does it in order to bring his wife back from hades, but in the real myth side of things it is simply only for penance for himself.\n\nCheck out the wikipedia if your interested in the real story... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labours_of_Hercules\n\nHaving said that it's quite creepy to see how much Hercules is smiling in the game knowing he has just killed everyone he ever loved. Seriously... his smile is so big from ear to ear that your kind of amazed that half his head doesn't just lift straight off. Sort of like the smile you would have on your face when you've just had one of those heavenly bowel movements in the toilet, thanking the dear Lord the ordeal has just passed.\n\nThe game is a time/resource management game. I haven't played many of these as I have had personally many bad experiences with these types of games on Facebook. Normally on facebook the time criteria's are ridiculous and the powerups involve micro transactions. Here quite the opposite with the developer giving you 1 cents. The objective is to simply order his servants around to perform and manage different tasks so you can get to the overall goal in a gold timely manner. The tutorial explains everything nicely and will have you feeling at home in no time. Hercules most of the time just lounges around expecting people to fan him and drop grapes in his mouth like the true hero he is. Now that sounds like a good job. How do I get that one? Do I have to murder people to get that job? Having said all that, Hercules does do some work as he is the one which will be required to vanquish four bosses/mini games while intimidating them with his eternal grin which all garden gnomes would be in envy to imitate.\n\nOver all the game is quite pleasant to play, fun and the art cartoons quite entertaining to the eye. Worth the 1 cent in your pocket when it goes on sale.","December 26, 2015","true","8.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","3","4","3","0"

I saw they had a pastry setup as well. Their public house was more upgraded than mine, thus they had all the townsfolk flooding their establishment. I noticed that they were saturating the market with their stock they were producing, driving down the prices of porridge/wheat beer/weak beer.\n\nThis led me to suffering great losses each turn due to me paying wages without making sales. But alas, I owned the only croft in town. I locked my doors, refused to sell them the precious wheat and beets needed to craft their mind numbing nectars. I watched as the remaining stock prices in the market for wheat/beets went through the roof. The Klippingens were paying top dollar for the last pidly remaining scraps of wheat they could get their hands on.\n\nFour years passed without me once opening my stock to them. After they sold their remaining product for mere pennies, they had no choice but to close their doors and put their establishments up for sale. I was just a lowly pub owner myself though, barely supporting my wife, daughter, and employees. How was I to afford acquiring their business's?\n\nAfter nearly being forced to sell my own home to feed my family, it dawned on me, "we have a guild house that gives out loans". I immediately ran over to the guild house, and borrowed whatever money they were willing to lend me. Sadly, although they knew me as an honest man, I hadn't yet proven myself as an intelligent business man. They only loaned me enough money to buy the other public house (sealing the fate of my competitor forever), with enough change left over to take my family out to dinner that evening.\nThis wouldn't work for me however. I had failed my family too many times, I refused to take them on "one night of fun" in exchange for a mediocre life. I instead bought that public house, and left my wife and daughter sleeping that night. I wandered the streets for hours, watching my shadow chase me from dark alley to dark alley, looming over me like a curtain of failure. It was on my walk home that I crossed paths with an out of work rogue from the next town over.\n\nHis name was Corwin Fielding, he was but 23 years of age. Agile, strong, confident - if somewhat arrogant. He offered me absolution that fateful night, he offered me the pride I had been searching for all these years. I didn't ask questions, I just gave him the remaining money left from the loan and the purchase of the Prancing Pony (public house).\n\nWhen I woke in the morning it had all felt like a dream. As my wife prepared my porridge before I left for work there was screaming through the streets. I went outside and stopped a man carrying a bucket of water, I asked him what all the commotion was. He explained to me that the pastry shop at the edge of town had burned down last night. It happened so late that no one was around to put out the fire or seek help, he explained.\n\nThe owner all but abandoned the building and I was able to take title of the pastry shop. I ended up hiring Corwin on fulltime as my personal escort. It made me feel more important in town, and it felt like the right thing to do after all he had just done for me. My competitor lost all of his business's in one single day...I was victorious.\nThings were quiet from then on. My wife raised our daughter well, my business's flourished. I was the life blood of the town, my farms provided the resources needed by my tavern and bakery to make the goods needed by the towns people. Life was good.\n\nSometime after my daughter finished her apprenticeship at my tavern, I offered her- her own way in life, my croft. She gladly stepped up and accepted the gift from me, she wanted to breed cattle as she heard the capital city was thriving with this new meal called "roast beef". I was proud of her ambitions and supported her venture.\n\nMy daughter was 20 years of age the night she decided to stay and work the corral after she sent her staff home. She wanted to put in a few more hours to get the last load ready for transport to my tavern. It was on this night that the Klippingen family decided they wanted their retribution. They sent a group of "thugs" to my daughters corral "The Flying Unicorn". After they beat her mercilessly, the father, Peter Klippingen stood over my daughter, drew his dagger, and cut her throat in that very corral she worked so hard in.\n\nMy wife fell ill four years later, and she passed on a cold winter night. They say it was the plague, but I believe it was her broken heart that finally did her in. She was always attached to our little Marie, from birth she did her best to raise her well, and be as loving as possible. Although she never spoke it aloud, I feel she never forgave me for what happened to our Marie.\n\nLife has to continue, for our family, for our dynasty. I had to go back to work, hire someone to take Marie's place on the farm, keep things ... normal. I eventually remarried, to a learned woman, a scholar of all things. She too had suffered loss in her life, it almost seemed meant to be. We eventually bore a son, she let me name him Junior. Our dynasty was yet again flourishing.\nMy new wife never made me hide my past from Junior, he was raised with a firm understanding of the transgressions we suffered early in this town. Junior decided to attend an apprenticeship at a different guild, the guild of rogues. His reasoning was that he wanted to run tolls to help keep bandit activity away from our town. I reluctantly agreed.\n\nIn my wifes later years, with Junior out of the house, she decided to enter politics, something she seemed born to do. She excelled in the local town meetings, moving up from one position to the next. I was happy for her, as I knew it was something she was very passionate and gifted at. My business's were booming at the time, so I had no quarrels with funding her political aspirations. Before we knew it, she had been elected Village Reeve, a position right below that of Mayor itself.\n\nAround this time Junior had completed his apprenticeship and returned to us a man. He requested that I relieve Corwin of his escort duties, explaining he deserved better than that. Corwin seemed eager to join Junior, so I didn't hesitate, an old brute like that didn't deserve to be following me around all these years later.\n\nMy wife approached me one night and asked for my support in her running for Mayor. This was a sensitive subject because it was Peter Klippingen whom was our current Mayor. She promised me it would be okay, that she would be safe. She explained to me how she had made some good friends in town, and things were more sophisticated than when I first arrived and had my falling out with the Klippingen family. Everything was political now, she said reassuringly.\n\nThe night before the elections we all gathered at my house for a massive feast, I spared no expense. That night, after all the guests had left, Junior came in and asked me about his sister. We sat up till well after 11pm talking about my baby Marie, he was intrigued to learn about her, and obviously saddened by her passing. Him and Corwin left to run errands I'll never forget the morning of the elections, on the doorstep to the Assembly House lay Peter Klippingen. His throat slit ear to ear, blood as thick as the porridge I serve at the Inn. The townsfolk almost seemed relieved by this sight. People running up and down the streets...as if they were celebrating. It was voted, and agreed that the elections would still be held, life had to continue after all.\n\nMy wife won the election for Mayor, due to the recent passing of Peter, and she was the only eligible candidate. Our town soon became a city under her watch, things again were going great.\n\nNo one knows for sure what happened to Peter, but reports indicate he was seen accepting m","December 20, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It was at this point, that I decided to play the game through to 100%. 34 hours played, all levels completed in gold time, all achievements unlocked. Rather simple game, each level besides one or 2, are easily done in the gold time, the only level I struggled on, was level 2.3, Hanging Bridges, which took me about 100 attempts and was a bit of a pain, and my last level to get gold. Besides that one level inducing my rage levels beyond 1000, i enjoyed playing this simple, well made game. Also the little cut scenes inbetween every 10 levels are entertaining, the voice over fits the scenes perfectly, and the ending challenge rounds, spilt the game up to make it not as grindy on the levels.

Hades has kidnapped Megara, and it is up to Hercules, and especially his servant, to travel ancient Greece to save her.\n\nPros: While Hercules is taking a nap, you order his servant around in single-screen puzzles, where you must reach your objectives within a set time limit. The point is to optimize the order in which you pick the resources and accomplish tasks that consumes those same resources, tasks such as fixing the path or upgrading buildings that generate resources or supply additional servants. As you progress, you will get access to a few bonus powers, and gather allies such as the Medusa, the Pegasus, the Cyclops and the Cerberus, each of which can defeat enemies blocking your path or accomplish special tasks. The colorful map is overlayed with symbols of the game achievements you accomplished, and landmarks that gets build as you get gold rating at each levels.\n\nCons: The game is extremely easy, you'll rarely ever need to restart a level to get gold rating. Due to lack of randomization, it's unlikely you'll ever replay any levels except for the slightly less easy-to-get achievements. The story really is an excuse to give the world a setting.\n\nVerdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you\n\nThis game is basic, even for a casual game, and might be a bit more challenging for a much younger audience. But keeping in mind its price, I'd recommend it for children and achievement hunters, but anyone seeking any form of challenge in a puzzle should stay clear.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","December 13, 2015","true","6.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's cheap, it's simple, it lasts some 2-4 playthroughs to complete all four "episodes" available, each one containing nine levels, one minigame section and one little cinematic. You basically have to utilize any means at your disposal (servants, Hercules, Cerberus, etc) to get rid of objects that stand in your way, thus clearing out a path to complete certain objects. I guess you can call it a resource management game, at it's core. For only 2,99 euros, you guess this tiny game that will certainly amuse the average gamer, if you do enjoy this genre.

You have workers for mundane tasks like collecting food, chopping woods, clearing paths, and have Hercules for bigger tasks like tossing boulders or buidling temples.  Each task either yields food, wood. etc., requires a certain amount of those resources, or is some combination, e.g., requiring food and wood to mine gold, which is another main resource.   The workers have to run back and forth to their little house which takes time, so the order in which you do the tasks matters.  Not only is distance the workers have to run a factor, but how quickly you can upgrade your house to get another worker, or build a farm to generate food periodically, can also have a big impact.\n\nAll in all a solid time manager that is reasonably priced at $3.  It is also available on iOS, but it is not clear whether this was a port to or from iOS since the release date (according to Metacritic) was Oct. 30, 2013 for PC, but April 23, 2014 for the iOS version.  Regardless, this game stands on its on as a PC game, while it certainly would make a good touch-based game, since you are mainly just clicking the next task for workers/Hercules to perform, the game has enough depth and variation to retain one's interest.","June 28, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

This is the first time that JetDogs has developed a Time Management game, to be honest, they have done well.\n\nIf you are a hardcore Resource/Time Management player, you would feel like you have played this kind of game so many times. 12 Labours of Hercules is nothing out of the ordinary, with simple gameplay, simple quests and similar story. The visual design is very flat and the colors could have been much more colorful. Despite that, the graphics are very sharp and quite calm to look at.\n\n12 Labours of Hercules is not a challenging game, most of the levels are pretty easy even when the difficulty keeps increasing. It is a great game fro beginners as all the objectives are clear, the controls are nice and you also do not need to wait for your workers to come back before assign them with new tasks.\n\nThe game does have all the features required for a good game of this kind though. It has voice-overs, relaxed mode you can choose to play as well as pretty exciting Boss Battles every 10 levels. We also like the Achievements this game featured, it has some standard ones as well as some unique ones that require some work to achieve.\n\n12 Labours of Hercules is based on a simple gameplay and plain designs with a couple of innovative aspects. Although it does not offer any challenges, it is a good, fun, relaxing game for those who are new to the genre.\n\nGraphics: 3.5/5 Stars\nSound: 4/5 Stars\nOriginality: 3.5/5 Stars\nStory: 3.5/5 Stars\nLevels: 3.5/5 Stars\nInterface: 4/5 Stars\nGameplay: 3.5/5 Stars\nFun Factor: 3.5/5 Stars\n\nFinal Score: 3.2/5 Stars","June 7, 2015","true","1.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

In the start of levels, there's always so much clutter everywhere, but by the time you're done with one, it's so clean, and it helps OCD people in that aspect, too.\n\nThe boss fights are fun, too. I just finished beating Hydra, and I had to shoot at crabs, extra heads, and the main thing. Very fun, and time consuming!\n\n(P.S., I got the second game too.

Your servants are the real heroes in this game. Extremely simple concept with only one mouse button required.\n\nThe game is split into 4 chapters, as Hercules chases the man who kidnapped his wife. You have a global map where each level is displayed. The game is linear--you can only go one way to get to the end. You must complete each mission in order.\n\nA typical game:\nOnce you select the mission, you begin with typically one servant and a napping Hercules. You must complete the objectives, such as collect a feather, and collect 80 gold. The mechanics are simple--issue a servant to complete a task, such as chop a tree down and bring back the lumber. The servant will do it provided you have enough of the resources required.\n\nThis is why it's a game and not a bore: Time and Resource Management. You decide what your laborers do. The idea is to plot out a strategy in which all your workers will be performing operating in harmony. For example, sometimes it will cost food to chop a tree to get lumber. You predict this and already have another worker getting the food to make up for the loss. There is a time limit, and the faster you complete the mission, the better your score. The missions can be completed any way you choose, even if you are terrible at resource management, you will find a way to complete the mission.\n\nThe game has two difficulties, casual--which I have just completed, and expert (which I will definitely be doing). For $0.29 on sale, you get trading cards worth approximately the same amount. You likely won't profit by playing this game, but if you sell the cards, you may just get it for free!\n\nI've been putting off buying the games in this series, as I didn't know if I'd like the style, but I'm finally glad I tried it, as I know I'll enjoy the others in the series!\n\nShort, satisfying, colourful, and it's something different. Go buy it.","October 16, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It will not start at all if you have Steam in Offline mode.  If you bring Steam up in online mode and then turn off your connection, then you can start it, but it warns you that you will lose all your "progress" - eg they are storing scores in the cloud.\n\nSince I could care less about "progress" per se, that's not really much of an issue for me.  But not being able to play it in offline mode from the start IS a problem.  I am frequently without internet and in need of a time killer.  This is clearly not suitable unto the cause.\n\nNow that I know, I looked for some hint of this in the game description and did not find it.  I really object to being sold a game, any game, no matter how cheap, only to find out that there are restrictions on it that prevent me from playing it offline.  This is why my GOG collection is so much larger (and older) than anything I have had on Steam to date.  I expect it will likely continue to be the case.","December 31, 2015","false","12.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It has good cartoony graphics and comes with two difficulty levels, Relaxed and Expert, each adequately describing the associated game experience.\nIn theory the player is supposed to min-max their actions, resource use and resource acquisition, in each level to beat the simple time limit or even beat the level within gold time.\nAs far as I can see, the two difficulties differ in exactly only how fast the timer runs out. While Relaxed is pretty forgiving and gold time is in reach even after a massively bad decision, Expert requires the player to know what they are doing, otherwise they usually won't make gold time.\n\n+ Ok music\n+ Good cartoony graphics\n+ Clear design\n0 Relatively short\n0 Easy "puzzles"\n0 All achievements can be gained in Relaxed mode.\n- Levels have to be learned\n\nBasically you enter each level and the game waits for your first click before it starts the timer. So the player is supposed to plan out the level without pressure, then execute the plan. Although some information is available at that point, e.g. resource consumption and production at interaction points, some necessary information is missing. Interaction points are on a path or to its side, and correspondingly an obstacle or not. Just by looking at the level layout I cannot always tell which is which. Once you click something that is not directly available the game indicates the first obstacle on the presumably shortest path to whatever you clicked. I'd rather know the last obstacle on each path to the object. Also, as I mentioned, this kind of information is only available once you click an interaction point/object thus starting the timer. Finally, a few interaction points can be upgraded. For those you simply have to learn cost development. Altogether that means, you can not really plan out a level.\n\nDespite that incomplete strategy mechanism 12 Labours of Hercules provides a few hours of okay entertainment.","August 4, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This line is choosing your difficulty and challenges wisely.\n\n12LoH is a time management game, where you collect a few types of resources (basically food, wood and gold), and with this, construct structures, enlist the help of mythical creatures and solve specific objectives. Presentation is flawless, as it looks pleasing to the eye, the sound and music are decent, and the controls are simple and intuitive. Level design is either superb or totally irrelevant - see difficulty again.\n\nSo why the duality? In a game like this, challenges can come from two sources: figuring out how to solve the levels, and solving the levels within a limited amount of time. 12LoH simply omits the first - most levels can be solved by arbitrary clicking on the screen, it's not easy to create a situation where you can't go on. As there's no challenge, walking through the game easily loses its appeal after 3 or 4 levels. So it's up to the time constraints to make the game interesting - however, you automatically get bronze for walking through. For silver, you need to finish within the par time. This is also very easy - even on expert difficulty, you'll either do it on first try, or, if you walk into a couple of traps, you'll avoid them on the second playthrough and easily get the silver medal. No challenge here, either.\n\nWhat about gold? Every level has a gold time constraint, and if you're going for that, the game suddenly comes alive! All of a sudden, you need to appraise the level's paths, judge resource requirements for the final outcome, and continuously forecast a few steps ahead to make sure your people keep moving. If they don't, then bye-bye gold medal. With the gold constraint, the levels are very good and often quite wicked. With the gold constraint, the game offers a lot of challenge. With the gold constraint, it's very much recommended, as it's tremendous fun.","August 26, 2015","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can see a little bit of game play in the video below (mind the lag as I have no idea why this game does not like Fraps/Audacity).\n\nThe cards for the game are worth more than the actual game, at the moment, and the developers are really doing a fantastic job. So, you can expect the second, third, and fourth (greenlight only for right now) to be right up your alley.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/tS3MdtW2p9Q\n","December 18, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With the help of some servants, Hercules must advance the level in order to win the game.\n\nThe gameplay itself is really simple, and for someone like me, would enjoy simply relaxing in your chair and having some game time. This really is a way to recover your recreation need. Unless you chose expert mode, you would find yourself completely focused into the screen. The graphics of this game is great, and in many ways the music is even better.\n\nI would recommend 12 Labours of Hercules to children, but anyone older can still play the game, but may find it a bit boring after a while. Though this game may be bland, it is SUPER value for its price when on sale! ($0.14) If you have spare money after buying others games, be sure to spend some money on this game to help support it, and try it out at the same time!","December 15, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Installed and thought I'd play it for a bit to test it late at night. Played it through, exit game, realised I'd played it for more than 5 hours. How did this happen?\n\nYou control Hercules' servants as the gather wood, food and gold and clear obstacles with these resources to move on to the next level with the ultimate goal of saving Herculeses' wife Megara who was kidnapped by Hades. Hercules himself chills in his hammock as his servants run about and wakes up only a few times per level to show off his strongman skills. During the game he gets help from his BBFs Medusa, Pegasus and Cerberus, each with their unique ability. Slightly mythologically incorrect, but their mechanics work well with the game.\n\nVery charming game, cute art, fun music (though it does get repeatative after a while). Simple and intuitive mechanics. A sort of 'my first time & resource management game' that is still fun for more experienced players. All achievements are easiliy obtainable and do not require parts to be played expert mode.\n\nThe 'poems' explaining the story are so bad they're good and I didn't care much for the narrator. For some reason this game does a Disney and calls Hercules by his Roman name and keeps the Greek names for everything else.\n\nThe full price is perhaps a bit much, but on sale this is definitely worth the money.","June 10, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unlike other I've played, you can get stuck without any possible way to continue (you lack a resource and they don't show up automatcally). Doesn't matter, you restart the level and pay more attention to the land.\nBtw. calling it "Labours" of Heracles is a bit too much, he spends most of the time napping and only shows up from time to time to kick a huge boulder out of the way.

This line is choosing your difficulty and challenges wisely.\n\n12LoH is a time management game, where you collect a few types of resources (basically food, wood and gold), and with this, construct structures, enlist the help of mythical creatures and solve specific objectives. Presentation is flawless, as it looks pleasing to the eye, the sound and music are decent, and the controls are simple and intuitive. Level design is either superb or totally irrelevant - see difficulty again.\n\nSo why the duality? In a game like this, challenges can come from two sources: figuring out how to solve the levels, and solving the levels within a limited amount of time. 12LoH simply omits the first - most levels can be solved by arbitrary clicking on the screen, it's not easy to create a situation where you can't go on. As there's no challenge, walking through the game easily loses its appeal after 3 or 4 levels. So it's up to the time constraints to make the game interesting - however, you automatically get bronze for walking through. For silver, you need to finish within the par time. This is also very easy - even on expert difficulty, you'll either do it on first try, or, if you walk into a couple of traps, you'll avoid them on the second playthrough and easily get the silver medal. No challenge here, either.\n\nWhat about gold? Every level has a gold time constraint, and if you're going for that, the game suddenly comes alive! All of a sudden, you need to appraise the level's paths, judge resource requirements for the final outcome, and continuously forecast a few steps ahead to make sure your people keep moving. If they don't, then bye-bye gold medal. With the gold constraint, the levels are very good and often quite wicked. With the gold constraint, the game offers a lot of challenge. With the gold constraint, it's very much recommended, as it's tremendous fun.","August 26, 2015","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ultimately, it can be cheap, but also can be surprisingly fun enough at times that I believe it's worth a try if you enjoy time management games.\n\nLike I stated, Twelve Labours of Hercules is a fairly simple time management game where you have to reach an objective, which can change between levels. There are enough different gameplay elements added in to keep you coming back, with different bonuses available for use and others. At the end of each 10 stages, you get to play a minigame, which I'll get back to later. The game lacks a clear storyline, making you wonder why you're trying reach some artifact or find Prometheus when your real goal is to save your wife. However, this game is also very easy, and it didn't take very long to fully complete the game, so don't expect a real challenge.\n\nThe main problem is that the production value can be very low at times. The drawn backgrounds look great, and the cutscenes aren't terrible either. The real failure here are the 3d graphics. They range from cheap to hilarious, and really bring down the game. Especially the minigames, which can look completely ridiculous. The sound effects for them are on the same level. Many different assets are reused frequently, and this is why the company's managed to make three more games in less than a year.\n\nAnyways, if you want a casual, easy time management game, try this out, but expect some weirder moments. You can grab this for an absurdly cheap price on sale anyways, so why not?","March 5","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is some loose story based on ancient Greek mythos but I found the "Old" style of writing to detract more from the plot and often skipped through cutscenes personally. The rough objective of the game is to get from A to B, usually by clearing a number of objects and hindrances from a map board to reach the ending and unlock the next point on the world map. Similar to many games currently on the mobile market, you can earn a rating of 1-3 stars for completing a level. Earning stars is completely based on completing the level quickly, though most missions can be accomplished with a gold rating without any real strategy or planning (this isn't a very hard game)\n\nThere is almost no challenge to the game. There is really no fighting or reflex based gameplay in the entire game, with the small exception of some very short, easy boss fights, which are kind of interesting since they all employ completely different gameplay mechanics from the actual game. (Each boss is basically a small minigame.) So far I've played the game for two 1 hour spurts, both which ended with me getting severely bored with the fairly repetitious gameplay and in this time I've completed about 60% of the game, with every level 3 starred without that much real effort.\n\nIf you are looking for something for your kid to play that you can just leave him alone with for a few hours, this is a good title to consider. Or if you like to give yourself pat on the back without really exerting any actual effort. They get stuff to click and achievements, cards and what not to give them sense of accomplishment.\n\n7/10 if I'm thinking of the children\n3/10 adults (only buy for yourself if you are looking for a casual clickfest where you can put your brain to sleep)","December 20, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The basic gist is to gather materials, clear paths, and build various buildings in each level.

So if you're looking for a good game for your kids to play or something easy to play through then this is a game for you.\n\nIf you're looking for a serious challenge you probably want to avoid this game.","December 20, 2015","true","26.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think it'd be impossible to "lose" while playing this, but getting a gold time on all levels took some thinking.  If you're looking for a different type of game, give this one a shot.

It has good cartoony graphics and comes with two difficulty levels, Relaxed and Expert, each adequately describing the associated game experience.\nIn theory the player is supposed to min-max their actions, resource use and resource acquisition, in each level to beat the simple time limit or even beat the level within gold time.\nAs far as I can see, the two difficulties differ in exactly only how fast the timer runs out. While Relaxed is pretty forgiving and gold time is in reach even after a massively bad decision, Expert requires the player to know what they are doing, otherwise they usually won't make gold time.\n\n+ Ok music\n+ Good cartoony graphics\n+ Clear design\n0 Relatively short\n0 Easy "puzzles"\n0 All achievements can be gained in Relaxed mode.\n- Levels have to be learned\n\nBasically you enter each level and the game waits for your first click before it starts the timer. So the player is supposed to plan out the level without pressure, then execute the plan. Although some information is available at that point, e.g. resource consumption and production at interaction points, some necessary information is missing. Interaction points are on a path or to its side, and correspondingly an obstacle or not. Just by looking at the level layout I cannot always tell which is which. Once you click something that is not directly available the game indicates the first obstacle on the presumably shortest path to whatever you clicked. I'd rather know the last obstacle on each path to the object. Also, as I mentioned, this kind of information is only available once you click an interaction point/object thus starting the timer. Finally, a few interaction points can be upgraded. For those you simply have to learn cost development. Altogether that means, you can not really plan out a level.\n\nDespite that incomplete strategy mechanism 12 Labours of Hercules provides a few hours of okay entertainment.","August 4, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Installed and thought I'd play it for a bit to test it late at night. Played it through, exit game, realised I'd played it for more than 5 hours. How did this happen?\n\nYou control Hercules' servants as the gather wood, food and gold and clear obstacles with these resources to move on to the next level with the ultimate goal of saving Herculeses' wife Megara who was kidnapped by Hades. Hercules himself chills in his hammock as his servants run about and wakes up only a few times per level to show off his strongman skills. During the game he gets help from his BBFs Medusa, Pegasus and Cerberus, each with their unique ability. Slightly mythologically incorrect, but their mechanics work well with the game.\n\nVery charming game, cute art, fun music (though it does get repeatative after a while). Simple and intuitive mechanics. A sort of 'my first time & resource management game' that is still fun for more experienced players. All achievements are easiliy obtainable and do not require parts to be played expert mode.\n\nThe 'poems' explaining the story are so bad they're good and I didn't care much for the narrator. For some reason this game does a Disney and calls Hercules by his Roman name and keeps the Greek names for everything else.\n\nThe full price is perhaps a bit much, but on sale this is definitely worth the money.","June 10, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's designed for mobile so what you gotta do is basically click on top of stuff to collect it or destroy it. I needed to turn on my brain on like 2 levels out of 40. Achievements are a free 100%, they are just mandatory if you complete the game, and also badge is quite easy to craft as there are 5 cards and 3 card drop.

I think it'd be impossible to "lose" while playing this, but getting a gold time on all levels took some thinking.  If you're looking for a different type of game, give this one a shot.

The story is told in some little animate clips after each 10 levels.

Visually pleasing but nothing 3D amazing\n\nOverall/Gameplay: While the mechanics of get stuff to build stuff to get more stuff can get tedious there are achivements to get (pretty easily) and power ups to help along the way. I played in easy mode just because I wasn't sure how hard it would be and never had to redo a level to get the 3 Star Time and in some levels I clearly did not deserve the 3 stars but from the repitive nature of levels it can be best this way otherwise you might burn out on it too quickly. You can get all achivements no matter the difficulty so don't worry about having to play a super hard mode if you just want a casual pick up game you can pick up, get 100% in and drop.

This was the first one.\nI really had no idea what to expect - haven't even visited store page. So without high expectations, I gave it a go.\nThe easiest comparison is Farm Freenzy - here you have to help Hercules to complete his 12 labours. To do so, you assign tasks to servants, who collect resources (Food, Supples and Gold), remove obstacles frome the road and so on. There are special characters, like Medusa or Cerberus, used to remove special obstacles like harpies or ghosts. And there is Hercules, most of the time resting, mainly used to remove boulders. So yeah. Thats it for dramatis personae.\nGame contains 4... well, lets call them chapters. Each of them has 9 regular maps and a minigame. In regular ones, you have to assign tasks to servants and heroes to complete objectives, like build farm (ah, there are buildings. They provide bonuses like additional supplies per ~15 seconds or increase amount of aviable servants), repel ghosts and so on. Minigames allow us to control Hercules, and give obiectives like shoot hydras' heads or click at the right ingredient, filling the time with shooting oncoming enemies. Nothing really hard. Well, i'm not a fan of hard games, yet this one provided no challenge.\nThere are more features, like bonuses (when bar reaches certain point, you can enable faster work, movement, more resources and so on), but making things short - this game is good. I mean for a game you wouldn't notice browsing Steam Store, but good. It's not game messiach, but it is enjoyable.","May 29","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If I had played this one first, I would have needed more convincing to pick up the rest. The later evolutions to the gameplay do make this one play fairly differently so I think it is definitely worth getting when it is on sale (which seems to be about once a month).","May 16","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
