"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/409380/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Summary:Among the Heavens is a casual game made especially for people who enjoy reusing of old casual (PopCap) game concepts and still love them. The game doesn't have any innovation but offers a nice combination of restaurant guest management (Diner Dash style) and match-3 puzzles. If you belong into this group of players, this game is a good choice for 3 euros; otherwise I'd rather recommend checking something else.\n\nPros:- Fair casual gameplay.\n- Nice visuals with 3D characters. Considering the price and the target group of gamers.\n- Voice acting. Though there's not much dialogue, it's still a pretty surprise.\n- Two difficulty modes.\n- Upgrades.\n- Achievements.\n\nCons:- Zero innovation. If you are tired of Diner Dash and match-3 games, don't spend your money here.\n- Made with 4:3 aspect ratio.\n\n\nNote: My copy of Among the Heavens was obtained for free - I won the game in a giveaway that have been sponsored by the developer. This fact hasn't changed my opinion about the game (and the review) in any way.","January 21","true","4.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

Your character has to run his little legs off pleasing the customers.  There are 5 different taverns with 10 levels each.  It starts out easy and gets difficult as time goes on.\n\nThere are different customer types.  Some have red ties which means they can only be seated in the VIP seats.  Some are impatient and will give you less money if you don't serve them fast enough.  There's even an alien that gives you a bonus if a nerd is seated after him (or near him?  I can't remember exactly).  There's a girl who gives you a bonus also.  Then there's the boss who gives you a bonus for serving him fast.\n\nSome parties of customers are so large that you have to combine tables (it does that automatically if there are empty ones available).  Though usually they come in groups of 2-4.  Oh, and some levels also have carry-out where a person will appear at the bottom of the screen and want to be served quickly.\n\nI've never played this type of game before but I have heard of them.  So I don't know how much this game differs from others like it.\n\nThe gameplay goes like this:\nCustomers enter and you seat them.  They look over the menu.\nUsually right when that first group is ready to order a new group arrives!  So either take the order first or quickly seat the next group.\nYou take the order by clicking on the table, then clicking on the stack of menus at the bar.\nThen wait a few seconds while the barman fills the drink order (I assume these are non-alcoholic since they looks like kids!)\nOrders appear on the bar with a number of the table it goes to.  Click on it and then click on the table.\nWhen the customers are done (some customers order twice) a huge pile of gold wil appear on the table and they will wave at you.  Click the table and then click the treasure chest next to the bar.\nA few seconds after you leave the table a circle will appear with a small green section and a cursor going round and round.  You have to click on it when the cursor hits the green area to get a tip.\nAfter a second or so those customers will disapper and you can seat new guests.\n\nOnly you have to do all this for multiple tables at a time!  If you take too much time you might not get paid.  I had one customer fade out before I could click to get their money.  Ugh.  And I was playing on the "Easy" setting!  There is also a harder difficulty if you really want to blow your brains out.  Or maybe I'm just not that good at this type of game!\n\nThe music is okay.  It's lively and nice to hear but it's the same for all 5 restaurants.  I would have been nice to have a different tune for each one.  The decor changes but not much else.\n\nAfter every few levels there is a simple match 3 game you can play.  It will give you power up potions for use such as: move faster, freeze time, and triple points.  If you don't get enough points you can't advance to the next level.\n\nGraphics are charming in a cartoon-type style.  Though I found it difficult to see which customers were VIP sometimes and wasted time trying to drag them to tables only to have them zip back to the line.\n\nAll in all I'd say it's a good game, especially at the current price of only $2.99.\n\nOh, and the achievements are easy to get all of them (as of right now).   They don't have the impossibly hard achievements like some games do.  So this would be a good game for achievement hunters.  It took me a little over 6 hours to finish on easy, and having to redo some levels a few times to advance.","December 7, 2015","true","6.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","4"

Your goal is to seat customers, satisfy them by taking their commands, bringing them and take their money. But it will be not easy as customers are differents. Parachutists for example don't have patience when pilots are a command twice. Also, like in Diner Dash, the colors of their clothes are important: seat them in a seat with the same color and you'll raise the points. And you can also improve your skills by making Cid faster for example.\n\nAnd you're not alone: you will find some help from your friends, even if some can throw a fit: they're calming the customers for example, if you take your childhood friend. Or they can raise the multiplier for your score, like the Old Jefferson.\n\nWhat's different from Diner Dash? Well for your tip, for example, you need to click on the table when the arrow is in the green section. You have also VIP tables (though they're the counterpart of the booked table) where you sit only people with a red scarf. Also, if you want to win potions that will make you go faster for a moment or stop the time, you have bonus levels in the form of a match-3 minigames. Take-away orders are also making it differ from Diner Dash.\n\nHowever, I've a little problem with Among the Heavens. Clicking isn't always easy, mainly with Jefferson. I click on his table but it's not enough. I have to click on him. Also, you can't choose a seat for your friends, you'll end up destroying the bonus of the colored seat for example.\n\nThe soundtrack is good and the graphics are in a sort of 3D. They're correct for a game for 3 bucks.\n\nIn other words, Among the Heavens is a nice Diner Dash-like game, with interesting mechanics. For the price, well, it's delivering a good content and fun. You can go ahead.","January 10","true","4.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

If you've never played Diner Dash, it's a bad waitress simulation game where the optimal way to play is actually to make customers wait as long as possible so you can rack up the longest chains you can. You can only chain the same move, so you must wait for all customers to finish picking their items on the menu and risk making some of them angry in order to pull a full menu combo, which you then link into a food delivery combo and then a check collecting combo. It makes it kind of a dumb waitress game, since again, this means that you're a terrible waitress, but it works as a videogame and is pretty fun.\n\nAmong the Heavens is a pretty much exact Diner Dash clone. It plays exactly the same with you clicking on pieces in a diner (in this case a potion shop in a fantasy setting), and queueing up actions for your waiter to perform as you keep track of the guests and their desires. The problem here, like I said in the beginning, is that they've thrown a bunch of stuff on the Diner Dash formula without really considering what that does to the gameplay. First off, why would I want to play a very uninspired and barebones version of Bejeweled between levels? Doing so unlocks a speed boost potion... Why? Is the game not balanced for people who cannot be bothered to play Bejeweled in their waiter game? If it is, why do the potions even exist? This is supposed to be "bonus content", but is just a pointless chore.\n\nThe worst offense, though, is that the game throws in stuff that throws your combos off for no good reason. There are customers that will order twice, ruining your chain. Customers can drop their drinks, which for some reason means you're obligated to serve them a new one instead of charging them for the busted potion bottle, and again screws up your combo. There are earthquakes that makes a random number of customers drop their drinks. There's some old man sitting in a corner who the game doesn't even explain, why he's there or what he does, he just has an impatience timer and you have to click on him and, again, ruin your combo for no reason. Maybe that guy is explained later, but in the area he shows up in, the game just tells you "yeah just click this guy to ruin the combo for no reason, shut up about it" and you're left wondering what the devs are thinking. Yet another thing that complicates combos is the introduction of "VIP" customers as well as parties larger than your seating arrangement, which makes the game move tables around to accomodate them, which in effect makes it impossible to properly plan your seating. You simply can't know in advance if a party of six is coming and if you can use the tables for four for the party of four or if you have to make them wait since they're more patient than the upcoming party of six is. That got complicated but if you've played Diner Dash, you know what I mean. The VIPs can be worked around by trying to keep the VIP tables empty, but the large parties really mess you up and make it nearly impossible to predict the perfect seating and almost requires trial and error for high scores. On top of that, the visual identifier for VIP customers is a red scarf. There are red and blue customers. You guessed it, the red scarf they're wearing is the exact same shade of red as the rest of their outfit. It's pretty bad.\n\nIt's not a bad Diner Dash clone, it works and you can click on things and serve customers and pretty easily beat the 3-star requirement for each level. It has a cute little fantasy aesthetic where you serve magical potions to people living in some kind of sky city instead of serving food to people in a diner. I did two "diners" (out of six) in the 0.6 hours I played, so it does seem on the short and easy side and the game runs in 4:3 with no option to change it, so those are two pretty big negatives. The big complaint, of course, is the broken chaining and how dull that can make the game and, ultimately, this game is a thumbs down. Play Diner Dash instead.","January 2","false","3.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

The poor kid, going by the name of Cid was constantly abused by his parents at the age of 6 in ways unimaginable. Whenever his parents weren't looking, he would run off to visit his grandfather, the "old man". He found safety in his warm embrace, and for 2 years he would visit him almost every day, even though he had to run half a mile to reach his house. But then, when he reached the age of 8, his grandfather fell prey to prostate cancer. He never got news of this. When he ran off to see his grandfather but couldn't find him, his parents found out and drove him into the city, next to a dump, to live his sad life there until he met his demise. He was soon found by Markus, the leader of a hardcore drug ring, who offered to take him into his care and teach him the ways of the world. Markus was a co-worker of Cid's mom before he got fired for doing drugs during his night shift. He heard about the kid's grandfather from her, and Markus felt touched by her story, even though the heartless monster of a mother did not care one bit. Markus decided to not tell Cid about such events until he reaches the age of 18, him being 13 now.\n\n10/10 story\nmediocre graphics","January 13","true","5.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","1"

In a lazy effort to mitigate that, they simply made the achievements so easy that everyone can 100% the game before they even see the last few levels.\n\nThe intransparent, convoluted and messy mechanics start with the handling of resources between levels, they are used to purchase upgrades, the persistence of these upgrades when you replay levels, and the persistence of powerup potions are all not really clear and not displayed anywhere on the world screen.

It's a great game; a bit like Diner Dash, a bit like Bejeweled. It uses strategy and reflexes. Because I don't want to purchase the game twice, I've only been able to play an hour on the demo, so I got through a few levels still liking the game. Would I recommend the game? Yes. Would I recommend getting it from Steam? Not right now.","November 10, 2015","true","2.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Y'know what? Both. He's a robot, and so are you. But the guy you work for? Marcus? He's also a jew.\nYou have to do all of the waiting at the tables and such to collect gold in droves for your brewman-jew in the back.\nNow here's the tough part.\nYour restaurant isn't very large, and for some reason, there're a ♥♥♥♥ ton of people flying around stopping on clouds to visit skytaverns, which are apparently somewhat popular. There's a lot of hussle to get these greedy nerds their drinks and get them on their way so the impatient folk won't bail on you before Cid can serve them.\nEveryone is an ingrate: Even if Cid is the fastest waiter in the stratosphere, you have to play a minigame for these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'s tips. Yeah, let that settle for a moment.\nSo life as a skytavern waiter isn't just a walk in the park, you've really gotta man up and pull on your big-boy pants.\nAs if this newfangled business isn't enough on your plate in this two-hands one-man many-tables more-customers balancing act, sometimes these clumsy customers spill their drinks! And you gotta go gettem new ones. SOME WONT LEAVE UNTIL AFTER THEY'VE STUCK AROUND FOR SECOND SERVINGS! and worst of all,\nA problem you will never have seen coming.\nTHE DREADED SKYQUAKES.\nYou thought earthquakes were bad? Yeah, sure they decimate cities, but Skyquakes are annoying little ♥♥♥♥♥, and all they do, IS SPILL EVERYONE'S BEVERAGES. Apparently they're more common than any establishment owner could have ever hoped. Frequent Skyquakes claim more fine china and drinks every year than the common household drunk.\nShocking, I know.\nIn whatever case, There's these nifty bejeweled style minigames that come up everynow and then, that you can complete to get power-up potions from homeboy marcus, and you can use your spare change to purchase powerups inbetween levels, to make business inherently smoother.\nthe endgoal of the game is to take over the skytavern market and monopolize the potion industry with your strong business sense and keen waiting skills.\n\nSO IF YOU'RE UP TO THE CHALLENGE, ASCEND AND BECOME THE TABLE-WAITING GOD,\nOr feel like a less ♥♥♥♥♥♥ waiter just by watching your friends play.","November 29, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Pretty good price. It has achievements and trading cards. I haven't played such games recently so I was really looking forward to it. However I couldn't play it on my 64-bit Windows 7 PC. Luckily I have a laptop which has 32-bit Windows 7 so I managed to run the game on it. What a relief. Otherwise I was going to request for a refund and was going to give "Among the Heavens" a negative review. There is a way to run it on 64-bit Windows 7 but I couldn't. Keep that in mind before buying the game. Otherwise I am really glad I bought it. Managed to get all the achievements in about 5 hours. Not bad. The gameplay is good, the music isn't bad too.
