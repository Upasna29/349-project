"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rapturepanic/recommended/209790/","rapturepanic","RapturePanic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rapturepanic/","3529 products in account","Splice is a puzzle game about manipulating genes; puzzles consist of moving individual cells into a predetermined pattern within a set number of moves. When first launched, the cells seem troublesome, erratic, and difficult to handle, but after a few sequences their patterns become obvious, allowing advanced assumptions and predictions to be made. While the puzzles start easy enough, the introduction of utility cells which can extend, duplicate, or destroy other cells slowly ramp up the difficulty. Later puzzles can be difficult, yet remain fair and can be overcome with enough thought and tenacity; this allows Splice to blissfully incorporate a nice balance of increasing difficulty without moving into the realm of the absurd or impossible.\n\nVisually and audibly, Splice truly shines. Minimal graphics and a haunting soundtrack add a surreal quality to the puzzles. Even on the more difficult levels there is something soothing and beckoning about the looks and sounds being offered to the senses. For a puzzle game, it is difficult to imagine a style more inviting or enticing.\n\nThe only deterrents are those common to the genre; if you are not immediately struck by the puzzle type there will not be a sudden change in the gameplay. The puzzles are diverse and interesting, but never leave the general concept presented from the start. Length has also been mentioned as a negative, but with the epilogue, Splice totals just under 100 puzzles which seems more than reasonable. Other puzzle games have offered nearly limitless levels, but often those levels seem to sprout from random generation and not through individually, well thought out puzzles such as those found in Splice.\n","February 5, 2014","true","4.9"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","31","36","0","3"

A good friend gifted me this game, and I was excited to it out. I was very satisfied with my gameplay experience.\n\nIf you like challenging puzzle games, uplifting/relaxing music (especially piano scores), and microbiology, then you will enjoy Splice.\n\nThe aesthetics are simple, yet offer a nice presentation with vibrant colors. All of the microbial pieces are the same shape, however, the shape you have to make varies slightly per stage. The music is wonderful - the piano pieces are relaxing and very pleasant to listen to.\n\nThe controls are very easy to learn and only require the mouse - you will utilize the left/right clicks and the scroll wheel. There is a basic tutorial to teach you how to play, and the learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your familiarity with puzzle games. The game has a very fair pace of gradually increasing the difficulty and adds new gameplay mechanics at appropriate intervals.\n\nGameplay consists of you taking pieces from a microbial and rearranging it to match a picture - the catch is you must do this within a set number of moves. "Angelic" stages signify the possibility of completing a level without using all of your allotted moves (this is indicated by an angelic portrait at the bottom left of the screen. These drive me crazy whenever I try to figure out the precise move you have to make. You can reset your level progress, or rewind/fast-forward time with the mouse scroll wheel.\n\nAs you progress through the stages, new mechanics are added to increase the difficulty. For example, one of the first new elements you will encounter is a "splitter" piece, which duplicates itself (including anything and everything attached below it) when you right-click. An "arrow" piece adds one more microbial piece beneath it when you right-click. Any right-click moves do not count as "action points," and you will actually have to do these first to solve a few of the puzzles. The latter levels add a very interesting mechanic -  the ability to break off microbial pieces and leave it floating; all levels before this require you to reattach any microbial piece you remove to an actual spot on the main body.\n\nOverall, the game is a very nice casual and relaxing puzzle game, and anyone interested in the genre will find enjoyment. Experienced and new puzzle enthusiasts should definitely give this game a try.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","April 3, 2015","true","2.3"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","15","15","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/209790/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Splice is a puzzle game in which you reposition cells in order to line up with an outline and create a biochemical strand. Cells are constrained by various rules and special cells such as those which duplicate or delete themselves, and it's in thinking around these that the puzzles are formed. There is a lot of playing with perspectives and intentionally attempting to overwhelm the player to mask a simple solution, which fluctuates between satisfying challenging and infuriating, with little middle ground and wild inconsistency.\n\nUltimately Splice's saving grace is also its downfall, and the same as virtually every game by developer Cypher Prime I've yet played, as they opt for a significant amount of style to make up for a lack in substance. The presentation is immensely cinematic, making great use of shifting planes and colors as you move from level to level, all complimented by an absolutely gorgeous piano score. It's a beautifully artistic game, but unfortunately I never found the puzzles remotely as well constructed. On the contrary, by the end I was fuming over some of the more difficult ones, and was more than happy when I was finally finished. Much of Splice's design seems dependent on confusing the player, but after a point this becomes immensely frustrating, almost as if the developers are just seeing how far they can push you without any hints or direction before you finally crack and quit the game.\n\nMy feeling on Splice are very...convoluted. The presentation is remarkable, yet the gameplay noticeably lacking. The entire time I spent with it my feelings were a mixture of awe and anger, kept only in line by a few simpler puzzles and a handy guide. I can't fully recommend it, nor can I entirely reject it, so my suggestion would be to check out the demo and see if maybe it clicks for you. If nothing else you'll get to appreciate a bit of the excellent audio and visuals, which rise so far above everything else.","August 17, 2014","true","5.8"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

Similar to how you look at the box when assembling a picture puzzle. Only instead of pieces, you have long cells. Each end of these cells can have only one or two cells attached. Think of it like -- is one cell attached to another cell, while -< is one cell that has two cells attached to it. This is what makes your puzzle look like a an upside-down tree. The root cell cannot be moved. Every other cell can be clicked and dragged to reconnect onto another cell as long as it doesn't already have two cells attached. Its easy to do, but not as easy to explain.\n\nEach puzzle is limited to how many splices (moves of cells) you can do, but there is no time limit. When you run out of splices, you need to restart or rewind the puzzle... even if you run out of splices as you finish the puzzle. The real downside is no replay value. The puzzles will always be the same.\n\nOnce you get a few puzzles in, the game will start throwing in three different types of special cells for you to master. That's where things get complicated. First up is what I'll call a dead cell marked with an X. Like every other cell you can move it, but when you click the root cell, it will remove the dead cell and everything after it. Next up is a pusher cell. When you click on the root cell, the next pusher cell down the line will push out, making a new cell attached to the pusher and turning the pusher cell into a normal cell.\n\nThe final special cell is the cloner cell, which will divide itself into two normal cells when you click the root cell. Everything following the cloner cell will be cloned as well. If there are two branches after the cloner, then there will be two exact copies. The cloner cell can be the only cell attached to the previous cell, because it splits in two. So it can only go at the end of the line. If you have multiple special cells and you click the root cell, the next special cell down the line will activate. So if you have a cloner cell 2nd in line on a left branch with a pusher cell on the right branch, that cloner cell will divide on the first click, the pusher will push out on the second.\n\nWhen things get complicated with the special cells, the game can become trial and error. You'll end up memorizing what you did to get where you are and having to remember everything you did to fail the puzzle. By rolling the mouse wheel you can easily rewind time and try again from there. Its never frustrating because of the music and the atmosphere. There is a soothing, relaxing vibe in the game. You're looking at beautiful vivid colors while trying to solve a black tree of a puzzle. Soothing subtle piano plays to help keep out the real world from interrupting your puzzle. Even the menus fit the rich art style the game has. Nothing was able to break me out of the immersion.\n\nThe main game is divided into two halves. The first half is called Origin and its split up into 7 sequences for the main part of the game, each with 7 puzzles. These puzzles are fun, easy, but they do get challenging. Once you complete the Origin main game, the credits roll and the game unlocks 4 more sequences of 7 puzzles for the Epilogue half of the game. These puzzles are far more difficult.\n\nFor me, this was about 2 or so hours worth of 49 puzzles. They felt just challenging enough to get stumped on some of the later ones, but still overcome. The 28 after that were just too difficult for me, but that's me and not you. Perhaps if I enjoyed the game more I'd tough out the others. Replaying the game only went by faster. There's just no replay value once you're done. Splice could come out with puzzle packs for the the fans out there, its only 24 more puzzles until 101! I recommend the developer's other game Fractal much more than this.","January 27, 2015","true","3.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

The music and aesthetic of the game provide an almost ethereal feel to the player as they play it, kind of a trippy, mind-effecting theme going on.  Playing it reminded me of the Cylon Basestar section of the Battlestar Galactaga series.  For that alone Splice is worth playing, but the gameplay is so polished, the graphics are so sharp, and the music is so excellently packaged together with everything else I'd say it would be a shame if you didn't at least give Splice a try.  I was extremely impressed with this puzzler and, while not the most head-scratchingly difficult puzzler I've ever played (it has a rewind feature a-la Braid so you can work on puzzles for as long as you want without penalty) the puzzles aren't easy and there are a lot of variables that can make you pause for a moment to think about your next action.\n\nThe gameplay of Splice is quite simple, easy to pick up, hard to master, as I always say of good puzzlers.  You have a bacterial strain and move the pieces around to try and fill the silouettes provided on each level.  There are "special" sections of the strain that do various things, like extend, or split the strain, duplicating the amount of cells you have.  You have a lmited amount of moves to complete the puzzle; however, using "special" sections of a strain don't cost a move to use, so that adds an additional layer of strategy to Splice.\n\nEven if the puzzles were bad (which they're not), just playing this game is a nice, chill, experience.  The feeling I got while playing it reminded me a lot of playing Flow, the ambiance this game exudes is just otherworldly and really the biggest selling point of this game for me.\n\nCome for the puzzles, stay for the experience.

Spice is a good puzzle game but it shines in the atmosphere and design which engrosses the player. Each puzzle is solved in a few steps but there are a few challenging puzzles at the end that required thinking and planning, not possible with only trial and error. Beautiful and well produced, the interface is minimal but Spice runs responsively and smoothly. Rules and strategies are introduced in the levels but that is about the first third of the whole game, which means the game is short.\n\nSplice could have been improved by a slower, more punctuated pacing. The game really does need more levels, especially when the high difficulty puzzles showed how complex and cerebral the puzzles can be. It also would be greatly helped with a save feature that remembers your moves in previous attempts across sessions (the game only remembers which puzzles have been solved). For a future game the team should be more ambitious and open the game to user created content.\n\nI recommend this game not only because of the relaxing atmosphere, but also the nature of game play. The limited number of moves allows for starting a puzzle in the middle of the day, relaxing in the atmosphere while easing into a new puzzle, but not being tied down when something comes up or running short on ideas. When I found it challenging, I went back to my day and came back to the game later afresh, and usually a new perspective would be my ticket to solving the puzzle. It is a nice parallel with how some decisions and obstacles can be tackled in the real world.","January 20, 2014","true","6.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

This was a game I got in a bundle and was pretty much 100% that I would never even play, let alone finish.\n\nThere’s many great things about this game and I guess I’ll start with the visuals.\nSplice is lovely‘n’bright and full of colour. It’s just great to look at, plus there’s a really nice feeling to this game which the music also contributes a lot to. It’s calm and casual to play but not short of a challenge, that’s for sure. The mechanics are great, and the whole concept works well with them. You use different little cells with different ability’s to solve the puzzles, and it really makes you think about what you are doing. Towards the end of the play through my head really did start to hurt, but the game is so pretty and interesting I would always be coming back to it. I was motivated enough to want to complete this game, and that is a LOT coming from someone that usually hates puzzle games and gives up after the first few levels.\n\nIt is a fairly lengthy game for an indie, seven levels in each sequence (I think) and seven sequences for the main game, plus an extra 4 sequences in the epilogue series. It may take a little bit, depending on how good you are with the puzzles of course, it personally took me just under 6 hours play time over the course of a few weeks or so, so it isn’t a game you can whizz through in an hour or two (unless you are insanely good at the puzzles), but in all fairness I think it’s worth the time and experience. It’s a great game and I would recommend it to anyone that wanted to try something a bit different.\nI would also recommend Cipher Primes other games to.\n\nAll in all, awesome game.

Solving the Angelic Strands (completing a level with an extra move remaining) was fun and rewarding.

The graphics and overall visual style make it fun to interact with the puzzles and are just visually pleasing to watch. The way the mechanics are slowly introduced prevent it from being too frustrating.\n\nWhat makes the puzzles especially engaging is how it plays as they become more complex. In some puzzle games, it just becomes an invitation to "brute force" a solution, which is not very fun and tends to be frustratingly boring. In this game, however, the puzzles each seem to have several "insights" that you can discover as you play around, which you can then use to develop a solution. The rewind mechanic makes this discovery process much easier and more pleasant - for example, if you find all of your splices used up but your result is really close to the end goal, you can rewind and keep trying different things to try to "fix" your splices until you get the answer. You can also take the approach of trying to discover useful properties about each puzzle as you experiment with different splices and exploit those properties to devise a solution.\n\nSo, not only are there multiple solutions - there's multiple, challenging and rewarding strategies you can take to discover those solutions without using brute force.\n\nOne downside is that the music seems to have only one track and is too short and played too often, however, which gets a bit annoying after awhile.\n\nAnd despite beating the main game in 4 hours, I'm sure you can get a lot of additional play time out of the bonus levels (the "epilogue").","November 4, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It'll help keep you calm when you reach the absolutely maddening levels near the end.  There are also some challenges built in in the form of "angelic" solutions, meaning you finished a level using less than the allotted number of splices and those can be just as maddening.\n\nOverall, quite a fun game though frustrating at parts.

It puts you strate in the action, starting simple, but as it adds a new element into the mix each "sequence" (about 7 puzzles), it quite quickly gets to a point where it makes you think.\nNo story at all as far as I can see, but that's fine, it means this game really is just a nice looking puzzle game, nothing more, and that's just what I want at times.\nCan't speak to length, having not finished it, but like all of the genre, offers a lot more play in going back to old puzzles, looking for that better way to do it. The game encourgages this, what with giving you an "Angelic" rating for the best (I assume) solution.\nIf you loved games like SpaceChem for the actual puzzling elements, then you should hopefully love this.","July 31, 2012","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was only after the 2nd level that I really had a handle on how the different special cells worked. I can't say I've played anything like it before so its originality is a plus. Although the music is a very harsh allegro piano solo that ends up being more annoying than soothing. It doesn't help when I'm trying to work a solution out in my head.

The concept is relatively simple, fill in the outline of each cell line with your individual cells which propogate either 1 or 2 children.  The game has very attractive graphics and an average ambient piano music to complement it.  Both the Steam Overlay and widescreen modes are also natively supported.  Unfortunately, Splice is marred by the lack of a tutorial, presenting you with new cell types without telling you how to interact with them or what they do.  The result is a frustrating experience of trial and error with a difficulty level that has sharp peaks and valleys.  While I was able to easily complete the first stage, by the second stage I was presented with puzzles that I absolutely could not figure out.  Had the game done a better job of explaining how to  play I probably would have gotten more enjoyment out of it.  As it stands, Splice is an attractive but flawed title.","June 13, 2012","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And for the more advanced puzzler, some puzzles can be solved with less clicks, called Angelic.

A good one to save for a sale day.\n\nRecommended for:  casual puzzle gamers, especially those who want to try something a little outside the usual format.\n\nDon't do it if:  you really want a brain-wracker of a puzzle (Splice's are usually pretty straightforward, once you figure out the basic moves), you need more than an hour or two of gameplay to justify paying for a game (as there's not yet a randomly generated puzzle feature, so once you've done all the puzzles there's not any ongoing challenge to come back to).","February 6, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like that there's thematic coherence between the gameplay & the aesthetics. Functionally the puzzles operates on a 2D plane yet the game uses 3D space to move from one puzzle to the next, with the previous puzzle still visible as if you're inside the... DNA or whatever. Science right who even understands that ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe first couple sequences were interesting, I sort of powered through them without really understanding what was going on. I never really had a moment of epiphany. I was just playing without knowing what I was doing and later on I realised I knew what I was doing. Judging by some other reviews, not everyone figures out what to do lol.\n\nFinished the main 7 sequences in 2hrs which for $10 or $5 is totally ok with me.

Each set features its own coloring.\nOnce you complete the 7 standard sets - Flight of Angels, go back to the main menu to unlock the epilogue sets - Algorithms and Angelology.\n\nThe game features Cipher Prime's signature: great music to go along with deceptively simple game mechanics.

You go through strands in various sequences, starting from forgivingly easy to mindwreckingly hard.\n\nSecrets inclusive! Do you have what it takes to push the boundaries even more? Angelic splicing is the key!\n\nGraphicsThe visual design of the game is surprisingly astonishing with awesome animations and an overall beautiful visual design.\n\nSound & MusicThe piano soundtrack of the game fittingly underlines the beauty of the game, even if it can get repetitive, if you play for too long (which you will, this is a puzzle game, duh).\n\nWeakpointsI deemed some of the puzzles way harder than others, some are simple realignments, some felt like thinking around 4 corners ahead (given the same difficulty level). Mixed difficulty is ok, but some puzzles who were not far away from each other, in terms of sequence, really made my head spin.\n\nNo Options within the game. You cannot turn down the volume in the game.\n\nThe tutorial section of the game falls really short and is pretty shallow, I got the hang of the game after the first sequence. If you still need help even after trying everything you could, seek help in the forums.\n\nConcluding ThoughtsBeautiful game, both visually and auditory. Mixed difficulty on puzzles. Secrets and extra content inclusive. Garanteed Content for over 6 hours.\n\nModern DNA-Testing? 149€.

Aside from the few "potential angelic" levels (ones where it's possible to solve with less than the allocated splices, which may take redoing that specific level a time or two), and a few sticky ones that can be frustrating, you'll just blitz through in a few hours and shelve it. That said, it's engrossing, and you will easily lose those few hours in one sitting before wondering who fiddled with your clock.\n\nIt does have a tendency to dump you in the deep end: there's no tutorial, and new specials are simply dropped on the first strand of each sequence so it can be frustrating simply not knowing the tools to solve it rather than due to the puzzle's difficulty. That's especially true with the first special where you're not told to right-click to activate when you've been drag-dropping before, or when you first get two specials at once and have to intuit that the slightly shinier one will go first regardless of where you click. However, there's a finite number of specials, and only drag-drop and right-click as controls, so it's doable, just would be nicer with a wee pop-up first time to say "hey, do X and Y happens!" to make it a little smoother.\n\nThe graphics are pretty, and incredibly smooth for what it is. I do also like how uncluttered the screen is so there's nothing to distract from the puzzle at hand. The music and effects sounds, similarly, are non-invasive: nothing spectacular, but they're inoffensive and relaxing - and if I'm honest a little bit hypnotic, which feeds into the "I can't leave my chair until I do just one more strand" aspect of it - without being too elevator-muzak-y. Suits the game perfectly.\n\nOnly glitch I've found is that it does not like windowed mode, in fact none of the graphics show up so you just get a background, tinkly music, and bloops as you click blindly at the ninja-genes. Annoying, but not game-breaking, as long as you, y'know, play in not-windowed mode.
