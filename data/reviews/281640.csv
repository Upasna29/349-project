I think it's obvious that it's a direct sequel to Banner Saga.\n\nThe game is great, the characters and their abilities are even more original in this one. And I hope we will see Banner Saga 3, even if it's going to be "the same" - I will still play it.\n\nPS: One of the characters is literally based on Thomas Middleditch's face.

This review will analyze the amazing amount of fun I had in my first playthrough (many more to come) of TBS2 and the moments that were less than pleasant. I aim at comparing the second game's structure to TBS1, and measuring the good, bad changes. Alright lets break it down.\n\nStory Very much drawn up like a Tolkien-esque world, Banner Saga 2 plays out like the Two Towers of Tolkien, great fantasy writing accompanies the 2nd novel in a great trilogy that builds up to an upcoming climax in the third. Although it stumbles in a few places, the story proves to drive this epic adventure well into its second episode. The story starts off at a meager pace and suffers from bogged down streaks of fighting(explained in gameplay section).  However, these negative aspects are QUICKLY and STRONGLY forgotten when thrown into the heat of the carvan's struggle of getting to one story sequence after another. Tolkien's Two towers is the worst of the best and the same can be said for this game. The first Banner Saga had a more complete narrative that was well supported by its characters and driven by tension from one scene to the next. Banner Saga 2 struggles to build tension or as intense interest in the beginning than the first game did, but with the option to start where your clan left off, this breathes continuity in the epic and gives it a semblance of being one game. Because of this, the first saga helps drive the second extensively. It does not fail to set up a Banner Saga 3 to outperform this entry in the series.\n\n+Great story is continued\n+sets up for a climactic finale\n-story does drag in the beginning\n--- 8.5/10 ---\n\nCharacters The old group is back headed by the two protagonists Rook and Iver. These characters that are brought about from the first installment led with remarkable chemistry prompted by great writing. Unfortunately,   many supporting characters don't get the screen dialogue time to continue developing themselves and create the sense of a united clan that was present in the first game. This is because the cast of characters grows too huge during this game and many characters were left behind either too late in the game or appeared not enough. Many new characters are ho-hum and plagued with some poor character designs that mimic the original cast slightly.  Its only a select few of new characters that shine through and represent the new regions visited. These select new characters bond and become a part of a character driven exchange that works well with the story.\n\n+Original characters are great\n+A dynamic interplay between characters\n-Too many new dull characters\n-lack of further development in some older characters\n--- 8/10 ---\n\nGameplay The gameplay consists of leading a clan across the tundra and forest making decisions that effect the outcome of the story and the survival of the clan. When battle ensues, characters can be chosen to fight in a tactics style form of combat. Gameplay differs from the original in a few good ways and many uncessary ways. Firstly, the caravan system is now unbalanced. With the ability to find food far more easily and obtain renown especially too easy, management of food is almost never a problem. More renown is gained every battle, almost exponentially as the game goes on and this plays to TBS2's detriment. This leads to mass upgrading of characters and not as great care to tactical upgrading. The renown needed for upgrading is also designed incorrectly. The satisfaction of leveling up a character and feeling as if a distinction exists between levels is muddled. I found myself with the majority of my characters being able to level up 3-4 times in a row because of the previous kills that carry over to the next level. This also led to most of my characters being OP throughout much of the game and very little difficulty in combat. Combat soon became tedious at parts because battles would consist of enemies that presented no challenge at all for stretches of the game. The great aspects of the combat are still there however, and thats what makes this game's battle system amazing despite the related shortcomings.\n\nEDIT: I played this game on normal and that should represent the adequate balance of difficulty and story telling. But in the end, the combat was too easy.\n\n+original combat has not changed\n-leveling and character progression is shoddy\n-difficulty has been nerfed from the last Banner Saga\n-last fights proved to be far too easy\n--- 7/10 ---\n\nPresentation The main aspect of this game that makes it great and separates it from every other game is and always has been -- its presentation. The atmosphere created by its authentic Celtic/Nordic music and a throwback art style that is captivating and adds so much to the game. The art is beautiful and haunting when it needs to be. The characters are represented well save for a few new characters that look awkward.\n\n+Music is perfect\n+animation is classic and unique to games of this day.\n+Creates an atmosphere that is an ensemble of perfection\n-New characters have questionable designs\n--- 9.5/10 ---\n\nConclusion The second Banner saga was amazing and amped up the story to an amazing height that can only get higher in Banner Saga 3. It was easy to tell when the first Banner Saga came out that it would turn into something awe inspiring and it has. A game I immediately want to play after beating it is a rarity for me, but now it just seems ritualistic to me with Banner Saga. Don't hold out on this one, it is one of my favorites and the game is truly a gem.\n--- 8.25 --- TOTAL SCORE\n\nEDIT: TBS2 is by no means a perfect game, and the story is very well constructed, its gameplay is poorly integrated at times and the 2nd game is a step down from the previous. This game deserves more criticism than it is getting and the amazing story should not blind the analysis of the game as a whole","April 20","true","17.0"," 50 of 54 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","50","54","0","2"

It might be the entracing music, the Disney quality hand-drawn art, or perhaps it's the fact that everytime I play this game it's always 30 minutes later than I expected it to be.\n\nThe combat is simple, for the uninitiated. As you begin to dive into the character types, their respective special attacks, and equipable items, you'll soon realize that there is a depth to the combat that will keep you coming back. When the odds are seemingly against you, and you do in fact manage to reduce your foe to a single unit vs. one or more of your own, you will feel like a champion. A real champion.\n\nWhat has surprised me the most about The Banner Saga is the number of choices and chances the game allows. Every combat decision, every discussion, every step on the map brings consequences.\n\nI can't tell you whether or not you should buy The Banner Saga, but I can tell you that you would almost be a fool not to."\n\nEven though I've (so far) only played Banner Saga 2 for an hour, I am happy to tell you that 2 years later everything I adored in TBS1 is alive and well in TBS2. The art, the music, all of the hard and rewarding decisions are back.\n\nAnyone that loved The Oregon Trial, enjoys turn based combat, or just wants to experience a really well made game should pick up The Banner Saga 2 now.\n\nOh, and your save from TBS1 can be imported. If you didn't play the first (and I highly recommend doing so!) you can press a Recap button on the main menu to get up to speed.\n\nI look forward to playing this game over the next 15-20 hours and salivating over The Banner Saga 3 for the next year+ :)","April 19","true","3.5"," 65 of 80 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","65","80","5","0"

It's more of the same great art, music, and gameplay, with a few new features and, in my opinion, an even better storyline. If you haven't played  the first, you ABSOLUTELY need to play that before this one. While it does a good job of explaining the story so far at the beginning, I imagine that it wouldn't be nearly as good without having played the first one. That said, the two are similar enough that if you don't like the first game you probably won't like this one either.","April 20","true","11.5"," 41 of 49 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","41","49","2","1"

Up front you are given the options for importing your save or selecting one of the characters to be your main leader. As I am not of the group of people that attempt to play sequels before their former experience has been gone through I cannot speak to how approachable this is if you did not play the first Banner Saga. As for what should be quite obvious I imagine this is a highly narratively driven game.\n\nThe combat system remains very similar but is vastly improved. More classes and more abilities. Maxing a stat now gives you options to further improve that stat. Options like Robust or Divert. Being a percent chance to resist strength damage and avoid armor damage respectively. Among many other ways to specialize.\n\nYou lead your caravan as you did in Banner Saga 1 but even this is improved. Clansman, fighters and Varl still aid you. Helping in foraging and fighting. The tough balancing act of having fighters to aid in battle at the expense of using up more supplies on the road. As well as attempting to hold some morality in the events that take place. How it is improved is that the consequences your actions are having are much more clearly conveyed to you. Including the very real effects of morale on your caravan. Training at camp also has added functionality in that you can now train clansman to fighters. Additionally there are challenges to be had in training as well.\n\nThe party also splits and is told from differing perspectives. As it seems tradition for the series.\n\nThe actual story telling is also even higher in production value this time around. Extremely well animated cut scenes and quite a bit more voice acting is present. The hand drawn art style continues to be vastly gorgeous. Though the main crux of the story is told through text.\n\nIf you enjoyed The Banner Saga 1. This game is that and plenty more.","April 23","true","16.1"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","33","37","0","0"

Well, it took me around 12 hours over three long evenings to beat the game, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to begin again very soon. At the time of writing this review, Steam says I've been playing for 8 hours, but it didn't take into account around 4 hours of game time in which I was offline.\n\nFor those of you not familiar with the games all, The Banner Saga is a series of Tactical Role Playing Games. While the game's environment is a fictional fantasy world, it is somewhat connected to the norse mythology. I don't know much about the norse mythology, but I did notice some connections, such as Hogun and Mogun, and I suppose there are others as well.\n\nAnyway, just like in the first game, in The Banner Saga 2 you alternate between leading 2 different groups of adventurers (for a lack of a better term) on their continued quest. The game is a direct continuation of the first, so while you can watch a recap of what happened during the first game and start playing the second one immediately, I really suggest playing and beating the first one first, so you can carry your savegame over to the second, and continue with the exact same party you ended the first game with.\n\nThe battle-system is interesting, refreshing but simple enough to learn. I know some people have been complaining it's too simplistic, but I don't share that view. The graphics are great and so is the soundtrack, but what makes this game so much fun for me, is the story. It's refreshingly dark and interesting. Also, the choices you make have a major impact on the game, which also means you'd probably want to play through it more than once, to explore different options and see what happens when you choose different directions.\n\nAlso, it seems like the developers managed to take some of the problematic aspects of the first game and improve them. For one, The Banner Saga 2 is much more flexible than the first, when it comes to promoting your characters. You get much more freedom in choosing which ones to level-up, which in turn, gives you more tactical options in battles.  Not only that, you also get a much larger veriaty of characters to choose from. In addition, this time there are training scenarios, in which you get to learn to use your characters' most important special abilities.\n\nI really like this game, and would recommend it to anyone who likes tactical and story-driven RPGs.","April 22","true","20.0"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","29","32","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/civilo/recommended/281640/","civilo","Venceremos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/civilo/","1569 products in account","Before you read, note that English is not my native language, so expect errors and for that I apologize in advance.\n\nLet me fill you in if you have no idea what the Banner Saga is.\n\nYou are nobody and you wake up to find the world that you and everyone once know is breaking apart. You struggle to get by and are forced to make tough calls, so that you and your people can survive. And through these choices you are bringing changes -- though small, they may escalate. I am not going to tell you the exact plot, since it would spoil the fun.\n\nTL;DR:\n+Decent story\n+Super amazing music\n+Even more super amazing art style\n-Lore not very friendly to people new to the series\n\nVerdict: Recommend, and I recommend you to play BS1 as well if you haven't played it yet\n------------------------------------------------------\nWhen I recommend BS1 to my friends I'd say "a perfect game, if not for a lousy lack of unit variety and customization".\n\nWell, it's a good thing to see this time the "if not" part gets improved greatly. While inheriting the already-interesting move-based system, Stoic put a lot of work in character development. Compared to merely investing stat in BS1, in BS2 you can get talents (passive abilities), characters get more abilities through progression and some of them got to choose one from many, which allows players larger room for customization. Even though the optimum is easy to find, it's still an amazing improvement compared to the system of BS1. Of course there are new units introduced to both the protagonist side and the enemy.\n\nNot much to say about the art style. I did enjoy the look of BS1, so here I enjoy BS2's too, and they include more cutscenes this time I think. Notably there are some more boldly designed godstones compared to mere faces engraved on a rock in BS1.\n\nMusic is composed by Austin Wintory as well. I personally prefer BS1's music rather than this one -- maybe because I know what to expect this time. I'm particularly impressed by the song in the end.\n\nThe game itself is shorter than BS1 and I see people grumble about that, but it gets more immersive this time IMO. Some say the ending leaves things hanging, but you know how a trilogy works: the first one introduces the setting, in the second things escalates and followed by the third, the grand finale. I hope I can live long enough to play BS3 before darkness consumes the world. :(\n\nAnother remarkable thing is that your save from BS1 can be imported. It's not super impressive since we all know Bioware's been doing that the whole time, but it's still decent enough: in an unforgiving world where you are forced to make tough decisions, save import reminds you that your choices have effect.\n\nI could, but I am not going to discuss in-depth since the new review showcase policy is discouraging (volvo only cares whether you give a thumb-up or thumb-down, not the decency of your writing), but I think my point is crystal clear: I recommend this game even at full-price to those who have played BS1. And for folks new to the Banner Saga, I suggest you to buy them both. Honestly, this game is amazing and it's sad to see BS2 doesn't get as much attention as BS1 did.","May 4","true","26.5"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","26","27","0","0"

Now with different goals, battlefield shape and better balanced, they inscribe themselves much better in the story.\nThe enemy variety has more than doubled (most likely tripled) with more types and a new race.\nLevels now go to 10 with a second skill choice at rank 6, getting a new unique skill for some characters and a same base class skill for others.\nOverall difficulty is better balanced.\n\nThe story feels darker and most pressed than before with big revelations .\nImporting saves from the 1st game will make you feel this is YOUR story (in a way), somewhat more to me than with the Mass Effect games.\n\nThe only part that I think needs more work would be - as with the last game - the Caravan with its clansmen and fighters.\nNow clansmen gather food which replenishes your supplies and fighters protect those clansmen, which gives a renown bonus in fight depending on the number protected.\nUnfortunately this still feels like a missed chance to make something deeper. It is better than TBS but still could be more useful and impactful.\n\n\nOverall I greatly suggest fans of good stories and TRPGs play this game, even if they haven't played the 1st (new games are well supported, balanced to be a little better than average import). I loved it even more than The Banner Saga.\n\nOh, and Austin Wintory made once more a great OST by adding more instruments (I believe) and adding the Islandic band Árstíðir to already great names (Malukah, Peter Hollens...)","April 19","true","18.4"," 38 of 49 people (78%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","78","38","49","8","0"

If you enjoyed the first one, this is a no-brainer instabuy. The story is still fantastic, and the gameplay has had a few tweak that improve it, as well as lots of new depth with the higher level characters.\n\nFor those of you who haven't played the first, go buy and play it immediately before you even think about starting this one. They're essentially parts of the same story, and you won't know wtf is going on unless you complete the part one first.\n\nNow, for slightly more detail: what you have here is a great example of what people mean when they talk about video games as art. The graphics, while not top-of-the-line 3D freakshow perfect, are gorgeous for what they are. The art stlye is really distinct, and all the characters look great. The music and sound effects are well done too, with the former appropriately mournful and exhilirating while the latter adds a lot of impact to everything the text describes. There is only minimal voicing of dialogue for key moments. Mostly, you're reading everything. Thankfully, the dialogue and plot are tremendous, really the highlights of the game. You'll make a lot of meaningful decisions, and second guess almost every decision you make.\n\nBut the combat is great too. It's a basic grid-based, turn-based system with a few significant deviations from the norm. Instead of a single health bar that needs to be brought down to zero, you've got armor and strength. The first is what protects you from damage, obviously, while the second is both your attack power and your health. So as you get weaker and closer to death, you are able to dish out less damage. This leads to a lot of interesting strategic choices, as you can attack each separately, meaning you have to decide when to sacrifice damaging strength in the short term (and thus limiting your own strength damage on counterattacks) for armor damage that will give long term benefits in future attacks. It's quite a balancing act.\n\nOn top of that, each side alternates a single attack before the other side gets to attack, regardless of how many characters are alive in each group. So a pair of fighters battles a group of six would basically each get three turns in the same time the other six got one each. This only time this changes is when a team gets down to one character, which switches combat to pillage mode. In this mode, the single combatant gets one move, then the entire other team gets to move. It's usually a quick mop up at this point. But this leads to even more complexity, as taking out weak enemies first (a staple of turn-based combat) only means the stronger enemies get more frequent attacks. Generally, spreading out damage evenly is more effective, as it means more of the enemy attacks will be weak. In fact, it's ofter better to leave a bunch of weak enemies alive instead of finishing them off until all enemies are weakened.\n\nThese twists keep combat fresh and interesting. Combine that with the story, and you've what I'm calling my game of the year so far. I only beat the first game a few months ago, and was thrilled to find out the sequel was coming out. I have no been disappointed one bit. I'm completely sucked back in and loving it.\n\nOne note: there is a third part coming, so, as with the first part, this one ends with the story still unfinished. But as they say, it's the journey, not the destination, and this journey is phenomenal. If you like turn-based combat, or good plot and dialoge, or any combination, get this ASAP.","April 23","true","28.2"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","22","24","0","0"

So the game becomes more RNG than BS1.\nYou can have for instance 10,20,30% to do a crit. or 20% to avoid 1,2,3 str damage, if you maxed out STR on a certain character.\n- New enemies: There are about 3-4 new kind of enemies.\n\nOut of combat, there is one little addition, you can now train your clansmen into fighters.\nBut this is where Banner Saga becomes so dull.\nIt doesn't matter how many clansmen or fighters you have. It doesn't matter at all.\nThey are just number/stats, that do not have any impact whatsoever.\nAnd to prove further that they are just numbers, Stoic had the good idea to let the player hire fighters on the road in flat numbers.\nFor instance, if any fighter group decide to join you, it will bump your numbers to +50,+100,+20.\nIt's like all the attention to detail to the music, lore, dialogues, etc. sucked Stoic focus, and your clansmen and fighters are the least of their concern.\nWhile... you are playing a caravan chieftain that is suppose to pay attention to its men.\nThat was the whole point... the people that you protect...\nWell, they are just numbers, so, you better prepare to role-play, because nothing in the game will support the fact that they are real number.\nEnjoy a game with 0 clansmen and 0 fighters, and the inconsistencies of the dialogue and adventure will slap you in the face.\nI think this is the biggest flaw of the game.\nOther than Iver loosing his right arm, and then switching to left, switching back to right, and left, and right...\n\nBut where BS2 really shine is for its choices/consequences aspect. It just expand over Banner Saga.\nThe way I see it.\nYou could compare Banner Saga to a growing tree with 3 branchs, those 3 branchs would reflect the number of choices you made during the game. Now, with BS2, you can add 3 more branchs on each previous branchs.\nThere are a lot more choices to make, and I would say 2 major choices are actually not tied to dialogues, but through combat.\nAlso, there are 3 different ''direct'' ending to this one.\n\n\nI would like to rate BS2 a solid 8/10, I so much want. But the problem is the constant not caring of the devs for the serie issues. None of BS1 issues have been fixed.\nHow is that possible?\nAnd for me, there are really just two issues.\nThe dull caravan numbers, and Iver's arm switching there and there.

You might say I like it a little. So I'm probably a little biased in writing this review, but I honestly wasn't guaranteed to like this game upon release, since I was mildly skeptical of some of the changes the devs had hinted at implementing. I think a lot of times when devs try to change up a formula in response to criticism, they end up creating new problems that are sometimes worse than what they'd started with (looking at you Bioware and the way you stole my dialogue wheels in Mass Effect).\n\nBut Stoic Studio, in my opinion, successfully navigated the balance between resolving criticisms and weaknesses of the first game without undermining or changing what made the original great. Every little tweak made the game better, not worse. A few important changes: the morale system  is so much clearer-- in the original game it took me multiple playthroughs to pick up on the interaction between some choices and morale shifts; the cutscenes are more dynamic and the voice-overs more frequent so that it has even more of a 'cinematic' feel (but runs in 60 fps!) in the sense of watching a classic animated film; the music is even more beautiful (was that even possible?? Austin Wintory is fabulous) and most of all, the combat is much better.\n\nI was among those who actually liked the original combat, so I was worried they'd throw the baby out with the bathwater in their promises to make it more complex (especially in response to criticisms that it wasn't enough like other turn-based strategy games). But I think I can safely say that really do think they hit on just the right notes for it. The fights and mechanics feel familiar and still absolutely approachable. It’s the same bones and sinews of combat. But the tweaks they’ve added blend with the old instead of conflicting with them — like instead of just slapping a new face on top of the the body, they gave it more muscle. They took everything that was good from the old combat and embellished on it instead of throwing it away, while trimming away the weaknesses, where I think a lot of devs might’ve said ‘people don’t like the combat? Better start from scratch.’\n\nTL;DR is: If you liked the original, you'll absolutely like its continuation because it builds on its strengths; if you *didn't* like the original, you should definitely consider giving its sequel a shot because it's fixed what made it weak before.","April 19","true","22.1"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","2"

More animated cutscenes are nice, and more interesting characters are always a plus. Shame some of the original's characters and plot threads get almost no exposure, even though i thought they would have gotten their arcs in this one.\n\nRaven segments aren't as much fun as Skogr segments but it's not a problem.\n\nYou can also get Eirik to train a war bear.

The artwork remains beautiful and even though you spend the majority of your time watching your caravan trek endlessly left across your screen, man does it look good.  The characters are also much more compelling this go around, but that might just be that it is fresher in my mind. Seriously, Bolverk and Iver and Hakon, hell all the Varl are just amazing. If you really get in the head of the protagonists, instead of choosing what you believe are optimal paths, the decision making weighs heavily on you.  At its heart, this game is a visual novel and to play it like Fire Emblem is just silly.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe Combat.  So many people like the Armor vs Strength combat thing, and its cool but it is so flawed. Turn order needs a serious rework for Banner Saga 3. I learned this in the first one, and  slogged through it in the sequel, but the optimal tactics are not the realistic ones. Often it is advantageous to leave enemy combatants with 2 or 3 strength rather than killing them, because it is better to have a weak enemy in the turn order.  I got it handed to me several times in Banner Saga 1 before I figured this out because I would one-shot all the weaker enemies and then the 2 or 3 remaining big dudes would alternate turns wrecking me.  My biggest complaint with the game.  But like I said, it is a visual novel at its core and there are only I think half a dozen fights in the game that have major story developments attached to them.\n\nNeutral:\nIllusion of Choice. This could be good, depending on your outlook I suppose. But sometimes it feels like you are at the mercy of a bad DM. No matter what you do, bad things happen to you and no decision is correct. It really plays into that hopelessness but some of the "Surprise!" bad things that happen to you are super ham-fisted.  For a decision based, heavy narrative RPG sometimes you feel at the whim of the writers. Maybe it plays into the despair more than I am letting on and it does feel like things are out of your control, but to me that wasn't always a good thing.\n\nThe Verdict: Play it.  If you haven't played the first one, its like five bucks on sale all the time.  It isn't better or worse necessarily. It's definitely an improvement, but it doesn't quite have the wonder the first one gave you. It's like Pokemon sequels. They're better, but they aren't the same.","April 22","true","14.4"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

The sequel to 2014's 'The Banner Saga', this is a strategy-RPG that picks up directly after that game's ending, and continues on with Stoic's epic Norse-inspired fantasy story.\nOnce again, you have a caravan that you guide through the world in a very 'Oregon Trail'-esque journey, where events stop you along the way and either prompt decisions which affect you and your people or prompt battle.\nWhen you enter battle, the game enters a tile-based strategy mode where you move your units along the outlined area and choose to attack or use special commands.\nWhile there is a recap you can follow from the main menu, to experience this fantastic journey fully, you MUST play the original game.  For veterans of that title, you can pull your finished game save points and load them in here, along with all of the choices you made from the previous chapters.  From there on, you can expect more of the same.  Stoic has added new characters and abilities, and while there is a bit too much hand-holding for the first chapter, from then on everything truly seems to matter.  They've also gone above and beyond their previous efforts, including many more gorgeous animations and larger fullscale art pieces for us to enjoy.\nIf you like epic fantasy, if you like strategy RPGs, or even if you're just a lover of fine art and moving symphonies, this is a great game to check out.","April 30","true","20.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Addition of new abilities and buffs improve even further on the original.\n\nCons:\n-The game commits a few sins that its predecessors didn't have by presenting you with a few rather vague choices that result in horrible actions by your main character. Now I'm not talking unseen CONSEQUENCES, those happened in Banner Saga 1 and were reasonable and exciting because your abilitiy to choose the right path was limited by how little your character knew. I'm talking about you being presented with choices, choosing the one that seems like the best one and your character going and doing something you would never want them to. For example, it's like if you had a choice:\n\n"You're at your friend's house, he's cooking apple pie, do you want some?"\n\nYou answer "no" and the game tells you, "you burn down the house and slaughter your friend's family in their beds, now safe in the knowledge that you will never be forced to eat apple pie."\n\nIt's not necessarily a massive black mark against the game since this kind of thing is present in a lot of games, especially Mass Effect, so we should be used to it now. It's just a shame that it's present here when Banner Saga 1 didn't have that issue.\n\n-Similarly, the game tends to remove characters from you by having them arbitrarily killed, flip allegiance, go off on their own mission or just simply disappear. This can be very very annoying if you invested a lot in that character and they were an integral part of your strategy. It would actually be nail-bitingly exciting if these characters died in the field because you failed to protect them, but no, the game just wisks them off into the void. Also, you don't get the items you equipped them with back. Sucks to be you.\n\n-Lastly, while the story is good, Banner Saga 1 felt complete, like The Matrix. Banner Saga 2 is very much The Matrix Reloaded (remember the absolute final scenes of that film?) and just as satisfying at the end, i.e. not at all, due to the massive unspoken 'TO BE CONTINUED' hanging over it. On one hand it means we'll get another game (yay) on the other, sucky ending (boo).","April 29","true","13.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

By hunting and foraging and thus keeping up your survavility rate! This allows you to do something that in TBS1 would be unimaginable and that is Purchasing Items from the market! Can you believe it? Well neither can I and that's just awesome!\nThere are awesome items that are worth every renown point.\nAlso random encounters generate higher morale stats which was something very rarely heard in TBS1.\n\nAlso it has as you begin the game, it explains to you with simplicity and in great detail on how the game works and how each thing works and why is it there and what it means. It's just like they took everything from TBS1 and made it a million times better and added a bunch of new cool awesome stuff.\n\nImprovements on heroes!\nSpeaking of which, now your heroes can reach level 10! And whilst in TBS1 it costed a lot of renown, now it's much cheaper. PLUS! they gave us the introduction to new perks! Perks can make your hero into a tank, regenerate will power or armor or simply become a whirlwind of death.\nHeroes can also obtain a new ability once they reach level 5/6! And this is fantastic as it brings more variations and new strategies to play with.\n\nArt Department:\nAs expected of Stoic, TBS2 explodes to unbelivable levels of Awesome and beautiful when it comes to their art department, If you thought that TBS1 was beautiful just you wait until you see this one! The journey overall it's more epic, you see more of the world and it makes you feel like you really are a part of an animated fantasy film! But in this case of a different piece of narrative and art.\n\nThe music it's beautiful and if you are fan of game/movie music I highly recommend to get the soundtrack, because it just nails it and gets "them muh feels!" I would even compare the combination of both to a Jame Cameron movie in the sense of complete immersion.\n\nThe Narrative it's way more smooth, it gets more interesting and intense. Build up from the 1st game is given fruits on this one and naturally the gae keeps branching on it. We learn more about the world of TBS and it's people. Also the new Godstones are bautiful and interesting.\n\nThis game has more replayable value than you can imagine, specially due to all of the branching that it has "not only depending on how you finished the first game" but also on the decisions that you take during this one.\nEven if the story is sort of lineal, it is really an RPG since your decisions really take a weigh and reward in this game.\n\nIt also left me wanting for more because it was awesome, and the new animation segments are great!\nSeriously, maybe you think its going to be hard but this game it's actually easy BUT! it can also be challenging if you wish it to be so! It also has many surprises depending on what you decide.\n\nSo yeah! Go for it because it was worth every penny.","May 29","true","117.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I have not finished this yet but it seems like it will be longer as much as I have played.\n\nOkay, on to the review.\n\nHOLY ♥♥♥♥.\nThis game improves so much upon the mechanics from the previous installment.  There are more levels!  One slight pet peeve of mine is that now leveling takes a good bit less renown, so I feel like I wasted a lotta renown in my last run, but thats okay.  There are new "talents" which you unlock after maxing out skills, and puts those excess skill points from more levels to use.  You can level to level 10 now.  That about covers leveling.\n\nCamp and markets are largely unchanged.  Dialogue seems a lot more tense and enjoyable in this game, which is saying something.\n\nAnyways, so the combat system is as far as I can see mainly unchanged, but its been spiced up.  There are barricades which people can take cover behind or attack to destroy. Core mechanics remain quality, and some exciting new abilites are popping up with the new recruits.\n\nI have not encountered the new race but I hold out hopes they will be great.  Will update this later when I know more.\n\nOverall so far rating of 8.9/10.  Great game, buy it if you were a fan of the first.  If you weren't, go buy/replay the first and get convinced, then buy this!\n\n\nUPDATE:\nI have finished the game.  Holy ♥♥♥♥ is it fun.  The systems have been improved upon greatly and the new race is a blast.  Rebalances have made the game a bit more fair, and the new level cap means your old characters are not obsolete.  New enemies (and some old ones) reappearing prevent combat from becoming boring or unsettling.\n\nNow for a sad thing.  I have encountered a bug (Thats ONE BUG in an entire game).  It does not affect gameplay significantly, but occasionally during combat characters will become invisible.  The outline below them remains, and the health indicators do not disappear, but the player model is invisible.  This applies to both heroes and enemies.\n\nHowever, since in 29 hours of gameplay I have only encountered a single bug in an otherwise masterful game, I am willing to forgive a small sin.\n\nAs others have said, this does lack a bit in story due to it being in the middle of a trilogy.  However, this entire game beautifully rises in dramatic action, with perpetually escalating conflict and a permanent sense of impending doom that really ties it all together.\n\nUpdating score to 9.4/10.","April 19","true","37.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

It has everything I might look for in a videogame: beautiful artstyle, wonderful soundtrack, compelling plot and - most importantly - incredibly well balanced and innovative game mechanics. A turn-based RPG that is truly one of its kind.\n\nThe second installment has stayed true to its predecessor, with a few fresh changes. The only addition I personally disliked was that more weight was given to chance, as the player now has to rely more heavily on crits and the like (one of the main character for instance always hits a random target among those who surround him). This makes the Banner Saga 2 a bit less of the chess-like game its prequel was, but definitely doesn't hinder it from shining.","April 30","true","31.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Just like it's predecessor, it is one of the few games I have ever played where I have a deep emotional connection to practically every playable character.  The atmosphere is rich, the decisions that you are faced with have meaning and dire purpose, and it is all housed in an interface that allows you to be absorbed in the grand tale itself without distraction.  I love the minimalist nature of the writing in the sense that so much is conveyed in every sentence that it leaves you fleshing out minor details as if you were reading a good fantasy novel.  All the while, a lush soundscape exists at a level that adds to the atmosphere, but never distracts from it.\n\nIf you enjoy tactical strategy games, this is a must to own.","April 19","true","6.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Beautiful artwork and music, huge improvement over the prequel.\n\n-----Review-----\n\nAdmittedly, I love tactical RPGs. Shining Force, FFTactics and X-Com (old and new) are amongst my favorite games. So, this genre is important to me. I want to voice this disclaimer before continuing.\n\nEver wonder what happened to beautiful artwork and awesome gameplay? That's one good reason to like games: Don Bluth style animation and immersive experiences. This is hard to find in the 21st century with all the CG/3D modeling out there. Although 3D games have truly grew into great experiences in their own right, nothing will replace beautiful 2D illustrations with vivid, scintillating colors. Pair it with awesome core gameplay, and you remember the reason you're gaming in the first place: this title delivers on both of these fronts.\n\nThe combat system, which is the meat of the game, is original and strategic. The depth with a simple system that is offered from The Banner Saga is staggering; there are only two main stats, armor and health. Armor protects you from damage, and health is obviously how much HP you can sustain before falling in battle. However, as a twist, health also determines how much damage you do: damage is calculated in The Banner Saga by [Enemy Armor] - [Attacker's Health]. This is the tip of the iceberg for this straightforward, yet complex gaming system. If you like turn-based games or tactical RPGs, the game mechanics alone are worth buying this game for.\n\nBanner Saga's story is truly engaging as well. While some gameplay elements have been sacrificed from the first Banner Saga (mainly out-of-combat scenarios and game mechanics), it is for the better as the game now has a greater streamlined feel from start to end. Decisions you make will determine whether your main characters, or your clansmen, will live or die. Although some of the main story arcs ultimately conclude to the same outcome in either case, it's still satisfying to think about and scrutinize your decisions during gameplay, as the consequences are great enough to have an impact on your experience.\n\nAside from story, the animation and music is excellent as well. This only makes The Banner Saga 2 an even stronger Ensemble in conjunction with it's core components: it's great to see good games like this still exist in 2016.\n\nFinally, compared to The Banner Saga 1, this game is overall an improvement. The Banner Saga 2 has a story which does a better job of retaining your interest, is it more polished than it's precursor, and the battles are far more enjoyable as well; The Banner Saga 1 at times had some insipid, tedious battle encounters. Moreover, The Banner Saga 1 also had skewed difficulty within some of their encounters at times, probably to emphasize the hopelessness and brutality of the story. Unfortunately, as a consequence, it created an unenjoyable experience during some portions of its original campaign.\n\nIn conclusion, The Banner Saga 2 is rated flat at 9/10. This is a really good game. It is somewhat short, but the depth of this game along with it's price tag easily overcomes this downside. The story branches just enough where replaying the campaign is a possibility as well, whereas The Banner Saga 1 did not have that quality of interest for me.","May 21","true","26.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is the epic and intriguing story, the dramatic and thought through setting, the deep and uncommon characters, outlined with the oustandingly beautiful art along with amazing music - all of that make this game shine. And trust me, you will appreciate how the plot unveals itself much more, if you played the first one.\n\nAfter all, this is only a chapter between the beginning and the end of a greater story.\n\nAnd if you've already learnt how the story starts, than this is the game you've been waiting.

It consists of story driven strategy gameplay with tactical turn-based battles. Don't expect frantic action requiring lightning reflexes, in Banner Saga you take your time with your decisions, as their consequences may prove heavy. While playing the first game isn't strictly necessary, I strongly recommend it, it will greatly improve your experience.\n\nSecond Banner Saga improves on what was already great in the first one. It offers new characters, new classes with new abilities, couple of new enemies, new victory conditions, training missions with objectives for bonus renown, improved caravan management, more animated cutscenes, insanely gorgeous art, great music, apocalyptic story reminiscent of Tolkien's works (complete with the strife and hardship). Plus you can import your save from the first Banner Saga with all consquences of your actions (hero roster, items, clansmen, supplies, renown) which may ultimately affect some of your decisions in BS2. Having the ability to play as either Rook or Alette gives you additional replay value, since dialogue options vary depending on who are you playing as (the main story however remains the same). Easily the best game I've played this year so far.\n\nIf I were to point out some negatives, there would be minor issues like the battle screen occasionally being a bit disorienting - they've introduced destructible obstacles with their own strength bars, so if you like to have strength/armor bars visible at all times like I do, the screen is cramped and it's harder to click the correct tile.\nAnd perhaps the pacing could have been improved as the final battle feels only as a warm up for the big finale we can expect in the third Saga. Ending with a cliffhanger with final part approx. two years away can be considered criminal :)\n\nAnyway, go buy it, it's great !","May 5","true","46.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really loved the first banner Saga so I hopped right on for the sequel. The second Act disappointed me though because the story really failed to grab me. and it feels like they skipped parts of the narratives that were really important. Another thing I felt personally they hopped around way too much to different groups perspectives making it hard to really get into any one faction's story. just when I was starting to get into X's dilemma they would hop over to Y and take me out of it. even worse than this though is that while we're hopped over to another group they skip what X was doing completely and then just pop us in later having missed everything up to that point. during a certain scene I literally stopped it and reloaded just because I thought I had missed an important introductory cutscene. nope they just left whole portions of the narrative of how Y got there and your just left making assumptions about the situation. I would say that is an objective problem with the story telling. a personal taste criticism I have of the story is they really have hit me with darkness induced apathy around the end of this installment. Our hero from the first game seems to have very little to fight for anymore rather than just Momentum and nobody else able to step up to lead(aside from obvious moustache twirling villains of course). And things get so bad all the characters really need a win. also there is another problem in that it seems the people who can actually fix things are actually secret evil jerks or turn suddenly stupidly villainous for drama's sake(this could partly be blamed on them cutting away from stuff and then suddenly coming back). then the story just ends abruptly with very little closure on this installment of anything. tried to be non spoilerly about this but final verdict I would only buy this if you love the sweet salty taste of your characters tears.","June 2","false","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It picks up right where the previous game ended, with your caravan of Viking style warriors and civilians desperately trying to escape the constant attacks of the Dredge.\n\nI thought the first game was good, but not great, however this sequel has significantly improved on some of BS1's flaws, and as a result I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of Banner Saga 2.\n\nThe Good Stuff\n\n•	Turn based combat system functions the same as before, but now has more depth and variety. Higher level heroes have access to more special abilities. One of your heroes, and a new type of Dredge, can turn invisible to set up a stealth attack. Another hero can summon an ally to help out. A new type of cavalry unit can retreat a few squares after making their attack. A couple of battles have special win conditions instead of just "kill everyone".\n•	The choices that you have to make along the journey are tough, and can sometimes have unexpected consequences. Its impossible to save everyone, but there were definitely some times when I think I made the wrong choice, which resulted in lots of people dying, and I felt pretty bad.\n•	The story is very well written. Its pretty intense and exciting for the whole game, and it ends in such a way that makes me very interested to see what happens in the next game.\n•	Music is excellent, sets the mood perfectly.\n•	Roughly 14 hours long, worth a full price purchase.\n•	Flawless technical performance.\n\nStuff that I would like to see improved in BS3\n\n•	Only a handful of key moments have voice acting. I want the whole game to be voiced - and keep the Scandinavian accents, because they're a perfect fit for the theme of the game.\n•	BS2 has a few animated cutscenes that allows the player see the action, rather than just reading about it. These cutscenes look amazing, so I want more of those.\n•	The player will encounter several traders along the journey, where they can buy items to equip on heroes and buff their stats in combat. But why can't we sell unwanted items?\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Banner Saga 2 is an excellent game, and it gets a really strong positive recommendation from me. If you enjoyed the first game, this is a must buy. If you never played BS1, I would advise playing that first, because if you start with BS2 you probably won't understand the story or who the characters are (there is a short recap, but its not really that useful).","June 2","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not joking. The story really got me into the game. I found myself on the edge of my seat plenty of times. The achievements aren't necessarily difficult, but they are a fun challenge. I put some real effort into keeping Egil alive, and it pays off; he returns in this game! The gameplay is fun, nothing too extraordinary when it comes to combat though. You have your pretty-average isometric, turn-based fighting game. Outside the fighting, it's like Oregon Trail, only vikings and bandits. I personally enjoy the characters. They're all pretty unique, and I find myself caring about them like I'm in the caravan with them. The music is really great ambience wise. I have yet to encounter any crashes, bugs, or lag. I'd say it's worth the price it's asking for, too. Overall an A+ game, but if you don't have the first one, you should play it to really get into it.\n\nEDIT: I've played a little more, and found that the tutorial is longer than it was in the first game.

The first game had a really good structure - the story was split in two, with you alternately leading a rag-tag band of refugees, or a rock hard army of giant monster killers. The characterisation was pretty good - the motivations were clear, and there was some belivable and interesting interaction between the characters in your groups. As the game went on, things got progressively worse, and since there was (at least for me) a serious danger of starving to death, I felt as if my decisions were pressured.\nThis time around - there are too many characters, and very few of them have anything to say or much to do with the story. I guess this is due to the problem of branching and the fact that, due to previous player decisions, many of these could have died - it must be difficult (or at least time consuming) to give these characters meaningful story lines - and the developers haven't. (Though a few of these disposable characters did pop up to say things like "I can't believe I'm not dead" and "Maybe I would be better off dead"... and then proceed to try and get themselves killed.)\nAgain, depending on the decisions made in the first game, one of your main characters may be a young girl/woman (not really clear how old she is) - it really strained credibility for me that she should be (seemingly) in charge of everything - in the first game there was a clear sense that leadership was given to the most experienced and trusted person - that seems to have gone out of the window this time around. The other main character is supposed to be a ruthless mad man, which I didn't really identify with. In general, the dialogue seemed a lot less interesting - the characters have been blandified (introduction of much faening swearing slightly jarring) apart from the completely mad characters, who are incomprehensible.\nIn the first game there was an element of mystery as to what was going on, but the basic motivations of the main characters were crystal clear. In this one, I just got more and more confused as the game went on - having seen the ending - I'm still none the wiser as to what was going on or what the point of half of the narrative was.\nSeveral deus ex machina devices used, and in contrast to the first game, the travel sections get easier and less pressurized as the game continues.\nAlso slightly annoying how many of the varl die in every battle - aren't these guys supposed to be rock solid?\n\nAnyway, sadly, I'm going to have to hang up my banner (or whatever) and give future installments of this series a miss. Bit sad, because I really enjoyed the first one!\n","April 23","false","7.6"," 27 of 54 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","27","54","0","0"

You finally get to the main city you've been marching towards all game and you're there for like 5 minutes  and then..it just ends. I expected to pan back to rook/alette in Aberrang after the "final boss" but you don't, it leaves you with a terrible cliffhanger ending. The horseborn also felt rushed, they show up at the very end of the game and aren't written very well at all. I would have also liked more dialogue from the Varl and humans in general but that fell short too\n\nGameplay: The battle gameplay is better with some new abilities and talents but the amount of fighters and varl in your caravan matters less than the first game, there's zero reason to train fighers, there's no big battle mechanic from the first so it does not matter\n\nOverall 7/10, could have been better if the final stretch of the game wasn't rushed. The developers should have kept it to a couple of good plot devices, not a bunch of weak ones with barely any explanation.

You essentially are just throwing in meat, hoping that the AI makes a mistake in who they take out first.  There is very little strategy.

The biggest impovement in my opinion is added element of the dynamic battlefield and how each of the battles feels more unique with new objectives requiring differing strategies.\n\nThe story telling does a great job of creating tension and keeps you on the edge of your seat like a great novel.\n\nThe artwork is beyond amazing, so gorgeous.  It is vibrant and colorful and feels world feels magical.\n\nI am honestly thinking about calling in sick tomorrow just to continue the story.  Probably won't sleep tonight and will want to play it again with a different save from the first banner saga.\n\nIf you liked the last one there is no reason not to pick this up.","April 19","true","14.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BMEhybrid/recommended/281640/","BMEhybrid","Archibald Von Hallström","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BMEhybrid/","133 products in account","There are very few games that urges me to buy both the game soundtrack or the Ipad portable versions of the game, "The Banner Saga" was one such game(among classics such as Heroes III). With that in mind my hype for the second part in a series of three games was massive. The return of characters that you really felt connected too and tried your best to save during the first game now team up with a whole new group of flavored characters and new races to survive the enemies hunting them from the first game.\n\nOverall the story and rich lore is delivered flawlessly as expected with a rather puzzeling cliffhanger at the end (yet again) and the few complains of the flavorless combat system from the first game have some what been fixed as the game raises the level cap of all heroes and provives you with new ways to really specialise each of the characters with higher crit chances or higher chance to dodge to name a few.\n\nThe voice acting and visual effects are still used to great effect just as they were in the first game but I tend to think that there are more voice acting in this game after complains about the lack of it in the first game(I guess not everyone enjoy the Visual Novel theme they were going for in their story telling). The game can easily be finished under the 20 hour mark but seeing as the price for the game have been lowered compared to the first one I find it more then acceptable, there is also the massive replay ability and the diffrent diffuculty levels just as in the first game and branching storylines to keep the player entertained for a good amount of time.","April 20","true","14.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The world is breaking (Ragnarok) and this is part of the mystery as the story unfolds.\nIn many aspects this sequel continues the trend of The Banner Saga 1. But on a grander scale. The enemies are more varied, the battles have more diverse environments and other winning objectives than simply "defeat all enemies".\n\nThe battles feel integral in moving the story along and it is paced very, very well in my view. The game's underlying mechanic is essentially getting from A to B via C via X. Confusing? Not really as the story branches out and introduces new main characters such as the war torn Varl (a race in this universe) Bolverk. A stark contrast (depending how you play and your choices of course) to the other main character.\n\nThe story, and choices, are multi-layered as you make decisions as to how (not) to protect your Caravan of people at the base level. The stakes are upped when you parley with more powerful individuals, whether in regards to magic, title or simply supernatural beings, and need to make decisions that can affect whole communities or possibly the world.\n\nIf you have played The Banner Saga 1, you will want more answers regarding the game's overarching plot of the world breaking apart. These are somewhat passed along to the player just like treats to a pet. They satisfy you for a bit but you stay to get more as The Banner Saga 2 augments the series' universe. The lines are blurred and your morality, as well as your view of people, will get challenged. Compared to other "choices matters" games it does matter here. Main characters can die, or be lost, 10 minutes after using all your ressources leveling them up.\n\nCommon sense will get you far in this game, but what exactly is common sense when you are presented with possible world altering consequences?","April 20","true","14.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maugister/recommended/281640/","maugister","maugister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maugister/","173 products in account","Banner Saga 1 was one of the most refreshing and intense experiences of the past few years. A good example of an small budget indie game that manages to transcend the limitations and expectations with good balance between simple ideas, good execution and minimalism that leave enough for the imagination to fulfil. There are few realistic big budget 3D games that manage to create as strong feelings as the 2D graphics that Banner Saga utilizes.\n\nBanner Saga 2 is a straight continuation from the moment where Banner Saga 1 ends and if you have played the first game and still have the same game available, you can import the save game and it's situation to the second episode and continue playing. Enginewise not much has changed - the game still consists of mainly three different elements:\n\n- tactical chesslike turn based battles\n- camping where you can decide how to divide renknown between your heroes (or save it for shopping as reknown is used both as experience and gold in this game, which makes for interesting choices and isn't as bad concept as it sounds).\n- storyline dialogues where you can choose between various options and see how it affects your situation, sometimes more or less drastically\n\nHowever, there are some major changes in relation to the first episode: the battles are less repetitive and tedious as most of the fights have some extra elements that make them more interesting. Sometimes something happens during the fight that changes the situation and makes it more interesting. There are possible extra elements in the battlefield that can be destroyed or utilized. There are also extra classes that give more choices to your party structure. Bard being one of the most interesting ones. His skill gives boost to one character and he replenishes nearby characters willpower if he's close enough to the place where an enemy is killed by singing a heroic song.\n\nAll in all Banner Saga 2 offers an updated and more enjoyable version of the already enjoyable first game with deep and emotional storyline that can contain rough and sad moments - like in real life, no matter how hard you try, sometimes bad things happen and you just have to cope instead of reload.\n\nIf you enjoy tactical battles, interesting characters and emotion inducing storylines in a viking fantasy world with sort of minimalistic and streamlined dialogue options, you can't go wrong with Banner Saga. But start with the first game.","April 20","true","6.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If u liked the first one u will like the second. I like the story is even more polished than the previous saga, U have higher levels on charakters and there are more abilities for each charakter. There are new charakters so it will keep u entertained. U can beat this game within 10-14 hrs on normal, what is a reasonable amount of time. After u finish u will want to play it again cause u have 2 main charakters from previous saga, with the same main quest, but they differ in some choises that u make along the main questline. This game is chalenging and ai is most times pretty polished. Some of ur actions will matter so u can lose many of ur playable charakters. There is not much that has been changed from the previous title story and charakters excluded. So if  expecting different gameplay dont look it in banner saga 2. If u want to continue the great story from banner saga this is ur game. If u didnt play banner saga 1 u can jump into this game with no problem. U may not understand some relationships and motivations that are in the first game, but recap that is in game will help u with main plot.","April 20","true","19.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The story picks up right where the first one left off and even gives you the option to load your save and choices from the other game, which is pretty cool. Overall a great game if you are looking for an amazing story, choose your own adventure style leadership, and casual turn based gameplay.

My playthrough was on Normal Difficulty.\n\nPros:\n* Art, music, atmosphere remain good.\n* Promotion/ranks are easier in this game\n* Strategy has improved; the approach to the training tent can net you Renown. Better special attack combos in general.\n* Your choices matter in this game. Be prepared to risk losing characters you love or for fights you feel conflicted about, especially late in the game.\n* Ludin seems...nicer. He was a character I didn't like in BS1, and he seems to have grown in BS2.\n* Reasonably good way of handling/discussing sexism for the setting.\n* I imported an old save; I could immediately tell my choices in BS1 mattered. I saved Egil in BS1 and Alette lived, and that actually gave me a special scene in BS2 at a certain godstone.\n\nCons:\n* Image flickering in Old Wood with Horseborn fight\n* Occasional lag\n* Don't expect to be playing from the perspective of a "hero" all the time. Bolverk is...different. He's probably the furthest thing from heroic, and oftentimes I found all of the options in conversation for him to be negative ones. He can be very rewarding, as his personal story is very rich, but in the beginning, he's incredibly frustrating, at least for me.\n* Ending feels a bit...abrupt, comparedto BS1. As if one is being stopped mid-tale. BS1 has a sense of closure to me; BS2 feels like I'm left on a cliffhanger. Could be a pro, depending on how you like your plot structured; it was just a bit jarring for me.","April 19","true","23.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

The only new feature are  these pointless annoying barricades, which only serve to make combat go longer as you spend 2-3 turns getting around the bloody things.  The story is much the same as before, you think you are making chocies along the way but you really aren't.\n\nAn example of the so called choice the game pretends to offer the player, one of your fighters wants to leave, you say no, he leaves anyway, if you say yes he leaves.  So whats the point of giving me the option to make a choice in the first place?  This is pretty much how the whole choice system goes in the game, give the player a few options, and they all lead to the same outcome.  Lazy game design.\n\nOne change i have noticed from the first game, is the clansmen, fighters and varl in your group matter less than they did before.  As there are no large battles anymore.  You can really just let them all die and not worry about finding food all the time, jsut use your renown to upgrade your key units.\n\nThe biggest issue with this game is the last battle, it doesn't matter if you win or loose the game ends exactly the same way.  So again what is the point of a game that pretends to give you choice and has already predeterminded the outcome.\n\nA few new units have been added to fight against.  Overall it is a bit flat in the content, the mechanics haven't been improved and the whole thing is a bit draining and the ending is a poor, lazy pile of crap.","April 20","false","10.4"," 69 of 143 people (48%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","48","69","143","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CloudBarrow/recommended/281640/","CloudBarrow","Leonardo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CloudBarrow/","56 products in account","I'm torn\nI really love this game. The artwork, soundtrack and gameplay are all on point. It's not the best game I've ever played, but it accomplishes what it attempts to do, and that is delivering a very well told story in a way that melds well with the gameplay and art style along with blending multiple game styles (RTS, RPG, and turn based management) in a way that is not only entertaining, but enriching.\nOften times, whenever I play video games, I go through the motions of killing, stealing, farming, and looting with no remorse for my victim or their families. Many video game companies and programmers claim that their video game is an "every decision matters" video game, but this one truly is. There haven't been very many video game characters that make me feel any kind of attachment of discontent towards them. EVERY character on this video game has. There are very few characters, throughout my 2 playthroughs of both games, that weren't memorable, in some fashion.\nWhat I'm getting at, is that as a standalone game, it's a masterpiece.\nHOWEVER\nI have a few fundamental problems with not only this series but also with the way that Stoic games is handling this series. I'll start with Stoic games since that statment might leave a few of you scratching your heads.\nI have ALWAYS had a problem paying 60 -100 bucks for a brand new game. It's the reason I play so many indie games. The content has to be in harmony with the price point. When I bought the first Banner Saga for (I think it was) $15, I was a bit skeptical. There were a lot of negative reviews saying that there wasn't $15 dollars worth of content in that game, and to an extent, I agree with them. (The replayability of these games is actually quite high, which is the only reason I don't fully agree) BUT at 15 bucks, it wasn't a bad buy. It had multiple great stories that culminated into an epic that jerked a tear from my eyes.\nFast forward 1 and a half(ish) years. The sequel comes out. Whenever you deliver the type of story that the Banner Saga attempts to deliver in the manner that they did it, you should NEVER make your audience wait that long for a sequel. EVER. I understand you have a small staff, but over the course of 2 years, I've given your company 40 bucks for 2 games. The content of these 2 games doesn't begin to add up to some of these AAA game titles out there. There WILL be a third banner saga. ASSUMING (which, I've learned, is a bad thing to do when dealing with Stoic) that the third game will end this series of games, I will have spent, roughly, 60 bucks on all of your video games. Assuming that the third one takes another three hours to complete, and I play every story-line available through all three games, (Banner Saga 1- 3 hours, Banner Saga 2 & 3- 6 hours each-3 hours for each story-line) I will have 15 hours of gameplay under my belt with nothing else that can be done in the game other beating the game on an alternate difficulty.\n\nSadly, this is the direction that indie games are going. Small companies start running out of money, so they cut their story short and leave you with a "next time on dragon ball z" sequence as the last impression of their video game. 16 months later, they do it all over again, except charge you 5 bucks more than the predecessor.\n\nI had a really, really hard time deciding whether to recommend this game or not. All in all, if you enjoy a game for the story and experience as I do, you'll want to experience this game. If you're looking for something to dive into for the next 2 weeks, you'll have to look elswhere. I finished this game on the same day that I installed it. I know I have posted a lot of problems I have with this game, but I will definitely be buying the third game. Not for the gameplay, and definitely not for Stoic Games, but for Alette and Rook.\nTL;DR\nGreat story. You'll fall in love with the main characters; fact.\nTerrible pricepoint for the content. Follows a terrible precedent set by a video game company that reminds me more of a mobile app developer than a legit indie video game developer.\n","May 3","false","83.7"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

Do you need to have played the first one? Yes I do believe so, you will seriously miss out on lore and back story for the characters if you don’t! Not to mention your choices from the first game are carried over.\n\nThis game has made some great improvements most notably for myself is the foraging system. In the first game you had to buy supplies with renown which was also required to level up, you had to balance on the fine line of ‘keeping your people alive?’ or ‘levelling up to win battles’ Now while you do still need to buy supplies your clansmen now go out and forage while on the path which is a massive help. There are also new a new species, new enemies and hazards in the battlefields now which makes the battles more interesting.\n\nThe story continues on from the last game and more is revealed and hinted at as to why the world is breaking. But the game is left on a massive cliff-hanger so gosh darn it I can’t wait for the third game! Please don’t let it be in two years…\nThe music is again beautiful and atmospheric, I made sure to purchase the special edition so I own the OST.

This game series or franchise with it's own unique lore captivated me in such a way that only 'The Song of Ice and Fire' has been able to do until now. I would recommend play the first Banner Saga since it just makes you more invested in the characters, their histories and the lore.\nNow what bad can I say about this second part? Nothing really comes to mind. The gameplay was more polished and more intense. More new characters giving the player more ways to experiment in the playground. The choices also seemed much more smooth but as impactful as the first one.\nThe Plot in this however trumps the first one by miles. It was so tight, informative and such a delight to be able to play a game with such intense and lore filled story that makes me so angry that I have to wait for like a year before the last part of the trilogy comes out, sad that this game will end soon and excited that I can see what will finally come to pass.\nRook, Iver, Bolverk, Attlete, Hakon, Gunnulf, Sigbjorn & Tryggvi are like my new favorite characters I look forward to about knowing how their life ends up after all this.\nAll in all, I am excited for the next installment in this series and hope this turns into a show like 'Game of Thrones' or an epic movie franchise like 'Lord of the Rings'. 10/10 is my rating.","April 21","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once again the gorgeous art style evokes a feeling of purity and beauty, yet in this second installment there is a clear feeling of loss and danger that comes with it. As you pass through the world, it gives one pangs of sorrow, because it's clear that the darkness is coming to destroy all that is lovely.\n\nTo begin, THE SOUNDTRACK ALONE IS WORTH THE MONEY! Austin Wintory (composer of Journey, flOw, Horn, The Banner Saga, and many more) does an exceptional job once again building the perfect rugged and fierce atmosphere for this mystical Nordic landscape. The music fits the brutality of war; blaring horns bombard the listener in fight sequences, and in the time between fights, the soundtrack helps keep tension high. Soulful performances by the vocal soloists tie everything together perfectly.\n\nThis product is more of a story than a videogame, and you truly feel like your decisions have weight. The storyline is great-- major props to the writers for creating such a well crafted experience. There is no right decision at any fork in the road, and many times along the journey you will regret your choices. It is virtually impossible to finish this game without questioning some moves you had to make, but that is part of the beauty.\nThe combat system is not too challenging, but at times thinking on your feet and making sacrifices is going to be required. You are challenged to take on the personality of your character and do not only what you want to do, but also what your character is able do while keeping a good reputation. There are consequences for being too ruthless, but also for being overly-soft or lenient. You have to strike a balance.\n\nIn my opinion, the most important thing to keep in mind while playing this game is that it is just ONE part of a MULTIPLE part series, and should be treated as such! Do not go in expecting closure at the end, or even a perfect story-arch. What you get is part of an incredible journey, one that isnt too common in games. I STRONGLY recommend this game, the previous game, and any future games in this series.\nOn their own, each game may not be a feature-length experience and game, but when put together, you get a 30+ hour adventure that is unforgettable. I can't wait for The Banner Saga 3!","April 24","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

More races and unit classes to be met. Even more future decisions to be made.\nRemoved: War planning, very punishing gameplay.\nStory-5/5\nGameplay-4.5/5\nPacing-3.5/5\nGraphics-5/5 (Can't add more sadly for this beautifuly drawn out figures and backgrounds)\nPros- The game is worked on by very dedicated people, meaning you'll feel all of their time taken to write out the story and draw out individual scenes throughout the game. Without spoiling too much the story they have based off of Norse mythology is most likely leading up to a 3rd game in the near future and I can't wait. The gameplay was improved upon making abilities more intuitive upon interaction compared to last banner saga.\nCons- Their pacing is quite a bit varied amongst the game once going throughout the story of both, the first one was very quick and desperation due to rise of a huge threat, and this one is basically a huge slow slide down meaning it's mainly easy to get to the end of the game. Also compared to the last game, you aren't really punished for bad decisions in this game compared to last game making the game that much easier. Also once you find a certain strategy it's hard to beat, especially with certain units able to abuse AI or able to just one shot almost any unit. My main complaint is the AI aren't the smartest beings but that doesn't make the game unplayable, just a bit easier to cheese.","April 24","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also some interesting new characters.\nA lot of the stuff about the first one that I liked are still there - such as a really surprisingly enjoyable combat system.\n\nHOWEVER:\nThe story felt very hollow compared to the first one. In the first game I found myself very deeply invested in a lot of the characters and their motivations, but in this one it felt like the devs hadn't really bothered to tell the stories of the characters further, it just felt very half ♥♥♥♥♥ in that respect. Also, a lot of the heroes just felt so pointless. There's too many of them, some of them never say anything and you end up never using most of them for fights because you don't level them up. Although the story did split in two directions, I felt like it could have done with having more storylines to allow a longer game with more diversity, and paying more attention to more heroes.\nAlso, a lot of the time, especially towards the end, I was very confused, and the final battle and actual end was so unsatisfying, confusing, and left too much up in the air. If the devs delay release of the next one as long as they did this one, I'll have the same problem as I did this time of being totally unable to remember 80% of what happened, and being even more confused!\nAnd also, having fighters in the caravan felt pointless as there were no big battles like in the first one.\n\nOVERALL\nDespite all my complaining, it is still a great game, and the issues, particularly with the story, only come because I'm comparing them to an amazing first game and its really captivating story. So, although slightly disappointing after the original, I still had a lot of fun playing this game and will definitely stick with the series.","April 25","true","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The saga continues. The Banner Saga 2 allows players to import the save file from the original game. All the great items you earned, experience you received from killing dredges, and good/bad decisions you made from the first game WILL impact the outcome of this amazing sequel. If some characters are killed off in the original game, they won't return for the sequel.\nThe new leveling system has evolved from the original game. Each character's level cap is increased to 10. Incremental renown requirement for each levelup is lowered from 5 to 2 points in this new game. Feel free to try out different fighters from the rooster because multiple members can be maxed out by chapter 15. Many players have ignored leveling up some characters from the original game for various reasons. These characters will start off as level 3 fighters from the beginning of the sequel, so they are still helpful during combat.\nThe introduction of many new classes have opened up many more possibilities during combat. The poet class can replenish the entire party's will power, the agile horsebreed race can use the hit-and-run tactics, and the berserker class can attack twice during each turn...\nThe introduction of secondary skills and traits allocation have made the combat more engaging, tactical and fun. Versatile fighters can be created by spending extra skill points to specific traits. All characters are relatively balanced. High armor characters might shine in the normal mode, but others' nifty skills might turn the tide of the battle in hard difficulty. Some impressive skills include beast summoning, invisibility, axe throwing, and overwatch. New ranged and buffing enemies have made the game more challenging.\nStorywise, The Banner Saga 2 suggests there are two sides of the same story. For the first time, players can experience the saga from 2 distinct perspectives: the benevolent rook/alette or the impulsive Bolverk. Betrayal is certainly the reoccuring theme of this fantastic sequel. Sefa the starving archer, the risk-averting king, and the oppressed Canary are not necessarily 100% evil per se. Players can resonate with their perfectly reasonable motivations.  New revelations suggest that dredges are not all evil. Juno can be viewed as a heroic valka or a manipulative instigator. The sequel ends with a major cliffhanger, and player's last decision is not only difficult but also heartbreaking.\nIf you love great storytelling, character development and tactical combat, the Banner Saga 2 will not disappoint!","April 25","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So needless to say, I used all my spare time and couldn't stop playing until I had rushed through it in a mere two days. This is my only real criticism of the game: it *seems* a bit shorter than the first one, but this might also come from being used to the basic game mechanics due to playing the first part over and over.\nNevertheless, I can easily say this game contains some of the greatest content you can get for 20 bucks and I really can't wait until the next installment comes out.","April 23","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story remains interesting and starts with a bigger cast of characters. There's more situations to lose them as well, which really adds to the tension. The character customization is significantly expanded and there's more interested items to equid. This helps make the already solid combat even more interesting.\n\nThe balance of the cost of items and levels are far better, making buying an item from the market actually a potentially good idea. The battles also are far more dynamic and interestly designed, there's a variety of gimmicks, rather than two groups fighting until everyone is dead every time.\n\nOther mechanics were also improved to make them matter more, like how wounds persist until you rest. Also, the two main characters are actually very different, unlike Rook and Hakon, who felt both like decent people. This time you have one good protagonist and one very selfish one.\n\nThe music and graphics are as good as ever, not much to say other than they're still excellent.\n\nThere are a few problems, however. The war mechanic, which had issues in the first game, is almost totally gone, making fighters kinda pointless. Also, some choices from the first game I was excited to see fuflilled didn't get an closure. I ran into one bug twice where the character models would disapear. I could still play, but it was annoying to do so and immersion breaking. Finally, I wasn't a huge fan of the ending. Like this first it is quite abrupt and the story clearly needs a Banner Saga 3, but unlike the first I feel like there's so much more left unresolved.\n\nOverall, it's an excellent game and I'm very happy with it. It's a little short as I finished it in about 7 hours, but it's easily worth two playthroughs. If you played the first this is totally worth picking up. Otherwise, you should really get the first game and play that, because the story is compelling.","May 2","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have over 80 hours logged on it, gotten every achievement and beaten it at least 5 times. I actually just did a fresh playthrough of TBS1 and I still loved it!\n\nThe Banner Saga 2 is a DIRECT continuation of the first one. The first thing I noticed when I gained control is I had the exact same resources, clansman, fighters and varl as my imported save. My characters retained the same level and equipment, however it seems like they boosted all your underleveled characters up to level 3.\nI actually didn't expect this and it took me by surprise. Then again, I wasn't sure what to expect.\n\nEverything you liked or disliked about the first Banner Saga is back except everything is a -little- nicer and freshened up a bit!\nMy only real complaint is about the progression system. Now, all your units can level up to level 10 but the problem is, there's no real reason to. The stat caps on your units hasn't increased at all but instead you have two options per maxed stat that can be put into a related perk. The problem is, they are all minute RNG based stats. Chance to avoid damage, critical hit chance, dodge chance, chance to avoid death are a few of the options you are given.\nNot only this but all of the new equipment seems to follow this design, as well, such as giving you higher tier of these random chances or more other tertiary stats that I couldn't be bothered with.\n\nIt's no secret that The Banner Saga's combat is just a math battle so giving you more and bigger flat stats on levels and gear might be tough to balance and heavily dependant on how you did in The Banner Saga 1. However, by the end of this instalment, I was swimming in renown and couldn't be bothered to feed it to my units to min-max more. I think the highest level I got a character was maybe 7 and I still did fine.\n\nOverall, I'm sad to say that I doubt I'll be finding the same replay value that I did with the first Banner Saga. The ending to this instalment came more sudden and cliffhanger-ey than the last, to the point where it sapped any real urge I had to start another playthrough, anytime soon.\nStill, I am eager to see the end of this amazing series!\nHere's to hoping we don't have to wait another two years for the last part of the trilogy!","April 26","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game should have been atleast twice the length (I got maybe 10 hours at best) given the $20 price, and the expectations set by the first (I got about 20-25 on the first). In terms of story, impressive and intriguing, although not expanded enough on for this to be considered a full/single "game"\n\nGameplay has nothing signifigant or new. The horseborn race is at best a new class to work with, and at worst irrelivant depending on your playstyle. This being said, anybody who enjoyed the first game will enjoy the maps on this game. There were some new battlefield objectives besides "kill everyone", which was nice. Classes saw more abilities and more dynamic use of skills.\n\nDecisions in this game felt much less important overall, and really didn't matter. In a blind playthrough, I lost no units to storyline (in the first game, I lost many as a result of poor decisions). The forage ability of clansman also made managing supplies more or less irrelivant.\n\nMy biggest let down of this game was the lack of intimidation I felt from the dredge. The first game made me feel threatened by the mass of black, unknown creatures more than any other game or enemy (think a zombie game but more intense). The constant threat and scariness just wasn't there.\n\nOverall, it takes on the first game and builds on some aspects, but overall I wouldn't call this "Banner Saga 2" so much as "Banner Saga 1.5". It left me wanting more especially in terms of story, but has a lot of potential to buildup to an epic ending in Banner Saga 3, if tied togother properly.\n\n(if you really enjoyed the first game, this is a good buy. If you we're 50/50 on the first game, watching a youtube series much just be better)","April 22","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Banner Saga however was an exception for me. I remember years ago when I still carried my Gameboy Advance SP around with me and one of my favourite games was Final Fantasy Tactics. I loved the fantasy genre and I loved RPGs so it was no surprise that I loved the game. Over the years, I’d been searching for a game that could live up to the standard of Final Fantasy Tactics. And one fine day when I decided to google, I came across the Banner Saga. I was hooked and played hours on end until I completed the game. Despite the flaws that many reviewers pointed out (and which I agree with), I completely overlooked them and thoroughly enjoyed the game. While the game’s strength was in its story, the combat (and levelling) was still good enough for me. The story ended on a rather tragic note but it was well-written nonetheless; someone must sacrifice themselves to save many others.\n\nI’d been waiting so long for the sequel that the moment it was released for pre-order, I snapped it up. Not because of the price though (what kind of offer is $2 off anyway?). And I finished it within 2 days (14 hours). While there were many new features, I couldn’t help but feel that the developers were really just taking the first game and slotting in bits and pieces here and there. It felt like taking Banner Saga and aside from the continuation of the story, you were just getting some extra DLC. I didn’t get the first game at full price so I didn’t feel the pinch but now I’m hesitant to get Banner Saga 3 at full price when it comes out. Below is a breakdown of my experience:\n\nOverall experience: 7.5/10\nCaravan management: 3/10\nYou spent probably 50% of your time watching your caravan travel from one point to the other. I guess the devs felt they should make use of this time to engage the player. Besides occasionally feeding your caravan (btw I spent close to nothing buying supplies), you could train your clansmen to become fighters. I didn’t really see the point of doing that and only did it once or twice throughout the whole game. I only remember a couple of moments where the number of fighters came into play and never once did I think: “Damn I should have trained more of them earlier!” More fighters simply means higher consumption of supplies and fewer people to forage (which is a neat feature). In other words, the devs kinda failed at making caravan management a crucial part of the game.\n\nTraining (in camp): 5/10\nThis was a nice addition to the game. Instead of figuring stuff out through countless battles, you could learn new strategies based on objectives given in this. I thought there was more potential for this part though. I found myself just completing the objectives for the sake of renown. And I got stuck during the training on Bolverk’s side… what makes it worse is that there are no freaking hints so I just gave up.\n\nCombat: 7/10\nPerhaps the most important part of the game since this is where you actually do stuff.\nBarricades: kinda lame and I didn’t see any point in wasting supplies for it. I only encountered them twice (first and one of the last battles).\nNew enemies entering the battlefield: interesting at first but got annoying later. At least I can get more kills to level up and extra renown.\nNew heroes: definitely a crucial addition to the game that I enjoyed. While my first playthrough used many of the old heroes that I’m familiar with, I am definitely going to try out different strategies during my second playthrough. Bolverk is insane though; it was really fun going on a killing spree using him.\nSecond skill and traits: good addition to the game. Gives you more reason to level up certain characters as well as make them more versatile.\nImprovements that could be made: I’m quite surprised the devs haven’t figured some of the improvements to make. E.g Flanking damage bonus + direction facing, more terrain types (slowing/damaging/block range attacks/damage or range bonus from higher ground/traps such as minefields)\n\nStory: 8/10\nSome really tough decisions to make throughout the game which is a good thing. Story is still pretty much linear but that’s not all bad because I enjoyed the story. So many unexpected twists where the good guys turn out to POSSIBLY(?!)[\i] be the bad guys.\n\nWhat keeps me from giving a 10 though is the ending of the story. Unlike the first game, the story ended off on a cliff-hanger; it was like suspense for the sake of getting people to buy the next game and I just felt so cheated because there was no conclusion after so many hours. I thought a certain reptile died way too quickly and it was sad to not be able to fight it. The final battle was way too easy and disappointing too. That said, I will still play the last game for the story (to get closure you know). Hoping the devs will make the game even better.","April 22","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game series or franchise with it's own unique lore captivated me in such a way that only 'The Song of Ice and Fire' has been able to do until now. I would recommend play the first Banner Saga since it just makes you more invested in the characters, their histories and the lore.\nNow what bad can I say about this second part? Nothing really comes to mind. The gameplay was more polished and more intense. More new characters giving the player more ways to experiment in the playground. The choices also seemed much more smooth but as impactful as the first one.\nThe Plot in this however trumps the first one by miles. It was so tight, informative and such a delight to be able to play a game with such intense and lore filled story that makes me so angry that I have to wait for like a year before the last part of the trilogy comes out, sad that this game will end soon and excited that I can see what will finally come to pass.\nRook, Iver, Bolverk, Attlete, Hakon, Gunnulf, Sigbjorn & Tryggvi are like my new favorite characters I look forward to about knowing how their life ends up after all this.\nAll in all, I am excited for the next installment in this series and hope this turns into a show like 'Game of Thrones' or an epic movie franchise like 'Lord of the Rings'. 10/10 is my rating.","April 21","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The release date was pushed back, much to my dismay - It was supposed to come out much, much earlier, but the delay wasn't so major as to shake me from wanting to play.\n\nI'll a list, in brief, of how the game improved or held the standard of quality, and where it fell short:\n+ The art was the same style I had grown to love, with many more animated short cutscenes to help flavor moments.\n+ A much wider range of enemy types over the game made for generally more interesting combat scenarios.\n+ Some of the fights were very hard for reasons other than "There are a lot of very hard hitting things"\n+ The writing masterfully captures certain emotions and states of being.\n+ The soundtrack is even better than the first - Austin Wintory proves himself again to be perfect for the series\n+ The change in tone between the two parties was very well-executed and it felt as though you were playing two sides of a story, as opposed to two split sections of the same party\n- A handful of new characters introduced were by and large irrelevant to the story and a strange attempt to give more variety to party composition\n- There are still quite a few flaws in how the combat controls (Especially with movement pathing making the last fight more of a chore than a climactic showdown)\n- The story, while fantastic, still lacks a lot of choice, and things will always end up the same (Sans the presence of a few supporting characters)\n\nAll in all, it was a great experience. I cannot stress enough how well emotions were written into this. Certain characters were also perfect in how you felt for them, about them, or with them - Rugga, Bolverk, and Egil all come to mind as examples. Amusingly enough, Egil is alive by default if you do not load an older game. Glad to have him.","April 22","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are looking for a game in the vein of the Infinity Engine classics, or even other "strategy RPGs", I don't know that this scratch that itch.  it is however, a good game with a a very good story.\n\nLike the first game, you will be placed in the persons of multiple leaders of small (to large) groups of refugees, warriors, and the giant varls.  Also like the first game, this is not an open world  game and you follow mostly pre-determined paths.  You inject a bit of your own personality during decision making dialog sequences and special events.  Decisions made in the first game affect the experience of the this entry. The decisions throughout the series have had major consequences by the end of the game.\n\nI have beaten the game already, which is reare for me these days with a packed work schedule.  The last time I binged on a game like this was The Witcher 3.  Totally different games, but the story kept me hooked and I wanted to see what happened.\n\nI could go on for a while, but I want to wrap up with this:  I have already said the game is not like the Inifinity Engine games, and certainly not like The Witcher.  So what does this game remember me of?  Oregon Tail, but with magic.  And combat.","April 22","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game should have been atleast twice the length (I got maybe 10 hours at best) given the $20 price, and the expectations set by the first (I got about 20-25 on the first). In terms of story, impressive and intriguing, although not expanded enough on for this to be considered a full/single "game"\n\nGameplay has nothing signifigant or new. The horseborn race is at best a new class to work with, and at worst irrelivant depending on your playstyle. This being said, anybody who enjoyed the first game will enjoy the maps on this game. There were some new battlefield objectives besides "kill everyone", which was nice. Classes saw more abilities and more dynamic use of skills.\n\nDecisions in this game felt much less important overall, and really didn't matter. In a blind playthrough, I lost no units to storyline (in the first game, I lost many as a result of poor decisions). The forage ability of clansman also made managing supplies more or less irrelivant.\n\nMy biggest let down of this game was the lack of intimidation I felt from the dredge. The first game made me feel threatened by the mass of black, unknown creatures more than any other game or enemy (think a zombie game but more intense). The constant threat and scariness just wasn't there.\n\nOverall, it takes on the first game and builds on some aspects, but overall I wouldn't call this "Banner Saga 2" so much as "Banner Saga 1.5". It left me wanting more especially in terms of story, but has a lot of potential to buildup to an epic ending in Banner Saga 3, if tied togother properly.\n\n(if you really enjoyed the first game, this is a good buy. If you we're 50/50 on the first game, watching a youtube series much just be better)","April 22","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Choices you made from the very beginning **Hint Hint**Better have kept Eirik, you can get a ****ing bear with him! **Hint Hint** come to impact you in different stages throughout this game and it's very satisfying when you feel you made the right one as a result. Difficulty is well done as you can choose a great many times whether or not to fight someone and this is nice because you can always do it to train and possibly get more items or people but if you can't be bothered or are hurtin then it's not overly punishing as their are many opportunities to fight and train throughout.\nTheir is a renown reward for fist time achievements such as 5 kills with any specific class and this is very helpful for first time playthroughs, it gives you a compensary edge for learning mistakes, but makes it a real breeze if you played the first game a fair bit.\nWith the caravan now whenever you join people they will either be a fighter, clansman or varl. Your charcters are also always included in the counters for one of these 3. It's a nice idea and I really liked it, the idea is to find a nice ratio of balancing fighters with clansman and grabbing every single varl under the never setting sun that you can. The fighters and varl protect the clansman whenever you fight and the clansman will forage for supplies periodically and consume less supplies then the fighters. That's about the end of it, there are certain checks and events that tend to occur depending on how many you have of fighters/clansman and their ratio. An example being fighters on boats, this is a bad idea, don't do it.\nAll in all it's a wonderful game i'd say, with great replayability I just beat it with my first continuation playthrough with Rook and have gotten half way through with my second as Alette.","April 24","true","33.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game should have been atleast twice the length (I got maybe 10 hours at best) given the $20 price, and the expectations set by the first (I got about 20-25 on the first). In terms of story, impressive and intriguing, although not expanded enough on for this to be considered a full/single "game"\n\nGameplay has nothing signifigant or new. The horseborn race is at best a new class to work with, and at worst irrelivant depending on your playstyle. This being said, anybody who enjoyed the first game will enjoy the maps on this game. There were some new battlefield objectives besides "kill everyone", which was nice. Classes saw more abilities and more dynamic use of skills.\n\nDecisions in this game felt much less important overall, and really didn't matter. In a blind playthrough, I lost no units to storyline (in the first game, I lost many as a result of poor decisions). The forage ability of clansman also made managing supplies more or less irrelivant.\n\nMy biggest let down of this game was the lack of intimidation I felt from the dredge. The first game made me feel threatened by the mass of black, unknown creatures more than any other game or enemy (think a zombie game but more intense). The constant threat and scariness just wasn't there.\n\nOverall, it takes on the first game and builds on some aspects, but overall I wouldn't call this "Banner Saga 2" so much as "Banner Saga 1.5". It left me wanting more especially in terms of story, but has a lot of potential to buildup to an epic ending in Banner Saga 3, if tied togother properly.\n\n(if you really enjoyed the first game, this is a good buy. If you we're 50/50 on the first game, watching a youtube series much just be better)","April 22","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Banner Saga however was an exception for me. I remember years ago when I still carried my Gameboy Advance SP around with me and one of my favourite games was Final Fantasy Tactics. I loved the fantasy genre and I loved RPGs so it was no surprise that I loved the game. Over the years, I’d been searching for a game that could live up to the standard of Final Fantasy Tactics. And one fine day when I decided to google, I came across the Banner Saga. I was hooked and played hours on end until I completed the game. Despite the flaws that many reviewers pointed out (and which I agree with), I completely overlooked them and thoroughly enjoyed the game. While the game’s strength was in its story, the combat (and levelling) was still good enough for me. The story ended on a rather tragic note but it was well-written nonetheless; someone must sacrifice themselves to save many others.\n\nI’d been waiting so long for the sequel that the moment it was released for pre-order, I snapped it up. Not because of the price though (what kind of offer is $2 off anyway?). And I finished it within 2 days (14 hours). While there were many new features, I couldn’t help but feel that the developers were really just taking the first game and slotting in bits and pieces here and there. It felt like taking Banner Saga and aside from the continuation of the story, you were just getting some extra DLC. I didn’t get the first game at full price so I didn’t feel the pinch but now I’m hesitant to get Banner Saga 3 at full price when it comes out. Below is a breakdown of my experience:\n\nOverall experience: 7.5/10\nCaravan management: 3/10\nYou spent probably 50% of your time watching your caravan travel from one point to the other. I guess the devs felt they should make use of this time to engage the player. Besides occasionally feeding your caravan (btw I spent close to nothing buying supplies), you could train your clansmen to become fighters. I didn’t really see the point of doing that and only did it once or twice throughout the whole game. I only remember a couple of moments where the number of fighters came into play and never once did I think: “Damn I should have trained more of them earlier!” More fighters simply means higher consumption of supplies and fewer people to forage (which is a neat feature). In other words, the devs kinda failed at making caravan management a crucial part of the game.\n\nTraining (in camp): 5/10\nThis was a nice addition to the game. Instead of figuring stuff out through countless battles, you could learn new strategies based on objectives given in this. I thought there was more potential for this part though. I found myself just completing the objectives for the sake of renown. And I got stuck during the training on Bolverk’s side… what makes it worse is that there are no freaking hints so I just gave up.\n\nCombat: 7/10\nPerhaps the most important part of the game since this is where you actually do stuff.\nBarricades: kinda lame and I didn’t see any point in wasting supplies for it. I only encountered them twice (first and one of the last battles).\nNew enemies entering the battlefield: interesting at first but got annoying later. At least I can get more kills to level up and extra renown.\nNew heroes: definitely a crucial addition to the game that I enjoyed. While my first playthrough used many of the old heroes that I’m familiar with, I am definitely going to try out different strategies during my second playthrough. Bolverk is insane though; it was really fun going on a killing spree using him.\nSecond skill and traits: good addition to the game. Gives you more reason to level up certain characters as well as make them more versatile.\nImprovements that could be made: I’m quite surprised the devs haven’t figured some of the improvements to make. E.g Flanking damage bonus + direction facing, more terrain types (slowing/damaging/block range attacks/damage or range bonus from higher ground/traps such as minefields)\n\nStory: 8/10\nSome really tough decisions to make throughout the game which is a good thing. Story is still pretty much linear but that’s not all bad because I enjoyed the story. So many unexpected twists where the good guys turn out to POSSIBLY(?!)[\i] be the bad guys.\n\nWhat keeps me from giving a 10 though is the ending of the story. Unlike the first game, the story ended off on a cliff-hanger; it was like suspense for the sake of getting people to buy the next game and I just felt so cheated because there was no conclusion after so many hours. I thought a certain reptile died way too quickly and it was sad to not be able to fight it. The final battle was way too easy and disappointing too. That said, I will still play the last game for the story (to get closure you know). Hoping the devs will make the game even better.","April 22","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If morale is high or low, it effects your tactical battles by giving you some positive or negative boosters to combat.  There are even decisions that you have to make during your travels that will effect this as well.\n\nThe tactical gameplay is pretty tough at first.

Long awaited by myself an I imagined it would be similiar to the first Banner Sage.\nBut it isn't... It is WAY better which is still unthinkable for me. All the great artistic landscapes and charaters show how much love is put into the game.\n\nOne of my biggest concerns in the Banner Saga 1 was, that you only play lik 6-7 heroes and all the other interesting characters are avoided since they are outleveled. With a clever trick the game "forces" you to play a great diversity of characters which makes fight MUCH more interesting than before. You have to look for new tactics and keep balance between the characters. Nontheless you can push a few characters very high.\n\nThe atmospheric soundtrack brings chills down my spine and I get goosebumps from time to time. Sometimes the pictures and howling winds tell more than 1000 words.\n\nThe Banner Saga ist one of the best games I have ever played. Developers you can be very, ery proud of yourself!\n\nNontheless I have 2 small concerns:\n\n1) Walking in fights is sometimes a pain in the .... The hitbox of the confirmation button is so small that very often another tile is selected and I have to reselect the original tile. It takes the flow out of the fights.\n\n2) A voice acting would be evry nice but I can fully understand that implementing that means a lot more efford.\n\nSo all in all: Buy this game! Play the prequel first and you will have a great and epic time!","April 28","true","20.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its sequel continues to excel in all of those aspects, while also improving on the overall gameplay experience. If there was one issue I had with The Banner Saga, it was a lack of variety. Environments, while gorgeous, consisted almost entirely of foreboding snowy landscapes. Now there are otherworldly neon caves and colorful, perfume-laced woods, amongst others. A new race of characters rounds out the addition of new factions, new classes, new subclasses, tons of new abilities, and all of the new tactical approaches they entail. This is really just icing on an already delicious cake, however. The Banner Saga 2 is a must-own for anyone who remotely enjoyed its predecessor--and if you haven't touched the original, go try that out too! You don't know what you're missing.","April 28","true","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It’s this feeling of absolute futility that really pushes home the question that all of the characters in the game have to face: Is this the end of the world? Can we even hope to survive? For most, the answer is a very saddening no.\nThe combat mechanics of the game are pretty much a repeat of the first Banner Saga Game with nothing noticeably new brought to the table. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing as I found the combat mechanics to be reasonably solid and the level progression to be adequate enough.\nThe graphics are really what gets me in this game. The rotoscope style coupled with standard animations make for a wonderfully colored and unique looking world. The art style is impressive and really shines through in this game and is one of it’s finest points."\n\nA wonderful game with solid gameplay mechanics, yet lacks replayability. I would still feel comfortable recommending this game, however. Rich artistic feel, wonderful voice-over quality (when it's there) and an engaging story.\n\nSee my full review here:\nhttps://youtu.be/cB41OBm35FE","April 28","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is amazing! I actually owned the first one for the longest time but I was merely too intimidated by it at first to play it, but finally grabbing the nerve to sit down and play revealed how much of a treat this was.\n\nNow the story is quite a treat for people who enjoy grim tales, as it is the end of the world as a massive force of stone-like soldiers called the Dredge are marching from their homes in the north and underground all the way south. Through the lands of horned Giants called Varl, and into the human lands.\nIf you've played the first game you'd know this, and if you skipped it the game will take some time to catch you up on what happened. This story picks up about a few weeks after the finale of the last game. The boats are finished and it is time to sail down stream and make your way to the human capital and hopefully to safety.\n\nI won't go into too much detail about the story, but it is great, especially playing the games back to back. Without spoiling everything there is only one thing I found dissappointing. It feels like some of the characters doesn't get as much time or lines as they desreve. For some it is perfectly fine because they are unimportant or could have been dead by this point.\nThe only one this really bugs me for though is the Prince. Ludin at the end of the game seems like he'd be a bigger deal than he was. but since he can die I understand why. The gave also recieves more mercy for being an indie game with only so much time and team.\n\nGameplay wise, nothing has changed all that much. It is the same as the first game, but the Rank Cap has been pushed up higher. If you are a fan of turn based strategy you'll enjoy this! This game made my eyes sparkle and made me raise my voice in outrage as things happened compared to some other games. You can even tune the difficulty up or down to make it easier or harder for you. Just to find the right experience for you!\nNow for traveling on the road they made it so Clansmen aren't just dead weight, they can now forage and collect extra supplies while you also can train them into soldiers. So you need to decide between how many soldiers you want and how many Clansmen you want to forage for food while you travel. A great improvement from one to two!\n\nUnderstand though that this is not a happy game per say, if you are expecting everything to go your way, don't. Some choices will screw you over and there will be nothing you can do about it. People will betray you and vice-versa, and despite all your hard work sometimes things will go to ♥♥♥♥ and you will have to deal with it.\nIn battle people will get wounded and die, choices will have consiquences and sometimes there just isn't a good choice, managing your caravan will be hard some of the pain from that part has been lessened though. If you want things to go right for the main character, you'll be dissappointed.\n\nStill, if you are a fan of turnbased strategy give this game a try! If you're hesitant, take a look at some videos to help make up your mind. That is what lead to me getting these games and playing through them.

There are some choices that can be made where it may seem like a good idea now but later on could be a bad decision.\n\nAnother unique and interesting mechanice is now you have to take care of a caravan of migrants containing both your soldiers and families.  If morale is high or low, it effects your tactical battles by giving you some positive or negative boosters to combat.  There are even decisions that you have to make during your travels that will effect this as well.\n\nThe tactical gameplay is pretty tough at first.  However once you get used to the idea of how things work, you should be able to get through the battles without too much of an issue.\n\nThe graphics are all hand-drawn images and look spectacular.\n\nGame can be finished around 15 hours and is the 2nd of a 3 part trilogy release.","May 8","true","25.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is direct continuation of story, keeping the game mechanics unchanged. You get one more race, with slightly different combat element, but other than that its the same as original which picks off where original ended. As far as I am concerned, that is completely ok. I liked original, I liked its gameplay, I loved its story and lore and there is no reason to fix something that isnt broken.\n\nJust a warning - if you have not played original, do not play this one. This game expects that you already played the original and makes no excuses for itself if you hadnt.

The story in these games is really epic, compelling, and contains well-thought out lore. They're going for a certain atmosphere and they do a killer job of bringing out that gritty, grim, relaistic viking saga feel.\n\nHowever, I keep on having to convince myself to keep playing because the gameplay is bad. There's just no other way to put it. The intent of this game not having to hit rolls is to make combat soley tactical. I like this idea, however the gameplay mechanics invalidate a lot of the strategy. Because of the way all the stats work, the most effective strategy is to build a super team of all warrior-types, preferably varl (no bards, spellcasters, etc). Have them spec high might, willpower, exertion. Maximize willpower every turn to do as much health damage as possible so that you can one-shot one enemy per turn. I found that playing without this stategy and actually using the armor breaking mechanic or special abilities was a sure way to die. But, using it, I feel like I have a hollow victory because I exploited a flaw and ignored almost every gameplay element. Frankly, it gets old fast. I actually like a tactical experience but this game does not encourage that playstyle. I end up just attacking health with max willpower every turn because it's what works.\n\nMoving on, this game also suffers from a lot of glitches. Some skill point assigments don't permanently set, so you just cannot choose those skills. Some abilities don't even trigger properly in combat. This invalidates a lot of builds and playstyles because you're limited to what works.\n\nAlot of this game is also in RNG: what random encounters you get, where enemies spawn, where one character's runes pop up, etc. The worst instance of it was a boss battle, wherein the fight's difficulty is largely dependant on the RNG of the boss's spawn point. She either spawns right in the middle of your party where you can whack her to death in one turn, or off in some obscure corner where she can't be attacked while she endlessly ressurects the bad guys. RNG like this can make the game extremely hard or easy. From a story perspective, this fits because the game world is gritty and realistic. On the other hand, it just isn't fun to actually play. As a video game, it needs to make some sacrifices of the story to promote fun and engaging gameplay. That's just how this works.\n\nFinally, I have a major issue with the descriptions of various character powers. A lot of them are so poorly worded as to be unclear what they actually do.\n\nOverall, the main point I'm trying to get across is that the developers sacrificed a ton of gameplay budget to create an astonishly beautiful story and world, not just in it's coolness, but also in literally how it looks (art assests). I wish they had spent a little more time tweaking the game mechanics so they actually work and are more fun. Either that, or the devs should just write novels. (Which I would read!)\n\nAs it is, I'm posting this because I don't know if I will finish or not. So far, it's a tentative thumbs up because I'm a reader so I don't mind the game being a glorified e-book.","May 28","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a saga, the games follow the same characters as they struggle against an impending apocalypse. Decisions made in the first Banner Saga game have serious consequences for this game, and you can import your Banner Saga save to preserve continuity of the story. Decisions have grave consequences, but as with the first game, a dark fatalism drives some aspects of effects of your choices. This aspect of Banner Saga 2 makes for a very effective storytelling technique.\n\nThe art is still exceptional and there is a much greater variety of locations (some very vibrant when compared to the winter wasteland of the first game) and character art.\n\nThe general gameplay is the same. It's turn-based strategy, somewhat like a card game with a spatial element. Turn order goes friendly-enemy-friendly-enemy, which means the side with more players still alive isn't getting back to back turns (unless there is only one enemy alive, which initiates pillage mode). Hence there's more emphasis on weakening enemies rather than outright killing them. It's different enough to be interesting. Each character has special abilities that you can leverage to shape the battle or turn the tides. Combat is challenging (and therefore rewarding) but not difficult enough to be frustrating. You can change the difficulty up or down if you'd like.\n\nThe story improves in BS2; you won't be disappointed. There is a point where you know roughly what's going on but your characters don't (though perhaps they should), but your choices don't seem to reflect that knowledge. A lot of the suspense is driven by the fact that the Menders (mages, more or less) simply never tell you what's going on. It makes sense in the story but isn't the most elegant device. These two gripes aside, the character development is good, dread permeates everything you do, and the general story arc deepens. There's a lot of character reflection on what you've done, and in some ways the game is a meditation on leadership during crisis. Life is cheap in BS, just because they're on your roster doesn't mean they're immortal.\n\nStrongly recommend BS2. Play BS first. Each game will take about 10-13 hours. For 20 bucks its sitting at a sweet spot length-wise. It's not a marathon game, which is something I appreciate as I've gotten older and have less time to burn.","May 31","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I just had wrist surgery so I can't use my dominant hand for a couple of weeks, but TBS is possible to play with just one hand as it doesn't require too much input and nothing is time-sensitive. I played through TBS1 and just as I was about to finish, TBS2 was released so thought I'd give it a try... I've loved both games. The story is fantastic and engrossing and the combat is challenging and enjoyable.\n\nSpecifically for TBS2 I would say that they made the combat a lot more interesting and varied. There are many more types of enemies as well as player characters, plus they have fleshed out the character system so you can spend your points from levelling up either on stats or on other benefits such as adding critical chance, or chance to avoid certain types of attacks which means that you can customise the characters more. I'm pretty sure the game is also longer than TBS1.\n\nHighly recommended. If you enjoyed TBS1 then you will enjoy this.","June 3","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pick what you feel you would do if you were that character, and be consistent.
