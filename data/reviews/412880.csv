I can say that it was once a good game, but due to recent updates and recent events I no longer support the creator or the game.\n\nDrifting physics and controller support got very glitchy as of the miata addition, (A car that has been in the game files from day 1 wouldn't break the game)\nI was forum banned for no proper reason, see here; https://steamcommunity.com/app/412880/discussions/0/412449508291314237/\nJDM - Games creator says "Ignore people like modnar" do you agree?\n\n\nI digress there, relevant info to the game here\n\nThe handling and controls are rather intuitive and easy for people to catch on early, however they become a problem and an annoyance down the road as it prevents you from controlling your car 100%, and they fight you in a similar fashion to nfs 2016's controls.\n\nThe car list would be more impressive if all of the cars hitboxes and horsepower capabilities weren't all the same, the only differences in the cars being I believe there's 1 FWD mixed in, look out.\nOh, and transmission gearings kind of make them different in-game SOMETIMES so that counts for something.\n\nAll of the car models are blatantly ripped off from other games, notice how the models are flipped now? And on top of that the real car names were even used, remnants of this exist in the files and you can see it in regedit as well if not on the badges on the cars themselves.\n\nThe "body kits" update was okay, the rim update was lackluster but I didn't complain. The steady stream of new maps, cars, and general content was good for the first month or so.\nUntil people began to abuse broken code, change colours and glitch it out to the extent it would leave assorted coloured bubbles on your screen on the lens flare and other shadows and reflections about the map effectively making it impossible to play, gross impossible cambers, the disabling of collision (and they can still throw you around without collision too!) and addition of thousands of horsepower to ones vehicle.\nAnd then the updates halted, only to be seen once every 2-3 weeks with the addition of broken code and features that didn't really do anything. People began to quit, certain issues made the game unplayable for some and too difficult to figure out for others.\nThis is where I came in, if people had problems, they came to me. I had over 100 players at any given time from DSJ on my list, and I couldn't go an hour without helping someone with something DSJ related whether it be in a private message on steam, or one of the hundreds of forum posts and threads on the official game or steam forums separately (Lots of em)\n\nI got people together for big drift events, did a ton of recordings with the community, and just rallied together support for it and hyped up every little update despite the circumstances while still running FREE tech support (the updates ♥♥♥♥ing sucked and were broken, look you can tell)\n\nStill JDM refuses to address the big bugs and it's been almost a month, if not so already since he broke the game in a bad way. He claims to have all this work done, well let's see it. You rolled out new content like it was a fancy carpet at first, what happened?\n\n\nTL:DR; I helped fix controllers and peoples games, and I got forum banned, all posts deleted and im :steamsalty:\nUsed to be a really good game with a lot of potential until russian updates","April 19","false","99.0"," 127 of 151 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","127","151","4","6"

TL;DR AT BOTTOM.]\n\nThis game used to be great, it had so much potential. Infact my original review stated "The best $7 you would ever spend"\n\nDSJ was first getting off the ground, people were doing lets plays of it. JDM4iK suddenly had a way bigger follower base on the game.\n\nAt the time, the game had great physics and a lot going for it. It was recieving regular updates with original content. It all went downhill from there.\n\nThere was an MX-5 model in the game, and it was ready for release. It wasn't released until several updates later. Before that, there was: A track being changed into day, a multiplayer system, and chat.\n\nEver since the chat system came out, it got worse. People were doing drag races, and blocking roads. Multiplayer got boring. Less updates were happening, less news was coming out.\n\nThere was a physics update which made drifting a lot harder and a lot less realistic. The MX-5 update came out, with even more broken physics than before.\n\nAs of this post, the update simply stole a map from Assetto Corsa and made physics unuseable.\n\n\n\nDuring the course of all of this, the community wasn't listened to one bit, and was permabanned for trying to speak up about all this going on.\n\n\n\nBefore, I would have said you should buy this game. Now? I think it's just not worth it anymore.\n\n3/10. Stolen content, very broken physics, most of the real players have given up on the game.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: This game used to be the best driving game ever. Now it's just some horribly designed mashup of stolen maps and models. The community isn't listened to, and when someone points out something bad they get permabanned from everything.","January 4","false","75.1"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","29","32","2","3"

Tap a wall? Welcome to NASA.\n-If your drifting try and use the e-brake or reg brake they always seems to instantly make the car go straight but not do anything to slow you down.\n-At speed the car basically refuses to turn.\n-It's been said in other reviews but no engine braking/ car stays at the same speed even off the gas.\n-Tracks look and feel like crap. overly bumpy. Kind of like all the terrain is made from flat pieces stacked and rotated.\n-Keeping the car sideways is basically a tap left and right game.\n-If it matters to you, your basically ghost riding. No driver in the car. (the steering wheel does turn tho!)\n-Other then color of the car and rims you can't do anything else to your car.\nThe car tunning is basically camber. You can go stock or full ♥♥♥♥♥♥ both positive and negitive.\n-Buying an engine swap that comes OEM with a turbo doesn't give you a turbo to start with and engine levels are lower than what they produce in real life.\n-Mods are pretty basic. Block, head, pistons, intake, exhuast, ecu, turbo and nitrous.\n-Controller support is a lie. If mines plugged in the car just revs. Can't even switch to keyboard without a restart.\n-No control map or even a way to view controls. But if you've played NFS carbon the controls are about the same.\n-Stupidly small detail but your head lights work great! But your tail lights only work when you press the brake.\n-The money system is pretty simple/odd. No challenges or missions or anything to get money. 10k points = 100 bucks.\n\nGood.\n-Mad skids yo. Not really. I lied.\n-Cars don't actually look to bad.\n-in car view/ cockpit view.\n-Devs seem to be active. More tracks then the game originally launched with already.\n-Engine swaps. RB26 <3\n-Steady FPS.\n\nWeird? I guess.\nIf you use the latest AMD drivers you may have odd graphical errors. When in the upgrade section the power gains for parts only show as the charts sliding over then aren't visible. But we all know AMD drivers suck.\n\nPretty sure the games an ISO / Andorid port. I'm sure if I bothered to look into it I'd find it on the play store. At this time it's not really worth buying. But active devs, so hopefully all the issues will get sorted soon. But right now the games more annoying than fun.\n\nSorry for the messy review.

I personally think you should get some more customization for the car so you can make the car you always wanted as a kid. Add like body customization, window tint, big nice rims and stuff like that.\n\nWhat would be good for online would be that you can choose what map you want to play. And i have noticed that when i play online my fps gets lower and drops more often, i think that is becuase it renders all of the map at the same time instead just a little bit of it. And add so you can talk with people like text press Y. Dont add mics but if you do make it so that you can turn it off in the escape menu so none can annoy you while your drifting.\n\nBut its worth the money.","December 28, 2015","true","44.4"," 22 of 35 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","22","35","3","3"

Is it worth 8AUD? No. Do i regret buying it? No.\n\n*DO NOT LET THE IPHONE STYLE GRAPHICS SWAY YOUR DECISION* the game is extremely addicting particularly due to the drifting physics (Great compared to most simulators, can be a tad better), the inbuilt jukebox(Trap junkies will love it) and the combination of sound effects within each vehicle,\n\nBov's and dose pipes (quite pleasantly) sound exactly as they should in real life and provide me with a sense of immaturity where i build boost and let off the throttle\n(as i do in real life (; ) resulting with the tickling of my nuts as the glorious sounds of zuTUTUTU222tototo is released.\nEngine sounds within this game also seem to have been provided effort (SR20s sound like SR20s!!!).\n\nin conclusion, if your a car enthusiast (particularly JDM) and you have the money to spare, buy this game to prove to your mates that your not a ♥♥♥♥ c-u-nt at drifting as they have called you IRL and redeem your self from the humility you recieved as the sl00ty Gangas and elderly pensioners give you the little finger as you one wheel peel your open diff na sh!tbox around the local Maccas CarPark.\n\n*Note to car enthusiasts i believe the R34 is a 25gt-t not a GT-R as seen with the z-tune bodykit hence the RB25 in the car specs tab (makes sense right, drifting game = rwd).

And online multiplayer, and controller support.  This developer is patching the game several times per day with huge changes.  It's surely in active development, but the least he could do is put up the Early Access banner.\n\nMy frames per second in multiplayer is absolutely horrible.

The game will roughly cost you about £4.99, which I think is a reasonable price for a game like this, but I would like to see more cars, more maps, and more tuning added in the future. If you haven't gotten this game already I recommend you go out, and buy it (If you like cars, and drifting of course.) I would also like to see private servers to play with friends, because when you are online with people they sometimes accidently hit you. Yes this can happen on the private servers to, but in the end you can at least skype your friends, and tell them to go on at a time.

I somewhat recommend this game\nbut it does need a polish on a few areas listed above since there's too many fanboys\noverhyping this game.\n\nOverall score: 7/10\nIt's not a AAA title like Gran Turismo but it does have potential to fill in the blank spaces GT has left behind on the drift scene that it was capable of.\n\nOfficial review of TeamA99E\nDrift Warriors -  ドリフト・ウォリアズ","February 6","true","7.1"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","12","21","2","1"

Well at the start I a bit afraided, because the drifting in racing games not my strong side, i never liked drifting tasks in NFS and other games, but this game is surprised me. Drifting here is enough simple, controls are good, so its shouldn't make for you any trouble.\nIn a game you will found a lot of cars what you can buy them if you have enough money, also the customization is very good, the game have enough deep tuning system. The money for tuning or new cars you can earn by drifting, because when you do this you earn points, for example if you earn 70000 points, its equal to 700 dollar.\n\nAlso in this game you will found a enough maps, track editor, coop and multiplayer feature. The game music is good, well complements the game feeling. The graphic looks very nice, the cars are really has a realistic view.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+nice graphic\n+nice music\n+easy controls\n+good customization\n+track editor\n+multiplayer\n\n-no trading cads and steam achievements\n-"only" drift maybe can be repetitive\n\nWell this game is looks interesting, however there you should only drift its also can bring for you a lot of fun, because this game have a lot of cars, good customization and multiplayer too. So i think if you like racing games you should try this one, especially if its got a good discount.\n\n7/10\n","February 6","true","3.9"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","18","33","2","0"

I was right.\n\n2: Mechanics are incomplete, the physics are off to a nice start, however they are not finished and the braking mechanics are really broken.\n\n3: Performance issues dispite having very simple graphics, including little to no foliage and little to no traffic the performance is surprisingly bad.\n\n4: Game is themed in Japan but there is no Japanese music or Japanese themed music.\nInfact the general mastered quality of the soundtrack is prodigiously bad, which is unfortunate when music is so critical to driving immersion.\n\n5: Multiplayer is broken, maximum capcity as of this review is 100 players online in 1 server.\nIt does have lan support, if your into Lan parties.\n\nIf you've an interest in this title, I would advise you wait, add it to your following and see how it develops.\nOtherwise you will probably be dissappointed if you try it as is.","January 6","false","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Its great for an arcade style of drifting somewhat of how the Need for Speed series is as its not as serious or simulator like for drifting. The brake and hand brake can be glitchy as the creator behind the game tends to mess with it between updates. Feels like the game will be one day abandoned as he is focused on many projects all at once including new ones. It was nice when we had a lobby for many ppl to join and not be restricted to 12/16 but in the end this was a free mobile game ported to steam which i notice costs more than the 6.99 i originally paid.\nThe game lacks real courses has a few cars that are nice to drift with, would be solid if the game had a 1st and 2nd gen rx7.\nSeems like the courses could be further refines and the track editor is very limiting also you cannot share the track editor online. Customization on the cars is mediocre while the game features a 93 honda civic hatch back with upgrading/swapping a rear wheel drive motor the car still stays front wheel drive making it the only car that can grip in the game. None of the other cars are grippy for grip racing as the game is set up for only drifting.\n\nI would recommend it if your a fan of drifitng but i would not pay the current cost of what is being asked for now. Seems like there is a big chance for this game to be abandoned in 2017+ with the mobile need for speed like features.\n\nPros\n73 skyline, ae87, fd3s, gtr skyline, 240sx, and japanese cars\nQuick arcade like drift style good for small amounts of time for boredom\nBackwards entry, 360 entry, drift point combo multiplyer\nQuick to pick up if you are used to drifitng on games\n\nCons\nDevelopement of levels\nMultiplayer limited to 12/16 players " was unlimited at one point then there was a 64 slot server room later removed "\nAkina level is very glitchy\nTrack editor is limited with little features to use / no capabilities to upload online to share\nSometimes upgrades may make your car feel grippier than before\nneeds more refine with controls and more design in levels\nBland level design\nMain menu is simple very mobile game like\nHonda civic in a drifting game.... Not even the rare 4wd model, with motor swap civic stays fwd :(\nNeeds a 1st and 2nd gen rx7, 73 celica, mr2, mazda cosmo, nissan fairlady z 91, silvia s13, s14, levin corolla or ae86 coupe corolla, mitsubishi evolution any model any other japanese classic would be nice.\nController support can be hit or miss on some people","March 10","true","24.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","1"

Besides this updates are being rolled out every day it seems and the game has improved dramatically since it's release.\n\nThere are a few features I would like to see implimented into the game such as a chat box, players have no way of communicating with each other.\n\nSecondly there needs to be some sort of private lobby support, so you can play with your friends without running into other people online. Many people playing in Akina want to twin drift up and down the mountain however you're constantly crashing into other players.\n\nThirdly the crash/bump physics need to be greatly improved, when you bump a barrier or another car you completely stop in your tracks, these pysics are and unrealistic just generally annoying to play with. Another thing I would like to add is the multiplayer needs some optimization, from your point of view other players cars are jumping around everywhere and overall look very buggy.\n\nAside from the negaives this game is getting better everyday and I hope the developers stay focused and listen to their community to make this a great game.","January 3","true","24.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Music volume can be controlled if you don't like it, engine/exhaust/tire sounds do their part well, and the visuals are a step-above the old NFS-Underground games.\n\nIf you're looking to play with a controller, wait until full-support is confirmed, or don't bother as it won't work.\n(long story short, it's both game & controller related, involving trigger command-axis issues)\n\nThat^ said, I have been enjoying the game with my Logitech G27, set-up to behave like a drifting go-kart of sorts. The game offers some level of 'customization', which devolves to body-color/wheel color combos, and what engine/perfomance-stage parts you choose. There are a fair amount of JDM cars to choose from, and PLENTY of engine-swap choices (my current/favorite combo is a "S240" [a.k.a 240sx] with a ~500hp KA24DE[-T] motor).\n\nThe physics are arcade-ish, but feel more 'weighed-down' than the NFS2015 "200mph EVERYWHERE" behavior, think the old Underground games with a hint-more realism and weight.\n\nIs there $7-worth of content ? - debatable\nIs there $7-worth of entertainment in the game ? - I'd say yes;\nBetween the solo-mode and the lag-chaos of online, the occasional online tandem (that doesn't end in cars getting launched to space - although still humorous) and the solo practice of finding the sweet-spot for your driving style and the cars perfomance, I could see anyone (who's done the research/effort and didn't just go "GAME BROKE PLZ FIX) enjoying themselves for around 7-hours total.","January 5","true","28.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Music volume can be controlled if you don't like it, engine/exhaust/tire sounds do their part well, and the visuals are a step-above the old NFS-Underground games.\n\nIf you're looking to play with a controller, wait until full-support is confirmed, or don't bother as it won't work.\n(long story short, it's both game & controller related, involving trigger command-axis issues)\n\nThat^ said, I have been enjoying the game with my Logitech G27, set-up to behave like a drifting go-kart of sorts. The game offers some level of 'customization', which devolves to body-color/wheel color combos, and what engine/perfomance-stage parts you choose. There are a fair amount of JDM cars to choose from, and PLENTY of engine-swap choices (my current/favorite combo is a "S240" [a.k.a 240sx] with a ~500hp KA24DE[-T] motor).\n\nThe physics are arcade-ish, but feel more 'weighed-down' than the NFS2015 "200mph EVERYWHERE" behavior, think the old Underground games with a hint-more realism and weight.\n\nIs there $7-worth of content ? - debatable\nIs there $7-worth of entertainment in the game ? - I'd say yes;\nBetween the solo-mode and the lag-chaos of online, the occasional online tandem (that doesn't end in cars getting launched to space - although still humorous) and the solo practice of finding the sweet-spot for your driving style and the cars perfomance, I could see anyone (who's done the research/effort and didn't just go "GAME BROKE PLZ FIX) enjoying themselves for around 7-hours total.","January 5","true","28.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a great time killer if you want to take a break from one of the flagship racing games just to screw around in an arcadey drift game\n\nThe game is $7... it's fun and it's getting updated frequently. you can't really go wrong\n\nPROS:\n-Detailed car models and reastic engine/turbo sounds\n-Decent selection of drift/japanese cars that keep being added to the game\n-Easy to get cash and figure out the controls\n-Gives you the satisfaction of thinking you're actually decent at racing games\n\nCONS:\n-Multiplayer, it's not very good but it definitely has potential\n-Not a lot of maps but im sure more will be added\n\nStill better physics than need for speed. 10/10","January 4","true","17.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Also every single car in this game has major understteer problems and feint drifting in this game is physically impossible ( you do not or should not have to use the E-Brake to feint drift look it up dammit) the dev should have thought about looking at racing scripts before uploading this to steam because it has some of the worst mechanics i have ever experienced plus it feels more like an arcade game. The inside viewmodels are absolutely terrible and some of the years on the cars are completely off. I do love the choices in cars and engines though; sadly this seems to be the only experience this dev had with cars  though because this game is so bad im considering a refund you seriously need to fix this now!!! AND BEFORE YOU SAY ITS ONLY 7 BUCKS WELL I COUULD HAVE JUST BOUGHT A REAL RACING GAME FOR THAT MUCH IT IS SERIOUSLY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ME OFF!!! FIX IT NOW YOUU HAVE THE MONEY NOW WITH THE REVENUE FROM STEAM THIS IS TERRIBLE. Dont upload something if your the only person that thinks its right it feels like the damn thing wasnt even tested most of the tracks have invisible walls that halt you in you tracks. Also the engine rpms will drop if you excede certain angles WTF!!! What do you think happens when a tire has no traction you think it has a mind of its own and decides to drop rpm.............. You cant stop when going in revers your car simpoly glides backwards for 100 feet and they still have not fixed the controller support as of 2/20/2016 they clame they did but no no no they did not at all and the fix they posted has the potential to seriously mess up the game also the "fix" guide is so bad they dont even show you everything in the regedit which btw they want you toi edit if you want to play with a controller this should have been patched in so the average user doesnt make there game unplayable the creator of this game has no regard for the consumer only his buddies and doesnt care if it is unpayable because steam is already paying him for it.","February 15","false","2.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I'd give it an 8.7/10\n\nThere aren't many maps, but honestly you don't need more than those that are already in the game! They teach you how to drift  slow and steady and by tuning the car and messing around you can get your drift skills to the max, and make combos that go around 1.000.000. Points :D Soon you'll be drifting like a boss.\n\nThe bad thing on this game though is, you cannot put on spoilers or change the bodykit a bit. You can however change the color of the rims/body and angle your tires or widen them. I don't mind it not being filled with tuning possiblilities like in Need for Speed, but it could make the game more fun.\nSo customisation would be awesome for an update. Maybe a few more cars (not just JDM) ;)\n\n\n\nI'm glad finally some racing game put in a Nissan 350z in it ^_^","January 4","true","8.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game is not good. They physics are abismal, the sound cuts in and out online, controller support is nonexistant, and the point system is glitchy (you lose point on impact with anything, and i mean anything). The maps are poor quality, like relatable to need for speed underground, the first one from 2003! The only real redeaming factor for me is the fact I can mod it REALLY easily and make straight up joke cars. For god sake, I made a s2000 swapped with a 2jz that had so much power the number was an exponent! XD I really wouldnt recomend this game to anyone being I don't think its worth what you pay for.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pez2k/recommended/412880/","pez2k","pez2k","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pez2k/","775 products in account","A quick summary: this is a very rudimentary release about a year of two of development away from being an actual game, and the store page hugely exaggerates the features on offer.\n\nDriving: Initially in the only available starter car, the physics seem decent with a fairly natural if exaggerated feel to the drifting. However, as soon as you add power or change to another car it starts to fall apart, with bizarre spins, slides and acceleration in unexpected directions. It feels more like a set of predefined reactions to certain inputs rather than any actual physics simulation, and once you deviate from basic powerslides it breaks.\n\nGraphics: The car models are serviceable if rather low-poly (ignoring the large holes in some), but the tracks are very, very basic - some games of the 1990s had more trackside detail. The 'traffic' only exists on one track, and seems to be mainly static cars with extremely low levels of detail.\n\nGameplay: The only gameplay loop that exists is that scoring drift points gives the player a small amount of money per point, which they can use to upgrade then score more points. There is no other gameplay at all.\n\nUI: The menus are relatively clean and functional, however simply viewing any performance upgrade seems to immediately purchase it with no confirmation.\n\nAudio: The sound effects are passable, the highlight being the turbo sounds. The music is not to my own tastes, but the production is at least okay.\n\nCar culture: The choice of cars is well selected for a drifting game. While bodykits are only currently implemented for one car, and there are only 5 choices of wheels, the sheer presence of visual upgrades at least scores a point here. The engine swapping feature is also decent, although the stats for the engines generally bear very little resemblance to the real engines that they are named after.\n\nOverall: The game frankly lacks even the most basic levels of polish or even gameplay, and has some jarring inconsistencies in the quality of the art assets. While the developers clearly have put some heart into it and are continuing to work on the game, I wouldn't recommend a purchase now unless it's 90% off and you're happy with 20 minutes or so of just toying around. Hopefully the support keeps coming, and in a year or two this may be worth the budget price.","February 18","false","1.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The cars are great, the upgrade system is nice, the maps are meh okayyy, but trying to play this game with a keyboard only (especially with all the drifting that requires to constantly change steering directions, releasing and pressing the gas to coordinate clean drifts) makes it a NIGHTMARE to control your car. Like I said this game COULD be a lot of fun, but being restricted to a keyboard in a game where the only way to play it properly would be with a controller, in all honesty, makes it really hard to enjoy. If you implement FULL controller support (xbox 360 joystick, even the d-pad for christs sake) sometime soon, I would gladly change this review from a thumbs down to a thumbs up. But for now, I'm kind of feeling like I just wasted 7 dollars on game that's virtually unplayable.","February 3","false","27.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game seems super incomplete and hacky and broken.\n\nI hope they continue working on it.  I would like a fun ricing game where you can do stupid mods on your car and race some nice mountain tracks, etc.\n\nUnfortunately, so far this feels like early alpha.\n\nUsing a gamepad won't really work.  Partial gamepad support implies that you can play with it, but with limited functionality.  I couldn't even figure out how to make it work.  The configuration is very janky.  I couldn't figure out how to remove a secondary control once it was set.\n\nThe physics are silly, the cars automatically countersteer, the brakes don't really work,\n\nThe controls on the keyboard have certain  things hardcoded.  Pressing R puts you at the start of the track, even if you have assigned R to another function.\n\nThe tracks are very coarse.  The centre line is made up of big linear segments.  The terrain is really repetitive.  It feels like it's all just placeholders.\n\nIt looks like this game is being actively developed, so maybe it will turn into something some day, but for now it's really not worth buying, and I really don't see how it got such decent reviews.  It should still be early access.","February 14","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Big Pro!\nCar Looks - Cars look amazing.\nCustomization - There are some cool options and the devs add more and more.\nConstant Updates - It is great that the game gets constant updates. The devs are active and so is the community!\nCockpit View - It is a great thing to have and if you have a wheel, then you are set!\n\nCons:\nGlitches - This game is a glitch fest (At the time I am writing this which would be April 4th 2016), I won't lie. Braking downhill is sh$t, hitting the wall or someone else at a high speed glitches your car, and so on.\nTrack Graphics - They are not that good, not a big con but it takes away from the immersion.\nCar Interior - Not detailed enough, especially when the game has a cockpit view, you would want to have some sort of detail. Though keep in mind this game costs $10, so having a cockpit view is still great!\nController Support - (at the time of writing this) Pure balls. Seriously it is not that good.\nCar Handling - There are some cars that handle like complete crap, that definitely needs to be fixed.\n\nTL;DR\nOverall, while glitchy, if you are a car enthusiast and you like drifting, turbo flutter, and JDM.

As far as I can tell, very little in this game was actually made by the developer.\nThe soundtrack is entirely composed of EDM from various internet music labels, of which the developer most likely didn't ask to use.\nThe maps are each very different, and it's hard to believe that most of them were made by the same person, and some feel as if they were made from a completely different game engine and physics.\nThe car models all seem to be ripped from different sources, as there is very little similar features in each car; most noticeably the inclusion and lack of roll cages and sponsors in the cars. It's also strange how only some of the cars have body kits, and two of the three have the same roll cage and sponsors. Strange.\nThere's also so many problems involving the physics and audio, but they're not a big deal compared to the amount of cash this is making off of entirely stolen content.\n\nI can't point to any sources for the stolen models, but if you look a bit I'm sure you could find them. If the content wasn't stolen and my 240z wouldn't flip over after every corner, I might've really loved this game. But it's so hard knowing that this developer didn't do much more than throw a bunch of stolen or stock graphics and models together and sell it on steam for five bucks.","May 17","false","7.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm enjoying the game as it is, despite being in early stages. It's not your average arcade drifter where you can simply flick the wheel and become the next imagining of Takumi Fujiwara. It actually takes a bit of tweaking your car (with modifications and wheel alignment) and practice to get used to it all, which is exactly what I've been looking for.\n\nFor being a $6.99 game, it's not expected to be perfect, but I believe it is worth it, granted if you can get past the initial aggravation of dealing with the physics. This game certainly has potential to become great despite its flaws or what it lacks and I hope the developers have a lot in store for 2016. In the meantime, I'll be sliding around the mountain in my 240SX, perfecting my drifting.","January 4","true","26.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

If, for example, you expect to run no more than 1.2 Bar (17.4 psi), a gauge that reads up to 1.5 Bar (21.8 psi) is perfect - it's good to have a little bit of headroom so you can recognise overboost conditions.\n\nYou may be aware that some boost gauges read positive pressure and engine vacuum; a vacuum scale is very handy for setting up an adjustable blow-off valve, general tuning and faultfinding. Speaking from experience, it's also the easiest way to identify when a small hose has popped off the intake manifold. Certainly, where possible, go for a boost gauge that shows vacuum.\n\nNote that the sweep of the needle is important for viewing accuracy - the greater the sweep, the more likely you'll make a correct reading. Another important factor is the diameter of the gauge - the most common diameter is 52mm, but smaller 40mm units can also be bought. Unless mounting space is an issue (which you'll need to determine before making a purchase) we'd opt for the larger size gauge, as they're considerably easier to read.\n\nAnd what's better - a metric or imperial boost gauge? This comes down mainly to personal preference. Psi (pounds per square inch), kilopascals (kPa) and Bar are the most common pressure units - whichever of these suits you is fine.\nYour budget will determine whether you'll be using a mechanical or, possibly, an electronic boost gauge. Mechanical boost gauges, which use an internal Bourdin tube, can be bought brand new from as little as $40. Electronic boost gauges, however, can run to several hundred dollars. As the name implies, an electronic boost gauge is fed an electrical signal from a remote pressure sensor. Electronic boost gauges have a few advantages - they generally have slightly better accuracy, most have a peak recall function and, because the gauge is fed an electric signal from a remote pressure sensor, there's no requirement to run an air hose into the cabin.\n\nInstalling a Mechanical Boost Gauge\n\nWhere to Find the Optimal Pressure Source\n\nThe best spot to connect a boost gauge is the intake manifold; most typically by 'T-ing' into one of the existing manifold hoses. So why is the intake manifold best, you ask?First, manifold vacuum won't register on boost/vacuum gauges unless you make a connection downstream of the throttle body (ie inside the intake manifold). Only boost pressure can be measured along the path between the turbocharger and throttle body.The second advantage of connecting the boost gauge to the intake manifold is you'll receive a more accurate representation of actual boost - the amount of positive pressure received by the engine. Connecting a boost gauge anywhere between the turbo compressor and throttle will give a too-high boost reading. Thanks to the inevitable restriction through the intercooler core, intercooler plumbing and throttle body, an engine suffers a boost pressure loss on-route to the manifold.\nClick for larger image Using a 1994 Subaru Impreza WRX as a demo, we T'd our boost gauge (a second-hand Japanese import job) into one of the hose connections on the topside of the manifold. The hose we selected was one that connects to the purge control solenoid on the underside of the manifold.\nNote that - instead of cutting the factory solenoid hose - we fitted a T-piece to the existing end and added another short length of hose to hook onto the manifold connection. This means, if we later decide to remove the boost gauge, the original hose will be long enough to reattach to the manifold connection. The third port of the T-piece is dedicated to the boost gauge.\nAnd what sort of T-pieces should be used? Brass fittings are certainly the most durable but for a completely stealth installation you can't go past the plastic T-pieces used on 993cc Daihatsu Charade carby turbo engines. We're led to believe that the same T-pieces are fitted to atmo versions as well. These beaut little T-pieces can be picked up from the wreckers for free!\nTo ensure none of your boost gauge hoses pop apart, the vacuum hose clamps used on the Daihatsu Charade Turbo are, again, ideal and available for free. We didn't bother with these since we don't expect to run mega boost.\nFour millimetre rubber vacuum hose - available from auto parts stores for around $3 per metre - is fine for running from the manifold to the in-cabin gauge. Vacuum hose offers OE-level durability and it integrates into the underbonnet scenery perfectly.\n\nRouting the Hose\n\n\nThere are a couple of things to remember when routing the hose from the manifold to the in-cabin gauge. The hose should not be kinked, it should be kept well away from intense heat sources and it should not foul the operation of any moving parts - particularly the throttle!We routed our boost gauge hose around the factory blow-off valve tube, beneath the top-mount intercooler, parallel with some factory tubes that run along the firewall and, finally, though the firewall. A couple of cable ties were used to secure the hose into position.\n\nMost cars have several firewall openings that are capped with a rubber or plastic seal; we'll use one of these to pass through our boost hose. Have a good look under the bonnet to find a seal that isn't too crowded with wires and/or cables and prise it away from the firewall using a flat-blade screwdriver - be careful not to strain any wires or cables from inside the car. Next, enlarge the hole in the seal so it's big enough to accept the 4mm rubber hose - this can be done with a pair of pointed scissors or a razor. With that done, refit the seal to the firewall and poke the boost hose through to the cabin.\n\nNote - in no circumstance should a hose, cable or electrical wire rub against the metal edge of the firewall hole. Install a firewall seal from another vehicle or use a sheath (even just a short length of rubber hose) to avoid contact with that sharp metal edge.\n\nWorking from the driver's foot well, route the hose beneath the dashboard so it won't foul the operation of the pedals, steering, handbrake or any other controls. Again, use cable ties to secure the hose at various locations to prevent it falling somewhere it shouldn't - like on your feet while driving! Cut the hose in the vicinity where you intend to mount the gauge.\n\nMost boost gauges incorporate a bulb for nighttime illumination. Two electrical terminals can usually be found on the back of the gauge - one for a positive electrical feed and one for Earth. Note that - unless LEDs are used for illumination rather than a conventional bulb - you can hook either terminal to the positive or Earth wire. A conventional bulb is not polarity conscious.\n\nSo where should you wire the illumination bulb to? Well, the best place is to connect into the existing instrument illumination circuit - this enables the boost gauge to illuminate along with the rest of the vehicle's instruments.\n\nIn the case of this particular install, we powered the boost gauge bulb from the illumination circuit for the cigarette lighter (which is immediately alongside). We simply T'd into the two wires that are used to illuminate the cigarette lighter surround and ran the appropriate length of hook-up wire to the ashtray area. To enable easy installation and future removal, we soldered two short lengths of wire onto the gauge terminals and adjoined the ends with a pair of spade connectors.\nNote that most (all?) cars' electrical systems will be able to cope with an extra bulb without being overloaded.","May 1","true","23.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Illegal races?  This is your game!\n\nI love this game, I lovespeed and cars. I remember when after school I went to arcades to play the classic Daytona with my friends. This is not "Daytona" but a nice version of an illegal racing, in your illegal garage with the chance of putting some stuff in your car.\n\nThis is a really good game with a lot of options a the garage to set up your engines, cambers, offsets, and, of course, all tunning stuff related! Of course, takes money from your budget. At the beginning, you have to start with a base car. The good news: painting it's free! Then with the money you will be able to change the engine, adding extra HP it's quite nice. Don't forget to check the turbo, adding nitro and many other interesting things. Of course, we can change the body, swap, and rims!\n\nGameplay: I suggest a joystick, but also keyboard helps. You have the LAN option, playing alone or with friends at the Japan highways or multiplayer version, with other people and try to get some money. You have a chat option and summon friends to race or just having fun drifting. You have a lot of things to do.\n\nYou have two cameras options, third person, and first person, I always like third but both are great.\n\nGraphics: Graphics are not bad. We are not talking about GTA V but I really like the work of the artist team. Cars are different, you can personalize colors. Textures are cool too.\n\nMusic: The best part of it. The sound of the engine is different from first person camera, also the music. And the themes are just great. Enjoy good music for speed? You gonna have it here!\n\nCreating new scenarios: I think this is the big one of the game. You can create your own racetrack! I tried, but I have to say you need patience. The editor seems not to be complicated but you need to have some time.\n\nExtras: There's no presentation of the game after the "made by unity". You just go to the garage. I suggest to fix that, would be nice to have a good presentation of the game.\n\nYou can subscribe the forum. You'll get an extra car if you validate your Steam account. Also, many gamers share their scenarios created with the editor and you can download them for free! It's a great community. I loved that.\n\nAll extras of this games deserve a 3/5. Of course, all games could be better but this one, I loved it.\n\nSuit up boys and girls, it's time for speed!","February 27","true","3.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This time, they've taken the whole experience of having to spend $2 per round at an arcade full of random people constantly watch your skills to your own PC!\n\nThis is a really great game with a ways you can customize your rides and pimp them out to your dreamed wives in your garages to set up your engines, cambers, offsets, and so on. At the beginning, you have to start with a cocky ride, but as you play along you're bound to get rich and make it rain all over cars.

It needs more body mods other than camber, and the paint only has one option of metallic.\nI think these can be fixed in a few small patches which isnt bad due to updates being released every two day.

It's also not a garbage can, but it would be nice if it wouldn't freeze randomly during gameplay. The graphics are decent, but some cars need some word in the 3d modeling. Some front bumpers are wider the the fenders at the joinpoints, as if it is a widebody front bumper but noone botherd doing the fenders. Also, if you like tons of power, camber, and antilag backfire at rev limiter, then this game is for you.\n\nHere's some pro's and cons:\n\nPROS-\nInital D (I think?) style graphics\nGreat suspension tuning (Offset and Camber)\nBad color choice possibility\nWell designed tyre/tire smoke\nMultiplayer\nLevel Editor\n\nCONS-\nCrashes/Freezes/Stops responding during gameplay randomly\nMultiplayer spawn car collidence issues\nNo cosmetic modifactions (Other then wheels, and not many at that!)\nNo custom colors\nNo bodypanel editing (Removing bumpers, bonnets/hoods, etc.)\n\nMy overall score would be 7/10. It's a great addition to your collection for 7$/five pounds.","January 29","true","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would also like a custom music player because the standard dubstep songs get old really quick. Different maps would also be appreciated and if the roads can be made smooth rather than having bumps, that would be great. AND OBVIOUSLY FIX THE CONTROLLER SUPPORT!!!!!!!

The engine swaps and engine mods are what really keep me coming back.

You easily slide too much as if its oil on the ground, you can't really steer that well either in the drift. The handbrake makes your car go straight, it doens't push you to continue the drift.\nBut I found a solution, Using the handbrake you can tap it quite fast as you drive in the corners and get a quite nice slide. Though you must yank a but on the throttle button and handbrake. You get the hang of it after a while.\n\nThere are 13 different vehicles so far and you can tune them meaning, changing engine blocks, pistons, head covers, intake, exahust manifolds, turbos, ecu and nitro. You can also swap between 18 different engines and tune them.\nAlso, you can put a massive and i mean massive camber and offset!\n\nI recommend this game, i spent 1,9 hours in-game so far and it isnt much. But I can clearly see alot of potential in this game, though it needs a bit tuning.","January 25","true","28.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

If you are into drifting on Carx Drift, Forza Motorsports Or Horizon you will like this. Only complaint is the Deacceleration response is known existent. Would like to see better tire grip physics, and gearing response changes. Right now it feels like every gear is ice with the higher gears being the iciest off limits. The brakes don't feel very confident I find my self guessing if they will do the job or I have to much speed for them to and understeer. The boost effects and engine responses are spot on though. Drifting low power cars feel way more realistic then Horizon or Forza.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND SUPPORTING THIS!!!!","February 3","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nobody has ever had such audio.\n+Really immersive.\n+Multiplayer.\n+Tandems.\n+Track editors.\n+Manual gearbox.\n\nBottom line. Game has pretty noticable flaws which made me want to get a refund, but, after that I learned to appreciate the good things and ignore the bad ones.

I brought this game about a month and a half ago, at first it looked like a game full of potential but with not much to offer. After having a doubt for a day or 2 i finally decided that any game with a decent few cars and a few different maps was worth the small price of 5 pounds. i remember the first time i played it, i must of spent 2 hours on a row in the game, the game was so good and brought back some amazing memories back to when i was building my now 320BHP 180sx. i remember getting 4M drift score and losing it all on a wall cause the brakes where waay too weak. i remember buying that beautiful spirit R as its my dream car, i feel in love with it and since then is my favourite car. I recorded every step of the way, update by update to one day look back to  the beginning of this Amazing game. i knew by the regular updates that by time the game will only get better, but i had no idea it could happen so fast and for that im grateful JDM4iK. Just keep doing what you do and people get ready for the Best Racing game to ever hit pc :D good luck.\n\nPS: I can not wait to see them awesome bodykits on my cars and a few new rims. also i think we kinda need more upgrades and being able to tune the car, not big things. only necessaries and basic things that a real drifter would need to drift his car. a 1KBhp would be awesome to have and finally that really needed controller support :D I feel like im writing to Santa here haha but i have faith :D peace Mfukas!!!","January 29","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The concept is simple but to fully control your car it really takes a little time to figure out. Making money early on in the game can be hard but once you build your first car a little you can start to really bring in good money. The engine swaps and engine mods are what really keep me coming back. If you can get past the odd control scheme and not 100% accurate car and engine sounds this is an amazing game for the low price tag.","January 19","true","29.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But i'm sceptical about "drift" games (please regard shovelware on android and ios).\nThen It was featured on steam sales, at full price though. So I decided to check it out.\nAs the trailer started to play the first thing I noticed was the anti lag- rev limiter back fire (machinegun fire). This was the reason that I wanted to give it a try. For 7€.\n\nLoads of cars (for a beginning game) Great Icons and lots of tuning options. Engine swaps do fully mean another engine (my V8 240 sx is a beast) Engines are in par with their real life counterparts.\nThis game still needs lots of content, but for 7€ This thing rocks. I love drifting and I drift in every racinggame. Thus to say this is a fun little drift game with loads of updates every few days!\n\n-update- Just managed to pull a + 15 000 000 points drift. I'm hapy.","February 8","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And must say im still loving it! I would say a good hour is needed into the game to get some upgrades and learn the handling to make it more fun!\n\nIve played many driving games over the years and modded games to enable drifting. But for once to jump straight into a drift game is nice.\n\nPro's:\nGood selection of cars (so far)\nGood tuning options\nCar graphic quality\nTURBO FLUTTER\nEase of earning money\n\nCon's:\nSome maps can be a bit glitchy\nLoose points from hitting bumps every so slightly (would like to see improved)\n\nAside that its a £5 drifting game!

It is amazing it is literally as the title says, drift streets japan. You drift, get money, tune car or buy new car, drift, get money do more tuning stuff, drift. and inbetween all that you get quite a bit of tuning from engine swaps (2jz s15 full pink!!) to nos turbos, pistons (even on on the rx7 rotary :3).\n\nThe auto countersteer sorta thing is nice for just keyboard users it makes using a keyboard possible but would like an option to turn it on or off for those with controllers or wheels.\n\nYou can change camber of your wheels both ways so really stupid far out like the usual civic drivers do or the really stupid inwards one which silly people do. So you get quite a bit of camber to change, you can change the color of your car for free even the wheels. Multiplayer gets so busy it hammers the ♥♥♥♥ out of the internet though i like multiplayer when it is busy but the netcode is using up way to much internet for it considering only your lights and tire smoke actually render but not on the other cars etc.\n\nWastegate noise in cockpit mode is funny.\n\n¬¬¬¬¬Things i would like improved on or added.\n\n- Interiors on cars updated higher resolution etc,\n\n- Turdo not spooling when reversing. so no pssshh puwuuwuwwuf (you know the sound)\n\n- Braking not leading to reversing more like you stop then press d again to reverse would be nice\n\n- Stable multiplayer not people teleporting all over the place, also the ability to see headlights\n\n- Please add a horn so we can beep for tandems\n\n- Better controller support, for some reason my basic cheap controller has steering where it goes up and down on the actual analogue stick rather than left and right, its really confusing also had to unplug to use keyboard because controller was ♥♥♥♥♥ and keyboard wouldn't work with controller plugged in.\n\n- Please add the ability to flash our headlights to each other too. Would be nice to blink somebody whos driving slowly so you can say please speed up or move out the way. Obviously a horn would be better but come on so it is basically high beam or low beam like 3 modes for it just by pressing the flash headlights key.\n\n- Day Night Cycle on multiplayer map (all maps really)\n\n- Maybe add more to the multiplayer map so players can go explore a world while drift.\n\n- Chat box in bottom left corner for deaf people or people who don't have sound on\n\n- Better right click drag camera support my mouse goes off to the edge of my second screen when i do it and the camera hardly moves at all then when i let go of the right i then gotta alt tab back into the game\n\n- Make the tuning on the engine parts feel a little more unique and different from each other when you put them on your car most of them don't really do anything. Exhaust doesn't even sound different either just engine sounds different because its now a 2jz and not an sr20\n\nI know it seems like a lot of requests and requires a lot of improvement i have over 20hours in this game it is addictive and nice to relax to and makes you smile when your drifting with a few others and it looks a bit like a snake. It has epic moments, it is also hilarious when you see 10 people join the server drive then all the cars fly off into the air..\n\nTo put it bluntly. It needs a lot of work but it is fun and for £4.99 i like playing it. I feel happy and relaxed when i do. Just go sideways and all is good or park up and laugh at people flying all over the place while trying to looking cool xD.\n\nIs fun is good has a lot of potential needs a lot of work more fun than schitty nfs.","January 10","true","109.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AE86__/recommended/412880/","AE86__","AE86_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AE86__/","47 products in account","I know I don't have much hours on this game but I would like the write a review. First of all, you get what you pay for with this game (physics wise). The physics with drifting are very annoying especially since there is no controller support yet, you  don't feel confident as you enter a drift and it always tries to snap you the other way. It is quite annoying and on maps with long, swinging corners this isn't ideal. That being said, this game is only 7 dollars and you get a lot for what you pay for, there is upwards of 10 cars that you can modify to your liking. They have camber and wheel spacing as well as a bunch of colors for the body and wheels. You are also able to do mad engine swaps, for example I have a fully built 2jz that has about 700 bhp plus nitrous. You are able to choose headers, turbos, nitrous, ecu, exhaust, and much more. There is even multiplayer to play with other people or friends. Though the multiplayer is laggy since there is only one server you can't really risk more than a 2 person tandem since the car movements update every few seconds. It is very choppy and most people run into you and make you flip over. Overall, this game has very little flaws (the flaws though are big ones) minus the buggy multiplayer, and physics of the car there are a lot of veriety in cars and upgrades. If the developer changed some of the physics to not be as annoying and better multiplayer, they could easily sell this game for another 10 dollars more. Overall it gives you alot for a game that only costs 7 dollars. But, don't complain to much because you have to remember this is a new indie game and there are many bugs still being worked out.","January 17","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are into drifting on Carx Drift, Forza Motorsports Or Horizon you will like this. Only complaint is the Deacceleration response is known existent. Would like to see better tire grip physics, and gearing response changes. Right now it feels like every gear is ice with the higher gears being the iciest off limits. The brakes don't feel very confident I find my self guessing if they will do the job or I have to much speed for them to and understeer. The boost effects and engine responses are spot on though.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HandsUpGunsDown/recommended/412880/","HandsUpGunsDown","Juan Chino","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HandsUpGunsDown/","175 products in account","This game is pure value. At only 7 euro, you get a fun, addictive and highly replayable game that is being constantly updated by the developers, at the time of this review, supporting even steering wheels with pedals. I've tried Logitech 920 and the feedback works just fine, the throttle has enough sensitivity, the steering is on point and the overall experience works very well. Also, for controller guys, the game allows the option to connect all kinds of third party PC controllers, as well as Microsoft's Xbox 360 controller. You will most likely not need a top notch PC for this game, as the Unity engine graphics keep it simple and the overall gameplay is not too sollicitating for your machine, so anyone can enjoy it. The develpoers are continuously updating the game's graphics and textures to work and look better, so no worries about that. The game itself is rather simple, consisting of car tuning and drifting it on 5 circuits at this time. Fortunately, the tuning is in depth, allowing you to swap engines and upgrade its components, such as the block, the turbo and the NOS efficiency. The gameplay is fairly simple, consisting of starting drifts in an aracadey manner then sliding continuously in order not to lose your combo. Some tracks actually require perfect throttle control to be able to keep the skid going, offering the game a certain skill-cap and keeping it challenging. The Multiplayer mode is a great chance if you want to practice tandems or simply have some fun with your friends, as well as meet new drifters. Aside from the scripters, trolls and bug exploiters which may sometimes appear on the server, the community is quite alright and it is unlikely you will run into any issues aside from the occasional server lag. Overall, even though the game feels a tad too much like an early access title due to its lack of content, its replayability and constant updates make up for this issue and offer the buyer an addictive and fun drifting experience. I highly recommend this game, as it is one of the better cheap and fun titles you can drop a few bucks and spend a few hours on. You won't regret buying this title.","January 11","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It needs more body mods other than camber, and the paint only has one option of metallic.\nI think these can be fixed in a few small patches which isnt bad due to updates being released every two day.

Purchased it on a whim when it was on sale. And to be honest, it is a lot of fun. The mechanics are a little buggy, and the updates take awhile to come out. But behind that, is a great drifting game. You can throw some of your favorite JDM cars around corners at ridiculous angles. And people are always online (at least in my area), and they are all pretty friendly. Not a whole lot of trolls. I would say, if you want to support the dev (single developer) and be in it for the long haul. This game is worth the purchase. If you don't want to deal with broken states, and buggy updates. This game may not be your cup of tea. I'm looking forward to all that's to come, and will continue to put more hours into this game.","April 2","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For example the Toyota Mark II).\nThe track selection is also quite good. From smaller tracks with tight corners to 30kms of Touge mountain roads you have some great tracks in there. If those aren't enough for you, you can also add some mods that you can find on the forums. Or you build a track with the built-in track builder.\n\nI think it's a good game for when you're bored and need to kill some time.
