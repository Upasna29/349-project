"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/recommended/13500/","taylort210","Wagglesworth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/","3060 products in account","Of the Sands of Time trilogy, Warrior Within is easily the most controversial of the bunch. Forgoing the whimsical Nights of Arabia theme of the much beloved Sands of Time, Warrior Within employs a much darker tone, replacing melodic instrumentals with blood pumping metal music, and an emperor’s majestic castle with that of some dreadful thing from a metal album cover. Gone, too, is the storybook hero known only as the Prince, who is now a curse spewing, murder loving psychopath, easy to anger and eager to slice open stomachs. Understandably, not all took a liking to the new Prince of Persia, and many either wrote it off or gave up after dying in the first 10 minutes, all while cursing the monsters at Ubisoft who would dare slight their beloved franchise so vehemently. I am ashamed to admit that while I did not join in the publisher bashing those many years prior, I did assume the many fans’ angers as legitimate. After having neglected the franchise for many years since the original, I have finally played through the trilogy’s entirety. Lo and behold, my judgment is thus: Warrior Within is the best of the Prince of Persia trilogy, and one of the most challenging and equally frustrating and rewarding titles I have ever had the pleasure of besting.\n\nWhere its predecessor, The Sands of Time, relied on linear level progression, a typically gradually increasing difficulty, and relatively basic (and easy) combat, Warrior Within features a (sort of) open world, varied weapons of combat, and enemies that will break your face if you’re not perfect. It also features a higher emphasis on combat than its predecessor, and some of the most frustrating puzzle and enemy design than any other game I’ve played in years. But understand what I mean by that. Warrior Within, for the entire duration, never held my hand. The moment I felt I had a handle on how to deal with an enemy type, a brand new exploding, near unavoidable dog animal thing would be introduced. Obviously, it wasn’t always an exploding dog thing, but you get the point. WW is never easy or gradual in its difficulty. It’s not typically fair, either, but it also never felt impossible, and that’s what made it fantastic. For comparison, while playing Demon’s Souls, I always felt in control of what I was doing, and typically only died if I was quick to run into a room before checking for barriers to hide behind, traps or tricky enemies in the shadows. WW will put you in a room and deal death unto you until you learn to deal with it, and the experience became infinitely rewarding upon besting said situations.\n\nPuzzles don’t quite follow the same degree of difficulty that the combat does, but the challenge comes in unintended traversal. By puzzles, I refer to the Prince of Persia’s method of travel; running along walls, sliding down ropes and hanging banners, and avoiding the many, many spikes and saw blades inexplicably sticking out of walls. The open world aspect of Warrior Within allows you to re-visit any portion of the island that you’ve previously visited, and you don’t necessarily have to follow the same paths. However, the design of these pathways are sometimes altered by the game’s events, and even when they aren’t, traversal in any way different from the standard is a challenge in and of itself, as the developers clearly did not design these paths to be easily followed backwards (or forwards, for that matter), as you will have to do. Worse yet, enemy spawns remain, especially those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dogs I mentioned previously, the ones that can take half of your health. If this sounds frustrating to you, it should. But by the point you should even be considering doing anything like this, you will have already become invested in beating down this seemingly personal hell that the developers have created just for you.\n\nI won’t divulge any of my secrets for passing through Warrior Within, and quite frankly, I would recommend any and all to refrain from guides as much as possible throughout (except for the collectibles, you’ll need a guide for those). Warrior Within is a truly brutal and often unfair achievement in sadistic game design. It’s also one of my most satisfying completions in the entirety of my gaming career. Nearly every instance of combat in this title will chew on your face and kick you in your ♥♥♥ until you really learn to play it. The learning curve can be steep and unfair, and you will want to quit. Don’t. There are no tricks to Warrior Within, and only your skill, and hopefully a share of dumb luck, will see you succeed. What faults it has, of which there are plenty, only add to the experience.","July 5, 2014","true","14.1"," 81 of 88 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","81","88","3","6"

This time it's a whole lot different kind of adventure. No more fancy palace and no more romance in the air. This game tells you a different story.\n\nPrince of Persia: Warrior Within is an excellent game that reveals its greatness as you progress. It starts off a bit run of mill with our moody hero slicing up bad guys, but things take a turn for the best when you get to the island. From here on it's a mind bending challenge after mind bending challenge - each more well thought out and engrossing than the last.\n\nThe graphics are very dark and atmospheric and the gameplay is great too. The Prince feels nice to control as he runs across walls, swings on poles and does tons of cool acrobatic tricks.\n\nThey made some huge changes to the fighting system. Now there are lots of combos and even enviormental kills. Now you can grab and throw enemies off ledges and over them.\n\nThe voice acting seems worse to me.  Especially because Yuri Lowenthal's voice is gone.\n\nThe music is very different from the first game. This time it's all rock and metal, which I didn't really like. Because I'm not a fan of such. But it was necessary. The game forces you to run away from an dark, terrifying guardian of time named Dahaka. And the music is chosen well for this part of the game.\n\nThe game looks and feels awesome. The plot is a sick sticky web that makes you think fast and act faster. New powers and weapons are always nice to see in a game. And trust me, there are a lot of weapons here. Especially because the Prince can now Dual Wield.\n\nLots of secret areas, just like the first game. And some awesome hidden weapons too. You'll have to stray off course in order to find them.\n\nPrince of Persia: Warrior Within is a challenging and fun game. It requires brawn, brains and an appreciation of wicked looking island. It doesn't beat the first game, but still...\n\n\n\n10/10","January 21, 2014","true","9.5"," 51 of 54 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","51","54","0","0"

It makes for challenging and continuously engaging fight sequences broken up by exploring reliably beautiful environments. I can recommend Warrior Within because the combat in it's predecessor was in dire need of refinement and this game meets those needs thoroughly. However, I want to know exactly what was going through Ubisoft's collective heads when they thought changing the light hearted, funny, and romantic tone of The Sands of Time to the angry and serious tone in Warrior Within was a good idea. If you enjoyed the characterization and storytelling from the first game then you'll be sad to hear that neither of which make any sort of return in this game. However, If good combat and thrilling visuals sells it to you, then Warrior Within is certainly worth a look.","December 23, 2013","true","1.8"," 49 of 55 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","49","55","0","0"

It's kinda misleading, and that's why I wanted to start with the fact, that I've played this game on the PS2 since I was a kid, and I still play till this day because I love it so much.\nI will just start with the finishing line. I DO recommend this game to ANYONE who is a fan of the Prince of Persia series. IMO this is actually the best one in the whole franchise. It has everything - the prince's acrobatic capabilities (parkour, if you wanna call it like that), loads of fighting/combat combo's, a huge amount of different enemies to face during the whole gameplay, amazing sites and the list could go on forever. Personally I just love this franchise, that's why I'm recommending this game, but this game is just suited for anyone. There are so many puzzles to solve during the game for those seeking some "brain using" gameplay, and so many secrets to reveal about the prince himself.\nWell of course I should also mention about the soundtrack, which is amazing as well (DUH). They really nailed it by using some really nice metal music (especially Godsmack's tracks).\n20 Empresses out of 10, best game of the decennia.\n\nEDIT: After playing it on the PC for a bit, I noticed quite late that the resolution is square, and you have black lines on the sides(YES, that's how much I got into the game, that didn't even notice those lines). There is actually some kind of mod, that you can find in the steam discussions, which helps you put your own resolution, but it's not flawless as well. Nothing relevant will be lost during the gameplay, but you'll get used to it soon.","August 28, 2015","true","7.2"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","17","17","0","4"

The glitches usually consist of sometimes buggy as hell parkouring, I.E. I go to the very edge of a beam, jump, and end up hover glitching over the end of the other beam, either barely making it, or falling to my death. Then theres some random sound glitches, well at least the glitches in general are sometimes worth a laugh.\n\nThis sequel has an incredibly emo tone, a ton of new combat moves and combos, a switchable secondary weapon which has durability and can be thrown, a bunch of new enemies, and an evil OCD demon 10 times scarier than Nemesis from Resident Evil 3 that chases you down and wants you dead. Its usually a parkour chase when you encounter him, avoid him and parkour correctly, or die horribly. He's not fond of water, so a chase usually ends past a waterfall or something similar.\n\nAlso, there are some hidden unbreakable secret secondary weapons in some areas, like a Rayman glove you can slap everything to death with? Or a flamingo that probably came from that weird TV show that was in Max Payne.\n\nThen theres the Water Sword, a secret primary weapon you can get near the end of the game by doing some akward backtracking and whatnot (this games equivalent of the Master Sword, except optional), and also you need to have found every life upgrade to get it. It also unlocks the game's true boss/ending as well in which you smack a certain nemesis to death with said sword.\n\nSo if you liked the first game, and don't mind some hilarious glitches and incredibly annoying dog demons that explode, give this a try.","October 15, 2014","true","9.3"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","1"

The mix of parkour and combat is very well done and it feels so good to slow mo chop an enemies head off.  The story line in my opinion is pretty ok but nothing that will bring tears to your eyes because it is so great. The dark appearance and music does a good job of setting a mood of suspence and danger, as if you are being chased (which you are). There are many secrets that with some effort you can find adding a nice little alternitive than just following the main plot all the way. There are many weapons to find and because The Prince is now wielding two weapons there are some nice combos to be had. The controls are also fluent and well done. However just becasue you are fighting doesnt mean that you just hack and slash your way through, there are many interesting puzzles that add a great element to the game. The game also has decent graphics but you must remember this game is from around 2004 so it is not what you are used to in todays games. Overall this game is VERY FUN and what really does it for me is the great combat, puzzle and parkour mixture. 9/10","July 1, 2014","true","10.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But having beat it now, I look back, I actually kinda maybe  ♥♥♥♥ing hated playing this game.\nok i have finished sands of time and i have played a little forgotten sands. warrior within, definitely the worst.\nIts better than sands of time in the aspect that the combat has gotten a little better (still pretty similar, except you don't need to absorb people anymore cause you don't have the dagger of time).\n\nBut your overall experience is impedied by the\n-unfairness of the combat (if you fall to the floor, enemies can still repeatedly hurt you making it impossible to get up).\n- getting sands is much rarier in this game\n- UNBELIEVABLY repeatative, like the game is pretty long already without having to go back through places 3 times for no reason. seriously Prince has the worst sense of planning, you go to one side of the castle and then have to go all the back like 3 times. and its not like an open map, these are closed rooms and hall ways. and the objective and enemies are the same. exactly the same. it gets excrutiatingly boring.\n- the glitcheness, i don't think this is my computer, if it is then i retract this one. but there were times where i would be running a rope on a wall, and i would just stop and stick to the wall, having to waste a precious sand tank (seriously ♥♥♥♥♥ hard to get) to get off. other glitches happened as well, especially annoying when fighting, but it is an old game, and it didn't happen too frequently.\n\nand im sure there are other things that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off about this game, but seriously, its late, i just finished the game and i got uni tomorrow or should i say later today. so onto the confusing things.\n\nlike any game, movie, comic, manga, book, etc. when time travel is included, plot holes are created. warrior within is pretty solid none the less.\nAnother confusing point, the emo'ish half/skantly/wearingnothingbutblackbraandpanties women that attack you.... is it really necessary for them to moan and scream in plessure and talk about pleasure and many sexual things as they stab you repeatedly, i mean come on, mixed signals. and they mount your back as well, and your like hell yea, but then they stab you. like way to lead the Prince on. But seriously, people in rooms next to me might get the wrong idea, i mean my porn doesn't have any pain fetish in it at all!\nand it is soo out of place, like there are giant monsters and then these half naked ladies getting off on killing you. like did the empress of time when hiring these people be like... hmm yea i kinda like the giant armored monsters, lets just have 2 or 3 of these guys... but lets blow our how employment budget on these stripper demons.\nmaybe Prince walked into the wrong castle, he actually walked into a big ♥♥♥ brothel, i mean that would have been a great twist end.\n\nIm gonna put this as a recommend anyway, cause the prince of persia is a good series, and i have had some fun. if there are others like me just playing through the series, you gotta get past this one anyway. the combat was pretty cool at times, cool acrobatic ♥♥♥♥.\n\n\nBut sands of times was better.","April 9, 2014","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story continues seven years after the events in the Sands of Time with the Prince of Persia as he sets out to find the Empress who created the sands... of time. His goal is to stop her and change his fate. In the first game, after stabbing the hourglass with the Dagger of Time, the Prince had released the Sands and changed the timeline. Due to this, he has been constantly hunted down by the Dahaka, an inevitable being of fate which, by killing the Prince, could correct the timeline and the Prince's fate. That is why the Prince embarks to the Island of Time to confront the Empress, to change his fate permanently.\n\nOne of the more notable aspects of Warrior Within is how violent it is. The tone is much dark than it's predecessor and even the levels are grimier. But the platforming, bar hopping, ledge jumping, wall running, etc; it's all still there. And still just as fun. But what's even more notable about this game is the element of time travel. The plot gets really interesting about 3/4ths of the way through when various mysteries are uncovered and pieces are put together by the prince. His development and keen insight were a joy to watch throughout.\n\nOne last thing, make sure you get all nine life upgrades to get the water sword for the alternate ending, which in reality is the canonical ending that continues into The Two Thrones. Plus it's so much more rewarding than the regular ending.\n\nAnyway, great game, but my only major complaint might be the drastic changes in music, from the Middle-eastern styled orchestral to the guitar driven metal. Not a fan of the metal use in this game. Oh, and I guess more PC options would have been nice. A few bugs. No other complaints really.\n\n9.1/10","August 8, 2015","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think this game upped the difficulty, which was essential after the Sands of Times which was a little easy at times. However, I do think the game took a few step backs from the Sands of Time. The first being the tone, I personally felt the dark tone of the game was completely unnecessary and the game could of easily gotten away with a lighter tone. Also, I find the change of the Prince’s voice completely off-putting. I have no idea why they changed it but it was the completely wrong decision. Also, his personality was a little too extreme at times. I could not imagine the SOT calling anyone a ‘♥♥♥♥♥’. Yes, it’s meant to be years later and this and that happened. Though the developer chose to make all that happen to make him ‘dark and edgy’ in the first place, I’d rather them of not.

I played the entire series back in the day and recently purchased them again while they were on sale. The graphics are obviously dated but what do you expect it's and old game, the problem lies with the rest of the game.  The soundtrack in my opinnion doesn't really do anything besides prevent awkward silence (which there is still a lot of) and personally I don't think the music really fits the game. The gameplay is alright, the game itself can be enjoyable but the plot isn't really that great compaired to the other games.\n\nThe major problem with the plot is that if you jump from the first game Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time to this you won't really know what's going on, from my understanding this game continues off of a side game created for the ds. That's a pretty bad idea in my oppinion, but after a short while you understand what's going on but will most likely wish there was some more detail on what happened inbetween the two games. But I do give the game a little bit of props for having a little replayability by having an alternative ending. The alternative ending is what leads to the beginning of The Two Thrones so I do reccomend getting all the life upgrades.\n\nThe game suffers through a few annoyences, for example throughout the playthrough you will probably notice that they try and make the game seem badass in every aspect.  Notably music by Godsmack, and a first boss featuring armour that hardly protects her buttcrack. Honestly I think most of the things they put in the game to try and make it "cool" just took away from the overall gameplay. But what can I say at least the combat was fun and I always like climbing things, so although it's very far from perfect I reccomend this game but only if you play through the Sand of Time. And if you enjoy the Sands of Time and think this is to stupid so you don't want to try the Two Thrones I will say you should change your oppinion as the Two Thrones is a TON better than this one.","March 2, 2014","true","3.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

One of the greatest of all time.\n\nThe story is really nice, it keeps a strong connection with the first one, while it can run as a stand-alone story. Really thrilling and original.\n\nThe graphics and the atmosphere made a radical change here. From the charming arab palaces of the first game, we will be now in a cursed island, where everything will try to kill us. We will have to fight using the hundres of combo to get rid of the hordes of monster that will follow us, explore downhearted scenarios and try to survive. The castle is just badass, and the atmosphere is really depressive and sadistic.\n\nThe music is totally awesome. Heavy metal during the fights, depressive dark ambient during the puzzles and exploration stages.\n\nAlso, the game is ultra gore and violent. Be ready to decapitate and cut in two pieces your enemies, using hundreds of different weapons and combos.\n\nA masterpiece. I know some fans were upset because of the radical change from the first game, but really, this game is nuts. Black metal made game.\n\nNo bugs reported on this version, just some people, like it happened to me, will have this file corrupted: Video\Cine\CINE0102.BIK (inside the folder where the game is installed), that makes the game crash after the very first boss battle. The only way to make the game not crash is to replace this file with its uncorrupted version you can find in cd/dvd version of the game, or you can just download it, as legally as you can, from internet.","December 25, 2014","true","16.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Definitely the exact improvement needed.\n\nChange in past-present was as satisfying as ever - cannot recall any other game at that time with such concept.\n\nThe plot is twisted, providing unexpected turns and decisions. At least it was confusing 10 years ago for a 11-year boy.\nA lot of different bosses, each recquiring a different approach - by far, the greatest addition since the previous game.\n\nYou can play the game even if you didn't finish the SOT part.

It's just so infuriatingly glitchy, that you constantly keep dying because the character falls through the map, grabs the air a half meter away from the ledge then falls, etc.\nHowever, the level design, the fights and the atmosphere are so masterfully created that you might be able to live with its many technical shortcomings. For me, the real dealbreaker was the presence of many game-breaking bugs. Basically, these glitches prevented me from proceeding in any direction so after some time I had to quit playing.

By shere luck, it seems. They knew it and released it anyway.\n\nI love the dark setting, Godsmack inspired soundtrack, the cheap but effective idea of playing same level in 2 different timelines. Even the extremely cheesy dialogue.\n\nBut after spending past 2 hours trying to climb down a simple wall in Tower Activation (past), I've had just about enough. I wish I could get a refund but alas, I've spent too much in-game time already.\n\nThis makes me sad as, game-breaking bugs/glitches aside, this would easily be my favorite installment of PoP.

For one, it emphasizes combat far more than the first game while utilizing a fighting system that is more busted than ever; this time the Prince flails around like a stoned acrobat who also happens to be a dead swan, flopping his lanky limbs at everything BUT that which you intend.\n\nThe combat is not the greatest offender, however.  That honor goes to the level design!  Whereas in the first game you joyfully somersaulted once through each well-designed obstacle course before assailing the next unique level, Warrior sees you slogging repeatedly through the same murky, uninspired switch and saw and pole courses, interminably back and forth, back and forth, until either your sanity departs or you do a rage uninstall, which is what I SHOULD have done.\n\nAnd for the crap-flavored icing on the carrion cake, the tone has shifted from cool and easy Arabian Nights-style to grunty grimdark BS.  No longer is the Prince a tough yet somewhat sensitive sort (which jived with his incredible acrobatic ability); now he's just some turd with tribal tats who gruffly tells everyone and everything, including ****ing bats, that he will bloodily DESTROY any and all who stand in the way of his legendary sword arm!  Uhhgh!\n\nThis is garbage, this is trash, this is a poopy old relic that deserves to stay buried forever.  Why did I bother to play through this endless torturefest, acquiring all the life upgrades and getting the "good" ending no less?  Chock it up to a bout of extreme self-loathing.

Combat is still an issue, and having to pick up new weapons after about 10 swings is annoying.  Platforming is better, but you may still jump off into thin air occasionally.  Certain enemies are a bit of a pain, but most aren't too bad.

You have to be a ♥♥♥♥♥ to find this game tasteful. The entire approach of this game is "Lets add tons of Gore, hip music, and make the prince this dark hero with a bad side and all the kids will buy it"\n\nThere are annoying repetitive drum and guitar BGM's that constantly play in the background. The map they give you for the island your on is an outdoor photograph of a castle with "approximate locations" pinned on it, leaving you to roam aimlessly. The platforming is its only saving grace, which is interupted by boring and tedious combat every 5 minutes. There are plenty of good platformers available out there. Dont let this be your introduction to the genre.\n\nYou have to time travel back and forth between past and present to solve platforming puzzles. But dont be fooled, this is not one of the princes abilities. you must haul yourself all the way to a room in the castle and activate a platform to change time. Yup. its frustrating too.\n\nLet me put it this way. This is not the sandy persian adventure your expecting. its a medieval dungeon crawler with tons of gore. avoid this garbage at all costs. If you have your heart set on Prince of Persia, play the 2008 remake or the forgotten sands and its psp counterpart. The 2 original 2D prince of persia's are great as well as the Fallen King for DS and the iOS and Android remakes. Personally i would say avoid all 3 in the sands of time trilogy. But it is Necassary you avoid Warrior Within and Prince of Persia 3D released in 1999, as these are both a disgrace to the intelligence and respect of real gamers.","December 19, 2013","false","4.8"," 6 of 61 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","6","61","0","0"

I own this game for the Playstation 2, & from what I've seen, this version is reletively unchanged.\n\nSo yeah. 2nd game in the prince of persia trilogy, & considered the worst of the 3 for being buggy, having the game being more combat focused, & turning prince into a gruff ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. But, I like these changes. I like the darker tone, I prefer the game being more focused on combat, & I like princes new personality.\n\nStory: 7/10\n\nThe first game had you trying to undo what the prince did: Opening the sands of time with the dagger of time. In this game: the prince is being chased by the unstoppable guardian of time: The Dahaka. The prince is being chased by this creature, because when he opened the sands, he should've died, he however, did not. Because of this, he has disrupted the timeline & must be killed to restore it. The princes job is to somehow change his fate. Okay, pretty interesting. Its not 10/10 5 STARZ, but its not too shabby.\n\nMusic: 9/10\n\nHOLLY SHEET METUL!! Most of this games soundtrack is heavy metal, which I really like! It fits this games darker tone, & they all sound fantastic. The main song of the game is "I stand alone" by Godsmack. an instrumental version of the song plays during certain parts of the game, & the regular version during a few of the games trailers.\n\nGameplay: 6/10\n\nI like the fact that this is more combat focused than the previous game. In sands of time, you didn't have much in the way of combos, you could stab with the dagger, vault over an enemy, or do a 6 hit sword combo. thats it. this game changes that by letting you take enemy weapons & do several flashy looking combo attacks, ranging from simple spinning, to breakdancing & handstands. But the game isn't just combat. Like the previous game, it still has plenty of parkour-esque platforming sequences, & puzzle solving. some puzzles in this game are actually pretty tricky. however, like I mentioned earlier, this game is buggy. like, REALLY. buggy. there are a few that might be patched, but on the ps2, I'd vault over some enemies & teleport across the map, or I'd dodge back & start dancing on a rail (It does look pretty hilarious though.), but most of the time, I'd kill an enemy, as in, theur death animation would play, but they'd still be attacking, I couldn't kill this ghost, it just kept attacking, & as I was in a situation where I had to kill every enemy in the room, I had to reset. Thats another thing: this game uses save points. but at least they're evenly spaced apart, like after a long section, just after a key plot element, or after a Dahaka chase. Speaking of which, thats another element. The Dahaka isn't just a background character, there are certain points in the game where you will have to run from the large black monster as he tries to disintegrate you with his... tentacles...? Uh... Anyway, Running from the dahaka requires you to do a lot of platforming & fleeing, as if you are hit by the Dahaka, its a one hit kill.\n\nControls (Keyboard): 5/10\n\nI had to spend quite a while re-configuring controls to find something I was comftable with, & I'm STILL not comftable with my setup. Its kinda annoying.\n\nControls (Gamepad): 5/10\n\nTo play with a gamepad, you also have to do a LOT of control re-configuration, but it doesn't feel awkward with a gamepad. Unfortunately, you can only use a PS3 gamepad. So if you have no gamepad, or an Xbox gamepad, you're not gonna have a fun time with this game.\n\nOverall: 8/10\n\nGreat gameplay, more combat focused yes, but its something I prefer. Dahaka chases spice things up, & the soundtrack is PHENOMENAL. I would recommend this if you don't mind the platforming to combat change, or if you can get past glitches. If not, at least listen to this game's OST.","March 17, 2015","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, it still is a PoP and overall it's still a "solid" game.\n\nMy main gripes:\n- Combat is pretty decent this time around, much less getting knocked down and not being able to get up again. That being said, fighting multiple opponents can still often be extremely tricky. Single opponents, however, are fodder.\n- The bloody camera. I think this is the one thing that caused me the most deaths in this game. It's very difficult to control and does what it wants sometimes, even invert the controls, despite it not being enabled.\n- Controls are muddy again, the Prince is often not doing what you want him to do. For example, I used a 360 Pad and bound the time button to the left trigger. Well, guess what, that button does not work for the combat time skills, instead I had to rebind the key to another one (left shoulder). Figuring this out was a pain. Another example: Changing direction on a swing pole is left to chance it seems as the Prince sometimes turns and sometimes not. Gladly there are almost no time sensitive jumps in this fashion. You also still need to hold down the action button for all those things to work. Another example: Holding down the direction button to move the Prince forwards does not always result in him going forward, because the game takes the bloody camera angle into account, so instead of just pushing forward on the stick to move a rotating lever, you have to also rotate your stick to move it...*sigh*\n\nAnd my main gripe with the game: The god damn back tracking. I needed 15 hours on easy with a guide to complete this one, I visited some areas 3 or 4 times due to story reasons. You'd better memorize all the areas (in the past and present zones nonetheless) or use a guide. I shudder taking a break for a week or a month from this, coming back and realizing that I have no clue whatsoever where to go and how to get there. The game is an enigma. While it does have a "map", it's absolutely useless, as it's just an "overworld map" and offers NO details whatsoever. Infuriating.\n\nAnother gripe: The last portion of the game is, again, just back tracking and repetition, but also extremely trivial. There is almost no way to fail at that stage and combat becomes extremely simplistic.\n\nWhat does it do well then? Well, it's still fun swinging around, the story is interesting and the past/present mechanic is pretty neat. However, the game needed to be streamlined. The last part is for the most part easy to navigate, but the rest? A nightmare. If you want to find all the secrets, prepare to spend even more time with it. Imho it's partially better than Sands of Time, but Forgotten Sands still beats it in terms of accessibility. Warrior Within is hardcore even on easy...","February 25","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
