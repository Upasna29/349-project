Our two friends, Mike and Isabella, are searching for a lost treasure when family matters from Isabella are happening. After her great-aunt died after a burglar searched for something, Isabella will learn what happened to her grandmother and grandfather, their lives before, during and after the Spanish Civil War in the thirties...\n\nThe story is very great as you're alternating between the present and the past, and several countries: Spain, Russia, Mexico...\n\nAs the game is belonging to the era of list of items on list of items, it could bore easily new players, however, the story is strong enough to make you want to finish it. Besides, there are some interesting minigames. Also, the graphics are also very good, the story being told in comic style but the scenes are a little more realistic. The soundtrack is also very strong.\n\nIf you don't have it, for me, it's a must-have.","August 7, 2011","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Ultimately I completed the levels and embraced the challange I faced.  It was well worth the cost for the hours of enjoyment I received.","October 18, 2015","true","149.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
