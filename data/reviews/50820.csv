It's a fun platformer where you have to use the mouse (your magic marker) to draw in missing platforms to help Max run through the level.  No shooting, no violence whatsoever, except that you can kill the purple meanies by hitting them with your magic marker created platforms and they disappear in a cloud of smoke, almost.  The game makes good use of simple gravity physics.  I found it to be a great fun challenge for my 4 year old.  We had fun playing together.","August 31, 2011","true","105.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It puts creativity and fun together in a way that makes this game hard to put down. You are max who is a kid who draws his world and in his drawings he encounters enemies and obstacles that can be over come with his "magic marker". You solve puzzle and overcome the enemies that come in your way with the marker. The puzzles are not hard but when you get good at them there is a little something extra for finishing the puzzle in record time. There are things to find and places to explore in this game. Its a great casual game that should be picked up if ever you have the chance to. Its fun and has very good rhythm with the music and the flow of the levels. The graphic creativity between sketch and cartoon make this a truly unique game. I really loved playing this game, it was awesome and just put a smile on my face while playing it.","October 15, 2011","true","5.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The platforming aspects are pretty simplistic and you don't really have to be all that creative with object drawings so I ended up just drawing the same squares and lines to progress past obstacles which made it feel boring and repetitive. Overall it's not that bad, but not that good either. Probably a good game for older kids due to some complex puzzle solving.","January 6, 2014","false","4.0"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

(for the most part you just draw lines to jump on)\n. i liked the colour pallet, character designs and animation but they clearly set a light fun child friendly mood\n. basic plot (spoiler alert, max gets a magic marker -.- )","June 22, 2015","true","35.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lzo/recommended/50820/","lzo","Echoes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lzo/","1047 products in account","Designed for kids, Max & the Magic Marker is a mess.\n\nFirst of all, a game designed for kids has to control flawlessly. Good luck with that, the game has a noticeable input lag from the beginning, this would turn even the most forgiving child crazy. Add some inaccurate physics to the mix for the messy recipe.\n\nSecondly, the levels are so simple and bland, the Magic Marker is nothing more than a gimmick, most of the time you are supposed to do what the developers thought it would be the ideal solution, so no creativity rewards. Draw what you want, it won't work 90% of the time.\n\nHonorable mentions to the repetitive and horrible music, which cannot be turned off.\n\nIf my parents had bought me this game as a kid, I would have thought that they wanted to punish me.","September 8, 2014","false","1.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","4","8","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/50820/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1773 products in account","Max & the Magic Marker is a children's game. The game play, platforming, and mechanics are simple and easy enough for a child to master in not very much time. The mechanic of drawing objects is implemented in a much better fashion in comparison to Crayon Physics Deluxe, for example, but that is still far from a compliment. The music is good, and fitting of the game world, but it does repeat quite often. The overall level design is bland, repetitive, and uninspired. The checkpoints are available throughout each level, and they are put to use for the benefit of the player, and not because of difficulty. Because of the game's overall limitation, it is better suited for short play times, as it does get boring very fast. Soon after progressing to the second world, the game has severe crashing to desktop problems with no errors. It simply quits the game and puts you back into the desktop. Other users have had the same exact problem and you can read further about it in the Steam forums. The developers have stayed silent about this game breaking issue, and have not responded in any way, nor corrected the problem with a patch. With an already extremely limited amount of content and bleak game play, Max & the Magic Marker feels more like an attempt at making large amounts of money than actual care and attention to game craftsmanship. The asking price for this game is pure insanity. Do not feed their greed and achingly poor game design and programming.\n\nMax and the Magic Marker is bad.","March 20, 2014","false","1.7"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"
