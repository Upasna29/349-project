The music is really catchy. I've ran into a couple bugs, but nothing major and I've let the devs know about them so they should be fixed soon. The drawings are really nice and they have cheeky little animations once you fill them in.\n\n9.9/10","April 13","true","17.1"," 95 of 113 people (84%) found this review helpful 73 people found this review funny","84","95","113","73","4"

If he's improving this side, I will likely change the thumb down in thumb up, even if it's still not what I was expecting from the game. At least, it would be a little feature that will make the game a little more interesting.\n\nRECOMMENDED ONLY IF YOU'RE SEARCHING A COLORING BOOK - FOR PEOPLE SEARCHING A DIGITAL EDUCATIONAL TOOL OR FOR PEOPLE SEARCHING MORE INTERACTIVITY, PASS YOUR TURN\n\nSteam is opening itself to other customers and I can see that many educational games are also sold on it. While it's true that the platform isn't for all ages, parents are using their account to buy them and generally, they're keeping an eye on what the kid is doing. For a so young audience, I can point to It's Spring Again and Big Thinkers Kindergarten.\n\nWhat's Discovering Colors - Animals?\n\nIt's a coloring "interactive" book. Indeed, the kid choose an animal, colors it with the pencils proposed and when they're done, an animation is triggered either automatically or manually - depending on the current mode.\n\nIndeed, you can find three modes: coloring, free and painting. Sorry if it's not corresponding to the real English words but I've played it in French.\n\nColoring: Each image part has a color tag. The kid takes the pencil with the same color and clicks on the element. If they're wrong, they'll see it visually. When they're done, the animation is beginning automatically. This mode is the only one that can unlock four new drawings.\nFree: The kid is in front of an empty animal. They're free to choose any color they want among those proposed. Like in the previous mode, if they click on a element, it will be colored. This mode allows the child to trigger the animation at any moment.\nPainting: It's similar to the previous mode, apart that the child is coloring the drawing as if they have real pencils. There is no more automatic coloring and no animation can be triggered.\nIt means that if the kid begins with Painting, they can let their imagination run wild and then compare with the vision of the developers through Coloring.\n\nBut these creations can't be exported. If you want a trace of them, you need to take a screenshot (as advised in the info menu). If you don't, when exiting the drawing, everything will disappear.\n\nThere is also an editor where the kid can draw what they want, with all the pencils unlocked. Again, you can't save his creation. You need to take a screenshot (Steam allows you to take screenshots easily, luckily).\n\nWhat is kinda misleading is the title: you could image that there is text, audio said by a voice actor, with the animal and some details or the colors themselves as there is many nuances of blue, brown, grey. In reality, there is none of that. The adult is the one that needs to explain everything, even if he had problems to recognize colors (for example, there is a color that I can't classify as it could a light brown or a grey). The animals are easy to recognize though I'm wondering why there is an alien in them. But it's disappointing to have only a simple coloring game, without stuff that would say that it's better than a paper coloring book. When you think it's translated in French, it's just disappointing for me to have a digital tool in the language, that may be interesting for the classroom and that you can't make a real use of it, as it's not bringing the educational little stuff in more to say that it could be more interesting than a paper.\n\nI'm not against the adult explaining and answering to the questions, as I prefer a guiding parent when playing, however, like I've pointed it out, you may have people struggling to distinguish enough the colors.\n\nThere is here a missed opportunity to make the PC/Mac version more adapted to the devices. Indeed, it's a simple port of an iOS application. While it's perhaps more fun to use the finger for coloring, the game is too simple and sober. You could have imagined that the animation is telling a little story for example. Or also, little facts about the animals or the colors could have been fun for children.\n\nDiscovering Colors isn't expensive and can amuse a child. However, you can spend also your money on a paper coloring book and do the same activities with your kid. It's missing the little feature that would made it much more interesting for me. It's true that I'm probably more critical because of my work but I was really expecting a real nice discovery of animals and colors. I've a little cousin that has a book with animal and while there is no text, just pictures, it's also an audiobook, with the animal's screams. With a digital product, you can make more than a simple coloring book.\n\nThis is why I'm putting a thumb down for it. It would have been more interactive, I would have thumb it up. But this simple port missed an opportunity. However, for those wanting just a coloring book, you can go ahead without problem,","April 14","false","0.9"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Though he can't use a mouse properly, he loves the colors and the animations when completeing a picture.  I actually found myself playing it for a bit after he went off to do something else.  If you have kids, this is a great game and at $2 it's actually cheaper than a coloring book.  You also unlock more pictures as you play, though I'm not sure how many there are total, but I'm expecting to get a lot of time out of this.","May 2","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are three modes of coloring that can be selected: Color coded filli-in-the-spaces, free color filli-in-the-spaces, and free draw mode. Each animal has a little animation that can be played once the picture is completely filled in.\n\nI have to say I'm dissapointed in a couple things, the biggest one being lack of color selection on most animals. The game only gives you four or five colors that corresponds to each animal and the environment that its in. I feel like this is too restrictive, and I found myself wanting the full color selection to do wacky color combinations.  Another thing is that the animations aren't much to speak about. They're mostly just flowers waving in a breeze or moving waves. The butterfly doesnt even flap its wings, and I was pretty let down by that.\n\noverall, I rate it a thorough and immersive gaming experience. 420/69 dewrito points.","April 19","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"
