It's not much of a true RTS, it's more like a little bit of an economical base building, in which you will build buildings that are huge and you can walk in third person through your base, which is great!\n\nThe races feel extremly different and are all fun to play.\n\nThe maps are all well thought out and have you take a different approach to them.\n\nThe graphics of course are incredibly dated, but hey, it runs on every potatoe now!\n\nThe RPG elements are not that huge, but you can definetly customize your character to your liking. The spells are really creative, especially the mental magic ones. Just try them out in free play!\n\nYou can sink hours upon hours into this game.

Most of the game revolves around your hero, who is a ''Rune Warrior'', and has the ability to activate different types of monuments and such, which are able to summon Avatars, who are weaker heroes, but a force to be reckoned, especially in RPG maps. You're also able to activate monuments of different races, which are able to summon a specific race's workers or warriors(presuming you meet the requirements). Summoning workers or Avatars also consumes\nyour rune power, which determines the rate at which the workers or Avatars are summoned, and recovers slowly. Now, for the RTS part, it is combined with the RPG part, as you need to find blueprints to be able to build more advanced buildings or units, and you must also find worker runes to increase the power of your units. The game has 3 lenghty campaigns, and a free play mode. As for me, I'm playing the free play mode currently, where you have free choice of what map you play, or what race you play.\nPros : +Lenghty campaign\n+Well-done hybrid of RTS and RPG\n+Half-naked women in loading screens\n+Plenty of hero customization\nCons : -Somewhat bad translation\n-Spells require you to find a higher level scroll to level up\n-Walking from one part of the map to another can get tiring at times\n[8.5/10]","September 20, 2014","true","56.0"," 45 of 49 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","45","49","0","0"

And you know what? So is the core play of the game. There's a lot of innovation here in SpellForce. Although parts of it are rough around the edges, there's too much good gameplay here to pass up.It is neither the best RTS nor the best RPG out there. However, SpellForce offers enough of a quality experience in both genres, packaged in a pretty environment that you could spend dozens of hours exploring as a Warrior of the Rune.There haven't been a lot of games that manage to combine large scale strategy and role-playing together and be successful. Phenomic has made a damn good stab at it with this one though.","April 27, 2014","true","6.8"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","0"

The base building was so refreshing in this game, using Rune monuments as the center for recruitment of armies and workers. Aside from the monuments dedicated to the humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, trolls and dark elves, there are also monuments for heroes that you can customize.\n\nThe way the six nations play out is simply amazing, each nations gathers resources in its own way and have different uses, for example, the humans and dwarves can double their iron income but the elves don’t even have a building for it, they counter this disadvantage with having the ability to build foresters that can rebuild forests and maintain a almost infinite supply of wood. These base building and army recruitment details really enhance the experience for RTS fans.\n\nThe customization of your characters and heroes’ weapons and skills also add to this, there are also a huge variety of weapons, armor and spells to choose from as you go through the game. The way you play the game really rewards you with different situations, I prefer the warrior gameplay but after playing as a mage I did find it more of a challenge to get through the game. To add to this, there’s also a fantastic soundtrack included and beautiful graphics for its age.\n\nAs for downsides, I didn’t find many aside from a few bugs but nothing game breaking.\n\nI really hope that this mix of RTS/RPG returns in the future, anyone who likes fantasy real time strategy games will definitely enjoy this game, I personally count it as one of my favorite strategy games. It’s well worth its price even if you're not that into the RTS genre.","February 18, 2015","true","264.6"," 25 of 25 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","25","25","0","1"

I you want to play, get ready to spend a lot of hours in front of your PC.\n\nThe main game ( The Order of Dawn ) is a great time for new players. You can easily learn the basics of the game enjoying the story which - by the way - is very long and addictive. Even changing the difficulty on HARD, you may "max" your character without unnecessary sweating.\n\nBut the DLC's... That's something else. As for my opinion, the DLC's are for very experienced gamers. Enemies are much stronger even on first world. But, as we know, every medal has a two sides. Behind the hard gamplay is one more, long story line which you will enjoy even more than the main.\n\nIn sum - If you have a lot of free time and you searching for good strategy/RPG, then the SpellForce is the game that you were looking for. I assure, that there is no option that you won't enjoy the gameplay and story. But if somehow you will decide that, the game s*cks, write a message to me, for sure I will change your mind :)","October 31, 2015","true","86.3"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","0"

It is the first game i was more affected and fascinated about doing side quests instead of the main plot (that was absolutely hilarious).

Moving around a map is painfully slow, and every time you re-enter a map, you have to discover it anew.\n\n\nOn the positive side, theres a lenghty campaign (easily 100+ hours, if you plan to finish every quest in the game, which i strongly recommend), including a great and interesting story, different races with unique buildings and units, tons of side quests and stuff to explore, beautiful graphics and sound, great atmosphere, very intuitive controls, a great interface and a lot of fun!\n\nAfter all those hours, i still have plenty to do, lots of motivation and the digital world has really grown on me. Rediscovering known places in order to finish a new side quest, feels like coming home, as i have so many memories about every world.\nI really am getting sad, that SpellForce will come to an end, and that there wont be any more challenges after i beat the game...\n\nI usually dont like and play real-time, but this game is different. I would buy it again any time, and have already purchased the complete second part as well!\nEvery chance to get to play more SpellForce is very welcome!\n\n\nEverybody who likes strategy and role-playing will love this game!","August 4, 2014","true","47.1"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

Spellforce delivers a staggering selection of weaponry, armour, spells, and other miscellanous items - with a fair amount of customization, post-character creation. Spellforce IS a well scripted game, but unfortunately suffers in the voiced audio department (as each and every character in the game seems to speak in a perpetually monotone voice with major lack of expressions and tone), and if that doesn't turn you away (as it shouldn't), Spellforce delivers on all fronts as a polished, refined, and exceptionally well-crafted product.

The main campaign is lengthy, getting through it took me about 90 hours, the story is quite fascinating as well. The RPG part of game is well developed, there are lots of side quests that make exploration rewarding and encourage you to step away from the main storyline. Apart from the main character, you also control up to five different heroes. The RTS part is also cleverly designed - an army is tied to the monument of the respective race, which also provides you workers to build a base. The number of structures of each race is quite big and there is room for customization, as you acquire building and unit plans through exploration usually tied to the main storyline but at times leading you to places you would never think of checking out. The fact that the main character is a rune warrior possessing worker and hero runes also makes the RTS part slightly more believable than usual.\n\nThe game highly favours a warrior type of character (such a character is, at times, even able to solo entire areas) and you might find yourself struggling if you decide to play a mage. Nevertheless, there is a variety of interesting spells and magic branches for you to explore, inviting those who demand a bit of a bigger challenge to choose their own path. Your small party of heroes can potentially be more efficient and less time consuming than an army and one could argue that base building seems pointless at times, but that is up to the player to decide.\n\nTo name a few flaws as well, the AI seems to be amazingly stupid at times and the translation isn't that splendid - there are a few spelling mistakes and some inconsistency, an example being the area Frost Marshes, which is referred to in the game with three different names. Despite its flaws, the game is well worth checking out. If you're looking for a more simplified and friendlier experience, you might prefer the sequel, but I would definitely recommend this game to any fan of either genre. The platinum edition also contains two long and challenging expansions, which, in my opinion, makes it more than worth the price.","December 28, 2014","true","127.3"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

Each combat set has an average of three skills per set, some have more and some have less.\nTo create a character you can choose to be a man or a woman and chose from a set of heads, aswell as your starting skill and stats, each skill requires a different set of stat(s) to level it up.\nThere are three campaigns, the Order of Dawn campaign (simply called "Campaign") which you play as the Phoenix Bearer (although at the time he doesn't know it)\nThe second campaign is the Breath of Winter you play as again a Rune Warrior who later in the game has a weapon called the "Shadow Blade".\nIn the third and fourth campaigns you can import a character from the Order of Dawn or Breath of Winter campaigns (asuming you finished them) there are two campaigns, you get a different character based on what campaign you did before, in the Order of Dawn you get the Phoenix campaign and in the Breath of Winter you get the Shadow Blade.\nAswell as the four epic campaigns there are two multiplayer modes, Free Game Mode which was added in The Breath of Winter expansion pack which allows you to go through maps that you see in the campaigns, aswell as a few maps made just for Free Mode, you can play solo or with another two friends through LAN and online through the now dead Gamespy server, (although i think some awesome person has made a patch to fix that (hopfuly)), Playing in co-op is more enjoyable than playing by yourself, having buddies to play with has it's pros and cons like being able to have a larger force since each player has their own pop cap and you need to defend more than one base, although this isn't always a problem because in some maps you spawn fairly close to geather, in fact in some maps you spawn right next to each other.\nAswell as the co-op Free Game Mode you can play some PvP style multiplayer which up to two teams of three duel it out and in the Breath of Winter expansion pack you can use characters from Free Game Mode which gain XP and level up from kills made in multiplayer, even if an enemy kills some wildlife, although i havn't played much of PvP so i woulden't know too much about it.\nThere are two kinds of maps in freemode and campaign, there are what are called "RPG" maps which it's just your avatar(s) but even though it says RPG there is still a little RTS in it since you can use other Rune Warriors as i mentioned above up to 5 although they don't level up with you, so you have to do a bit of swapping out for higher level runes, which can be annoying especially when you have to ditch one of your favourite runes for a higher level one.\nThe second type is the "Standard" version which you get shrines (similar to the Hero shrine you summon your Rune Warriors with) to train units, there are 6 types of shrines each with their own slave rune which again doesn't level with your avatar but you find slaves every few levels, there are Humans, Elves, Dwarves for good and Dark Elves, Trolls and Orcs for evil each has different uses for the "standard" resources and uses one of the three "unique" resources, although some of the factions like Dark Elves will use more than one special or standard resource type with their structures, even very basic structures like the woodcutter's house.\nWhen leveling up you get 2 skill points and 5 or 10 attribute points, after creating your character you can unlock up to 8 more skills and skill sets, each skill set requires a different attribute level to be reached (the attribute that you have to level is different for each skill and most to all of them require more than one attribute to be leveled) skills can't be leveled higher than the skill set they are in, be careful what you spend your points on though because if you mess up you can't get your stats or skills back.\nIf you don't like controlling your units like an RTS, don't worry you can take direct control of your Avatar although it is fairly clunky and selecting units can be a pain especially since you can still select your avatar in this mode, and attacking is annoying too, when selecting things there will be icons at the top left bellow your heroes icons showing what they can do, and the icon shows how far away they are from the target, you can also assign control groups to units but that probably won't matter much since you won't be splitting your troops up as much because of the fairly restrictive population cap, and when you do it will be because you are leaving a few troops behind to help defend your base.\nIn campaign enemies can drop loot from quest items to random jumk you can sell, but in free game mode and multiplayer they don't which is especially bad with Free Game Mode. But there is a dedicated marketplace map which sells a few special rune warriors, possibly every rune slave, a few special blueprints and loads of weapons, armour and rings and possibly every type of spell in the game but the worst part of Free Game Mode is trying to get the cash to buy everything.\nCo-op in Free Mode is both harder and more rewarding, unless your really good it's best to stick to solo in Free Mode, also the avatar (who represents you in-game) won't automatically attack enemies unless they attack him/her or he/she is ordered to.\nIn general i reccomend getting this if you are an RTS fan or an RPG fan or both this game is a must have.","January 19, 2014","true","143.7"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

If you can get past the initial weirdness and clunkiness of the game, you are in for a wild ride.\n\nFirst of all, the gameplay feels pretty unique, considering that this type of hybrid game hasn't been done too often. You get your main character who you can skill and develop in a multitude of ways, some, admittedly, more fun and effective than others, and you get the base-building portion. There are six races you play through over the course of the story, all of them fun to play as in their own way. You don't get to choose which race you play at which point in time though, the campaign is a bit rigid in that aspect. No biggie though.\n\nWhile we are at the story, it's nothing too special. It's good. But the game is long.\nHoly HELL is it long. I mean, you can easily spend upwards of 40-50 hours on a single campaign if you haven't played the game before, and it comes with two expansions, which are at least 30 hours long. Each.\n\nAtmospherically speaking, the game has a lot to offer in my opinion. The maps look and feel great, and the soundtrack is AMAZING.\n\nAnd then there is the so-called "Click and Fight-System". It's a really simple thing that makes so much sense and it absolute baffles me that it hasn't become a standard for RTS games. Instead of just issuing orders by clicking the unit and then clicking the enemy, you can instead click the enemy and it shows you all possible actions your friendly units can do to it. It's hard to explain without pictures, but if you play and see it, you'll know what I mean. It's efficient, it's intuitive, it's really damn smart.\n\nThe game definitely has some flaws though. It's pretty old by now so the graphics are dated, even though I personally have no problem with that. It has no widescreen support, and forcing it makes the UI weird, so my recommendation is windowed mode.\nAnother flaw is that the game is a bit minimalistic on giving you information and stats about enemies, units and yourself. You get a non-numbered health bar, a non-numbered mana bar, a very brief description of the spells you have, but that's pretty much it. There is no way to know how much armor ANYONE except you has, there is no way to know how much damage one unit will deal to another without trying it out, you don't know anything about the damage, range, duration, effect etc. about the spells you, a friendly unit or an enemy uses, and so on. The best you get is a number above a unit's head that shows how much damage it took.\n\nIf you can deal with that, you're pretty much set. This is a true hidden gem and worth the money. If you see it on sale, consider buying it.\n","January 4","true","164.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

You can be almost everything: form a simple sword fighting warrior to a mage using various spells to destroy his enemies.\nEvery class, like in almost every RPG, requires a different style of play and if you cannot decide which class you prefer you can combinate them.\n\nFrom the start you always have a main quest active which guides you through the story and to the next map. But it is always worth it to leave the main path and look for some side quests which reward you with additional EXP and sometimes with a pretty neat item.\n\nNow to the RTS elements of the game: On almost every map you face a hord of enemies your hero cannot deal with alone. So, you can summon workers at monuments of various tribes (humans, elves, orc, etc.) to gather ressources, build a base and produce units to help you in battle. Every tribe has its own buildings and units, therefore the gameplay with each tribe is slightly different.\n\nOn some maps you can summon up to 5 heros, who can be equiped with items. You can control this heros like your main character. So, instead of building up a whole base you play through the map with just a small group of heros.\n\nIf it comes to a big battle, you quickly lose track of some units (e.g. you heros). For these situations there is a bar at the top of the screen where you can see all important informations and available spells of your heros and get the current position. For different perspectives you can zoom in or out and rotate the map. There is also the possibility to control your hero individually in third-person perspective and via WASD-keys, which is nice to immerse more into the well designed world. But most of the time there is no advantage of this view.\n\nWhat I do not like about the game: Some maps are pretty hard to beat because of huge amount of enemies that are so strong you can only kill them by luring them away from a group and kill them one by one. That takes a lot of time and can be very frustrating, because you have a constant feeling that your character is too low leveled, although you already have done every possible sidequest and gathering a good amount EXP at an enemy spawnpoint takes ages.\n\nConclusion:\nSpellforce is a nice combination of RPG and RTS. The urge to level my hero and to loot more and more items got me at the very first minute. Whenever I got to play with a new tribe I was curious of finding out what its advantages and disadvantages are. The story is nothing special, but it is well told. The design of the maps and units is rich in variety, so you always get something new to see. And if you bring enough time and patience to sit through a hard time completing a map, I would recommend this game.","January 4","true","160.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Auf dieses Spiel kann eine ganze Menge Zeit verwendet werden, da man alle nur erdenklichen Kombinationen bei der Fertigkeitenwahl des Avatars probieren kann. Das Spiel hält dabei nicht nur epische Schlachten gegen Bosse offen, sondern ist sehr vielfältig, da den Spieler diverse Quests (Haupt-, sowie Nebenquests) erwarten, die Aufgaben an sich sehr spannend sind in Bezug zu ihrer Geschichte, aber auch nicht "nur rohe Aufgaben" eingebaut wurden. Die Graphik empfinde ich als sehr angenehm. (Ich bin allerdings auch kein sonderlicher Graphik-Fanatiker. Zudem sollte man das Alter des Spiels berücksichtigen.)\n\nDas für mich Faszinierendste am gesamten Spiel ist und bleibt jedoch die Geschichte, die dahinter steckt. Sie ist sehr spannend und hält den Spieler bei der Rolle. SIe zieht sich zudem durch alle drei Teile von "Spellforce" (das Hauptspiel "The Order of Dawn" und die beiden Erweiterungen "Breath of Winter" und "Shadow of the Phoenix") durch, sodass die Geschichte von Teil zu Teil fortgeführt wird und die Story komplettiert. Es können jedoch alle drei Teile unabhängig gespielt werden, was ich aufgrund der faszinierenden Story nicht empfehle.\nDaher kann ich nur sprichwörtlich sagen: "Das Spiel war und ist jeden einzelnen Penny wert." und kann es jedem nur empfehlen, sofern man etwas für das Genre offen hat.","January 18, 2015","true","191.6"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

It really tried to touch that hybrid frontier of RPG/RTS. I got the Platinum edition on sale, and dove in. Little did i know the hole goes to China. 90% of the time, i prefer long games, makes the experience lasting and fun to view in scope. However, games that i tend to enjoy that last upwards 100 hours usually have meat in them, every minute is either action packed or planning. This game is not one of those games. I dont know how many collective hours i spent READING A BOOK while waiting for characters to travel across the map because of poor quest design and placements of locations. Sadly there is no speed adjustment, and each map you play on can last upwards 3-4 hours, which really emphasizes placing content in the map itself, whereas  you forget a chest that might have something nice inside, you have a 8 minute jog all the way back to it, and then another 8 minutes back to a bindstone or portal. The bindstones are your only salvation to get across some of these huge maps with empty space, but even then they are few and far between. I beat the main campaign lasted about 70 hours, got into the 2nd campaign and almost got to the end. Game crashed, and after getting back in found that the autosave feature apparently decided that 4 hours worth of gameplay wasnt worth saving in between. Ive given up, especially knowing that there are many other games out there that want attention. This isnt some Grand Strategy game that requires patience, its an RTS that either moves too slow or has maps way too big. Maybe when i have nothing else, I'll come back to finish, but 100 hours of the SAME BORING GRIND and all i really want to do is just move on. Spellforce, take a few lessons from Warcraft 3. If your gonna make big maps to trudge around, make them interesting.","June 10, 2014","false","118.6"," 52 of 94 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","52","94","0","0"

It is also long. The story itself happens over a long list of areas, and sub quests will have you going back and forth between areas all the time, and each map can take up to a couple hours if you play like me and amass as big an army as you can before you head out.\nSecond is the actual gameplay of each area. Quite often the overall objective is to destroy the enemy base, or to get to something behind the base, but there will be things along the way like a graveyard off to the side with ghouls that will also attack your base, or a village under siege who will give you resources if you help them. Quite often you will find things you can interact with that you have no idea about only to later find the side quest that takes you there which lead to a lot of exclamations of, "So that's what that was for!"\nSometimes though you will get areas where you have to fight with just your main hero and rune heroes and the dynamic shifts considerably. Suddenly that one powerful healing mage who can aoe heal your army  and keep them going a bit longer, takes a bit more of a backstep and changes spells to join in the action himself with his weapon. I found these segments quite fun as going from the army building action to a map where you only had your heroes made it feel very much like you were an elite force behind enemy lines.\nThe animation doesn't look too bad and my only gripe with the voice acting is that there is only one voice for each gender. But that is a small gripe as i can see why there is only one when there is so much dialogue throughout the story. I haven't done much multiplayer (mostly because I haven't found someone to go do it with since I don't like randoms) but what I have done has been great.\nOverall, Spellforce is probably my favorite RTS because it isn't just an RTS, and it uses the blended elements really well.\nOh, and everything I just said? That's just the first campain. It's the same again for the second and third. Be prepared to spend ages playing this as in order to do the side quests and all the campains will take you a long time. Each campain has a different story and each is as good a story as the last.\nStill reading? Stop, and start playing.

Its unlike your average RTS of just mindless construction and resource gathering. Although the graphics arent super great and the voice acting along with dialouge arent anything special. The game designers have come up with a mix of RPG, storytelling and then RTS. This specific mix keeps me interested in the game and allows a person to sometimes focus on RPG elements rather then hours of hours of mindless RTS'ing. Along with a storyline, (even though its a standard fantasy story) the game at first is easy to play then much later in the  game, it gets much harder. But I found it just the right balance. Not too hard or too easy. Not to mention the many various races one can choose to start RTS'ing for help in defeating the enemy. However, If your character has become powerful enough, in some of the missions your hero along with the other NPC heroes can handle the mission alone without an army of RTS build. A very well thought of mix for this type of genre (RTS) And since this is has 3 games in it, then its 3 times the fun.

I remember beating the order of dawn's campaign years ago and I remember the game being better than it actually is.  I got halfway through the first campaign before I gave up.  Here's a few of my problems.\n\nTranslation errors: namely some of the written dialog was in a language I didn't read, like german or swedish or something\n\nBAD voice actors.  There were a few good ones, but they were few and far between.  The main character's voice was probably the worst of all.  I just turned it off sound after a while.\n\nUpgrading units in the store doesn't upgrade units you've already purchased.  And this game has multiple powerful upgrades which you get later on, so you wind up with a bunch of underpowered units.\n\nTurrets.  ♥♥♥♥ turrets.  There are a lot of the things in the game and you can only MELEE them down, even units with ranged attacks.  There are no siege units.  And you have to manually and REPEATEDLY  order your units to punch the towers to death because they frequently bug out and start attacking nothing.  An associated problem, there are a limited number of units which can attack a building at a time (thanks to the melee thing) so while the towers are killing your units you have a maybe six or seven of units  out of an army of almost a hundred attacking.\n\nAnd the heroes... o lawd the heroes.  These units don't do anything half the time,letting monsters walk right by and attack your workers.  The other half of the time they'll walk right up to boss enemies and get themselves killed,  instead of using their powerful spells and staying at ranged.  They only autocast a few spells, and not the important spells like Heal so you have to manually instruct them to save your army every. single. time.\n\nA lot of the missions seemed poorly designed, being really difficult one moment only to be followed by an easy level.  I think part of the problem was the transfer between factions was the culprit for this, because the level gives you the usual amount of enemies but only lets you use first-tier units to fight against it.  The designers usually give you access to the last faction's entire tech tree late in the mission (in the form of a Monument to spawn units) to help with this problem.  But by the point that those monuments become available its usually too late to matter, because your army needs to be sufficiently large to hold off attacks on your base AND clear the monument AND defend your resource gatherers, which means your army is probably large enough to just win.\n\nAnother problem... you know what, I give up.  I have no clue how I managed to beat this game when I was young, but I don't have the patience now.","May 18, 2015","false","16.9"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

I really thought this would be pretty good. The first person videos are very deceiving and don't really reflect actual gameplay in which you play from a top down perspective. You can play in first person but certainly not as a mage character. If you played this when it came out you could probably enjoy it since you would be used to the terrible controls, graphics and gameplay, but for the newcomer this should be a game you skip. I will be playing spellforce 2 to see if its any improvement.\n\nI played through with a black mage and....wow you are slightly more useful than your average troop. Cast times are long in relation to the damage output you do and mana is scarce even when you max the pool and regen. Spell upgrades are not meaningful and most of the time i am just regular attacking to do the same amount of damage with less micromanagement. One of the most annoying things is there is no hot keys for spells.....you must click the spell and click the unit you want to attack or heal. In crowds of 30-50 units this can be VERY annoying. I imagine the game is a little better playing a melee unit with an attack that scales properly.\n\nTravel is pretty bad due to large maps and one slow run speed. Takes forever to do the boring fetch quests you are given.\n\nResource gathering is so simple and isn't rewarding in any way. Its barely even a restriction in making units or buildings, just a slight chore at the start.\n\nThe story is as cliche as it gets and the voice acting is very very bland. Doesn't bother me much, but it is worth noting.","September 16, 2015","false","21.5"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

The player creates a character at the beginning of the game. This character can acquire skills and spells and gain experience from completed quests and vanquished enemies. Items can be bought from shops, looted from enemies or found in chests in the different maps which can then be used to kit out the player character according to the skills the character possesses. The player also acquires runes which lets the player summon additional characters to assist on some maps and as well as let the player summon in workers which constructs buildings and harvest resources. During the game you also pick up recipes and blueprints which will allow you to create new units and construct new buildings.\n\nThe scope of the game is vast. The main campaign may require more than 50 hours to complete if you intend to pursue side quests. You have the ability to summon armies composed of six different races (Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, Trolls and Dark elves) which each have 9 different units at their disposal. Each race has its own buildings and require different resources. The game features a story line with many side-quests available.\n\nSadly, the game suffers from a myriad of issues. By trying to be too much the game fails at almost everything. First, the game looks extremely dated. The graphics which might have been impressive in 2006 look really hideous today. Other contemporary games such as Warcraft 3 have fared much better. The gameplay is a mess. The ambitious design to combine RTS and RPG elements have resulted in a situation where neither of the systems are particularly satisfying. The RPG part has perhaps been fleshed out more but it never really feels rewarding. The strategy side is a total mess. Your only tactic is essentially to mass powerful units and try to send them toward the enemy in some fashion. Most units if not directly controlled will charge to attack the nearest enemy they can see which causes them to run into enemy encampments and chaos ensues. Trying to micro-control your units in combat is almost futile and if your attack fails, you might just as well just get a new troop of units and try again.\n\nCombat is unsatisfying. You can see how much damage you do to enemies and how much they do to you but you are never given the information how much health, mana, skills, spells or speed they might possess. The lack of information makes it hard to determine how effective units are, Your recruitable units are also very similar. Each race has a basic melee unit, basic archer, magic user. Then more effective melee user and archer and so on. The magic users with their different spells are the most varied. Every other unit just feels like their models got changed and nothing else.\n\nYour enemies will never build structures or gather resources. Instead they are spread out across in the map in pre-build encampments. As long as their buildings stand, new units will get spawned in which will attack your camp. By razing their buildings the spawn points disappear. It's a simple solution but also rather boring. The difficulty of the maps are mostly based on how fast new units spawn and attack. Whenever spawning isn't used the map is usually littered with non-consequential enemies which you have to grind through.\n\nThe game is very slow. Your units and character run at predetermined speeds and often you have to run great distances and criss-cross over a map to finish off all objectives which, frankly, takes ages. Building up your base also takes time and you always have to build the base from scratch on new maps. Acquiring the required resources to produce the necessary units is also a slow process and often I found myself stepping away from the computer and doing chores instead of playing the game. The slow running speeds combined with the dull base-building artificially prolongs the length of the game. By the end I was bored out of my skull, frustrated from assorted bugs and barely managed to muster enough effort complete the main campaign.\n\nI can only with good conscience recommend this game to rpg/rts fans who have a lot of free time on their hands and don't mind lackluster mechanics. Anyone else should avoid Spellforce. Spellforce was purchased based on incorrect teenage nostalgia and a heavily reduced price.","January 28, 2014","false","62.7"," 8 of 25 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","8","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arontimes/recommended/39540/","arontimes","Aron Times","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arontimes/","54 products in account","tl;dr: Don't get this game.\n\nI got this game a while back, about two years ago or so, as part of the Steam Summer Sale of that year. It was advertised as a hybrid RPG/RTS game, and since those are my two favorite genres, I thought it was a good deal. Boy, was I wrong. It turns out that when you try to serve two masters at once, you end up serving neither. This isn't a hybrid RPG/RTS game; it's a mediocre RPG duct taped to a mediocre RTS, resulting in a very boring a repetitive gameplay. Spellcasters in particular are annoying to level up, as you have to collect a spell once at its minimum level and for each level above it. The various stat requirements for combat and magic skills also punishes you for trying to be creative, as choosing skills with mismatched stat requirements will result in you never reaching the maximum level for one or both skills.\n\nGraphics-wise, it has not aged well, as it dates to the time when 3D acceleration was in its infancy, and the graphics look primitive compared to its contemporary 2D or hybrid 2D/3D games. As for the audio, the voice acting is inconsistent. Some of the voice acting is professional, though done by voice actors who aren't native English speakers, which adds a dash of the exotic to the involved characters. The rest is terrible and amateurish, and ruins immersion when heard alongside the decent voice acting.","July 7, 2014","false","10.7"," 3 of 32 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","3","32","0","0"

Most of the RTS components are resource gathering and army upgrade structures while most of the RPG is popping abilties whenever they come off cooldown and equipping a paperdoll. You can get more Hero units to equip and micromanage skills but only your main levels up. Classes are really narrow and if you are unlucky with drops (main town near the beginning only sells low & high level overpriced trash) you will be stuck with a one trick pony who is weaker than your cannon fodder troops.\n\nIn short, this game tries to do too many things and is not greater than the sum of its parts.","January 20, 2011","false","8.8"," 0 of 27 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","27","0","0"

I have good memories with this game. Played it like about... 300 maybe more hours in total (not on steam version just bought it like 2 weeks ago or something) Main quest is not really that "wow" thing but it's kinda interesting like "what is going on right now? I want to know why it's happening!" game is classic, i don't think graphics are so important but if we talk about that... for the time when the game was released... it's just perfect. Gameplay? Sure it's nice, building you're kinda camp/town and then your army or army can be first too just what suits you (Need some buildings for it first tho to get basic fighters) Resources are a tough thing in the first hour of the game, it's kinda slow and the waiting for food to expand your army.. i think if u take your time and like to build some nice towns like me you will need like 3-5hours at one map! Seriously, and we are not even talking about side quests! Some quests are really hard, some are easy as hell - > just destroy them do that and that done. But sometimes you just get tough enemies. Game has 6 races 3 light and 3 dark (sides). Further and further u will get all of them but there aren't so many missions where u can use more than 1-2 races so it's slowly. Favorite race? Jesus, Elfs for sure, bows, healers, ice magic enemy doesn't have a live anymore, freeze them. Cons? After some time it begins to be little boring, walking from end of the map just to click on a grave stone fight a 12 level man when u are 15 already.. isn't fun, mostly it's the same story -> Build army and destroy enemy. But i really recommend this game i bought this already 3 times.. first was just classic game second platinum too but lost cd so i thought i just buy it on steam when it was on sale, totally worth even when it isn't you will have fun i promise!","December 31, 2014","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd love to see a revival of this, or a Spellforce 3 with rune warriors again and similliar mechanics with better graphics etc. Spellforce 2 is just so bad. The tech tree is completely pointless and forces you to hybrid, and not choose skills wisely. Here, in Spellforce 1  you have to choose wisely to not screw up your character. in SP2 it's not the case.

But rather fun and addictive. Best way I can think to describe it is if you took Diablo, added in your standard party based format from RPGs, then blended it with a RTS game. That's not exact. But it might give an idea. Sometimes you're controlling your character (maybe) via  3rd person camera and standard wasd movement controls. More often you're using an isometric top down view and clicking on where you want your character(s) to move to or what you want them to attack. And other times you're building a base camp, fortifying it against attackers, and then building an attack force like you're playing your favorite real time stratagy game.\n\nThe storyline so far is rather interesting. The controls are intuitive. If you've played any RTS games you're going to master the controls easily. And while the stratagies aren't very complex, mostly you're just building up a good sized attack force and steam rolling everything in your way, that's kind of true for most RTS games. There's very few in the genre where a stratagy beyond "create 30 of X type of unit then blitz the enemy" is needed.","November 8, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
