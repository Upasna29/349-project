"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shikono/recommended/219200/","shikono","Elfee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shikono/","382 products in account","Droid Assault is a modern-retro arcade shooter in the typical Puppy Games visual style (other Puppy Games: Titan Attacks, Ultratron).\n\nIn this game you can experience running blaster battles with hordes of rampaging killer robots!\nThe player team can contain up to eight droids at one time. Player control can be quickly transferred to any of the units by hitting the assigned numeric key assigned to the drone, or by launching a transfer beam to a nearby friendly unit. You can hack enemy droids into joining your squad, collect upgrades, choose different droid types and go through the floors, fighting bosses and and and.\n\nThe first few levels are pretty quick but get progressively more challenging…\n\nDroid Assault is constructed for players that crave the adrenaline rush of dodging a searing hail of enemy projectiles. Droid Assault is smart, nerve-wracking, and intense. Worthwhile for when you need some minutes of action.\n\nI really like the game but the original price (9,99 €) is not adequate in my eyes. I advise to wait for a coupon or a sale.\n","July 3, 2014","true","1.7"," 40 of 41 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","40","41","0","7"

Your task is to start out with a small robot and clear enemy ship's levels one by one at same time upgrading yourself by capturing and taking over enemy robots.\n\nThe robots vary with speed, armor and armaments and once you have captured an enemy unit, it then follows you assisting you with clearing the rest of the level. You can then easily switch between your robots while AI controls the rest of your group.\n\nGame is very entertaining, easy to hop in and out, while the difficulty level between levels slowly increases. It gives me nice flashbacks from the old Paradroid game in C64, though Droid Assault is much more action oriented and doesn't require careful planning.\n\nIt's made by Puppygames - of course I recommend it to everyone.\n","September 25, 2014","true","1.7"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","0"

You start with a crap droid and capture others, which in turn act as allies that you can switch to, but act autonomously. Droids themselves can move around and shoot in any direction, with various speeds, weapons and properties. It's really easy to get in to, really hard to master. The checkpoint system is more than fair, though, so you can always head back to a previous checkpoint level to use the squad you had when you last made it to that level, so if you really screw up a run, or are aiming for an achievement ("Flush" is a nightmare), you can slowly push the odds in your favor, as sometimes your AI buddies can march to their deaths when they have multicore brains.\n\nIt plays very well, has local coop and offers gradual challenge jumps to ease you into the more chaotic battles that can occur. Just keep in mind how the checkpoint system works, and you won't end up with a fist through your monitor.","May 17, 2015","true","9.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

Use them to transfer droids under your command. Wreck more droids. Yes there's some tactical considerations but those are mainly important when you're injured or spot a healty droid you'd like to steal. Squad management is minimal, but don't let that fool you into thinking the game is mindless, chaotic and dumb. It's mindless, chaotic and fun!\n\nThe game is simple and short. Hectic to the point of overwhelming chaos, well designed and presented in a 'puppygames' style that is both charming and epileptic. Or 'just right' though your mileage may vary. I personally enjoyed the audio/visual aspect of the game, though it can be irritating or mind-breakingly confusing. I just like that stuff.

One of the most brilliant minds in music once said, "keep it simple stupid" -J.B. (it’s also origin of K.I.S.S.) and the simplicity of Droid Assault is brilliantly done on so many different levels, from its game play, to graphics, to sound. With this title Puppygames does "K.I.S.S." proud.\n\nThe gameplay is too damn fun and it's simple, you're a droid (no, not a phone, a robot) who can take control over other enemy droids to make them friendly or you can just blast them away, friendly or not. Once the level is cleared of all enemies, repeat in the next level. You can literally create your own army of droids, that is, if you do not shoot them. There are a lot of different droids all with different attributes, abilities and weapons to make this game even more fun and interesting, along the way picking up a multitude of different power-ups.\n\nThe graphics are always very well done with Puppygames games and Droid Assault is no exception, as the contemporized old school graphics are very well designed with that Puppygames genuine style that give this game its beautiful unique flare.\n\nThough there is no sound track to this game, which to me is the games only downfall, the atmospheric backgrounds and sound effects are immersive and well done, though you may wanna get an appropriate playlist together before you jump into this game. I do sincerely wish that Puppygames did a little more with the sound track like they did with Ultratron.\n\nControls are a simple WASD and mouse aim combo, or recently added by Puppygames, twin stick controller enabled. Though you do lose some aiming control using a controller. This would be my only other complaint about this game as it implores a lock on system that tends to make shooting distant or faster enemies hard to hit. This also cannot be disabled unless you are using the mouse and keyboard combo.\n\nAlso recently added by Puppygames is local co-op which gives this game additional value and replyability. Though there is no online co-op, local co-op sometimes makes fighting go beyond the computer player but with your co-op player for screen space.\n\nGameplay: Top Down Arena Shooter (could also be considered Twin Stick)\nGraphics: Great Contemporary Old School.\nSound: Great sounds effects and atmosphere though missing the music making it overall okay.\nControls: Great with mouse and keyboard. Okay with twin sticks (the aiming is more difficult than necessary).\nReplayability: OMG YES!\nOverall: 9/10 (-1 for disappointing controller aiming and lack of sound track)\n\nIt's an awesome and solid game and its old school arcade-ish simplicity has me coming back time and time again. It's a great buy for any collection!","October 2, 2014","true","9.8"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","0"

Admitedly, this is my least favorite Puppygames title so far, which isn't to say it's bad at all, just mainly a bit less of my type. A top down action game where You control a droid with WASD and aim with the mouse - left to shoot, right to hack/transfer. The idea is to destroy all enemy droids while keeping your party alive, which is MUCH easier said than done. The game is a bit less about action skill and more about the managment of your droids, as some are faster than others, or have better defense, or have different weapons more suited for a situation. It's fairly easy for your droids to die, but it's also fairly easy to hack other droids if you have enough transfer points. The AI that commands friendly drones is fairly competent at killing enemies, but not so much at staying alive, so there is a constant need to keep them out of harm's way. Things get real challenging with boss battles and danger areas that throw tons of bots at you - I Think it's expected that you will loose some droids, which will unfortunately loose any upgrades they had. A very clever tactical, action game that use simple mechanics that just work. A challenging game, and I think I got to at least level 30 before I died, but I don't think I can improve much on my skill after my team nearly got wiped out the in the previous couple levels. If the idea of the game appeals to you, definitely get it, just realize there is a big challenge ahead of you in the later level (Ironically, the game seems too easy at the beginning).","September 3, 2013","true","1.4"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

Initially, it seems like a great idea but unfortunately, it's pretty poorly executed, mainly due to how loose the team management is but otherwise due to how poorly the allied AI perform.\n\nThere's many ways this game could be improved, giving the player more control over their team would be a given, making the stats of each robot a little clearer so it's possible to identify the advantages and disadvantages of having them as part of your team as opposed to just hopping system to system blindly hoping for the best would be another, it's also possible to upgrade robots via pickups however they're incredibly vague too, perhaps if it was possible to equip each system individually and change their upgrades?\n\nI'd suggest giving this game a miss and checking out another of Puppygames works, they're definitely great developers and Droid Assault is simply not on par with their other three games.","January 24, 2014","false","1.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JohnHadley/recommended/219200/","JohnHadley","John Hadley","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JohnHadley/","984 products in account","This game is a great arcade style game like the old coin ops.  You play as a robot and you have to eliminate all the enemy robots before you can exit a stage and move to the next one.  As you play you get powerups that make your robot shoot faster, recharge faster, have more armor, do more damage per shot, and so on, but you can also capture other robots which allows you to switch into them.  There's walls in the level that you use for cover while you try to destroy the enemy robots and there's a bit of a stealth component to the game too because robots won't come after you and attack you unless they can see you or a security camera can see you.  You can capture other robots and use them so it acts almost as a class selection would in another game and lets you adjust your tactics to the particulars of the level.  There's also occasionally boss robots at the end of the levels, around every 10 levels or so.\n\nThis is a blast for ten minutes to an hour here or there when you just want to do a little shoot em up and you can save at any time and come back for later so its a perfect game for casual play.  This isn't a hardcore game so don't go into it expecting to play it for 20 hours.  Its an arcade shoot-em up so you'll get a similar amount of play time to those kind of games, but you won't be dragged down by tedium just designed to slow down gameplay to make a ten minutes of action take 4 hours.\n","December 23, 2013","true","9.3"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

Of course, there are other gameplay elements which may seem interesting at a glance, but believe me, they are not relevant to success in the game.\nThe developers tried to make it look like there is a lot of strategic thinking involved in the game, but I will try to show why that's not the case.\nYou think that having an army of droids is cool? Trying to come up with different combinations, etc... Nope. You can control one droid at a time and the others do whatever they want (read: stupidly die all the time). Having one buffed droid is the only valid "strategy".\nWhen you transfer to a droid, you don't know what you're going to get. Even when looking at a droid's information screen, the only thing you know for sure is how much health it has. Other pieces of information are either "ciphered" ("armour: kevlar", what does that tell you?) or just "lore" (affect nothing). At the same time, you have different ways for droids to interact: maybe some weapons work better against some armours... but we may never know, because there is a huge lack of information. Well, you could spend tons of time and compile a table with information on all the droids, deduce the meanings... but who wants to do that?\nFrom what I remember, the bosses are just big droids with big guns, nothing too special.\nBut it's not all that bad. The game looks cool, I guess. Upgrading the droids can feel nice...\nDroid Assault can be fun for a few hours, maybe for one playthrough, but it is not worth the full price.\n\n★★★★★☆☆☆☆☆","December 10, 2013","false","7.7"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","0"

Clearly inspired by the 1985 classic Commodore 64 game Paradroid. Bit less about arcade twitch reflexes and more about tactics and squad management than the other Puppy games, just a bit. You roam around with your bot, destroying other bots or taking them over with your transfer beam. Cleaning the building floor by floor. Unlike in Paradroid, you get to keep the old bodies as allies and transfer control at will to them as well. You could still play this game much like Paradroid keeping the control on and getting all the powerups for your best chassis and using the others as cannon fodder.\n\nWhat I miss about Paradroid is minigame for taking over the bots. Bit more elaborate than the concept of "transfer points" used here. Maybe they felt, it'd break the flow or something. Still a good game, though.","December 28, 2013","true","1.9"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

Back then the graphics were drawn lines and small human-like block droids that sounded like the Daleks from Dr. Who.  While the graphics in this game 'Droid Assault' aren't exactly the latest frostbyte engine of today... I don't believe they're meant to be either.\n\nThe developer 'puppygames' has a number of games that have this same nostalogic feel.  Graphics are a big part of that.  They've done a good job of giving you that nostolgic  feel but also giving you a new game entirely.  This game may remind me of that old 'Berzerk' game but it plays like a modern arcade game.\n\nYou play the part of a droid that has to neutralize other droids within a given facility (map) while they also try to neutralize you.  You can neutralize them by destroying them or hacking them.  There are different levels of destructive power and hacking capabilities of each droid depending on the droid.  After you hack a droid...  it's yours and you can then use that droid.  You can amass a team of different droids and switch between them.  If one is destroyed, you can still control one of your other droids.  After all your droids are destroyed then it's game over.  The levels move along by defeating each progressively challenging level and then getting a boss level.\n\nMovement was rather easy using WSAD for movement and using your mouse for aiming and firing with a kind of overhead view.  There's a number of games that use this method of movement and action for game play, so it's something you should prolly get used to if you haven't by now.  WSAD and left mouse button for firing... right button for hacking droids.  You have different levels of destruction and security for each droid and each droid is good for something that another isn't.  The idea is that you're able to utilize them as a team to do more havoc. The game gets progressively better as you learn to recognize the different droids and what their capabilities are.\n\nIt's a fun game.  I recommend for those 'arcade style'  junkies like myself.

You can switch between the model that fits best to the current combat situation. Most of the time you will have just 2-3 droids at your side, because its smart to overtake just the strongest models and destroy the weak ones...\n\nIf you are into classic arcade games with a retro touch I give you a strong recommendation!\nAnd for veterans of the good old C64 game Paradroid this is a must buy!\nHard and unforgiving as the original, but also with the same addiction that 8-bit games gave us.\nThe old school graphics are great and very cute!\n\n...did I mention it has a 2 player coop mode?!","January 30, 2014","true","19.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's your standard top-down twin stick shooter, but with the fascinating ability to completely hijack and become your enemies.\n\nI particularly enjoyed the discovery of different powers of various droids. They range from being able to hover, to shooting lasers. Outside of that gimmick, though, I'm not sure what else there is to say.\n\nI would have liked a way to scan the droids I am about to take over. As it is now, you have to remember what droids have what powers based on their appearance, which is kind of hard to tell since they all look vaguely alike. Also, the AI for your allied drones is just awful. I have no idea how to keep an army alive for any sort of boss.\n\nThere's a rudimentary upgrade system that is based entirely on random things dropped by the levels. I would have liked a way to upgrade things between levels as well.\n\nCuriously there tends to be little reward for blowing up enemies. I guess survival is its own reward, but would it have been too much to ask for experience or cash? Something that makes me stronger.\n\nI feel that the game suffers from its sheer lack of story or ending. At least Ultratron and Titan Attacks had a final stage before it loops to the beginning again. This game just goes on and on. It harkens a little too far back to the Atari days where we do nothing but play for points. I'm sure that style of gameplay appeals to some people, but definitely not me.\n\nOverall, fun at first, but becomes completely and utterly pointless.","April 25, 2014","true","3.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

While that's a good thing, that doesn't necessarily make the gameplay awesome as well.\n\nI enjoyed Revenge Of The Titans. It looked simple, but the gameplay was more complex than you might have initially thought. Droid Assault uses this same principle, but it is more shallow. It mixes action with some light strategy elements.\n\nThe goal is to capture (more and bigger) droids and use them to kill the remaining droids. Once you've killed them all it's on to the next level until, after 10 levels, you face a boss. Then the whole thing continues, in some sort of a cycle, and the game becomes harder and harder.\n\nKilling droids will reward you with power-ups that might help you on your quest to become a bad ♥♥♥ droid. All upgrades are permanent, but if you lose a droid it's gone forever. So you have to carefully maneuver around.\n\nI had fun for about an hour, then I quickly lost interest. Revenge Of The Titans still remains the best PuppyGames game to date. Give that one a try instead.\n\n[Rating: 61/100]","March 28, 2013","true","2.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Worldwaker/recommended/219200/","Worldwaker","Worldwaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Worldwaker/","313 products in account","This is a game from the creators of Revenge Of The Titans, a top-down shooter at it's core and so much more once you get into the depths. Each bot you can control has a generally unique description and use, some are good at tanking, others good at firing missles from a distance. This game encourages exploration and essentially is a score attacker's wet dream.\n\nBreaking down the mechanics, you can control up to 8 different units at a time, although doing so is risky. Once you release control of a certain droid, you've handed it over to the AI which isn't entirely tantamount to suicide for the bot, but damn near close. Either way, you'll be doing most of the work unless you simply don't want to. There's a variety of playstyles that Droid Assault caters to, from the sniper to the tank, and better yet.\n\nThere's upgrades. Not all upgrades apply to all bots, but the vast majority do. Speed, defense, attack damage, armor. Powerups litter the field and the game pushes you do pop open every single crate for that either special overleveled bot, or a weaker variant that might just drop that piece of salvation you've been looking for. Crates themselves serve as holding containers for random bots geared towards the level you're playing on. So you won't be getting a massive boss-esque bot out of one in your first level or two.\n\nMoving onto Bosses, there are a slew of them in the game that all follow the same archetype. Two to four guns on each side which are destroyable for further powerups, and a primary weapon. Tactics mean everything or nothing depending on how well you've progressed. There's a defenite rougelite element to the game and it's worth replaying over and over if only to get that final ending.\n\nBasically, buy it. It's good, fun, and a new update just included local co-op which supports the gamepad wonderfully. You wont regret it unless you've forgotten there's a demo out as well: http://www.moddb.com/games/droid-assault/downloads/droid-assault-demo","May 21, 2014","true","23.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

They looked decent, with the type of art style that has always appealed to me in a game. I decided not to do much research on them, as I was paying a very low amount of money for them. The other games included Titan Attacks, Revenge of the Titans, and Ultratron (all enjoyable games, especially Revenge of the Titans, a great tower defense-type game), but this is the one that really stood out since it felt like the most unique of the 4. In Droid Assault, you start off with a singular, weak and tiny robot. As you move through levels you can hack the other robot opponents that you face, and add them to your team to play with you as you go through the coming levels, or shoot them down. I don't know what the maximum amount of robots to have in your party is, but at one point I had 5 seperate robots running around one level destorying and hacking other robots. At the bare minimum, this game will be a very fun time-waster, but I think that it has much more potential than that.......","December 27, 2013","true","1.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

These stats can also be improved by collecting powerups dropped by fallen enemies. More powerful droids are more expensive to capture, so in theory there is deep strategy when deciding which droids to capture. However, this is mostly negated by the stupid friendly AI. The player only controls one droid at a time, and the rest of your squad will just do their own thing. Maybe theyll follow you, maybe theyll wander off in a random direction.

Obviously, they have a thing for robots and industrial environments. Mind you, I'm not knocking this in any way. Some of their games could be considered clones of others, while others feel highly original. For Droid Assault, in particular, I'm leaning toward original.\n\nWhat they manage to do is take time tested and common game types and add their own Robo-flavor to them, coating them in simple, high stylized, and easily recognizable graphics. My favorite indie game companies are the ones in which they've made a brand for themselves and exploit that brand in a beautiful way. PuppyGames seems particularly adept at doing that.\n\nI have no problem playing their games, but they do feel somewhat repetitive after a short while, and sticking with one until the end isn't something I've had the followthrough to do yet. It's not that I don't find them fun, it's just that they're best suited to short bursts of game play.\n\nA few other small details that some might consider useful - listen to the music, it's not that bad! Also, follow the tutorials and build your little army of bots. How something so cute can end up being so badass will make your head spin. There's nothing unfriendly or uninviting about any of their [PuppyGames] software, and this is the type of thing that kids who can grasp gameplay concepts and adults will enjoy.\n\nGood job guys, but why not drop the price of the game buy a couple bucks? The price is a little steep considering. Get the Ultrabundle, where the games are priced around the level that they should be and a few of the items could be considered little bonuses.\n\n6.5/10 For fun factor, a lack of bugs, cute branding that's instantly recognizable, and the ease on system resources. Points lost for not being very engrossing or addictive, and for the price. Dropping the price by two bucks would easily bump this up to a 7, but without significant improvements otherwise, it wouldn't go any higher for me.","October 3, 2014","true","1.2"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

He then said it was supported, but not when it doesn't work.\nHe also said that steam was 32-bit only, and couldn't launch 32-bit games. Neither of those things is true.\nTheir response to me pointing that out was basically "well, I guess maybe _now_, but we don't have time, so it doesn't matter". If you don't have time, that's fine, but why are you selling abandonware at any price?\nIt's a Java program. It doesn't even need to care about bit depth. For some reason they're shipping the entire Java runtime with their games. WHY?\n\nBasically, they're lazy and incompetant. If you call them out on their BS, they patronise you, insult you and ban you.\n\nI can't criticise the game itself, because I can't play it. No joystick support. No QWERTY keyboard. No remapping. The joystick config file ("doesn't work? you fix it!") is virtually undocumented, and doesn't behave in a way that makes sense.

So i tried a different strategy: not creating an army at all, and instead focus on transfering to a single robot with more survivability, and then collect as many powerups as possible to increase said survivability.\nAnd what i found was that the game doesn't drop enough powerups in order to make this possible. So i gave up.\n\nNow there seems to be people who have beaten this game, so something must work. and it may just be i who suck. But in the end i still cannot recommend Droid Assault, because it's too dependent on its AI, creating artificial difficulty as a result. Something simply ain't right when one has to avoid using the main mechanic of the game.\n\nEDIT: I did manage to beat it, but only by exploiting the "sharp bullet" power-up that allows you to shoot through walls. I picked a robot with high survivability and upgraded it fully. and then i just hid in ventilation shafts etc. and shot blindly towards that which the radar pointed me to. (the radar points you to the closest enemy)\nI have a feeling that the developers didn't intend me to beat the game that way","December 14, 2014","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Normal firepower, heavy firepower, flamethrowers, shotguns, grenades, superbombs, lasers, rapid fire, and even many more are mixes of those! It isn't too easy, or too hard either, its just at the right area where the beginning is easy, the middle is a decent challenge, and the ending is hard, just like it should be. Don't forget about the powerups either, where you can boost your speed, damage, armor, battery size, and battery recharge rate, as well as immunity to special, rarer attack styles like lasers, fire, and EMPs.

The gameplay is set around the ability to take over other droids using transfer power, and then using your droids to destroy the corrupted ones.  There are tons upon tons of different droids to use. Normal firepower, heavy firepower, flamethrowers, shotguns, grenades, superbombs, lasers, rapid fire, and even many more are mixes of those! It isn't too easy, or too hard either, its just at the right area where the beginning is easy, the middle is a decent challenge, and the ending is hard, just like it should be. Don't forget about the powerups either, where you can boost your speed, damage, armor, battery size, and battery recharge rate, as well as immunity to special, rarer attack styles like lasers, fire, and EMPs. Its always a lot of fun to dump upgrades on one robot to create a killing machine of mass destruction. This is easily the most fun I have had in years.","November 26, 2014","true","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So i tried a different strategy: not creating an army at all, and instead focus on transfering to a single robot with more survivability, and then collect as many powerups as possible to increase said survivability.\nAnd what i found was that the game doesn't drop enough powerups in order to make this possible. So i gave up.\n\nNow there seems to be people who have beaten this game, so something must work. and it may just be i who suck. But in the end i still cannot recommend Droid Assault, because it's too dependent on its AI, creating artificial difficulty as a result. Something simply ain't right when one has to avoid using the main mechanic of the game.\n\nEDIT: I did manage to beat it, but only by exploiting the "sharp bullet" power-up that allows you to shoot through walls. I picked a robot with high survivability and upgraded it fully. and then i just hid in ventilation shafts etc. and shot blindly towards that which the radar pointed me to. (the radar points you to the closest enemy)\nI have a feeling that the developers didn't intend me to beat the game that way","December 14, 2014","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style that they are probably most known for is completely at its peak here. It draws inspiration from many different titles, unlike some of their other games that only draw from a few, and plays a bit like Smash TV. Basically, the game breaks down to you being a virus and contaminating robots to kills other robots and continue to contaminate more robots. This game gets very difficult very quick, and the boss battles are fun and challenging. There is also an almost roguelike element to this game in the robots you acquire. There are multiple combinations of armor types, weapons, sensors and the such that work in many different combinations that makes each one slightly unique. Because of this you sometimes find yourself thinking whether this robot or that one would be best, or if you should save your transfers and continue hunting. Every playthrough is a little different, and there is a certain level of strategy involved, which keeps it fresh every time you play. Lots of fun, I would recommend it to anyone, especially with the low end price tag its offered at.","January 11, 2014","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would give this game thumbs up if it would just start with a decent default controller setup or a screen that let me configure it in game.

I like it. This game plays nice until the end. Then it gets nasty mean. The graphics are just right. A simple retro style that looks sweet without adding excess details. There isn't much to the music tracks here but the sound effects more than make up for it as the game sucks you in. In the start you start as only as a harmless droid with a nasty vitus. As you hack other droids, your army grows. More powerful droids require more 'hacking' points. But to keep your army from growning too powerful... well the boss levels are pretty good at wiping out your friendly droids every ten levels. The other factor is harder levels are loaded with more deadly droids that their 'hacking' points allow you to only hack one powerful one or a few less powerful ones but easier to destroy droids. In other words, your very strength in the beginning of the game turns into your weakness. After level 40, if you don't hack the most powerful droid, you just wont last long but your friendly droid may fight with you but is all too easy for enemy droids to take out even if it's more powerful on the simple note it's outnumbered and trades shots instead of dodging and shooting. Near the end this game turns into a nightmare as the game simply out-numbers you with tough droids that you can only hack one or two and the hacked friendly droids die quickly under the enemy firepower. Your best chance to beat the game is to hack the most powerful droid in the game but even with that the final board still mows me down in seconds by overwhelming firepower and droids on level 56 with no walls to hid behind and widdle away the enemy army. I don't know if that's the last level because I see it very unlikely that I wi be able to beat it. Recommend this game? Yes, it was very well done except that cheap ending. Fun to play until the ending kills you with shear numbers , firepower and no dodging or hiding space at all.","December 24, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
