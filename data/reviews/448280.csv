If you don't have VR you cant play the game.... I myself dont have a VR device, so i had to refund the game.. I wish they would make it more easier to see if its a VR only game etc in the future on steam. Anyways cant really review the game so this is more of an warning to others who dont have VR who want to play this game.\n\n\nedit: They updated store page with a tiny "vr only" in the description.","April 5","true","0.1"," 571 of 730 people (78%) found this review helpful 63 people found this review funny","78","571","730","63","39"

I wish I could enjoy you.  I can see the appeal, don't get me wrong, but as an avid gamer it just doesn't really do anything for me - even viewing it purely as an experience, I couldn't get into it.  I appreciate the humor, the attention to detail, the heart, but...  it just doesn't hold my attention, even compared to other experiences.  If it were $5, even $10, I could see myself recommending it as an "intro to VR" type experience.\n\nI think the real issue is that the world doesn't respond to your decisions whatsoever.  The game comes down to "here's a simple task, now do whatever you want to do, and the game will move onto another task."  From what I can tell, the game plays out the same no matter what you do. Let's say it asks you to make a sandwich and you make it out of uncooked bacon, an apple and a CD-Rom and then serve it up... the game moves onto the next task.  Whoopie, CD-Rom sandwich and no one cares.  Hilarious the first few times, especially with some friends in the room, but after the fifteenth time, it just gets stale.\n\nTL;DR:  Good for intro VR, great writing, but your (often funny) decisions are meaningless and the world is unresponsive to them. It's probably not worth the price.\n\nThat's my two cents.","April 7","false","1.6"," 348 of 484 people (72%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","72","348","484","17","28"

When I start letting people come over to play, I'll be using this. I'm normally not interested in physics based sandboxes, but this is more than that.

You are a human simulating the most boring jobs of the 21st century in a museum based on the warped history of your robot overlords.\n\nThe inaccuracies between reality and the job simulator are often satirical or just silly (like having to change headlight fluid as a mechanic.) The humor and polish are very reminiscent of a Valve game. While it may not blow you away, it is extremely accessible and is a suprisingly fun social game.\n\nPros:Very well polished.\nComes with four complete jobs: Office Worker, Gourmet Chef, Store Clerk, and Auto Mechanic.\nDialog with robot customers and coworkers is often comical.\nGags and pop culture references EVERYWHERE.\nGiven that there is no locomotion they make excellent use of the space your are given. Example: When you're a chef you can flip a switch to replace your sink with a blender or a microwave.\nKid Friendly.\nFantasic demo game for people new to VR.\nConsistent 90fps, one of the most stable VR games I've played. Especially considering how nice it looks.\nAs I said earlier a suprisingly good social game. When you have one person playing and have some people on the couch something magical happens. Observers heckle/shout out commands, laughing at the goofy interactions of the player - it's a good time all around.\nNeutral:By it's nature all tasks are extremely simple.\nI can imagine you'd run into issues if you had a smaller than average play space, but that's not the games fault.\nCons:Once you've played through each of the jobs there is little replayability. Unless you count laughing at other people playing it.\nFeels like an extended demo rather than a full game, however, even at $30 I'd probably recommend it. (If HTC were to discontinue it being bundled with the Vive in the future.) While $30 is steep for the time it takes to beat, I'd say it's roughly on par with the rest of the VR catalog, as generally most games are overpriced. Which again, makes sense given the relatively small playerbase.\nRig: Intel Core i7-5930K, 32GB DDR4 2800, (x2) EVGA GTX 980 SC (One card dedicated to PhysX), 500GB Samsung 840 Evo SSD, Win 10.","May 18","true","4.6"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","3"

It turns out that it's my children's (ages 8, 11, 12) favorite game and the one they go back to every single day. Who figured they would like to Job so much at such a young age.\n\nFor those of us adults, this game really is one of the best introductions to VR to play in a room with other people, and while the replay value isn't as great for us, the party aspects when you have a second monitor hooked up and an audience is really funny.\n\nThis is a great game. And I hope they add a few extra environments over the next few months. Humor, characters and the "story" are perfectly done for this kind of game.\n\n5/5.

Fun and entertaining. It is a good game to get people aquainted with VR. It is a bit on the short  side. I spent 30 minutes playing around in the office and completing objectives. The whole game is likely only 3 - 4 hours of content for most people.  The cost is a bit high for the amount of time an indiviual may spend playing, but this is also one of the first games for consumer VR.

Its quirky style and polish will have you immersed quickly. If you are anything like me, you won't be able to resist waving and/or throwing things at the many NPCs. The attention to detail and ability to do lots of unexpected functions will not stop making me smile.\n\nThat being said, I cannot see myself getting more than 10-15 hours of gameplay out of this title. I enjoy showing it to friends and family, would gladly pay the $30 if it had not come with my Vive, but would be even more excited to see what the developers could do creating content with more replay value.","May 4","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thereddevil666/recommended/448280/","thereddevil666","FDR Logging","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thereddevil666/","459 products in account","======================================\n(First Impressions) - Job Simulator\n======================================\n\nVideo - https://youtu.be/BndklhqtwtU\n\n**Gameplay/My Experience**\n\nI start things off in a large white room greeted by friendly robots instructing me about where I am. Job Simulator is based on the idea that all mankind has died many years ago and now robots rule the world. I am visiting this place to experience the everyday jobs of the previous humans of the past.\n\nOn the table in front of me is a tray of video game cartridge shaped objects with job titles on them, I take the first one "Office Worker" and toss it into the machine. I'm now transported to an office and inside a worker's cubicle. I am surrounded by all the common things an office might have like computers, printers, staplers and such. I am then greeted by a robot who informs me that humans in this time liked to eat lots doughnuts and sugar filled coffee's prior to a work day.\n\nA cart appears with a box of doughnuts and coffee mugs, I am able to open the box grab a doughnut pull it do my face and experience a satisfying chomp out of it. Naturally I begin to grab them with both hands quickly chomping away the whole box in seconds. Next I take the coffee mug and fill it with creamer, sugar and lots of coffee so much that it overflows and spills everywhere.\n\nI begin grabbing random items off the desk such as the stapler that allows you to fire staples in a gun like fashion or the copy machine which ironically lets you copy whole objects like plants or multiple staplers for duel wielding fun. You can interact with the computer, painting or even making a power point presentation for a future mission. The office worker is jam packed with over 1.5+ hours worth of missions and tons of fun things to mess with.\n\nI head back to the main games lobby via summoning a briefcase and eating the "really" burrito, very creative concept. Next I choose the chef worker which allows me to prepare food for hungry customers. You can make bizarre sandwiches create a variety of soups mixing ingredients in a large stove top pot. The missions are fun and get you to explore almost every single aspect of the cooking area. Feel like juggling tomatoes? want to make a nuclear tea? feel like making a wine steak burnt toast omelet sandwich? or maybe you just enjoy listening to music and tossing random items into the piranha tank across the hall to be chipped? whatever it is your looking to mess around with in a kitchen this has it.\n\nThe other two jobs were auto mechanic and store clerk. As a clerk I was able to serve my "happy" customers by providing them with common store items they asked for. I was able to ring up items multiple times, short change them, burn there food, throw things at them. Basically do everything you ever wanted to do as a fed up person in customer service. Moving onto the auto mechanic you take on the roll of a swindly mechanic fixing clients cars as they arrive at your garage. pull apart the cars and give them cheap parts to save a buck, replace the battery with a potato, fill the gas tank with hot sauce, attempt to throw a Frisbee out the garage door at passing cars. The sky is the limit in all these jobs and it truly is a blast interacting with objects in the environment.\n\n==================================================\n\n** Graphics/Audio **\n\nSimple cartoon style graphics are pleasantly used in this game and give your a fun feeling and care free experience. Objects are all very intractable and well detailed for the way they function. I was constantly testing things to see if they would react the way my mind assumed they would and sure enough they did exactly what I imagined very pleased with that.\n\nThe audio is also very good, its comedic and the sound effects are very cartoon-esk loud drippy sounds from pouring liquid and bonk and smash sounds from breaking and throwing objects. The robots speaking is also a great laugh going from a random smooth talking to a monotone inserted statement really brings up some great humor filled moments.\n\n==================================================\n\n**VR/Comfort**\n\nI have only experienced a few tracking issues as others have had at the time of this review, but for the most part the game is exceptionally accurate in the tracking. I am easily able to toss objects in the air and catch them with the other hand. Moving around the room feels great and unhindered by any design issues.\n\nThere were no moments of sickness or uncomfortable feelings throughout my 5 hours of playing this title so far, very smooth and very well designed for VR.\n\n==================================================\n\n**My Wishlist**\n\nI'm really hoping for more experiences to come soon, more jobs, more ideas to keep me invested in the game.\n\nI would really like to see some sort of multiplayer implemented in the future, and perhaps co op games where you would have to work together to prepare a meal or perform a task.\n\n==================================================\n","May 5","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The fact that the robots often don’t quite grasp how things actually were makes for funny cutscenes.\n\nFurther, all the jobs contain a lot of loving detail and (to me) unexpected humour. As an example, as a car mechanic, one of your tasks is to sabotage a customer’s car as per SlzBot’s (Sleaze-Bot, your boss) instructions.\n\nI spent a few hours in this and haven’t yet explored all jobs there are.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bfrieres/recommended/448280/","bfrieres","Toasty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bfrieres/","82 products in account","As a newcomer to the whole VR world, this game is great at introducing you to it. It is an incredibly intuitive game to play, and the game never gets stale, as there is always something going on either in the foreground or the background. Another thing to note is the attention to detail! You see a copying machine, and because your butt isn´t virtual yet, you try it with your hands, and it works! You get virtual printouts of your virtual hands! ( I am starting to ramble aren´t I?) This game is in my opinion a must have for everyone getting into VR or as a showcase for friends to introduce them to VR. The only thing I find really regrettable is the hefty price-point of this game. I get, that an enormous amount of work went into it, but you just burn through the 4 available jobs which you can partake in, even more so, when there is The Lab, where you get more diversity, an equal amount of play time for free... Don´t get me wrong, this game deserves every credits it gets, evenmore so because it runs brilliantly without any issues on my more or less mediocre Pc, it´s just too expensive. TL:Dr If you have the money, get this game, if you don´t, maybe opt for games like Audioshield or Hover Junkers, as you get longer enjoyment out of those games.","June 4","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The tasks can get a bit boring sometimes but don't let that stop you from experimenting with all the things you're given! An overall fun experience to do in your room.","April 7","true","3.4"," 15 of 30 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","15","30","4","0"

Unfortunately alot of VR content is.\n\nJob simulator is more like a bunch of small demos than a game itself. It's just a proof of concept for interaction with motion controllers in VR. I tried it and it's neat, there is quite the attention to detail. But the spaces are small and replayability is not something i see this game having. If you get it in the bundle then definately try it out. But dont pay 28 brouzoufs for this collection of demos.

My rig's got an i5-2500k OC'ed to 4.2Ghz (temperature at constant 56°C), 32GB Ram and a 980TI, so it should run this game somewhat decent. Unfortunately, it doesn't. Now before anyone complains that my CPU's too slow, it shouldn't be. This game uses just a constant 50-60% of all 4 cores, with 1 core pushing to 90% about every 5 seconds (garbage collector?). GPU isn't even anywhere near stressed, sitting at 18-25%.\n\nYet, the game is stuttering permanently - missing frames constantly. No such problems with other VR games, and the proposed fixes by the developers have not caused the stutter to go away.\n\nWill try again if an update is released, but for now, I can't give this game a good recommendation due to it's performance problems.","May 23","false","0.8"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"
