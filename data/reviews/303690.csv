Here's the gist, you catch fish, feed the best ones to your pet, he transforms into some type of fantasy inspired killing machine, use him to clear out your next fishing hole, repeat.\n\nNow, there is no doubt other ways to approach this game, you can run quests and completely ignore the fishing. It's almost like it's a fully realized action RPG like Diablo, with lots of weapons, armor and items to collect. Which is neat.\n\nStill, you are better served by fishing, and letting your pet take care of the action rpg aspect. He'll complete quests for you as you search for your next fishing hole, and run any of the crap that drops from the monsters back to town for you, as you get in some quality angling time!","November 20, 2014","true","15.5"," 98 of 108 people (91%) found this review helpful 64 people found this review funny","91","98","108","64","4"

Open the game directory and set the Compatibilty Mode to Windows XP (Service Pack 3)\n2. Locate the .dat file named "default_config.dat" and open it with Notepad\n3. Change the setting "FULLSCREEN" from "1" to "0" and save it\n4. Launch Fate: The Cursed King and it should work fine now\n\nThe only downside is that selecting the Fullscreen option crashes the game\nUPDATE - Do NOT select the "Fullscreen" option from the settings. It will make the game crash and retrying this method wont make it work anymore.\n\nMETHOD #2 - Results in a perfect fix but requires downloading some files.\n\n1. Head onto reshade.me and download the problem and save it to your desktop\n2. Extract it onto your desktop (or directory of your choosing)\n3. Open the extracted folder and double click on the Mediator.exe file\n4. On the left hand side, there will be a bar with the world "Add" next to it, click on "Add"\n5. You will need to navigate to your Fate.exe which is in C: > Program Files (x86) > Steam > steamapps > Common > Fate the Cursed King. Click on Fate.exe to add it to ReShade\n6. Make sure the mode below the bar is set to Direct3D 8\n7. Hit "Apply" at the top of the window and close everything out\n8. Try playing Fate and it should work perfectly fine without and Fullscreen or windowed bugs.\n\nEnjoy (Do not credit me for this fix, I just reposted this so more people will see)","September 19, 2015","true","8.1"," 37 of 38 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","37","38","0","0"

My first ever full fledged PC game (that wasn't educationally intended) Was the original FATE. This, FATE: The Cursed King, is the last installment of the series, and I reccomend playing this one above all the other ones. This series is one of the few where it just keeps getting better by the next installment. Without changing what wasn't broken. If you've played the first, you can easily adapt to this one. While adding new elements as well, and FINALLY having no level cap, this is definately worth your time. Also, if you've played Diablo 2, you'll notice similairties with the inventories.\nThat's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. Easily anyone can pick up and play this.\nYou also can get Henchmen, which have three different styles you can make them think. Heal, Defensive, and Offense.\nAlso, like yourself, you have complete control (besides moving them) of them. Spells, items, weapons, inventories...It's all grand. The amount of loot in this game is absurd, as well. Everything from the previous games are here, while also new ones and designs are added. Plus, FIVE. DIFFERENT. INFINITE. DUNGEONS.\n\nAlso, I've made a guide for the game. It's really only useful if you've never played a FATE game, but It's also the only guide for the game. I've put a decent amount of effort into it- I spent my time to make a guide for this game. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=352488747\nShouldn't that say enough?

But when I found out it was on STeam, I just had to buy it, and did.

Back when this was created in 2011, it had Facebook connectivity where you could send characters, items, etc. to all your friends who also connected F:TCK to Facebook. Oh, those days were good.\n\nFor any people saying that this is just a knock-off of Torchlight/Torchlight 2, it is because the creator of FATE was ALSO the creator of the Torchlight series. You can think of these games as a predecessor of sorts to the Torchlight series. Both series are amazing, just they both have flaws that one series or another improves on.\n\nAnother good thing about F:TCK (And the others in the series, for that matter) is that it is easily moddable. Even I, a person with no experience, can get in and mod the game for custom players, pets, weapons, etc. That is something I also enjoy about this series.\n\nAnd the best part about the FATE games is that it wasn't completely new and foreign elelments thrown into the game; they just kept building off what worked, adding more and more content each time. Highly recommend this game to everyone who likes dungeon crawlers. 9.5/10","December 29, 2014","true","76.7"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","15","18","5","1"

On one hand, it is what it is, more of the classic FATE gameplay at a very low price. I was a huge fan of Fate 1 and 2 and so I jumped at the chance to grab this. And yes, it delivered on giving me more FATE.\n\nProblem is that there really isn't any reason to play this. They haven't updated any of the spells, the graphics haven't advanced at all, the story is non-existant, movement is slow, the skills aren't interesting and even combat seems 'meh'. It all just feels old and tedious. Yeah, killing stuff and finding loot always has an alure, but there are just much better options to spend your time playing.\n\nAbsolutely everything in this game was just done better in Torchlight 2. If you want to play an amazing ARPG, play that. If you just want to blow some time killing and looting and don't mind playing on an engine from 10 year ago, I suppose this isn't your worst option, just not a great one.","November 21, 2014","false","2.1"," 57 of 98 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","57","98","0","2"

Even so, this game has always been highly addicting to me, and I recommend to anyone who just wants a game that'll give them some quests to do in their free time.

This is definitely one of my favorite childhood games, I remember bieng in third or fourth grade and me and my brother taking turns on just the demo of the game, and that time held some of the greatest moments of my childhood, and when I was in fifth grade I bought the full game disc with my own money and played that for hours a day, and now to this day I have every Fate game on disc except for this one Cursed King, so when I saw it was on steam, I bought it right away.\n\nGameplay You start off by selecting what difficulty you want the game at and the kind of character you want to be, there are a total of 5 characters, one of them new to the series, and you can customize your looks and name, and then you can choose a pet, two pets are new to the series, and you choose your name for your pet as well. Then, the majority of what you do in the game, is accept quests from different people in town, and go out to the dungeon level, complete it, come back, and get paid. You level up and improve certain skills, you identify rare items you find, you can combine gems and weapons for powerful mixes, you can gamble your money away and hope for a great item, you can fish and cross your fingers for a lucky item, you can collect different cards and redeem them in town for extra skill points, you can find wanders in dungeons that have items for sale, you can find a statue that can give you ancient gems, you can transform your pet into a complete monster just by givin em a fish, you can learn spells that can summon mobs, throw a fireball, heal you, and so much more.\n\nThis game is the greatest RPG dungeon crawler I have ever played, and topped off on all of that there is steam trading cards and achievements! For only $8 this is an amazing game, and you may consider buying the others in the set as well, as there is different monsters, and different worlds to explore.\n\nWhats the differences between previous games and this one?This game has added:\n-1 more character to play as\n-2 more pets to choose from\n-Keys, that unlock different sized chests and have better loot than normal chests\n-Allies, AI-controlled allies that will fight for you, and you can put on items on them just like you can with yourself and they have skills too, quite a big edition\n-More spells, not sure how many have been added, but I know the summon tesla spell is new and I remember I few others, I will update the review if I find out\n-1 more new fish, the tadpole I believe\n-Tons of more monsters\n-Tons of more weapons\n- Different achievements to earn\n- Different emotes, backgrounds, and trading cards to collect\n- And of course, I brand new world, with brand new characters in town\n\nSo is it worth getting this Fate if you have the last one? Well, there isnt a WHOLE lot added to this new Fate, but there is a few gamechanges aspects like keys and allies, I recommend this game to older Fate players if they are REALLY into Fate, and truly want to expierence all the different titles have to offer.\n\nFinal Judgement: 8.5/10  Fate: The Cursed King, is a great addition to all of the titles. The core gameplay might seem repetative to some, but there is so many features players can play into, like names of items, and all of the spells, and fishing, and identifying items, and Tarot cards, and so much more. If you like RPGs, or like Dungeon Crawlers, you want to pick up this game right now, its a great edition to your steam library and for only 8 bucks you might even consider picking up some of the earlier titles :)","March 5","true","24.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

GET OUTTA HERE, FATE'S MY TERRITORY M80. jk plox no kill. But seriously, I have played all 4 FATE games, so I do know what I am talking about.\n\nNow that I am almost done with the game, I can talk about this game more. So let's go.\n\nAs a long time fan of FATE in general, I have to say this is the best game of them all. Hands down. There are just so many things to do in this game. Not to mention the improvements from the original to where we are now with FATE:TCK. It took me around 5 hours to beat the original FATE, and my character was level 12.\n\nWell...\nIT TOOK ME ALMOST 8-9 HOURS EXTRA TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE I AM NOW!!!!\nThank you WildTangent! Games that ACTUALLY TAKE EFFORT TO BEAT are awesome, espicially when it's an RPG. Love you guys! No homo though.\n\nThe character I have in TCK is Level 50, with much better gear, not because I wanted to, but because it was required. The monsters I am fighting now are from level 75-85, which is insane. I get one banged sometimes even though I have good stuff, and thats what I call challenging.\n\nThere are also allies. Allies, you say? What the hell are those? Well, young or old or middle aged person, I will tell you. They are AI controlled allies that can be unlocked when you reach the levels 10, 20, and 30. They will each get EXP and Fame individually, which is great. You can also fully equip them! Even better. (The AI isn't that good though, they just attack whatever you attack) However, you can change the stances that your allies go into. Agro (red lightning bolt) is where they charge foward at enemies, no questions asked. Supportive (orange shield) is where they stay relatively close to you, but they don't stay on your ♥♥♥ the whole time. They will attack enemies. And finally passive (blue heart) which is the best one by far.\nThis makes your ally....\njust sit next to you like that one clingy chick in your high school class who wont leave you the hell alone. They don't attack anything either while in this stance. SO WHATS THE DAMN POINT WILDTANGENT?????\n\nThere's fishing, too. Which is a get rich quick strat for beginners, and has basically become a meme in the FATE community.\nPRO TIP: BUY A FISHING POLE AND FISH A WHOLE CRAPTON IN TOWN WHEN STARTING A NEW GAME. YOUR GOLD VALUE FROM SELLING ITEMS SHOULD SKYROCKET.\n\nThere's a new story, new dungeons, new pets, new music, new armor, spells, and weapons, and basically new everything.\n\nAnyway, FATE TCK is the best game in the series by far, and my favorite game on Steam overall. Definetely worth the buy. Good game.","March 6","true","33.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Maybe they weren't that bad for their time, but there's no reason to play them anymore (assuming there ever was).  They get old quickly, and there's hardly anything to distinguish them from each other (they're so similar, I have no problem just copying and pasting the same review on each of the three that I own).  Moreover, there's nothing to distinguish them from the more recent Torchlight (not surprising, given that the Runic Games team includes ex-WildTangent devs), except Torchlight is better in every respect: better graphics, better combat, and better performance (despite being developed for Pentium systems, the FATE games still manage to overheat my Core 2 Duo gaming laptop even while running at 800x640 with minimal graphics quality).  Want to play a dungeon crawler?  Play Torchlight.  Already played Torchlight?  You're still probably better off replaying it, or playing its sequel (disclaimer: I have not).  If you really insist on getting a FATE game, I suggest starting with Cursed King, since it at least adds a little more character customization and a much-needed button to quickly swap weapon loadouts.","January 29","false","2.8"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

In time you will learn town portal and identifaction spells, sure, but that does not make the lack of item stacking any more forgivable.\n- There is a limited number of quick use potion slots, they too will not stack your potions.\n- Stamina declines rapidly when running/walking at first. You will not regain it unless you make your character stop dead and then start walking again.\n- Audio in general is off-putting and the BMG is really just very dull.\n- Item selection is made awkward by the fact that you at no point is told what the different colour codes stand for. Meaning you're left to assume which colour code is superior using the generic system of white being the worst then increasing to green, then blue, purple and so on upwards. This is not viable considering this game series appears to be targeted at newer players considering the very simple mechanics of the game.\n- Poor graphics. I am willing to grant that there is a certain charm in using classical graphical design styles, but the problems with them remain the same as they always were: it is difficult to really notice what is going on. Shading is poor, graphics overlap when there are enemies storming at you and all attacking you at once.  I agree that graphics does not make a game, and a game is not made bad from having bad graphics, but when so many other things are lacking in this game I am left wondering where exactly they put their effors, because it certainly was not put into improving graphics since the last FATE game.\n-Minimap in town is close to useless as you are expected to navigate your way thrugh the town by looking at a completely white minimap with colour coded NPCs. Yet again the colour code is not revealed to the player, so you'll have to work that out yourself as well. In dungeons you get a set of three different sizes of the minimap. One of which is far too small to navigate by, one of which is too large to navigate by, and one which you can navigate by, but you can barely see your character (a single dot on the minimap).\n- Although there are many items with specifically generated names making the item unique there appear so far to be very few different looks to the different items, meaning the items are not really special in any way, the developers were just kind enough to add an item name generator into the game.\n- Interacting with NPCs is a pain. It is slow, cumbersome and overall just insanely annoying. So is selling pet items.\n- You can only have four available quests at a time despite the fact that there are only four dungeouns and they could just as well be giving you all the quests for one dungeons in one go no matter what floor the quest is on. (there are several floors to each dungeon, and as far as i got it appeared there would be two-three quests per floor of a dungeon. Which is semi-practical i suppose because by then you will have fought through a hoarde of 100 monsters or so by standing still and holding the left mouse button down casting the occasional spell and picked up whatever loot is there to be had and.. your inventory should be brimming with industrial grade crap to sell to the vendor in town.\n\n\nIt is strange to me how many people have given this game positive reviews. I can understand the nostalgic thrill of reliving youth by playing games similar to those mixed with the thrill of something new, but let's be perfectly honest, there is nothing new about this. You really don't need to compare this game to the Torchlight or Diablo franchise to realize it's a bad game all in all. That is not necessarily saying the entire franchise of FATE is, but this particular game is just.. no. Not worth it.\nGame mechanics are poor, so much twitching mixed with the lack of the most basic things that hack and slash games need. Bad audio and graphics mixed with predicatably generated maps and the lack of excitement in the gameplay I would expect from this kind of game. With other games with similar styles of gameplay when i had a hardcore character i sat with my heart in my throat, with this game i was almost begging common mobs to kill my character so I could stop playing as I'd decided so long as that character was alive I was going to progress in an attempt to give this game a chance. Even boss fights are uninteresting and downright dull.","January 10, 2015","false","4.2"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","6","18","0","0"

FATE is like the missing link that came between those two games.\n\nSadly, the only reason for my thumbs-down here is to help purchasors beware it's become impossible for most users to play any of the FATE games anymore under Windows 10.\n\nSo I'd just hold onto your wallets for now:  Don't  assume that since your other games are still running smoothly after you upgraded to Windows 10 that any of the FATE series will.  It won't!\n\nFATE unfortunately just has critical compatibility issues now with Windows 10; can't get any further than the first menu or so for most users without a crash to desktop no matter what tips they try.\n\nIt's a shame to lose being able to play such a classic as FATE.

Racial negation stats & skills with AI controlled.\n- Underground maps : like Torchlight I, only dungeons within underground maps\n- Unlimited levels can result to crash if value stored become overflows.\n- Fully repetitive game : even all features included, illimited levels & dungeons, Fate is very repetitive. But because you'll get better stats/skills/items each time, you'll want to progress.\n\nAdding henchmen to help your main is awesome. But this Fate suffer from too many flaws about henchmen. I hope update will improve game and give to henchmen real power they need.\n\nIf you want to play solo this Fate you can buy it.\n\nIf you need perfect party within AI controlled you won't get perfect team you want.

Open the game directory and set the Compatibilty Mode to Windows XP (Service Pack 3)\n2. Locate the .dat file named "default_config.dat" and open it with Notepad\n3. Change the setting "FULLSCREEN" from "1" to "0" and save it\n4. Launch Fate: The Cursed King and it should work fine now\n\nThe only downside is that selecting the Fullscreen option crashes the game\nUPDATE - Do NOT select the "Fullscreen" option from the settings. It will make the game crash and retrying this method wont make it work anymore.\n\nMETHOD #2 - Results in a perfect fix but requires downloading some files.\n\n1. Head onto reshade.me and download the problem and save it to your desktop\n2. Extract it onto your desktop (or directory of your choosing)\n3. Open the extracted folder and double click on the Mediator.exe file\n4. On the left hand side, there will be a bar with the world "Add" next to it, click on "Add"\n5. You will need to navigate to your Fate.exe which is in C: > Program Files (x86) > Steam > steamapps > Common > Fate the Cursed King. Click on Fate.exe to add it to ReShade\n6. Make sure the mode below the bar is set to Direct3D 8\n7. Hit "Apply" at the top of the window and close everything out\n8.

I have Windows 10 and the game works just fine and I have had a lot of fun with this game. I played this long before I had even heard of Diablo or Torchlight and I still love this game even after playing both of them and other RPG games.

Nice job idiot!  Now your stupid self has to go venture into a dungeon to find this evil thing and kill it.\n\nFate: The Cursed King is the fourth and latest edition of Fate, originally created by Travis Baldree who later went on to create the highly-regarded Torchlight series.  This means the game is rather old and it did not release in Nov 2014 as Steam is reporting.  Unlike Fate: Traitor Soul, this does not contain the previous installments of the Fate series.\n\nCursed King is a top-down dungeon delver featuring you and a companion pet.  You choose between a human, shadow elf, half-orc, cogger, and imp; each starting with specialized weapon and magic skills.  You also get to pick a difficulty level and choose between a pet dog, cat, drone (bee), boar, fox, phoenix, or a frog-like creature called a strider to accompany you on your travels.  You start with 250 gold which can't buy much so Fate regulars know the best starting item to buy is a fishing pole.  By fishing, you can pick up various fish and occasionally weapons and gear.  Three different dungeons await.  You'll start in the Caverns of Living Fire where you can fish in lava.  Go figure.  You'll then have a Haunted Palace and the Crypt of T'Kala to complete.\n\nA couple of nice features separate this game from the original Fate.  Firstly, healing orbs are scattered about when you defeat enemies so you don't have to rely on health potions as much.  There are also training dummies to practice your skills on.  You won't see your DPS, but you'll see your damage with each strike to help decide on the best weapons and magic.  Along the way, you can collect cards that you can give to a mystic for bonuses.\n\nThe most notable change is being able to hire additional henchmen to accompany you in your travels.  The price seems a little much, at least when you start, but their skills and stats are displayed so you know what your are getting.  You can feed potions to your recruit to heal them and increase their stats as they level up but you also need to equip them with gear.  I've found this works great for a magic build since I can have my pet, recruit and any summoned monsters keep me away from damage while I cast spells.\n\nOn the negative side, the various merchants and questgivers you deal with are arranged in a giant circle around a lake.  It's a bit of walking to get to the person you need to since they're not as bunched up as they were in the city of Grove.  Also, you'll come across locked chests that will be impossible to open unless you have special keys in your inventory.  Keys are rarely found.  The corridors seem skinnier in this game and it's easy to get stuck if a large chest or an altar is in the way.  The altar in particular can be a source of frustration since may be asked to defend it from attacking monsters.  It's hard to do when you can't get around it.  According to the help file, there seemed to be a way of trading items to other players using a facebook account.  I don't use Facebook, but unless I'm missing something, this feature does not seem to be available in the Steam version.\n\nAside from increasing the resolution to 1920x1080, the graphics in this game have not changed since the original Fate, released in 2005. If you're looking for the most Fate games for your money, I suggest getting Fate: The Traitor Soul as it also contains Fate: Undiscovered Realms and the original Fate.  I've only played the original Fate, so I don't know how many of the features I listed show up in later games.  If you want the latest and greatest Fate with the improvement I listed, then Fate: The Cursed King is a worthy title on its own merits.","July 6, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When in game you can change it to fullsreen, but keep in mind you'll have to get into the config again and change fullscreen back to zero to start up the game again.\n\nFor my review: Great game. I love it to bits. I had the first FATE free on my first desktop I got when I was six in 2006 and I played it so much. Now, I do not like the finicky fishing, tis a bit of a pain, and the graphics are just, bleh! But I know I have to take it with a pinch of salt as it is an older game and made by a small group.
