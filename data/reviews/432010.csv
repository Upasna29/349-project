"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YuriLover/recommended/432010/","YuriLover","BigBossBalrog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YuriLover/","155 products in account","From what little i've played of this game, it seems very, very reminesent of the Harvest Moon games, specifcally Friends of Mineral Town for Gameboy, which is probaly one of my favorite hand held games ever. The game is very atmospheric so far, very charming too,  and the little details, like flower petals flowing in the wind, rabbits running around, and birds flying in the sky are much appreciated.\n\nThe sprites are very nice looking, and the game looks very appealing (for a RPG Maker game). The character potraits...I really like, but I can see why some people might be put off by them.\n\nThe music, is great as well. Very harvest moonish.\n\nCharacters are enjoyable so far. Rather large cast. (I think I read somewhere that they focused more on the writing then the gameplay). Charaters are written very well as well. Leauges better then Harvest Moon. Theres alot of unqiue dialouge as well. (All characters will comment on the weather, the day before a special event, the day after a special event, and more). While Harvest Moon seemed only to devolep it's marriable characters with heart events, alot of side characters are given the same treatment with heart event-esque events.\n\nFrom what little i've expierenced from the farming, it's slightly simplfied compared to Harvest Moon, but still very fun. I'll update this when I get to the mining, fishing, festivels and upgrading the farmstead.\n\nMining is...rather differnt then Harvest Moon (A good thing). Unlike Harvest Moon, you dont need a hoe to go down levels, instead the mine has set room (five in total).  While the further you go down, the harder it is to mine minerals, the better chance of aquiring high quality ones. Also, unlike Harvest Moon, you dont go gems you can sell right away. You need to proccess them first (at a special station right outside the mine). When you proccess them, you get a random gem stone, that you can sell (depending on the quality of the mineral you mined, your chances of getting low, mid, and high tier gems are increased, or descreased)\n\nYou can also choose the names for your animals, which was a nice little detail I loved in the Harvest moon games. Apparantley, you can also rename your farmstead later on in the game after gettinng a certain item, which is cool.\n\nProbaly my favorite aspect of the harvest moon series, is the courting parts, acting like a dating sim at times. Thankfully, it seems the devs have put effort into it. I've meet several differnt candiates so far, and it seems pursuing and romancing various ones, will add a good bit of repalaybility to the game (which the harvest moon games are known for), as the romance candiates personalities are all radically differnt.  One thing it surpasses its progenitor on, is the ability to romance the same gender (which is a feature the Harvest Moon fanbase has been clamoring for, for years). At the start when your making your own character, you get the option to choose which sex your attracted too.\n\nAfter being crushed by the disapointment that was Wild-Season, it seems we've finally gotten an excellent Harvest Moon-esque farming sim on Steam. Whole heardley recomend this to farming sim, Harvest Moon, and dating sim fans. Really excited to keep playing and explore the vast amounts of other aspects the game has to offer.","January 25","true","21.6"," 148 of 163 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","148","163","4","10"

Decided for a bit of honesty.\n\nIf people are being jerks and being 'go play stardew valley!' then they have a different harvest moon-esque playstyle than those that play this game. This game is adorable and aims more for the social aspect and imaginative characters that you look forward to spoiling with their favorite drinks. The festivals are adorable, the stories behind them is enough to make even a grown-♥♥♥ woman (I'm 27) squee like a teenager all over again. The festivals are interactive and there is one that would help you out immensely if you talk to everyone, as they give you valuable info for the event.\n\nYes, the developer is independant, but they are very active in helping people with their problems and on top of bug reports. That is an excessively big bonus for me. After hitting a terrible bug that made my game unplayable past a certain point, I posted in the forum, read others, and the developer kept on top of things, stating patches were coming and being very professional. Sure enough, my game is playable again and I am happily back to figuring which crops to plant and who to go make friends with.\n\nA very nice game to play when you just need a break from the heavy plots and drama of other games and real life. Sometimes, just gotta sit down, grow some tomatos, and share with others.\n\nStardew is more for those that enjoy profits and are more goal-oriented. By all means, play both, but never compare them.","March 10","true","15.9"," 104 of 107 people (97%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","97","104","107","6","0"

I've played Harvest Moon games since Harvest Moon 64. Harvest Moon 64 and Back to Nature on the PS1 were my favorite games in the series and I've truly loved the series for over 15 years. That said this game is the closest thing I've found "Other Harvest Moon games included" to recapturing the love I have for the series. If you enjoyed Harvest Moon 64 or Back to Nature I fully recommend this game. The only gripe I have so far with this game is the annoying sound that plays every few seconds while running as your energy goes down. In my opinion the sound should only occur when the health is getting dangerously low as the sound is quite annoying. Hopefully this is something the developer fixes and or removes or at least gives the option to turn off.","January 25","true","8.5"," 76 of 87 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","76","87","3","5"

After finishing the friendship grind on 3 villagers, the game seemed to reward me with... some random dialogue lines.\n- You can only bind the shovel and watering can. You cannot bind anything else like the brush or milking device or animal fodder. This makes the daily barn work quite nasty.\n\n\nIf you need a Harvest Moon on PC, this isn't what you want.

It is not a complicated game so if your coming in looking for a deep farming simulation or complex gameplay then you may want to look elsewhere. What the game does have in spades though is charm.\n\nYou start off as a new arrival to the town of Sugar Blossom. You have a small plot of farming land (20 tiles) as well as a barn that can hold 2 cows, a horse, and 4 chickens. On top of this you have a dog you start with and it is even possible to get a cat as well.\n\nThere is also fishing, gathering plants that grow around town, and mining, and mixing drinks/juice/sauces, and a local sport called lockball that you can partake in as well though it all remains fairly straightfoward and easy to understand.\n\nSo again not the most elaborate set up but enough to let you run your small farm and keep you busy as you progress through the seasons and the story while you learn about the history of the village and the spirits that keep it safe.\n\nBeyond this is the social aspect which is easily the largest portion of the game. There are 25+ other people in the town ranging from the local baker, an artist, the town mayor, the rancher, a priest, etc, etc and all of them have their own personality's, likes, and routines throughout the day, and you can develop friendship or even romance with some of them if you so deire.\n\nIt really makes you feel like part of a community as you go about your life in your new home.\n\nAside from all that each season that I've played so far (after 13 hours I've just started Summer) has a couple markets where the townsfolk gather to meet and sell some goods and two festivals such as a horse race, music festival, and a beach festival each with their own mini activity that you can participate in.\n\nAltogether as said the game absolutely nails the feel that you are in this small cheerful country community. It's not complex, it's not buried in deep mechanics for you to manage your life with. But it is a relaxing and enjoyable way to spend time provided your willing to sit back and go with the flow.\n\nIf your looking to manage a farm and make a ton of money from it and to see how quickly you can go from rags to riches this is likely not the game for you. However if you want the gaming equivalent of sitting on your front porch with a nice glass of lemonade and just relaxing and enjoying life for a bit, then I would by all means recommend giving this game a shot.","January 28","true","39.1"," 47 of 49 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","47","49","3","0"

I find the game to be very charming. World's Dawn reminds me of some of the older iterations of Harvest Moon, which imo, are some of the best. Unfortunately as I think about this game, I tend to think of all the things it could have done better, and although initially I wanted to recommend the game, I find myself doing the opposite.\n\nMy overview is:\nThe gameplay is incredibly basic and not in depth at all. The villagers are great and the social aspect is probably the only reason to play the game. Want details? Read Below\n\n**Gameplay\n\nThis game really only has to offer the bare basics when it comes to gameplay. For instance, there are only 10 crops in total with 2 farming plots (there was only 1 when the game was first released) and I find this isn't enough space for you to really be able to turn a profit from selling your produce. Maybe if there was a system in place like Harvest Moons star quality that would allow me to increase the value of my crops I wouldn't be complaining, but so far, there isn't. I just feel that although you live on a farm, you don't really have to ever use it. It wouldn't affect your gameplay at all. Some people might disagree for storyline purposes, but for that I am sure you can buy whats necessary and still move on with the storyline.\n\nMoving on, the simplicity continues when I realize there is almost no point to any of the activities you can do.. Everything is just there so you can sell it. You may be wondering, what's the problem with that? Well, I won't go over every little thing, but let me explain:\n\n\nMining- I guess I would of liked to see some kind of crafting system, or maybe some things you need from the mine to upgrade your house.. anything really that would give it more of a reason to exist. Just about the only thing I like about mining is that I don't have to depend on RNG to upgrade my tools like a traditional HM.\n\nAnimals/Cooking - Only cows and chickens (1 horse), which means only eggs and milk. This is fine I suppose, but it would be nice to have more options. My real gripe with this, is that there is nothing to do WITH those eggs and milk. This ties into some of the produce as well... There are a few recipes you can make yes, but why can't I make butter? bread? anything that might use these basic ingredients that I have been harvesting. Instead I have to go buy these things from the bakery even though I am producing them from my own farm! It makes no sense and it's probably my number one issue. For Example: If I am cooking something that requires bread I can turn my wheat into flour, but I can't in turn use my flour to make that bread, I must buy it from the bakery.\n\nMaybe this isn't a problem for some people, but for me I was really expecting something a little more in depth than Step 1: harvest, Step 2: sell. Which is what all the activities in the game more or less boil down to.\n\n(OH and I hate lockball.. No particular reason I just don't find it a fun thing to do in the game).\n\n***Story and Villagers\n\nThe story itself is fine, in fact its probably more in depth than your average HM game. I like how most events that are celebrated throughout the year are connected to the storyline, really creates a lovely lore for the game. My only problem with this is that every year I have to listen to Amber explain to me in length why it is we celebrate each event as though I haven't celebrated it before. A bit of an oversight I think.\n\nVillagers dialogue actually changes quite a bit, which is refreshing. The villagers are probably the only reason I liked this game so much. For once I actually enjoyed going around town and talking to each person to learn a bit more about them.\n\nOne negative I would say is the Bachelor/Bachelorette options. Personally I didn't really like any of them, there were far more interesting people in town that I wished I could have married instead. This seems to be a complaint that many people are having.\n\nI found that after year 1, unless you were really slow about doing the Feral Shades quests.. there is nothing left to do. No point in playing the game by then unless you are someone that wants to collect everything (and if you are it can easily be done by the end of year 1/early year 2 if you know what it is you need to do)\n\n***Bugs\n\nI dealt with 3 different bugs in my playthrough, thankfully none of them were gamebreaking, but when I look at the community hub discussions there seem to be a lot of different issues happening to people, some of which ARE gamebreaking.\n\nMine were as follows:\n-There was a point in time when I couldn't send my dog out to do errands anymore. I have no idea why, the dialogue would just reset asking me where I wanted to go.\n\n-After marrying Hunter, a weird phantom of him was always in the carpentry shop. I could talk to him and gift him as if he was the real Hunter. When Hunter was working at the shop, both of them would be standing there. This I actually found kind of funny.\n\n-During the first LockBall Bash, after defeating the mystery player Bloom said "OK time to clean up!" and I was kicked out of East Village. No reward for winning the tournament, and no Mark Journal/Steam achievement.. I had to wait until year 2 to try again, when I entered East Village the day of the event I was immediately asked if I wanted to rematch the mystery player. I ofc said yes and after defeating him again I was finally able to unlock the achievement and stay to talk to the villagers after the event. I am still not 100% sure if this was intentional but to me it seemed weird and I didn't like that I had to wait a whole year to try again.\n\n***In Conclusion\n\nSo that's it.. my long winded review of a game. Let me say again that even though I am leaving a negative review about all the things I dislike, I did enjoy it, and I would say that it was worth my money. I really just wish it had more to do and was a bit more polished overall. Who knows, the dev seems to be very willing to listen to what the community has to say and is working on updates, so maybe in the future this review will be obsolete.. I hope that's true because I feel like this game COULD be a real gem with some tweaking here and there.","February 9","false","42.9"," 53 of 68 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","53","68","2","0"

The dev is really cool - he remains active on the forums, he even put out a personal fix for me when I reported a bug. He wants to continue adding more content to the game, and will more likely do that if there are more sales. I'll say this - if you've finished Stardew Valley and want to try something similar, totally check out World's Dawn.","March 13","true","13.3"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","0"

There is very little, if any hand-holding... you're dropped into the environment with a couple pointers and a relatively simple 'Find and Talk to Everyone' quest, then you're off exploring. The first couple days may be spent just figuring things out through trial and error, especially if you aren't familiar with games like Harvest Moon, or the standard RPGMaker keybindings (which you can change, but if you already are familiar with them it makes sense to leave them be).\n\nOnce you know what you're doing, the farming aspects are extremely straightforward with no deviation. Most of your time will be spent running around finding people to talk to, or preparing for whatever the next upcoming social event is. Like most games with dialogue, eventually you're going to exhaust the conversation options and there is going to be some repeating until you do something noteworthy, or there is a festival, or you've grinded out the next friendship level.\n\nMaking money in the game is easy, the hardest thing, interestingly, is the social ladder grind - trying to become friends with everyone. There is much more focus on the social than on the farming / mining / fishing / ranching... so if that's your cup of tea, check it out. All the other activities are there, of course, they are just relatively simple when compared to making friends.\n\nAll in all, it is a good game, and I consider the purchase money well spent. I woulnd't go so far as to say I'm totally engrossed with it, but it's definitely keeping me entertained.\n\nInstead of "just one more turn...", with this game it's "just one more day...".","January 29","true","35.1"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","26","29","0","0"

It is something that HM fans have wanted forever, but they refuse to give us because blah blah blah *insert stupid personal bias against gays here*.\n\n+ World's Dawn has actual good writing.

The characters often ended up flat and boring or you could completely disect them within the first few minutes of playing. I don't really feel that way about the characters in World's Dawn, I enjoy stopping and talking to some characters and they have so much more to say still.\n\nThough with any game it has flaws, though my flaw choices are more nitpicky than anything else and don't effect gameplay in any real negative way.\n\n- I do agree with another reviewer here that the sound effect for losing energy is going to drive me absolutely insane real fast when it comes to running.\n\n- The field is a bit smaller than what I'd like, but so you all know there is a "secret field" somewhere in the game that gives you more space, not sure how much as I don't think anyone has found it yet.\n\nWell, thats all I'm really going to post, I already have enough text for people to scim through.\n\nTL;DR\nCompletely recommend, amazing game, worth the price.

Overall I'm enjoying the game, though I have some gripes that I'll be focusing on.\n\nFirstly, with a cast so large, it is difficult to keep track of all the characters. Moreso, their names. You're given a quest to meet and greet, and from there are given a primer booklet on all the Villagers, their likes and dislikes, and their Affection level. But even after that, remembering names is a bit difficult. Having a name tag alongside the text boxes would go a long way to ensuring players quickly begin to associate the names with the characters.\n\nSecondly, the control bindings have NO context. I'm playing with an X-Box 360 Controller, and while it's working just fine, rebinding keys without knowing what each button does is a hassle. A more robust controls menu is a neccessity in my eyes.\n\nThirdly, I'm playing full screen on a 1920x1080 monitor, and while it upscales alright, I'm noticing what I think is so minor stretching. It may just be me, but I thought it was an important note. Another small note is, with as great as the character portraits are, I wish they weren't so pixelated at my resolution. Again, they seem to upscale decently, but I wish they looked cleaner.\n\nLastly, I just wanted to address a couple core issues I have with the game.\n- The amount of farmland you start will become a bit restrictive. I know some people have probably harped on this already, but I feel it needs to be said that there should be more. I'm inheriting this legendary farmer's land, and this is all the space he's got to plant? Even if I can't use it all at first, I feel there should be more to it.\n- The marriage options are a bit weak. Three girls to choose from is a bit shallow a pool, by this genre's standards, and there are a few women that I was surprised to find weren't available. Some of this comes to preference; many of the older women I find more attractive than the choices we currently have. Still, I'd prefer more options. If I had to be specific, the Nurse, Postwoman, and Artist were three women I was shock weren't courtable.\n- There's a complete lack of tension throughout interactions. Most characters are more than happy and friendly to interact with, and though some characters claim others to be gruff, they're really not. Beyond that, character scenes so far don't really introduce anything but fluff. I get that the game wants to be very "feel-good", but it feels a bit flat that all characters seem to respond to you and others with a general cheerfulness or friendliness.\n- Though for the moment there seems to be a greater plot line, without more sidequest-esque content, I'm worried about having things to do to keep invested in the game. If the sole objective is bonding with everyone to their max level, I'm not interested in doing that solely through a constant barrage of gifts. Or at the very least, without some objectives to do between.\n\nNow despite my criticisms, I'm enjoying milling around the game, taking part in festivals and soaking in all that the game has to offer initially. How long that will last, I can't say. For the current asking price, I'm not sure that, say, 5-10 hours of milling around this pretty, fluffy world is worth it. But if the game finds ways to continue to engage me, I'd be more inclined to call the game worth the price to play.","January 27","true","19.0"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","0"

First impressions of the game so far are really good and I'm really looking forward to playing more.  I'm also really happy to see a game like this come out on steam.   I used to play the heck out of Harvestmoon on the 64 and then HM Back to Nature on the PS1 so I really enjoy games like this where you can just sit back and play.\n\nMy only gripe so far is there is no real controller support, and I would really like to see them get that into the game.  Official 360 controller doesn't respond and there doesn't seem to be an option to change your directional controls in the options.  Also, there are only 3 marriage candidates of the opposite gender, which is by no means a deal breaker...just wish there was more variety so to speak. :)\n\nLong story short, congrats to devs of the game and I wish them the best and ask them to keep up the good work!!

This isn't inherently bad, but it does make liking the game hinge on how much someone enjoys Harvest Moon features and the quirks that come with them.\n\nThe dialog feels like a Harvest Moon game- a bit less repetitive, sure, but it still has the same RPG telling-in-dialog feeling. Two specific interactions immediately come to mind. One of the more frequent ones is a character frequently reiterating their relationship to another one in a way that feels forced and unnatural, like a mother constantly referring to "Bloom, my son," even though the relationship was already introduced. Another is the one-off one-liners about a character's past, like the mailwoman commenting she was orphaned. It's a quirk of Harvest Moon writing systems that carries over here, and while it's endearing due to nostalgia, it isn't exactly good.\n\nThe characters themselves are endearing if a bit shallow, where their main development is through small dialogs between two different characters, or festival romance events. The romance events do feel very natural, especially compared to most of the game, but aren't very frequent. Characterization for potential spouses is limited due to that, without the standard Harvest Moon heart event fanfare.\n\nFarming is similarly streamlined, with a limited amount of progression available. There's a balance to place between making farming unmanageable or making it too simple, and the game leans heavily toward the latter. You can increased your crop field through a rather lengthy and unintuitive process, but by the time you can unlock that you may not need the extra money. Because farming is so streamlined, progression can feel non-existent. Unfortunately, this is compounded with how easy it is to buy out the store's products by the end of the first year. Raising animals fairs better. You're caped at two cows and four chickens, but since animals are costly and take longer to start producing products, this doesn't suffer from the same feeling of non-progression.\n\nThe aspects World's Dawn improves upon the standard Harvest Moon formula are the forging system, the cooking system, and house and character customization. Forging has two main aspects; finding wild produce on the ground, and collecting ingredients in a bottle. The ingredients is new and it works well, especially combined with the much better cooking system. Cooking is split into mixing and dishes. Mixing requires the bottle ingredients, and you have to remember the recipes for those. These mixes only take two ingredients, so experimenting and remembering isn't taxing. Cooking takes more ingredients, but you are required to have a recipe for larger dishes. This balances experimenting and recipes well, and makes cooking much less about finding a guide online with all the recipes and more about experimenting a little and collecting recipes throughout town.\n\nAs stated before, house and character customization is charming and done well, if a bit limited. Though most of the outfits aren't available until after marriage, mixing and matching different clothing items works well and looks nice. Housing fairs similarly, though housing items are available earlier in the game. It's small changes, but they work well. The additional mini-games are also fun, if a bit simple at times, but a nice change of pace.\n\nDespite characters having similar or worse development as compared to previous Harvest Moons, the main plot line works much better than Harvest Moon's standard Harvest Goddess fanfare. The progression in the story is paced well, and the unlocks for progression are rewarding.\n\nOverall, the game is still enjoyable- to those looking for a Harvest Moon experience. It can feel pretty barebones due to streamlining, though this does benefit the pacing of the game as it's faster and less reliant on artificial time-wasting unlocks. However, I don't think it quite makes up for it in writing, which is on par to some of the better installments in the Harvest Moon series. It's still a solid game that captures Harvest Moon well, but it unfortunatly doesn't do enough to capture Harvest Moon without its problems.","January 29","true","27.4"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

Before I state such this is coming from someone who has not played a ton of harvest moon games, but has always found them very fun ideas and enjoyed the time I did play them. So far I am very very pleased with World's Dawn, I have found there are many things the game seems to do well, with a very small list of things that are a tad annoying,but far from game breaking.\nThe good things are the attention to detail throughtout the game, from the music in certain areas, or when it rains, or thunderstorm, theres a wonderful soundtrack thats joined together. The added little things like birds flying around, or little animals in the forest areas running about, really gives the game a wonderful feeling as you play.\n\nNow I will say the Harvest Moon elements don't seem to shine as bright as some of he reviews I have seen, there are certainly elements here. You can farm, have you own animals, but I can't help but feel its simply an aspect of the game and not the core element. Im fine with this, but I think it should be noted so that some HM vets don't come in thinking it'll be the same thing they are used to, it wont be; I think I can safely say, but the feel is there. I can't help but feel along with this HM basics intergrated in that I also get a feel of certain Animal Crossing elements as well, which I'd say is a good thing. A lot of early focus is on meeting people in game, visiting the shops, seeing who's open and who is closed on what days. The game makes you take some time to get use to where you'll be running to and from on a day to day basis. I found this to be a good thing since doing pretty much anything is all at your own pace. I have yet to feel I had to do something or be somewhere, I just kind of pick what I want to spend the day doing, and I do it.\n\nOne of the things a lot of people are talking about is the EN bar(your stamina bar) which is used by sprinting, mining, watering plants, pretty much anything that doesnt involve simply walking. At the time being it is used very quickly, almost too quickly. This is an issue the dev is aware of and has noted will potentially be adjusting soon, so while it willl be something youd notice quickly as a potential problem, be mindful its something being looked at and hopefully improved soon enough.\n***(EDIT- This has already been updated with a small patch, the constant sound effect while sprinting has been removed, and the amount of EN used while sprinting has been cut in half. Two issues already addressed and fixed!)***\n\nSo bottom line, I def do recommend this game, I have really been enjoying it a lot. Its a simply, calming, relaxing game to play if thats what your looking for. I know I was and have been absolutley pleased with the purchase. An absolute steal for the price.","January 26","true","13.9"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","15","18","2","0"

This game removes the tedious and overly complicated farming from some of the newer Harvest Moon games and gets right back to the basics.  It even adds some of the best features from early Harvest Moon games too: mini games.  Things like swimming or horseback riding or dancing at festivals that makes it more then just a random gathering.   Plus an actual story again.  It feels like its been forever since there was lore and objective and incentive to continue to play.\n\nThe game has its flaws yeah but its enjoyable overall and worth the money considering it costs a fraction of some of the subpar HM games.","February 17","true","27.9"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

I never before had played any games of this kind, since I don't really like farming or any other management games, but this one called out to me with its relationship building system and a small friendly village with cute art style and very nice atmosphere.\n\nI warn you - for me this isn't actually a farming game. You know, it has farming aspect, but this just isn't so important for me personally. I guess, it's okay, even if kinda repetitive.\n\nWell, about that. The game is kinda repetitive - you tend to your farm, you go fishing or mining, you talk to villagers and then go to sleep. It could be boring, but it isn't, surprisingly. Weather changes, some new things happen, meeting with your neighbours is actually fun! Maybe, it will get boring after like, four game years. Or maybe it's just me and my undying love for good game characters.\n\nI like characters in this game a lot - they all are interesting, different, very friendly people with great dialogues. I love to interact with them, even if just listening to basic "Thanks for the gift". And yes, giving a lot of similar gifts to one person each day can be kinda boring, but it's also funny to me. When I imagine my character with hundreds of villagers' favorite drinks, running around village and giving gifts to everyone... It's hilarious. I have a good imagination.)\n\nSo, yes. It is an interesting little game with gorgeous writing and a little repetitive gameplay, ideal for people like me, who loves to dive deep into story and not to grow tons of things to sell. And I love cats here. They're adorable. And yes, did I mention this beautiful art style and magnificent music?\n\n'kay, I said my word and I just want to recommend this game for those who loves stories and characters more than gameplay. Have a nice day!\n\nPS: obviously, I played it way more than just five minutes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/riolis/recommended/432010/","riolis","Riolis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/riolis/","961 products in account","This game is just a huge dissapointment for me.\n\nA HM insipired game, where you can only have 10 type of crops, 2 cows and 4 chicken, and can't do anything with stuff you farmed aside from gifting, using in very limited cooking and its very limited recipe or selling it. And cooking is another pain as most of the other ingredient you need to buy and can't get it anywhere either by exploring nor crafting, so Farming AND Livestock are mainly pointless in this game unless you wanted to get achievement or progress the story-line.\n\nA HM insipired game where, most of the time you will be spending is in the form of mining. This is where you get the most dosh, by spending time clicking Spacebar/Z non stop on rocks in this two tiered RNG nightmare. (Once when you hit the boulder and once when refinening the rocks) In this game its mining where your main income comes from, and farming/livestock is your sub income. Though neither mining nor farming is any fun to play with.\n\nThere is no depth in the gameplay, no leveling up your crops or cows/chicken, or your mining skill/chances, no fruit tree planting, no fish breeding, no bees+honey, no mushroom farming, no nothing nada. Just a very boring click fest, and an inventory that are unintuitive to use. Just a mindless boring grind with no essense to it.\n\nFurthermore you can't even expand your barnyard or farm lot. sigh. If there is, the game sure didn't even try to tell me about it. But I guess it's probably best not to expand anyways, as the proccess of farming or caring for livestock is a HUGE PAIN, as you can't put stuff that you used the most in the quickslot, and have to use the super annoying inventory every time to grab somehting out to feed your dog/car/cow/chicken.\n\nAnother gripe I have with this game is character moves way too slowly, and running will use up your energy. The map is pointlessly bigger then it should be with nothing much interesting in between and it will take forever for you to walk from one end to another to find the NPC you want to find (which brings me to another problem, no minimap and locations of NPC), But you can get a horse you say? Sure, but you can't talk while your char is transform as a horse, you need to untransform to human, and later transform back to horse, which force you to sit there for few second every single time watching the bloody annoying fade in fade out transition. Imagine doing this a number of time while you are on your way to the town and meet up with a few NPC along the way.\n\nThe story is also very plain, and pretty much boring. The romantic interest that are presented to you also have very boring lines and very uninteresting as a character. Charming characters? Sure, there are a few, but your romatic interest are very generic and "ughh". For example, Hailey only have 1 event in the whole game, and it doesn't even shows her personality, just a very boring dialog/talk with her father. No personality at all. The story is probably better then most of the olden HM games, but unfortunately this game falls on it @sses when compared to the newer iteration of HM like HM new beginnings. Futhermore after marriage, there is nothing new your bride can provide you except for a small amount of dosh. I would rather they have more story after marriage and make all the running around to talk to her and collecting mushroom and gifting it to her worthwhile. But unfortunately it's not. Very dissapointing.\n\nFishing is horrible. :/\n\nLockball is even more horrible :/\nThe control is a nightmare, sure. Even then the difficulty ramp is just out of whack. Every character you played with is very easy even with the horrid control, but then when the tournament came, and you fight with Paxel, the difficulty curve just went through the roof as you will bang your keyboard non stop and flipping any table you can find in your field of view.\n\n\n\nIn summary, this game tries to do what HM do well, but falls flat in every way possible.\nBut two thumbs up for the character drawings. Props to the artist (Ivyree Rosario)\n\nThe game as a whole is meh.","February 14","false","16.1"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","16","25","0","0"

That's not to say that there aren't problems, but that's the nature of the beast, isn't it?\n\nFirst of all, you can choose from a male or female farmer, then choose whether you want to narrow your potential love interests down to Men, Women, or Both right on the character creation screen. There could be more options for hair styles and such, like hair color, but what is given in the creator is acceptable and looks very much like a Harvest Moon protagonist.\n\nOne problem with the game is the Energy Bar, which will deplete extremely quickly if you try and sprint everywhere. The bar also depletes when you do some activities such as digging or planting and watering crops. It's fairly easy to manage, though, and you can refill the bar to full once a day by bathing in the hotspring, or you can just take in some food and drink at any table to restore your energy. Another issue is a small amount of lag on certain maps that not everyone is experiencing, so that's something to account for, by no means game breaking of course.\n\nThe villagers are all very well written and the portraits are quite nice, I find myself wandering around the town after tending to my crops just to see what everyone has to say. Which, to be honest, is half of the point to this kind of game, it's a life simulation.

I've been a long time fan of the Harvest Moon series and have longed for a HM game for PC. Not only does this game satisfy that want, it exceeded my expectations for it. This game has charm and whimsy, making it a wonderful game to spend a few hours playing at the end of a long game. The controls can take a moment to get used to, but they're pretty intuitive for someone familiar with HM games. But perhaps my favorite thing in the game is the fact that it asks you at the very beginning of the game whether you'd like to romance men, women, or both- regardless of the player character.\n\nThis game is a lot of fun, and I am very much looking forward to mining, fishing, raising animals, and farming my way through this game. I highly recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of HM.","February 27","true","10.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Doesn't feel generic although it is definitely a low-budget production.\n\nThe writing is very "Harvest Moon"--you're plopped in the town with no real intro or background on your character, just "you're here!  now go talk to people!"  Everyone is so aggressively cheery and nice that I'm trying to fight off the suspicion that there's a "dark secret" under the surface as so many indie games now seem prone to do.\n\nMovement is slow, and dashing consumes energy.  You'll probably run down most of your energy bar just running to the other side of the map.  This isn't great, since this is a game where you want to run around and talk to everyone every in-game day, like in Harvest Moon or Rune Factory.  You can't get anywhere you want to go promptly, which is frustrating if you go all the way to the other side of the map and there isn't anyone there to talk to anyway.  The developer has posted saying they'll be addressing the movement speed/endurance drain issues shortly.\n\nLot's of cute little touches, like a fishing minigame, feeding your dog every day, whistling to call him to you, some mining that I haven't tried yet--I've spent the first four or five in game days just exploring everything and talking the people, and I haven't even gotten to the farming yet!\n\nIt doesn't seem like a revolutionary game from what I've played so far, but if you're craving some more Harvest Moon-style gameplay, I don't think you can go wrong grabbing it for 10-12 bucks.","January 26","true","1.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

It's very similar to games like Harvest Moon with just enough differences here and there to feel like a unique experience. There's a wide assortment of characters here and learning about their personalities and relationships to one another is a true joy. While the days will move by very quickly, the pace of the game is quite lax and you are free to take your time exploring. Though you run a farm, there are actually many ways to earn money. From mining, to fishing, even to playing soccer! The mini-games are refreshing and are an example of what I truly enjoy about this game. The surprises. The small cutscenes or mini-games that catch you by surprise and are all the more enjoyable for it. The music is very relaxing and no matter how long I listen to it I never grow tired of hearing it. The developer also seems to be very responsive as, only a little over 24 hours after release, they seem to have removed the annoying sound that plays when you sprint AND reduce the energy that is expended when sprinting. This was my only gripe with the game and it's already been fixed! I definitely recommend this game for anyone who even remotely enjoys games such as Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing, or other relaxing town games.","January 26","true","29.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

I'm only about 2 hours in, but its caputred the essense of old school Harvest Moon games just like Friends of Mineral Town. I do not know what the late game is like, if there even is one. (often times Harvest Moon games just go on forever) but you have a very high level of customization thats presented very openly the moment you walk in the first store. (theres many stores each selling a large veriety of things that you -want- to buy, if you also enjoy the Animal Crossing thing.\n\nThe townsfolk are various and each can be found in set locations each day. Farming is a little rough during these few opening hours, you dont have many farming plots and your watering can only holds 8 squares before going dry, but there are ways to upgrade it i found. Im not sure if the size of your farming plot increases however.\n\nI heartily reccomend this game, dont let the RPG maker stigma throw you, its every bit Harvest Moon nostalgia that I've been so longing for.","January 27","true","2.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

I and many others were complaining about how sprinting took so much EN, and one day later he patched it. That made me feel pretty good about this game.\n\nYou probably notice immediately that it's an RPGMaker game, and that RPGMaker games have a sort of reputation. Well, luckily, this is one of the handful of "worthwhile games" made with this engine.\n\nIf you've ever played a Bokujou Monogatari (Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons) game and thought, "I wish there was more unique dialogue" or "I wish there was more of a story" then this game is for you. There are "quests" for you to complete such as making a hot stew for the old man with a cold, along with a "trading game" of sorts where you find someone who can use an old item.\n\nThe festivals are also much more engaging. You actually *do* something, besides just entering your stuff in a contest, or simply showing up at the right place at the right time.\n\nAll of these things kept me coming back for more.","January 29","true","10.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Great game for unwinding and grinding (heh).\n\nTo the developers, fabulous job, but I STRONGLY reccomend a map feature that can be carried by the player as the landscape can get confusing at times since a lot of it looks similar. I spend more time trying to figure out where I am and searching desperately for map signs than anything else. A larger or expandable farm plot would be more rewarding as well. These limitations do remind us that it is an indie game and improving them would give it a more polished feel.\n\nOverall, great game for those of us who wanted a less grindey, more engaging Harvest Moon.","January 28","true","38.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

This is one of those rare ones where some real work and dedication went into it. The artstyle is adorable. The minigames are fun. The villagers dialogue seems to be extensive and varied so far which is great because I get so bored with some Harvest Moons only having a few things to say per season. The music's great and the little sound effects are cute. There also seems to be some character customization because you can change your clothes at this thing at your house. I ain't got any clothes yet but I can get naked at it so that's a plus. Also you can be gay in this game which is great.\n\nThe one issue I have though is the walking speed feels slightly too slow for my taste and to sprint you have to use your EN (stamina) bar and it depletes really quickly and makes an annoying noise every time it goes down bit by bit, but hopefully this will be addressed in a future patch. It's really a minor thing.","January 26","true","40.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I've already spent my whole morning playing, and can tell that I will continue playing for a long time. The art and storylines are captivating, the music can get a little annoying, but it is still beautiful music.\n\nI very much look forward to getting married, acheiving a stabile income, and getting to know each and every townsperson.\n\nOne thing I will add, the character customization is not very in-depth, but I think the option to choose your sexual orientation is very nice. It cuts flirting with the other gender if you are just not interested in them.\n\nOverall, I think the game is a 10/10, and was captivated from the very beginning.\n\nBig Props to the developer and look forward to seeing what else you have in store for us!","January 29","true","23.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The character portaits and dialogue are well done. The minigames are... not perfect, but present (and I am actually a sucker for minigames). Fishing can be tedious without a net (one fish per hour), and mining is definitely reliant on a lot of luck (and it eats away at your stamina like crazy). But both are done in a pretty concise manner.\n\nThere aren't too many romance options [3 male, 3 female], but the fact that your character's gender does not exclude them from marriage candidates is a nice bonus. And from the way this game looks, it's possible future updates will change that.\n\nOverall, I think it was well worth the price. I came in looking for something similar to Harvest Moon, and I found a lot of familiar territory presented in a way that improved a lot of what I didn't like about Harvest Moon. The ability to take on part-time jobs to make money is helpful - especially in the early game. The book you recieve from your first quest makes tracking your relationships far less stressful. The option to change clothes is cute. Plus, there's actual plot. So, that's kind of nice.

I really like the characters too and interacting with a lot of them (especially the bachelors hurhurhur) and the gameplay is great and relaxing. I know some people complained about the field you start with (20 squares) and how small it is but for now it isn't really a problem for me at all and later on you'll unlock another field anyways so your farm definitely does get bigger. My main focus right now is collecting stuff aka hoarding, interacting with the villagers, mining, fishing, part-time jobs (I love the part-time job feature! great way for earning money and building relationship with the whole family) so it definitely isn't a problem for me atm since I just use it for cooking/missions. The festivals are SO fun too! I love that they all have fun mini-games which make them so much more entertaining then the harvest moon festivals. I also really like the whole lockball game feature, I really sucked at first but I quickly got the hang of things and its become really fun and another great way of making some money when I wanna play against someone. I also feel more connected to my dog in this then in harvest moon games. I love how the pup could do errands for you and the villagers comment about our cute lil pup when we take 'em out for walks.\n\nOverall the characters aren't bland, art is great, mini-games are fun, very addicting, and it fills that harvest moon void! the only complaint I had was the energy wasting too quickly but its pretty much fixed in the new update~\n\nso I'll give this game .. 5 stars now that the whole stamina thing is fixed. (also I need to mention how romantic the story behind the Misty Music festival is! it made me think long and hard about who I wanted to dance with) I hope this review is helpful to the people thinking of buying this game and really makes them consider whether they want it or not. EDIT: added some more stuff I forgot to mention and fixed some errors.","January 27","true","32.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/themintpen/recommended/432010/","themintpen","The Mint Pen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/themintpen/","236 products in account","A wonderful game for fans of the Harvest Moon series. World's Dawn is a beautiful game with a very interesting and (so far) likeable cast of characters. As in the HM fashion your character starts out with a farm that hasn't had an owner for a while in a small village, and it's up to you to liven things up again. There are festivals and different random events that happen and while the main plot of the game has yet to reveal all of itself to me, it's safe to say I'm excited to see what will happen.\n\nThe mechanics are so far a lot simpler that what you may go in expecting. Take farming for example, instead of a huge field that you have to clear out and will possibly never fill with crops and flowers, you have a small twenty plot field for your crops. There is also a simple mining and refining system, fishing took a few tries to get used to but it is also rather fun as well. The most annoying mechanic of the game would probably be how running reduces your precious endurance meter by a lot. Now, that wouldn't be such an issue if walking didn't feel so slow and the map felt so big. Perhaps walking will not but such a chore later in the game once I learn the map and increase said endurance meter.\n\nOther than that tiny little critism so far, this game is very enjoyable. I would say the price it very fair for the amount of content and potential playtime you are getting. There are different things that make it stand apart from the Harvest Moon series itself, but it definitely feels like a love letter to the good old days of the farming simualtor series.","January 27","true","27.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Now before you get excited, I'm referring to the amazing social interactions. There's defiantly more depth within the characters, the conversations can be longer and the shift between friend, close friend and partner is also well presented in the dialogue. Now after gushing about how awesome the social interactions are, there are some downfalls, I would of liked a better gradient with the skills, and maybe more options with the animals (turning milk to butter/cheese etc).  However, I did like the cooking concept (you can't cheat here boys and girls :P Only the recipe's you learn can be cooked ;) ).

To me, that is the fun part.  Not to mention the cool artwork too.\nReading through some of the other reviews/discussions, I see that the dev has stayed very engaged and interested in what the players are saying.

After watching some online play, and reading some descriptions of the game, I decided to purchase the game.\nAfter 10 or so days in game I started to question if I was just missing some other game components. After looking up some of the content of the game online, I realized there wasn't much more than I had already found. A handful of crops you can grow, a dozen or so recipes used to woo or befriend the citizens. You can go mining and get one of 4 possible valuable stones. I must have missed where fishing was explained in-game. My few attempts at fishing yielded nothing and never proved to be an intuitive activity. The home decorations I saw in the various shops were not enticing to ever buy even if I had the money. You can forage for items around town, but that felt more like a mechanic built in to do while traveling from one end of town to the other.\nI will say the graphics are decent for the aesthetic the developers seems to be going for.","January 31","false","2.8"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

HORRIBLE.\nThe NPCs get so many advantages, it's not cool.\nI'm not even far in the Lockball stuff yet, but I absolutely hate it. So much so that I'm pondering whether or not putting it as not recommended. It's so frustrating. A mini-game like this should be fairly easy to get into, be fun, and not make you want to rip the hair off of your head.\nAlright, but enough complaining, here's what I don't like about it:\n1. It's too sensitive. You're all over the screen, it's very hard to get a target on the ball, and it's even harder to navigate it across the field. It's nearly impossible with a fast opponant. It's like you're sliding around, never really getting solid ground. Lockball should be challenging, not super infuriating. And if I have to spend everyday of World's Dawn trying to do these stupid Lockball games until I actually get somewhat good, then it's not even worth it to play Lockball. Think about this; if you've just started playing soccer, do you slide all over the field? No, if anything, you've got slower reflexes, and yyou might be slower.\n2. The NPCs can do this little thing where they can drag the ball over a space with them as they move. You can't do that, so if you get it stuck next to the wall, you basically have to give it to the opponent, and then, if it's a fast opponent, they get it into the goal pretty easily. You have to go to the other side of the ball to push it left or right on the field, (which with the too sensitive controls makes it even harder) and with that, it takes too long to react, and if you've got a fast opponent, it's stolen from you super quickly.\n3. Locking the goal. I have no idea how the NPCs do this, but if you have the ball in the goal, and they're still behind you (about halfway through the field), they can still lock the goal even though they're no where near it, and you have the ball in the goal already. And I don't know if lower level players can't do this yet, but you can't lock the goal. Even if you're in it, they're right in front of you, and definitely not the way the NPCs can. I've played games against lower-level opponents, and they can still do all these things I'm writing about.\n4. The opponents can jump behind the ball. If it's behind them, and you've pushed it behind them, they can just jump behind it and steal it away from you. Again, you can't do this. It's not cool. I get that since you're new to Lockball, you wouldn't be able to all the cool stuff the more experienced players can do, but giving tons of advantages to the NPCs that you don't have isn't fair either.\nOK, enough rant. I just HATE the stupid Lockball. I'm at the tournement, and I keep losing to Paxel, which I would accept, except there's so many things getting in my way, the over-sensitivity, him being able to drag the ball, lock the goal from halfway across the field, and being able to jump behind the ball and steal it.\n\nThings I liked, and are the only reasons I'm giving it recommended:\n1. Likeable characters (Wished they gave me chat options or something to do with the villagers throughout the day. Literally, you just say, "hi" then it's basically over interaction wise, until the next day, where you again, only say, "hi".)\n2. Nice surroundings\n3. Really cute festivals and things (Except that Lockball tournament ARRGH)\n4. Cute doggo\n5. Interesting storylines (Feel like it's kinda forcing me to do stuff though)\n6. I don't know why, it's just really addicting (I mostly just like the romance storylines, but I like the rest of the game too.)\n7. I like the whole cooking thing (Although I feel it's really hard to get ingredients, especially carrots and garlic if you haven't even made it to that season yet)\nOverall, I like the game, JUST HATE THE STUPID LOCKBALL. I recommend the game, hope the creator thinks about some of the suggestions of mine, forgives me for that little outburst, and don't touch the Lockball if you're like me...\n\n(It's not good for your health...)","February 23","true","33.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game remembers what you do and applies it to everything you do (ex: if you get married, the game will remember and your dialogue with characters will change slightly based on that).\nThe game is also a good mix between difficult and easy, which I really appreciate.\n\nThe only two complaints I have about this game is that the library doesn't really work and I can't read any books there (although I don't know if it's supposed to be like this) and that I want my character to be able to have kids (if we can, I haven't played long enough to lol).\n\nBut overall, this game is incredible, and I can't recommend it enough!","May 9","true","119.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's all I've been playing when I have a spare moment.  It has that Harvest Moon feel but I feel like the story and the writing is much better then what the Harvest Moon series has had since my two favorite games HM: Tree of Tranquility/Animal Parade; plus this game brings the part-time working to get money and raise relationships back onto the table (A feature I liked in ToT).\n\nI like the writing, it feels natural.  I really enjoy the history and was surprised to actually see cut scenes for when someone is telling me about the past history of the town.\n\nThe gameplay isn't too hard considering (though the Lockball compition finals game for the first year kicked my butt like no tommorrow) but I've been playing HM games for years but its nice to see the creator make changes/add a tutorial for people who need help. (And that second field was a godsend).\n\nI like both sides of the marriage spectrum, and I'm not ashamed to admit that the fact I can play as gay/bisexual in this game is the main reason I even looked into this game in the first place.  That was one of the things I really wanted in Harvest Moon but knew that they'll never do so I'm extremly happy and relived to be able to do that here.  The boys and girls are intresting, though some more then others but of course, like in any HM/Rune Factory game I play, there is always the one character i gravitate towards via personality that I adore but am unable to marry *coughQuintcough*.  Get on making him an marriage canidate, if only a secret canidate OP (I jest, though I would honestly start a new game in a heartbeat if it meant I could marry him...don't judge me >.> ).\n\nI've noticed a couple bugs here and there, but nothing that doesn't seem like it wasn't fixed with the first updated except for one I've had happen to me a couple times now.  When in the clinic, i ring the bell when no one is directly behind the counter and the game freezes.  I can still hear music playing but i have to x out the game and restart.

However, I did not end up enjoying the game all that much. The game really lacks suficiant incentive to make money and expand your farm. Both farming and mining are simpler than they are in HM, and the quests are pretty dull. There is no lumber or stone. This really takes the strategy and financial management aspect out of the game, and the only thing left is earning affection with the villagers.\n\nBascially from the very beginning, you spend all day, every day, running around trying to tag every villager for "heart points" before time runs out. Heart points build incredibly slowly, even if you are giving good gifts.  I felt like I was spending a lot of time doing tedius errands and getting nowhere. While the characters are certainly better than they are in HM, they are not deep enough or interesting enough to carry the entire game. I also really dislike the soccar mini game.\n\nI had a hard time deciding whether to give this game a thumbs up or a thumbs down.

I have been enoying World's Dawn though, despite a couple of glaring issues that will hopefully be addressed in future updates.\n\nThe first issue is the controls. The configuration settings are SUPER confusing. Instead of assigning a key or gamepad button to an action, you're assigning them to arbitrary "A B C X Y Z L and R" buttons that the game uses. The only way to get the buttons assigned to do what you want is trial and error. It's particularly bad when your gamepad only shows up with "button 1" through "Button 10" and you have to guess at BOTH what button is what on your gamepad, and also what button is what in the game. There appears to be NO mouse and keyboard control as well, which is extremely disappointing.\n\nThe other issue is that it runs very poorly, though that is likely because the laptop I've been playing it on so far doesn't technically meet the minimum requirements, as it only has a 1.80 GHz CPU. That said, it probably should run on basically anything, given how simple it is. I think the fact that it was made in RPG maker actually holds it back in this regard.\n\nThe final - and possibly worst - issue is the lack of content.  Currently there are only 40 spots total on which to plant seeds. It's a small garden - not a farm. You also can only have a handful of livestock that you can raise. There is mining, and fishing, but they're both exceptionally shallow from a mechanical standpoint. There are no skills to upgrade, no buildings to upgrade or purchase that I have found yet, and no real sense of progress.\n\nIt's unfortunate, because the game looks pretty good. The art is generally very good. The characters are well designed, the art style is bubbly and cute, and the world itself is well designed. Sadly, it just doesn't make up for the lack of content in the game. I've had the good fortune of being able to see a lot of the obvious competition Stardew Valley, and that game appears to be, in every way, a more complete and entertaining experience. And considering Stardew is only a dollar or two more than World's Dawn, it's hard to recommend this over that.","March 13","false","5.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I really like the style and how the characters look like.\nBUT we all know that this isn't what makes a game well done.\nIt begins with the character creation..\nI think you don't have enough things to create your character because you're just able to change the hair.\nWhen the game started I had no idea what to do or where to find anything.\nI talked to everyone.

I know that the developer has put a lot of time and thought into making the game, but I am not sure that this game is worth the price.\n\nI do like that the graphics are quite polished, it is a very charming setting, and I like that you can have same gender relationships in the game. However in terms of gameplay, I found it was more as if I were playing a game designed for a handheld console and not for PC. The inability to use my mouse for anything was a big drawback, in my opinion, as was the inability to map my keys differently. It felt like I was playing the game on a GBA emulator, and I found the controls clunky and too frustrating to play for very long at a time.\n\nI also think that there is not enough farming in the game, especially as it is very obviously inspired by the Harvest Moon games. If you prefer spending time talking to people/mining/fishing and don't care that much about the farming progression aspect, then you might enjoy the balance.","February 2","false","0.8"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Now it's because my work time is during the day and I only choose to play games at night when my bf plays his games at night, but when he is finished I don't want to stop when he stops, hahaha.\n\nOn a longer note.\n\nIt reminds me of Harvest Moon and Zelda on gameboy advance. I really enjoy the older games from back in the day and this game is reminiscent of them.\n\nPros:\nGood storyline.\nImpressed with the mini games and events\nLike the ways to earn money for crops and animals.\nI get to have a dog and horse as pets! Haha, it fills the urge of not being able to have them in real life.\nLike with real pets you have to take care of them everyday or else they get sick.\n\nCons:\nSome bugs in the game, but the developer does work quickly on them.\n\nMy bf confronts me about not finding me in bed at a certain time of night because I sneak out to play it. (He jokingly does it of course)\n\nIt's enjoyable and brings a smile to my face. I have so many hours because I'm a perfectionist and have restarted the game a couple of times because I wanted certain things so the replay value has been worth it. I would be excited to get all the acheivements in this game unlike in other games, because they seem very attainable and the rewards you get for attaining them actually seem worth it in the game. Like a teleporter stone, or people come back to the village and you get a fishing shop. These are actual worthy acheivements, not like in other games where oh you shot 50 skag! You're a hunter! You just earn a title but no rewards.\n\nReally well thought out. Thanks for making it! I keep enjoying it!\n\nThe play value is so good though and the game exceeded my expections. I even feel like the storyline is so much better than harvest moon in many ways such as the festivals.\n\nI would pay full price for it just to support the developer, although at first I thought it seemed expensive for a rpg game like this considering you can get higher quality games from big names for 12.99. But this game is well thought out, made with a lot of heart in it and fun to play that I think it's worth the full price. 2.99 and 4.99 games are cheap but dont capture my attention enough like this game has.

I hope the developer adds the ability for the MC to have a child with his spouse, let the child grow to a teenager and help around the farm and such. Maybe family-oriented sub-plots?\n\nAnd! Maybe add a couple more festivals to the calendar?\n\nThat's about it and thank you for such a great game. And, I got a steam account just for getting this game.","February 5","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(hint:keep an eye out when you are walking)\n\n15:NO TIME LIMIT!!!!:no time limit?HELL YES,ive been tired of being pushed around being friendly to poeple just to continue playing the game, (but honestly,making friends is part of the charm of harvest moon,having no time limit takes the burden off your shoulders)\n\nwell thats basicly what i got from playing roughly 12-13 hours,overall its a good game,if you like harvest moon,you will like this game\n\n(also if there was any mistake,please comment,from what i know,there is no time limit,but just comment if i did anything wrong in this review)","February 5","true","43.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was amazed at how many characters there were with different personalities and stories, and by how fun it is to just wander around the village.\n\nI've usually played more puzzle-type games, but I've been pleasantly surprised at how fun it is to play a game that allows me to relax instead of have to figure everything out right away.

Sure, you can beat the game in 2 hours if you know what you're doing, but the fun of that first experience with the game is in exploring all of the little details and in this game you can do that, and it's even better as you have a whole little village community to get to experience.\n\nIt's definitely worth $12.  If you're hesitant, pick it up when it's on sale.  It's an RPG maker game, yes, but the only sign of that is with the engine.  All of the assets appear to be custom and frankly that's pretty refreshing to see (I refuse to buy RPG maker games unless they use custom art, because what's the point otherwise?).  Also, there has already been one patch and another is on the way to fix a couple of bugs and add a little extra content.

As a long-time player, I did receive a free copy, but this has no bearing on the review.\n\nWorld's Dawn is a wonderful game with a lot of charm. Anyone to ever play a Harvest Moon game has a good idea of what the game is like, but World's Dawn is better in one of the most important aspects – character. The socialization aspect of the game has been far and away my favorite part - meeting and getting to know all the other characters is just so satisfying! Normally in an HM game I'll make friends with a couple people and whoever I decide to marry I'll boost as quickly as possible and kind of ignore the rest unless I happen to run across them a lot. World's Dawn makes you want to go out of your way to talk to people! It's a real choice between, say, fishing all day and running around town talking to people. And the art is so gorgeous! That's not to say the rest of the game is lackluster – quite the opposite! Fishing is a fun little minigame, mining is a great way to while away an evening, and I make sure to water my crops every morning!\n\nIn closing, I would like to give a round of applause to Wayward Prophet, who spent around five long years on this masterpiece, who has fixed bug after bug, made change after tweak, to make this game the gem it is today.","February 8","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not as extensive as some of its competitors, but it makes up for that with its refreshing and detailed story. There are plenty of things to discover and explore in World's Dawn, and I doubt you'll regret the experience for such a fair price. Most of the reviews I've looked at have been somewhat picky in regards to why they haven't been recommending the game. Mainly, it seems people have complaints about lack of documentation of information in the game and about the controls; however, I don't think this justifies giving the game a bad rep. The gameplay and writing more than make up for these issues, and you'll learn the controls & such as you play the game (I also believe the game developer added a few documentations recently within the game for a few things; I'm sure if they need to they will add more).\n\nNow, let's get onto how I personally percieved the game.\n\nThe Good: Generally cute and relaxing art. (I say generally because I do think a couple of the male portraits could use improvement. Paxel's portrait stood out especially).\nLots of things to explore.\nRelaxing atmosphere & music.\nMany villagers to meet and get to know.\nWriting is exceptionally good. I was very impressed with the quality and quantity of the dialogue available.\n\nThe Bad: (a lot of these are just quality of life things that could improve the game)\nControls are a little awkward. Takes some getting used to.\nI wish there were more character creation options. This isn't necessary, but it would be nice!\nThere could be some improvement on what to do with items, aside from just selling them. I do understand that this is a very casual farming simulator, and that the writing was more focused upon than the actual gameplay.\nI'd like more detailed maps; this is just a personal complaint really. I found it so hard to get around and know where things were. I'm considering drawing my own little map with some details, just so I can have an easier time when I journey outside of my house.\n\n\nAll in all, I believe this to be a decent farming simulator with pretty exceptional writing. I haven't played this as extensively as I should have yet, but I wanted to get my impressions out in the public for now. As I continue to play, if I find anything that differentiates from what I have here, I will edit this if need be. Also, if you cannot justify spending $13 on a casual farming sim, wait for it to go on sale and give it a chance. Personally, I'm glad I did!","May 5","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You take on the role of a young farmer new to town who has dreams of running a successful farm. Gameplay is much like the Harvest Moon games. You plant crops, socialize with townsfolk, forage, and fish, among other things. The artwork is cute enough, and the soundtrack is charming. Like with Harvest Moon, the characters possess some personality, though it's limited to small bits of dialogue that are repeated every time you speak to them. That said, with all of the other features the game has, I'm not really complaining that the characters do not each have huge, sweeping backstories.\n\nIf you're a fan of the Harvest Moon series, I suggest giving World's Dawn a try.","April 14","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I hope this would change).\nMinigames like LockBall and fishing are really easy, so maybe not right kind game for minigame lovers, but players like me who play for stories this is right kind of buy.

The game itself is charming and every character is lovable in it’s own way. You have to work as Farmer/Fisherman/Miner to earn money to buy yourself some decoration for your house or to make presents for the local town people. After a quarter of the game you get a routine how to deliver the presents to each villager and make them all a little happier. The main problem with the game is that it gets redundant after a short while because there is a lack of quests to do and the only special things which are happening are the rare festivals. Some secrets you just need the wiki to complete them and are a real pain to gather all parts (yes I mean the fireflies). The game could have been easily a 9/10 if there would have been many more quests and a more appealing ending.\n\nBut overall I was happy to see my character marrying, amass huge amount of money, spending it on presents and hear the different dialogues of each villager.
