"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Apple303/recommended/317470/","Apple303","Apple303","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Apple303/","124 products in account","I do not recommend even trying this game unless you have a whole lot more money than sense or you hate yourself. Or both.\n\nYou start in a simple tutorial zone which is meant to give you the basics of how to play in an easy to understand manner. I can't comment much on this, because my tutorial stopped working and crashed before I got to learn how to 'pick ♥♥♥♥ up' upon re-opening the game, I ended up with my starter materials wandering around the overworld with no idea what was going on and no way to get back to the tutorial.\n\nOnce you pass (or otherwise end up at the end of) the tutorial, you are placed in one of three 'worlds' which consist of hundreds of tiny and bland little castle towers that represent other player's home realms, there is some variance to these towers which dot the landscape but because re-dressing your tower requires Cubits (the games in game currency) and quite a lot of them, it takes a very long time (or a cash expense) to change what yours looks like. You are also given a 'starter castle' plot which you may place in any of the small amount of remaining plots available to get your own bland castle on the landscape and your own home realm to manipulate. (I recommend you study your surroundings and position on the sky map before devoting your realm to a plot, as it can be easy to lose your home in the plethora of identical homes after you walk away from it. How the realms themselves work I did like however, you enter a realm anywhere on the map by literally 'jumping' into it. It reminds me a lot of the paintings in Mario 64, where each represented a different world you could jump into.\n\nAfter placing, naming and jumping into your personal realm, you may or may not be disappointed to know that the overall aesthetic of your realm has absolutely nothing to do with where you placed it in the overworld. I, for example, placed my realm right next to a mountain mine (I'll talk about the mines later) as it contained many things that fit into my personal aesthetic view. So, to recap, I placed my home next to a mountain, on a tall area of land in the snowy frozen wasteland that is the northern end of Pelago. Thus, I expected my home to be A)Snowy or Icy and/or B)Somewhat mountainous. What I got instead was a nice summertime forest-y area that evidently is all that you get to start with. To my dismay, I also realized very quickly that this world was very tiny. It looks big to begin with, but the moment you try to build something of any scale (I love building castles, which is why I downloaded this game at all, I mean it's got bloody castles in the name!) you'll realize that your realm is actually quite limited, both in height (You can only dig so far down, or get enough resources to artificially build it up first) and it's x,y width. No sooner had I started building what was meant to be a mountain fortress than I realized that not only would my desired castle not fit, but the town I wanted to build outside would not either. This is 'easily' remedied in one of two ways, you can either A) Purchase a 'room' piece, which essentially lets you artificially expand your realm by having tiny realms within it or B) Purchase an entirely new and larger overworld realm (which does have the choice for winter/summer/tropical/etc starts by the way, so they could have let you choose to begin with, this irks me slightly) of course, even the smallest ones are a very large number of Cubits (that currency I brought up earlier) meaning that you either have to destroy your hands and worsen your carpal tunnel, or drop a fat stack of cash on the game in order to improve your realm size.\n\nSo, how exactly do you gain more Cubits if you're not inclined to buy them? Well, as advertised, each object in the game that you can remove from it's location has a very very small chance to drop exactly one. This wont seem so bad to begin with however, as you do seem to get the drops relatively often as you gather materials for your tiny home, or even as you change the land within your tiny home. But then you might be so inclined as to check the Cubit store, where your tiny little naked characters jaw will drop (Oh yeah, you start naked. Basic shirt and pants can be made, but everything else costs 250 Cubits+) for even the least expensive things available are upwards of 100 Cubits. So you may quickly discover that the only reliable way to gather cubits in any useful manner is to purchase a 'tip piggy' (These cost 500 Cubits by the way, so you'll be getting carpal tunnel just to afford one) and then have a home interesting enough for anyone to leave tips (laughable) or try to rope people into buying things that you have/can make and they can't/don't know how to make. For this reason, many people have taken to converting their entire realm into a virtual 'shop' where you can go to purchase various useful items for a handful of your hard-earned Cubits.\n\nHowever, there is no actual trade system. 'Trading' in this game consists of (in the case of buying things) one player placing their Cubits in another player's tip piggy, followed by the 'selling' player, dropping the item you wanted to buy for you to pick up. This of course leads to quite a few problems.\n\n1. You have no garuntee that the seller is not scamming you out of your cubits, only to ban you from their home immediately afterwards (Hasn't happened to me yet but I've seen a lot of people complain about it)\n\n2. Any other passing player can then take your item off the ground before you do, and there's nothing you or the seller can do about it. (Which can host another scam I witnessed where the seller's friend grabs the item to give it back later)\n\n3. In the case of Realm/Room items, there's no garuntee that you don't drop 1200 Cubits for a room of a certain size, or season, only for the seller to drop a 'closet' sized (the very cheapest one, you can buy them with 200 Cubits) 10x10 realm for you.\n\nAll of these things leave both buyers and sellers weary, as buyers become less likely to buy without the item first (they might steal it) and sellers have to go to great lengths to show themselves as a 'legitimate' seller. All because there's not even some semblance of a trading system implemented into the game. (Don't forget that just BUYING a tip piggy so that you can sell things and receive tips, costs you a cool 500 Cubits) I am largely convinced that these previous aspects of the game, combined with language barriers, create the next problem I've seen.\n\n\nEveryone is anti-social as all hell. Some of the more popular rooms include; The room that teaches you how to make stuff (Careful trying to craft there, as people can steal your stuff while you're crafting), Shops, where so far I've met one person who can speak English fluently enough for transactions not to seem like I'm about to be stolen from:\n\nThe last interaction I had with a 'shop' keeper:\n"So can I see the product before I give you 80 Cubits, so I know you're not trying to scam me?"\n"80 Cubits yes. Piggy."\n\nand rooms that purport to have some sort of activity to do, such as obstacle courses and jumpy rooms (Literally all you can make with the limited interactive blocks) or some combination of the two. Few people stay in any one of these places long before going AFK or leaving, many without saying a word. The few times you may be graced by the presence of a random visitor while in your home, they generally just jump around for a minute without saying anything and then leave, or beg for your things and then leave. One time I had someone ask if they could buy something, the only other person that spoke to me told me that my room (still under construction mind you) sucked while he played on my water spring before quitting.\n\nI have now realized I'm like one sentence from the limit on this thing, so I can't even get to the rest of the stuff that's terrible about this game. It's just not worth your time.","October 7, 2014","false","22.2"," 542 of 626 people (87%) found this review helpful 78 people found this review funny","87","542","626","78","41"

Sadly it all went down hill.\nMy biggest complaint?\nYou can not make doors. you need to buy them.. With REAL MONEY.. or play enough to earn the money. That takes forever. I only had 18( of the in game money) after three hours. Doors cost about 250.\nAnyone can come into your place and take your things unless the chest or a door is locked.\nI was working at my bench and someone came in, took the things from my bench and left.\nYou also need to make walls 5+ High. They can be double jumped over so a small wall will not protect your things.\n\n\nWant to lock that chest or door? You need to buy an item to lock it.( you do start with one)\nYou can just lock your realm.. but what is the point in building nice things if no one will see it.\n\nThe cost of items in the shop is CRAZY... For the lazy you can buy everything that can be made or gathered in the shop\n(from what I could see). No need to grab all that dirt when you can buy it.\n\nYou want to make a new chest? You need to level. There is a chance you can learn how to do carpentry when you do..  Even then you need to learn how to use a hammer.. that also is random from leveling. I was level 5 and I never once had the chance to learn it. I had a full chest and no way to make another.\n\nYou also can not just start over. There seems to be no way to delete an account. After learning how to play.. I made another account because I could not delete the one I had. That also meant a new username. I was locked out of my account for forgetting my password and not being able to log in with my other name Because " it was taken". Yes. it was taken, BY ME...\n\nI really wanted to like the game, The deed decay ( It will remove your land from the game world if you are gone for too long), camera, the crashing along with everything else I have said was enough to have me uninstall.\n\nOn a side note. I do understand the deed decay.. Many people will play once but never go back. But I should not have to log in all the time in fear of losing my spot.\n\nIf you are going on to see a friends place or you just want to check it out, I say do so! Some of the things people have made is awesome.\nIf you want to just play.. You better have some cash.\n\nRead all this? you get a cookie.","November 25, 2014","false","3.6"," 402 of 475 people (85%) found this review helpful 68 people found this review funny","85","402","475","68","20"

Might as well play Godus. Also, the only limit is your imagination? How about how deep your wallet is.\n\n\nLet me give you a break down. This game looks innocent enough, nice voxel style that everyone is familiar with by now, and the game seems so innocent with it's tutorial setup. That is all a mask that the game pulls off almost as soon as you step into the real game. You start out as a white blob that you have named what ever you want. In my case, I named myself Pigeon Lord to follow my trend of fowl named stuff. I claimed a nice section of the Winter Wasteland biome, but then I found that my realm was not all snowy and beautifully glazed with ice. I found that my land had been struck with a massive case of Global Warming and all the nice winter decor was gone and replaced with a regular forest. I could get around this, if I hadn't decided to look at the upper corner with the little shop section. This game is laced with micro-transactions that seem to make EA look like it is a newcomer to the whole free-to-play section of gaming. The biggest bundle is $20 and gives you 50,000 of the in-game currency. This may seem like a lot at first, considering that mining random blocks has a chance of giving you only 1 Cubit (In-game currency name). The game actually sells some items like the House Pack, which contains some tems for 100 Cubits, but then you get the Almighty Cube Pack which gives you 1x Almighty Cube, and it does NOTHING! The Almighy Cube has no use except to show that you either grinded away until your fingers broke off and then used your nose to play the game, or that you decided to throw more money at Cosmic Cow, and the fact that the pack costs 25,000 Cubits is what makes gamers hate free to plays! This game also has a stunning lack to move the camera downwards from it's skewed angle, making it impossible to make any form of dungeon if you wanted to make a nice Castle RP Realm. The world only likes to look from an angle that makes it even impossible to decide where you want to make a basement for a nice building if you wanted to, for it lacks any sense of the word elevation. If you wanted to make a basement anyways, you would either have to make the walls out of clear glass to be able to see inside, and even then you have to cut out two walls to make sure you can actually make sure your character isn't running straight into a wall all the time. Then we get on the idea of how you would even have enough room for some of the amazing things they show in their screenshots above. The realms that you get are a decent size to build a small amount of stuff, and then end up ripping your heart out when you go to make a nice Bungelow, for the realms only go about 4-5 blocks deep, but if you buy the more expensive, larger ones you might have more space for building underground, or just have to buy enough blocks to build the whole world up and then put in your basement. This game isn't currently worth anyones time, and if you want to try it, then download the 31 mb and wait for the game to find a server, for that is another bug that exists. The game will freak out and not let you even play it's tutorial if it can't find you a server, and it usually take a good 10-15 minutes for the game to realize that you are actually able to connet to one of their servers. Until they fix the pacing of the game and how often the currency drops and if the worlds and camera learn the word elevation, this game isn't even worth the .9 hours I put into it.","August 13, 2014","false","1.1"," 634 of 789 people (80%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","80","634","789","16","28"

The horrible part is that literally in the middle of me crafting at my anvil a random person goes into my instance that i created(because you cant make it to wherer only you can go in) goes to the crafting bench and takes the items i just mined for an hour. Evidently the crafting table is shared between people. Its nice that you can work for the currency in the game, but when you work for something just to have it taken shortly after(literally 1 min after I bought something someone stole it and dced).

I think.... I dunno. I logged on, figured out what to do with the building and all, and tried to enjoy it. You get free (crowded) mining areas, that when you mine something, another player freely runs up and grabs it. So it becomes a running ffa to get anything you can find. I also saw another player trading something with a second player, and some other dude ran up and grabbed the item and ran off. Then there was a lot of cussing, trolling and "why don't you trade in your own realms" kind of thing. Common to these sort of games.\n\nSo I got some stuff to start with, after finally figuring out how to place my own realm. Should be hard, but there are so many people on that you have to hunt for free space - this is what took about an hour of my 2.6 hours of game time.\n\nI started building, and I like elaborate buildings. I'm a Lego lover, and these "minecraft" like games are the ones I enjoy trying. But this one doesn't bring much new to the table. It is Isometric, so that is new, but unfortunately, this game doesn't make that work at all. My issue is that you are forced to build without roofs, and are left with 1 layer of floors. After numerous of attempts, I have found no way (obvious or not) of removing layers to see in my buildings or under them into basements and such, or tunnels and caves - anything I could want to build.... I can't. The second issue, is there is no real challenge other than resource hunting with other players. Sure, this can be a challenge, a work around is just to log on during off-peak hours. Cool, I can do that. Now the challenge is gone. People can come and see my creations at will, there aren't easy (and by easy, I mean cheap) ways to prevent this - Unless I want to spend real money to prevent people from looking at my stuff - and I don't see it as a big threat, since they can't modify it. Without hacks.\n\nThen, when I logged back on, the annoying thing happened. It took me about 10 minutes to figure out that I didn't spawn in a random place, my home was gone. So I start getting frustrated, until I see the deed back in my inventory. So I go to place my home again, and of coarse - No space. Another hour of space hunting.... And then play for 10 minutes or so before getting completely bored and uninspired, since I can't see into my home at all now that I added a roof.... GG. I'm sure it will get better, they'll even add to where you can cut away layers to see INTO your creations (you know, where I like to store my stuff, inside my house, not the roof). So I'll check in periodically, but so far, I see no promise or potential from this product, sorry.\n\n\nOh, and it isn't an "Early Release," so I can't even use that as an excuse with this one... Free is good, but this is Microtransaction hell.... I honestly did write this thinking it was another early access >.< I wouldn't buy it, it seems so unfinished at the moment.....

When I say that, I mean you get a tiny plot of land. From that you can gather a small amount of resources. You can also head over to the mines to gather some more resources. I do believe these regen, how often, I am unsure. The tutorial is bad, because it tells you how to move, use an anvil (Basic Crafting Station), and place/break blocks. It doesn't actually let you place/break blocks, because the tutorial is part of the spawn area, and they don't want greifing. There is no single-player, so on trips where you can't have internet, this is unplayable. It tells you nothing about crafting recipes, except that objects have a little tooltip saying if it's in crafting recipe. Some may call it discovery, I call it a lack of wiki. At least, I haven't found one yet. There is one currency, which is cubits. You rarely get them from mining resources, but everything is very expensive, so you'll have to pay up some cash to get anywhere quickly.

It's not really that simple, but not that complex either.\n+ Getting resource is so damn easy here (compared to other sandbox game I played).\n+ PVP is somewhat funny, not all serious and scary :D I lol-ed so hard when my friend using the shrink-wand on me.\n+ Getting to other's people realm is easy (unless they lock the realm or it's only accessible for friend only). So when you got bored you can explore other people homes.\n\nCons:\n- Camera is really..quite an annoying issue in this game. Even though you can unlock camera for "better" view of the world, it still quite uncomfortable.\n-  The no-cancel action. Like you mistakenly click for the wrong block. And there's really no way to cancel that action, not even moving your character can cancel it (unless you do the wrong click far away from your character).\n- The perks have it's disadvantages tool. Each time you level up, you get a chance to pick 1 of the 3 random skill the system give you. Some tools needs certain skill so that you can use it to make items, and you will suffer a lot if you choose the less-important one (since leveling up become harder once you're pass 15 or maybe 20).\n- The player(s) can be quite amazingly annoying sometimes. I'm not saying all players are like that. But really, some of them love to use caps lock so much it hurts, or try to scam using the old piggy tip method, or begging like their life really depends so much on your pity, and some of them doesn't even understand the word "no". And that's what I encounter on daily basis while I play the game.\n-The quest. I'm aware that this a free-to-play game with a slice of Micro-transaction, but really, after you have done the basic quest, in order to get more quest you have to buy it with cubits.

It might be wiser to just make the quest equal to all paying player and the non-paying player.\n\n\n---\nI quiet enjoy the time I spent in this game, but that's because I have my friends also playing this game with me. On the other hand I also feel the game is quite boring due to lack of quest and the annoying player (and also that awkward camera...).\n\nAnd the stress only got worse if you decide to play without using real money to buy the glorious cubits (because you need a lot of those to even craft some important item like doors, key (for personal/friend/or password-protect), cash register (to safely trade with your friends), etc.","January 10, 2015","false","68.6"," 111 of 168 people (66%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","66","111","168","14","7"

While you can make a cool house, it won’t do anything for you. A game needs a purpose. Maybe if there was at least a server dedicated to strict roleplaying, then maybe I would stick around.\n\nAlso I hate the fact that we have to make a hole inside our houses in order to see what's in them and even then it's still difficult to see what's going on.

While also interacting with other players in order to trade goods, or recieve them. There is an ingame currency, however it can also be earnt, and with the right knowledge, you can earn it easily with a marketing eye. For instance, I have a friend who has NEVER brought cubits (ingame currency), and yet always seems to have more than me; Of which, I buy the cubits.\n\nPros:Great support- With that said, I have sent plenty of reports in. They are answered fairy fast, usually in less than 2 days depending on how busy they are with tickets.\n\nFriendly players- A lot of the players are friendly, willing to help newbies settle in, and even build if necessary. I personally love to help new players, and will donate them a few hats, and wings depending on how many I have in stock/and or spare. I'll ask if they need any help, and try my best to fill in that request. Many other players put themselves out there to do the same.\n\nEvents- There are plenty of events that take place within the game, although there is a forum to keep up to date with this, as well as a facebook page, ect. Easter, Halloween, and Christmas are what I've seen so far. It's nice to know that the devs go out of there way to make it just     that much more interesting. Some of the events include free /limited/ hats, if you're lucky enough to catch the person giving them.\n\nUpdates- The moment a bug is spotted, and reported in, it is soon after fixed. Updates are frequent, and the game tends to run smoothly (depending on your internet strength).\n\nCons:Difficulty- When you start the game, you have no perks. (perks are basically abilites you get with levelling up, making gameplay more fun) and so it takes longer to do stuff, such as mining very slowing and not being able to jump very high makes parkour difficult.","April 16, 2015","true","735.0"," 56 of 98 people (57%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","57","56","98","16","0"

There are a lot of people that are trying to capitallize on Minecraft's success(Believe me, I've seen my fair share on iOS and Android), but this is not one of them. This game's relation to Minecraft(Hereon referred to as MC) is like Unturned's relation to MC: Possibly inspired and similar with blocks and vector-based graphics. JUST BECAUSE A GAME HAS THOSE THINGS DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT IS A MC RIPOFF.\nNow that I've got that out of the way, here is my opinion.\n\nThis game is like the Mario game series had a child with Minecraft, with Terraria as the godfather, with some awesome F2P buisiness strategy thrown in. It has a focus on platforming and building alike. Now, the F2P buisiness strategy. It is a fantastic model, where you can earn the in-game currency named Cubits through several methods. One, of course, is getting them with real money. Cubits(Often abbriviated to C or c, and will be referred to as CB from hereon) will also occasionally pop up when breaking a block. You can also earn them by doing quests or selling things. Yes, this game has a alive and THRIVING player economy. You can obtain blocks one of 3 ways: Mining them in the mines sprinkled generously around the HUUUUUGE map, buying them with CB(You can buy pretty much every block in the game in the store, as well as a few exclusive blocks) or buying them from another player. You can also complete offers on mobile to get CB. "Wait, what!?!?", I hear you asking. Why yes, the game is also availible on iOS and Android as well. The best part is that you can be playing on the computer, have to go on a trip somwhere, and you can pick up and play the game from where you left off on the computer. That is the icing on the dessert known as the Churpumple: A pie inside of a cake that is a dessert that is sometimes made in my family, but that's beside the point. Refer to the simple chart below for a TL;DR version and my dislikes:\n\nYEAH!:\n-Awesome focus on platforming and building\n-Epic, thriving in-game economy\n-Many ways to earn in-game currency\n-Only 1 currency, no gems or tickets or super coins or anything like that\n-SOOO fun to play\n-You can play on iOS and Android from where you left off on the computer\nUGH!\n-You have to buy sentries to keep your rooms(Mini-realms that can be put in your realm) safe\n-Getting blocks can be really time-consuming\n-Hollas, game-wide broadcasts made by players, can be really annoying\n-Quests can be as simple as mining 16 blocks of sand or as hard as doing hard parkour\n-You need perks to do basically anything in this game, which means you'll have to pick between emotes appearing on your person's face, be able to have 1 more row of items in your inventory without your person slowing to a crawl, or the abillity to use a saw to craft\n-Realms decay over time and dissapear(They get put directly back into your inventory though. (Thanks for pointing that out, BJDware!))\n\nVERDICT:\n10.1/10\nVery good in-game purchase system, not forcing you to pay to win. There isn't a premium membership that costs 10 bucks per month or anything, so it's awesome. Thriving in-game community and economy. Also, may I throw in that you can harvest liquids without any machines and liquids don't flow?(Not saying I WANT to have machines to harvest liquid, but it is kinda wierd)\n\nDecision: Take all of this and put it DIRECTLY into my Steam account.","April 11, 2015","true","14.1"," 39 of 67 people (58%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","58","39","67","16","5"

I know allowing the camera to move in any direction is a tall order, but the limiting birds-eye view camera subconciously drives me nuts (Not the 'annoyed' nuts, the 'uncomfortable' nuts...) This is also coupled along with the game being really confusing - spawned in a world with a bunch of castle towers everywhere; i am surprised i managed to make a realm in under 30 minutes.  I will come back to the confusingness of the game later.\nI was then put into my own realm which i Quote-en-quote "Own" even though any old stranger can come inside because the entering permission button is greyed out. I was only able to make my realm "private" after a person showed me how to block off the door.\nThe final, and biggest grope i have about this game is how confusing it is. This review would be positive if the game was not so confusing. The crafting recipes are stupidly complex and i didnt even have two clues on what to do. I was just going around my realm destroying stuff in hope that by putting junk into the anvil i might get something. The game has hundreds of hundreds of blocks and items yet there are no recipies and you have to figure it all out by yourself.\nThe graphics however are decent and the controls are pretty good, apart from the camera, and it is sad to see a concept like this go to waste.","September 18, 2014","false","1.4"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","13","19","0","0"

It's sad to see so many negative reviews from players who haven't had played it for at least 100 hours, so in my opinion their reviews don't worth attention since they haven't experienced all of the games positive sides.\n\nThis game might have some little issues like disconnecting, BUT it always gets fixed pretty fast. Plus it gets new amazing improvements each month, new amazing stuff in the store and new blocks which you can use to build literally anything, depends on how creative you are. You can build an amazing world in your realm, create games like parkours, mazes, story realms, etc. Can join clans and even participate in fun events in which you can get some nice prizes.\n\nThe only thing that might be uncomfortable is camera angles, but you get used to it pretty fast. And also this game as any other online game has good and bad players, so my friendly tip is play smart and don't trust whoever you just met, but don't worry, there's still more nice and friendly players than bad players.\n\nI can rate this game 9/10, so go give it a try, because it's fun and it's free.","April 21, 2015","true","167.0"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","9"

Its improvements are pretty nice, and new stuff are added like every month or less. I have been playing Cubic Castles, since August, 31st of 2014, and spent 1,900 hours here on Steam, and most likely 500 hours from other devices and I'm not bored at all playing it. It may have some server disadvantages rarely, but the administrators of the game, get aware of any problem right away, so expect it will be fixed very soon. Well, another little disadvantage are scams. But if you learn to play safe, and follow some rules, you won't ever get scammed. So play safe, and you will enjoy it. It's worth playing it.\n9.5/10 in my opinion, and I highly recommend Cubic Castles.

And even if it is, you can get 1,000 cubics for just 99cents. That's more than enough for these "housing packs" or whatever. The only things that I noticed that are store bought only are extra rooms, castle skins, character clothing (Some you can craft.) and some parkour realm necesseties. (Checkpoints and health blocks) However, you can earn these cubics anyway, even if it's at a slower pace. If you're dedicated, you can mow in those cubics. If not, heck ,there's coupon codes you can try and look out for to get 1k-2k cubics. Everything besides what I mentioned can be earned by crafting.\n\nServer problems have gotten better. I noticed the top reviews were ones made on the day of the release. How could you expect server issues to be in tip top shape with the large influx of new players coming in? I for one had an account-specific issue once, and it fixed itself in a couple hours. It didn't happen again. This game is sure to continuously get better over time.\n\nIf you don't want to spend your precious cubics on an extra room, or on sentries to keep your chest safe, block them. Make sure your building privacy is setting to you and/or your trusted, and put all your important stuff in a shell of blocks so strangers can't steal anything.\n\nTLDR; This game allows you to craft and get 95% of everything it offers, and it will continuously get better. Also, block your chests. What else could you want from a F2P game?","August 31, 2014","true","29.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Ok then, this game is Minecraft with always online DRM and makes the game unplayable. The game constantly asks you to bring in more friends, even though it can't handle the server stress right now. Good Idea Dev's bring more people onto a server thats already showing signs of failure. Its also a Pay 2 Play. You want blocks, either use a mine until your fingers turn to dust or just take out your credit card. Need one more item to finish crafting, get out your credit card. Biomes make no sense aswell, from what I have gathered no matter what biome you are in it is the normal biome. The camera is always pointed down making basements, towers, caves, etc. impossible. Looking into a pit is even to hard to do. The stuff shown in the pictures of the store page are basically when you have mined for a million hours and your hands are gone or spending atleast 50$ on this game. The crafting system makes no sense. (You put items in randomly and look for the thing you want to craft.) Also lets say you make the mistake of you want friends to build and you set it to everyone. Your plot of land will be gone just the most bottom layer is left. You know whats a better game than this but still similar Minecraft.

The game had zero appeal and should be moved to early access or delayed until it is properly completed. Minimal effort was put into this game at all.\n\nCubic castles is another bandwagon "block-based sandbox" title that is trying to run off of the success of Minecraft. They offered things like an open-world that is actually extremely confined. The MMO aspect of it is not the best either. The servers often crash and obviously went through little maintenence before launch. Each character is given a ridiculously small world that they are allowed to build in. However the plots are barely even usable. It is impossible to dig down since the camera angle doesnt pan up or down, and blocks always appear solid.\n\nBut in addition to this game's horrible layout is microtransactions. You need to pay at least $30 for every usable block. One block is even described as "completely useless and limited to 1 per realm" then followed by a statement along the lines of "let your friends see that you have this mysterious block."

So unless you live in a third world country where you get payed less than $3 an hour it isn't worth your time to mine thousands of blocks for cubits. I've got about 730 cubits in my playtime of 19 hours, though a lot of that time was spent talking to people. I've barely even touched my own base yet but I've got thousands of blocks and all of the tools you can get in the game. Which I've made myself.\n\nI wouldn't waste cubits on the stores ores or blocks or anything like that you can get from mining. You can just ask around and you will surely be able to buy the stuff you need from people for cheaper prices. I traded 5 chests earlier for a viking helm (insanely good deal). Though trading atm is putting your trust in the other person not to rip you off. Hopefully they will get the trading menu in sooner rather than later.\n\nCabinets/chests can be opened by anyone within your realm so make sure they are hidden underground (at least one block over them and on the sides (I've seen hackers, which can clip outside of walls). You'll want to go to the tropical mine through the sky portal (I think it's called that) and pick up some rubber trees ( you just place one of the rubber tree logs on the ground and it will produce rubber) and some cotton plants if you want to have some of them.\n\nTLDR: If you want to get nice things without lots of tedious mining you are going to have to buy cubits and if you want ores/blocks/ anything you can make ingame you should buy them from players as it will be cheaper. The trading system is pretty much based on trust atm so remember what your mother told you about talking to strangers. (don't trust anyone) Sure there's plenty of trustworthy people but there's lots of non trust worthy people (I haven't been burned yet but I don't take chances) I'd also suggest you look up the receipe list (cubiccastles.com/recipes) Most things aren't hard to buy and things don't really require many resources to build. Of course you can't build any clothing other than pants and a shirt atm. So you will either have to trade or buy them with cubits. You can also travel to other peoples realms and use their workshops if you don't have one yet. Other people can and will take items out of the workshops when you are using them that you've put in them. Chests can be opened by people who do not own them so cover them when not in use or people are around (covering them does not close the screen for them if they've been opened by someone). You don't need to spend 7000 cubits on a 100x100 plot as rooms are way cheaper and you can get a 100x100 room for either 2000 cubits or 4000 (I don't even have close to it so I don't remember) Check out the steam forums if you have questions.\n\nThe game is a little buggy atm with quite a few crashes and disconnects but I've never lost any progress or items because of them. When the game hangs just use task manager and exit the game.\n\n","August 15, 2014","true","71.8"," 31 of 60 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","31","60","2","0"

Sure, maybe there isn't much to do after a while, but the developers are working on PvP for the next update, and a trade system is also on it's way.\n\nPros:\n- Smooth gameplay\n- Worlds shared by all other players\n- Innovative system that makes castles "decay" after a while, depending on how much work has been put into the castle preventing the worlds from being filled up by players who play the game for about five minutes before leaving\n- Decayed castles turn back into castle deeds which can then be placed again to regain access to your castle\n- Useful security settings regarding realm management (protecting your world and allowing your friends to build there)\n- Single currency obtainable through gameplay or by purchasing from the store with reasonable prices\n- Rooms allow you to expand your realm without having to make an entirely new one\n- Community better than my expectations, although still often untrustworthy\n- Easy to understand crafting system\n- Paywalls non existant.\n\nCons:\n- Camera controls are VERY annoying, I admit. You can only rotate the camera around your character from above. You can't dig holes or make houses with roofs because otherwise you won't even be able to see your character\n- Scamming is prominent; you have to be very careful with who you trade with because otherwise your items will be lost forever\n- Tutorial leaves quite a bit out. "What on earth are rooms? Why has my realm disappeared? Why can't I see my character behind a mountain? This game sucks. I'm uninstalling it."\n- Is a mobile port, meaning that the game doesn't work as well as it could on PC\n\nFinal verdict:\nPlease give this game a chance. It's brand new and it doesn't abuse it's privillages as a F2P. If you need help, which you will, the developer provides a FAQ and a crafting list on the game's website (links below). But for the love of god fix the camera, please :(\n\nCrafting List: http://www.cubiccastles.com/recipes.php\nFAQ: http://www.cubiccastles.com/faq.php","September 12, 2014","true","179.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jradyIsAwesome/recommended/317470/","jradyIsAwesome","Jrady","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jradyIsAwesome/","195 products in account","A very fun game where you create your own world.  Get what you need in the mines, and then build what you want in your realm.  You can craft lots of things, and get cubits from mining to spend on premium items in the cubit store.  You could set up your own shop, or create a feindish parkour course, or just socialize with your friends while mining to your hearts content.  It is a free game, but be warned, it has microtransactions, but if you like a game, isn't it best to support the devs to keep it going?\n\nI like this game, because it's a great way to be creative.  I get to create 3d mazes for people to do.  I'm kind of sad that no one wants to do my mazes because they are so hard though.  It's also fun to dress up your character with interesting clothes.  One of my favorite parts about Cubic Castles is that it is new, and you can get to know some of the more famous members of the community, as well as most of them knowing each other, unlike some of the older games where you would be lucky to ever see anyone that is remotely famous.","April 6, 2015","true","967.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Another F2P game has arrived but is it any good? HELL-...Wait. Let's give the game some credit before we bash the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. The game does have some decent values to it, the concept is pretty nice actually, you start off in an overworld filled with realms created by other people that you can just hop into and check out (Although most are empty because it's just released). And if you are huge fan of prison break off minecraft then trust me you will have a blast...Well except for the fact the game is filled with Microtransactions...But wait, there has to be a way to earn 'cubits' right? Yes!....If of course you wanna grind for hours to earn say 10. Basically after a certain amount of blocks (or just randomly) the game gives you a cubit. Only 1? Things must be hella cheap!...And if you thought that you would be wrong. To simply buy an outfit it costs about 200 and to buy a grass block it costs 1. But wait, if it costs 1 to buy a grass block sureley you earn 1 for selling a grass block? Nope, that's what I thought and hoped for and I actually had high hopes for that feature when I decided to check it out. So if they add that in will it be a decent-ish game? Definately even though it's designed for mobile it will still be worth it since it's free.\n\n1/10 For microtransactions to hell. Will be upped to a 6.5/10 if you can sell blocks which would also change it to a positive review :P.\n\nVideo: (Coming Soon)","August 13, 2014","false","0.7"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","12"

I like Cubic Castles for several reasons, which I'll outline below, but in broad strokes it's easy to learn, easy to play, and there is a very pleasant community within the game, here on Steam, and on the official forums for the game.\n\nPros:\nVery polished look. The game looks wonderful, the blocks are crisp and colorful. The mining zones generate in a way that looks plausible and clean. It's easy to tell one kind of resource from another on the screen with different patterns, textures and colors that make each distinct.\n\nEasy control - movement is basically the four cardinal directions along with single and double jumps. Camera angle and elevation control are easy.\n\nWide variety of craftable items - This is pretty self-explanatory, but if you play the game I recommend having a browser window open in the background leading to cubiccastles.com/recipes.php - it's a valuable resource the details how each item is built.\n\nCommunity - the players tend to be very nice people. I've only encountered one really rude player so far, and I have a decent amount of hours invested. That's rare in any multi-player online game.\n\nLots to see and do - people build and maintain realms with all sorts of goodies. Some are shops, some are games or metagames, some have puzzles or obstacle courses (known in game as parkour areas, a great co-opting of the word.) People make hangout rooms and places just to see interesting things. Simply hopping from one realm to the next can be fun and also inspire new ideas on things to build.\n\n\nCons:\nLimited camera angle/not designed for first person view - That's a limitation that carries with it a very specific consequence: It makes it difficult to make multi-level structures that can be navigated easily. For example, I have built houses with two floors, and in order to make the first floor seen I have to make the second floor significantly higher in order for the third person view to allow others to see it. It would be nice to have a first person option, or total camera control, or both.\n\nLimited chat function - generally the chat is limited to local players only. The game makes money in a few ways, one of which is selling "Hollas" which are essentially a global chat broadcast. This is a minor issue, as any game needs to make money to survive, and as revenue-generators go that is a very mild one. A readily available chat option to speak to online friends via a tell or direct message would be nice.\n\nOccasional beggars - players frequently show up in one's realm begging for free stuff. That's not a flaw with the game directly, but as a community issue it is at least something to make note of. The positive item, however, is that you can easily kick-and-ban those pesky panhandlers.\n\nSummary/TL;DR\nIt's a load of fun with a few issues that are more of a "hmmm" thing than a deal breaker. I recommend the game highly and hope to see you there.","April 17, 2015","true","312.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","4"

As of right now, the servers are absolutely terrible with tons of connection issues, the camera angles need to be controllable, and we need an offline mode for singleplayer. Other than that, this game is pretty fun. Everyone is saying this game is pay to play or pay to win but honestly, just like minecraft, all you have to do is go gather materials if you need them.... and you get in game currency by gathering what you need which you can then spend on items from the shop. Theres absolutely no need for any type of money spending to enjoy the game even if some of the prices in the shop are a bit high. Once the devs fix the server issues I will be playing this game a LOT. I'm a big fan of minecraft and this game is similar in a lot of aspects with pretty graphics and simple controls. Relaxing sandbox game with a few issues at the moment.\n\n**EDIT**\nThe servers are now up and running smoothly and this game is really fun. Takes a while to get in-game currency but it is possible to obtain everything in the shop without spending real money. Lots of active players and a nice assortment of blocks/items to customize your realm or your character.","August 13, 2014","true","48.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","1"

We live in something called the 'real world.' No, not the MTV version, the actual real world where people have to eat to live. Stop complaining about a F2P having an online store, unless you want to fork over $5billion so the rest of the world can experience it for free.\n\nWell, if I haven't offended you and scared you away, what of the actual game?\nI've decided to arrange it, in pros and cons for simpler explanation:\n\nGame Concept: 9/10\n+ It's a delightful little sandbox game that allows you to build to your own imagination\n- It's still in development and there are plenty of bugs that arise\n+ It's still in development and it promises much more to come, the team likes suggestions from the players\n- Not much to do at the moment besides build, mine, craft, parkour, explore, and hangout\n(ok.. so that's actually a lot)\n+ Promises of monsters in the future will keep gameplay interesting\n+ It's Free 2 Play, not even Pay 2 Win (You can earn ingame money simply by mining)\n+ Lack of PvP at the moment allows for more casual and laid-back gameplay\n+ Talk of PvP in certain realms in the future\n\nTechnical Issues: 6/10\n- Apparently some people are/were expierencing connection issues (I didn't, but I'll take their word for it)\n+ From my past expierence with them, the Dev team is very quick and helpful when it comes to problems\n\nPlayers: 8/10\n+ There's a friendly group of people who are out and about in the game willing to help\n+ Most of the in-game world is created by the players. Even the curent Official Realms were designed by the players\n- Some players will try to steal your things (welcome to an MMO)\n+ There ARE ways to protect your stuff, you just have to read about it\n\nItems Currently Available: 8/10\n+ A majority of the items can be crafted without any ingame money involved\n+ Almost 300 different blocks, tools, and items already ingame\n+ 68 pieces of ingame clothing (18 of which can be crafted with no ingame currency at all)\n+ 6 Different types of realms/rooms with more on the way\n\nCrafting: 7/10\n- The crafting system can be a bit confusing when forgetting recipes\n+ Recipes are listed right on the website as well as in an ingame realm\n\nOverall Rating: ~8/10\n\nNot every gamer is the same, so perhaps it's best to describe who would LIKE playing this game.\n\n* Not a hardcore PVP fan\n* PVE fighting is optional for you\n* Enjoy the cartoony graphics\n* LOVE to build\n* Like to explore\n* Don't need a story, love open worlds\n* A socialable person\n* OK with the occassional bug/glitch in a new game\n\nThen try this game out!

There are a few things I find useful in the shop which are the sentrys for chests and the extra rooms/relms, the rest of the items are just extra blocks or hats (But knowing the steam community you'll be willing to throw away your entire income on a hat).\n\nTheres much more I could say about this game but I think what I've said will encorage you to try this game out; and anyway its free and is quick to download so its no trouble to have a quick look at this game.\n\nThis is my first review of a game on steam and I'd love to hear what you think of this reveiw.","August 16, 2014","true","12.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It's light weight, cute, and has very simple mechanics that are transferable from other games, so if you've played any platformer, you should be able to master this game quickly.\n\nA lot of people whine that you have to pay money for "cubics" (the in-game currency) to buy anything useful, but that's completely untrue. Virtually every block can be found in-game or crafted from blocks found in-game. The only things really worth spending your cubics on would be more personal realms (beyond the initial free one given to each player), extra rooms for your realms, or cosmetic items. Blocks found in-game CAN be purchased with cubics by the extra lazy, but it's so easy to find the blocks you want that there's no reason to.\n\nIn the first day of play (about 5 hours of zone-out time), I managed to get over 1,000 cubics and level up several times, unlocking "perks" which allowed me to craft more advanced blocks, tools, and toys. Once I had these things unlocked, I was able to get more ambitious with my building projects making a castle that rests on narrow outcroppings of rock above a lake of lava. It was easy and fun to make and made my personal realm a hang out spot for the friends I made in-game.\n\nMy greatest complaint for Cubic Castles, without a doubt, has to be the extremely shoddy camera control. Nowhere in the tutorial does it explain how to control your camera and for the first day or so, I assumed there was a fixed camera. While there are benefits for having an overhead view of your character and landscape, I think the game would benefit greatly from a first-person or third-person view. In its current state, navigating below-ground or under any sort of structure can get in the way of the camera and obstruct your view entirely.\n\nAnother feature that is lack-luster is the PvP combat system which revolves entirely around "wands" that can only be crafted by experienced players and are not very intuitive in actual combat resulting in a high chance of missing. Also, there's completely no penalty for dying or benefit from killing another player.\n\nOverall, though, I have to recommend the game because it IS entertaining and it's so light that even weak rigs can run it at the same time as another video or livestream or even another game.","December 4, 2014","true","239.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

And the game ISN'T P2P, you can mine blocks and craft blocks, only some blocks can be brought and most of those are unneeded to make a simple realm. Cubits can be gotten by saving to get a store and using that store to get cubits (most effective way), or by mining (go for the trees for more cubits).  8BitMMO is kinda P2P as you need to buy all blocks from the store and some need a special paid currency, I see no one talking about that! (Note: I do like 8BitMMO and I don't hate it, and no this isn't product placement either) Another is thing is that older reviewers are talking about and aren't present to recent updates, the server doesn't crash often, and by often I mean once or twice a week. This game ISN'T a Minecraft clone by any means, there is a clear distance between this and Minecraft - now don't worry fanboys/girls I don't hate Minecraft, I hate you guys because you over react and defend Minecraft on Minecraft threads. This game has whole different style to Minecraft, gameplay as well. So play the game for at least 2 hours before reviewing because if you don't, this will be your comment: Originally posted by Minecraft_Fan123123: This game is a total Minecraft rip-off, I hope Jeb/Notch sues u! . 0.1 hours played.

Fight, Talk, or Bargain = No Difference. This frees you to be as idealistic and altruistic or as cold-heartedly cynical and self-serving as you want in your "choices" since nothing you do will ever affect anything that happens on this one-track plot railroad masquerading as an "adventure game".\n\nIf you steel yourself and play it again as I did rather exhaustively, then you will quickly discover that your - "choices" - won't change a single thing beyond a line or two of spoken dialogue here or there...and perhaps the life or death of a completely insignificant and inconsequential extra whose life or death can have absolutely no significance since even if said character had a name and a voice in the story your "choice" will have relegated said character to "determinant" status.\n\nWhat holds for Telltale's TWD Season 2 also holds here thus far in full force: Determinant characters are effectively dead already especially when it comes to the plot.\n\nDon't get me wrong. Its still a good story. Yet it is painfully and quite frustratingly hamfisted in ruthlessly driving you down the length of its plot railroad regardless of your "choices" even when it makes absolutely no sense from any rational perspective. This is a point that bears repeating since it runs directly counter to the tagline for Telltale games.\n\nYou can only fool yourself into thinking that your actions have some minute but meaningful consequence on the narrative and/or plot. This is a terrible untruth to uncover with this modern almost kinetic visual novel style common to recent Telltale games.\n\nSure, you might argue that you can steer your character's personality at times and you get to choose their reaction to various stimuli but none of that is real outside the bounds of your own head. There is no real immersion since there is no meaningful consequences to any of your decisions in the game.\n\nThe illusion of choice is very real here and that reality can begin to wear itself into a very hollow shell indeed especially if you ever decide to revisit your choices and make different ones expecting a different result. This concept of all seemingly at odds choices blending into a single unvarying outcome grasps the essential Truth of all modern Telltale Games. It is truly unfortunate that Telltale's "New Direction" strips you of any and all forms of meaningful player agency, interactivity, and reactivity but there is no escaping this conclusion.\n\nThe bottom line is that baring a lot of people actually calling them out for it in favor of a lot more viable competition suddenly popping up in Telltale's little niche well...let's just say that Complacency is now the "One True King" of Telltale and "Long Live the King" shall be heard from their studios for a very long time to come.\n\n-------------------Summary--------------------\n\nThe Pros:\n\n+Great Voice Acting especially from the show's HBO cast\n+Good Narrative provided you buy into the false advertising of player choice affecting anything.\n+Protagonists are much more likeable and relatable than TWD Season 2 cast.\n+Excellent Atmosphere and Tension for the first playthrough.\n+Five more Episodes to watch...eventually.\n\nThe Cons:\n\n-Requires knowledge of the first three books and/or first three seasons of the TV show. No handholding. This is not an introduction to GoT!\n-You watch a group of powerless protagonists flail about...utterly helpless to affect or direct any of the events swirling in the world at large around them...\n-Lack of Substantive Reactivity in regards to your choices\n-Lack of Meaningful Interactivity with other characters\n-Plot Railroad is woefully single-minded in its implementation and often painfully transparent.\n-Meaningless choices. Illusion of choice very much "stream-lined" throughout this episode.\n-Art and Animation is overall very sub-par, unpolished, and glitchy.\n-Audio and Mixing poorly implemented and stitched together in some spots leaving a rough finish.\n-Lack of meaningful game mechanics that require player interaction beyond dialogue based "choices" especially once you get pass the first part of episode 1 which is the only dominated by QTEs and with none whatsoever once you get past the second part of this episode.\n-Of course like all recent Telltale games, there are absolutely no puzzles of any kind to solve and nothing to do but simply click or move forward to advance yourself to the next cinematic scene in the very linear plot sequence.\n-The cinematography features a lot of servicable close up profile shots of currently speaking and often completely stationary characters. Not enough of the story is conveyed through its visual elements.\n\nBottom Line: A good story with a lot of talented voice actors from the show that very professionally convey the proper tone and setting for their characters in-game but this is a good story with very little replay value since you have no agency and very little interaction as a player on what happens as a result of your actions. The game takes even that illusion of choice away from you by throwing you some throw-away line or two of spoken dialogue.\n\nThe "action" itself is limited to you pressing a single key until prompted to press another key. That and perhaps several parts where you left-click the cursor inside a circle is about the greatest level of interactivity in the action you as a player should expect in Telltale's GoT game.\n\nIf you want my advice, then you should probably wait until all six episodes are out and the "game" is on sale at a relatively steep discount before purchasing it to play once like you are watching an episodic movie...before putting it away on your Steam library's digital shelf to collect dust and be forgotten.","December 10, 2014","true","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

This is not an introduction to GoT!\n-You watch a group of powerless protagonists flail about...utterly helpless to affect or direct any of the events swirling in the world at large around them...\n-Lack of Substantive Reactivity in regards to your choices\n-Lack of Meaningful Interactivity with other characters\n-Plot Railroad is woefully single-minded in its implementation and often painfully transparent.\n-Meaningless choices. Illusion of choice very much "stream-lined" throughout this episode.\n-Art and Animation is overall very sub-par, unpolished, and glitchy.\n-Audio and Mixing poorly implemented and stitched together in some spots leaving a rough finish.\n-Lack of meaningful game mechanics that require player interaction beyond dialogue based "choices" especially once you get pass the first part of episode 1 which is the only dominated by QTEs and with none whatsoever once you get past the second part of this episode.\n-Of course like all recent Telltale games, there are absolutely no puzzles of any kind to solve and nothing to do but simply click or move forward to advance yourself to the next cinematic scene in the very linear plot sequence.\n-The cinematography features a lot of servicable close up profile shots of currently speaking and often completely stationary characters. Not enough of the story is conveyed through its visual elements.\n\nBottom Line: A good story with a lot of talented voice actors from the show that very professionally convey the proper tone and setting for their characters in-game but this is a good story with very little replay value since you have no agency and very little interaction as a player on what happens as a result of your actions. The game takes even that illusion of choice away from you by throwing you some throw-away line or two of spoken dialogue.\n\nThe "action" itself is limited to you pressing a single key until prompted to press another key. That and perhaps several parts where you left-click the cursor inside a circle is about the greatest level of interactivity in the action you as a player should expect in Telltale's GoT game.\n\nIf you want my advice, then you should probably wait until all six episodes are out and the "game" is on sale at a relatively steep discount before purchasing it to play once like you are watching an episodic movie...before putting it away on your Steam library's digital shelf to collect dust and be forgotten.","December 10, 2014","true","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

I managed to make 200 of the in-game currency within the first few hours of playing, and I don't understand people complaining about how hard it is to get them. Besides this, the game is very solid. Crafting can be a little confusing, but once you get the hang of it, it's good. You can build quite a lot with what you can get within a few minutes. The water and ice mechanics are nice, jumping feels great, and the sound effects are beyond satisfying! Building is a LOT easier than in 8bit mmo, and you can rotate the camera to get a new perspective on things. The graphics are also nice, and it runs incredibly smoothly. I'll run down a list of pros and cons for you real quick in case you don't wanna read all of this.\n\nPROS:\nGreat controls\nCrisp Graphics\nFun to build things\nWater physics are awesome\nIce physics are awesome\nSatisfying sound effects\nInsanely fast download\nRuns very smoothly\nFun to gather things\nFarming is actually fun\nYou can visit other realms freely\nPlayer-made shops\nIt's just fun to play\n\nCONS:\nConnectivity issues\nPeople can steal ONLY IF YOU ARE NOT CAREFUL\nGetting cubits can sometimes take a while\nGetting rare resources such as gold is incredibly difficult\nThere are some glitches involving anvils","August 22, 2014","true","29.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Each player gers their own little map to edit and customize, and the shop runs off of what you earn in-game (although you can purchase more as well).\nGame runs smoothly and most players seem to be very friendly.\nWatch out for glitches, and report the if you find them, the staff seems to be prety good about keeping things patched up and working nicely.\nIt's a casual buiding-block style sanbox game, and quite asthetically appealing.

I got my realm, made a house, mined stuff and then I ran out of space. That is the first problem, the little piece of land you get is so tiny I could barely fit a house in it. Second problem is the angle, you are always looking down on your character making it impossible to make underground bases because you cannot see anything! Another problem is the in game currency. You have to walk around mining trees and if you are lucky you get 1 cubit. (In game $$) It takes like an hour and 45 minutes just to get 150 cubits, and it isn't even exciting to get them, all you do is just walk around and click trees.\nSo when I was building my castle, I had to make the roof glass so I could see what I was doing inside of it. The tutorial is useless, because it barely tells you anything about the game and then you are left in the multi-player servers and not know how to do anything. Crafting is a problem too, just to learn how to make some string you have to go on the wiki and look up the recipe, and God forbid that you need to craft something else to make the thing you need to craft to craft the thing you need for your house!\nAnother annoying thing is the realm searching. If you want to go to your friends realm when they are online, you need to know the EXACT name of the realm, or else it will say, "Invalid realm name!" They could have made it easier so you could just search a username and then have the users realm come up.\nMore problems; No survival, time consuming, money vacuum, no avatar customization (Except for some clothes), if no one helpful is on the server your screwed, tedious password creating, I also once lost my deed and I had to email the admin on the server so he could go in to the game data and retrieve my deed to my realm again which took a solid day.\n\nJust don't get the game because it just takes up space.\n","December 23, 2014","false","1.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is cute and addictive and a good way to meet new friends. There is so much to do, from running a shop to building parkour. But my only problem is that when I forgot my password account details I had to make new accounts so I could actually play the game. And because I didn't want to start all over again I didn't make a new password account, so I had to keep repeatedly making new accounts. But when I finally found my original account details and tried to log in it said I had too many users and couldn't log in with any name, thererfore making the game unplayable. Is there anyway of fixing this without deleting all my progress?\n\nSo I defiantly think you should get this game but DON'T MAKE TOO MANY ACCOUNTS XD","August 10, 2015","true","49.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This just might be your thing!\n\nI would consider Cubic Castles a Voxel-Sandbox MMO, where unlike other sandbox oriented games you have a constant connection to the rest of the commuinty with online play. Players come from all over the world, and flags above each players name signify their regions. Besides building, Cubic Castle also offers Parkouring and P.V.P In player and devloper-made realms.\n\nQuest are used to help new players get a familar understanding with the game, along with a little exp. While daily quest give you a little more initiative to play by rewarding you with 50c or Cubits (the In-game currency).\n\nCrafting adds to the game, allowing you to build and create things you wouldn't find normally in mining realms; weapons, furniture, and new means to craft even newer things.\n\nWant to make tons a Cubits? Why not open a player-owned shop and merch. Don't have time? Well the game also offers a In-game cash shop in which you can purchase clothes, pets, furniture, and yes cubits.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe community is very small and mostly compized of younger gamers, which makes it a little bit more difficult for older players to enjoy.\n\nAt the time of this review, the game does have a few slight bugs here and there.\n\nThe game is also lacking a few key features that would really hit home.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe only way you're going to know if you like the game is just to play it! No one can tell you head nor tails if you have your own prespective. But, I will say the reviews for this game are on the mostly positive side and that speaks louder then any single review.\n\nSo in my opinion, yep! play it!","October 1, 2015","true","80.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

However it can be good to play whenever you have spare time or just want to hang out with friends in a game that is pretty good to do just that. As you can see with my 78.0 hrs on records I do play a lot, but most of the time im just talking with friends or helping newer players build in their realms. Im not saying its a brilliant game, but its not really as bad as many people say, you should give it a shot at least. However, I do seem to get kicked out of server probably 20 times every 3 minutes I dont know why, but I do. So maybe thats a bug or maybe just my internet connection (<most likely XD).","September 9, 2014","true","233.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Now before you go hatin' on my play time, thats ALL the time I need realize this game is very bad!\n\nIts kinda like minecraft. I should slap myself for saying that.....Minecraft was fun, and this game. THIS GAME! IS BAD!\n\nSo here is my liitle pros and cons board :\n\nGameplay : Atrocious! You build things in your own little realm for people to see. Thats it. Thats the entire game. Build things. Now in Minecraft, building is FUN! You have over 100 blocks to build! Creative or Survival, everybody LOVES BUILDING! In this game you have some drit, iron and glass. Wow.\n\nCamera : The camera is like Iphone video and Bad Frame Rate had a baby. The camera is SO BAD!!!\nIts ALWAYS in 3rd person. So thats not a big deal, right? NOT WHEN YOUR MINING! Why is this so bad, you NEED to mine to  build. Which is the point of the game. So one of the things you NEED to do is broken.\n\nGraphics : Eh, there ok.\n\nMusic : NON-EXISTENT! No track is rememberalble! Is about of just jingles and jangles. The music is the opposite of Portal 2. *BTW I reccomend Portal 2*\n\nSo, bassically this game gets a 4/10. I would make it a 2, but its by a new Indie compay I'll go easy on them.\n\nGet Minecraft Instead. If you don't have Minecraft, play this game. Just to make fun of how terrible it is.\n","August 22, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

( before release on steam ) Ive read some of the other reviews and people seem to hav judged the game by the look and not tried to research a bit...\n\nBack in beta there wasnt much, there was still much too be implemented and many bugs too be fixed by the devs but the best part back then was the comunity... No griefers, scammers or looters! Everybody where like a whole family and bla bla bla bla... Anyways it was also on steam greenlight and it got both many positive response about it having potential and negative ones about it being a MC rip off and that there wasnt much in it ( even tough it was beta and minecraft isnt original because its the most popular... ). Updates came pretty fast! We got more stuff sooner and sooner! Then beta on Ipad started! It had some bugs but after several bug reports mostly everything got fixed and u could play it smootly on Ipad! Then CC came in the que for aproval by App store! Of course it succeded because it fitted mostly on the mobile! It finnally got greenlit and came to steam! The server ( that is normally populated by 67 peeps ) gets populated by 666+ people and the game started to disconect and crash alot! After a few fixing magic by the devs fixed it and it got a another server but due to the disconecting and crashing people gave negative reviews and and started to rant at the game because they didnt know that the devs is still working on the game and will add more... So people hav been judging the game reclessly for what they saw in like an hour, accusing it for being MC rip off because it has blocks and building and saying its for kid because of the candy theme... ( did I mention that monsters is planned on being implemented, the devs actully said its on their to do list! )\n\nAnyways... Here is my point of view on this game:\n\nThis game might not be complete but it sure do hav potential! If you search u can find alot of friends in the game! The devs are not greedy! Cubits is actully easy to get ( the chance of getting cubits highers if you mine trees so its the fastest way to grind cubits, you could also get alot of cubits by looking for any resources you want ) and updatetes comes pretty fast! And you might not see it now but after alot of updatetes ( alot of updatates happens pretty fast, trust me! ) I can see this game actully be fun and after a few more it will become one of the best! Well thats just how I see it! XD\n\nWell the point is that if u look it from the front view and not from the top view you can see that this game has alot of potentional and can actully work! Its a good game to get friends and you can see peoples flag so it gives tis international feel! I give it a 7/10 for now but im having an eye on anything that can make me higher the points!","August 15, 2014","true","88.4"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

The goal of the game is to build and craft things in your world, and to this extent it is very successful. You can build a good amount of things, the issue I have is what do you do after you build it. There is not much to do once you get your world built up in a way you want besides grind (or buy) currency so you can expand the size of the world. The game is massively multilayer, in the overworld there are a lot of people traveling from world to world that you can meet and chat with.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of building things in Minecraft of some other game that features cubes. Though apart from sandbox building Cubit Castles has nothing in common with any other game I have played. It is worth a try overall, its pretty niche so you may find you really like it, or you really don't.  Cubit Castles is free so you can download and play it now.","August 15, 2014","true","5.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

This is a world things named qbees live very cute world. Money named Cubits here.\n\nYou start with a Starter Realm. If you use your starter realm when you are max level you are very noob to all players. Come on, who uses starter realms anymore?\n\nYou can customize your qbee. Well you need rare, wondrous, event and special items to be noticed. you using top hat, craftable outfit and bat wings? Noob.\n\nAlso you can design your realm like you want. You making pixel arts? GET OUTTA HERE. People looking for SHOPS. Now you need broke your all pixel art.\n\nOh you create your shop huh? What are you selling? Crown? Bat wings? Any non-rare items? PFFF PEOPLE LOOKING FOR EASTER ITEMS.\n\nAlso you can get a pet from cubit store, cool huh? Some shops selling cheaper than cubit store. BUT YOU CANT BUY. YOU WILL NEVER GET 7000 CUBITS BECAUSE YOU ARE NOOB.\n\nThere is any perks you can select when you level up. People will notice name font changed qbees and 50 level players. BUT YOU CAN CHANGE YOU NAME FONT WHEN YOU ARE 20+ LEVEL AND LEVELING UP IS SO DAMN HARD.\n\nAnd yes, you cant notice with this ways. Only one way, you need best items. You just need Monster Head, Iron mask, Dog Set, Invisible Robe, Headphones, Dark Angel Wings. They will cost DAMN 200,000 CUBITS.\n\nBut there is a way get noticed without cubits! Just be a mod! You will need 10 years to being mod. No? Just be friend with a mod. AND THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.\n\nI hope you hate this game. If you are not rich in this game, you will never get noticed.\n\nThis game is time lose tool.\n\nDo you like the game? You are saying am I wrong. You will see...\n\nI forgot to say, if you want cubits you need to buy them. Oh did you noticed this is a F2P game?\n\n-Rea Syan Cat&2byTwo","September 27, 2015","false","116.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

(Not really cheap,Id say decent)\n\nWhen i played The actual game,i expected this.\n1.A MMO building game that would open up a new era.\n2.A Hack-Free zone hangout\n3.A major parkour zone\n4.Game remakes\n\nI got two of those.\n3.A major parkour zone\n4.Game remakes\n\nThe game was worse than i thought,as you could tell.\nLets talk about the ♥♥♥♥♥♥me itself.\nThis game is a game where you play as a white blockhead in a 3D world (#GamingRacism), Anyway, The game was cool,yet it lacked the PVP/PVE MMO kinda feel.\nYes,they realeased a PVP update,but it was only wands (And the wands werent even GOOD,they either pushed people,healed people,or damaged people,All of them were like crossbows.) So it wasnt fun.\nOk,Now lets go to the hack zone.\nI played for a while on my old account,around 50.7 Hours. (The last 0.3 Was from testing the realease #FullVersionRacismSexJokes)\nSo, There were 3 types of hackers.\n1.The "Wannabe Hacker"\nThis isnt a hacker,Its more of a noob that WANTS to be a hacker,and you should report them right away,because they most likely will become a hacker.\n2.The real hacker.\nNot much,hes not the worst one.\nThese people will hurt you if he doesnt know you.\nWill Probably Ban you if you get on his bad side.\nAnd will be nice to your if you get on the good side.\n3.The "Admin"\nNow we got L33t. (#HaxorzJokes #LoveUsingHashtagsYetIsNotAGirl.)\nThis hacker hacked admin to avoid suspicion on hacking.\nYou can tell this guy by his (#Sexist) Act.\nIf hes rude yet you did nothing,hes the hacker.\nIf i was the MAJOR CRITIC here (Meaning I was the only critic that counted) I would rate this a:3/10\nReasons for this:\nThe beta was nice +1\nParkour +1\nPeople who remade paid games +1.","July 8, 2015","false","12.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

First of all the tutorial doesnt help at all. It just tells you to buy some ingame money and thats it. Than finaly after derping around in random realms I finaly figured out how to make my own realm thingy. After my game crashing like 3 times I had made a tiny house but boy does the camera angle get annoying while building! ITS NOT EVEN FIRST PERSON ITS A BIRDS EYE VIEW REALLY? WHO WOULD WANNA PLAY A BUILDING GAME WHERE THE CAMERA ANGLE IS FROM THE SKY? MY GOD. After a while some dude came into my world (yea thats the first time I ever saw a player in this game) He game me some chairs and I placed the chairs down. And than I went on adventuring around the realm lobby thing but than when I wanna return to my world BLAM HIDE AND SEEK IDIOT!Than I was done. And also removing blocks (or pulling them or some crap) makes a soundeffect that sounds like latex gloves being pulled AND IMAGINE HEARING THIS ALL THE TIME! And you like fly back 3 blocks after you pulled a block out. And the whole cubix or whatever the ingame money was COSTED REAL MONEY! LIKE YOU NEED TO PAY A DOLLAR TO GET A CRAPPY HAT REALLY? And the soundeffects do really suck as I said earlier. The only good things about this game are the cute characthers and the sitting soundeffect. Yea I do enjoy the sitting soundeffect. Also the crafting is total BS. And the animations suck complete crap. And this game gets boring really quick.\n\n2/10 only good for a short 30 minute play.","November 11, 2014","false","0.6"," 13 of 29 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","13","29","0","0"

Basicly, it's Dota 2 except you don't fight; you build. The system involving "Cubits" is basicly gems in BattleBlock Theater except they're more rare and you buy stuff with it to build with. Not a bad game, but not the game if you don't have an extra $10 to spend on microtransactions.\n\nOverall, it's not bad, I'd give it a middle rating but building games are my type of thing, so I don't like the game, but I don't hate it either. It's fun to play with if you have a good internet connection and have a couple friends to play with.\n\n\nAlso, if you HATE this game, you probably just wasted one minute of your life. ONE MINUTE. It's pretty easy to install and uninstall, just 38 MB. I don't see how you can hate this game SO much.","October 8, 2014","true","1.9"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","1"

It is very colorful, and definetely is based of Minecraft, with a bit more creativity to it. I think it targets younger audiences, but I enjoy it nonetheless. There are definetely some negatives to this game, such as the fact that making a basement is nearly IMPOSSIBLE due to not being able to move your camera down or up. Also, it doesn't really matter where you set your realm, because the realm is always the same grassy land, anyway (unfortunately). You can make T-Shirts and pants, which I guess is pretty cool. You can also buy cowls and capes, although I'm not sure  if you can make them. These are only a few things from the game I decided to put in my review. Conclusion: Definetely not the best blocky game out there, but I enjoy it. Others don't seem to, but I do.","January 17, 2015","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't feel myself getting into it as much as most other games I play, but it's a sandbox game in which the player actually exists in the world, which is usually a good start. My biggest complaints are in the monetary system being just a huge grind and in finding the metals, which are supposdely deep below the surface, but with the way the camera works, you'd have to go in on the sides of the area. Still, it's not as bad as some games.

There is no way to change to a first person view like Minecraft does by default. This makes it impossible to create tunnels, houses with roofs, etc. because my view is blocked. This is a severe limitation on what I would like to build. I have no idea why they thought that this would be a good game design choice.

I must say that I did not expect to spend more than 1 hour on this game. From playing this game, this is what I got.\n\nPro\nNice graphics (if you like the cartoonish kind)\nVery easy to pick up\nYou can build whatever you want; you aren't really restricted by space since you can go high into the sky.\nMost of the items in the shop can be obtained by crafting\n\nCon\nMining can get very tedious\nIn game currency can take awhile to gather up\nGroup mining leads to stealing (please fix this)\nBad camera positioning\n\nThis game is not terrible, but it could definately use some upgrades.\n\nMy main complaint would probably be the camera. It is fixed so you can only have from a bird's eye view. Therefore, if you have any roofs, you're wasting blocks. This is also a problem with mining. For example, when you try to mine for ores in the mountain, the ores are usually behind a bunch of blocks. However, the terrible camera angle causes 2 problems: you can't see what you're mining if you do not clear the blocks above or in front of you (from camera's pov), and this in turn results in you mining the visible blocks first, making mining much more fustrating. I think this game would be a lot better if they implemented a 1st person pov camera angle as well.\n\nI saw a lot of comments stating that this game is a rip-off of Minecraft. In my opinion, Cubic Castle achieves it's goal better than Minecraft. Minecraft sits more over the "mine for good resources" to "craft strong weapons/armor". Cubic Castle brings in many nice blocks to enhance the realm, such as the accelerating ring and bouncy block. The only problem is that it's much harder to appreciate Cubic Castle because of the stupid camera angles. However, all you need to do to play this game is hit "download" without inputing any gift card codes, paypal transactions, or credit card info. If you like creating stuff, and  this is worth trying out. If you already bought Minecraft, just turn away.","August 17, 2014","false","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some people will like this game.\n\nNormally I would love games like this. I like the building style of the blocks, but I'm not digging into my own wallet to buy more blocks. This is why I'm hesitant with most free to play games. Any other game I have played did it right this game should not require you to buy everything from blocks to cosmetic items. And I quite literally mean that, because either you have to find an area that lets you get the blocks you want or you can just throw money at your screen and hope the shop has it. If I could rate this game I would give it a 4/10.","August 17, 2014","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can trust real friends.\n4.Like minecraft or terraria, you can craft.\n5.Graphics are good.\n6.I was surprised that when I start the game, the flag of my country is shown beside my name.\n\nBad points:\n1.When crafting, you put the materials, then the result will show up, but I was a little irritated that I can't see the 3rd result item. I can't scroll it down. So hopefully, they will fix it.\n2.It may be confusing to other players who just started it like me, "scrolling camera" is when you press Q or E the view will change, by means the camera will move to left or right. Sometimes I forget this.\n\nSo there you go! of course other people has their own opinions of how they hate this game or love this game.\nLike I said above, I just played this for 1 hour I still don't know the game systems, I may be missing some bad points or good points.

Why?\nPositive : It never fails to amuse me that it onlly requires less than 30 mb to download yet it has so many content\n: It never fails to amuse that it never lagged at a point of 20kbp/s which is so wow I think.\n: It never fails to amuse me that there is actually equality ( I think ) by the fact that you actually can't buy anything haha\n: It never fails to amuse me since this is a FOR KIDS/ MINECRAFT DESCENDANT game.\n: It never fails to amuse that it is not actually boring if you always wnated to build your own beautiful, awesome, or cool kingdom\n\nBut of course it has that FOR KIDS compliment or criticism so there goes the negative features of this:\n\nNegative : It is LITERALLY FOR KIDS.\n: No other mobs except US.\n: It sucks if you don't have passion for creativity or artisticness\n: It sucks if you have always been used to MOBA RST MMORPG Sh*t (pardon the term, just an expression) then you will play a building, minecraft descendant, no gore genre XD\n: It actually has a bug of doing the logout especially when I tried to make another name, it won't allow me, then when I tried to put my real name back, it won't log me either. Seriously? But this is just a major flaw but a minor bug of the game especially that this game is still developing ( I think )\n\n\nSO OVERALL : Recommendable\nIMPROVEMENTS : We need more of the pvp and more mobs except us if you are to change your genre because it was really for kids and grandmas(pas). Especially that it would actually look good if there was the enemy mobs, good mobs, health, and other things :)","August 27, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is rampant theft, and few means to prevent it; locks being extremely expensive, doors as well, the inability to keep your realm private, and even if you hide your items in a completely closed area someone can/will manage to get in somehow. There is no real way to report these people, as well. Crafting big items is very tedious and difficult. Most importantly, however, all you can do is build meager buildings with what few building blocks are available.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/suppercut/recommended/317470/","suppercut","Suppercut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/suppercut/","143 products in account","This entire game is absolute garbage, and shouldn't be played.\n\nI started playing this game because it seemed like a nice, innocent Minecrafty game where I can make a nice challenge map or two. However, it's not. If you're not willing to shell out the hundreds of dollars on such an awful game, then it's one big gigantic competitive grindfest. It's not a cooperative worldbuilder, it's a competitive, unfriendly game. If it were friendly/cooperative, you wouldn't have to wait for resources to respawn to mine stuff up. Imagine if the game was packed to the brim with players, because more players equals more money so as a developer you always want more players. Limited, semi-permanent mines like the ones in this game would become a race for resources.\n\nBy the way, this game is fully designed to be unfriendly and caustic. You have limited inventory space, but instead of stopping the collection when you're full, it makes you slower, an unnecessary penalty for such a vast collection of blocks and items that this game boasts. On top of this, chests are insanely small, so small that you need at least six of them to hold all of the items you're able to obtain in the game, and guess what...you only have one sentry free. With all of the exploits and ♥♥♥♥ physics, this means that 75% of all of your items are stealable at any moment. Which, by the way, good luck trying to make them unstealable anyways. It's impossible to make your realm locked to outsiders, so someone could come in during setup time and invalidate your work in progress. When you're away from keyboard taking care of, I dunno, LIFE, you cannot put this robbery simulator on pause.\n\nThen there's the crafting system. Community aside, the crafting system is a ♥♥♥♥ing headache. It's impossible to keep track of and needlessly complicated. End of story.\n\nNow, let's also talk about one of the big killers - the camera. It's terrible. It's completely top-down and zoomed out to hell, which is detrimental to the game's systems. You cannot see underneath blocks that are above you, and considering this is a game with three dimensions of building, it's a terrible design choice. You can't change the camera angle past ten degrees, or zoom in.\n\nFinally, the interface in of itself is terrible. It's made for touchscreen devices, and yet it's still insanely clunky and awful, especially for mouse users. I'd hate to hear how awful it is for even its touchpad users, given they have to juggle this ridiculous filth AND use the same input to move around. You have to slide things around, which is acceptable on a touchpad but NOT with a mouse. Moving menus around should not be done the same way something on a menu is selected unless you're on a touchscreen, where swiping and tapping are much more natural to the control scheme of the device. Then there's the fact that the pulling hand is not a default item, and there is no hotkey to select it. We PC users like hotkeys. I like hotkeys. I prefer hotkeys to moving my mouse great ♥♥♥♥ing lengths back and forth to perform the simplest actions. I keep thinking it's Minecraft/Terraria and hitting 1 to select the hand, but no, I have to deal with an interface built around inconvenience. This is really a section of small problems that build up to one sorta-problematic one, and it's a problem that would be overlooked in any game more cleverly designed than this one (see Skyrim. Wonderful game, but everyone urges you to get a UI mod to fix it with).\n\nThis game actually kinda ruined my day in a way with how frustratingly bad it was. It angers me that such a game exists behind such a cute exterior.","August 25, 2014","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

If you want to play this game using the wiki is highly recommended, after you can make sense of its terrible format. This all leads to an easier alternative which is to buy items using the in-game currency of 'cubes' which occasionally drop when you pull a block. However the more advanced features, such as chest protection, will require many hours of block-pulling.\n\nThis game is cute, and has potential to provide players with the invested experience found in many other sandbox games.

You can trust real friends.\n4.Like minecraft or terraria, you can craft.\n5.Graphics are good.\n6.I was surprised that when I start the game, the flag of my country is shown beside my name.\n\nBad points:\n1.When crafting, you put the materials, then the result will show up, but I was a little irritated that I can't see the 3rd result item. I can't scroll it down. So hopefully, they will fix it.\n2.It may be confusing to other players who just started it like me, "scrolling camera" is when you press Q or E the view will change, by means the camera will move to left or right. Sometimes I forget this.\n\nSo there you go! of course other people has their own opinions of how they hate this game or love this game.\nLike I said above, I just played this for 1 hour I still don't know the game systems, I may be missing some bad points or good points.

The building is very basic and you are limited to a 3-block range making a "parkour" level very hard to make. I also see that the game has an in-game store which sort of reminds me of an Iphone game. In fact, the whole game is a port of an Iphone game of the same name. (I hate F2P Iphone games because they usually have microtransactions up the a**) The game is not for people who expect an Action-Adventure game.

But the very usefull recources are spread so sparcely that you won't gain much in one mine, let alone on the whole overworld if its crowded like it is while I played.\n\nBut I guess that's were the FTP part comes in. You can pay for blocks and other things with the ingame currency. 1000 pieces of the currency called Cubits cost about 99 cents, which doesn't sound much, but if you look at the prices you will notice that these wont get you far.\n\nYeah, you can get blocks as cheap as 1 Cubit, but these are the blocks that you can pretty easily obtain by just farming the floor of one of the mines. The really usefull blocks you can use for farming start at upt to 15 to 25 cubits.\n\nAs stated on the storepage, you can farm Cubits ingame, but I gave up on that quickly. One Cubit drops every few blocks you pickup and it gets tedious to pick up blocks just for Cubits. In the time I played the Game I earned about 80 Cubits, barely enough to buy 4 or maybe 5 rubber treestumps so I finally would be able to craft glue, since didn't find any in the mines I was farming.\n\nAt times, I really tried to farm some Cubits, but it was pretty tedious and bored me to tears, so I gave up on it.\n\nThe game has a certain charm, but in the end, I didn't even know why I should keep playing on. As I said there are alot of alternatives in this kind of genre, of which I own three and all of these have a better way of motivating the player and most important of all, have no paywalls attached.\n\nIt has no enemies, no real exploration (except of the realms other players create). At a point I was starting to wonder why my character even has a healthbar.\n\nMaybe over time it will improve, but up to now I don't recommend this game.","August 15, 2014","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But then after playing for about half a day, mining and grinding for tools and whatnot some random person comes in and steals all of our materials out of the chests.  Had NO idea that was possible since we set the realms to "friends only".  There is a thread about people stealing from chests and the devs seem to think people would rather have a "free for all" on the chest, OR if you want you can buy with the cubits or whatever they are from their "store" a sentry to lock the chests...I think they are 100 a pop, OR you could build blocks around the chest to lock people out.  Most of the people in the thread have said "How about just making it so we can LOCK them, or close out people who are not on our friends list.  Funny thing it took about the entire time I played to come up with 100 of those money things they use.   The other option the dev offered was basically this...don't play if you don't like it.  Thanks for the advice, that's the option I'm taking.  Glad it was free.\n\nIn fairness to the devs, they have stated that they are now looking into options, and in everything they were very polite and professional.","August 14, 2014","false","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nightryderace/recommended/317470/","Nightryderace","Nightryderace","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nightryderace/","122 products in account","The concept of this game is nice. Charming visuals, top-down platformer/building game, a world that everyone shares and everyone's own private realms. However, I cannot recommend it. First to get the cash shop out of the way: Most items are pretty decently priced. The problem is that a very large chunk of blocks and building materials can ONLY be bought in the cash shop. I understand the devs need to make money, but at least give free players enough to build a house at least (We can't craft a door?).\n\nThe game's description says "Forget the grind!". This is not true. You can find Cubits (cash shop currency) randomly while mining. It's not often enough though where I want to spend my time farming for it. Not to mention the loud sound that mining a material makes. Mining for ores such as iron, silver, and gold is troublesome. You have to mine out a large square, just so you can see into the hole you are mining out.\n\nCrafting is not "intuitive" as the game's description says. The only way you'll learn how to make something is by going to the official website and looking at the crafting recipes list. Which, I should add, is messy and unorganized.\n\nYou are unable to lock your realm, preventing other people from entering it. This allows people to come into your realm and steal things from your chests. You have to go into the shop and buy sentries to lock your chests. The Steam forum has a sticky, saying to block off your Realm entrance if you don't want people coming in. Or keep all your items in your inventory (right, like that's possible). Or cover your chests in dirt to keep people from stealing. Or, of course, buy a room for your Realm and lock it, putting all your chests in there. This would be extremely troublesome. I don't want to constantly be switching rooms to try and build in another room seperate from my chests. I'd also like to mention there is a sticky on the Steam forum "not-bribing" people to write good reviews for the game.\n\nI really cannot recommend this game. I want to. It's very charming and it has the potential to be very fun. But I have too many complaints and issues with it to recommend it.","August 15, 2014","false","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I didn't have enough in-game currency (that you pretty much have to pay for with USD if you want anything), I needed some resources. So I went to the many mines around . So I jumped in, and mined for a little bit. When I came back, my "realm", or world, was gone. So I went to the global map to search for it, and the game deleted my world, and with it, all my progress. On another note, this game was a mobile port, so it lacks a PC feel.

I mean come on people if we've declined so much as a race that we're too lazy to work in a video game... that's a really big problem.\n-You can block people from your stuff, for 100 cubits (in-game currency) you can have sentries that block certain people out of certain areas and out of chests!(And they give you sentry options!! A password sentry, a personal sentry where only you can access, and a friend sentry where... you guessed you and a friend can access!)\n-You can control your realm. (You get a nice little computer for your realm that controls who can build and who your friends are.)\n-You can totally customize your realm! (While they don't have a ton of different options for furniture, they have tons of different blocks to play with! You start with a forest but you can tear out every single block and transform it in to any biome you want.)\n-They give you plenty of stuff to start you off, and then some!\n-If you put a lot of effort into your realm you can get a donation piggy bank called a "Tip Piggy" where people can give you donations! A lot of the really well done realms can get anywhere from 500-1,300 cubits a day!  <--- Basically it's like real life, you put in the effort, and you get to reap the rewards.\n\nCons of  the game:\nFor a free voxel game, it doesn't have that many.\n-You can't kick people out of your realm (At least not from what I'm aware)\n-You can't freely move your realm (Not a total con, but can be frustrating when you want to move)\n-Some blocks have very little to absolutely no purpose. (For example: Soil, tree leaves --> they make soil, that's their one purpose. Though I'm hoping they have something planned for that later.)\n-The ignorant/players are constantly jumping realms and bugging you for free stuff. <--- but that's a common problem for most mmo type games.\n-It can be extremely difficult to find some of the needed ores, sometimes you literally want to just give up. (I came across some gold once by chance and haven't been able to get any since.\n\nOverall: It's a great game for being free, yes you HAVE TO DO WORK if you don't want to pay real money, but you can buy anything you want in game without having to spend real money. A lot of people complain about "The Almighty Cube" but they don't have to buy it... if they only learned to read... they'd know it was clearly a joke. It's something the really rich kids get just to show off, every game's got one of those. All in all, it's a fun, addictive game as long as your not lazy and you actually put forth some effort, can be a little tough at start out if you don't pick up really quick that anyone can waltz into your realm and take your unguarded stuff. (That includes anything you leave in your anvil, work bench, forge, etc...) so you have to either block everything up with glass or make sure you put everything in your sentry-guarded chest before you leave or anyone comes in. I've been playing for nearly two days straight and I've made HUGE progress in the game. A lot of fun, a bit slow at first but a lot of potential!

It is a boring, pointless minecraft clone without the creativity and diversity. Half of the beginning tools have materials in them that require the tool themselves to craft, making it impossible to get anywhere in the beginning without purchasing items, a process which requires hours of repeated clicking in order to farm the rare-spawning "cubits" Additionally, all the items i put in my chest dissapeared, even though it was supposedly warded against theft.

Why?\nPositive : It never fails to amuse me that it onlly requires less than 30 mb to download yet it has so many content\n: It never fails to amuse that it never lagged at a point of 20kbp/s which is so wow I think.\n: It never fails to amuse me that there is actually equality ( I think ) by the fact that you actually can't buy anything haha\n: It never fails to amuse me since this is a FOR KIDS/ MINECRAFT DESCENDANT game.\n: It never fails to amuse that it is not actually boring if you always wnated to build your own beautiful, awesome, or cool kingdom\n\nBut of course it has that FOR KIDS compliment or criticism so there goes the negative features of this:\n\nNegative : It is LITERALLY FOR KIDS.\n: No other mobs except US.\n: It sucks if you don't have passion for creativity or artisticness\n: It sucks if you have always been used to MOBA RST MMORPG Sh*t (pardon the term, just an expression) then you will play a building, minecraft descendant, no gore genre XD\n: It actually has a bug of doing the logout especially when I tried to make another name, it won't allow me, then when I tried to put my real name back, it won't log me either. Seriously? But this is just a major flaw but a minor bug of the game especially that this game is still developing ( I think )\n\n\nSO OVERALL : Recommendable\nIMPROVEMENTS : We need more of the pvp and more mobs except us if you are to change your genre because it was really for kids and grandmas(pas). Especially that it would actually look good if there was the enemy mobs, good mobs, health, and other things :)","August 27, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
