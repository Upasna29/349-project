With no input controls the game is a simple experience where no interaction is neccesary much like enjoying a VR film.\n\nWorked well on my vive system with a consistent framerate and very little going wrong.\n\nIt is a VR only game as I had seen in the discussion section before purchase, Steam could do better to communicate this rather then developers needing to addreess it post release.\n\nIn summary , its a short experience which delivers on what it was built to do and at the price of $.99 its perfect as a demonstration of what is to come.","March 31","true","0.2"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","30","31","0","0"

Steam VR only just implemented support for runtime 1.3. It does work, but the scale is totally off. Basically the player character is about three meters large. I assume this is caused by some problem between the very new runtime 1.3 and the newest beta of Steam VR and not a problem of this game. Just keep in mind that, should you choose to play this on a Rift DK2 or CV1, you'll likely have the same problem until Steam VR gets patched.\n\nOn to the game: It's really short (about 10 minutes), but it totally managed to achieves what it sets out to. It's a very simple experience without any controls except for the players ability to look around using his VR headset, but given the result the asking price seems reasonable and so I recommend this game to those who have a VR headset and are looking for a short horror experience.","March 31","true","0.2"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

To show them how the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive can draw on your fear just as well as reality can. I told my friends that if they wanted to try my Rift for real, they would have to play through this game, lasting roughly 10 minutes, as a test of their dedication to try virtual reality xD\n\nNeedless to say, I sat and tried to hold in my laugh as they played through the game, knowing what was about to come. A few of them even refused to continue playing half-way through the game, so they failed their test.

One thing I noticed is that the more recent reviews are more negative, and the older ones are positive. I have a theory as to why. People that bought this game recently are probably now acustomed to more fleshed out horror games like Dreadhalls or something , and so they probably wouldnt find this scary, and will be quick to label it as too short, or "cheaply produced". Those people are idiots, and looking at their other reviews just backs that up.\n\nThe dev mentions that this game is SHORT and a good INTRODUCTION TO VR, yet people are complaining that its not a masterpiece. The dev openly admits that this was a learning process, and proceeds are funding a more interactive game. He was kind enough to send me some screenshots via Reddit too.\n\nFirst off, I thoroughly enjoyed the game, as I could just sit back, not worry about controls, and enjoy a bit of tension. No it isnt as scary as fully fledged horrors, but I didnt pay 15 euro for it, so I wont complain. The ending leaves me wanting a bit more, but that is a constructive criticism.\n\nWhy you should buy this game:\n- It is really handy to just put it on to show a friend or a relative that wouldnt be comfortable to use controls\n- Because it is so short, it isn't tedious watching a friend play through it.\n- You want to support devs. This is clearly a learning process, and the dev has said that proceeds are going towards a more interactive version. The screenshots he sent me from his second game already shoe that he has learned a lot and has at the very least, improved the game graphically.\n\nDo not buy it if :\n- You expect a masterpiece for 0.99c\n- You expect a work of art from a dev that openly says this is his first VR experience, and was a learning experience\n- You are expecting Paranormal Activity VR\n- You have played more advanced horror games and are expecting something like those.\n\nSometimes I pity devs that have to endure stupid reviews. I swear, some of these people would buy a Fiat and complain its not a Porche.","May 13","true","0.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rkido/recommended/457580/","rkido","|AZ|Rakon Kido","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rkido/","465 products in account","I was on the fence about whether I would recommend 'The Visitor', it just felt so generic and cliched. I'm not even sure how to classify it, given that it's neither a VR short movie nor a game. I've settled on just calling it a "VR experience" as a catch-all for the various unclassifiable experiments being produced for the new artistic medium of VR.\n\nThe short answer as to why I'm recommending it is that it's memorable, in a good way. Every modern artform needs its cheap scares alongside more sophisticated works, and every new artform needs simple experiences that you enjoy when it's just starting out, upon which to build more complex experiences you play as the medium matures. 'The Visitor' is polished and well-done for what little it is. Other developers will see it, learn from it, and build better things in the future.\n\nAnd yes, if you're wondering, I screamed, twice, rather loudly in the middle of the night. I knew exactly what to expect, but I couldn't control myself. The developer knew what strings to pull.","April 23","true","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There were about 3 events that occurred and each felt equally underwhelming and gave FAR too much dead time in between. The developer clearly ignored many issues like the volume requiring to be maxed out on your computer in order to hear anything and cut many other corners. I really am not keen on the lack of care that was given and don't wish to support the developer for something that doesn't feel worth it. I am happy to fund devs for the Vive as I really believe in its future, but I think by supporting indie devs who hold little care for their products will only bring on more and lead to the Vive being something bogged down with too much shovel ware to be regarded as something truly enthralling by outside eyes. If I knew he was really trying to put out something he cared for I would happily fund him expecting him to work harder and later on create better experiences, but it's clear he does not care all too much.","May 9","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was buying over $150 in other VR games and this seemed like nothing.  I decided to play it as one of my first VR experiences: note that before buying the HTC Vive I had only used Google Cardboard type headsets sparingly. One thing I really wanted from VR was to be immersed and really scared in a game. I've never experienced that from a game, short of the original F.E.A.R. coming very close.\n\nWhen I first tried "The Visitor", I did not realize that it was meant to be a seated experience, so I was standing initially and actually walked around the room a bit. You have no interaction in the game besides just using your head to look around and point at the start/quit buttons. This threw me off because I was expecting to at least do very basic things like examine a photograph. However, as I failed to read, this is an experience and not really a game.\n\nThat being said, as it starts you can hear something walking around outside. A female voice then knocks on your door and decides to come in, walks up the stairs appearing to be a normal female figure although walking really weirdly (which felt unintentional, as in just bad mechanics). Some spooky things happen, and eventually you see "it" crawling towards you. There's about three jump scare pieces during the experience. The only thing that made me even jump a little was seeing the teddy bear appear on the bed when I turned my head, and the only reason was because the first time I played it, I played it standing up and that must have screwed up the game because it was lying on the floor beside the bed instead of in the bed so I was looking for it there. Neither of the other scares did anything for me.\n\nThe experience overall lasts for less than ten minutes, and failed to provoke any emotion out of me. The only thing I was thinking afterwards was "Why did I buy this". At $0.99 there is no reason for me to refund it or worry about it too much, but I can't help saying that I feel like unless you just really want to sample everything that is avaiable in the store, you might as well skip this title. If you are someone who jumps at everything that happens, for instance in a terrible movie like Paranormal Activity, then there is a good possibility you will find this "scary". However, it did not immerse me and I expected more even for the $0.99 I paid.\n\nPeople will argue about the small price point and say that it is not a big deal. In that respect, you're right: we spent a lot of money on a headset, and a dollar shouldn't be any kind of factor in buying content for it. That being said, The 15 minutes I spent playing this twice didn't feel worth my paying a dollar for the game, and I feel it could have been better spent towards another title. There are free experiences like "The Cubicle" available that are actually very good and utilize things such as the motion controllers included with the HTC Vive. Experiences such as this that are no more than a few minutes long and don't even utilize the motion controllers should be free for people to play, especially if they do nothing more than provide a cheap jump scare or two that don't actually bring out any real emotion.","April 23","false","0.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

To stay constructive: There is way to much time between the different events, and the buzzing, flickering lamps are annoying and take to much from the atmosphere.\n\nI would have been happy if the events were triggered by looking to specific locations. And only if the player is not doing what you need him to do or is totally lost, use the light flickers as a last resort of a hint.\n\n","May 8","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The quality is too bad. Animations, models, sound, setup/script.\n\nIt would be great if the scene would change every time you start it and every time only showing a small portion. Every playthrough should be unique in a way. That would allow a lot of more ideas to be implemented and even make the game worth more money.\n\nThe first few times I started it, I didn't know I had to reset my seated position so I was not at the right spot on the bed. It was weird enough to actually start in one. A chair would have been the better option, would actually be more immersing as well.","May 29","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's was Saturday night.. I just got my Vive hooked up from getting it from FedEx that morning. I play through the lab, and other standing VR games.. tired.. I sit down in a chair I had in the room to take a break. I scroll through the VR games (mind you, this is early on, very few games for Vive existed) and I see this item for $1.\n\nI figure, what do I have to lose. I buy it, install it.. and launch it. Almost immediately, I realize I just made a mistake. Not by buying it, but by being seated when I launched it. The experience starts with me lying in bed. And I really feel like I am there. Basically paralyzed. The scares come quickly as the sound design is VERY spooky and very well done. The graphics, perfectly scary. There is someone or something at the door.. but I am stuck in this bed. I hear it enter. I even see something come up the steps. What is it? Who is it? What happens then? I still can't tell ya.. I get scared and exit out every time I played it so far.\n\nHad you scared me once.. it would be worth $1.. but still not being able to tell you how it ends? Priceless. Great work and a real treat.","June 3","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
