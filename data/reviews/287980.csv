Is it, really? The design is minimalist, and the audio is subdued, and you can pause whenever you want - but all that just disguises what is actually one of the most deviously clever and difficult puzzle games I've ever seen.\n\nSo: Stations are little shapes on the map. People show up at each little shape, wanting to go to some other shape. You connect the shapes with metro lines, and a little train will show up to ferry people along the lines you drew to get everyone where they want to go. There's a few more mechanics, but that's 90% of it.\n\nThere are only so many metro configurations you can have for any given map, but with every station that pops up, the possibilities increase in number exponentially. There's never quite enough lines or enough carriages or enough tunnels to keep all of your passengers totally satisfied. In essence, playing this game is endlessly performing triage on an ever-growing network that's a few bad decisions away from becoming an unsustainable mess and collapsing under its own weight. It's mind-warping how fast things can get out of hand if you're careless.\n\nForget Telltale; here, every choice you make feels genuinely heavy and difficult, because they actually are heavy, difficult choices. Crucially, though, there's always a right choice that will keep you alive for at least another week. Every game ends in you frantically trying to fix a bottleneck in your network, or deperately rerouting half your lines to ease up the congestion in one distant corner of your map - and failing. But there's always something you could have done, out of the umptillion different decisions the game threw at you.\n\nThis game is terrifying. I've been pulling my hair out. The quiet bleeps and bloops of the passengers arriving and leaving no longer register as something Calming or Zen but as something far more sinister. Needless to say, I absolutely love it.","December 12, 2015","true","6.7"," 170 of 171 people (99%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","99","170","171","42","2"

These are games like Banished, Prison Architect or Sim City.  These sort of games are more about building the best thing you can with your resources available, and less about reaching a "win" state.\n\nMini Metro is a extremely minimalist version of these sorts of games.  Whereas in a game like Banished you'll be trying to balance population growth, food supplies, trading resources, lumber, etc, Mini Metro just asks you to get your passengers from station A to station B.\n\nMini Metro doesn't have saves or anything, and you can expect a single round of the game to last about 15-20 minutes.  During this time, stations of various shapes will pop up, and they'll begin to have passengers show up.  Your goal is to build your rail lines in a way that gets the people to their intended station.  Have too many passengers waiting too long to get somewhere and you lose.\n\nWhere Mini Metro really succeeds is that it builds a lot of tension easily thanks to the constant need to incorporate new locations, while only giving you minimal additional resources.  Can your Red Train Line handle an extra circle station?  Maybe you can rearrange the stations a bit to fit that new station onto your Yellow Train Line instead?  You'll be juggling these decisions constantly.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Mini Metro.  It's kept me occupied for longer than many other optimization games have.  Despite it's simplicity, there's a lot of room to improve your skills in the game, and I tend to find myself thinking of new station arrangements when I'm not playing.  That's the sign of a good game, and it's the same feeling games like XCom or Banished gave me.  If you enjoy these sorts of games, I would very much say it's worth your money, even in it's current Alpha state.\n\nQuick edit: As of Alpha 10, game now has all maps (two of which have some minor bugs) but the game continues to shape up well.  I continue to recommend it highly.","October 24, 2014","true","99.5"," 126 of 130 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","126","130","0","0"

The simple metro-line style of the game is not only a minimal aesthetic, but a symbol of civilization that is powerful to those who have relied on it for a better portion of our lives.\n\nAlthough simple in appearance Mini Metro is nothing short of a complex affair with lots of little mechanics to learn as you delve deeper. The game is easy enough for players of any level to hop into but offers layers upon layers of choice and consequence that you will need to learn and master through hours of your own planning of expansive transit systems. You begin by connecting differently shaped metro stations to other stations with similarly shaped passengers, which gets complicated as you notice your limit on Metro lines you're able to make and the amount of trains you're able to have carrying passengers. Without an even balance between how much load each of your lines have you'll quickly have a station overcrowd leading to a Game Over.\n\nOvercrowding can be avoided through careful planning as well as the help of upgrades you get to choose between at the end of each week. These can be very hard decisions as you'll be deciding between the ability to build another carriage to hold more of your overflowing passengers, extra bridges to allow you more tactical planning under rivers and other tracks, or a new line giving you a new color-coordinated track to work with on the constantly expanding map. Only one of these upgrades can be chosen and not using the chance efficiently will end your reign as a metro tycoon much quicker.\n\nThe game is currently undergoing some extremely ambitious and promising sound work, including a soundtrack being composed by the legendary Disasterpeace. Sound is a feature I am greatly anticipating, because while the silence serves the minimalistic approach to the aesthetics of the game it could really use a bit of atmosphere. Until then I can easily throw on any appropriate Brian Eno record and bliss-out to the creation of my own Metro system, And as Eno himself wrote, "I lose control and at last I am part of the machinery." Mini Metro does its part well in capturing the machine driven lifestyles of the modern world and infusing it with a tactical and addictive interactive twist that anyone from casual strategy fans to serious transit geeks can get excited about.\n\nThere's already a good selection of real-world maps allowing you to construct and plan anywhere from London to Hong Kong, as well as more than enough features like Leaderboards and alternative Nightmodes to play around with. Its state in Early Access is merely a sign of great things to come for an already blissful strategy game. I'm extremely excited for what's in store and can't wait for the upcoming procedural soundtrack, additional features, and very hopefully some new maps. Two cities I'd personally love to see are Tokyo and Prague (Hi Timmy!) and with enough support Mini Metro is sure to deliver on fresh content.","August 11, 2014","true","18.3"," 144 of 161 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","144","161","0","7"

Odds are it will be the latter.\nIt's an incredibly fun and challenging game, that will leave the player looking for the best possible routes.\n\nTransportation is the center of the world! It is the glue of our daily lives. When it goes well, we don't see it. When it goes wrong, it negatively colors our day, makes us feel angry and impotent, curtails our possibilities.\n\nRobin Chase\n\nWithout any further delay, I present to you my review of Mini Metro.\n\nGameplayIf riding a metro is part of your daily routine, you'll either be extremely interested in trying Mini Metro out, or completely uninterested.\nThe goal is to "survive" as many days as possible by having customers happy, which means providing them transportation without having to spend much time waiting for it. As you can easily imagine, that's pretty simple to do, but as the game goes on, not only will the map increase, more stations will also start appearing, which can, sometimes, force the player to redo all the lines.\nAt the end of each week there will be a couple rewards, from more locomotives, to carriages, tunnels and extra lines, all of which can be used to make life easier. But choose wisely, as you may find yourself in need of either reward sooner than you think.\nIt's up to the player to make sure they don't end up like all the metro companies in the world, full of angry customers.\n\nPros Really good concept;\nHas a feel of progression looking at the map grow as the game goes on;\nMinimalist UI, containing everything that's needed and nothing more;\nBeautiful design;\nIf you ever get eye sore from all the white background, you can also change to night mode, and vice versa;\nDoesn't get too repetitive, as the starting stations are randomized;\nVarious city maps;\nActive development team;\nPrice.\nConsidering it's an Early Access (EA) game, I've decided to add a "Neutral" category, for details I consider important, but not gamebreakers, and could easily improve the gameplay if attended.\n\nNeutral Lack of a soundtrack/sound effects (which is already part of the developers' plan);\nWould be nice to see different vehicle models, even if only for each country/city.\nNot much to point out "Cons" wise, as the game is pretty solid.\n\nCons Once you get the hang of it, it sort of becomes trivial.\nVerdictI'd give it a 9/10, as it offers the player a nice and relaxing experience, as well as a nice change from the current gaming trend.","May 23, 2015","true","9.1"," 104 of 111 people (94%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","94","104","111","11","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/287980/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","It's really easy to make a game overly complicated, so it becomes all the more delightful when you come across a simple game with a lot of depth. Every part of Mini Metro is simple and clean, from the concept to the presentation to the mechanics, but the simplicity gives way to moments of intense strategizing.\n\nEach game starts with just three stations, represented as a circle, triangle, and square. You click and drag between them to draw your subway lines, and then watch your little train zip along and pick up passengers of all shapes. Each station generates passengers for the other station shapes, so ideally you want at least one circle, triangle, and square on each line. New stations pop up as time passes, and you have to extend your lines or lay new ones to service them. Your resources are limited, however, generally only starting with three lines and three trains. At the end of every week, you get another train and a choice between two additional resources. These can be more lines, more trains, additional carriages to add to existing trains, more tunnels or bridges for crossing the map obstacles, or upgraded stations for holding more impatient passengers. The game ends if one of your stations hits capacity for too long, which can lead to some panicked re-drawing of lines and dropping of trains.\n\nActually, it will ALWAYS lead to panic because Mini Metro is insidious in how the scenarios ramp up. Stations pop up in unequal groupings, and unique stations like stars and pentagons can appear in the most awkward places. From your three starting stations the map will explode into a nightmare network of wrong stations in just the wrong spots, forcing re-draws and overhauls of your entire service just to reach that one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ station that opened up across the river in the southwest corner. But this explosion will happen so gradually, and accompanied by soothing ambient music and pleasant jingles of services running smoothly, that you almost won't notice until its too late. Like with any good puzzle game there's pressure to perform here, but it's presented in such a way that it causes none of that uncomfortable anxiety that trying to form a clutch tetris or landing that last bubble in Puzzle Bobble does. It's a fun challenge through and through, one that never gets old or tiring.\n\nThere are eleven different maps to play on right now, with each having a different layout of obstacles, different layouts of stations, and different capacities for stations. Paris and New York play very differently, for example, with Paris having a lot of tightly-clustered stations with low capacities, while New York has them spread far and wide across the boroughs. The game also has daily challenges to compete in, with everyone taking a shot at the same map and station growth patterns. There are two additional difficulties as well if you get tired of the normal game; there's a sandbox mode if you just want to draw pretty lines and work on efficiency, and an extreme mode where you cannot redraw existing lines, which makes me sweat just thinking about. If you're into achievements, they've got some good ones to keep you playing. Each city has a basic competency achievement, and then one that requires a specific challenge condition, like moving 1200 people around London using only one tunnel. If you enjoy the basic puzzling offered here, there's dozens of hours of it to be had.\n\nI like puzzle games well enough, but few have sucked me in like Mini Metro. The genius presentation using the clean subway map style makes it easy and inviting to work with. And while it certainly doesn't have the complexity of something like Transport Tycoon or Cities in Motion, I find it scratching the same itch in how well it abstracts the subway systems for each city. For fans of puzzle games this one is a no-brainer, and even if you're looking for something more on the management side, there's something to be said for Mini Metro.","November 24, 2015","true","13.7"," 81 of 88 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","81","88","3","1"

I though that I was getting a sim-style game that would let me lay out a metro system in meticulous detail, but this isn't the game that I was looking for. I do enjoy the game, but it is a real-time puzzle game, and not a sim.\n\nThere are many cities that you can play in, and each starts with three stations of different shapes - a Circle, Square, and Triangle. A station's shape determines the destination of/number of passengers that will spawn there. For example, Circles will spawn the most riders, but few passengers from other stations will want to go there. A station spawns riders in the shape of the station that they wish to go to, and each passenger boards trains that can take them to one of their destination type, and not a specific station. Your score is the number of total passengers delivered to their destination.\n\nStations spawn periodically and connecting lines to them so that passengers will get picked up in a timely manner before the stations get overcrowded is the goal of the game. In addition to the three main shapes, several unique shapes can spawn as well, which ups the difficulty quite a bit. Passengers choose trains intelligently, so not always by the shortest route, but the one that will likely take the least amount of time.\n\nEach "week" you get a new train and another random reward that could be a carriage (more passengers for a train), tunnels (the number varies), a new line (there is a maximum number of lines on each map, and you always start with three), or an interchange (increases the number of passengers a stop can handle before overcrowding).\n\nYou get visual and audible warnings when a station start to get overcrowded, and if the problem isn't resolved in about 45 seconds, the game ends. So planning ahead is vital, but you can't always do that due to the random nature of the station spawns. Sometimes you'll have a nice mix of stations along each line, and can get quite an impressive score. Other times you'll have eight Circle stations isolated from everything else and only one or two lines to service them, which is usually not enough.\n\nGames last anywhere from a few minutes to 30, and scores range from 200 to 2000+, depending on the map and the luck of the spawns. I recommend the game, but it can be frustrating when you have a good game going and three or four Circle stations spawn in inconvenient spots and ruin it. Still, it's great for when you have 10-20 minutes and not too taxing on the brain.","December 1, 2015","true","10.0"," 51 of 54 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","51","54","2","0"

But underneath this deceivingly simple exterior lies a deep and complex, although minimalist, puzzle/simulation game where you’re given the task of moving as many people as you can between huge amounts of subway stations.\n\nYou start off by connecting a couple of shapes together and each separate line you create next will have a different color. There are 3 colors when you begin; blue, red and yellow. So it’s not unlimited, you only have limited resources. More colors can be unlocked weekly at random.\nThe more you play the more stations will eventually randomly pop up. At the beginning you can manage things relatively easily, but when you’re trying to connect your tenth station or so, things can become (more) hectic. It’s your job to create and manage the lines as efficient as possible; if too many people are waiting for a train a circle will start to fill up and once it’s filled up it is game over. Should you get there in time and at the same time take a couple of passengers with you then this meter will decrease again.\nThankfully, at the end of the week you’ll earn a random award. This can be a tunnel (for crossing water) or an extra train, carriage or rails (i.e. extra color) and you can remove some of the current workload by using these items strategically.\nAnd despite all these hectic situations Mini Metro can still feel sort of relaxing. The reason for that is probably because it looks so simple and is intuitive to control. You just grab a line and drag it to the station and if there are no conflicts (like missing bridges or weird (intersecting) lines) the game will automatically readjust the rails for you. Easy as pie !\n\nThis Early Access edition is missing a couple of things that will be available in the final version of the game. The music is the most important thing that’s missing and it’s something that I sorely missed. It feels weird having no sounds at all while playing. Still, you can always play your own music on the background. And it’s really not that big of a deal anyway; I’m sure once the music is fully integrated it will be just lovely and make the game that much better. It’s just a matter of time. And just check out the trailer, it gives a taste of what’s to come. Exciting stuff !\nSome extra modes still have to be added as well. But the default mode is there (and still being worked on) for those that want to set a high score.\n\nI don’t think the game really needs a tutorial but a simple explanation would be appreciated and I think it’s a smart idea to add it anyway. You’ll get the hang of the game soon enough, but it might seem daunting at first. It requires a bit of trial and error but it’s certainly more satisfying if you set a good score later on, knowing that you did it all by yourself.\nAnd it would be nice to see a better alert if a station gets added. Later in the game when things are too hectic and you’re too focused you won’t always notice that one or more stations are still unconnected. It’s just a minor flaw/complaint and I hope there’s a way to improve this, if only for a tiny bit because the alert is definitely noticeable as long as you pay enough attention to your surroundings.\n\nMini Metro is an excellent game and a mighty fun one. If you like simulation (not just the ones that are too realistic) and puzzle games then you practically can’t go wrong with this game. And for this price it’s an absolute steal. Highly recommended !\n\n[Rating: 82/100]","August 8, 2014","true","9.5"," 50 of 56 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","50","56","0","0"

Instead of cluttering the gameplay with stats and names, everything is abstracted and simplified for a very smooth experience.\n\nI have 87 hours on record on steam, and many more on their alpha version they had on their website previously.\n\nYou start on a map with 3 stations: A Square, a Triangle, and a Circle.  At each station, passengers will appear and your job is to connect these stations so they can get to where they want.  When a passenger appears, he will appear as a symbol, for example, a square.  And the goal is to bring them to a station that matches their own symbols.\n\nThe trains themselves are smart, and will only pick up passengers that can be dropped off down the line OR allow them to switch lines at an interchange to get where they want.\n\nAs the game progresses, the map zooms out so and new stations are added.  You will face increasing difficulty in the presence of unique symbols (which reinforces the need for efficient interchanges), as well as GLUT OF CIRCLES that is the doom of all system designers (once you play it, you will see what I mean).\n\nDifferent game modes exist depending on your tastes:\n\nNormal - The standard game where you can adjust/move your tracks at will\nEndless - Relaxed gamemode where you can play as long as you want with no loss condition\nExtreme - Tracks are permanent, so future planning is important!\n\nThey also have a Daily Challenge mode where you get to play the exact same layout as everyone else, so you can measure exactly how you stack up to other people.\n\nEverything has Leaderboards, of course, so you can marvel at how some people can achieve the results they managed.\n\nNon-Gameplay elements are also polished, pleasant music, smooth/clean UI, are all very appreciated.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/fL4XX9XuTZ8","November 6, 2015","true","106.7"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","40","43","4","0"

Why then, you might ask, would “Mini Metro” be worth your time and money? How, you might muse, does “Mini Metro” stand out from the rest of the pack? Well I'll tell you why and how if you would just stop posing these hypothetical questions.\n\n“Mini Metro” is a metro designing simulator, putting you in the shoes of the world's most unfortunate subway planner. You're just sitting in your cramped office when word comes down from the top that you have to connect stations, plan lines, tunnels, and bridges, and deal with overcrowding. On the fly. By the seat of your pants. OH, and like all things in life, it is a pointless struggle. Eventually the city will be overwhelmed, the denizens of the metro spilling out into the street when the system can no longer handle it, consuming the weak, tired, and old, and converting the strong into public transit enthusiasts. At least that's what I tell myself the fail state is.\n\nBut you will fail, eventually. The key is to juggle your increasing geometric crowds, linking corresponding triangles and circles to their stations, cutting corners and making gaps to accommodate the load. And when you're finally defeated you'll get a final score denoting the days you lasted and your busiest numbers. It's very rewarding and, at least  initially, somewhat relaxing.\n\nRight now there are a number of cities to choose from and one mode, classic, to test your skills. As this is EARLY ACCESS there are some features missing, namely two upcoming modes, zen and EXTREME, and a soundtrack. I recommend putting this in window mode and blasting your favorite music for the time being.\n\nThis is a fun, chill puzzler. No bells and whistles, no gimmick. Just a sleek, minimalistic take on being a municipal planner who's getting too old for this ♥♥♥♥.","August 11, 2014","true","2.0"," 53 of 64 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","53","64","3","0"

There might be nothing mind-blowing about it, but it will be simple, clean, and, most of all, entertaining. Mini Metro is one such game to me. It bills itself as a "simulation" game, setting you the task of building up and managing a train network, but it's not really. Mini Metro is more similar to a casual time management experience, where you have to use limited resources (in terms of train lines and carriages) to juggle the rapidly expanding network, and the increased number of passengers that the network brings. Leave too many passengers waiting on one platform too long and it's game over.\n\nStyle isn’t something you would typically associate with a train simulation game, but that’s more of less what we have with Mini Metro. It’s easily the sleekest and most visually pleasing rail-themed game I’ve ever played. Modelling itself on classic underground rail systems from around the world (with maps to match) you connect shapes to ensure passengers reach their destinations. It’s a simple premise elevated by perfect execution.\n\nStations are symbolised on the map as "shapes" (star, triangle, circle, square, etc), and each passenger has a desire to get to a specific station in order to complete their trip. If they're on a station with a line that takes them directly to their desired station, then it's all good. However, if they're on a station that doesn't take them directly to their goal, they'll travel to a connection station so they can swap lines and get to where they want to go. It's a good idea to try and get as many lines to go to as many different stations as possible, otherwise your network fills with passengers changing trains and not getting to where they need to efficiently. But on the other hand, if a single train line is too long, then trains take too long to travel it, and that in turn means that people build up on the platforms.\n\nSo the goal is to balance these conflicting challenges in such a way that the train network covers as much as possible as efficiently as possible. It's not as easy as it sounds. Train tracks can't cross, meaning you need to make good use of the train stations to divert track lines. There's also a very limited number of tunnels or bridges, meaning that only a couple of track lines can pass any river or body of water. And you're limited in how many carriages you can have on the tracks, meaning you need to carefully plan for where the heaviest congestion will be.\n\nImpressively, there are a wide number of cities to play on, and each one has a very different feel to it. Japan's Osaka, for example, gives you access to a limited few shinkansen "bullet trains" which need to be carefully placed to account for the longer distance that it takes to get to some stations. Australia's Melbourne, meanwhile, has you building a tram network, which means trains move more slowly, and you'll need to account for that. China's Hong Kong builds up incredibly quickly, meaning you'll need to think much more quickly on your feet.\n\nIn addition to the very different mechanics and environment that mark each city, there's also online leaderboards, daily challenges, and an extreme difficulty mode for extra replay value. There's even the ability to export your efforts to a .gif image format, which allows you to share your efforts online, and show friends how you were able to build up your network.\n\nAs abstract as this all is - meaning you don't need to manage finances, positioning of stations, and so on - the end result is that you end up with a train network that does indeed look like real-world train networks. This is reinforced by the aesthetics, which are truly gorgeous in their minimalism. I love the look of train network maps - I actually have a framed map of Tokyo's network hanging on a wall. As such, I love the look of Mini Metro, and how quickly the network of tracks builds up.\n\nMini Metro is a fine puzzle strategy game that has just the right balance of a quick turnaround of gameplay to maintain attention and enough depth of gameplay, gradually scaling as you play, to keep things interesting. The demands of your various stations are modest and managing the flow of traffic is basic enough. But then, as midnight on Sunday rolls around, you have to choose your tools for expanding and responding to new challenges in the coming week.\n\nThere's actually not that much more to the game; as I mentioned, it's really quite simple in execution. But it is tightly balanced, elegant, and nearly perfect in execution. I think this game should be on iPad, 3DS or Vita, as I do believe it's the perfect way to get through a real train trip, but regardless, it is a brilliant example of minimalist design.","May 5","true","11.9"," 33 of 34 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","33","34","0","0"

Now it is in a (more stable) beta form, even at this stage, I still consider DPC's efforts to be more than exceptional thus far. The gameplay is simplistic and easy to pick up, but difficult to master - and that is by virtue. I think this game has the most perfect difficulty curve of anything I have played - the start is pretty simple, however, over time, the game becomes a race between land-usage (represented by the different station icons) and line-deployment.\n\nI will give this game a pass on a few things because of its beta state, so here are the pros and cons:\n\nGOOD:\n\n+ Great, simple graphics (will run on anything that can display a screen.

My recommendation still stands, just beware that some of the information is a bit dated.\n\nWhen I first got Mini Metro, I assumed it'd be similar to games like Train Simulator, or SimCity. And it is, to a certain extent. But it also isn't. Mini Metro is packed with a very minimal design, a beautiful colour scheme, and a very intuitive interface. It just looks... smooth. It opts for a very clean, non-distractive interface, which is welcoming for a casual game to play.\n\nThe gameplay is stellar. While it doesn't reach levels of complexity that Train Simulator will have, it emulates a very tough, decision making game, while still keeping its casual feel. You plan out the metro system for a variety of cities, with each city having its own characteristics (for example, Osaka features the Shinkansen, or the Bullet Train). You struggle to make sure none of your stations overflow, and at the same time make sure that everybody gets where they want to. You are restricted in the amount of trains, lines, and tunnels you have, creating a level of depth most casual games don't hold.\n\nMy only critique of the game is the lack of information and music/audio, but it's Early Access! For what it is, especially its price, Mini Metro is one of the best Early Access games I've come across. I've bought the game to support the developer, and watch the game evolve, and boy, sure it has. Updates are pushed regularily, and bugs are fixed.\n\nMini Metro is one of those games that looks simple on the surface, but has layers of complexity, while keeping its casual style.

It had to be cheap, since I was buying through someone elses account, and it had to be something you could pick up and play for a bit and not be concerned with leaving behind any unfinished saves or whatever. My family enjoy puzzle games too, so it was the first thing to look for.\n\nI stumbled across this and it seemed to tick all of the above boxes; so with low expectations due to the price, I gave it a download.\n\nWhat I've found is a brilliantly simple tower defence type puzzler which upon loading offes you a plain white screen with three different shapes on it. These are in fact underground stations that will accept that 'shape' of passenger. A graphical tutorial shows you that you have to draw a (railway) line between the shapes, and once done, a small train begins ferrying the shapes from their point of origin to the nearest station of the correct shape; changing lines where they cross in a station if needs be.\n\nAs time ticks by, more stations appear along with more passengers; your task is to keep the system running without any single station becoming overwhelmed - and each game week you can choose an upgrade; an extra carriage for a train, the ability to draw a whole new line, the ability to tunnel under water, and sometimes an interchange (a higher capacity station).\n\nBrilliantly simple in execution and with a calming appearance and soundtrack, this is one of those 'one more go' type games which is easy to play but incredibly difficult to master.\n\nHighly recommended for a 'pick up and play' game when you have a few spare minutes; this would be an ideal tablet game but until then - it works with a big screen and mouse just as well.","December 27, 2015","true","12.7"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","23","24","2","0"

You can play this on a break without worrying you'll be sucked in for hours (though you won't get bored if you did waste a day on it).\n\nThe interface is a case study in complex, context-sensitive functionality from simple interactions. Click, hover, drag and drag paths all combine to do just what you want without requiring a tutorial. Though you might spend your first game puzzling it out, it all just works how you'd expect on the first or second try. Pure, blissful affordance. If only more games thought out their interface so elegantly.\n\nNegatives:\n\nThere is a well-known "cheat" that isn't really a cheat (it's inherent in the game rules) but that renders the leaderboards meaningless. The devs are still struggling with this issue, and I think it's resolution must lie in clarifying the game's biggest ambiguity: am I running a simulation of a real subway network (in which case, shouldn't it cost me something to re-route lines) or am I stress-testing a subway plan by iterative design under increasing load (in which case, shouldn't I have some prior information about where additional stations will appear). This ambiguity is at the heart of the game's ultimate success or failure, and the devs need to do more than apply band-aid solutions and ad hoc rule tweaks. I feel like the solution is to split the game into entirely different game modes which rest on different existential assumptions about what the game really is.\n\nA little more information and clarity, compactly presented, would reduce some of the minor frustrations and provide greater insight into the network you've built. How many trains do I have on a given subway line? Can I see some meaningful data on throughput or efficiency? I have trouble believing the devs haven't read any of Edward Tufte's masterful works on data presentation. They'd do well to revisit his books for ideas.\n\n[REVISED] The passenger AI is improving. Rather than being deterministically stubborn, passengers have acquired a variability that sometimes even includes whimsical train hopping in the wrong direction and then back again. This is an improvement. There's often more than one way from A to B, not to mention that sometimes B2 or B3 offer variety. It's slightly mad, but it's better than robots.\n\nSome other minor complaints:\n- why am I limited to 4 trains per line? Couldn't that limit be a function of the line's length and/or the number of stations?\n- why can't a line go around a river bend rather than cutting the corner and requiring a tunnel?\n- why no save feature? sometimes I'm having a very successful game, but I have to get back to work, or join friends in another game\n\nTL;DR:\n\nEnjoyable game. Can be played casually or obsessively. Brilliant with the potential to be an all-time classic. Well worth full price. It would be criminal to wait for a sale price.","October 30, 2014","true","137.1"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","25","29","0","1"

Game play, a matter of laying out subway routes in a growing metropolis, takes only minutes to grasp. Yet the emergent complexity of your task leads to hours of enjoyable and quite challenging play.\n\nThe genre of Mini Metro is hard to say. I’ve heard it called both a sim and a puzzle game. The truth is it has elements of both (as well as a feature or two I associate with arcade games): you are given a map of an urban area composed of stops your train lines must connect. Your job is to choose the routes for the lines as well as which lines to upgrade with extra train cars and which stops to build interchanges at. As you play more stops are added, putting a greater strain on your system. The game ends when one of your stations remains over-crowded for too long, crashing your system. For every week you successfully keep the transit grid running smoothly you’re rewarded with a few more resources: some extra tunnels, a new subway line, etc..\n\n(Worth noting is that passengers are simulated individually. They are represented as shapes corresponding with the stations they want to arrive at. Thus it is easy to tell at a glance where things are going wrong. Unlike, say, Sim City, where an esoteric formula determines where businesses will flourish, the mechanics of MiniMetro’s simulation are overtly visible. I find this pleasing.)\n\nAll this sounds typical of a sim. But while Mini Metro definitely is about simulating the movements of passengers on a subway system, it stylized so as to focus solely on a design puzzle not on a recreation of reality in all its minutia. Money, scheduling, and staff are not part of the game at all. Construction is instantaneous. And if you choose to tear out a line and completely reroute it this can be done at any time at no penalty. Your task is simply to figure out how to lay out the pieces you’ve been given to deal with the ever increasing load.\n\nThis stylization shines in one of Mini Metro’s best features—its minimalist graphics. The entire game looks like one of those iconic London tube maps (originally designed by electrical draughtsman Harry Beck—hence the circuit-like abstracted clarity). Your “city” is composed of a general layout of bodies of water and brightly colored tube lines connecting geometric nodes. So confident are the creators of the resulting visual charm that screen capture is built into the game. The confidence is warranted.\n\nStill in Beta at the moment, Mini Metro does have some rough edges. The most prominent is the complete absence of sound. (The developers assure that audio will be implemented any day.) More irksome is clumsiness in the interface. Rerouting lines where you’d like them is sometimes rather more difficult than the click and drag interface seems to warrant. Also, lines occasionally fail to properly bend to avoid water when it seems they should.  But none of this was a significant obstacle to my enjoyment—especially as a pause button at least allowed me the time to do the needed fiddling. I still hope these wrinkles get ironed out, though.\n\nGameplay is fundamentally open ended. There is no point at which you’ve “solved” a city, rather you simply keep building until your system collapses. Nor is there any question of memorizing a working strategy for a given city: the stops one begins with, and the order in which they are subsequently added is randomized so that no two playthroughs are the same. This is where play felt arcade-like: even though your task is more typical of a sim or puzzler, your ultimate aim ends up being to beat your previous score, that is, to transport more Londoners (or Tokyoans, New Yorkers, etc.)  than you managed to last time. It’s addicting. It’s difficult not to respond to a loss with the though “I can do better” and begin again.\n\nTo sum up, Mini Metro isn’t quite finished, but it’s already a really solid choice for people who want to grapple with a difficult design problem in a very attractive package.\n\n[Disclosure: I received a review copy of MM from the developer.]","August 22, 2015","true","20.2"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","0"

Between the train and the platform. Mind the gap, please.\n\nThis is an awesome game - awesome idea and awesome execution. It may be listed as early access but is absolutely worth the asking price.\n\nEach game starts you off with three stations: A square (train station), a triangle (commercial) and a circle (residential). Each station spawns passengers which want to go to one of the three station types. As the city expands, new stations open up, mostly of triangle and circle types, but as hospitals, tourist attractions, airports and banks open around the city, unique stations open along with these attractions. This makes it more difficult to keep the metro working, but in a very nice difficulty curve.\n\nEach in-game week you keep the Metro running, you receive a locomotive and can spend your weekly budget on something new: A new line, a carriage, rezoning, a larger station, etc. These upgrades are meant to help you survive the next week. Well - eventually a station will overcrowd and you will not be able to  clear it. Your score is the number of passengers you delivered to their destination.\n\nIf you however prefer to play this as a send box, there is a mode for you too.

Where this may seem like an oversimplification, it is not, and the game is all the better for it.   Other games of this sort focus on such elements as budget and specific regions, population density and specific destinations of interest to that population; but Mini Metro instead focuses on the general and the deliberately vague; and this works fantastically given the style of the game. There is no budget with which to be concerned, there are no apparent city divisions or districts. The placement of stations is random, and also out of the control of the player. In many ways, this almost makes the goal more true to life of a real world occupation, albeit without feeling like work: somebody is presenting the player with a scenario, and the goal is to make it work by connecting the stations, and keeping people moving.\n\nThe player begins the game by selecting one of three game types, and then the city that the player would like to play. These cities are mostly without features, save for waterways. The player looks upon either an off white void or sort-of-charcoal, if night-mode is turned on, with three subway stations to connect. Speaking primarily of the Commuter game mode (the one most likely to be played) the goal is to connect these stations in as efficient a manner as possible by drawing lines to connect them using the limited number of lines, cars and carriages that have been provided. With the initial three stations this is a simple task. More stations are added as the game progresses, which serves to complicate matters. Where the player may have easily begun using only a single line to connect all of the stations, this method will lead to disaster if it is maintained. The player will have to add new lines, new cars, add on carriages to those cars to ensure that no station overfills; and all of these are in limited supply. At the end of each week the player is granted an additional car, and then the choice between one other addition: tunnels, which are required to traverse through waterways, carriages, which extend the length of a train, lines, which adds a coloured line with which to connect stations, and interchanges, which increase capacity and speedily load and unload passengers.  Only two of these additions are presented as options. The stations are randomly placed with each play through, as are the choices of additions, so memorization will not help the player. A set of options are presented, and the player has to make that work.\nThe stations themselves are without names, and are instead represented by shapes. Most commonly, these shapes are squares, triangles and circles, and occasionally 'other' shapes will appear that one could regard as special stations. The idea is that a "person" who boards at a circle station will never wish to travel to another circle shaped station. These individuals are also represented by shapes: a circle shaped passenger wishes to travel to a circle shaped station, a triangle passenger wishes to travel to a triangle station, and so forth. Therein lies the strategy: a line consisting of nothing but circle stations will lead to disaster as no passenger will wish to travel from one station to another. The player must try to connect as many differently shaped stations as possible. There WILL be some overlap and stations of the same shape connecting to one another; but the goal is to minimize those occurrences to maintain efficient routes and prevent overflow.\nThe game begins in a very calm fashion. Simply draw lines, add lines, extend lines, watch the trains pick up and deliver their passengers. It is that way for a while: calm. It does not take particularly long for that to change. All players will reach a point where chaos starts to creep in. Maybe entire lines, previously perfectly placed, are no longer efficient and have to be removed and rebuilt.  As the player cannot control where new stations are placed, and what form those stations will be, new stations may spawn close to lines that already have a pair of stations that are the same shape on either side of the new addition; and that reduces the efficiency of the line.  The alternative is to extend one of the other lines out to this new addition; but the player cannot cross the lines except by meeting them up at existing stations, which will make that extension even longer in the event that it does need to cross a line to access the new station.  While such choices represent a challenge, that challenge never feels to me to be particularly stressful.  The presentation of the game simply does not allow it.\nThe end result could be orderly, almost a work of art where transit maps are concerned; or it could look like a scattered mess of random connections; but so long as the stations never reach capacity then presentation hardly matters to the game. It may matter to the player, mind you. During one play through I had a well functioning three-lined transit system that crossed at odd intervals and zigzagged to and fro. It worked, and I hated it. It just didn't look proper. I had nobody to blame but myself: I COULD find another way for the system to work, but I had not looked for one.\n\nThe visual presentation is minimalistic. This is a good thing. Its appearance is that of a subway/metro map. The blank background populated only by single, thick lines that represent the metro rails that the player is placing and moving about serve well to illustrate the real transit maps that are out there in the world. The player is, in essence, painting the metro maps that one would see at subway stations. It is perfect, and immediately familiar to anybody who has found themselves staring at a map, plotting their subway route and transfers to progress from point A to point B. That said, those who have never ridden a subway, or are simply unfamiliar with subway/metro transit maps may be at a loss as to why this game's visuals are as they are, and it may look to such individuals as little more than lines on an empty space without knowing or appreciating the context as to why that look may be fitting. This is a fault of nobody, only the result of individual experiences.\n\nAudio. There is none. There WILL be some; but at this stage of development it has not yet been implemented. If that's a turn off for you, then back away. Otherwise just fire up some music or background noise that you feel is appropriate, and enjoy the completed music and sound effects once they are added in.\n\nLack of audio aside, everything, for me, just felt right. The challenge is perfect, the visual style is appealing and fitting to the context of the gameplay, and the package as a whole has a polish to it, both because of and in spite of its minimalism. It is a game as casual as the player wants it to be with its difficulty settings, and as challenging as they can handle until the end finally comes as one station finally reaches over-capacity. I recommend it to anybody who is looking for something with few rules to remember, that is satisfying, and well put together.","February 23, 2015","true","34.2"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","22","26","0","0"

I've kept coming back with new ideas on how to make my next play work.\n\nWhat I liked most was how I had to constantly think on my feet as to how to connect this new station in to my network but also how I could use it to ease pressure on other lines. Placing new trains required thought and adding carriages not just a straight forward decision.

The game starts you off in London, a simple town with one obstacle in the middle. If everything goes smoothly, by the end of the week, you gain access to more supplies in the forms of a new locomotive and the choice between another line besides your existing yellow, red and blue ones, or a carriage to add on to an existing locomotive. It’s simple, but charming.\nThe gameplay is enamorating and captivating, albeit simple. People (I assume they’re people) arrive at one station, and their shape determines where they go. If a triangle person arrives at a circle station, the train picks it up and brings it to a triangle station. The fact that is uses shape-people instead of real people is a good choice. The game never tells you where the people need to go, but you can figure it out on your own. The only thing it tells you is that you click and drag to create a line from station to station. I’m drawn to the minimalist graphics and the fluid look, but what takes the cake is how the game balances your situation. There is never a moment you feel that this is too easy, nor do you feel pressured that your metro will shut down. Oh yeah, if you leave too many people at a station, your metro gets shut down. That’s how you lose.\nWhen the game starts, you are given three separate lines and three stations you need to connect. You might feel drawn to use all three lines, but wait it out and just use one at the beginning. The things you need to worry about most are that you have to have every station covered well, and you have to be efficient. That’s why it is a good idea to never have too sharp of a turn in your line, it slows the locomotives down. I like to have fluid lines that never make a rapid stop. If a new station appears, either use another line that you have been saving, or completely redesign your track as you can delete all of it at once, or take tracks off the edges of a line. That’s the only thing that has annoyed me about this game so far- you can’t take away a track in the middle. If you don’t want your line to stop at that track, but it isn’t on the edge, you have to delete the whole thing.\nOverall, I really enjoy Mini Metro. A charming, bright, minimal indie game with just enough challenge to keep me coming back, and just enough variety to keep me playing. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a game that can relax you, but also offers a challenge. If I were to give it a score, I’d say an 8.5/10. I would like more features implemented as the game improves throughout early-access. It’s a great game for a good price, but I wish there was a little more to do. The only gameplay drawback is it is a little awkward to re-route or get rid of metro railways without deleting your entire rail.\n\nSo all in all, it's a great game for a great price. I implore you to pick it up and I can't wait to see new content added.","June 28, 2015","true","2.0"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

But I'm pleased beyond recognition to be part of its maturation. The concept is simple: Keep on top of a rapidly expanding metro system in a wide variety of maps (with more maps on the way) by drawing your own "map". As new stations pop up, extend lines, reroute lines, add trains and carriages to existing lines, or pause the simulation, delete the whole thing and start fresh. Each game is different, and each time you learn a little more to add to your burgeoning strategies.\n\nMy only fault is that the better you get and the longer the game goes, the tedium seeps in. But that's certainly no reason to choose a different map and see what new adventures await on that ever-so-tantalizing blank map.","December 18, 2014","true","81.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Deal with making tunnels, crowded connections, weird layouts, and of course keeping all the people going from one place to the next.  In a seemingly endless combination of options, your goal is to move as many people as possible before your mass transit system overcrowds.  Even for those who don’t like management games, this is a gem of game to play through.\n\nPROS-	well thought mechanisms to create your metro\n-	re-playability with high scores\n-	a real metro look to the maps and layout, beautifully simple and modern\n\nCONS-	slightly repetitive\n-	can be a game you enjoy, but end up leaving after awhile\n\nFRENCH PRESSED FULL CUP REVIEW\nI look down and all I see are triangles, circles, squares, and lines.  Yep, just triangles, circles, squares, and lines. I’m looking at my breakfast. It looks like my Mini Metro transit map of Melbourne. Not that Mini Metro has gotten to me, naaaah.  But look, the toast triangles are so far across my plate that if someone wanted to get to the orange juice glass, they’d have to go right through the eggs.  That’s not going to work.  Especially with my eggs making a river of yolk.   And then, how is my coffee going to get around the bacon?  I’d have to go across the butter dish with a …butter knife bridge, of course.  Wait up, what if I just re-arrange my orange juice with some straws so that it goes through the eggs without messing them up?  Boy, next time I’m just having a breakfast burrito.\n\nWelcome to Mini Metro, the seriously competent micro-management strategy transit simulation.  You start with three basic stops in a variety of geographic situations, including several international cities to unlock.  London is one of the first maps and that is where I started.  Your first three stops - circle, square, and triangle - are unfortunately expanding to locales on both sides of a river.  Well, hurry to it, there are passengers waiting already.  Connect the transit lines as efficiently as you can to keep the stations from overcrowding.  People will line up, and they are represented by the shape of the station they are headed to. Easy enough, right?  Except more connections keep popping up and you have to connect them as soon as possible or it will overcrowd on you.  Then, trouble begins.  Lots of people want to connect to the square location, but all the stations on that line are triangles or circles for several stops. Pretty soon it snowballs into a screen teaming with passengers wanting to go to a station is that is nowhere near the next several stops.  So, then comes the strategy bit.  How do you maintain these metro lines?\n\nYou have the following to work with: metro lines, tunnels, carriages, stations, and later some specialty trains like bullet trains for Osaka and trams for Melbourne.  Unfortunately, you don’t get all of those at once and even what you have is a finite amount.  It comes down to managing resources while you wait for the clock to pass in the hopes of another train to add to the map and relieve some overcrowding.  Connect too many stations and you may make the metro line unnecessarily long, or don’t have enough connections on the wrong side of the map and you’ll be overcrowding quickly with no relief in sight.\n\nThe rivers can also be tricky.  You get across one, only to run out of tunnels. Multiple tunnels can relieve a lot of stress on the lines, but at the expense of spreading your resources very thin.  I’d find myself with a few lines across the river, only to have a station point pop on the wrong side of the river where I don’t have a good layout of my lines.  Sometimes, you have extra metro lines to take care of those stations on the opposite side of the river, but only if you didn’t opt for more transit cars.\n\nYou can stop and redo the entire map, though.  That’s the beauty of it.  There are endless amounts of ways to correct the map midway.  Just pause, and retract all the lines.  You can then stop and stare at the screen a bit to see the best way to change it up.  Next, put it all back together and see if it’s better off than before.  I love this part. I’ve got total control to rethink my strategy.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nI sit back and enjoy the screen once I have a good map in motion –  it’s a bit like looking at a fish tank.  The map is alive, moving to and fro in it’s busy, independent life of it’s own.  And yet it’s got to be maintained, just like an encased ecosystem.  My mini metro fish tank.  The slightest stress on it, and you have a tank of overcrowded fish dying on you.  It’s this quality that makes the game rather relaxing, despite the endless hordes of passengers.\n\nI enjoyed the Osaka station the most, with the bullet trains involved.   Hong Kong was also quite frantic as it tended to overcrowd very quickly.  You may find one particular city appeals to you more than others.  It’s an aesthetically pleasing, calming strategic game.  I honestly, never play these type of games but I can see this being something I leave on my PC to calm my nerves after a frantic shooter game.  Perhaps it will come out on a phone app so I can play this on my phone too.  Wonderful game if you like high score games with an intelligent strategy design, feel no hesitation is grabbing it when you can.  Rate 8.5/10.\n\nDisclaimer: I was provided a review key from the developer.","May 27","true","13.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","2"

There are also fast-forward and pause buttons, so you can get through the early slow start of the game quicker, and pause if you just want to relax or chat with friends, while having the game in the background.

Not a true simulator, although it does have elements of simulation in it.\n\nA very simple game that lets you focus entirely on the puzzle without anything you don't need to pay attention to, the goal is to connect the stations and get the people to go to a station that matches their shape in an ever expanding city which just keeps getting bigger and bigger until you can no longer handle the influx of people.\n\nThere are three basic shapes- The square, triangle and circle, and you begin your game having to ferry passengers who each are one of these three basic shapes to a station with the same shape. Square passengers to square stations, triangles to triangle stations, and circles to circle stations. You then get more stations to connect, you have water you need to tunnel under with limited bridges, and eventually you will get unique station shapes to connect up to your lines.\nWhile any triangle station is good enough for a triangle passenger, a plus sign passenger will only go to the plus sign station. This means that you will need to keep your lines connected to each other as well as to the three basic stations, and that you will need to figure out where and when to transfer passengers.\nLosing a game happens when the waiting line at a station is too long, which will slowly fill in a circle around it to show you how close it is to being a game over.\n\nPassenger AI is rather simple, but it doesn't need to be complex either. They go to their nearest matching station, using as few lines as possible. An trains pick up passengers as long as they get them any closer at all, even just a single station.\nOf note is that when a train goes both ways, passengers will not get in on the one that heads away from their destination, instead waiting for a train that heads the right direction.\n\nAnd once you're done with most of this, there is extreme and endless mode. Endless mode is a game without losing, so you can relax and build your subway system without worrying about losing. Extreme mode is similar to the original game, but where you can move and remove tracks and trains at will normally, they are locked into place in extreme mode.\nOn losing a game you can continue playing in endless mode.\n\nIn the end, it is a simple but worthwhile game to play. It doesn't have a lot of special mechanics, flashy explosions or incredibly detailed environments, but all it does have works towards the same goal - An enjoyable puzzle game you're sure to get plenty of hours out of.","January 13","true","13.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It had a brilliant strategy of releasing a web-playable demo (RIP Unity Web Player), a demo so good that you could simply play it there and not buy the game.\n\nBut the guys at Dino Polo Club announced the Early Access, which I propmptly bought, as the potential with this game was really visible. And it did not disappoint. I am someone that is not much into narratives, but rich gameplay, and this is what this game offers: rich, profound gameplay.\n\nIn Mini Metro, you are the planner of the transportation system of a very abstract city. Stations with specific shapes will pop up all around the city, and characters will pop up in those stations. These characters will wait in the station for a train to pick up them, and the characters's destination matches their own shape. You will be able to lay down the train tracks and, depending on the mode you're playing, you will be able to change them to accomodate a bigger volume of people. If too many people remain in the station, however, the station will overcrowd and a timer will start. If the timer completes, you lose.\n\nThe best part of this game, though, is the soundtrack. You will not find it anywhere, except on Gameplay videos, as it is generated for all the action that is happening in the level: when characters pop up, when you change the lines layout, etc. The music is composed by the great Disasterpeace, so if you like his music, you'll love Mini Metro's music for sure.","May 2","true","19.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It shares "Eufloria's" zen-like ambiance, but primarily tasks you with creating subway lines from one location to another.  The map starts you off small with only a few locations (which also consist of varying shapes), but as time goes by, you'll be bombarded with new locations that you'll need to connect to your existing lines.  Passengers have a specific "shape" they'd prefer to travel to, so you'll need to make sure that your lines are running quickly and efficiently.

It wasn't on sale but it looked like exactly the kind of game I was after.\n\nRelatively simple to get to grips with, and pretty fun for such a simple idea. Can get very frustrating when one of your stations is full and there's not a lot you can do.\n\nI think a few ideas would be to put the colour of the station they want to go to.. could get confusing I suppose but there could be a way to do it. Because the stations are coded by shape, and some are the same, you never really know where they want to go when it gets busy.\n\nI don't notice the lack of sound as I listen to music while I play anyway.\n\nOverall a very addictive game, and well worth the £5 I paid, and I'll have fun trying out the other levels.","November 29, 2014","true","4.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I haven't been able to let this one go.  Okay, so right now there is no sound, no music and only two of the three game modes are complete, but I don't really care!  You see: the gameplay is right there already.  It couldn't be simpler.  Join the map's stations as they appear at random on the map with your available lines (you start with 3) - simple.  That's it.   Ha ha ha ha ha.........  Yeah, right!\n\nThis game is maddeningly addictive, be warned!  I can't put my finger on why, but I can't leave the game alone.  When you are rewarded, should you take a new line colour, a tunnel or a carriage (yes, just ONE carriage so you'd best add it to whichever train needs it most - correct answer is ALL of them!  Too bad).  To make things more complex, there are rivers and your lines can only span rivers if you have enough tunnel points (you soon won't)!  And just as you sit back to admire your beautiful network of circular, triangular and square stations all running a seamless service - up pops a hexagonal, slice, star or cross-shaped station!  These specials only pop up once, and it really matters where you add these (because you'll soon have a lot of shapes crawling around your network trying to reach them).  At the end of each game week, you are rewarded with an extra locomotive, and a random choice between an additional line colour, a tunnel point or an extra carriage.  You'll actually need them all.  Again, too bad, so sad...\n\nThe simplicity of the GUI is wonderful.  You can drag lines around, stretching them any which way in zen-like fashion to join up stations as they inconveniently appear on your map.  You can erase lines and rebuild (you'll do that a lot)  Your only goal is not to let any station become too busy - dead simple - except it  isn't!  Already there are tactics evolving in the forum for making temporary lines to shift the load, but that's rather like rearranging deck-chairs on the Titanic.  Your game WILL go down in a Game Over screen.  Get used to it - you'll see it a lot!\n\nDespite this game not being finished, it is already excellent and worth that weeny £4.99.  I'm told that buying direct through Humble will also net you the upcoming Android version (I missed that one).  This is one of those rare gems that is hugely addictive, simple yet clever.

With many early access games I can play it for hours and begin finding errors, or getting ideas of how the game could be made better. And why not? It's Early Access! That's the name of the game, right?\n\nThen I played MiniMetro, and I expected bugs, crashes and a dire need for polishing. And, aside from the lack of audio, I found... Well, a brilliant game. There's already plenty of maps, with more to come, and the simplistic nature of the game itself is polished to perfection.\n\nThis game places you in control of an entire cities' Metro network, ferrying civilians from Stop A to Stop B, as indicated by various shapes. So, for example, there could be multiple people at a stop wanting to get to a Square stop. They will get on the line that has that stop available. As time progresses more stops appear randomly around the map, each with different shapes. As stations demand more stops, you'll quickly ecounter the enemy of the game: over-crowding, which you'll quickly learn is as big and scary a final boss as any other game you'll come across. All you have to do is 'survive' the week to unlock more trains, bridges or routes to be able to satisfy the need of every customer. Once you lose, and you will, your high-score is how many passengers you managed to take from A to B, and the days your service was up and running. It's a very simple and fitting scoring system that leaves you with a burning desire to play again just to beat those numbers.\n\nAs time goes by you will learn to love or hate certain shapes, with particularly rare shapes getting high demand, but being in a particularly hard to reach location. I have come out of many playthroughs wishing circles were never invented, and that Triangles are satan-spawn.\n\nThe pacing is fast and challenging, the only reprieve you can find being in the Pause button. The art style is minimalist and simplistic, obviously reminiscent of an Underground map. The replayability is seemingly endless, with stations appearing at random locations each time, alongside various different maps each with their own individual high-scores.\n\nI love this game, it's worth every penny, and it should be considered a complete game with incoming updates as far as I'm concerned. While it's still in Early Access though, I will suggest one thing that would be nice but is not entirely necessary: Stats for each station/line to see how many passengers are travelling on each, allowing you to micro-manage everything much more meticulously.\n\n10/10","October 27, 2014","true","3.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

This game puts you in charge of connecting railway lines to circles, triangles, squares etc and your job is to make sure none of those stations get over crowded which seems simple enough and after the first 5 or so minutes of play you will believe that this game is easy but soon you will realise that it is not all that easy as more stations are made and passengers are made faster making you think constantly of a better way of handling the situation at hand. Will you make annother line to take the load of annother? Will you add more trains to make one line more effective? Will you add more carriages to your trains so they can carry more? Will you add more tunnels so you can get to those areas on the otherside of the lakes? You will have to make all these decisions in this game.\n\n-Gameplay-\nThe gameplay is very simple, you draw lines to shapes and deliver shapes to other shapes. You have to make sure no stations become over crowded or you lose the game. The score is determined by how many 'peeps' you have delivered. You will get a train and a choice between 2 upgrades at the end of the week, currently there are (2 Tunnels, a carriage or a new line) these get randomised each week and you have the choice between 2.\n\n-Conclusion-\n\nOverall the game has a great concept and is executed very well with only a few missing features. Music is a main thing currently not in at the time of this review but of course this will be implemented in the future. I give this game a 9/10 for being unique, fun, exciting and overall intense as you make those quick second decisions. I can see this game going a long way with the 'Wishfull' features that may be implemented such as 'Multiplayer' 'Scenerario Editor' and more. If you are looking for a game you can sit down and play for 20 minutes then this is definately it. I Highly recommend checking this game out especially for the low price it is at.\n\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ8UJiMz0cI","August 10, 2014","true","2.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

When I first saw this game I though that just drawing lines would not be fun at all. Now, I Mini Metro is one of the cheapest, yet best games I have bought on steam. For just $6 this game is  really well made. I think for the basic concept of making a underground system this game can bring you hours of playing. Time will fly when you play this game. It is also very simple to learn. You literally just move your mouse and draw lines and sit and relax. In Mini Metro you have a limited amount of lines, trains, and underwater tunnels. You can play for a minute or for two hours. If you have been to any city or place this game features you may have some familliarity to the map. I think it is a great value for such a cheap game.

I bought it in a recent Humble Bundle for it specifically and after a few hours I'm comfortable giving it a thumbs up, despite the criticisms that I am now about to lay out.\n\nMy first caution is that, while the game is well designed and enjoyable, its content is a little thin for the sticker price of $10. There are 12 cities, and while there are some unique quirks between them, the only other practical difference is where the rivers are located. Most end up playing pretty close to the same way. It will still take you a while to invent and explore all the possible strategies for building your metro, but after about 10 hours I found my interest waning as there wasn't much else to spice things up. The three game modes help in this regard.\n\nThat said, what content is there makes for quite a challenge. It's a perfect example of a game that gives you a small set of tools that can be combined to make incredibly complex systems.\n\nI also see some room for improvement with the UI. I like the game's minimalist graphics, but the interface takes this a shade too far. There were a few things that bothered me:\n\n1. Trains/carriages are a bit hard to see, being the same color and only slightly larger than the tracks, and often obscured by other objects. It's very difficult to see where everything is at a glance. Something to help them stand out, like a black outline, would be a big help.\n2. The stations have the opposite problem. They stand out well, but they're all the same color, differentiated only by shape. It's easy to lose track of where specific stations are since many look alike.\n3. Some more feedback in the UI would be nice (at least in sandbox mode, if it would make things too easy on normal/expert). Perhaps some summarized info about each line, like number of passengers waiting, number of trains/carriages active, average wait time. There's a stats page that has some of this info, but it's on a separate screen several clicks away.\n4. Speaking of the stats page, the minimalist design doesn't work so well there. Having to mouse over each data point to see numbers does not for easy reading make.\n\nIn conclusion, Mini Metro is a simple but deep game that plays pretty much as advertised. Perhaps a bit lacking in content for full price, but still a solid pick for anyone who likes puzzle/strategy type sims.\n\nEdit: The more I play this game, the more I crave more features. I love the challenge but it's actually kind of frustrating how many times I think "gosh it would be nice if I could do X to make my metro more efficient", but alas, X is beyond the scope of gameplay. This really is perfect as a casual, pick-up-and-play mobile game, but if you're used to more in-depth sim type games, proceed with caution.","May 5","true","22.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

The art style is simplistic, and the gameplay is basic. You are in charge of a city subway system, and are responsible for transporting people from one station to another. You lose the game if you let the stations get overcrowded. The game is time management based, with new upgrades available every week when you successfully complete a week as a reward. There are a multitude of different levels and content, and each map of mission has its own leader-board, which can add to the competitive feeling as you play.\n\nThere are daily challenges, which is appreciated, but there is no expected level of completion, such as 500 people transported. This I feel takes away from any incentive a player might have towards these goals. The leader-boards for these challenges show the top 10 people, but don't give motivation or incentive for what you have accomplished on a personal level as games are meant to be personal.\n\nAnother aspect that may only appeal to certain players is that the game states directly that you cannot win. There is no end game. The game keeps growing, with new stations, complications, and population, to the point that you will not be able to keep up. You will not be able to grow your subway empire, simply manage the time you have to the best of your capability. If you enjoy time management games, this might be for you; the game is very basic- a simplistic casual game for those who find casual games too demanding.\n\nThe game mechanically give you exactly what it promises. For the current asking price of $10 dollars, I cannot recommend it, but if it were on sale, and this type of game appeals to you, then go for it.\n\nThis is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watch\nif you are looking for a more in-depth review.\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/c/SocioPsycho","November 21, 2015","true","1.8"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","65","11","17","5","0"

Simplicity at its finest.\n\nThe idea is simple: get passengers from station to station by building railways.\nThe UI is simple: Click and drag to draw railways through stations.\nThe rules are simple: No more than four trains on one track, and if any station gets overcrowded you lose.\n\nFrom these simple principles emerges chaos. Sheer, utter, beautiful chaos - fueled by the ever increasing number of stations you have to cater for, and driven by hasty changes to your Metro to try and provide routes for passengers to take in order to get to their destination ASAP.\n\nAnd yet, despite how chaotic things get, you can still employ strategy and make reasoned decisions at every turn. At the start of a new game you might choose to stick to one design philosophy or another, leading to experimentation to see which is the most effective.\n\nThis, coupled with the randomly generated stations, makes the game very replayable and, if you appreciate the slow pacing, very fun.\n\nDespite this, that's all there is to it, really. After 2 or 3 hours of play you've pretty much seen it all. I imagine, after a few more hours of play, I'll probably get a little bored. In my mind, it's something I'd return to whilst waiting to do something else - in a role similar to Super Hexagon.\n\nHighly recommended if you're looking for a fun little game to play whilst rendering a video or waiting to do something else.","August 14, 2014","true","7.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's a very relaxed puzzle game, in which you link lines from different types of stations in order to allow passengers to reach their desired type of destination. As the game goes on the map slowly expands and adds/changes stations to force you to keep expanding/upgrading. I recommend just ignoring the score and let yourself just focus on trying to find the best way to flow the traffic for as long as possible. Mini Metro is great for when you just want to relax; personally it’s good for recovering from rage-inducing moments other games cause.\n\nPros:\n-Simple, Zen-like game\n-Minimalist graphics that are spot on for the theme.\n-Easy to learn, plenty of ways to try and experiment with the growing map to keep going.\n\nCons:  (Since the game is beta, these will likely change in time)\n-No tutorial yet, so most the ways you can interact with the board have to be figured out on your own.\n-No sound effects/music. The music is simple to solve, but other audio effects would be nice.\n-If you’re still reading, 15 points to Gryffindor. (Bloody gits)\n\nMy tip for figuring out the controls: Experiment of course. You can click-drag about anything (stations, ends of lines, mid-lines) you don't like, It'll Highlight/grey out if you can/cannot do something respectively.\n\nCurrently, the lack of audio is a downer, but the minimalist art style (and Zen theme) go well with a bit of Jazz.

If you enjoy looking at subway maps and playing an engaging puzzle game - then this game could be for you.  The gameplay is simplistic yet challenging.  As time progresses, subway stations appear "randomly" and you are tasked with connecting the stations to one another by drawing subway lines in any way you see fit.  Different stations consist of different shapes you'd typically see on a subway map (i.e. dots, squares, stars, etc.).  there are a limited number of trains, carriages, and tunnels at your disposal and every game turn (one week) you get to choose what you would like to buy.  Sometimes, it pays to buy an additional subway line to start a new line with or sometimes it pays to buy an extra carriage if there are a lot of passengers at your existing lines.  And always keep track of those river crossings with tunnels - make them count as you can only do so many of them each game (unless of course you buy more each game turn).  What keeps the game fun, fresh, and engaging for me is the ability to change subway lines as additional stations randomly appear - you are not stuck with what you originally drew.  You have the flexibility to continue to change and evolve your strategy and layout of your subway grid as time goes on and passengers appear in greater numbers.  This mechanic is what keeps the puzzle game aspect engaging - rather than just an exercise of draw some subway lines and sit back and watch the map come to life (which can be fun too!)\n\nSince the game is early access, they currently have London, Paris, and New York City to start with but there are additional cities (such as Sao Paulo and St Petersburg) that are greyed out but should be playable soon.  Also, sound is currently disabled and there are other game modes not enabled but this is something to look forward to has development continues.","August 16, 2014","true","8.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The game can be quite repetitive, but as someone who likes playing task-oriented games, it's perfect for me.

From time to time smaller icons like a circle, square, triangle etc. appear next to these metro stations.\n\nThose smaller icons respresent a traveler who would like to go to another metro station. For example, a smaller triangle on a circle metro station, would like to take the metro to a traingle metro station. If the traveler steps in, it will not go out until it reaches a triangle station. But it will step over on a different line if it can reach such a station faster.\n\nWhen you start you will just have a few metro stations, and a few lines. Every week you get more lines / locomotives / carrages or tunnels. Somethimes you will get a choice if you want for example a new line, or a new locomotive.\n\nYou also have different maps to play, that are named like cities, like London, Paris, Hong Kong.\n\nAlso in the game you only use the left mouse buttons, that is everything.\nI would say a great game if you would like a simple strategy game, but you also start a new map very soon.

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of an intriguing little puzzler, Mini Metro. Mini Metro was officially released onto Steam on November 6th, 2015 by Developer/Publisher Dinosaur Polo Club and Publisher AGM Playsim.\n\n(NOTE: This was a review from a game in my own Steam library, it was NOT provided by the Developer and/or Publisher)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/-UjlPVTLEoE\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nFantastic little puzzler. The art-style and music are enchanting. Easy to play, hard to master. Addicting 4/5\n\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nI wasn't quite sure what to expect with this little thing. A transportation puzzler. Open and run lines to maximize efficiency. Seems simple enough, right? Especially since this isn't crazy detail, it's just lines and shapes. You get rolling, and there's this catchy, soothing music that gets going along with your lines and station placement....next thing you know, you just can't stop! You've got lines going everywhere, you're hoping to level up then dreading the decision of which perk you want (More Tunnels or a Carriage? Another Line or an extra Locomotive?). It can get rather intense on you pretty quickly. There are different levels of difficulty, daily challenges, high scores, scenario unlocks, etc. There is a ton of replayability. The visuals and the music are pleasant, enchanting and beautiful. Very nice touch for a little puzzler, really. I also genuinely thought I would take issue with the $10 price point, but cannot see a problem with that. now It is worth $10. I keep going back. It is nearly impossible to play just one attempt. 4/5 stars for this one, gamers. It's so much fun, once you try it you will get hooked!\n\n\nHappy Gaming!!!","November 28, 2015","true","2.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It is so hectic and yet Zen and peaceful. Like many of my favorite games, it's more about what's happening in your head than what's on the screen.\n\nThis is a traffic routing game where you draw subway lines to take little shape people to the matching station shape. People appear in real time, but you can pause and redraw your map at any time. You use little rectangular trains, a few colors, a few bridges to cross rivers.\n\nThe art is straight out of the classic London Underground map. But you get to make the map, in a stylized but real world city with its geography (eg London, Paris, Berlin, New York).\n\nAs you deliver more passengers, you meet the challenges of growth. New stations crop up in outlying areas, forcing you to take apart the ingenious system that worked so well before and think again. New shapes of passenger and station appear, making it impossible to service all shapes with any one line. But they will transfer along the shortest route, which means you want your trains to meet at some stations. Mix in a long haul train line? Maybe you want to add a passenger car to accommodate all the people that build up as it makes its slow way.\n\nThe stations and demand are randomly placed every time. The gameplay is the same every time, but the random map constantly challenges your understanding of these systems.\n\nI'm having a great time with it.","September 5, 2015","true","7.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Boy am I glad I did! This is a fantasic, little, indie, strategy game where you are managing a subway station. Your job is to lay down subway lines to connect the different stations and get the different shapes (people) to their desired destinations. It starts off slow and progressivley keeps adding more and more, so you really have to think about where to place the lanes to be the most efficient. It's super easy to learn, but will take some time to master, and it's absurdly addicting.\n\nThis is an early access game but complely 100% playable. There is no music/audio yet, but that will come out soon. They use a very minimalistic art syle, which adds to it's clean look and makes it easy to understand, however, a few things might need to be clarified. Hopefully they will add a small description for the different items you have to choose from between weeks. There are a few I'm not completly understanding what they do or how they work.\n\nThe beginning tutorial is very simple, although they do not show you how to move tracks or divert them. I kinda found that out by accident, so hopefully they will expand on a few of these things.\n\nI also hope they make it possible to save some of your games/city tracks you have made in a future update.\n\nOverall this is an awesome little game, that is well executed, and 100% worth the full asking price. 10/10","June 17, 2015","true","1.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/turinwing/recommended/287980/","turinwing","Perdix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/turinwing/","148 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTL;DR - Mini Metro is a top-down iconographic map-planning and resource-management simulation in which you build a metro system that somehow manages to pop new stations up at an alarming rate.  Your only resource is time, and you will eventually lose - the satisfaction in this game comes from creating a well oiled machine.  I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoyed building transport networks on Simcity 4 or find themselves building all possible city improvements in Civ just because they like to see the city doing well.\n\nThis (as of writing) is a game in Beta, but still thoroughly enjoyable.  Your task is to create a metro network by facilitaing the transport of shaped passengers (circle, square, triangle, star etc) with the same shaped stations.  This is done by connecting the station shapes with a coloured transport line - a train will automatically carry passengers back and forth along the line's length.\n\nThe difficulty comes from the fact that each station can only so many passengers - and once a station has been full for 30 seconds, it's game over.  This becomes more and more likely as the map progressively bigger, more stations are added, and more shapes are included - your only tools against this are earned at the end of each week; more trains, more lines, and more carriages.  To throw one more spanner into the works, each map contains a river which can only be travered through the use of 'tunnels' - again, only to be earned at the end of each week.  This causes  for some very difficult decisions to be made about whether you should pick more trains to add to your system, or whether you're going to need to get over the river with one of your lines before the week is out.\n\nThe aesthetic mirror's the current London Underground colouring and angling - meaning that even when you end up losing the game, looking back over your map is a fairly satisfying experience.\n\nI definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys intense resource management and optimising pathing; the skill in this game is in weighing up many different routes simultaneously and evaluating which is the best.  An oddly satisfying experience all the way through; one that will be even better once the music and sound effects have been added into the game.","August 22, 2014","true","17.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You have to connect all the stations together and get all the passengers to where they want to be without the stations getting crowded. The maps slowly expand revealing more play area to which more stations open up for you to connect to. You can make numerous train lines or add more trains and carriages to existing lines to help transporting passengers.\n\nThere are numerous levels to play on, each with rivers where you have to make tunnels through, despite the limited supply. You get a train given to you every week and a choice of an extra tunnel, carriage or train line to get to help you win. Even though it looks easy, it isn’t really. They added an extra mode which is the equivalent of a sandbox mode, where the stations can get full of passengers but the game doesn’t end, this allows you to just build and deliver passengers as you please, while still working with the limited supplies. They plan on making another mode which will be hard-core, only for experienced players, more cities, customers but maybe less or normal amount of assets.\n\nMini Metro is In Early Access currently (time of review posting) and therefore isn’t finished, a simple game with lots to do. Despite the lack of music, there are big plans for the future and it’s exciting to imagine what comes next. The game comes with the ability to change between colour-blind mode and not colour-blind mode, meaning that players who have trouble with colours can still play the game. There is even a Day and Night mode that changes the colour of the game, white for day and black for night so it doesn’t hurt your eyes. These two features aren’t given often in games but should be added for those who need these options.\n\nThis game, despite its easy looks it is quite hard, and that’s something you don’t see much anymore, hard games that look easy. Dinosaur Polo Club have developed a game that is really fun and challenging, something that strategy game lovers need in their steam library.\n\nI rate this game a 9/10. Not a 10 because of the lack of features, but since it’s an Early Access game, a couple more updates and it’ll be a 10/10.","October 8, 2014","true","17.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You have to connect all the stations together and get all the passengers to where they want to be without the stations getting crowded. The maps slowly expand revealing more play area to which more stations open up for you to connect to. You can make numerous train lines or add more trains and carriages to existing lines to help transporting passengers.\n\nThere are numerous levels to play on, each with rivers where you have to make tunnels through, despite the limited supply. You get a train given to you every week and a choice of an extra tunnel, carriage or train line to get to help you win. Even though it looks easy, it isn’t really. They added an extra mode which is the equivalent of a sandbox mode, where the stations can get full of passengers but the game doesn’t end, this allows you to just build and deliver passengers as you please, while still working with the limited supplies. They plan on making another mode which will be hard-core, only for experienced players, more cities, customers but maybe less or normal amount of assets.\n\nMini Metro is In Early Access currently (time of review posting) and therefore isn’t finished, a simple game with lots to do. Despite the lack of music, there are big plans for the future and it’s exciting to imagine what comes next. The game comes with the ability to change between colour-blind mode and not colour-blind mode, meaning that players who have trouble with colours can still play the game. There is even a Day and Night mode that changes the colour of the game, white for day and black for night so it doesn’t hurt your eyes. These two features aren’t given often in games but should be added for those who need these options.\n\nThis game, despite its easy looks it is quite hard, and that’s something you don’t see much anymore, hard games that look easy. Dinosaur Polo Club have developed a game that is really fun and challenging, something that strategy game lovers need in their steam library.\n\nI rate this game a 9/10. Not a 10 because of the lack of features, but since it’s an Early Access game, a couple more updates and it’ll be a 10/10.","October 8, 2014","true","17.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Watching your network run is just mesmerising, even with no sound. I can see myself spending many sleepless nights playing this. This has unbelieveable build quality for a beta, in the 10 hours I've played I've only encountered one 'maybe' bug (In Zen mode the weekly funding stops suddenly.) I can only imagine how incredible this game would be when it is ready for release.  The only minor gripe is that I wish that there was a true sandbox mode where you can create your own map, actually have control of station placement, and be able to name your lines and stations. But that doesn't really affect my enjoyment of this game.

You build a subway and if you make it through a week without overcrowding any station you get another locomotive and a choice of upgrade from between two items. You usually really need both and it makes it hard to pick.\n\nSomewhere in week five you have a jump in diffcultly where you have to scramble to keep everything going. I save a carriage and a locomotive just for that hump. You keep growing and growing until you have a station overcrowd and you fail. I can usually go four or five games before I get furstrated with failing. I've played hours on the beta version before they came to early access. I was happy to play until I quit in furstration and come back to try again later.\n\nThere is supposed to be a zen mode coming. When that hits I'll be playing lots more.\n\nThe delevopers are very good about feedback. I mentioned my family needed a colorblind mode and they were very good about asking what would make it easier for us. I've seen where things I've suggested (that I'm sure others suggested too) have been implemented already.\n\nThis is early access done right.

I had the good fortune of stumbling over Mini Metro whilst reading about one of the Ludum Dare competitions (26 I believe); the game is a successor to 'Mind the Gap' a game of a similar premise.\n\nThe simple design and user interface will no doubt sit well with players, although I do wonder why there was a shift from the old in game menu which in many ways--was simpler--a simple flick to the left of the screen would bring it up. The actual gameplay is very good. Your objective is to maintain your underground system for as long as possible without too much overcrowding. If a station incurs too much congestion for more than thirty seconds, game over.\n\nI cannot be certain as the game is still in pre-release, but there seems to have been some nerfing of gameplay in the form of bonuses you acquire at the end of the week. You now gain a new train every Sunday but there seems to be a lack of station upgrades. One of the things I was expecting was more choice, rather than less.\n\nSome features are currently unavailable but in the works; maps and music come to mind. I'm looking forward to seeing those implemented over time. I caution Dinosaur Polo Club about adding new maps as DLC though (I still see a fairly lackluster amount of additional maps to be unlocked as the game is updated), and I hope we as players are buying the full game, rather than half of it!\n\nOne last point of contention is the game's varied art style. Some maps are very minimalist such as London and Paris, with a plain white background. Others, such as Cairo and New York are yellower and although this is a very very small point, I can't tell if this inconsistency is good or bad yet.\n\nOver all Mini Metro is a solid game, especially for the price, well worth picking up!\n\n8.5/10","August 11, 2014","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But it's already a fully playable (and enjoyable) game.\n\nMini Metro is a minimalist game, in the sense that:\n- the goal is simple (keep your metro network working as fluidly as possible)\n- the gameplay elements are simple (as time goes on, you gain more lines, train, tunnel...)\n- the ergonomics are simple (draw a line between two stations and you've built a new metro line ; click and drop a train on a line and it'll immediately work on its own schedule)\n- the look is simple (as you can see, the visuals are inspired by subway maps you can find all around the world)\n\nBut a minimalist game isn't a simple game. Each station has a specific shape. Imagine that a circle represents a residential district and that a triangle represents a business area. Passengers will then tend to go from a circle to triangle. And back. But as time goes, new shapes appear. And it really feels like if a city was blooming before your eyes. Again, imagine that a square is a commercial district, a star is a tourist area,  a diamond is an airport... Some of the shapes will appear in large numbers and close together. Others will be scarce but will be a favorite destination from all around the map. Again, just like in a real blooming city.\n\nAdd to that the fact that a dozen of real life cites are present in the game, each with a different feel, different tools, different obstacles.\n\nTo put it simply, the game is already perfect as it is. But it's still quite hard to explain and you really have to experience how it works, for it's both a very stressing and demanding game and a most contemplative and artistic pice of work.","September 4, 2015","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I loved it, but there was a lot missing, which was expected for such an early version of the game. I forgot about for a long time, and when I remembered how the game was fun, I decided to check it out, since it was officially released. The game is great! It's pretty casual, the sounds are great (and I personally love how each new line has it's own sounds), and there are almost no problems, the only one I've encountered in 3.8 hours of game was that the sound glitched and turned into a one-tone buzz that was only fixed by restarting the game.

It's one that might come up behind you and say something like, "Hey, I'm single..." and creep you out, so you might be not that keen of it if you just look at the outside (trailer, screenshots, etc.) I know I wasn't! But then, one of my friends bought it and recommended it. He told me to give it a go. I did. I immediately fell in love with this game. It's one of those games you play a little each week or month and you keep coming back to it now and then. Unlike COD or CS:GO or TF2, it's one that you play a little at a time, not 12 hours straight!\n\nRATINGS:            Subject        Score                Gameplay        9/10                Price        10/10                Difficulty        7/10 (10 is easy)                Audio        58/10*                Overall Rating        8.5/10\nNOTES:• *Audio, as of writing, has been implemented less than a week ago.

There's not much else to it other than daily challenges with leaderboards, a mode that makes all your tracks permanent and a mode that disables terminal overcrowding. It's kind of like if Train Valley was a survival game.\n\nThe two main problems are that the music (which is automatically generated from train movement and passenger sounds) might get grating after a while, and stations popping up seemingly randomly enough that games are as much up to chance as they are up to your on-the-spot problem solving ability. That last one's not so much of a problem if you can handle stress and are good at performing triage, but Cities in Motion this ain't.

I SEE THE JOKE HERE."\n\nBrought the game on the strength of that joke alone. However, the game is strong enough on its own merits that I'm very pleased with my purchase. On endless, you've got a fantastic idle game you can fiddle with while listening to a podcast, trying to up your efficiency. On normal, you've got an intriguing puzzle that requires your constant attention, analysis and problem-solving skills [along with the occasional gamble] as you try and make sure that the people flow so as to not get left standing on a station to the point where their complaints get you shut down.\n\nAs a side note, I like to imagine that this represents the complete anarchy of people who're waiting on a station platform for too long. An hour is fine, but when they're waiting for a whole day to get to work, they're probably going to start burning things to get your attention.\n\nThe way you draw 'lines' in both the sense of a metro and in the sense of them being literal lines is a kinaesthetic pleasure. The visual and auditory senses combine to create a meditative yet active and engaging mood. Fantastic work on that sound, by the way. Very few games combine what's happening in the game with the sound the player hears that well. You can see from screenshots, too, the aesthetic appeal of the game. If you don't get some amount of pleasure just from looking at the game, then you might want to check whether or not you actually want to buy it.\n\nIn normal [which in some ways feels like 'survival', at the end of each week you get an upgrade to your system. These vary from map to map [In Cairo your trains only hold four passengers, in another of the maps you can get fast bullet trains] but you always get another train of some description which you can plop on an existing line or use as the basis of a new one. After accepting this, you get the choice between one of two additional upgrades, both of which you'll sorely need. Perhaps you need another two bridges to complete some loops, or another car to double the capacity of a train, maybe a fourth line so that you can make each more efficient. Whichever you choose, you may within moments regret your bad, stupid choice, because there's now a station on that one little island you've been looking at, wondering how soon you'll need more bridges to access. Now you have to redo a track or two to free up a bridge to make a line that reaches it. And a line it shall be, because although loops are generally more efficient, you just can't do it with that track if you want it to cover where you need it to cover.\n\nThus is the loop of the game. Meet demand. Watch demand rise. Panic. Meet demand.\n\nIf I must provide some outright negatives, I'll say that the game does what I might call a shoddy job at teaching you the basic controls. The tooltips telling you how to play only pop up once, so if you missed them, good luck. You can fiddle around a bit and make peace with losing a couple of games prematurely in order to work it all out, but some things it doesn't even seem to tell you [at least in enough detail you you'd understand it at first], like the fact you can click in the middle of a line between two stations and drag it to another station to add it to the link. A basic tool at your disposal, though not indespensible, the alternative way to perform the action is more time consuming, which gets in the way of the main appeal of this game, which is its creative flow.\n\nThat being said, all in all, this is a fantastic minimalist piece of logical art. The couple of issues I had learning the game at first were all resolved within the first hour, and I've had a great time since  then. It's fresh, and even after you understand it, the occasional curveball always keeps it interesting, as does the pursuit of perfection.\n\nNice to see a brilliant indie game from NZ.","February 29","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I SEE THE JOKE HERE."\n\nBrought the game on the strength of that joke alone. However, the game is strong enough on its own merits that I'm very pleased with my purchase. On endless, you've got a fantastic idle game you can fiddle with while listening to a podcast, trying to up your efficiency. On normal, you've got an intriguing puzzle that requires your constant attention, analysis and problem-solving skills [along with the occasional gamble] as you try and make sure that the people flow so as to not get left standing on a station to the point where their complaints get you shut down.\n\nAs a side note, I like to imagine that this represents the complete anarchy of people who're waiting on a station platform for too long. An hour is fine, but when they're waiting for a whole day to get to work, they're probably going to start burning things to get your attention.\n\nThe way you draw 'lines' in both the sense of a metro and in the sense of them being literal lines is a kinaesthetic pleasure. The visual and auditory senses combine to create a meditative yet active and engaging mood. Fantastic work on that sound, by the way. Very few games combine what's happening in the game with the sound the player hears that well. You can see from screenshots, too, the aesthetic appeal of the game. If you don't get some amount of pleasure just from looking at the game, then you might want to check whether or not you actually want to buy it.\n\nIn normal [which in some ways feels like 'survival', at the end of each week you get an upgrade to your system. These vary from map to map [In Cairo your trains only hold four passengers, in another of the maps you can get fast bullet trains] but you always get another train of some description which you can plop on an existing line or use as the basis of a new one. After accepting this, you get the choice between one of two additional upgrades, both of which you'll sorely need. Perhaps you need another two bridges to complete some loops, or another car to double the capacity of a train, maybe a fourth line so that you can make each more efficient. Whichever you choose, you may within moments regret your bad, stupid choice, because there's now a station on that one little island you've been looking at, wondering how soon you'll need more bridges to access. Now you have to redo a track or two to free up a bridge to make a line that reaches it. And a line it shall be, because although loops are generally more efficient, you just can't do it with that track if you want it to cover where you need it to cover.\n\nThus is the loop of the game. Meet demand. Watch demand rise. Panic. Meet demand.\n\nIf I must provide some outright negatives, I'll say that the game does what I might call a shoddy job at teaching you the basic controls. The tooltips telling you how to play only pop up once, so if you missed them, good luck. You can fiddle around a bit and make peace with losing a couple of games prematurely in order to work it all out, but some things it doesn't even seem to tell you [at least in enough detail you you'd understand it at first], like the fact you can click in the middle of a line between two stations and drag it to another station to add it to the link. A basic tool at your disposal, though not indespensible, the alternative way to perform the action is more time consuming, which gets in the way of the main appeal of this game, which is its creative flow.\n\nThat being said, all in all, this is a fantastic minimalist piece of logical art. The couple of issues I had learning the game at first were all resolved within the first hour, and I've had a great time since  then. It's fresh, and even after you understand it, the occasional curveball always keeps it interesting, as does the pursuit of perfection.\n\nNice to see a brilliant indie game from NZ.","February 29","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The visuals say it all, and convey it all, in a manner that is easy to comprehend instinctively before you purchase. But let me expand on that.\n\nThe design also conveys information INSIDE the game, not just the trailer. That's important. This type of minimalistic puzzler shouldn't sell you on simplicity and then be hard to understand. Mini Metro does what it promises so clean and so clear that you'll be surprised. It's graceful.\n\nIn essence, you are free to draw a selection of colored lines between designate points (stations) along a map. When lines are connected, they allow a train car to move automatically from station to station. At each station are a number of small shapes building in a queue. When the train stops at a station, it unloads any shapes (passengers) it is currently carrying provided they match the shape of the station, then grabs the passengers at the station and carries them along its line.\n\nThis plays automatically for a few turns until new stations appear. Then you need more lines.\n\nSoon you have too little carrying capacity and need more trains.\n\nAs you carry more and more people to their destination, you unlock upgrades that complicate the problem at hand without attaching complications to the mechanics. The additions are fluid. It keeps the experience tight and meditative, albeit a bit stressful because it's (mostly) in real time.\n\nAs you unlock new cities, the geography and use of tunnels/bridges come into play. Some levels have a faster train car, or a crazier population growth. Keep at it and you'll find yourself organically creating your own tricks: breaking down lines and moving them back and forth between overflowing stations over and over to create shorter paths for your trains, or pausing just so you can flip a train in the opposite rotation for one cycle. Every little decision can change your success.\n\nThis game works. It is fun.\n\nIf you've watched the trailer and read even a brief description you'll already know whether or not you like this type of experience. If you DO like it, then this will NOT disappoint you.","May 30","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Despite the simplicity of the mechanics, though, this is a brainbender extraordinaire; those of you who enjoy setting up systems to work in the most efficient manner possible will have an absolute blast here.\n\nThe concept is simple: you're in control of the subway system. Stations open across the map gradually, and you need to connect them with different coloured lines. Stations have different shapes, and the shapes of the "commuters" that appear at each station represent where they want to go. You will, then, need to plan out your routes so that there's minimal inefficiency; "circle" commuters will only ever want to go to "square" or "triangle" initially, for example, so there's little sense in making a line entirely out of circle stations.\n\nAs the game progresses, the map expands and the number of possible shapes for the stations increases, too, until eventually you're having to consider things like interchanges extremely carefully as well as just the routes for your lines, particularly if you're playing on the "Extreme" mode, where once you've laid a line down, you can't change it!\n\nThis is a highly enjoyable, inventive puzzle game, then, and particularly recommended to those who want something a little "gentler" than the big-budget fare of today!","November 7, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/licecolon/recommended/287980/","licecolon","Yan D","http://steamcommunity.com/id/licecolon/","139 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMini Metro is a puzzle game about stringing up as many different shaped stations in a line as possible. The challenge comes from the imbalance and numerousness of the spawned shapes, and your task is to figure out the logistics of shipping any cargo to its desired type of destination as efficiently as possible, without overflowing its spawn station, or any interchange stations on the way.\n\nThe art style will be familiar to anyone who uses their local metro system, however unfortunately this game is not a simulator by any means. If you want to build any metro line in a way that vaguely resembles reality, you will lose and you will lose hard. The screenshots you see are only representative of the first 5 minutes of the game, they are not representative of anything you might end up with - There will never be enough lines or trains supplied to allow you to create anything orderly - your trains will weave around the map, twisting and turning to gobble up all un-connected stations like a nokia snake.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who wants an interesting puzzle in a metro theme. However I have to downvote it because the description is misleading - If you're looking for a subway management simulator, look elsewhere.","July 24, 2015","false","1.3"," 45 of 89 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","45","89","0","0"

Great to play while listening to something. Each time you play you will get better at designing sound efficient systems. The leaderboards give incentive to improve yourself. I have only played this game as of this review for 5 hours and i can see myself playing it for a lot more.\n\nIt is very calm, and includes a night mode if you are not a fan of looking at a white screen the whole time. I can proudly say that for a few of the maps I am in the top 1000 best players, and I plan to do even better. Small decisions such as a new tunnel or line while small at firsst can mean a big difference.\n\nI saw this game after watching a youtube video of it by the youtuber Sips and decided to jump on it due to its simple puzzle and strategy elements.

Its catchy visual style attracts unreservedly and dedicated to people keen on minimalism and infographic style.\n\nEvery day more and more people from different reigns need to get to different places. You as a head of new subway station will construct new ways to help them reach thies destinations. The quantity of peole in sybways is increasing, so you'll need to enlarge your web of tunnels. City department will help you with you task, and  on the beginning of new week you'll gain a bonus. It could be an additional vagon to existing train. Or you can purchase extra tunnels for establish underwater ways. Maybe, you'll need a new line for decrease an overload on existing branches.\n\nSo far, only "survive" mode is available for now. How long will you support and reorganise your subway line before inevitable owerload (that leads to closure of all train branches) of human flow? I hope authors will make some new modes with obvious golas later.\n\nStill, Mini Metro is a simple (but not easy) and neat puzzle logic game with pleasant appearance that gives enjoyable pastime","October 30, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Passengers indiscriminate the destination station as long as it matches their shape.  Usually most stations are circle shaped, triangle and square stations are less and then there are these 3 or 4 uniquely-shaped (cross, pentagon etc.) stations that force you to interconnect all lines.\n\nAlso it's not a metro building game.  Underground tunnels with railways can be created instantly out of thin air and as easily removed should the need arise.  With time progress the stations appear randomly on the city map and this sometimes requires total rearrangement of the graphs.\n\nIt's an intriguing puzzle game that can be played for short durations.  Instant satisfaction, high replayability, nice colour palette, very smooth feeling from the animations.

This is a really fun game, one that will challenge your organizational skills while at the same time imparting a certain zen-like satisfaction when things work out the way you intended. Be aware that it is early access, so there is (as of the time I wrote this review) no audio and some tracks and some modes are not yet available. With that in mind, however, the game is very playable right now and the developers appear to be commited to making this better and better.","October 9, 2014","true","9.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Not more than it has to be nor less, it as close to perfect in the execution of this design concept as can probably be achieved. The only criticism I can level against the game is the randomness of the choices between days. Sometimes you just don't get any 'tunnel luck.' Also the music and sound are pleasant at first, but as the game runs long it can layer into an annoying dishormony of sounds.

You can read this post[devlog.dinopoloclub.com] by the developers of this game blog.\n\nThe game is really, really minimalistic, do not misunderstand me, I like also minimalistic games, but the first Steam tag is "Strategy", then "Simulation" tag. Here you will find no strategy and no simulation, just minimalism.\n\nAbout the gameplay, you have very few things to control, stations pop out in the game randomly, and above all even if disconnected from trails the people start to wait and going upset if they are unable to reach their kind of destination. You have no money budget to spend in something you think you need when you need it, there is no construction costs, but instead, every week you could get a new train or a new trail or a new vagon or an interchange improvement for a station, or finally a new tunnel/bridge. Naturally you can only get your week things budget if and only if your week score is high enough...\n\nThere is no construction or demolition time. Stations have no range, just people that need to reach their kind of destination. If you change stations with nodes and people with weight you could play with a subset of the math graph theory...LOL...\n\nAt the moment there is no editor.\n\nSo, finally if and only if, you are looking for a really minimalistic game, you could be satisfied, apart the price that is not such a minimalistic price, maybe best to wait for sales, otherwise this game is really too much minimalistic...\n\nSorry but, I have to not suggest this game to the public.","January 18","false","5.7"," 18 of 36 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","18","36","0","0"

Each level starts off easy, but quickly spirals out of control. The game tosses in new points and people for your network to accomodate, and though the growth rate of the network accelerates, your rate of aquiring assets does not. What's worse, is that I kept feeling like I just wanted it to pause for a minute so I could figure out if I was doing things right, but it grinds reletlessley forward withough giving you time to think.  I guess what I miss the most is a chance to learn and improve, but each round gets so out of hand that I don't have time to learn what I'm doing wrong. I suppose enough trial and error would get me there, but I like a game that gives me a ramp to climb instead of expecting me to fail my way through.\n\nIf you dig quick games, and you enjoy hectic game play, then this may be the game for you. It's easy to learn and hard to master, and the interface is nice on the eyes. The audio ties into the actions occuring on screen, which got old quick for me, but others seem to really dig it. There's multiple game modes, and many levels.\n\nAll in all, I suspect that this is a great game that I happen to have no taste for. Though others seem to love it, I don't think I'll be reccomending it to any of my friends.","May 4","false","1.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

I wasn't expecting too much, but was still disappointed by the lack of gameplay ;  you will be spending much more time looking at the game than interacting with it.  At a certain point it turns very suddenly from a laid back and easy game to an overwhelming and impossible race against the passengers, which may have been an intentional mechanic by the developer to end the game before the player notices that there's nothing more to do.  Unfortunately the endless play mode ruins this concept and makes it very obvious that there isn't much left to see. This game is very beautifully designed and has a relaxing soundtrack so it would have been a good purchase at a fraction of its price, but for $10 I was really expecting much more than I got.\n\nWhile this game looks appealing, don't buy it if you're expecting any more than an hour of entertainment.

I can’t recommend this because it really feels like nothing more than a web-browser game. It is still open beta and it is only like $6 but still I wouldn’t pay $6 for a flash game.\nAside from things clearly still in development like sound, more levels, a bunch of options and stuff like that, there’s just no meat to the game. Essentially all you’re doing is dragging lines between dots on the screen not unlike the zillion air traffic controller clones for mobiles. While I’m looking for casual as opposed to a transport simulator, it still needs more to feel like a game. How about currency, pricing, upgradables, a map that zooms out and enlarges as the game progresses, etc.?\nDon’t get me wrong, the game is fun and super addicting for like 5 or less hours. After that however, there’s just nothing else to do. If you can accept this and have a couple of dollars to burn, go for it. If you are neurotic and have to do simple repetitive tasks to maximize efficiency, play away. If you are looking some actual content or something more than your average free mobile game, I wouldn’t bother.\n","September 19, 2014","false","5.9"," 52 of 118 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","52","118","0","0"

Can't accomplish anything with strategy when you spend literally all your time fighting the horrible route interface and the arbitrary, random, nonsensical design decisions that make the game more of a time waster where success is based as much on luck as on skill. I read several strategy guides and managed to make headway in the game, eventually beating all the basic level goals, but it was never enjoyable in any way because the game is so fundamentally broken and badly designed. I prefer strategy games, not luck based time wasters. The game has no sound and I literally had more fun listening to my Solar Fields ambient trance albums in the background than I did playing the game.\n\nSome examples:\n\nMetro lines frequently refuse all attempts to revise their route for absolutely no reason unless you chop out the ENTIRE line and remake it. This is a huge headache and by itself makes the game unplayable when the randomness requires adaptation. I know you can click the route near a station and then drag over the station to remove that section of the route -- I'm saying that sometimes it simply doesn't work, and for no reason that I can discern. EDIT 6/19/2015 - This was fixed in the last patch\n\nNew stations spawn randomly (you cannot build stations) and often in places that make level goals inaccessible (e.g. "Carry 1000 passengers using only 1 tunnel" but then new stations keep spawning between 2 rivers and long before the map opens up to give you more route options). Or how about the Hong Kong level goal: Move 1100 passengers with only 8 stations per line. Sounds reasonable, until you recognize that stations often spawn INTO your routes and instantly ruin your entire game on the spot. Or Berlin where you must carry the same huge number of passengers using only 1 locomotive per line. What's that? You say the end of week choices didn't offer you another line to run your end of week locomotive on? Too bad. Hit restart, try again, maybe next time you'll get luckier.\n\nPassengers often accumulate at a station with multiple empty trains passing by regularly without picking them up for absolutely no reason (connecting lines properly placed to destination, sometimes destination was even on the same line!) and this is yet more hair pulling insanity because within 30 seconds or so of passengers not being picked up at a station it's BLAM GAME OVER because the game ends the instant people have to wait too long for a train pickup. Why? I have no idea. That's just what the developer chose. Several times I got Game Over despite clearing the passengers out of the station just before the timer ran out. I don't know why.\n\nThere seems to be no fundamental locational supply and demand for stations (it's all random) and only a tenuous connection between time of day and passenger movements, if there IS any connection. I get that the different geometry icons and the way they evolve independent of the player is designed to simulate a city economy moving and the metro having to adapt to changing demand but in practise the implementation is so scattered, crazy, and random that it makes no sense and is the antithesis of fun to have to deal with. Real world metrorail transport doesn't work this way. Combine this with all the other interface headaches and you'll likely be passionately hating the game before you get too far.\n\nThese fundamental problems make the game generally unplayable, unenjoyable, and outright annoying, and I could not possibly recommend this pile of disasterous development and unsound design. The fact that the game has no sound has no bearing on the final verdict. It's just bad.\n\n---------------\nUPDATE 6/19/2015\nI've played this game several more hours and beat all the maps since I wrote this review and I still feel essentially the same. A patch removed the problem with track route not changing but the more I play the more I realize that the main game mode (not endless or extreme) is based almost entirely on luck of the draw with you predestined to fail sooner or later. To get the goals and unlock the extreme modes you have to have some combination of lucky starting position, lucky station spawns, and lucky end week choices. Sure, you need good planning and careful manipulation of the routes on top of that as well, but do you really want to play a game that force fails you based on luck no matter how skilled you are? I don't. I still don't recommend this game unless you like wasting time. It's a decent time waster, but a bad strategy game.","June 17, 2015","false","27.4"," 4 of 22 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","4","22","0","1"

I know I haven't put much time in it, but that is because I got bored really quickly.\n\nThis game feels like a more boring version of "Pipe Dreams", which for the younger crowd is a game where you have to build a piping system before liquid would flow and points were rewarded for the length of pipe the water traveled through before flooding out of the pipes.\n\nI digress. This game is about setting up a "metro" system to pick up shapes and deliver them to a station of the same shape. While you are setting up your "tracks" new shapes randomly appear as well as patrons. Those shapes have to be integrated into your system before the patrons get frustrated and leave at which point you lose.\n\nThe bigger problem I have with this game is that there is no way of planning your system as the shape locations appear at random. There is a way to restructure your system but the interface feels unintuitive and I'm never sure if when I remove tracks/trams that they return to my inventory. From what I can tell - trams do not - and therefore you are punished for a restructure that you couldn't have planned before.\n\nThis game feels like a mobile game, best experienced on the crapper.\n\nI hesitate to say this game is horrible as it has many great reviews, but as a fan of casual games - you can skip this one. Sorry devs.\n\nI will give this game more time and if my opinion changes I will update this review.","March 26, 2015","false","0.5"," 10 of 36 people (28%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","28","10","36","0","0"

I know the game is supposed to mimic the look of a transit map, but the plain, flat, minimalistic shapes were really boring to look at.  Did not at all put me in mind of moving people from place to place.  These type of visuals might work much better on a mobile device than on a full PC display.\n\nI was frustrated that I could not choose the type of upgrade I needed at some points.  When I needed tunnels, it only offered me lines and locomotives.  When I needed lines, it only offered my tunnels and carriages.\n\nTrains seemed to drive by passengers for no good reason - train was not full, and destination stop was only one or two stations down the track.  This really affected playability negatively at higher levels.\n\nMaybe in a few more iterations this might be fun, but not yet...","August 17, 2014","false","0.5"," 23 of 90 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","23","90","0","1"

For a game thats still pretty young, it has very little issues. There is no sound, as of present, but I heard the company is working on that. It's a really good game.\n\n9/10  stars","January 12, 2015","true","56.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It´s a simple and entertaining game that you can just hop in and out of, but it can also get quite hectic in the endgame. The pricepoint isn´t too high and the levels are varied enough. And the game is in early access, so more is to come, i assume.

The concepts are simple and easy to grasp but the game quickly becomes increasing difficult, challenging the player to plan ahead or get crushed by the number of people trying to use the station. Just bought it and couldn't put it down for 4 hours. While this is in beta, it is perhaps one of the most complete and fun betas I've playing in a long time, and is really only missing audio (which is coming soon).  Can't say enough about the UI as well. Clean and crisp and easy to navigate. Definitely looks like a london underground system map.\n\nAt present build (beta 15) this game is an 8/10.

That's basically it.  You have a limited number of lines, a limited number trains and cars to place on your lines, and a limited number of tunnels to cross water, each of which you recieve more of as you play.  You can place and delete and rearrange your lines and trains as much as you want for no cost (and there is a tactical pause).  All you have to do is keep getting polygonal people to their polygonal destinations smoothly as long as you can, while the number of stations and passengers keeps increasing.\n\nAlthough the game is still in early access, this is really an incredibly polished game (the only thing missing is sound, which I don't mind).  It looks clean an modern and beautiful, it has a lovely UI and menu system... it's extremely clear and easy to use.  I've spent several hours playing it so far, and I definitely intend to play more... it is a great casual game - easy to pick up, with short self-contained sessions - but it also has some real depth.  You can put a lot of thought into your metro designs, or you can just throw something down and watch what happens.  It's quite flexible in terms of ways to play.  Each map/level/city also offers unique constraints and layouts (semi randomized each time of course), and the difficulty of the levels ranges from hold-my-hand to crushingly difficult, giving you access to all of them immediately, so you can explore your ability and comfort level from the beginning, and aspire to those harder cities.\n\nThe only negative thing I can think of to say about the game is that I wouldn't want to sit and play it for hours straight.  It's more of a pick-up put-down game.  Also, there is no tutorial, and while the UI is relatively straight forward, understanging the princples of the game might take you a couple minutes and/or google searches.  Hopefully a tutorial will be added soon :)\n\nHighly recommended!  I think this has a lot of appeal for a lot of different types of people.","January 4, 2015","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game at the moment has no audio. The aim of the game is to keep your transport system fluent. If stations are crowded the game will end. The game features in several different cities. At the end of the week you will get a locomotive and 2 tunnels/carriage or line. At the start its best to make sure the most common stops like(circle,triangle,square). This will prevent transferring passengers from one place to another. Holding passengers is a bad idea as it just makes the stations more crowded.

Especially trains. Most people say:\n"I can do a much better job at that!" Well, lets see if you can\n\nThis is a game where you control the London underground, exept it's not always in London. It could be Auckland, New York or even Paris! The developers - Dinosaur Polo - are always open for ideas, so if you don't like something (how?) it would be fixed.\n\nThe controls can be a bit dodgy, removing a station for example isn't as easy as it sounds. You get upgrades every\nSunday which allow you to:\n\nAdd a carriage (max 3)\nAdd a train ( max 3 I believe)\nIncrease the amount of tunnels/bridges\nAdd a line ( max 7, start with 3)\nand more!\n\nThe game comes with 2 modes, with one coming soon:\n\nCommuter\nScenic\nRush hour (to be added)\n\nCommuter is the normal, standard, frustrating game\nScenic, you can't lose.

Connect stations to your lines as they appear on the map and try to offer the best service possible to your passengers. If you do well you can earn more line colors, tunnels and additional wagons.

It's reassuring.  Almost boring.  A little voice in the back of my head tells me that I'm laying foundations for what will come next, and that it's important to get this right, but the ease of redesigning my entire system at this point in the game tells me that the voice is lying.  The week ends, I get a new locomotive, and choose one of options to go with it.\n\nSomehow, by week five, my nice, neat train system has started to turn into a spider's-web of cross-connections and long loops.  I need to add a new station to the main loop, which means disconnecting three stations, then reconnecting them in a different sequence.  Of course, now that I've done that, it should reduce the pressure on that line and mean that I'm dropping passengers off more often, which should improve the overall capacity.  Unfortunately, I didn't notice a new station opening up on the other side of the map, and it's critically overcrowded.  Game over.\n\nMini Metro is a roguelike action-puzzle game where the central mechanic is designing a train network.  It's trickier than it looks, and if it gets its strangely compelling hooks into you, it may drive you insane.  Enough time wasted - I need to fire it back up and see if I can work out a better way of dealing with those annoying suburban regions where nobody wants to get off, and everybody wants to get on....","October 12, 2014","true","73.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Another bloody circle station appears...\nMini Metro is where you're in charge or a city's transportation. People need to get going. You're the one in charge. You can't screw up. Mini Metro is where things can escalate within a matter of minutes. You'll have about 3 lines connecting to 5 or so stations and then you'll have some strange trickery of loops and squiggles of so-called train lines.\n\nThere are the ocassional bugs that appear rarely, but notable. When you have a train with more than 8 carriages *i know...*, it can teleport when you've redrawn a line that completely exposes it's temporary line. So basically, when you redraw the track so much so that your train is off the newly drawn track, the train will teleport to the nearest station that the newly drawn line is connected to.\n\nNow, of course, this is in Early Access. So, I'm telling you right now, get the game. For $7, it's worth every cent. 10/10, would buy again.","October 13, 2014","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes damn near anything.\n\nas usual the TL:DR is here but more in depth below\n\n*FUN AND EASY TO PLAY CASUALY\n*NICE MINIMALISTIC ART DESIGN AND GAMEPLAY\n*MODERATELY DIFFICULT WITH A NICE LEARNING CURVE\n\nThis game is however a nice little puzzle game with a very recognisable art style and play style. The plain and simple idea being build a rail system by dragging lines to appearing stations. The stations start of very few and far between and are represented by different shapes and above each station appear smaller black shapes. Those are your passengers the shape of them show where they want to get to, Simple yes? .. no. This is where the games "puzzle" element comes to play. Each person wants to get to specefic stations and you want to get them there so you join up stations with lines and make a lovely little picture, however more stations will gradually appear on the map  meaning you have to add more in to your netweork or the current stations will change shape meaning more traffic or congestion etc.\nFor all of this against you, you do have help after each "week" of surviving you get more trains,tunnels, carriages etc to help you. For what it is worth this game can be a little time sink making you want to beat your times and climb the leaderboards.\nFor how fun it is though it just screams IOS to me, with the dragging of lines the simplicity of it all. there isnt much to say about this game. If you love puzzles games with a good amount of replayability and the art style strikes you as nice then i would suggest this game as it can most certainly take up a few afternoons.","October 14, 2014","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You'll want to try to beat your score and get more efficient and connecting your stations.

I love the dark themed version of the game in the options.

Especially trains. Most people say:\n"I can do a much better job at that!" Well, lets see if you can\n\nThis is a game where you control the London underground, exept it's not always in London. It could be Auckland, New York or even Paris! The developers - Dinosaur Polo - are always open for ideas, so if you don't like something (how?) it would be fixed.\n\nThe controls can be a bit dodgy, removing a station for example isn't as easy as it sounds. You get upgrades every\nSunday which allow you to:\n\nAdd a carriage (max 3)\nAdd a train ( max 3 I believe)\nIncrease the amount of tunnels/bridges\nAdd a line ( max 7, start with 3)\nand more!\n\nThe game comes with 2 modes, with one coming soon:\n\nCommuter\nScenic\nRush hour (to be added)\n\nCommuter is the normal, standard, frustrating game\nScenic, you can't lose. You get points by how many passengers use your metro per week\nRush hour will probably be a ery intense commuter mode\n\nIn the game we have four types of stations:\n\nCircle (common)\nTriangle (uncommon)\nSquare (rare)\nSpecial (very rare)\n\nEven though some are rarer then others, you will get at least one of these each game. The map is randomly generated however, so you never know where they will spawn.\n\nThat should finish my review.

Gorgeous, minimal and uncluttered design, lovely bright colours and simple shapes are the order of the day. Shaped stations pop up on the white landscape, requiring you to join them together with lines. As you do, passengers appear at them, demanding to get to other stations.\n\nThe system that deals with moving passengers about, especially when to and when not to pick them up and which interchanges to drop them at seems, even in this 'early access' build, to be flawless.

Having played only an hour and a half at the moment I can see myself loosing much more time to this game.\n\nWhile the lack of music is sad, being Early Access, I can't wait for the soundtrack to be added on.\n\nAll in all, this is no train sim, it is a frustratingly fun strategists dream which challenges your abilities each time you play through and there is no forgiveness for even the slightest oversight. That being said, I would have liked a little tutorial that would have explained that when a new station appears on an existing line it becomes a place where trains blissfully roll by. Therefore, you must either redraw the entire line to include the new station or add it to another line.\n\nGraphically, the simplistic design is really quite beautiful and as time goes on you start to admire the mess of lines that begin to splay out as you try to balance length of lines and coverage.\n\nAll in all, a great game and I highly recommend picking this game up while it is at a very reasonable price.\n\nOn a lighter note, I now take my hat off to every Transport Minister past and present.","August 13, 2014","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If, however, you're looking for a mass transit sim ... this is not it.\n\nOnce you figure out key elements of maximizing efficiency, you begin to realize that the real-world logic behind the layout of the world's metros need not apply. Thinking of a radial design enclosed by a circle line? It'll only last if the sequence of shapes makes sense. Ultimately that's where the game lost its 'sim' appeal for me.\n\nNevertheless it's a satisfying puzzler that can embrace many different tactical approaches.","August 27, 2014","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although it soon becomes apparent that the task is huge. Each new station that appears, is another problem you have to deal with. You have to manage your resources well to keep your line open. At the end of each round you recieve bonuses like a new train, an additional line or carriage. You decide which, choose wisely or you may just be making your own downfall.\nYou don't need to be a seasoned gamer to get to grasps with this amazing game. Although it's in Early Access, you can see how the game will shape and find new ways to captivate you. The recent addition of Zen Mode keeps you expanding your line for the ultimate Metro.\nWhat I love most about this game is that you can not win, only survive the hustle and bustle of the stations for as long as your, hopefully, well planned lines will allow it. The game is aesthetically pleasing - They use the classic coloured lines; like you would see on a metro map. You watch your map expand in realtime as you add more to it.\nHow long can you survive?","August 29, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hours of fun and many pleasurable challenges.","October 2, 2014","true","89.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then I noticed I have clocked over 100 hours in the two weeks that I have had this game. It is sucking my soul the way a game hasn't done since I was too young to have anything better to do than play games anyways. Now, admittedly, a portion of those hours are from me passing out with the game open, contemplating the overall efficiency of my entire subway system having been thrown a curve-ball station or two. But the difference between 100 hours total and 80 hours conscious is really not that significant, relative to overwhelming number of 0.6hrs-played games in my library. I don't normally write reviews, but I know there are casual gamers out there with similar disappointments, so this review is for you.\n\ntl:dr : Casual, strategic gamers that like to watch their decisions unfold in as perfect a manner as they can conclude, get this game! Even (especially) in Early Access!\n\nReview:\nI forgot this game was Early Access until I came to this page to write the review, and that's a good thing! Most of us have been victimized by vaporware, and I understand your hesitation to trust it (or really anything on steam anymore), such that our reviews are the only information worth sifting through anymore.\n\nMini Metro is a minimalist game both visually and in its core mechanics. That being said, it does both of these things so well and uniquely, even and its current state, that it seems more polished than a large portion of the released titles that just keep pumping out. And, although I yearn for more maps (when are we ever truly satisfied), the game feels complete enough that if it went full release today, I would clock another 100 hourse easily. The only thing it's missing is sound, but that's on the list to be added and ultimately the silence doesn't really detract from the game, playing my own moodscapes in the background. I'm sure there's more content that they plan to add, but I haven't been following the devs enough to tell you what those are. And honestly, bilissfully ignorant of their promises, I can tell that any new content is just going to be a wonderful surprise as the game progresses out of Early Access, such as the newly added Rush Hour Mode (more on that later). Also what I can't tell you is how fast the game is being updated. I got this game only recently, and in that time they updated with the addition of a whole new mode, but I may have just lucked out on my timing - look to other reviews or follow the devs for this info.\n\nAt its heart, Mini Metro is a game where you create a subway (or metro depending on your colloquialism) system that is as efficient as possible at delivering passengers between stations.\n\nI had gotten 1/4 the way into my original review, which was on the way to being pretty fleshed out I thought, but then I learned there is a charlimit when writing reviews. So, it's sorta lost it's cohesion but I hope I got most of my love for this game out.\n\nStations are also abstract and minmalistic, being represented by bordered geometric shapes. All maps start you with a Circle, Square, and Triangle station, and represent the most common stations you'll see. Having no depth of explanation, it's difficult to call those stations by anything other than their shapes, only learning to conceptualize the different types as things like transfers and major stations once you learn how the stations need to be connected to be efficient later in the game. That being said, you often have to use stations as a matter of efficiency that betrays your concepts of them. This is one of the things I find special about Mini Metro. You can know the rules in and out, but your understanding of their roles changes with every new station that pops up, creating a logic of efficiency that is more conscious and fulfilling than simply figuring out the math.\n\nThere is no right or wrong decision (except for Rush Hour mode) as everything you've done on the map so far can be freely and meticulously readjusted instantaneously. The few resources the game limits you with like the number of trains and bridges, when not in use, are returned to your pool of resources with zero loss; you can only get more, and will need more. Even lategame when you're struggling to keep 20-30 stations efficient as a whole, a few clicks and you can wipe the board of your entire subway for a fresh start, but without a restart back to silly ol' 3 stations. Casual, no need to dredge through a game you just played a second time to get to a point where you can use what you learned the first time, you can just continually build on your knowledge.\n\nIt's actually those lategame board clears that, personally, are the most fun for me. As you progress on a map, you'll get extra trains. I only ever use one train on a line. This is extremely limiting, but I enjoy the challenge of the game that way, because without a second train to pick up the slack, lines have to be more efficient at interacting with eachother, dropping off passengers in perfect spots, running cross-track or parallel to alleviate congestion, balancing short but heavily loaded lines with long but easily resolved ones. And a board clear of infrastructure allows me to consider an efficient system as a whole instead of one in relation to what I had built already. This is normally where I pass out staring at my screen.\n\nGame Modes, since I'm not sure I've seen a review for since Rush Hour came out:\nThe game has three modes currently, Commuter (skirmish), Scenic (peaceful), and  new Rush Hour (permabuild).\nThe difference between Commuter mode and Scenic mode is mosty just that if you aren't being efficient enough on a Commuter map, your passengers pile up and get mad that they're stting in a station too long, you'll fail.\n\nRush Hour is the bane of my existence. Most of what I have described is in the two modes where you can readjust your lines and resources. In Rush Hour mode, once you connect two stations, you can't unconnect them. You can extend their lines to new stations, but then you're stuck with that order of stations. Trains move down the line from one station to another, and then turn around and do the opposite order (unless you loop them). Because of this, in any game mode, adding a new station to the line affects its overall efficiency by first simply making the people at one end of the line wait longer for the train to get back, secondly because if passengers aren't getting dropped off efficiently, your train gets full and he passes by stations of people already waiting. Even extra trains, when placed, can't be picked back up. The only saving grace to this mode is that while in the other modes, stations just simply appear and you have to deal with them accordingly. In Rush Hour mode, you get to see where and what type the next station will be. I have not spent more than a few minutes in this mode as it requires a completely different mindset than the way I play the other two modes.\n\nFor $7 at regularly priced Early Access, probably the most appropriately priced item I've bought on Steam.\n\n10/10 Would connect the dots for 100 more hours with even the smallest of a content boost.","January 27, 2015","true","166.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dotancient/recommended/287980/","dotancient","Bebop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dotancient/","179 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst and foremost, Mini Metro is one of the most minimalistic games I have ever played. Everything from the design of the menus to the actual gameplay itself is super minimalistic, which makes the game easy on the eyes and overall a relaxing experience.\n\nThe game comes with 3 modes, Communter, Scenic, and Rush Hour, each with their own spin on the theme of delivering "passengers" to the station they would like to go to. But here is the catch, these "passengers" have a destination designated by a shape. That means if you have a circle passenger, and there are 3 circle stations on the map, then that passenger has 3 possible destinations. The system will obviously take the passenger on the route that is fastest to a circle station, but that makes the game not a "one passenger-one destination" sim, but rather a route building puzzle game.\n\nI highly recommend this for its relaxing gameplay, and would definitely recommend the game to my friends looking for a fun little casual game to burn some time on. However, if you are looking for a more hardcore simulation style transportation style game, this might not fit your expectations, but you will definitely still have fun!\n\nGood luck and game on!","February 18, 2015","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At present, there is no music and are no win conditions, but if you put on your own music it can be such a cozy atmosphere, and the lack of win condition, similar to tetris (it just gets harder and harder until you lose), provides a really addictive need to create an even better system.\n\nSimple to play, difficult to master, impossible to put down.

Simple but addicting mechanics. You control a city's metro system, you build different lines by connecting the "stops" which show up on the map. Each stop is shape-coded, and passangers want to go to specific shapes. I like to think of this as a kind of zoning metaphor, circles are residental, squares are malls, etc. But that's all secondary to the gameplay. Passengers are simply randomly generated at different stops, and your trains show up to take them where they want to go (hopefully). The map starts off very simple, and slowly expands and new stops are randomly generated. Every week you get a new train, and a semi-random perk. And that's it. At this stage there is a lot of room to build different modes that are more differentiated from one another, but as it stands a game that is very fun to play for easy quick gaming sessions.","November 17, 2014","true","56.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Commuter and Scenic are great arcade modes but a mode where there are certain goals to add some finality to the level instead of just 'keep going until you're gone' would help.\n- Some achievements - while relatively superfluous, they add some goals to the game, and that's what you're lacking right now.\n- Have the shapes show up in a certain pattern, while I liked the game, I had to admit it was a bit disheartening seeing a lot of circles, squares and triangles all around each other and one or other pentagon, cross or drop away from everything.\n- Maybe some in-game currency. Instead of depending on weeks (or milestones) maybe we can have some amount of cash spent by every person that enters the station and we use that money for extending (or removing) the lines, buying more locomotives, carriages, building tunnels.\n- Maybe have some other obstacles such as woods or mountains?\n\nThis game has a great potential and while I like it already it could be so much more awesome.","November 20, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As this is early access I will be talking more aboult the con's than the pro's to help the curators along.\n\ncons:\n1 why doesn't it open in full screen in the first place. pretty much every body i know would put this in full screen, it is just more sensible.\n\n2 it didnt seem to auto adjust to the res this was annoying until i found you could change the res and fine tune it.\n\n3 the bar at the bottom was not obvious in daytime mode, and would be better if the handle was a different colour. Also i feel it should start locked so that new players can find it easily (like me)\n\n4 there aren't adjustable intensities. slowing down the rate at which "people" spawn would be nice for when you're tired and don't want to play on a full out fps and dont want the full stress of what it is now. options like "slow" "casual" "normal" "hard" "intense" would be great. if there are these they are not obvious.\n\n5 night time is WAAAAYYYYY better than day time and this option should be easier to find.\n\n6 changing line shapes can be annoying sometimes i had to completley undo a line to fit in just 1 more station. to be able to break the line at any station would be great\n\nThat is all the cons I can think of so just remember that I focused on the cons. The gameplay is awesome even if it is very simple and is very addicting. It loads quickly which is awesome. it is nice and bright. it is simple enough to play when tired. and just get it. you will be addicted. AND ITS CHEAP AS CHIPS.

Yes you'll earn extra trains, extra carriages and extra lines.  But the whole game still comes down to the simple goal of linking your stations together.   You start with three stations and it seems an overly easy task but as the station start to increase so too does the difficulty and you find your metro system falling apart as you try to figure out the best way to connect them all.\n\nThankfully there's the option to hit Pause, then delete all your lines and have a wee think about a new tactic, before finding that it works even worse than your previous layout.  Lots of different maps to play on too to give a bit of variety.\n\nAs it's Early Access there are some things missing, no sound for example.  But the game idea is there and works perfectly and it can already keep you coming back over and over in it's current state.

Even though it resides in the early access areas of Steam, it can comfortably sit beside others that are deemed to be finished. The only thing missing from this game is sound. That being said, the sound is something I couldn't care less about. It is the least of my concern as I continue to further the efficiency and optimal layout of my subway lines.\n\nThe game itself is played through various stages, in this case, cities of the world. Each stage provides you with a basic layout map and routes or "lines" to place between stations. The stations are represented as shapes on the map that you must connect using your lines. As you do so additional symbols are shown on the map to represent the passengers.   Your locomotives move around the map autonomously along your set routes picking up and dropping off passengers as they go. This would present itself as an easy puzzle to solve, however, as the days and weeks go by in game, that couldn't be farther from the truth. It becomes a complex balancing act to try to get passengers to and fro as quickly as possible without allowing them to build up at an individual stations. This, as far as I can tell, is the only end game state. If a station has too many passengers, the countdown begins until finally the game notifies you of your defeat.\n\nThe game is so simple and elegant, yet complex and harsh, all at the same time. I haven't played anything like it before. It sits by itself in a world of indie games that are increasinging in quality all the time, yet somehow all have a familiar feeling. This eschews that familiarity for something altogether different. Something playable, satisfying, and ultimately, something worth spending your hard earned money on to enjoy fully.\n\nIf you aren't sure that you would in fact enjoy it, I recommend you go online and type in Mini Metro in your search engine of choice. There you will find a link to the developers "alpha" version of the game. It is very bare bones compared to what we have here, but it will no doubt allow you to get a taste of things for yourself. I don't think you'll be disappointed.\n\nHighly recommended!  10/10","October 29, 2014","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But really it is, amazing. The simplistic and minimalistic 2D artstyle is really nice. The way the game works is overwhelmingly good to be in an Early Access stage. The first few ingame days are quite simple while the further on you get in the game the harder it gets, more clutter with more stations, lines and locomotives. The stress gets real in this game.\n\nReally good game. If you haven't already bought the game I recomend you do so now.","October 29, 2014","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fun to expand and dynamically create stategies to make your metro lines more efficient, The game needs no explanation as it's pretty self-explanitory, shapes want to go to that station and the train will take them there. The art-style and design is very clean and polished, the menu is pleasing in the same manner.\n\nThe only thing I can suggest for the future versions of this game is a map generator and creator, the game does feel small in the sense that only a few select cities are available. A ledgend to show what lines have what locomotives and cars would help organize things when the map populates with more stations.","October 29, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mini Metro is so simple that instructions aren't necessary; just click and drag. Simple enough, right? Well, wait until you have to choose between another rail line or a carriage. Wait until you run out of tunnels and cannot cross bodies of water. Wait until your stations start overflowing. Each round brings its own unique challenges, and it is very fulfilling to complete them. The art in Mini Metro is simple, yet it works perfectly with the game (and would now seem strange if it were presented any other way). I am excited to see future versions with music and more maps.","October 31, 2014","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
