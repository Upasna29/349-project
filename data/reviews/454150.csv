The sights for the guns aren't accurate and the sight for the M4 is a block and you can't see where you aiming. Changing the settings in game ruins it but it eventually fixes. As of right now there is 3 guns and 3 maps, and both teams have the same player model. The guns are bad the sounds are stolen from Counter Strike and when you get close to a player the guns are just images.","April 22","false","0.3"," 35 of 54 people (65%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","65","35","54","6","0"

As most SНIT early access games released last 4 years, this game has potential. Let's see, how it will be  abandoned  finished off in some moths.\nDon't really recommend to buy this game for now. Game is empty, tickrate is low, and there's a lot of cheaters. For now. Will see, what happens in time.\nHope devs won't take cash and disappear, like Bohemia Interactive with DayZ.","April 26","true","1.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","9","14","5","0"

There are only three Arenas and much of the options or other things are missing. But what is there is not to bad. The stages (maybe from the Unitystore) are small but nice. Handling is ok. The main problem right now, is that there are too less players in the game, the most of the time, i was alone (EDIT: since my review, i go back from time to time and check, if there are players. i found everytime i few. so you can play with others). So, it is hard to recommend. But, it is only a buck…and maybe you have some friends...\n\nThis video shows all the things, that are in the game right now. At the end, another player entered the server. Thanks to him, i was not alone for a few minutes.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rT7h-OabGDg","April 19","true","0.6"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","18","35","3","0"

Also while playing the game equipped with the best features audio graphics will affect you. It's almost one of the world's most-played games, Minecraft, has become as a FPS game again. Warbit game, you are given more than one using the best equipment you will encounter on the map where you are shooting all enemies you have to disappear. These functions take forever but in the end you will be accomplished. As game makers and other players logged in to their room by setting up your own your room, we offer you to fight. It's up to you to choose. Build your own room, want to fight against other players, or in rooms that have been established by logging into the war. Fighting experience will increase and will become even more powerful in this style fps game. https://youtu.be/Xv4gAPnLmj8","April 20","true","0.2"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","10","20","2","0"
