And make an acutal review about it with that. Obviously these points are my opinion, so don't judge it.\n\nPre-Sequel Pros:\n\n- Classes are more interesting\n- Cyro is probably better than Slag (in game design)\n- Cars are faster\n- Early game is more fun\n- Vault hunters actually say things to the story\n- Butt Slams\n\n\nBorderlands 2 Pros:\n\n- Longer story\n- Better DLCs\n- Not as much walking\n- More guns\n- Maps are more colorful\n- Better characters and humor\n- No annoying oxygen mechanic\n- More types of enemies\n- More Bosses/post story content\n- Better side quests\n- Less expensive\n\n\nSo, overall I'd say BL2 is better. If you already played BL1 and BL2, buy TPS if you liked them. Even though you might wanna wait for a discount.\nAs for people who are new to the series, I'd play BL1 or BL2 first, since this one is more expensive, and probably the worst one of the three.","November 13, 2015","true","38.7"," 407 of 444 people (92%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","92","407","444","29","10"

They were right at one point, but the game has taken a turn for the better\n\nIf you haven't played Borderlands 2 yet, I highly recommend at least playing through the main story of that game before picking up this one.\n\nThe game takes place on Pandora's moon, Elpis, and just like the games before it, you take control of one of four Vault Hunters, and you shoot your way through waves of bandits, psychos, hostile wildlife and an entire military force to open a vault. However, this game does have many different features to it that make it unique, and a lot of returning features.\n\nPros;\n+Lazer weapons. A very welcome tool for your arsenal. They range from rapid fire assault rifles to shotguns to railguns\n+Cryo weapons. I wanted these very badly in 2, and my wish got granted. They restrict affected enemies movements and makes them vulnerable to melee attacks (mind that it does the same to you)\n+Vending Machines are now somewhat relevant. In 1 and 2 I didn't even bother looking in gun vending machines, but now that you're able to buy purple and orange rarety weapons, they actually have a purpose now\n+Manuverability. This is what really defines this game out of the series. The low gravity on Elpis allows acrobatic gunfights and more importantly; butt slams (or ground pounds. But butt slam is more fun)\n+Grinder. You can grind lower rarety weapons into better weapons of a higher rarety. Not an 100% chance of a higher rarety, but its a good way to get rid of some of your white and green guns\n+Classes. Skill trees are the same setup (I mean that as a good thing), and the classes are very unique... hopefully they'll have enough ideas for three\n\nCons;\n-Side Quests. While the main quest's dialouge is interesting, and the gameplay is great, most side quests are just flat out dull in speech and gameplay. Too many fetch missions, that lead to more fech missions. Granted some do reveal how things came to be in time for 2, and others are funny enough to be redeemed, most aren't worth the EXP.\n-Lazy Raid Boss. Bosses now respawn (that was an issue for a while), but the first and only raid boss of the base game is the final boss with more health and higher damage output. While I still did enjoy murdering it, I would much rather prefer something new and fresh.\n-Shorter than 2. It has 13-14 chapters versus the 18 chapters 2 had.\n-Terrain. The game has many cool areas, with multiple ways to kill you. The only problem is, falling to your death is a little too easy at times. The manuverability I talked about before helps this, unless you're in a vehicle.\n\nNeutral things\n*Oxygen. When in a vacuum, you must rely on your oxygen supply to live (surprising right). Oxygen also allows you to double jump and butt slam, so be sure to keep an eye on it.\n*Many returning weapons. A lot of weapons are similar to 2, so it should be a somewhat familiar experience with the loot.\n*Moonstones. The new Eridium. Used for ammo upgrades, moonstone chests (spend them to get purple rarety weapons/gear) or that lame raid boss I was talking about earlier. So mostly ammo.\n\nIf you loved 2, you'll love this game. I love this game, so it pains me to say this; buy it on sale. Sure the gameplay is great, but the quests seem tedious and lack luster, and while the Claptastic Voyage DLC redeems this, a game shouldn't rely on DLC to fix itself.\n\n\n(This is my first review, so please give me some feedback on how I could improve my writing, or any spelling or gammatical errors.)","April 16, 2015","true","91.7"," 212 of 230 people (92%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","92","212","230","12","6"

More thanks to those who left comments.\n\n\nI don't want to write lengthy reviews since they take a lot of time; time that could be spent on playing my backlog of games.\n\nI love Borderlands.  I want to continue loving it.  The Pre-Sequel (TPS) is the 3rd game, and I have expectations.  At $60 I would expect more creativity, more risks, further embrace what BDL2 did successfully and remedy the areas that needed correction. What TPS offered, however, seemed to be a mediocre effort on the fronts that mattered that warranted a detailed review.\n\n\nTPS does do some things right:\n\nClasses: Although it still follows the archetypes of assault, offense, support and general purpose, there is enough variation and changes to make the classes feel different.  For instance, meleeing in BDL2 was very unsafe; Zer0's Deception covered too many areas to make melee effective (Slag, movement speed, dashing attack, damage output and more.) TPS introduced a much more flexible melee style through Athena, where she could close in distance very quickly, dashing across the area and capable of surviving through firefights.  TPS also expanded the use of stacks in all characters and eliminated overpowered damage increases from the likes of the Gunzerker.\n\nMoney and Vending Machines are relevant: In BDL2, money was useless on any mode.  Vendors continued to sell white items even at OP8.  I rarely saw Purples and Legendaries never appeared.\n\nTPS vendors have Purples and Legendaries much more often, so money does play a role to help you gear up, and you'll want to treat death seriously to prevent being unable to afford said items.\n\nMoonstones: The eridium equivalent and this resource is constantly used. Players will be using it on multiple things, such as the Grinder to enhance the chance of improving the rarity of the weapon generated and adding an additional effect on the final product.\n\nGrinder: All weapon have a use. You can recycle unwanted weapons in hopes to get something new. Given that the vendors have better gear often, there's a bit of resource juggling where there's a choice to sell the item or craft a new one.\n\nSlamming: A crouching mechanic, for all classes, used in midair to drop quickly to the ground to create an AoE slamming strike.  This opens up new combat tactics and variations.  It should be a new staple.\n\nLasers: A very welcome addition to the player's arsenal. All barrels function differently (with varying strengths and weaknesses,) and combining with the weapon brand gimmicks, lasers are the most varied weapon in the game. Different brands could enhance the strength AND negate the weaknesses.\n\n\nThe rest of the game is where it starts falling apart:\n\nWriting: I wasn't impressed with the writing. Censoring profanity is fine to a degree, given that profanity shouldn't be the dictating factor to provide humour. But when you replace the profanity with words that don't even seem to match the harshness, the potential seriousness of the Borderlands world, it sounds weak.   Many characters seem to lack impact due to the limited influence they play throughout the story, and when a lot of the humour from the predecessors is also ripped out, the game fails to make a good lasting impression.  More often than not, I found myself being bored of the tales I was presented because the game couldn't make me care.\n\nTerrains: Lots of death pits.  Auto-save beacons were rare.  It's almost designed to ensure players died often.\n\nSide Quests/Main Quests/Padding: There are game designs that are generally despised; RPGs fail to make Charisma have impact; obscene amounts of QTE's that add nothing to spark interest; poor autosave location etcs.  There are also bad quest designs.  TPS embraced one of the least liked quest designs and amplified the worst aspects of it.\n\nTPS adores Fetch Quests, but it's done in a way that quickly loses its welcome.  You have a fetch quest that midway branches to another fetch quest, then this branch opens up to another series of fetch quests.  The objectives have objectives within the objectives to reach the objective!  Multiple fetch quests in the span of only ONE quest, effectively doubling to tripling this dull experience.  Rinse and repeat multiple times in multiple quests.  The experience becomes infuriating when you add in the poor terrain, killing legions of enemies that drop no good loot to show for your efforts under agitation, painfully dragging yourself through this boredom all in hopes of there may be something better later on.\n\nThis is padding in the worst way -forcibly lengthening a game with minimal effort and creativity.  The game acts like it hates and mocks your free time.\n\nLack of Creativity: For a $60 game, I expected that 2K Australia (2KA) came up with more content with BDL2 as a foundation. Hyperion could have their own Assault Rifles again.   Atlas could have hid a stash of guns to preserve their brand.  How about a new gimmick in existing brands? Instead, 2KA did little, if anything, to the existing BDL2 weapon pool, thus all weapons felt exactly what I expected without additional testing.\n\nTPS uses 90% (estimation only) of BDL2's legendaries, creating very few originals for a new experience.  No praise should come from this lack of effort.\n\nDLCs: DLC business practices are judged very unfavorably when the game is threadbare. It puts me at a moral standpoint where I am morally unable to want to buy the DLCs when more work needed to be focused on the main game. DLCs are welcome additions when the main game has substance, but in TPS's case, these DLCs may serve as the surgery needed to revive it. So why not put more energy in the main product? Why must I feel cheated of a better experience?\n\n\nAnd the very worst:\n\nBosses are now Respawnable: For 161 days until March 24th 2015, bosses didn't respawn.  Players had to "ALT+F4" their game to prevent saving or duplicate their save files to fight minibosses.  Despite that this is remedied, that does not excuse the incompetence of 2KA for removing the said feature of to begin with.\n\n161 days.\n\n2KA knowingly took out a crucial feature that effectively killed the game's longevity.  2KA doesn't understand Borderlands.  The spirit of the franchise is noticeably absent.  2KA deliberately made a choice to make the game less fun for players, making the already hollow game offer even less.  Why?  Who approved of such a thing?\n\nRaid Boss:  The raid boss is the final story boss that has more health and deals more damage.\nAt best, the raid boss is a lazily slapped together effort that lacks any innovation and originality.  At worst, it's open contempt to the fans who had any expectations.\n\nThis is 2KA's way of saying that the players, who paid them $60 for this game, aren't worth their time to create a brand new boss fight.  2KA is giving no respects to the players who love the franchise, as if poorly reusing an existing boss meets the requirements of having a new boss, arrogantly attempting to justify that this mediocre amount of effort is suffice.\n\nThis is taking incompetence to a whole new level.  2KA has taken a new step on to directly insult players.  It took out the middle man that is the gameplay and questing, and found a way to get players to feel shocked, appalled and disappointed just by looking at the boss.\n\n\nFinal Verdict: 5/10 at the very best.\n\n2KA has offered us a game that meets the minimum expectations that fans have come to expect from a Borderlands game. This plays like a $30 DLC that costs $60. I cannot justify the $60 value with the experience TPS provided.  I do not pay money to feel insulted.  I do not reward such contempt and incompetence.\n\nIf you must give TPS a try, buy it on a steep sale.","November 21, 2014","false","255.5"," 2,005 of 2,527 people (79%) found this review helpful 77 people found this review funny","79","005","2","77","175"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Baker/recommended/261640/","The_Baker","The Baker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Baker/","111 products in account","(Updated review. Went from about 9 hours gameplay when I first wrote this to 30),\n\nWell I guess I'm just not having the same experience as most of the top commenters. So far I've really enjoyed the game.\n\nDoes it feel like it is a huge DLC? Yes. The menus are the same thing, the main screen when you start the game is the same thing (Your character, Claptrap doing stupid stuff in the background, same layout exactly just a different setting).\n\nDoes driving suck? Sorta. I've had issues with not making jumps and I've had times where occassionally my car decides to keep going straight while I'm turning. Yes I've fallen off the map multiple times, but it hasn't been that bad. Just something to get used to. I think the issue is more so that the jumps you have to do to get to other parts of the maps are very exact. There's not a lot of room to undershoot even with a perfect take off.\n\nIs AI bad? Not really. I feel like it's about the same as BL2, which wasn't perfect, but was pretty decent. If you see a guy and he doesn't see you he tends to walk around aimleslly. If you shoot they notice you 98% of the time, and when they don't, I just kill them and keep moving. No sense in standing around looking for reasons to not like the game.\n\nSo now I'll move onto things that I've noticed:\nIn BL2 you could find any weapon at any time. Not so here. Want a shotgun or a sniper rifle early?  Do some side quests then. You won't find them randomly. Want to play with the new ice weapons? Too bad, they don't start showing up for a long time. The loot system is definitely less randomized in this game. I got an Anshin Oz Kit from a side quest from Janie at level 3 and it's still the only one I've seen by Anshin and I've gotten two characters to level 12. I've seen Orange level rarity weapons and items a bunch from vendors but I've had white level equivelants that were better from a lower level. Also selling and buying prices are DRASTICALLY different in this game. Buying the Item of the Day costs me around $2000, If I were to sell pretty much the exact same item back I get like $60. This leads to me wanting to use the vendors less and less because money seems harder to come by and buying one or two things depletes my reserves for a pretty long time - and  I loot ALL the things. I wish higher rarity weapons truly showed that they were better in this game like they should be.\n\nThe Oxygen thing is honestly neutral for me. It doesn't add to the game much, but it doesn't take from it either. I hardly notice it as almost every enemy drops oxygen tanks. If you're running low, kill something and there's an 80% chance it'll drop a tank. If one isn't enough that's what Kraggons are for.\n\nTo sum everything up though, I have really enjoyed my experience so far. Things are a little less polished than I'd like, but I'm sure it'll be fixed in patches. There were no beta testers for this game and I'm sure most play testing was done on limited varieties of hardware. You cannot expect it all to run exactly the same on 20,000 different computer setups as well as the consoles it was released on. I'd recommend the game if you enjoyed the previous ones. If you are worried about these issues though, wait until it hits a sale. This is Steam, there's gonna be sales.\n\nEDIT: I've hit about 30 hours of gameplay now and I think I've grown to like the game more. I played through first as Athena and really didn't like her, then started as Wilhelm and enjoyed him but found he seemed to be underleveled and I got killed a lot. Now obviously the level is up to me to move, but I like to play through games without doing side quests first to experience the story, and then I play again and do achievements and sidequests. You can get through a really large chunk of the game this way, and then I got stuck around level 20 fighting level 25+ enemies. Restarted as Nisha because I figured if I had to grind I may as well try the last character! She's definitely my favorite, though her ability is a bit underwhelming on multiplayer haha.\n\nI find that once you get farther into the game and do side missions the issues I had with loot and money seem to go away for the most part, so I think I can mostly retract that. Still not a fan of vendor gouging though; I've seen orange level rarity weapons at vendors for well over 35,000 while everything else they're selling is around $1000. It feels like they're taunting you! I hadn't even FOUND that much money at that point in the game!\nI've also gotten more used to the different gravity and while I originally thought it made you a bit slower I find that I can get around really fast by using the oxygen boost (double jump). There are oxygen geysers everywhere so it's not a big deal to burn that extra few O2.  I still stand by my recommendation for this game. If you like Borderlands, you're going to like this game.\n\nAlso, thanks for the rates and comments.","October 15, 2014","true","65.9"," 1,160 of 1,453 people (80%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","80","160","1","18","24"

But will you want to play it ?\n\nBorderlands TPS takes place after the events of Borderlands and before the events of Borderlands 2 and follows on four new vault hunters. Athena, Wilhelm, Nisha and Claptrap get a message from a hyperion worker who happens to be Handsome Jack. After the Dahl soldiers take over the space station they try to destroy the moon of Elpis and it's up to you to stop them.\n\nGameplay is identical to Borderlands 2. The only new thing is the new Oxygen system. You have a bar which starts to drain when you are outside the oxygen field for too long. Then you start to suffocate. You can also use the double jump to get on higher platforms. You can avoid the oxygen system by picking Claptrap as your character. The new abilities are awesome and all of them are very fun to use.\n\nGraphics are stunning as ever. They look awesome and all the colors are very nice to look at. The textures are kind of mediocre and some of the character models look very bad. Overall the game looks great apart from minor flaws.\n\nAudio is pretty bad. The game's audio for me stopped during firefights and I couldn't hear anything the characters would say to me and sometimes the Echo Com screen didn't transfer the dialogue and I couldn't hear anything which wasn't a problem in Borderlands 2. The soundtrack is alright, there are some great songs but a lot of them are kind of mediocre.\n\nThe game is pretty easy for the most part until the final chapter where there is a massive difficulty spike and the final boss solo is incredibly hard. The boss fights are very team oriented meaning the game expected you to play with people from the start.\n\nLevel Design in some parts is abysmal it took me massive amounts of understanding where my objective was and where the side quest start. This by far the worst level design in a borderlands game.\n\nThe game took me 22 hours to complete every quest and to get to level 27. The game like other Borderlands games has tons of replay value with different vault hunter modes and trying out other characters and of course not to mention the DLC which I will have to check out one day.\n\nThe game is pretty stable from the most part. There where some parts where the game wouldn't open a certain door to progress through a quest but a quick reload always fixed the problem.\n\nOverall this game is not as good as the other titles in the series and without a doubt not worth it at the full price. I am a massive Borderlands fan and Pre Ordered this game once I saw it and I can safely say it wasn't a bad game but it's not as good as the other Borderlands games. For other people only buy this on a sale. It has a lot of horrible side quests but this is an overall good game and I highly suggest you to check it out on a sale. I give Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel a 7/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","July 16, 2015","true","25.8"," 245 of 284 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","245","284","6","4"

This game simply just did not deliver. Gearbox handed the reigns off to 2K Australia and it seriously suffered. Lemme give you the run down:\n\nPOSITIVE\n\n+ Buttslams and low gravity are fun as hell, and make combat in this game incredibly satisfying and borderline addictive\n+ 4 new(ish) vault hunters with great skill trees and little to no skills that absolutely suck (lookin' at you More Pep & Flicker from BL2)\n+ Each vault hunter is more chatty and has unique dialogue to chime in with during story and side mission conversations\n+ The Grinder is a great tool for helping you get that specific gear you're looking for by putting in the correct ingredient weapons\n+ Laser weapons are friggin' sweet! Pewpewpew!\n+ New vehicle, the Stingray, is unique in being the first solo-rider-only\n+ Vending machines have significantly higher chances to have an orange item as the item of the day (like BL1 chances)\n\nNEGATIVE\n\n- 90% of orange items in this game are DIRECT PORTS or RESKINS of guns from BL2. Some are even clones with very small mechanical changes as if to pass it off as something brand new. There are a VERY SMALL handful of completely new orange weapons\n- As a cherry on top of that issue, a large group of bosses and mini-bosses that have specific orange weapons tied to their loot drops NEVER RESPAWN. You get one shot to get their loot. Good luck or have fun Alt+F4ing\n- Don't forget the chocolate sauce for this sundae of dissapointment! The Grinder WAS cool until you find yourself rely on it nearly completely as a source of oranges during end-game because you got no BOSSES TO FARM.\n- As if finding ported oranges wasn't bad enough, welcome back a few freakin' direct port quest uniques! REALLY 2kAUS?? They burn you on the oranges and then even get too lazy to make UNIQUE quest rewards for this game\n- Areas of the map include lots and lots of long uninteresting treks across the moon until you unlock the vehicles\n- The soundtrack in this game is not very interesting. It's all just kinda bland space trancey stuff. BL2 (especially the pirate dlc) had some absolutely sick music\n- enemies are very watered down in variance. Basically you have bandits in space suits (but much less variety of them), dahl soldiers, kraggons (they're cool), shugaraths (only on 1 map though) space spiderants and eridians. They cut out badass psychos, nomads, goliaths, varkids, bullymongs and crystalisks completely. The amount of new enemies is very much out-weighed by what you lost\n- enemies don't really say anything memorable. In  BL2 the bandits and hyperion personal said some hilarious things in the middle of battle. Scavs on the moon just say a lot of aussie mumbo jumbo. I mean it's lightly amusing, but the delight of the accent wears off soon and the dialogue itself is not that funny.\n- Once you hit 50 there isn't a lot to do. With all the recycled oranges from BL2 and the issues of their bosses never respawning why do you even bother farming? Oh that's right so you can take what you do from farming vending machines and put it in the grinder. gee thats fun, whoopee!\n- The season pass is very pail compared to BL2's pass. It includes 2 characters (Handsome Jack's doppleganger and Hamerlock's sister, Aurelia) 1 arena dlc called the Holodome (also comes with +10 levels) and 1 campaign dlc (+10 more levels included, so max level cap will be 70). So in total that's 2 characters, 1 arena and 1 campaign. Let me remind you BL2 had FOUR campaigns in their season pass and still had 2 characters dlc you could get serperately from the pass (Gaige was even free with preorder of BL2)\n- The story isn't all that impressive, and leaves some pretty big questions unaswered for the viewer. But you form your own opinion on the story, if anything the unique dialogue from each vault hunter is very fun to listen to.\n\nIn summary, this game is not woth the $60 price tag. I would reccommend waiting for a sale that drops it to $45 or lower.\n\nThe pre-sequel is a fun game for the first play-through for fans of the franchise and newcomers. Play-through 2 and endgame will largely dissapoint the hardcore fans that enjoy the series so much, though.\n\n7/10 PSYCHO MIDGETS (wait, we call them little people on the moon now)","December 17, 2014","false","123.4"," 1,153 of 1,468 people (79%) found this review helpful 49 people found this review funny","79","153","1","49","36"

If you still want more after that, then play the campaign expansions and upgrade packs. If you still want more after that, then, and only then, can I recommend Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel.\n\nINTRODUCTION: I've been a fan of the series for a few years now. Though I only played Borderlands in anticipation for Borderlands 2, it still quickly became my favorite game. Until Borderlands 2 came along that is. Borderlands 2 is still my favorite game to this day, and here's why Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel doesn't even come close.\n\nBefore Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel even came out I heard statements describing it as more Borderlands 2 or an expansion of Borderlands 2, but I wouldn't even go that far. It definitely feels shorter than Borderlands 2, but that probably wouldn't have been a problem if it weren't for the level design. The areas in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel are generally pretty small compared to the vast environments in previous games, and the areas that actually are vast environments just feel empty. I get it; it's the moon. It's kind of supposed to be empty. But that doesn't make it any less dissapointing(to me at least).\n\nPersonally I think Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel has the best story in the series(yes, I do realize that's not saying much), but probably the weakest cast. Or I suppose I should say new cast. Because the player characters and all of the other characters who had appearances in previous games are great, but all of the new characters don't really have anything going for them other than various British or Australian accents. Even Janey Spring's charisma wears off in time.\n\nThe vast majority of missions in the Borderlands games have been fetch quests or thinly disguised fetch quests, but it has never been more apparent in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. I remember I would dread time trial missions in previous games, but in this game they're the only ones I look forward to doing in new game ++ simply because I know it's the closest thing to a breath of fresh air I'm going to get. All two of them that is. It's even more of a shame, because the playable characters in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel are the most fun to play as in the series. For the first time ever the character classes are completely different than those in previous games. But unfortunately we can only play as them in the underwhelming environments of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, and only while doing its boring missions.\n\nI understand that the games in the Borderlands series don't have much going for them, and the only reason to play them longer than it takes to play through their missions with a few friends is this: loot. The prospect of obtaining one-of-kind unique or legendary items has a certain appeal to those of us who are more magpie than man(such as myself). In the previous games a few missions would award rare, unique items with special abilities. But in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel almost every other side mission awards one so it doesn't feel special when the player receives one anymore. In the previous games many bosses and unique enemies had a small chance of dropping a certain legendary item upon being killed, and  if the item didn't drop the player could quit to the main menu and then the enemy would respawn the next time the player loads his or her save. This allowed these items to be "farmed". But not anymore. Now most of the enemies that drop legendary items never respawn, and the player is expected to literally grind weapons together to obtain legendary weapons. I don't know about you, but I don't think feeding guns into a slot machine and hoping I will get a legendary gun in return is nearly as exciting as fighting a giant monster or an evil mech warrior and hoping a legendary item will fly out of their back pocket as it dies. And even farming from enemies gets tedious after the thirtieth fruitless attempt. So hats off to you Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel! You managed to make farming more boring than it already was.\n\nLastly, I just want to add that yes the vehicle handling in this game is somehow even worse than Borderlands 2.","December 29, 2014","false","265.0"," 565 of 753 people (75%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","75","565","753","35","22"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hybel/recommended/261640/","Hybel","Couchfighter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hybel/","236 products in account","Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel\nReleased: Oct 2014\nDeveloper: 2K Australia, Gearbox Software, Aspyr\nPublisher: 2K, Aspyr\n\nImpressions:\nBorderlands: The Pre-Sequel (TPS) is Borderlands 2 (BL2) again, and as one who really enjoyed both BL1, BL2 and pretty much devoured all the dlc for those games it is a very enjoyable game to play.  However, for those who didn't for any reason enjoy the previous releases, you can stop reading here, this game will not get you hooked.\n\nNew in this version is that you're playing on a moon, meaning in large parts of the game there is low gravity, and no oxygen.  You're given Oz kits that allow you to boost for extra jump height as well giving you much more speed and maneuverability, as well as the ability to slam down onto enemies on the ground. Oh, and they let you breathe which can also be handy sometimes.\n\nMost enemies you fight will also be wearing space helmets to allow breathing that can be shattered, making them suffocate.  This is actually a significant gameplay change from BL2, since these helmets are much larger critical spots and easy to hit, unlike headshots in BL2 which could at times be tricky to land on erratic moving enemies.  Another difference is that unless you're fighting in areas with oxygen, fire weapons can not cause burn damage, funny how that works.\n\nOther gameplay changes include a new laser weapon type, the removal of Slag damage from BL2 (thank you!), the inclusion of cold elemental damage which can freeze enemies solid allowing you to shatter them with a quick melee strike, and relics being replaced by the aforementioned Oz kits.  Last but not least TPS stars 6 new character classes, making TPS feel fresh despite its many similarities with BL2.\n\nAs someone odd enough to have actually enjoyed the stories told and the lore from the previous games, TPS delivers.  The writing is hardly award winning material, but the story from the perspective of mercenaries hired by Jack before the events of BL2 has him starring as the main villain is an interesting one.  TPS also features the usual humour and puns, for which the appreciation will of course be very hit or miss.  Personally I've had quite a few laughs and will at least give a sympathetic smirk each time the game throws a funny at you.\n\nIf you're in the mood for more Borderlands, and haven't had a go at TPS yet, it is a fairly easy recommendation for me to make.  Well worth picking up during a sale along with the season pass which includes a couple characters and a story dlc.\n\nPros: Slag is gone, and all is well!\nBetter PhysX optimization compared to BL2.  I very rarely see fps drop below 60 even during hectic firefights on my trusty old GTX 680 2GB.\nWhile I was sceptical at first, the moon environment works quite well, and changes up the gameplay a bit from BL2.\nEnjoyable story and humour in the same style of previous games.\nNew 'Grinder' machine in the main town that lets you combine weapons and gear into new, possibly improved ones.  A smart move, meaning there's always going to be something to spend your money on. The cashmoneys in BL2 quickly lost any real value outside of buying ammo.Cons:  Diehard BL2 grinders beware, TPS does not offer the endgame raid challenges and OP levels of BL2, because....\nNot long after release, the dev studio that released TPS closed its doors.  Some of the DLC released was actually produced in house at Gearbox, just so there could be enough value in the season pass.  It is looking extremely unlikely that there will be more DLC or other updates released for TPS.\nThere's a few bugs.  One particularly annoying bug is that your character sometimes gets perma-slowed after taking cold damage, forcing you to restart the game to be able to move around at normal speeds.\nLargely forgettable soundtrack.  Some areas don't even have a music score, just ambient background sound.\nRe-uses quite a few uniques and legendaries from BL2.","September 28, 2015","true","209.0"," 172 of 209 people (82%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","82","172","209","10","8"

But, I don't really know what to say about it.  Did I have fun playing? Yes.  Was there anything about the game that bothered me? TONS!\n\n...Do I recommend it?\n\nAbsolutely!\n\nI have a lot of hours spent playing the previous two Borderlands titles.  Nearly 100 hours in the first game, and I'm 2 hours shy of 500 for Borderlands 2.  My opinion may be a bit biased, because I am a huge fan of the series.  If you didn't enjoy the previous games, don't bother with this one.. it's not going to be any better for you.\n\nIf you find yourself disappointed in the price, or the length of the game, or the fact that it is a 'reskinned Borderlands 2'.. You shouldn't be.  They were absolutely transparent about these things.  They said right from the start that the game is built off of Borderlands 2.  They said right from the start that it would not be as huge.  If you're new to the series.. this may have bothered you.  But if you followed this game at all before it was released, you knew exactly what you were getting long before it came out.\n\nAs far as the pros and cons go, I do not find that there are many of either, meaning that most the game is a double edged sword- but even given that, I find the balance to be well done most of the time.\n\nFor example...\nThe whole low gravity and oxygen system.\nI love the low gravity, I think it adds a whole new aspect to the game.. the whole "How the hell am I going to get over there?" thing.  But it has a downside as well.  When you kill enemies, whatever they drop doesn't always just fall to the ground.  It often flies into places you cannot easily find it, or worse, places you cannot get it at all... like, off the map.\nAs far as the oxygen system goes, I love the double jump mechanic and the butt slams you get with the Oz kits.  I love how you can shatter enemy masks and cause another type of DOT.  But actually having to manage an oxygen level is more of an annoyance than anything.  Even that has 2 edges though.  Many Oz kits have perks based on your oxygen levels.  But when you're just trying to wander across a map for a quest.. having to stop what you're doing periodically and refill is a pain.\n\nLazer weapons.  Some of the best guns in the game are lazer weapons, so are some of the worst guns in the game.  Some have excellent damage, excellent aim, and a good continuous damage bonus and will just absolutely shred everything you come across.. unless of course the enemies are beyond the range of what your weapon can do or you are outside of an atmosphere.\n\nDriving.  The stingray is actually really fun to take out and drive around and once you get the hang of it you will find you can get it into some pretty creative spots.  The car though, I find to be horrendous to navigate around with.  It's a combination of the low gravity, and the tons of little 'invisible walls' you can hit.\n\nBosses and loot.  This was one of the things that bugged me the most about this game actually.  Many of the bosses do not respawn, and the majority of the legendary items don't really have that one baddie that has a higher chance to drop them.  But, vending machines have a much higher chance of having legendary items in them, and there is the grinder.  It may be easier, but farming bosses was a huge thing for me in Borderlands 2.  Of course, the update coming with the claptrap dlc includes a pleasingly large list of bosses that will respawn now, and the loot pool of one that doesnt, being moved to one that will.\n\nAnyway.  There are some bugs.. there are some really annoying things, like 'invisible walls'.. some parts of the floor or rocks or whatever that are not solid when you're trying to navigate to tricky areas or just randomly exploring the edges of the world.  But personally, I find stuff like that to be part of what Borderlands has always been.  When I fall through a rock, sure it's annoying.  But, I can't help but think to myself, "Of course I would fall through that."\n\nIt doesnt seem like I mentioned many good things about this game does it.\nIt's there.  I really enjoyed the story, and watching Handsome Jack become what he is in Borderlands 2.  I was completely immersed through my first play through, I enjoyed exploring the completely new areas.  I really like the new player classes.  The humour was there, and that Borderlands feel was there.  If you liked the previous games in this series, and realize that this is not 'Borderlands 3', I think you will enjoy it as well.","March 22, 2015","true","115.4"," 274 of 353 people (78%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","78","274","353","14","16"

The original Vault has been opened, and there are rumors of another Vault on Elpis, the moon of Pandora. Elpis is a barren place, rocky and lacking in gravity, but Jack, a low-level programmer working for Hyperion, the evil corporation from Borderlands 2, has hired a new team of Vault Hunters to head to the moon and look for the Vault..\n\nIn fact, The Pre-Sequel basically centers around Jack, who isn’t quite Handsome yet. Instead, he’s toiling away on the Hyperion Helios space station, trying to make a name for himself. If you’ve ever played Borderlands 2 and wondered how Jack ended up the crazed, slightly mad psychopath that he is, this game answers that question. To avoid spoiling any of it, let’s just say that the Jack you meet early on in the Pre-Sequel is not the same man you see later in the game. Events will change him.\n\nThe Vault Hunters in The Pre-Sequel are much more well-rounded characters than their counterparts in the previous games. 2K Australia had said they wanted the characters to have more interaction and dialogue, and they’ve accomplished both of those things in fine fashion. It’s not unusual to have your Vault Hunter actually carry on a conversation while accepting a quest or receiving an ECHO call, rather than just mutely acquiescing and carrying on.\n\nThe additional dialogue is a really nice touch, as it gives you more of an insight into the character that you’re playing. Rather than the nearly-silent protagonist of past Borderlands games, you get a glimpse of what each Vault Hunter’s motivations are here, and it adds immensely to the experience. There’s always been an incentive to replay Borderlands in the “True Vault Hunter” modes and beyond, and this new dialogue actually makes me want to replay it with all the different characters as well.\n\nThe Pre-Sequel doesn’t tamper much with the ludicrous number of guns you usually get access to in Borderlands games. Instead, it adds to it with two new types of weapons: Cryo and Laser. Cryo guns will freeze enemies solid if you deal enough damage, allowing you to then shatter them into tiny pieces with a well-placed blow. It also acts as a bit of crowd control in some situations. Laser weapons come in in both the Star Wars-style repeating blasters, or the Star Trek-style continuous-beam variety. Both types are fun to use, and of course offer the full range of elemental damage bonuses.\n\nAlso added to the mix in The Pre-Sequel are the O2, or “OZ” Kits. You’ll always need one of these equipped, as it provides you with oxygen to breathe when you’re out on the moon’s surface. In addition, the kit provides a number of effects, depending on what stats you have. Some kits might increase you damage with a certain elemental type, while others let oxygen canisters also act as healing. Managing your oxygen becomes a bit of a game within the game, although there are so many places to recharge that you’ll rarely have to run far if you run out. Oxygen also powers one of my favorite mechanics in the game: boosting.\n\nWhen you jump, you can vent your oxygen to jump farther, higher, or even change directions in midair. This, coupled with the complete lack of falling damage in Borderlands, opens up a world of possibilities for exploration, and 2K Australia has wisely chosen to reward that instinct. You’ll find lore stored on ECHO recorders, crates and weapons caches in the out-of-the-way places you can access with this newfound mobility.\n\nDespite looting a ton of weapons in my playthrough, though, I constantly felt like I was struggling to find upgrades for my gear. I ended up using the set same weapons for far longer than I was really comfortable with, simply because I couldn’t find appropriate upgrades — which is something of a problem for a franchise whose primary draw is the ever-present hunt for better loot. It’s hard to knock the game for that, though. A random system that generates the huge number of weapons that Borderlands uses will sometimes result in getting a lot of loot that you just can’t use. Still, it can be frustrating when it happens.\n\nThe biggest change in The Pre-Sequel is the most obvious — the setting. We’re on the moon now, and 2K Australia has nailed the low-gravity feeling that such a setting demands. Even running animations look strange in the lower gravity environments as characters take longer, floatier strides. As mentioned above, the lack of gravity contributes to a greater verticality in the game, and it’s a good thing.\n\nAnother nice touch is how the new environments can be used against your enemies. If you’re out in a vacuum, you can shoot the oxygen masks off baddies, leaving them to take constant damage until they reach an atmosphere or suffocate. You can activate oxygen field generators to allow your fire weapons to burn targets. Most amusingly, you can drop a grenade at an enemy’s feet to literally blow him off the ground — and into orbit.\n\nOutside of the setting, all of the changes in The Pre-Sequel aren’t really new features, so much as they’re fleshing out and expanding on things already within the franchise. 2K Australia really didn’t monkey around with Gearbox’s Borderlands formula very much, and while some might wish they’d done more, this is very much a case of “If it isn’t broke, don’t try to fix it.” As a result, The Pre-Sequel is that rare game that gets handed off to a different developer and manages to avoid a massive drop in quality. Instead, it builds on the system and successes of its forbears.\n\nBorderlands: The Pre-Sequel is exactly what fans of the series wanted in a new installment — more Borderlands. It keeps everything that made Borderlands 2 great, and adds a few new tricks of its own. It might not be innovative, but it’s damn fun to play. Honestly, isn’t that what really matters?","January 24","true","98.4"," 95 of 121 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","95","121","6","2"

Yes it has a new story, yes it will close the gap, but you will crawl through this bored and sick of fighting through hordes of forgettable enemies and bosses.\n\nDo not let all the positive reviews and fanboys sway you either, if you've played Borderlands 2, and Tiny Tina's Assault, you'll understand why this isnt worth the Price Tag. The Fanboys will cry "It has new everything, new classes, new skills, new areas, new enemies"\nNo, its Borderlands 2 with 4 new classes.\nYou found New areas and New enemies in Tiny Tinas DLC, just as you'll find new enemies and areas here, only difference is most of these enemies are just reskinned Bandits and remodeled Skags and Spiderants.\nWhy werent we charged $60 for Tiny Tinas? You got the same "New Content" there as you do here??\n\nAt release, you will find many bugs, some game-breaking. The ones talked about most are quest items flying into unreachable areas, or NPCs getting stuck in walls causing a restart. These of course will be fixed, but right now be aware they are present.\n\nThe Low-Gravity and Oxygen aspects are a nice experiment, but let me tell you the sheer amount of oxygen thrown at you when you dont need it, and the lack when you do, makes it such a god damn chore, you wonder why its even in the game. Oh and BTW you are the only one with a limit on your oxygen, the enemies and NPCs can wander around infinitely without having to replenish theirs. So while you're scrambling to find that O2 they're floating towards you following you whereever you go. Oh and pretty much every enemy has a jetpack and always follows so theres no more hiding and using cover.\n\nThe Low Gravity makes traveling the world quicker, and engaging enemies faster, which is counter balanced by fighting off enemies by the hundreds. The firefights get so tedious and boring you'll find yourself frequently hitting ESC to take a break. Forget about using the Low Gravity to reach neat and cool areas, because theres nothing to find, no hidden chests like in the older titles, what you will find however, are invisible walls, random spots that instant kill you, getting stuck somewhere you cant jump out and even falling through the world.\n\nThe Butt-Slam is also a nice little experiment but in actuality, it does more harm than good. You deal more damage shooting enemies in mid air for some reason, and can manuever more easily gliding around in the low gravity. The Second you Butt-Slam down to deal minimal damage to your enemies, this makes you a prime target from all the melee and jet-pack 'Scavs' and you'll find yourself fighting for your life frequently after butt-slamming.\n\nJust about every quest is some kind of Fetch-Quest and will drive you across the world to flip a switch, then have to cross to the other side to flip another, with many boring and slow fire-fights between. Sometimes you'll flip a switch only to find that for some reason it didnt work, and to resolve it, is to go somewhere else and flip another, but wait that didnt work either, well guess what theres one more switch back at the other side of the world you can flip that may get it going. You'll enter an enemy stronghold only to find they locked the door, forcing you to crawl your way through what is now  a maze of a base to unlock that door, return, and enter it. Once inside, guess what, another locked door causing you to crawl through.\n\nThe bosses, are boring, and forgettable. Really all you have to do is shoot them from a far and avoid their attacks. They dont have much life to them either, some even lack animations. They're like a floating statue that talks and shoots at you, they dont even move. Atleast with borderlands 2, the opening scenes were very interesting and well designed. Boom Bewm, Bad Maw, the Bunker, Flynt. They were all interesting, unique and had amazing opening scenes. In TPS, every boss is like fighting Wilhelm in BL2. Lame, boring, no animations, nothing unique about it, you do it because you have to to progress.\n\nOh and the Memes, cant forget that internet driven humor that will make you cringe every time you hear and see it. Borderlands 2 was bad with the forced memes, but this takes the cake.\n\nHonestly, I'm disappointed with this title. I am forcing myself to play it because I am a big fan of Borderlands. I've sunk hundreds of hours into BL2, and Hundreds more into BL1 for both PC and Xbox 360. The fact that they are charging $60 for reskinning BL2 and adding lackluster and forgettable enemies and features, is a slap to the face.\nThey built Borderlands 1 from scratch and charged you $60\nThey built Borderlands 2 off a heavily modified and upgraded BL1, with massive content, and charged you $60\nThey built Borderlands TPS by reskinning BL2, with little "content", and charged you $60\nWhy?\nBecause Greed.","October 13, 2014","false","26.8"," 1,277 of 1,934 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","277","1","4","86"

BL2 is larger, better and costs less. Either buy BL2, or wait for at least -50%\n\nThis review will be more comparison-style, so you're supposed to be familiar with series.\nI don't remember Borderlands 1, just remember that I liked it, I love Borderlands 2 and I really, really want to love Pre-Sequel. But I don't. Here's why.\n- Price. It costs twice as much as BL2, but it has way less content in base game than BL2 had. We got less plot, less side-quests, less locations. Season Pass doesn't look good too, instead of 4 plot DLC, expanding the story, world and bla bla bla... It includes 1 story, 2 characters and arena DLC. Shock Drop Slaughter Pit is another one-map arena, that lacks any interest. BL2 Pre-Order bonuses were - golden keys, 3 starting weapons, one relic and Mechromancer DLC. TPS Pre-Order includes a map. Thanks, I guess... It's a little more than nothing...\n- Plot. Well, it's cool to go through it, just to learn what happened between BL1 and BL2. And that's it.\n- Bosses. Most bosses are somewhat forced, you don't see their motivation, why are they against you. The only character that really made me feel something was Felicity AI, this was the most emotional character. The main antagonist, colonel Zarpedon was pretty badass. Everyone else were just boring, I just felt like I was putting them out of their misery.\n- Raid Boss. I killed it in singleplayer on 28 LVL as Athena. So either Athena is OP, or boss is pretty meh... (not mentioning what is this raid boss and how lazy devs became)\n- Customization. BL2 had nice, badass, cool, funny, even cute heads. I was choosing what I liked most, often changing head, because this one was cool too, and that is awesome, and this is funny. Here, in TPS I was choosing what I disliked least. Often it was just default head. Heads are pretty hard to acquire. I mean you need to grind, farm bosses, because heads drop rarely and if they drop, it's 85% not for your character. BL2 had more heads as rewards, ensuring class match.\n- Vehicle controls. Okay, that's pretty old topic about Borderlands. But this is a third game, and not only they didn't make usual vehicle controls, but they added some strange modifications of their unique controls, such as "reverse steering". That means whenever you press W your car will move in your facing direction even if it's backwards. Who needs this? And why in the world does it exist? Why don't we get optional controls where W is throttle, S breaks, A-D is turning, allowing us to watch and shoot sideways? That's what all games have - HL2, UT2004-UT3, BF2-Hardline... It's the third game in franchise. Third. It's about time.\n\nOkay, time for bright side. Not everything is bad. This still is an expansion to history. We still got cool classes, main characters, soundtrack, atmosphere, Grinder(tm), lasers, Butt Slams(tm), mayhem, CL4P-TP Units, Unreal Tournament's Manta (basically). Many things make this game fun, and main thing is a coop. So this is a nice way to spend time with friends. But $60? That's too much, I think.","April 28, 2015","false","136.6"," 186 of 268 people (69%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","69","186","268","8","24"

I am a huge Borderlands fan and have logged hundreds of hours playing the Borderlands games. Hundreds. Thousands, even. But I just can’t seem to be able to find a way to like the Pre-Sequel or even get a bit absorbed into it. Not even a bit.\nFirst thing is….I hate platformers. I hate them. I do not find them fun in any way at all. Sadly, the Pre-Sequel has so many platformer style elements in it that it made me crazy. Jump here, jump there, shoot while jumping, slam down from jumping, etc, etc, etc. They devs want you to jump so freakin much in this game that I found it really frustrating.\nThere are devices in the game where you get bonuses for shooting while jumping; you get bonuses for throwing grenades while jumping; and so on. There’s “jump pads” all throughout the game that propel you into the air so you can jump some more, because the devs felt that you can never freaking jump enough for their liking in this game evidently.   And because a great portion of the game is played in a low gravity environment, your jumps take on a floating/flying/falling sort of feel where you have only a small bit of control over your character while you are in the air. Yuck.\nThere are side quests that you cannot complete unless you find just the exact right spot to jump to get an item to complete the quest. I abandoned those quests after jumping wrong and falling to my death (and therefore losing some of my cash) so many times that it made my head spin. I died a hundred times by misjudging stupid jumps in this game and it made me sick. And beyond that, there are sections of the game where you MUST make blind jumps, where you can't see where the heck you're going to land. And you die. Boo.\nThere are places in the game that you can jump to safely......but you can't jump out. And you die some more. Boo. It sucked all the fun out of the game for me. Maybe this sort of jumpy thing is your cup of tea, but it sure isn’t mine.\nApart from the stupid jumping aspect of the game, I found the characters boring and dull, with action skills that were rather boring and dull, too. And the soundtrack music blows. Dreadful. Awful.\nThe story line was kinda cool, though. It really gives you some insights into the whole Borderlands tale. Other than that, I am just broken hearted about this latest Borderlands installment.\nSo, anyone have any ideas what else I might consider playing now that I am through playing the PreSequel? Oh, by the way, no platformers, please.\nPeace.","March 28, 2015","false","86.5"," 490 of 754 people (65%) found this review helpful 66 people found this review funny","65","490","754","66","49"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johniskill/recommended/261640/","johniskill","Renegade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johniskill/","157 products in account","Edit 17/12/14: A surprising number of people have rated my review so I thought it would be worth adding an update. I've now completed the game in normal mode and TVHM, but my view of the game hasn't changed much. TVHM felt slightly more challenging and combat was a bit better as I could use Athena's skills which I unlocked in my first playthrough, plus I could do the majority of the side quests at a suitable level and didn't find that most of the missions were marked at trivial difficulty, which was the case all the time in my first playthrough. I still can't recommend the game at full price however, and I'll explain why. Some players may have really enjoyed their first playthrough of this game, but in my opinion I found it disappointing (for lack of a better word) that I had to endure an experience which was mostly pretty boring before the game actually got interesting. This was disappointing for me because I personally found the previous games, particularly Borderlands 2, to be enjoyable from pretty much the start, and it only got better as I progressed. As it's been said in other reviews, the game feels unpolished and not worth its price tag - the main story is short and can be tedious at times, and not many of the side quests are all that enjoyable. Plus there are a fair few irritating bugs which do stand out, and this is something that I'm hoping 2K will address before they start pumping out DLC. If you spot this game in a sale and you want to give it a try, it's worth a shot - this review is only my opinion after all, but for me, the full price still feels excessive considering what you get for your money. Now to the main review:\n\nI really did want to enjoy this game. First off, I'd call myself a fan of Borderlands - I've played and completed both of the previous games, I've clocked nearly 300 hours on the second one and purchased almost all of the DLC. I told myself I would wait until I had completed this game before leaving a review, but the more I play it, the less likely it seems that I will even bother finishing a single playthrough.\n\nThis game started off fairly fun around the point where you first get to fiddle around with some of the new stuff like low gravity, butt slamming, and laser guns, but as I progressed through the story, it became more and more repetitive and tedious, with little signs of it getting any better. The main issues for me are combat, missions, and what you get for your money. Anywhere I go in this game, I don't feel sufficiently challenged, even when I take on missions where the recommended level is a level or two higher than my character, I still get through just fine and I wouldn't put this success down to skill. There's certainly none of the thrill of giving it everything you've got and feeling satisfied when you succeed or ready to try again if you did not - a feeling that I experienced many times in the second game playing as Krieg. In this game, I couldn't decide whether to play as Claptrap or Athena, not because I was spoiled for choice, but because the other two characters, particularly Nisha, have actions skills which are essentially "press F to win". While I gladly would have chosen a character who had an action skill consistently similar to Krieg's skill from BL2, Athena was the only character who appeared to be bringing something new and moderately appealing to the table. Her action skill sounds and looks cool, but the problem is I find it to be almost useless, as the majority of enemies have such poor aim that the shield barely gains any charge from their ranged attacks, and melee attacks from enemies hardly seem to charge it either. On top of this, the skills available for Athena don't seem to improve combat at all. From the characters I played as in BL2, you could access something new for Krieg (e.g. Light the Fuse, or Hellfire Halitosis) and Zer0 (e.g. Execute) from a relatively low level, giving you plenty of game time to try them out and have fun in the process. Compared to Athena's skill tree, any significant game changing skills can't be unlocked until around level 25, and it seems highly likely that waiting to reach this level before you take on the end game missions would only make them far too easy and just as tedious as the majority of other missions in the game.\n\nFinally, this leads to my main issue with the game, being what you get for your cash. At full price, this game is £30, and it already has DLC out. I'd have to argue that this game shouldn't even be close to £30 as it is. I wouldn't mind it if for this price, you got a bit more variety and a chance to test out the skills you unlocked during the main story in something other than just a slightly harder repeat playthrough. It's clear that DLC will be on the way for this game and while some of it might end up being fairly good, it still won't justify the cost of the base game and it's unlikely it will redeem where the base game went wrong, particularly if the DLC itself has yet another hefty price tag to match.\n\nOverall, this game is OK, but I can't justify a positive review nor the price of this game, as it seems far too much like a poor and rushed attempt by the developers of an otherwise revered series to acquire a load of quick and easy cash at the expense of the fans who were expecting something a bit different.","December 1, 2014","false","70.1"," 355 of 542 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","355","542","2","0"

Buy on sale for 50% off, or buy BL2 if you haven't yet.\n\nThis review is going to focus more on negatives since this is basically BL2 with a new coat of paint.\n\nFirst off the Voice Acting. I remember an episode of Family Guy where Peter was creating a cartoon about Handicapped Ducks and when recording voicing, Cleveland gives one of the characters an Australian accent which Peter gets angry because the character is from the Moon and has a Moon accent. Well in BL:TPS all characters on the Moon have an Australian accent. While this was developed by an Australian company, you'd think they'd put some diversity in there.\n\nThink about the worst mission-line in BL2. Go on take a few minutes before reading ahead....If you thought about the Cult Following mission-line in Frostburn Canyon, you were right! If you didn't say Cult Following mission-line then you did a good job suppressing the memory of doing this side mission. Well, if you suppressed the memory, let me remind you how it goes.\nAfter you complete the story mission in Frostburn Canyon, you now out-level the zone, and Lilith sends you back to the zone to deal with fire cultists. This leads you running around the zone for a while killing non-challenging things till you get to the part where you have to burn the midget. You then have to go back to the starting zone, run past 15 minutes worth of beginner level trash and a boss till you reach Captain Flynt and burn the midget, which you have to trek back across the starter zone to get back to FrostBurn Canyon which all the trash has respawned in, and you have to fight your way to the end of it to finish the mission. Wow such a fun mission, but why have I brought this up?\nINSTEAD OF REALISING "HEY PEOPLE HATED THIS ANNOYING MISSION, LET'S NOT DO IT AGAIN!" THEY INSTEAD MADE EVERY SINGLE SIDE MISSION WORK EXACTLY LIKE THIS MISSION.\nGet ready to go back to zones after you've finished them all the time. I wish I would've counted how many missions send you to the area outside the main city, that places has side missions for level 6, level 11, level 15, and level 25, and it's a freaking level 10 zone. My favorite is the Veins of Helios zone. This is the most pain in the ♥♥♥ zone in any borderlands game. It's full of platforming, has 2 giant space areas, and contains no fast travel points so you have to trek across another zone to reach it. After you complete the story mission here, you get a side mission to go back oh joy! Then you trek back to do the mission, complete it, trek back to the start point to turn it in and you're given 2 god damn ♥♥♥♥ing more missions to go back there in almost the exact same damn area of the zone. DIDN'T ANY OF THE PLAYTESTERS NOTICE HOW BAD THIS WAS?!?!?\n\nSpeaking of platforming, who the hell said, "Man you know what Borderlands 2 is missing? Platforming!" No one did, yet the whole o2 system and double jumping was basically built for this. The platforming is down right annoying especially in the Veins of Helios area, and pretty much any mission that involves you finding the right dumpster to jump on just so you can reach the roof of a building. It's just not fun.\n\nCryo and Lasers do add a lot to the game, but they're both extremely overpowered. Found a legendary cryo smg at level 12 and used it all the way to the final boss (and it'll still be good starting vault hunter mode) because of the massive dps boost cryo gives due to frozen headshots. Then, lasers are usually 193x5 damage with 210% weapon continuality bonus on them so you can use them to 1-2 hit Badasses or burn through a boss in record time.\n\nAll this put together just makes it a tedious game. Buy this when it's on sale, and play Borderlands 2 for the best experience.","October 29, 2014","false","18.5"," 751 of 1,170 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","751","1","2","39"

Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the game with each of it's components, the playable vault hunters in the game are satisfying, and are very rewarding at times! If you would just want to see the overall statement, scroll all the way down to the final two paragraphs.\n\nFirst off, this is my own opinion. I'm sure others have their own aswell, and I'm fine with that. For me, the game could have more potential in it. It started out sweet, but ended up rough. I felt like the game could've used more of one thing every now and then, but it just wasn't there. And if it was there, it was either screwed up or realy buggy.\n\nThe game feels unbalanced. I went on to True Vault Hunter Mode, did every side quest up to one of the bosses, and he was 37. I was 34, even with the challenges done from all the side quests just to get up to a boss that is still higher than you. I felt like the leveling system could be more adjacent and more tweaked. That being said, the side quests in the game are done properly, but some of them were unforgiving, some of them were downright challenging, and some of them were completly boring. Atleast a few side quests were entertaining, one of them was able to get the grinder, which is able to pop up better quality stuff if you put in 3 of the same quality. That being said, most of the time the grinder will pop out the same quality it was when you put the three weapons in. So even if you put 3 white weapons in, you still have a chance of getting a white weapon.\n\nI was displeased with the main story. Sure, being on Pandora's moon was really a blast, the low gravity was entertaining, and the functions of slamming down on your enemy for a good amount of a damage, but that doesn't change the fact that there were a lot of things missing. They explained Jack's backstory, but not entirely. Some of the dialogue in this game was either too bland, needed more clarification, or just didn't fit in. It also felt cheesyand rushed. The Vault Hunters you play have a lot better things to say other than most of the dialogue slapped into this. There were also important questions unanswered. How did Jack get a hold of his siren, Angel? How did Jack acquire the Destroyer's Eye?\n\nThe Vault Hunters, Athena, Nisha, Wilhelm, and Claptrap, were arguebly the best part about this game. Most of the stats seem very nifty, very thorough, and well put. Athena's skill can be used as defense, offense, or even support, making her very valueable for the team. Nisha's skill was probably the most fun I've had out of this game, walking into a room full of badasses, pulling out dual revolvers (if you chose Fan the Hammers) and literally aimbotting everyone you see. Wilhelm's skill was the most complicated, but also was fun to play. He can send out two surveyors, Wolf and Saint. One of them attacks, and one of them supports you. Claptrap was also very fun to play as, his ability can either help the team, or screw the entire team over.\n\nI felt like the game needed more new content. The story felt short, very little new dialogue from the vending machines or the hyperion new-u stations, and the enemy design still feels pathetic in my opinion. Getting one-shotted, or taking massive damage for no reason will be your questions after fighting the levels of enemies either two levels below you or are on the same level as you. Fight for your life mode really is a pain in the ♥♥♥, it really puts you in a position that tells you that you are too low for one area, or that you need a different strategy. If you fall into the mode again, you have a lower time to kill an enemy. If you fall into it once more, you have lower time to do it. And if you fall into it again, it feels instant. This is something very irritating for players to lose their money, because they couldn't get out of a spot, or some enemy AI got an extremely lucky with a sniper rifle across the map.\n\nSpeaking of the enemy design, even if it is tweaked so that it doesn't aimbot you like the threshers in borderlands 2, it still feels buggy. You are bound to get shot 3 times and fall to the ground. It's like the game's development got rough in between and they added difficulty to the game to spice it out. Unfortunally, the game feels a lot easier when you have friends, soloing it makes the game too difficult for you, so it forces you to have friends to help. But what if you don't have friends that can communicate?\n\nBugs. No, not torks, damn you, actual game bugs. I've seen enemies walking through walls, shooting through walls, hell, I managed to find an engineer throw their turret through the floor and that turret shot me through the floor. A couple times I was in fight for your life mode, killed a guy, but it didn't get me back up on me feet. Nisha's ability that is capable of aimbotting people does not work on mobs far away from you, and screws up 100.0 accuracy by making the gun that would be accurate, innaccurate.\n\nThere are some new things in the game. Ice. Yes, you can freeze your opponents, shatter them, and laugh in front of them as you shoot their head off. Grenades will now beep so you know where they are, making it a huge plus, but doesn't really do that much damage to you unless you are TVHM. There is a new weapon type, the laser. Well, there are a couple different lasers, other than the fact that they are from different manufactor, and different element, some lasers you can hold down and channel some kind of energy like you would see from Ghostbusters, some lasers are like snipers, but less accurate, and some lasers can split like a shotgun. Some of these lasers are fun, especially with Nisha's ability.\n\nBosses were unrewarding. One of the most irritating things that most boss fights in this game has is the fact that he or she has friends, and most of the times the regular enemies you fight are a lot harder than the boss. This makes the game even more unbalanced, due to the fact that boss fights should be entertaining to kill, challenging, and very rewarding, more rewarding than your average bad guy. If there were very little enemies on the battlefield on the boss, then this game would be a lot better in my opinion. Even on solo, fighting 20 enemies left and right along with a boss fight can be very frustrating. What could've been done better is if there were more stages, and having more abilities when the player count has increased, and less enemies on the field when there are only one or two people playing on the field.\n\nOverall, the gameplay does not have full potential. It felt harsh, and very little of Borderlands 2 gameplay returns here. I understand that fire does not work unless you have oxygen, but it's very hard to set people on fire because most of the time you are fighting in a non-oxygen zone.\n\nAt this point, I feel like if I give a rating right now, there will be things fixed left and right. My final verdict isn't high, but it isn't low. There really isn't a real definition to challenge to this game, you either die or outlevel enemies some way. But really, I felt like there should be more potential here and there, the game just didn't feel like what a Borderlands game should be, and there were other ways to have the story change. The begining of the story was awesome, the ending was awesome, but the middle of the story just really tore me apart, where most of the things you would've seen in Borderlands 2, didn't come into this game, like Angel.\n\nIf I was asked to rate this game out of 100, I would probably say 74/100. Maybe an 7/10. The game just needed more new content, if it did, the game would've had better potential on certain things. They may have tweaked the functions around, but they kinda made it more challenging for players to face. Still, I enjoyed the story at the best, but it's basically a large expansion to Borderlands 2.","November 1, 2014","false","90.0"," 433 of 671 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","433","671","3","22"

It does have some new features such as the low gravity, giving the ability to butt-slam your foes, new NPCs (Maniacs, Torks, Lost Legion etc) And new Vehicles so you can better & faster travel the distances on the moon.\nIt took me about 25 hours to complete, having to deal with a few side-quests in order to get in the required level before proceeding with the main-quests.\nBorderlands The Pre-Sequel is a must-own game for every Borderlands fanboy, and I can definitely recommend it at it's current price (50Euros/$60) But if you didn't care much for Borderlands 2, you should probably wait for a sale somewhere, sometime.\nThe humor of Borderlands 2 is copy-pasted perfectly into Borderlands The Pre-Sequel, even though it felt more original in Borderlands 2, nonethless it's great fun to listen to the various dialogues within the game.\nBorderlands The Pre-Sequel, or any Borderlands game in fact, is best enjoyed with friends in co/op mode, I happenend to play the main quest 100% solo and it's defiently not bad either. Do prepare to get downed alot by the horde of enemies you are facing.\nI encounted 0 bugs or flavs in my 1st playthough of the game (22/10-26/10) very well optimised game from launch.\nI rate this game 8/10 - a must buy if you're a fan of the franchise. Borderlands The Pre-Sequel is one of my favorite games of 2014.\nI hope this review helped you decide what to waste your money on.","October 25, 2014","true","551.6"," 246 of 377 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","246","377","4","8"

It feels like an extra long DLC. If you haven't played B2, go back and play it. While I do recommend the Pre-Sequel (PS), B2 is better and I would advise grabbing the PS during a sale. If you loved B2 then I definitely recommend this game.\n\nSince the PS is very nearly like B2, I'm going to highlight the differences for this review.\n\nSPACE GAMEPLAY : The biggest change is the space gameplay: low gravity, oz kits, and butt slams. Low gravity allows you to jump higher and in midair you can glide to change your direction with an oz kit. Jumping and gliding is my preferred mode of travel. At first I was annoyed with the low gravity, but after going back to B2, I found myself trying to glide and wishing I could jump higher. Oz kits are the new relics. They allow you to glide and provide you with oxygen in no oxygen environments. They have a surprising amount of effects. Running out of oxygen is not a problem at all: there are frequently placed patches with cracks in the ground and Oz domes that refill your oxygen. Butt slams are as fun as they sound. They provide a new tactical maneuver that pushes enemies away creating some breathing space. Since I have the maturity of a five year old, I love using the oz kit that farts every time I perform a butt slam. I used it for most of the game and I'm still not tired of it. Butt slams are fairly powerful and can be performed every time you jump in the air.\n\nENVIRONMENTS : About half the game is inside oxygen-rich areas and the other half is in low-oxygen areas with low gravity, which is a nice balance. The environments on Elpis are beautiful and the view of space and Elpis from Helios is fantastic. The interior environments are sort of boring, resembling other Hyperion structures from B2 (think Opportunity). With the introduction of low gravity comes the tendency for maps to extend vertically. While B2 maps were flat and spread out, many locations in the PS are designed for moving up or down. Provided jump pads launch you across the map or vertically straight into the air, allowing faster travel and setting up butt slams. Most maps that are flat end up being convoluted. Generally, looking at the map for an interior area is useless. Vehicles are almost worthless: locations either lack Moon Zoomy stations or are better traversed on foot. The Moon Buggy often clips with the environment, but the Stingray is fun. The worst thing about the environments is the sparse placement of checkpoints and fast travel stations. Nearly every time I die, I wonder, "This is the closest checkpoint?" Most locations have fast travel stations but there are some key places that don't. The PS is definitely smaller than B2.\n\nENEMIES : The enemies lack variation. B2 has a wide variety of enemies; just for humanoids you have bandits, psychos, midgets, rats, nomads, nomads with shields, bruisers, goliaths, etc.. In the PS, you basically get a guy in a space suit with midget and bigger guy variants. The creatures on the other hand are interesting but they don't make up for the lack of enemy variation elsewhere. The bosses are all interesting and unique. You never feel like you're fighting a boss that's similar to another. My one gripe with them is that they aren't farmable by any means. For most bosses, it's like trying to get to the Warrior from Hero's Pass in B2.\n\nMAIN CHARACTERS : Low-level gameplay sucks with the new characters. You start earning skill points at level 3, but it takes about 15 levels until you can get a middle-tiered skill that really changes the game for you. Playing as Claptrap, I became far more lethal at level 14 once I got friendship novas, which emanate from any enemy you kill and heal you and your teammates. I've tried all the characters and my favorite character to play as is Claptrap (no joke). One great addition to this game is the fact that your character responds in a unique way in dialogue, sort of like the characters did in Tiny Tina's DLC for B2. I really enjoy this feature because it gives life to each character. By far Claptrap's lines are the funniest. Athena tends to be serious; Nisha is provocative; Wilhelm plays the calm badass.\n\nNPCs : The NPCs in this game get very little treatment, with only a handful getting a backstory. Obviously this story is about Jack so he gets plenty of attention but most new characters are relegated to the side. Remember seeing the nurse Nina in previews of the game? If you play the main campaign you interact with her once. If you do the sidequests, you get one mission from her. Where's the backstory? You only get a small indication of her personality. Also I was also hoping to see more of Angel's relationship with Jack prior to B2's events, but she is absent from the game. Most of the characters in B2 received significant additions to personality from the first game. You really get to know them from their echos, dialogue, and missions. Don't expect the same in the PS.\n\nSTORYLINE : (In general there are spoilers in this section, so to be safe, skip it if you don't want the story spoiled.) On the whole, the story of Jack's descent into the man he is at the beginning of B2 is a decent one. It's slow at first but picks up in the middle. However, Jack's transformation feels rushed. SPOILER ALERT (Last warning.) At the beginning Jack seems entirely like a good guy. He wants to protect Pandora and Elpis from the deranged Zarpedon. Yet his methods are questionable and fall into a morally gray area. By the end he's the delusional and power hungry Hyperion CEO. Although the story felt rushed, I definitely enjoyed seeing Jack's transformation. The biggest issue I have with the story is the premise: Athena is captured by Lilith, and Lilith forces Athena to relate her entire experience with Jack. Except, as we come to find out, Lilith and Roland are there with her and Jack for most of the game and they know most of what Athena knows. In a nutshell, it feels forced. Also I dislike the ending with Lilith and Jack's final encounter---Lilith's actions were pointless and stupid. (SPOILER END.) Luckily I don't play Borderlands for the story. Comparatively, the plot in B2 is better than the plot in the PS.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS :\nThe Grinder is a welcome addition to Borderlands. It allows you to turn unwanted guns and gear into potentially better items. It's great for turning low level legendaries into higher level legendaries.\nLasers and cryo guns are entertaining and powerful. Freezing enemies and meleeing them into pieces is really effective. Lasers come in a variety of types such as single shot, continuous beam, and rapid fire. Overall these gun types are useful and fun.\nNow in multiplayer, you can view your teammate's inventory and skill trees by just walking up to them and pushing a button. It doesn't even require the teammate's approval.\nThe trash button has been tossed---now there are just non-favorite items and favorite items. I don't like this system because the auto-sell button sells any non-favorite items. Since Borderlands is all about finding better loot, I'm constantly upgrading my gear and selling the old stuff. It's easier to have non-favorite items and trash items, and auto-sell trash items. I wish they kept the three-tiered system that was in B2.\nBOTTOM LINE : Definitely recommend for those who love the series. If you're unsure, purchase during a sale. While my review seems generally negative, it's because those things stood out the most. For me B2 did almost everything right, so the negative things in the PS are noticeable. But overall I love Borderlands, so I give this a thumbs up.","December 15, 2014","true","172.8"," 254 of 391 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","254","391","4","7"

I initially had no interest but got the first one on a steam sale at the recommendation of a friend.  It instantly became my new favorite surpassing the Zelda series, Doom series, and a few classic others.  I still vividly remember my first fight against bone head, nine toes, walking into Liar's Berg then fighting Boom Bewm with childlike fervor, and above all the masterpiece that was Handsome Jack!  The most awesome villain ever.\n\nBorderlands PS however has been such an insulting let down.\nThe game is short.\nThe levels are not very fun.\nThe jokes are not funny.\nThe vehicles are frustrating to steer.\nThe season pass was a blatant rip off.\n\nIn #2 I spent hours just looking for vault symbols and it was exciting to find them, this time it was just annoying platforming to find them and I just quit looking.\n\nThe humor was awful this time.  Not sure if since this game was sub contracted to 2K Australia if I just don’t have their same sensibilities as the Aussie’s, or if they were truly just lame flat jokes(this one, it was this one).\n\nI absolutely had a stalker type lover for #2, but I didn’t care for the DLC.  I FREAKING LOVED the DLC for #1, all of it.  I believe Gearbox sub contracted the DLC for #2, but that’s ok, the main game was enough to carry itself easily since the DLC stunk.  They screwed their fans when it came to DLC for the PS.  Charging $10 a piece or 2 season pass slots for skill trees?!?  The game isn’t good enough to charge that much for another play through with a new skill tree.\n\nIn summary the borderlands franchise is still my favorite of all time.  However the Pre Sequal was so bad I will be waiting for reviews of Borderlands 3 before I make a purchase to see if they turned it around or have truly jumped the shark.\n","June 16, 2015","false","105.9"," 78 of 107 people (73%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","73","78","107","7","3"

Living in Australia, I can appreciate a few of the references (eg. “Red Belly” instead of “Ned Kelly”)\n…But as a whole, I just didn’t get it.\nEven I couldn’t understand what they were trying to say, so good luck if you're an international buyer.\nI didn’t get the humour, didn’t appreciate the forced Australian accents, and certainly didn’t enjoy the characters. AT ALL.\n\nBorderlands 2 was amazing due to its memorable characters, but I couldn't tell you who these new ones are even if you paid me. Handsome Jack (aka “Jack”) is a shadow of his future self.\n\nThere was one thing that particularly annoyed me. Indigenous relations’ has always been a problem here in Australia. There is only one obvious Aboriginal character in the entire game, and he stands there getting drunk while incoherently sending you on a side-quest. While I normally find cultural stereotypes and mild racism amusing, it’s done in such a cheap and demeaning way that even I am offended.\n\nGameplayBorderlands 2 – except less enjoyable. There’s no point using fire weapons as 70% of the time there's no atmosphere for them to be useful in. Cyro is ridiculously powerful. The Oz kits don’t change anything, and changing Oz kits doesn't change movement.\n\nThere's so many invisible walls it'll drive you insane. So many fake rocks you'll die while trying to jump on them.\n\nTHEY COPY AND PASTE SIDE-QUESTS. There is literally a quest that has the same character, same horde-mode style gameplay, and SAME FREAKING DIALOG. What a joke, how lazy can you get?\n\nLoot:I found an Oz kit at level 3 which I still use at level 31 – it heals you when you pick up O2 canisters, so I’ve never had to heal, ever. Practically every enemy drops an O2 canister. The series has never been about balance, but seriously? Weapons given through quests are uninspired. The progression of loot is slow – you’ll still be playing with the same basic ones throughout your first play-through.\n\nAnd that’s where I stopped. One play-through was more than enough for me, thank goodness I didn’t spend $30 on a season pass, especially being shafted for $80 USD.\n\nTL;DRWhat a step down in quality. This writing can f*** right off. Take all the fake Australian colloquialisms, gibberish and shove it. I feel like I need a shower after all this crap.\n\n\n4/10\n(updated the score from a 3 to a 4. It functions, but for a game that the same requirements as BL2, same engine, same everything, I find it hard to accept the numerous bugs.)","November 1, 2014","false","31.1"," 358 of 571 people (63%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","63","358","571","7","12"

First thing you notice is that there is less time spent exploring - probably because of your ability to freakin' fly. Maybe it's the lack of content?\n2. Second is the difficulty - the Pre-Sequel seems much easier. Be it enemies that miss you from arms distance, or your overpowered slam damage, etc... it just seems and is easier than Borderlands 2. (less tactics)\n3. It still has that great humor as the previous game - it makes me laugh, it's true to it's predecessor in this aspect.\n4. Graphics, Performance - I'm not an expert but i noticed the Pre-Sequel works a bit better on my PC than Borderlands 2. Could be many reasons..\n5. The Game is shorter than Borderlands 2 - and i'm not including the DLCs. It just seems freakin' short. It took me little time and I finished every mission and explored everything (at lvl 30). The DLCs for the Pre-Sequel so far are ♥♥♥♥, but hopefully they will add some story content soon instead of just new characters and arenas. Where is my Dragon Keep-like DLC??\n6. Playable Characters - I like them! And their skills. I had fun so far playing Nisha, Athena and Claptrap. All of them are a unique style of play.\n7. New possibilities, and old ones that are missing - I love the Grinder, it's usefull, expecially if you don't need to sell stuff anymore. But i miss the target practice, I wish they would bring it back in some form! It is so much easier to test a weapon on a target in the city.\n8. Price - It is overpriced for the experience you get. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the game but it's just not worth 60$. It offers less than Borderlands 2 in many aspects.\n9. Overall rating - I really enjoyed playing it despite it's flaws, and I recommend the game to anyone who liked Borderlands 2. But, better wait for the price to be more reasonable (on sale f.e.), because you don't get the experience you paid for. It's an important and interesting part of the Borderlands story, so it would be a shame to miss out on it. Just, don't expect too much from it and certanly don't pay too much for it. Even though it seems like a franchise rip-off, it is enjoyable and interesting.\n\nThanks for reading, hope this helps.","February 3, 2015","true","121.1"," 49 of 65 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","49","65","0","0"

And this game has a ton of content.\n\nFirst of all, let me start with one thing. This game is surprsingly DARK compared to the last two Borderlands games. Prepare your morality.\n\nNow that that's done, let's carry on.\n\nPROS\n\n+Borderlands The Pre-Sequel does not disappoint. I have to admit, at first I was super worried about dying of oxygen loss, but the devs were able to make it so losing your oxygen doesn't really make you worry. Oxygen is every where, and if you DO run out, your health depleted at around less than 1% per second, so it isn't a threat to you at all.\n\n+The low gravity also helps a lot. The use of buttslams makes it more fun to flank enemies, and makes the combat even more fast-paced. Slams also work in places with oxygen, as long as the area doesn't have aritifcial gravity. This also helps for easy second winds. If you were to jump accross the area, and get shot down, chances are you'll land right close to another bunch of enemies. This gives you an indirect and accidental edge against enemies, which is also good. Additonally, certain oz-kits can make your low-g experience more fun and fluid, I personally use the air control ones.\n\n+Now about lasers, one of the most advertised parts of the game. Let me put this straight, they're awesome, and really powerful. They also act as psuedo-gun types for each brand. You want Dahl Shotguns back? Have A LASER ONE THAT FIRES AROUND 3 LASER BOLTS PER SECOND. There are also different types such as the railguns, beams, and repeaters, but different manufacturers can give each weapon type an edge due to their special attributes.\n\n+Cryo weapons are also fun, and not just in the visual kind of appeal. It's more tactical than slag. Slag was just like "shoot enemies with this and then hit them with this". It even stole corossion's power, which made it even crappier. But cryo is super fun to use. The simple charm of butt stomping a single enemy ( EVEN MORE FUN WITH A TEAM) just puts a smile on my face.\n\nAlso, A LOT OF  unique weapons with red text can compete with legendary weapons. Like AN EXPLOSIVE JAKOBS SHOTGUN.\n\nNow we have the CONS. Every game has them.\n\n-Let's start with a really annoying one, the checkpoints aren't kind. The maps are bigger for verticality purposes, but some checkpoints can be too far enough that they end up stingy and unforgiving.\n\n-Next, the vehicles. While the stingray is a pretty fun vehicle to use, I can't help but feel disappointed in the lack of variety. The moon buggy is okay at best, although it's more of the same with classic Borderlands vehicles.\n\n-Nisha's whip is terrible, unless you get the Law and Order skill tree capstone. Don't expect to melee a lot with her.\n\n-The side missions are the same with past missions, where you have to go and kill the thing while getting the other thing. Personally, I don't mind this since Pre-Sequel has the best combat in a Borderlands game so far, but other people might not.\n\n...Overall, Borderlands TPS is a great time. Unless your emotions will get the better of you SINCE THIS GAME IS PRETTY DARK.\n\nAn 8 out of 10.","October 13, 2014","true","256.7"," 504 of 827 people (61%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","61","504","827","5","20"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CptCritz/recommended/261640/","CptCritz","Critz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CptCritz/","75 products in account","Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel:\nSo far I have enjoyed this game and have completed the entire campaign on both normal and true vault hunter mode for every single character. I have also done 80% of side missions for every character and have farmed for almost every single farmable legendary.\n\nOne of the most common questions asked about this game is "Is this game all just a big DLC?" and the answer to that question is yes. All of the menus , weapon brand names and also certain legendary weapons from the previous Borderlands game have been used here. The games campaign and all side quests will give you around 18 hours of solid gameplay. You will then have the choice to enter true vault hunter mode which strengthens enemies and bosses etc. There is also the farming side of the game with many legendaries to find.\n\nNew Additions:\nBorderlands: The Pre-Sequel have added some extras too. The oxygen system is new to the series which means you can only survive in space with an "Oz Kit" Oz kits allow you to perform a ground slam and also to breathe. Oxygen in the Oz kit also depletes the more you are outside an oxygen bubble. This whole mechanic never seems to be a problem and oxygen isnt scarse or isnt hard to find. Enemies have about an 80% chance of dropping on oxygen tank to fill up your Oz Kit.\n\nAnother small edition to this game is the Grinder. The Grinder is found in "Concordia" (The equivalent to Sanctuary in Borderlands 2). This allows players to grind 3 of their unwanted weapons (Usually the same quality) and gives them 1 weapon of a higher quality. This is a great addition to the game as it allows players who may not want to farm to try their luck on the grinder. I have grinded for legendaries many times and have saved a lot of time looking for the legendaries myself.\n\nNew Characters:\nThe new characters in this game are very unique all in their own ways. All of their skill trees are very in depth and all do different things depending on which skill tree you choose to route for. These characters however do not go together as well as the previous characters from Borderlands 2 as all of their skills dont exactly fit together. Almost every single character you can choose from fits into the story well and you can see how they got into the state they were in Borderlands 2.\n\nSetbacks:\nAlthough the game has a lot of good things there is always going to be something bad about a game. First of all the AI are exactly the same as the AI from Borderlands 2 which arent exactly the best. Ive seen AI run into walls, jump off the map and just generally being idiotic. Maybe they could update the AI in some sort of patch? I dont know probably not.\n\nThe driving in this game is also quite a struggle if you're new to the franchise, especially the new stingray vehicle.  Moving your mouse to change direction takes the vehicle a lot of time to realise and has often made me fall off the map multiple times.\n\nGetting a weapon you want at the start of the game is also quite a challenge. There are many vending machines placed around the map at the start but getting a weapon from one costs money (The money you dont have). On my playthrough Ive spawned with some sort of SMG whereas my friends have spawned with shotguns and snipers. This random weapon is selected based on what character you choose which in my opinion should be changed.\n\nSummary:\nOverall I think this game is a well developed and well set out game for either long time fans are new players. I highly recommend this to people who enjoy playing RPG games with friends and like to farm and collect certain items. I also recommend buying the season pass as from the past Borderlands game we were given way more than what we payed for. This game is 100% worth the £30 it costs and I highly recommend you take a look at this game!\nOverall Rating - 9/10","October 20, 2014","true","106.2"," 208 of 333 people (62%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","62","208","333","8","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AngryBoz68/recommended/261640/","AngryBoz68","AngryBoz68","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AngryBoz68/","377 products in account","Developed by 2K Australia in cooperation with Gearbox, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel! fills the gap between Borderlands and Borderlands 2 by taking the player to Pandora's moon Elpis and telling the story of Handsome Jack's rise from lowly software developer to CEO of Hyperion and his transformation from being a somewhat likeable jerk trying to save Pandora's moon into a complete jerkwad.\n\nPlayers of Borderlands 2 will feel right at home as the Pre-Sequel uses the same engine and interface as Borderlands 2.  This can give an impression that the game is more of the same and those impressions would not be entirely incorrect.  The Pre-Sequel does a lot of things safely and does not attempt to stray too far from the traditional Borderlands formula of rediculous humor, face-shooting action and lots of loot.  Along with a shortened experience, this makes the impression of a very long expansion pack for Borderlands 2.\n\nEven with the similarities, the game does offer quite a bit of new content and features to the Borderlands experience:\n\nWe get a new story which details the events between Borderlands and Borderlands 2 and get to see Jack transform from a fairly likeable guy to a complete jerk by the end.  The story plays on moral ambiguity and veterans of the franchise may find themselves actually having a liking of the "villains" and a despising of the "heroes" from the other games.  The story definitely plays on matters of morality and perspective that can have the players questioning who are the true heroes of the series.  Voicing for many of the moon's inhabitants is done from an Australian perspective which makes the environment feel like a "Land Up Over" Pandora.  There is a lot of Australian humor embedded in the game, especially in the various side-quests which can be a plus or minus depending on whether one "gets" the jokes.  The ending of the main story was a tad perplexing but was a clear setup for the events coming in Borderlands 3.\n\nThere are 4 new vault hunters in the Pre-Sequel and they are all characters which fans of the franchise will recognize.  Claptrap is finally a playable character and his skill tree is very unpredictable and fun in a Claptrap sort of way!  Wilhelm the Enforcer has a pair of drones named Wolf and Saint which provide a balance of offensive and defensive capabilities.  Wilhelm also has a cybernetic tree which actually changes the character's appearance and voice based on the selected abilities.  Athena the Gladiator is a bit of a tankish class with a shield that can absorb attacks and be thrown at enemies.  Nisha the Lawbringer has a gunslinging capability that works much like an aimbot and grants a lot of weapon buffs.  In addition, the player characters are now fully voiced and have a part in regular conversation with NPCs outside of combat which is a very nice change.\n\nNew weapon types have also made it into the game.  Cryo weapons replace slag from Borderlands 2 and you can now freeze (and shatter) your opponents.  Laser weapons are also included and are a replacement for e-tech weapons from Borderlands 2.  Lasers come in different elements and varieties like bolts, beams and continuous beams.  I found the continuous beams to be especially powerful effects and favored those weapons.  Lasers generally come with an incidiary elemental type, but could also less-frequently take the form of other elements. In addition to the new weapon types, an upgrade system in the form of a grinder permits the player to discard 3 weapons in an effort to get a single weapon of better quality or attributes.  This grinder requires some experimentation to determine which recipe of discarded weapons are required for a desired outcome and will probably appeal to those who like to experiment and tinker in-game.\n\nThe low-gravity environment on the moon is perhaps the biggest feature change to make it into the game.  The low-gravity environment extends jumping greatly and gives the game a more vertical combat mechanic.  Artifacts are now replaced with O2 kits which supply the characters with oxygen on the moon's surface.  This adds an O2 management feature to the game where the player needs to be mindful of O2 levels to avoid suffocation, but some of that O2 can be sacrificed to allow for extended double-jumps and the ability to do a ground slam attack which will damage enemies in a radius.  Overall this feature felt pretty good and oxygen management was not too much of a burden as there were plenty of places to refresh the player's oxygen supplies before they ran out.  Players who do not want to worry about suffocation can play as Claptrap, who does not need to breath, but can still equip an O2 kit for the advantages of double-jumps and ground slam attacks.\n\nThere are some interesting changes that appear to have made it into the game at the requests of fans.  The enemies appear to scale more gradually than they did in Borderlands 2 which helps with difficulty spikes between playthroughs of the game.  Another benefit is that vending machines now finally scale to the player's level!  More frequent legendary drops and legendary gear in the vendors should be a welcome change for many.  Also, the appearance of more legendary gear in the vendors has a side benefit of actually making money important again.  Many of these changes harks back to the days of the original borderlands and reverts back some of the less popular changes that made it into Borderlands 2.\n\nThere are a few annoying items that I experienced while playing the game:\n\nVeterans of Borderlands 2 will notice the lack of a couple of features in the Pre-Sequel, most notably the ability to do a reset of mission progress as well as the ability to reset challenge progress.  I personally find these omissions confusing since they were already part of Borderlands 2 and the inclusion of those features do much to extend replayability of the game.  I only hope that these features will be added into the game via a future patch.\n\nAnother annoyance is that the raid boss is an upscaled version of the same boss that was encountered at the end of the main story.  This feels like a pretty lazy raid encounter and I am hoping that more creative raid content will be included with future updates.\n\nI did find a few bugs during my first playthrough of the game.  I had a crash to desktop at character creation of all things, though I could not reproduce that crash and did not experience any others during the course of the game.  There are some small graphical issues like clipping and some of the laser effects remaining on the screen when they should have long dissapeared.  There was a door to the first boss that would not open for me since it was waiting for other players, but I was running solo at that time.  I was able to get the door to open by simply backing away and reapproaching the door, so there appears to be a slight glitch with that as well.  Other than the single crash I did not experience\nanything completely game-breaking.\n\nOverall the game is a competent, although brief, entry in the Borderlands franchise.  Fans of the series may have a feeling that the Pre-Sequel is much-of-the-same and does not offer enough to warrant the $60 price of entry.  DLC and content patches may help fill in the gaps where the game is lacking, but I am not one that approves of the practice of using post-release DLC to fix issues with the release version of a game.  The game is definitely worth a look for existing fans of the franchise, though I would recommend getting it during a sale if possible.","October 29, 2014","true","98.3"," 180 of 288 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","180","288","4","6"

If you haven't played Borderlands 2 yet, play that instead. It's cheaper, just as fun, and more polished.\n\nThere's some over the top characters that just aren't funny, and the game just tries too hard at some points. For example, Torgue was funny the first time you met him. He's loud, obnoxious, and down right insane. But when he make regular appearances, it stops being funny. I already had my fill of him after his DLC, and yet they kept bringing him back. Over, and over, and over. And then of course there's characters like Pickle. He's just annoying. That's all I can really say about him. I'm not sure what they were thinking when making some of these characters.\n\nThe writing is also a bit worse. I get that they had to link Borderlands 1 and 2 together, and they did that pretty well, but the main bad guy is just poorly made. Jack was a good enemy because he made you want to hate him. This time, you get some other character who's constantly trying to reason with you and act sympathetic.\n\nAnd then of course there's the lack of end game content. Most bosses don't respawn, so you can't farm them for their legendaries. And even though this is almost an exact clone of Borderlands 2, the level cap has been reset to 50 (<--- has been fixed after a recent update) and overpower levels are nowhere to be seen. Making a sequel with the same engine and assets as the last game is fine as long as you move forward, but what they've done is take some things out and add some other things instead. It's not a step forward, it's a step sideways.\n\nSo would I recommend it? Unless you're a huge fan of the series, no. Wait for it to come down in price, because it mostly feels like an expansion. A very big expansion, but an expansion nonetheless. I say that as someone who already put a lot of time into the game. I don't mean to sound like I'm hating on the game. I'm just trying to be honest. This isn't for everyone, and unless you've played Borderlands 1 and 2, you're going to miss a lot of things. And unless you just can't wait for more, then the small changes aren't going to be enough. Pick it up on sale for $20 or so if you're not dying for more.","November 1, 2014","false","118.5"," 219 of 355 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","219","355","0","1"

While a few things were quite well done, particularly class design, bugs were a much bigger problem than in previous installments of the series, and gameplay suffered in multiple ways.

Fortunately, all the reloading that comes with resetting a zone will introduce you to the best gameplay mechanic to farm legendary items: the vending machine.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HotPartyAction/recommended/261640/","HotPartyAction","Don't","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HotPartyAction/","107 products in account","This is an early impression review.\n\nI'm 6 hours into the game and rather disappointed. I've played the dickens out of Borderlands 2, so when Borderlands: The Pre-sequel went on sale for $20, I decided to finally take the plunge.\n\nCons:\n\nPolitical correctness and censored vulgarity seem to be the new order of the day. Mr. Torgue's censored speech was always good fun in the previous game but now all characters eschew bad language in odd ways. Darn, dang, etc. It rings hollow. It seems like Gearbox and 2K were trying to make this more family friendly in the hopes of turning Borderlands into a wider media property and in doing so betrayed a portion of the game's heart which had previously made the game stupidly fun. You fail when you need to preach at and brow beat your audience into submission rather than presenting a multi-dimensional situation which allows the player to decide what, if any aspect, is right.\n\nWriting & voice acting are limp and seemingly inept thus far. These areas were always great in previous incarnations yet they are amazingly bland in this game. I know the actors can deliver great performances, as we've all heard before, but they seem to have been given terrible or careless direction when performing, then again, they weren't given much to work with from what I've heard so far. Some characterizations seem to have entirely changed. Moxxi isn't flirty, she seems annoyed or disinterested in everything at best, etc.\n\nHumor, or lack thereof. This goes to the previous points, writing, voice acting, and characterization. I don't need meme-laden reference humor all the time, and that is absolutely in here, but there doesn't feel like there is any meat here. The wit, zing, and bite of the previous jokes are gone. We're left with something barely tepid.\n\nThe game engine is virtually the same, not that I expected them to overhaul the entire thing but there isn't much in the way of new visual wizz bang doohickeys.\n\nItems, including moon rocks, seem to disappear entirely. I'm not sure if this is a bug or a "feature". In BL2, items seemed to stay put until you got round to collecting them. Items do disappear from crates you've opened, if they are vented into the vaccum of space. Also, be prepared to lose a lot of items when killing bad guys, especially when they're flying over the inummerable areas you can't get to unless you want to instakill yourself.\n\nThe moon buggy is horrid to drive. Get ready to repeatedly kill yourself when trying to make some radical jumps, dude. :P I'd compared it to Mass Effect's Mako, but at least the Mako could jump over obstacles properly.\n\nOxygen as a constantly depleting vital resource, it's annoying. There are many chances to get the O2 you need to survive but this is an aspect of games that I personally hate. It limits exploration and that may be intentional due to lack of game content.\n\nSeemingly less content overall. The hard disk footprint is about 6GB smaller than BL2, that's with all DLC for both installed. Some have complained about the story, I assume length is a major factor, I'm not far enough to judge that or narrative.\n\n\nPros:\n\nThe music is pretty great.\n\nSome grindy challenges seem to have been done away with, finding vault symbols, collecting all echo recorders in odd locations, etc. I could be wrong as I'm not too far into the game but it seems slightly less grindy in this area.\n\nMoon rocks seem more plentiful than eridium was, thus slightly less grinding.\n\nThat's about it so far.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThere is no polish to be found here. Borderlands: The Pre-sequel is little more than a quick buck cash grab, or so it seems at this early juncture. Add a new location, and a couple new elements, then mix it up with all the old BL2 concepts, reskin it, and they have a "new" game. They had a hit with BL2 and tried to remake it as fast as they could for another win on the scoreboard, it didn't work too well.\n\nThis would have been more fitting as a large expansion pack for BL2. DLC outside of the Season Pass, for that game.\n\nIt seems like reheated cafeteria food. You can eat it but I'm not sure anyone is salivating for it.","January 30","false","46.5"," 50 of 71 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","50","71","3","0"

Now, however, I no longer feel the same way.\n\nI can no longer recommend this game, especially for those who are looking to play borderlands for the first time.\nIt would definintely be better for players new to the series to start off with borderlands 1 or 2, essentially buy borderlands TPS if you are in search of additional, yet not up to par, borderlands content.\n\nI rate this game 5/10.\n\nIn comparison to past borderlands, this game seems less innovative, less memorable, predictable and drawn out at times, and more difficult (in an annoying sense, not as a fun challenge).\n\nMuch of this post will be negative, so I will quickly mention that if you have enjoyed borderlands 2, this game is very similar and will probably satisfy your basic needs for new borderlands content much as it did for me. However, IMHO, it is definitely not worth the 60$.\n\nBorderlands TPS truly seems like a lengthy DLC, at times, one that is lengthy and boring. Although the game itself is not long, the story appears to offer very basic objectives that are then drawn out by some other event in the game. (I.e. much of the game is straightforward yet suddenly an obstacle occurs to prevent one from completing the objective and therefore a new lengthier path must be taken to perform the simply objective).\nAdditionally, this game has proven to be, at least for me, that hardest of the borderlands so far.\nNot only have I found it harder to aquire a weapon that I like, but I also find that the weapons and characters are generally weaker than the enemies or that the enemies in this game are very strong. As another reviewer put it, often you will have to backtrack to former areas and complete quests that do not offer as much exp as they should or spend an hour grinding just to level up and be able to continue with the story quest. This is extremely prevalent in playthrough 2. In fact, the quest exp in playthrough 2 is horrendously bad.\n\nAgain, the story seems boring and forgetable.\nThe most dissapointing thing I've found, however, has been the 'raid boss' at the end of the game. Without spoiling anything, the raid boss essentially shows VERY minimal effort and is overall a huge dissapointment. If you thought, like me, you were going to (at least if the story was boring much like it is) quickly boost through the game and enjoy thinking of ways on how to beat an impossible raid boss, you will be deeply dissapointed.\n\nI can no longer recommend this game, at least not until the DLC comes out. I hope the DLC in this borderlands can come to offer more than the initial game. I plan to complete playthrough 2 and will add more as I see fit. Thanks for reading.\n\n--------------------------------------------------Additional findings------------------------------------------------------------\nPros:\n\n\n\nCons: Ammo seems to be very sparce when it comes to those seeking to use a single weapon type. For example, ammo chests that are supposed to carry 6 different stacks of ammo will usually be filled with only 3, generally of the kind you do not need. No longer to chests seem to prioritize ammo the player is drastically low on like in borderlands 2. Additionally, ammo is EXPENSIVE in the machine.\nFor example, weapons, at my level,  will sell for 1,000--2,000$ in a vending machine.\nTo fill my laser gun, I need to spend $15,692. As laser guns burn through ammo very quickly I am finding it difficult to sustain use of one of the few guns I have enjoyed using in the game so far.","October 14, 2014","false","58.6"," 174 of 288 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","174","288","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abnormalvisions/recommended/261640/","abnormalvisions","Abnormal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abnormalvisions/","153 products in account","Ok, i want to say, i REALLY wanted to like this game. I even spent a long time trying to convince myself it was good, or worth the 60 dollars. But it's just not. It's worth 20-30 dollars, not 60. Here's why. It's a bit of a rant, but I think its' better than the "OMG BORDERLANDS OMG GUNS BUY" reviews with 1,4 hours played.\n\nThe graphics and guns are exactly the same as borderlands 2. No improvements at all. The gameplay is basically the same too, except they added "oxygen," a new consumable resource. Instead of being fun, however, this basically turns into you standing on top of a vent once every 2 minutes for a few seconds. That's it. Basically, you just have to arbitrarily run to the nearest one to recharge, then go back to what you were doing. It doesnt ADD anything from a gameplay standpoint, it just makes you have to do a pointless backtrack.\n\nThe maps are at best poorly designed. I've never fallen off a map to my death so many times. And it's not because it's challenging or fun. It's because the damn things were obviously not gameplay tested. Ive gone off lifts that just killed me. You can't control anything when you're on a lift, but i still got thrown to my death. I've gone off ramps 4-5 times before i successfully completed the jump. This isn't fun, its brain damage.\n\nSimilarly, the AI is terrible, and the balancing is way off. They all stand around like morons, but when they actually do shoot you, you die nearly instantly. The boss fights are forced, and don't fit in with the storyline (which IS good.)\n\nFinally, I've yet to find a single weapon that's fun to use. Either it sucks, or it burns through tons of ammo and you're constantly out of ammo. No legends, no "cool" effects. Just balancing going out of ammo with doing damage.\n\nAnd worst of all is the bugs and the lack of save points and fast travel stations. I include this in one paragraph because they all group together to just be FRUSTRATING. So, at least 3 times i've had to reload because i just had a bug. One time, i couldn't move. I had to restart my computer. Another time, my special attack glitched and my crosshairs got stuck on the bottom left of my screen (wtf??). Another time my gladiator shield just stayed up forever so i couldn't see. This kind of thing is extremely common. I've been caught in invisible walls at least 3 times, and just had to reload. This is already annoying. But there's NO DAMN SAVE POINTS. frequently, my having to reload means i have to do the ENTIRE LEVEL OVER. and since there's no fast travel stations (so far, i have THREE) you have to WALK the entire way. Accross that map, which - guess what? - TENDS TO HAVE YOU FALLING OFF.\n\nHere's an example which happened to me. I got the end of a level, it took about an hour. it was a very long level. In this level, i fell off the map twice. whatever. I finally reach the room before the boss level. This is full of vague descriptions like "shut off the valve" This room has 4-5 levels, and the objective is not clearly marked. After about 15 minutes of frustratingly running in circles, i realize its ABOVE me, even though there's no reason for it to be there - there's not even a floor there, etc. And it's tiny, and it blends in. Whatever. I try to jump up there -- and get stuck inside an invisible wall. Reload the map, have to do the ENTIRE LEVEL over. all the enemies have respawned. Another hour, another 3 deaths falling off the map. This game isn't fun, its frustrating.\n\nAll in all, this game just isn't worth the 60 dollars. It's worth 20 dollars on sale, sure. You can have fun playing it. You can play with friends. And hey, if you like borderlands 2, you'll probably like this game too! Buuuuut...it's just not worth 60 dollars. Wait until it goes on sale for 20-30 dollars, then try it. Maybe by then they'll patch some bugs, too.","October 15, 2014","false","20.4"," 579 of 991 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","579","991","0","23"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Feenris/recommended/261640/","Feenris","Feenris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Feenris/","482 products in account","Note: if you are new to the series, get Borderlands 2 as it offers much more than this installment. Read review for more information.\nJust a couple of months ago i decided to get Borderlands 2 on the steam summer sale after hearing much of its critical acclaim; being one of the most fun multiplayer game to have graced our generation. Such is true, and it is only one of the many reasons what makes it a very great game. Very quickly, I fell in love with the game.\n\nAfter it ran out of content for me, I turned my head towards the series' next installment; The Pre-Sequel. Naturally since i was extremely into BL2 I pre-purchased a copy of TPS right away.\n\nNow, TPS runs the exact same engine as BL2 so much of its banes and boons are similar to it. This review will essentially compare TPS to BL2.\n\nOne of the main selling points that has been heavily advertised in TPS's trailers is the setting that is Elpis, Pandora's moon, has zero gravity and oxygen (aka vacuum). This leads to the game incorporating a couple of new gameplay elements; zero gravity jumps, oxygen kits and butt-slamming.\n\nZero gravity jumps are pretty self explanatory, when you are in vacuum you will jump higher than you would in atmosphere. It also feels more 'floaty' and movement midair is much slower.\n\nOxygen kits, or dubbed in-game as oz kits, are also pretty self explanatory, you need them for travelling in vacuum. As you travel in vacuum, the amount of oxygen of your equipped kit slowly depletes over time and if it reaches zero it will eventually inflict a DOT(damage over time) unto you, so it is important to always keep your oxygen levels up. There are also other ways to consume your oxygen. Now in TPS you could sacrifice your oxygen to revive your multiplayer pals much quicker than reviving them conventionally. Another way to consume your oxygen is by double-jumping, which is yet another new gameplay element introduced in The Pre-Sequel.\n\nButt-Slamming is basically crouching when you are midair, once you hit the ground while crouching you deal an AOE(area of effect) damage which depends on the oz kit you have equipped and is also directly proportional to the height which you begun crouching midair(or if im wrong, then its basically the height you jumped before buttslamming).\n\nPersonally, I love these new game play elements. I am not an avid FPS gamer and by no means one with deadshot aim, so these unique mechanics move a step closer towards to being another 'unique' gameplay-oriented FPS which i just can't get enough of.\n\nSo other than the new gameplay stuff whats different about TPS? Have they fixed the issues that has been addressed for their 2 year old predecessor? No, not really.\n\nWhat really irked me in BL2 is the audio placement of the dialog amidst the mess when players go guns blazing, you could hardly hear the dialog. Also, dialog gets cut off way too often without us knowing that new dialog would be triggered after entering a certain area. Yes, this issue is still in TPS which really, really infuriating. Gearbox fix this already please.\n\nStory in TPS is good but by no means fantastic, as we all know it tells the story of BL2's famed, fantastic villain, Handsome Jack's rise to power. Development is as expected and there really isn't much of a 'wow' factor in it.\n\nElpis is a joy to be in with its vacuum and atmosphere setting but honestly there really isn't much else going for it compared to Pandora mainly because its size is way smaller. Different areas feel too similar and some segments are really a pain. There are some questionable level and quest design structures which really makes the game boring at one point.\n\nPacing in the game is also quite problematic in the game. The first few hours have extremely boring missions and little to no development of story. Thankfully, once TPS's pacing finds its grounds, it gets really exciting and fun.\n\nEDIT: I previously said that the difficulty of the game is nigh impossibly hard but after the recent update I will amend it. So turns out the newest update that was rolled out really 'balanced' the game and right now it kind of feels like TVHM (new game+) has really not as much difficulty as it did before, and that is a bad thing. Too much of its difficulty is abolished and now the game feels like an utter cakewalk. Hopefully Gearbox will address this issue and raise the difficulty higher. Also since it is guaranteed that UVHM (new game + +) is going to be rolled out with the latest DLC/update (i vaguely know about this so forgive me if i am wrong) perhaps it is then that the difficulty would be raised. During this DLC/update, i hope that the difficulty would be raised significantly but more importantly, it has to have a plausible difficulty curve unlike what i found to be an insane difficulty curve when entering TVHM before the 'balancing' update. Again, this talk about difficulty is fairly relative and I apologise if any of you find it otherwise.\n\nEverything else in TPS is simply the goodness of BL2, witty dialog (although alot feel kind of too reused), interesting characters, exciting loot, and of course, an unparalleled multiplayer experience.\n\nAll in all, BL:TPS is a great step towards the 'unique'-gameplay FPS genre with its new mechanics and has alot of what made BL2 great, but also thats what makes it feel all too similar. There is/are less content, pacing issues, familiar settings all over and tad overused humour which makes it feel alot more inferior than BL2 since TPS is asking for a full fledged price of 60 bucks. Like most have said; it is essentially a massive BL2 expansion and by no means does any better than BL2 as a standalone game. The price of the game as it is currently would only be justified by how much you loved its predecessor and so it is not recommended that you get this game until it goes on discount to say, 30 bucks. It is a step back from BL2 but objectively speaking, it is by no means a bad game.\n\n7.5/10","November 8, 2014","false","39.8"," 132 of 216 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","132","216","0","8"

It's gone from bazzilions of guns to about 5 from each manufacturer of each type, Pistols, Assault Rifles etc.  Alot of your guns will roll with identical stats if they are the same make/level/type.\n\nThe new mobs to fight are terribly underwhelming.  The ability of mobs to jump clear across the map and land behind you is just stupid.  Even unsuspecting foes will walk behind cover and stay there if you put your crosshairs on them.  Laser weapon are just a joke, your firing a beam weapon.  This is a ray of light.  Lasers produce NO kick, but these lasers kick like a bloody mule.  You can't hold your crosshairs on a target and incinerate them.  Pull the trigger and your weapon jumps 6 feet up to the right. 90% of the weapons in game are recycled weapons from Borderlands 2.  Only weapons that I can honestly say were new were the laser weapons, and they are pretty much useless.\n\nYour most powerful weapons in the game are still the Torgue weapons with added explosive damage.  They rip and shred the end boss faster than any other weapons in the game by about 75% faster kills.  Torgue weapons are cool and all, but try taking out the end bosses with a fire/cold/electric/corrosion set of guns and you are headed for one place.  OUT OF AMMO! Take in one Torgue Assault Rifle loaded with ammo and you will wipe the end bosses all six phases with one gun.\n\nThe quests are terribly tiresome.  Go here, get this, bring it back.  Or it's go here, kill this, come back.  That and the fact that many of the zones don't even allow you to ride the new vehicles.  You have to walk.  Many of the quests send you through areas where you have to dismount and walk (Pickle quests in particular).  That and the fact you can't speed the dialogue up.  You are forced to sit there and listen to there useless rants until they are done.  On my second playthrough, I found myself trying to headshot many of my allies, just because their dialogues were so lengthy and stupid.\n\nThis game is no borderlands 2 remake, it is a shadow of BL2.  Definately not worth the $60.  Playing it I kept wondering when it was going to get exciting, it never did.  The only fun quest really is the race event, that one is a hoot.  Then you get to off the punks Dad every time you revisit the zone.  That's fun.  He's an idiot, but it's still fun removing his ♥♥♥♥ from the future gene pool.\n\nLegendary drop rate appears to be about 2 to 3 every 1,000 kills.  Don't expect a huge range of legendaries to choose from, there's only like 50 or 60 guns, and 1 to 2 Class mods, maybe 10 shields (some of which you never want to use because they will kill you faster than any mobs ever will)  add in a couple of "oz" legendaries and that's all you are going to see.\n\nEndgame is totally underwhelming, the secret boss Iwajira is a bit of a joke.  Explosive weapons chew him to shreds in mere seconds.  3 to 4 clips from your Torgue assault rifle and he's worm bait.  If he does spawn a couple of little runts you have to kill them off fast or they climb the wall and go above world where you cannot hit them and thus the only way out will not spawn.  Your only option then is to reload.  Even killing "Raid Bosses" is no guarentee of a good loot drop.  You may have to kill them a dozen times or more to even see a legendary and even then theres a 70% chance it will be a stupid grenade mod.\n\nAs it sits now, there's maybe 200 to 300 guns in the game that get new affixes and damage as a player levels.  It's still the same gun, same model, same maker, just with level rated stats and maybe a new affix.  BL2's guns were nuts.  TONS of different guns.  Not so in this offering.\n\nGrinder is pointless really. It's cost to moonstone grind are just ridiculous.  Grind 3 greens to make a blue and get charged 70+ moonstones.  Save up your useless junk legendaries and grind 2 of them into 1 legendary of your gun class for 130 Moonstones.  Chances are, you will get a tediore weapon  with low damage and a elemental effect.\n\nGet used to your bullet passing through an enemy and doing no damage.  That and enemies all want to run/jump behind you.  (The jumping clear across the map gets old very fast.  So much for sniping.  Sure you'll get one, but the rest of his buddies instantly dive for cover or jump clear across the map and butt slam you taking out your shields)  As a sniper you may get the benefit of one shot from an amp shield, then mobs are set to jump at you and keep your shield from ever getting back to 100% untill they are all dead.  Get a shield that boosts explosive damage and use that.  Amp shields are pretty much a waste of time.\n\nMelee is a bit of a joke unless you use a frost based weapon.  Turn them into an ice cube and shatter them.  Mobs run in, take a couple of swings then run away and dodge behind cover.  Don't look for a Brick type toe to toe slug fest, you will be disappointed.  Many of the mobs will NEVER melee, they just keep back peddling faster than you can move and shooting your ♥♥♥ all the while.\n\nThat and while in combat mobs seem to have a sixth sense about when to dodge.  Pull the trigger on them at point blank range, but before the shot goes off miraculously they dodge out of the way, THEN the shot goes off.  This effect will happen several times every fight.  Between this and having mobs jumping 1,000 yards, bullets passing through enemies with no damage, gets annoying very fast.\n\nOnce again, this is not BL2, it's not even a good DLC for BL2.  It's bland, boring, unimaginative, characters lack all depth, story line is pointless and simple.  There's little or no comedy value.  It's just a "go nowhere do nothing" title.  Terribly terribly boring and monotonous. Almost no replayability, with the quests the way they are, it's more like work than fun.","October 30, 2014","false","147.8"," 133 of 219 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","133","219","0","0"

Quest items flying away, cars randomly flipping, getting thrown around for no reason, even that inventory glitch from the last game where it would highlight the item on the other side of the screen is here now. They made your characters actually talk to the NPCs now which is nice but it seems like they just kind of added it later in the development as an afterthought. Athena especially has really unnatural dialog. Oh and there's tons of lol funny memes XD XD.\n\nA lot of people are saying that the game just feels like an expansion. It definitely feels like a stand alone given the work they had to do to make the new world and dialog and everything but the reused assets are pretty glaring. We once again get the same old buggy with a reskin, though thankfully the turrets are new this time. The Hyperion ammo boxes from the last game are practically the only ones you'll see. The generic human enemy types are still the same with a reskin. Even the jokes are reused, like the medical vending machine run by someone else says "don't die you good for business." There's lots of other examples I can't think of off the top of my head.\n\nThe most obnoxuous part of the game is what the social justice warriors have done with it. Midgets have been renamed to "Lil people", Characters have to clarify that their jokes were sexist and that that's horrible. Hell the game has a profanity filter. Every curse word has to be bleeped out. If they were going for a T rating they might have an excuse for that but they got an M so there's no reason to filter out profanity like we're children. Oh and they ruined Moxxi.\n\nOverall if you're a die hard Borderlands fan and you're really, really desperate for new content then you'd probably like this but otherwise save your money and let Gearbox learn a lesson from this.","October 14, 2014","false","26.9"," 561 of 966 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","561","966","0","21"

It may be worth half the price, but that is still only half the asking price!  In addition, they intend to sell DLC on top of this DLC, making it a clear cash cow.  Perhaps it would be worth the money if this future DLC were a part of the package, but it is not.\n\nSeveral issues from Borderlands 2 are addressed, others left as-is, and new issue are introduced.  The content is nice, but not terribly deep --- similar to the Torgue or Tiny Tina DLCs.  The maps are, franky, proorly organised and oftentimes frustratingly buggy, with invisible walls more prevalent than past Borderlands experiences.  The side-quests are also horridly arranged, often having to reclear an area to get the mission, return to a second area you need to reclear to undertake the mission, then back fo the first location to, yup, reclear it again to turn in the mission!\n\nCryo replacing Slag makes for a more interesting mechanic and Lasers are an interesting new weapon, though I could take or leave them personally.  The new vault hunters are interesting and seem well designed.  The plot fills a few gaps from Borderlands 2 and has a few laughs, though the humour is definitely worse than Borderlands 2.

Yes.\nIs it a good Borderlands game? No.\n\nAs a huge fan of the Borderlands franchise, this is not the direction I want this series to go.\nYou see, this game is plagued by SJW propaganda, the humor is forced and not funny 99% of the time, the political correctness is awkward, censorship (ok that one might be because it was made in Australia), characters like Springs, Pickle, Bosun (no seriously, why are they in a Borderlands game).\n\nA lot of the time you can not progress with the story until you hear the entire dialogue or clear out all enemies, this makes speedruns and all playtrought other than the first one tedious.\n\nThe Season Pass is a huge dissapointment, they weasel word themselvs out of making 4 Campaign DLC's like for previous Borderlands titles, this time they were like "we promised you 4 DLC's, didn't say what kind of DLC's" so this lead instead of 4 campaign DLC's only to get 1 campaign, 2 characters, 1 useless arena.\n\nThere are some good things too, not gonna lie, the Cryo element is fantastic. The classes are well made too. Lasers are kinda like E-Tech from Borderlands 2, but with more variety.\n\nIt's pretty obvious this should've been a DLC for Borderlands 2, not a full priced game.\n\nGet it only if you played Borderlands 1 & 2 and still want more new content (and only when it's on sale).","December 6, 2015","false","142.6"," 193 of 325 people (59%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","59","193","325","22","28"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MoLMF/recommended/261640/","MoLMF","MoLMF","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MoLMF/","328 products in account","This game is a serious step back for the series.\n\nFirst, there is a near complete lack of difficulty. Obviously Borderlands 2 needed Ultimate Vault Hunter mode to be enjoyable, to not include that at launch for this game was a huge mistake. Normal mode and True Vault Hunter modes are complete wastes of time- they offer no challenge at all, other than possibly boring the player to death. In addition to a lack of difficulty, there exists almost no endgame to speak of at all.\n\nThere is less gun variety than there was in Borderlands 2.  In Borderlands 2, every manufacturer of a type of weapon had a legendary weapon for that type at launch. For example, Maliwan made pistols, so there was a legendary Maliwan pistol- the Thunderball Fist. This is not the case in Borderlands the Pre-Sequel. There is also a lesser number of total unique guns in general as well. Of the unique weapons that do exist, a great many of them are simply remakes of the Borderlands 2 variants, some of them retaining even the same names and skins.\n\nCharacter design has also taken a step back, in my opinion. This is debatable, of course, and would depend on your personal perceptions of each character from both games. However, I find Borderlands 2 character design to be much more diverse and fun to play than in the Pre-Sequel, and I would imagine a majority of people feel the same.\n\nThe campaign is shorter as a whole, but with a fairly interesting story. The dialog has become more “Social Justice Warrior” based though, as Anthony Burch’s head ascends further up his own rear. It’s almost as if you can smell his colon when playing the game. This is not to say the game is without its funny parts, however- they do still exist, albeit more rarely.\n\nMap design is perhaps the greatest regression in this game compared to its predecessor. Whereas Borderlands 2 has several great and replayable maps in the vanilla campaign, the Pre-Sequel has nothing I find worth playing for fun. Borderlands 2 had maps that drew players in just for the gameplay and scenarios they presented, the Pre-Sequel does not. Many maps are just plain irritating to even explore, feeling empty and dead. Gameplay is slower and enemies are less varied.\n\nThe game lacks SLI and Crossfire support. PhysX implementation is still horrible. It still runs off DX 9. It still lacks multicore and threading support, running less efficiently on AMD processors. Basically, it’s easy to see that this game was made to fit on the entirely obsolete Xbox 360 and PS3 and is lack luster tech wise as a result.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend this game to anyone at the moment, and it is a very big letdown. I have over 1500 hours in Borderlands 2, and am a huge fan of the series.","December 3, 2014","false","36.0"," 152 of 254 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","152","254","0","9"

The similarities with Batman Origins are striking.    Developed by 2K Games Australia in association with Gearbox while Origins was developed by Warner Bros. Games Montreal in association with Rocksteady.   While both games nailed their environments and lore true to their respective ancestors, the lack of polish and change in mechanics anoints each as a step down in their respective series.\n\nLike Warner Bros. Montreal screwing with Arkham City's pristine fighting mechanics,  the Borderlands revival mechanic FFYL or Fight for Your Life has been ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized by 2K Games Australia as demonstrated by the behavior of retreating and health regenerating A.I..  Imagine your FFYL health almost gone but another shot or two will get you revived.  LOL 2K Games Australia spits on you.  Watch as your last ditch resuscitation attempt becomes fruitless as the A.I. you've focused on for elimination regenerates all heath leaving you without hope.

Ship it, it's good enough!\n\nHow about being told to "activate" a Fast Travel station but only finding out after you've Fast Traveled to "town" that you can't get back.  Correction, you can get back but have to slog through multiple stages for 20 minutes running (jet packing) by the dumb bewildered A.I..   Once back only do you realize that you have to press the "activate button" for the stage to appear in the Fast Travel system.  I guess when I used the Fast Travel originally the system wasn't yet "activated".   Design that would get a laugh or two at any local comedy club by wasted patrons looking for a cheap laugh.   Hey did you hear the one about the Fast Travel system that you can travel but wasn't "activated" .......\n\nHow about getting blown off of a concentric ring adorning a space station by an A.I. construct.  No problem, I'll just jet pack back onto the ring since I have a jet pack.  2K Games Australia says no no no.  Immediate death for you because apparently that makes the game more fun!\n\nI've had enough.  2K Games Australia put up a valiant effort and I'm sure everyone poured their hearts and souls into this project but in the end they're not Gearbox.

Despite the previous sentence, there are a few big things with the writing that are going to cause me to give this a negative review.\n\n-The game WILL ACTUALLY LECTURE YOU on issues like friendzoning and why if you think this you are a dark, terrible misogynist. To see this, in the Light Reactor quest in the beginning of the game return the Light Reactor to Janie Springs. Torgue will come in with the friendzoning claim, and then he later interjects how he has seen the light and is a much better person now.\n-There are many homosexual queer characters (Which is great! More representation is better! All for that!), however the game will rub it in your face constantly that they are queer, as if this is their defining trait. We get it, they like the same gender as they are, stop pushing it in my face constantly.\n-Game is comparatively shorter, only being 11 Chapters which will take you about 15 hours to beat (including 95% of sidequests)\n-You will constantly have to find oxygen, as about 80% of the game is outside where there is no atmosphere (speaking of, how are they outside without any suits to protect against the cold? No real explanation for that).\n\nThere are also a few really awesome things I like about this Borderlands that should be included in all future games.\n-When doing quests, your character will actually hold a conversation with the quest giver (giving you more immersion as well as giving insight into the character's personality), and for me, this gives me a reason to play all the characters to hear what they all will say!\n-When doing a second playthrough (True Vault Hunter Mode or Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode), the game actually changes the dialog. The first playthrough is framed as Athena telling a Story to Lillith and company, and the Second playthrough is framed as Brick and Tiny Tina wanting to hear the story again, but more awesome. It makes a second playthrough feel much fresher.\n-The plot is pretty interesting, as it details Handsome Jack's descent from "Hero of Elpis" to "CEO Psychopath" in BL2.\n\nSo with all this in mind, buy if you want.

This game just feels like a chore. Its almost lifeless. I played the previous Borderlands games incessantly making multiple characters playing the same missions going to the same locations over and over while listening to podcasts and music and I loved it. I even bought multiple packs of DLC because I just couldn't get enough. What happened Gearbox?\n\nI should mention I've only ever played co-op once. I'm sort of the proverbial lone wolf in games like this as well as MMO's. Really anywhere I guess. So if you're super into anything co-op this does that.\n\nBut lets get to the crux shall we\nThe game feels inherently different than previous iterations. Its slower, but somehow manages to not be as methodical as the two ideas typically go hand in hand skipping down the street all the way up to the moonbase of Hyperion. Its just as chaotic as Borderlands has ever been but you move slower and have more meters to manage as being on the moon.. oxygen is helpful to our species well being. Because you're constantly monitoring your oxygen, while easy to refill, you to still HAVE to do it. Which makes exploring things outside on the surface this thing that now takes effort instead of just having the joy of discovering things.\n\nThe characters are all sort of what you expect from borderlands style of humor but somehow, maybe its the location, they manage to be completely innocuous, uninspired and uninteresting.

The new oxygen system doesn't provide anything to the game, it's only an annoyance and so is the low-gravity. Sure it's fun to float around for a while but not for the whole damn game. The moon makes me want to return to Pandora so bad. Also Claptrap's ultimate gives a random effect to the whole team and sometimes it's an annoying one like wasting all of the ammo for everyone.

Borderlands 2 was so much better. The missions in Pre-Sequel is not creative, unique and fun like they were in Borderlands 2. In this game it's a lot of running back and forth, pick up a thing and deliver it, go from point a to b and then back to a again. It becomes tedious and boring. The grinding parts are not fun. Pre-Sequel also feels more uptight than Borderlands 1 and 2. But I think that the space-themed setting is great and the graphics are beautiful.\n\nSadly, the story wasn't especially gripping or interesting. I hoped it would get more interesting the longer I played but no. They could have made Jack a bit more "likeable". Yes he is the bad guy but come on, give him a bit more depth. He feels one-sided and stereotypical. It's boring and predictable. I don't really see a reason as to why I should help him with his missions. I have played through the storyline as Nisha but she felt one-sided too. Where is the depth?\n\nIs it worth playing? Maybe. It got the same action-filled, hectic hyper-pace as the other Borderlands games. It's open world-ish and a fun co-op game. But I can't recommend it because the quests and story are meh and the characters feels flat.","October 23, 2015","false","50.8"," 46 of 70 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","46","70","2","0"

We play these games because shooting stuff is fun. We play these games because looting things is fun. Based on that alone, this game is great.\n\nLooking at the game as a whole, however, we basically have an over-priced, low-gravity Borderlands 2 expansion.\n\nPros:\n+ Shooting stuff.\n+ Players are addressed by name...sometimes.\n+ Player characters have dialogue. (Though Athena is like a robot...)\n\nCons:\n- The humour is realllllly lacking. They're trying way too hard, here. There are some moments you might get a chuckle out of, but for the most part the game isn't all that funny.\n- Players are still addressed as "Vault Hunter" from time to time, and quite often the game just always assumes you're in a group. (When playing single player, being addressed as a group of people just seems weird.)\n- The novelty of MOONPHYSICS wears off pretty quickly. It makes the entire game feel slower.\n- There is a LOT of backtracking.\n- Quality of loot is mostly awful.\n\nI want to say "there's a lot more to it", but there isn't.\n\nIf you love Borderlands, you'll find things to enjoy about this game, but wait for it to go on sale, and wait for some DLC to come out. As it is, $90 for the base game and future DLC is far too much to pay for what's there. $60 for Game+Season Pass would be far more reasonable.

The combat in this game is great, the low gravity and double jumping makes the combat (especially the boss fights) really cool. It also has the best selection of weapons ever in a borderlands game adding new laser weapons and overall better weapon aesthetics.\n\nThe bad part? It's poorly written. This game was made by 2k Australia so by extension it was written by Australians. Now I have nothing against Australians but because it was written by people from a different culture with different humour all the funny content from previous borderlands games seems to be replaced with a big inside joke which I'm not a part of. Even humour aside the story is dull and I find myself not caring about any of the characters and it seems neither do the devs because scripted dialog from other sources commonly cuts off the main story. The game quickly turns into a repetative cycle of go here kill this with the story progression and questing that feels straight out of an MMO.\n\nSo as far as gameplay goes, its pretty good.

You have a slot for an oxygen canister now, and when your oxygen runs out on the moon, you need to quickly find an airvent, or airlock to enter. Since there is oxygen every few feet, this really doesn't add difficulty to the game. However, the plus side to the no-oxygen atmosphere is the ability to jump high with the low gravity and slam back down to the ground, injuring enemies. You can also use oxygen to boost your floating in the air.\n\nThe game itself feels short, and so I think it should have been a $20 DLC---it is certainly not the quality or length of what we've come to expect from a Borderlands game. The world feels rather empty at times, the enemies repetitive, and there isn't much difficulty even to the bosses. They're just bullet-sponges.\n\nThere are humorous moments in the game, but not many. The characters are sadly forgettable (not that they can ever top Tiny Tina). There are what I presume to be pop culture references, but this game was made by 2K Australia and as an American player they were mostly lost on me.\n\nIf you haven't played the Borderlands 2 DLCs, I strongly STRONGLY recommend those over the Pre-sequel. They're the most fun you can find in the Borderlands series and won't set you back $60. Even on sale, I wouldn't purchase this game unless you're comfortable expecting it to be a sub-par continuation to the series.","December 21, 2014","false","22.2"," 57 of 90 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","57","90","0","0"

The writing and humor is a bit lacking compared to Borderlands 2 so far, but there is no argument that the formula works. The setting and locations are good, the music is notably less dubstep (good or bad depending on your tastes), and the new gun/elemental types are a fitting addition to the arsenal. The most interesting change for me is that your character has a voice now. Playing Nisha and hearing her interact with npcs adds a nice bit of immersion.\n\nThe combat itself makes it hard to ever play the previous titles again. It feels more dynamic and action-oriented. Less cover and more gliding through air to land a fiery buttstomp. The O2 mechanic isn't as stressful as I feared, although you can and will run out at times, It won't spell death. Many forms of refilling exist whether killing enemies or interacting with devices or air geysers. Plus there is nothing more rewarding than shooting an enemies helmet and watching him struggle and suffocate.\n\nThe loot looks great so far. I found a chest which required 40 moonstone which I paid and got 4 epics. I also found the famed Bonus Package grenade from BL2 at level 10 which is always welcome in my collection. I'm looking forward to testing out the grinder once I unlock it, but I think that will greatly affect how we view the loot. I hope there are a few raid bosses to farm at 50.

It's more like DLC to Bl2.\n2. It's not interesting. Shooting at enemies in, again, Bl2 is way more fun.\n3. No actually new enemies. Tork = Spiderant. Scav = Bandit. Dahl Lost Legion is the same Bandits or Hyperion Engineers. They just renamed pld ones.\n4. No new weapons. Yes, Laser are cool, but still all weapons are the same. Even Legendaries (Laser Leg do not count).\n5. They put too much hope on CL4P-TP (aka FR4G-TP). He isn't unique, as the've been saying.\n6. Short story line. It ends on level 25 (In Bl2 on level 30-31). And we don't have actual base. In Bl2 it's Sanctuary, where we taking most of the quests and buy ourselfs stuff. In Bl: Pre Sequel they tried to make Concordia as Sanctuary, buuut they pretty much failed. We don't have resons to go back there. Only for Black Market.

I pre-ordered it because I like 1 and 2 so much. That's a mistake I won't be repeating though. The game opens incredibly strong with a great hook in the form of its initial level, and then it opens up into the big wide world complete with vehicles and side quests and quirky characters.\n\nThis is the moment in the other Borderlands games and good open world RPGs when the game usually becomes awesome. But for The Pre-Sequel it's actually the reverse. This is when the game gets bad. The middle 80% is just...boring. The side quests are mostly simple fetch or kill affairs, with little to no importance related to the main story, and certainly requiring no real decisions or strategy to complete. And the bulk of the main story itself feels like a loosely tied together series of side quests.\n\nI found the new characters to be annoying to the point of turning the audio off and relying on subtitles (Pickle in particular). It just seems like the character design was much worse overall than the other Borderlands. And the writing in general was much worse. It wasn't funny. Most of the jokes were just dumb.\n\nMy single biggest complaint by far though is the leveling system. It was purposefully slowed down from Borderlands 2 to make the game take longer. And wow, it shows. You take longer to level, longer to get better loot. And because weapon quality is related to level it means that for most of your first play through that even just firing a gun is a challenge because you're more worried about controlling the huge amounts of spray than actually hitting anything. I was extremely frustrated by this reduced pacing at every turn.\n\nThe graphics also do not do well on a modern system. The engine is dated, and it shows.\n\nI went into this knowing it was milking the series, but I was still confident it would be that loud, crazy fun experience that the first two games were. There are glimpses of that bookending the game, but it's too little too late compared to all the exhausting hours in the middle.","January 16, 2015","false","39.3"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","23","30","0","1"

I've done almost all the quests that the game has to offer (bullet sponge raid bosses aside). I think at 60 hours, I'd done "most" of the content in Borderlands 2, a game which, for the same price, has more areas, more story, more quests, everything.\n\nIt's more Borderlands, yeah, but at $60 for a game that's less than half the size of its $60 predecessor, it's definitely a bit of a letdown. Likewise, most of the DLC is about new characters rather than places to go.\n\nI will say that Athena herself is super fun to play as, the butt-slam mechanic is cool, and zero gravity exotifies the gameplay in a cool way. I enjoy the core of what's there, but the shooting mechanics haven't been improved from the previous games (and I personally think there's lots of room for improvement in terms of enemy feedback, etc).\n\nThen there's the writing. Pre-Sequel feels like a game with an agenda. I've never felt this way about the series before, but some complaints from one of the writers about how people clearly didn't like a character because of her sexuality or her being a girl, combined with some other stuff in the game, has me feeling a bit off.\n\nPersonally, I feel that the character in question is a bad character--she constantly badgers the player for attention, yet the game provides no way for the player to give that attention, giving impression that, within the narrative, the player char doesn't WANT to give it. More importantly, a well-liked and trusted NPC from previous games, Moxxi, constantly treats the character with derision and annoyance, confirming for the players that yes, this is a character who engages in unhealthy sexual harassment.\n\nThat on its own would just be a weird disconnect between the game's author and its audience. But the game takes it further.\n\nMost of the insane mission givers in the game are men. Scratch that, I think it's all of them. Whether it's a guy who blows himself up or a guy who wants to kill his wife or a guy who enslaves a female computer 'cause he can't get any, the men of The Pre-Sequel are generally crazy and bad. The only male playable character at launch is a man so obsessed with machines that he becomes one. So the characters the game launched with two white women and two robots.\n\nTPS' women fare much better: it's the female computer who rolls her eyes at the men in the game, heck, if I remember right, she's the character who makes the stereotypically huffy "men" comments in TPS. The villain, Zarpedon, is the most sympathetic in the series--she is doing something we try to stop, but she's doing it to save the universe. She also wants to pay for her daughter's health. We're the bad guys. The woman trying to rid herself of her psychotic husband apparently runs a gang and, like Zarpedon, runs this gang with matriarchal efficiency.\n\nAnd this could all be accident, but it feels like agenda, and one that downplays equality in favor of the "women are wonderful" effect--the idea that women are great and can do little, if any wrong, and men all suck in comparison to them. This game feels as if it disrespects women because it feels the need to put men down, rather than let the women stand on their own. Like... it feels as if the game thinks women aren't good enough to stand up against great male characters, so it has to tip the scales in the women's favor by giving us really crappy men instead.\n\nBorderlands: The Pre-Sequel fails to give us any equality, and in doing so, ends up treating everyone like crap. Women with disingenuity, men as targets of aggression.\n\nLiterally the only "nutty" women I could think of were the ones who ran some silly "people's liberation army" thing. Borderlands 2 felt a lot more equal than this, with cool women as both psychotic villains and admirable allies.\n\nAt this point, I'd like to say "whatever, it's more Borderlands," but it's not even that. It's less Borderlands than you're used to. The tweaks feel like they'd be right at home in a DLC rather than something one might expect of a sequel. While I think they're vital additions to the game, I just wish I had a more substantial, better-written game to play than this. Definitely a disappointment.","January 26, 2015","false","29.8"," 114 of 195 people (58%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","58","114","195","12","14"

I really am. I really, REALLY, REEEEAAAAAAAAALLY wanted to like this game. Unfortunately, the game is just too bugged and feels too... boring.\n\nThe low gravity thing is a gimick and makes the game feel slow despite the fact there are low gravity boosters and whatnot. This is Borderlands. I don't play to go slow. I play to kill things mindlessly while mindless things die and drop loot. This mechanic brings out the worst aspects of the game and reveals what the Borderlands series really is; a grindfest. The oxygen management system is pointless and feels like more of a chore than it does a method of survival. The UI is the EXACT same as Borderlands 2, leaving me to wonder if this should have been a major DLC update or not.\n\nOh, and don't get me started on the AI. The AI is just horrible. Too many times have I seen enemies just face eachother while I shoot them. Too many times have I seen them run RIGHT PAST ME while I shoot at them. Again, I have played the game for 3 HOURS while writing this review and so far I have seen so much wrong with the game.\n\nAgain, I need to stress that I LOVED the second one. I thought the second Borderlands fixed a lot of issues the first one had.\n\nAs for bugs, I have run into countless nonsense bugs, like quests not starting, quests not triggering unless I do something very specific (for example having to leave the bullet and reenter it despite the fact I was already on the quest marker in the beginning of the game). There were DOZENS of moments where this happened... IN 3 HOURS OF GAMEPLAY! There are graphical issues with the cut scenes, like the cut scenes having these strange lines and deviations throughout the scene.\n\nDriving just sucks. It is horrible. I dunno if there was a coding error or what but it's very difficult to drive in this game. You either don't turn sharply enough or you turn too sharply. It's difficult to gain acceleration so you will miss a lot of jumps. In fact, that's the main reason I've died while playing this game, my damn car wouldn't clear the jump despite the fact that I have done it before. The car just won't gain speed. At this point I just completely skip out on driving in this game.\n\nI will keep playing, because I feel like there might be something in here worth playing. However, for newcomers to the series, I say play Borderlands 2. Something needs to change. I am not sure what does, but something does. Skip this one until the issues have been fixed. Even after the issues have been fixed I'd still be weary.\n\nEDIT:\n\nSo playing 1 more hour and I've noticed even more bugs. Enemies will literally spawn right in front of you, more horrible AI, invisible walls everywhere, getting stuck in place while running... and just try to watch Jack while he's on an elevator. This game needs to be patched. I am shocked this game was released in the state it is in now.\n\nEDIT: STORY TIME (will post as I get them)!\n\nI may as well tell stories of the silly things I see. See this section for stories and things I see!\n-I just had a lunitic stand in front of me and attempt to butt slam me over and over again. I just stood there. I wish I had a capturing software. He did it for a good two minutes until I killed him.\n-Just saw a Badass Lil Skiv fight other bandits. Bandits didn't respond to it. Go little badass, go.\n-Walked up to a raider. He walked right past me. Never attacked me. Moved around him. Jumped all over. Shot next to him then he and all the other raiders engaged me.\n-Hate low gravity. Makes gathering loot a hastle. Kill a badass, everything goes flying everywhere and I need to spend more time than I should picking it all up.\n-Enemies really seem to hate Kraggons. Whenever there is one nearby, they all focus on them, despite the fact that they're jumping around and I'm shooting at them.\n-Just had an epic level item fall through the map. Yes. I'm mad. It was a pistol and I'm using pistols.\n-Shot a guy with a newly acquired rocket launcher in a low gravity room. His body went flying around at about 1000mph and then got stuck in a wall. Shortly after he flew to the other side of the room then went through the world.\n*MAY AS WELL PUT TIME AND DATES FOR THIS NONSENSE*\n-October 15, 2014 1520: Just fell through the world...\n-October 15, 2014 1530: Just realized that Tork Swarmlings (take about one shot to kill) grant 50% more exp than a Skav (takes about 5 shots to kill). BRB gonna farm some Torks.\n-October 15, 2014 1550: ...Just look at my screenshots... This AI...\n-October 18, 2014 2022: Your character talks too much and often makes no sense. For example, why is my character talking about looking at a map when I'm in the inventory? Why is my character talking about choosing skills when I'm looking at the map? Why won't my character just shut up?\n-October 18, 2014 2248: Walked in front of a soldier. He just walked right past me too. I guess they gave up...\n-October 18, 2014 2253: A Tork jumped through the wall then attacked me though that same wall then jumped out of the wall and attacked me again.\n-October 20, 2014 1152: There is a mission where you need to download AI into a loader. You need to defend it while it stays in place and downloads said AI. Well, the loader started to walk around after it was attacked. Then it was frozen by an Ice Marine. Now it's permanently stuck and it won't allow me to continue with the mission. Check out the screenshots.\n-October 20, 2014 1937: An invisible wall just killed me. Like I was jumping from platform to platform and then I just suddenly die. I didn't fall. I just straight up die.\n-October 20, 2014 2007: So I killed an enemy while I was down and I didn't come back to life.

I tried as hard as I have ever tried. As a huge fan of the Borderlands series, This game looked like the best thing to ever happen. I watched every ad with wide eyes, and preordered the second I was able to. I even bought the season pass, as Borderlands 2 more than delivered on its price for its season pass. When the Presequel finally came out, I had booked several days off worked, stocked up on food, and prepared to delve into another adventure into the borderlands universe. Barely an hour later I was standing away from my PC, shaking my head, and regretting my blindness.This game is bad. Not legendary 'bad', just bad. From gimmicky mechanics which interfere with your gameplay (Goodbye rare weapon headed for low orbit!), to ridiculously unintuitive level design (Because instant death pits immediately outside of vehicle spawns are fun, right?), to length padding of the worst kind (Hey, you got the thing! Now go get three more from the other corners of the map!). However, this isn't the worst part, not at all. Both previous games had their glitches and faults. However, what they did have was fun. Hours upon hours of childlike fun, especially Borderlands 2. Even the worst areas in the game (I'm looking at you Sawtooth cauldron, padding based level that you are!) are still enjoyable, although perhaps a bit tedious. This is where Borderlands: The Presequel fails. It simply is not FUN to play. Oh sure, it has interesting gimmicks, such as low gravity, Oz kits, Laser weapons, and plenty of eye candy, but this isn't what makes a game fun. A game is fun when its has honed gameplay mechanics, well designed levels, creative enemies, good music, enjoyable characters, and passable writing. The presequel has none of these.\n- The gameplay mechanics are pretty much ripped right from borderlands 2, icons and all, with virtually no change at all, bar their gimmick of gravity and air; you control exactly the same on the ground. The mission are padded beyond belief, resulting in grindfests which will last ages. Get used to hearing the phrase "A few more components", as it is used a lot, along with "wait we have to go here first". Metroid style backtracking in a FPS...\n- The levels are a bunch of interconnected linear paths of which you will be backtracking along most of during the story missions (cause backtracking is one of FPS gamer's most beloved mechanics!). And yes, I said story missions. Not side missions sending you back to somewhere, but straight up backtracking in th mandatory story missions...\n- The enemies are almost completely reskins with one or two quirks. The soldiers are just hyperion soldiers with more health and medics, the scavs are just bandits with jetpacks, the Torks are just spiderants with corrosive attacks and wallclimbing, the Rathyds are just Rakk with a more sustained attack, and the infected are just rats with helmets (Because rats weren't hard enough to deal with, and now they have headshot immunity!). The few enemies that aren't reskins, like the Shuggaths, are ridiculous. Huge floating sacks with tentacles with elemental attacks. Then the game begins not even reskining enemies! Yup, straight up throwing Stalkers at you with no explanation other than "R&D department" (Because again, everyone loved the guys, right?). Even a thresher makes an appearance!\n- The music is uninspired, and a very poor followup to the soundtrack mastery of Borderlands 2. The entire score is par for the course in a sci-fi based game, and has no high points, just a mediocre soundtrack to your mediocre journey.\n- The characters... Oh god... Every lovable trait in any returning characters has been scrubbed away to make room for the Memes, such as Moxxi, who is now only innuendo, instead of the clever character from Borderlands 2, who had surprising levels of depth to her.. There's no originality in the new characters either, just a shallow representation of a single character trait, which is then amplified to truly irritating levels! The Australian character is a mechanic/homosexual/story-writer/blackmarket-dealer, who has almost no relevance past the first few missions, and is a poor followup character to Sir Hammerlock, whose role she fills. The British kid is... British. A pickpocket/junk-dealer/information-dealer/salvager who ends up WELL overstaying his welcome in one mission which has the most padding out of all the ones I played and only serves to remind you that you're not done yet! Jack is the one who has suffered the worst, though, coming across as a jerk right from the beginning and only getting worse as the game advances. Wasn't the game supposed to be his fall from grace, the story of his transformation from decent leader to the tyrannical dictator that we all loved to hate? Well, he starts as an ♥♥♥, and stays that way the whole game.\n- The writing is uninspired, lazy, and predicable. Plot points are forecast way in advance (Hmmm, an AI companion? Hope shes not gonna go crazy!), are often lackluster, and most often serve to make the game's characters worse. Again, Handsome Jack just become less and less enjoyable, and his actions aren't justifiable in the least throughout the game.\n\nIn the end, The Presequel is a disapointment. It fails to live up to its hype, and even its previous incarnations. The gameplay is slow, the lootdrops even wors than BL2, the bosses tiresome, the vaunted GRINDER being just another moneysink... The only things in this game that work flawlessly are the elemnts that they ripped from BL2's chest. Heck in some portions of the levels you can see that they would import loot containers, but not change how some of them looked, resulting in a design clash that rips you right out of the experience.\n\nMy advice? Don't buy this. I know it looks shiny and crazy, but thats on the surface. It is dull grindfest on the bottom that somehow takes the Borderlands Formula and makes it boring. Play Borderlands 2. Play Borderlands. Don't play this. Maybe once the price on a 75% sale, but even then, think carefully.\n\nFinal veredict: 5/10 (only for the stuff ripped from BL2)","October 15, 2014","false","106.4"," 174 of 308 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","174","308","0","17"

Until it recently went on sale for 70% off that gave me the thought of "Why the heck not?" because I like the Borderlands lore. Before playing this game, I already played all 1, 2 and even the Tales from the Borderlands but only when I finished the point & click game I came to realized that Pandora is an interesting world to discover. Additionally, as the credits rolled I got surprised that the supporting actor for Troy Baker[en.wikipedia.org] was Chris Hardwick[en.wikipedia.org]!

It's an unfinished alpha of the game with nothing more than new names and reskins. Literally nothing is differnet besides new gun types and the removal of other gun types. The Oz kit gets in the way more than not because sometimes you find yourself struggling for oxygen and there is nothing you, and the new cars are so horrific that you can't steer barely at all, and the gravity becomes extremely high once you are in a car. Me and my friend had a great time getting stuck in a pit that you have to go in for a side quest, only to find that there is no way out other than jumping off the edge and killing yourself. He also had fun taking screenshots of me walking through walls and pipes and ground pounding through towers. We even found one account of a wire system that cut off in the middle of no where in the air, and the wires were not running through the electric poles, but instead just randomly in the air with no sense of texture at all.\n\nUpdate: The more you go through the game the more you notice these horrible glitches and bugs like a bosses shield drones getting stuck in walls so you can't kill her.

However, I cannot in good concience recommend it to anyone who isn't a huge enough fan to have already bought it by this point. Just go grab BL2 for wicked cheap during a sale.\n\nWhen the price drops, you should totally buy the crap out of it, but for $60, absolutely not worth it. Shoot for $20 ($25 with season pass) like it was during the summer sale.\n\n\nWhy would a diehard Borderlands lover like myself tell you to avoid this till the price drops?\n\nFeels like a big BL2 DLC    Only a few mechanics have changed. Sure, we've got the Grinder and low gravity, but what else is there that isn't just an older concept with a new coat of paint? New vehicles? Scarlett's. Moon rocks? Eridium. Moon chests? Dice chests from Tiny Tina's. The vast majority of the weapons are the same. The same UI flaws exist (including a new one, the 4-vehicle Moon Zoomy interface is terrible, half off the screen). The list goes on and on.\n\nBeta quality    With 24 hours of gametime since the release, I've suffered at least 5 crashes. Yes, Borderlands saves often, but not often enough to prevent me having to clear those baddies several times. I also had 2 failable quests instantly fail when going through area-based checkpoints. In one, I killed a special thresher and took the elevator up into a shop. The quest promptly failed, citing my having (not actually) died, conveniently locking me in until I reloaded the game. A release quality game should not have these issues.\n\n\nAll that aside, I do rather enjoy the game.\n\nLow Gravity    Gravity actually adds a lot to the immersion of the game - variable gravity based on area adds an element of realism to buildings. Low gravity allows for a lot more interesting maneuvering and varied combat. Don't stop there, though, because low gravity allows you to really get into every nook and cranny, really allowing you to appreciate the beauty of the entire world by boost jumping all over it. Butt slams are another great low gravity mechanic, making it easy to deal with many small enemies at once - in my opinion, a rather annoying (and common) situation.\n\nThe Grinder    Combine, reuse, recycle. Got old or junk gear? No worries, just combine and upgrade. Want a specific legendary? No, you don't need to grind the boss that drops it any more, just any two junk legendaries and a purple of the right type, then repeat till you get what you want. It's great but almost feels too easy, something I'm sure irks many of the BL2 fanbase.","October 15, 2014","false","115.0"," 62 of 106 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","62","106","0","0"

Unlike the previous Borderlands games, TPS does not take place on Pandora, but on the moon which is called Elpis. If you've played Borderlands 2, you would know that TPS share a heavily resemblence of it with the same graphic engine and UI so many vetaran fans would picked up the game right away. Following the tradition, you have the option to select four playable characters/classes with two more coming on the way as DLCs. You'll discovered some new and old faces NPCs and get to know their story. Get ready to play as the bad guys along with Jack, the man who will eventually becomes Handsome Jack in Borderlands 2.\n\nLet's talk about the new gameplay mechanic. There are two enviroment areas that you should be familiar with. They're called Atmosphere and Vaccum. Atmosphere is a area with oxygens. If you're in this area, your O2 gauge won't deplete, but your jump mobility will be limited. Unlike in the previous installment, you can only ignite enemies in an area with an atmosphere.  Vaccum is a area with no oxygens. If you're in this area, your O2 gauge will deplete over time unless you're playing as the Fragtrap, but your jump mobility will be much greater. Once you get a Oz kit, you will gain the ability to "double jump". Oz kit also allowed you to do a slam attack by jumping mid-air and holding crouch will do a AoE damage around yourself so it's a good way to get enemies with melee off your back. If you run out all of your O2 gauge , your health will drain over time regardless of your shield, but not to worry, there are oxygen and atmosphere areas that will replenish your O2 gauge. TPS also introduced the Cyro elemental that freezes  your enemy and immobilize them temporary. What's great if you freeze a enemy in the air, watch them fall down and shatter into pieces if they've taken enough damage from the fall. Last but not least lasers are a new type of guns that comes in various forms. They can take many shapes like assault rifles, shotguns, and sniper rifles and they all use the same ammo. Last but not least, you can use the grinder to dispose three of the same quality guns that you don't like and it will pop out a new gun with the same or better quality. What you get is depend on what kind of recipe you've used so becareful on using the grinder.\n\nIn conclusion, BLTPS is a great game and it lives up to the name of Borderlands, but it does have flaws and many bugs including gamebreaking ones. Some NPCs will take forever to finish up their echo conversation and it's a pain to wait for them to shut up until you could do your next objective. There are time when you have to backtrack many times to complete side quests and you could get easily lost until you become familiar with the areas. If you guys are Borderlands fans, but you're worry about the price and you're afraid the developers didn't put in enough efforts to make a illegitimate game, then perhaps it's better for you to wait for a price drop or the inevitable GOTY edition. BLTPS story ties the knot of the events of BL1 and BL2 really well. You will see and understand a different side of Jack and why he became the vicious villain that we all loved to hate, Handsome Jack.","November 2, 2014","true","724.1"," 70 of 121 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","70","121","0","0"

In short, it's very similar to Borderlands 2 from every angle, and I recommend it to these loving BL series and other open world+ FPS+RPG combination.  But as a Borderlands fan, I have to say it's not as good as BL2, overall. Here are what I've realized so far.\n\nPros:\n\n1. low gravity and jump pad system, which makes combats more flexible and three-dimensional.\n2. brand new atmospheric environment\n3. more interactions between NPCs and your character\n4. novel laser weapons and cryo element\n5. better item scaling, which is like Borderlands 1\n6. moral dilemma, no longer good/evil binary boundery\n7. novel grinder (a new way to get high/rare quality items)\n\nCons:\n\n1. Laser weapons are overpowered , which makes other types of weapons more or less useless, which narrows down weapon selection.\n2. less extensive contents (main story, enemies and environments)\n3. limited looting, legendary farming has been swtiched from boss farming to vendor machine farming, which isn't as resonable as BL 2 imo. and raid boss is lack of originality.\n4. less dramatic main story\n5. way less explorable map as BL2, while still much time wasted on covering the mission path (running/jumping from mission spot A to B).\n\nOthers:\n\n1. The combat is way less intense than BL 2.\n2. same humors as usual\n\nConclusion:\n\n$60 is a bit expensive for it, but it's still a good game compared with many junks with the same price on Steam. Wait and grab it until sales and it'll make you worthwhile.","December 16, 2014","true","378.2"," 78 of 136 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","78","136","0","0"

I take back almost everything I said about Borderlands 2 and the Pre-Sequel, before I played the latter title. BL2 struck me as very very derivative of the first game and way too impressed with itself -- I mean, it worked as a business idea, the game sold a ton. But I really thought Gearbox was creatively bankrupt after playing most of BL2 a while back, and never planned to get the Pre-Seq.\n\nBut holy crap, I was wrong. The Pre-Seq is BY FAR the best in the series IMO. They added some ridiculously fun mechanics with the O2 tanks, some very clever (and slightly annoying, but mostly clever) altitude-based environment puzzles, and the LASERS, man. The lasers are FUN. SO much fun. The characters' skills are way way better than 2's -- Athena is my girl all the way, although I also dig Nisha's gunslinger skills. Wilhelm is a pretty amusing character, and I dunno about the robot. Don't care, honestly, but I do plan to fiddle with him at some point. Actually, I'm so glad they finally regulated him to a much more secondary role, because I don't know about you, but that "ha ha I'm an annoying sidekick" joke was running damned thin.\n\nAnd they actually wrote a -- so far -- rather decent story that isn't 75% pop-culture jokes, and they manage to give some of the characters some personality, AND the level design & art design blow me completely away. The writing: as much as I love Anthony Burch, the comedy in BL2 got super old after you ran around Pandora for the tenth time, and there's only so much "look at me I made an internet joke" I can take, honestly. The Pre-Seq actually puts forth a fairly interesting story and the comedy is mostly derived from the characters and who/what they are, not all the quotes they can spout at you. And that is a HUGE leg up in my opinion.\n\nI still get frustratingly lost in some of the environments and the map still sucks, but wow. I'm kind of in love with this one.\n\n--\n\nHaven't finished the main story yet, so this review may change in the future. But, so far, if you're a Borderlands fan, you'll be pleasantly surprised with the third installment of "Pithy Punks Populate Pandora: PEW PEW PEW".","October 9, 2015","true","205.8"," 144 of 258 people (56%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","56","144","258","14","15"

I was not expecting it to be as good as it is. The story line is great, asnwering questions you might have had from the Borderlands games 1 and 2, as well as opening up more questions (maybe the DLCs will shed further light).\n\nI like the low gravity aspect - I was worried about playing with low grav at first, but it's fun and doesn't impede gameplay. The butt slam is a favourite. Plenty of new weapons, with Cryo being a replacement for slag in some ways. Vending machines have many Legendary items, so it's worth checking them wherever you go. They're in the machines more often than as weapon drops. Lasers are a nice addition to the game too.\n\nThe characters are interesting to play, each of them have a nice unique blend of options, and I think they're well balanced.\n\nSome of the side missions are a pain, causing you to retrace your steps, but there's not too many like that, and a lot of side missions can be skipped if you're not interested in the lowly weapon rewards. Good for XP and Moon Stones (like eridium from BL2). There are way too many bugs in the game, some that were ported from BL2 and some new ones; hopefully these will be addressed though I don't hold my breath.\n\nOverall I really enjoy this game, more than I expected to, and am looking forward to Playthrough 3 when it becomes unlocked. Also looking forward to more content in the DLCs.","October 30, 2014","true","614.5"," 86 of 151 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","86","151","0","1"

Gameplay and character "classes" were solid, fun, and had obvious roles.\n\nBorderlands 2:\nGreat addition to the series. Better story. Each of the characters trees added a slighly different to the character, with some characters able to fill different roles. (range/melee/support/tank). One con to this game was that the non-dps trees felt a little lack luster, like more time was put into designing more ways to mow down foes.\n\nBorderlands Pre-sequel:\nStory pretty good, but not on the same level as Borderlands 2. Low gravity wasn't a bad idea, added some different gameplay elements, but was used way to much. With you either getting way to used to it and try and jump high while inside or being thankful that you are inside for less gimicky gameplay.\nHowever, Cyro-elemental weapons were a great addition for crowd control and shatter damage on weaker oponents.\nI also thought the non-dps trees were given far more love in this game.\nTanks getting more than just HP increase and damage reductions. Like being able to increase the resistences  of you and your party when hit with a status affects and splash it back on your enemies.\nSupport trees can help keep the group alive without fully relying on their action skill to heal or rez someone quickly.\n\nOverall. Borderlands 2 had a better story. Borderlands pre-sequel had better character class design.\n\nHope for the future of the Borderlands series is to add more active skills.

It took a risk.

In spite of the handicaps a publisher may lay upon you, it isn't personal when we dislike a work of this caliber.\n\nI feel that my/our dislike of forced sequels sometimes comes off as an affront to those that busted their butts in the hellish crunches that make up the life of your average studio employee/work for hire.

May you be a potential buyer or a gamer who has it and wants to see what other people think. let me elborate what is wrong with the game.\n\n1) Humor is dead.\n- the jokes are flatlined and if its a sex joke the character saying will explain it to you. censorship is also in the game but not bleeped out instead with replacing words like b***h with  "taint". Characters will often use the term " son of a taint" which will drive you insane pretty damn soon. This is what makes borderlands engaing as it bring character to characters ( not a pun). you see non of that. The citizens of the city you go to as a main hub for suppiles and quest are dull. nothing they say or do is interesting. in bl2 they were amusing at times but annoying. that aleast made them noticable. Character devolpment is slow and empty as they rely one every new characters sense of humor to be the character for them\n2) Story.\n-the story supossedly follows handsome jacks rise to power in the hyperion corpartion to become the CEO, madman and all around smartass we all know and love from BL2. We however see little of that he wants to build a robot army to fight the lost legion and take heilios the station. most of the central story ACTUALLY REVOVLES AROUND YOU DOING FETCH QUEST AND PREPARING TO HELP JACK ROBOT ARMY RATHER THEN ACTUAL FOCUSING ON JACK HIMSELF. Thats right. And guess what? NO ANGEL. Thats the problem with this game as its shows in BL2 that jack used angle to trick roland and co. to open the vault. in this game we see the erdidum explosin on pandora and get to meet liltih and roland on the moon just for them to tell us to ♥♥♥♥ off . so where angel in all of this? why did jack trick them into opening the vault when he wasnt even ceo of hyperion? major plot hole.\n\n-little time is fousced on jack and we do see his ugly side from time to time but nothing to show his moralty and insights and personality changing to more chaotic or justifying evil with good intenions until the end when he becomes handsome jack. there was almost no character devolepment into jack and more put into the commander of the lost legion as she has over a dozen autologs on elphis to find and several missions on her background. but non for jack unlike in bl2. Jack is also so... so BORING. His jokes arent funny, he only talks when for filler converstations or for objectives and he only had one good moment in the story where he actually made an effort to show emotion. This is frighting to me. Jack was one of the best things in the borderlands series and his writing has been declining since tiny tinas dlc.\n\n-Absouletly terrible pacing, the worst ive seen in a games story so far.\n-rarely any plot twist and all dont have the drama or flare as in the past\n3) characters\n-the ruined moxxi by dropping her whole character. no flirts. no intuendos. no charm . just sighs and complaints with one intersing mission with her background.\n-no new characters are memorable enough\n-they toke out all the humor and charm in the bl characters are suppose to have and ignored that for new characters.they are just... there. little humor and jokes from them.\n-pickle. tiny tinas replacement in the game is with you for a good quarter of the game. hes GTG. voice is annoying as heck as hes attmepting to act like a english or british gentlemen with terms like wot and chin wag. non of the zeal of intersesting personality and is devoid of humor( or good humor)\ngameplay\n-Sexulaity. Few characters in this game are gay or oversexualized but when they are 2k austrailia is constantly reminding you. Janey springs is consantly stating how " Shes not into guys" and is always hitting on athena if you play her. Several other characters do this as well and when you decide to base your characters almost soley on their sexuality, thats just horrible writing.\n- loot systems sucks as you only get purples on missions and in gold chest\n- almost the exact same as bl2\nthis is just the negative and its incomplete. ill post another review to cover more later","October 14, 2014","false","168.7"," 125 of 227 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","125","227","0","3"

They have been fixing little ♥♥♥♥ that no one even knew was bugged/glitched in the first place and have refused to patch the skill bug and make respawnable bosses.\n\nOverall:\n\nThis is did NOT live up to the hype I had for this game at all. Its way too buggy and boring. I really enjoyed Borderlands 1 and Borderlands 2 but this is just unacceptable for a Borderlands game. Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel was NOT worth the 60 bucks I spent on this game. I classify this game as a game to pick up when its on sale for like 50%-66% off. Other than that its not worth the time or money. DLC can't save this game right now.

This is a very long Borderlands 2 DLC done by the B-Team.  It feels a bit lazy, but it's still a lot of fun.\n\nThe Good: The story is interesting and there's a lot to do. There's four new playable characters and they're gender balanced (the game, as a whole, is excellent in that respect). Low gravity, butt-slams, lasers, freeze attacks and Australian in-jokes round out the new features.\n\nThe Bad: There's not really anything bad. There's a few polygon tearing glitches, all minor.\n\nThe Lazy: It's the Borderlands 2 engine, so if you were expecting something really new, this isn't it. The writing is not up to Borderlands 2 par. Character gestures are rarely customized resulting in them repeating the same generic ones while talking. There's not nearly the variety of enemies and locations as in Borderlands 2.\n\nThe Weird: You can play as Claptrap!  SOLD!  Why wouldn't you want to play as a murderous, incompetant robot?  [Hint: you hate his voice.]  It's about as fun and stupid as you'd imagine.  His action skill is a random version of other Vault Hunter's powers, except done wrong.  Example: You can get two guns like the Gunzerker, but you never stop firing.  It gets a bit confusing when you're talking to other Claptraps.\n\nCompared to most FPS, it's excellent, and this is why I recommend it.  Compared to Borderlands 2, it's not quite up to par, but they set a very high bar.","December 23, 2014","true","135.8"," 35 of 59 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","35","59","0","0"

It adds 4 new characters, including Memetrap. I like how it automatically sets the graphics at 480p and turns off V-Sync and AA by default so it looks like a PS2 game. I also like how the collision detection occasionally doesn't work and money and ammo regularly fall through the floor\n\n10/10 wouldn't meme ever again. Only reason I have this is b/c it came with my graphics card.\n\nUPDATE 1: Against my better judgement, I have progressed a little more through the game and have found great new features, such as missions that completely change. This one time, I had to get some ECHO logs for someone and then before I could finish the mission, she told me to kill some random rock monster. It was great. Speaking of her, I like how progressive this game is and Janey Springs is a good example! Instead of just making a gay character, they decided to make her a creepy stalker and have every other line from her be about how she is gay. That's a realistic portrayal of a gay person. I also like how you only get 2 types of weapons until you enter Concordia and most of the weapons are terrible.

Although small, it makes a huge difference, the feel of gliding across a map unhindered, slamming down into opponents, and having more free movement is wonderful.  So much so I feel more games should have it.  If they make a sequel to the series, I hope they bring it back as a jetback or something, but with less of a limiting feature on the oxygen count, which is the only downside to this mechanic.\n-charater personailty\nanother small adjustment that has done leagues to affect the game positively.\nYour character now has things to say, and responds to people, and events.  They even have some quick backstory to most of them that you can find throughout the story.\n-enemy variety\nthis is something that it's predecessors didn't have, as I often found myself getting bored, or annoyed at the same old callouts over and over again.  Here it seems they bothered to record more dialogue for enemies so that it doesn't grate on you after a while, and it seems that the enemy types are at least as much as the last two games.\n-co-op gameplay\nalways a plus in this game, but not necessary to enjoy the game on it's own.  Although it does help quite a bit.\nNegatives:\n-Bugs out the ♥♥♥\nYou will run into a myriad of bugs in this game, from game geometry not working right, to MORE then frequent game breaking bugs.  When I first started the game I got locked out of one of the very first quests because a gate wouldn't open.  Later on I couldn't proceed in NG+ because a verbal exchange didn't go off so another door locked me out, I gave the game a break for a while when I was asked if I wanted to skip a segment of gameplay that I'd already done, and it gave the game a fatal error that caused it to crash everytime I said yes.\n-No player base\nfor a game that has a larger emphasis on online and co-op play, the player base is even smaller than borderlands 2 at release, maybe the pc crowd is waiting for it to go on sale, or maybe they're not keen on buying what looks and feels a bit like a souless cash in.\n-Game length is short\nCompared to the length of the bas game of borderlands 2, I was severely discontented with the length of this game.  It's almost as short as the first game, and pales in comparison to the second.\n-lack of enviornments\nCompared to the second game, this game's enviornments are not nearly as varied.  Despite the fact that the second and first got more milage out with some really nice dlcs, this game does not even get close to their base game enviornments.\nThere is, hyperion moon base, the final area (which is really interesting but short), and an icy moon surface.  That's it.\n-looting system\nThe loot system is slightly better than 2 but still not as good as 1, your only chance at finding good weapons and gear is either by grinding raid bosses(3 in the game) endlessly, or getting the items through a cheat device or a co-op partner.  You're not going to see anything of value out on the field, or in the vending machines.  Your only options are to boss fight and get lucky, or grind some weapons and hope you get something decent\n-mics don't work and connection problems\nMics do not work properly in game, and connections will be unstable, despite good internet connections.  Something that was never a problem in the other games\n-garbage DLC\nFinally the dlc is lackluster, and overall disapointing, the one thing that borderlands NEVER did.  In the past, the dlc was both interesting, added new enviornments, good dialogue, more items, and SOMETIMES a new character.  In fact the initial game had a huge dlc campaign with a ton of new things, the second game had the same thing, but you were guaranteed four dynamite dlcs AND two extra characters, with other dlcs replacing the characters for the second season.\nNow for it's outrageous price you get nothing.  So far, we've gotten one good character, one lackluster character, and an arena.  And there's only ONE MORE DLC LEFT before the season is over.  It's probably going to be short and awful as well, and so far, none of these have served to extend the gameplay much more than an hour or two.\n\n\nAll in all, it's not worth full price.  If it goes on sale for 15$ for all of the content, then I'd say it's worth it.  But I wouldn't pay sale price plus the admission fee for dlc.  While I like the game, and think it's a step in the right direction in some ways, I do not believe for a second it should've retailed for this much, and should've sold at a more humble price at release.\n\nWait for a sale if anything.","January 27, 2015","false","48.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dxbulletride/recommended/261640/","dxbulletride","Unusual_Shrub","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dxbulletride/","81 products in account","This game was a huge dissapointment. How anybody can rate this game in a positive light has never played a Borderlands game before and I would even go as far as saying has never played a game before. There are huge gaps in the story, random invisible walls, stupid mechanics, an extrememly small amount of bosses and unrewarding loot. Let me start with the loot. I played this game with 3 other friends and we all played a different class. We saw 3 legendaries, 1 of them being from a vendor and the latest drop was around level 21. We found ourselves being extremely overwhelmed with the enemies strictly because we had no loot drops. All the crates and loot thingys around Elpis contained commons and greens, sometime an epic or two. But most of all we found ourselves grinding out money to afford to buy a weapon or grenade mods to kill whatever we needed to kill at the time. Next up are all the glitches in the game. There are random invisible walls all over the world in spots where you have a clear line of sight to a ledge or a cliff that will just stop you and make you fall to your death; there are gaps in which you must jump over with your vehicle but even with a boost going top speed youd make it 50% of the time. The rest of the time youre falling helplessly into lava pits. Elevators will randomly glitch out and keep going up and kill you, bosses jetison loot out of their bodies when you kill them only to find yourself chasing the loot into a black abyss of nothingness, thus losing the loot forever. The characters are probably the most disappointing thing to me. Athena and Claptrap by far talk the most, and even then its not that much. Wilhelm and Nisha say next to nothing which is dissapointing because they are Jacks right hand people in Borderlands 2. They never address very important plots holes (I will not say in fear of spoiling it for people), and the end of the game seems extremely rushed. In total there are about 9 bosses. All of which are just point and shoot with no mechanics whatsoever. The typical comedy in the Borderlands series falls short in almost every avenue. The only redeming thing was Claptraps typical quips. Other than that, nothing. Cringe worthy material that is sure to make anyone feel dumb and awkward. There are pop culture references in the game that are just God awful. So awful to the point I almost ALT+F4'd out of the game. Having put in hundreds of hours in Borderlands on 360 and hundreds of hours on Borderlands 2 I can say I lvoe this series. With the exception of this. It is terribly short (we beat the entire series in 16 hours) and that was doing side quests and messing around at some times. The raid boss is just a harder version of the final boss. Overall this was a HUGE dissapointment and I will probably never load this game up again. I am very sad.","October 14, 2014","false","16.9"," 88 of 160 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","88","160","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ratsz/recommended/261640/","ratsz","The Stranger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ratsz/","105 products in account","Be careful for spoilers.\nI was so excited for this game. Borderlands 2 was the first Steam Game I bought on my new account and it was so amazing that I even forced my friends to buy the game too. And they LOVED it. We played together for hours and I met some really crazy and fun people to conquer the Legendary Weapons and bosses together. When there was a new DLC out, I knew it was worth the price and I had to get it.\nNot because the game was unplayable and you needed the DLC to feel like you had a real game now, like EA *cough*, but because it just made the game a complete new adventure and the whole atmosphere was renewed.\nThe Tiny Tina DLC? It blew my mind. It's my favorite DLC and the complete thing is amazing. So yes, I did pre-order Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel.\nThe trailer showed nothing too exciting for me, but the game and the way it was played have always made the Borderlands series what it is now. Borderlands 1? Great. Fast. LOOT. Rare loot was rare. The bosses were innovative. Then, Borderlands 2. Amazing. LOOT. RARE LOOT. Legendary LOOT. The bosses? ♥♥♥♥ing art.\n\nBut Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel? Not so good. Yes, I was disappointed. A lot.\nWhy, you ask? Well, let me tell you.\nFirst I thought the game was alright and I was excited to start, but that didn't work out too well. For me, living in Europe, the game was said to come out on the 16th. Didn't happen. Had to stay up until the 17th 1am to get it. I played for one hour, was level five until the first bug arrived and threw ♥♥♥♥ in my face.\nCouldn't shoot anymore, never gained EXP, didn't level. So I restarted. And everything was good.\nBut the game, it just didn't feel alright. It was slow, enemies literally approach you in slow motion, and the fast, colory shooty became slow and grey. The colors kind of vanished from the world (In- and outside) and the only time you find a really Borderlands 1 and 2 feeling atmosphere is in the very last place. Yes, the very last one.\nAnd to get there, you had to somehow play your way through the not triggering dialoges, enemies spawning underground and not being able to continue the quest, loot that flies away, getting thrown off the map and dying, jumping way too slow and far and dying, somehow glitching through the round and dying and enemies that do not care if you're around until you shoot. Not even them. Just, shoot.\nThe AI is crap, but after a while you just gloss over that. But why did the game take me 9h to complete the main story?\nWell, because the quest-markers were ♥♥♥♥. They showed that an objective was right in front of you, same level.\nOnly to find out that you had to go all the way around, up, press some buttons and then jump down to get it. Without mentioning it. Nice. Took me ages. And that wasn't fun. Oh, and one more thing: If you're like me and you accept side quests to do them later, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. Some Side quests give you a mission weapon, like in Borderlands 2. But not all of the, are marked as mission weapons.\nThat way I couldn't do most of them. Accepted them while doing the main quest or just accepting all side quests to do them later. Nope.\nThe Nova Shield? Not even mentioned. The weapon to get the peaceful enemies angry? Ha, na. And the mission weapons you already used?\nThey stay mission weapons. Forever.\n\nThen why did you keep playing it?\nOh, well. Even tho the game is not like Borderlands 1 & 2, it's still Borderlands.\nThe dialogs are still cheesy and sometimes make you giggle. The characters feel real and all have their own secrets and personalities. The voice acting is good. The world is colorless but still nice to look at, sometimes. The cutscenes weren't unnecessary and helpful and the shooting everything was fun.\n\n\nAnd what about the weaaaappoooons? They good?\nThat's another point, actually. The weapon drops from enemies are ♥♥♥♥. But the new elements, like laser and frost, are amazing and can actually make the game easier. Just getting them is hard. If they don't fly away.\nOn the very last quest there is a little boss that spawns other and more enemies. My weapon froze him and it took me not even 5 seconds to get his shield and him down. The loot flew off into space and was never seen again. Win.\nBut it's still nice to freeze your enemies (not forever), or laser them, or just shoot them. The way the weapons look is nothing new or special. Like Borderlands 2.\n\nAnd the story? I mean, did you listen to it?\nYes, I did. Only after replaying a level for the 6th time I didn't, because the dialouge from the VERY beginning of this level started playing. Like, when you arrived. Even if you have been there for 24h.\nThe story at the beginning wasn't exciting and only when the "flashbacks" spoke, you knew somethign would happen.\nIn the middle of the game the story SLOWLY evolved. And the only REAL time I was really soaked into the game and didn't want to stop playing was the end.\nHow the bosses from Borderlands 1 & 2 just came together and EVERYTHING, I mean, EVERYTHING was explained.\nIt all makes sense now. All two games before make sense. Moxxie's secret was INSANE, Jack's growing was SO NICELY DONE, and the old Vault Hunters, like Lilith and Modecai from BL1, actually felt REAL if you played them back in the days, because they ACTUALLY remembered and all that. It was great.\nAnd the last cutscene, where Borderlands 2 pretty mch begins, just makes you want to reply Borderlands 2 because now you have so much background, it's just mind blowing.\n\nAnd Pro's con's or what?\n\nPros:\n- Growing story, which was nicely told, but boring at first.\n-Growing characters and enemies. (Like, when new kinds of Guardians kept appearing, nicely done.)\n-The first two games being explained and remembered.\n-Flashbacks were nicely done.\n-Old characters that were still evolving, even thos they had beenin 2 games before.\n-New weapon elements.\n-New enemies.\n-The moon.\n\nCon's:\n-Bad loot that mostly flies off into space.\n-AI mostly doesn't care if you are around or not.\n-GLITCHES THAT MAKE THE GAME UNPLAYABLE.\n-Invincible enemies.\n-Enemies making you or your quest items stuck and you have to replay the whole thing.\n-Leveling is much easier because there are so many enemies everywhere.\n-The game feels slow.\n-Oxygen.\n-Gravity.\n\nAnd all in one? Would you recommend it?\nThe game was good, but the feeling that you got at the end should have kicked in earlier. The "I don't want to stop playing" feeling just didn't exist. Until the last one hour. And then it was over. The story is good and evolving. So are the characters. They feel real and make old memories come back. The loot system is crap, but the new elements make up for it, same with the enemies. The AI is ♥♥♥♥, but the new enemieraces balance that a little bit.\nThe MultiPlayer is again more fun than the SinglePlayer, but that's clear, I guess. /Not anymore.\nI'd say I would recommend the game, just not NOW. (23.10.14)\nIt's too buggy and I actually stopped playing for some days because it kept killing me for no legit reason. I once had an enemy under the ground and it didn't trigger the next spawn of enemies and I then decided to make my game online for everyone and no one had any idea. Later, some guy threw like a hundred grenades at the ground and he died. Nice.\n\nIF the bugs get fixed and you are through the main story line quest, there are TONS of side quests that I have not played yet. But like in BL1 & 2, I guess they will help you make your ingame time worth it.\nUPDATE: Most of them are bugged or are broken easily and it stops being fun.\n\nI didn't like the game until the very end. And that shouldn't and didn`t ever happen in any Borderlands so far. I was disappointed and even stopped playing. But I'd still say that it feels like a Borderlands, just not a complete game.\nIf you are a fan, like me, you need to play it. If not, don't waste your time and money. Wait for a sale.\n\n6/10.","November 5, 2014","false","17.9"," 45 of 79 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","45","79","0","0"

The grinder is a great addition but I feel they should've had more bosses well mini bosses that dropped these legendary items instead of having to make them.

This game DOES add a lot of new things to the experience to freshen it up a bit. I feel like the game relies a bit too much on its sense of humor as a selling point. Honestly as a successor to the previous game, I felt as though this was a let down, let alone the price of it. Game play is still solid, shooter at its core. May revise this depending on how the DLCs that inevitably will come out do. All in all nothing too new here, didn't feel like it was worth 60 bucks.\n\nEDIT: After having had a chance to more thuroughly play this game and feel it out, I'm revising my previous score of 6/10, I now give this game a 4/10. Between the amount of hindering glitches from the previous game they left in (mostly in the UI), the inclusion of new ones (mostly graphical that I've seen at this point), and the removal of some beneficial ones, it has become obvious to me that they made no honest attempts at playtesting this game outside of the already known bugs that gave us an "unfair edge on the game", and giving little to no thought or care of the bugs that impeded us in the previous game (Ex: The UI bug in bl2 where it would jump to the opposite end of the list you are selecting if you attempted to interact with it too quickly). In addition to this, the AI feels the same in how annoying it was in bl2 where their pathing and movement was generally braindead until you got put into fight for your life, at which point every enemy within range would make a direct beeline for cover, sometimes as I've noticed, even clipping through walls and floors to do so, this made the combat feel tedious at times, and outright unfair at others. They also essentially remade the BNK3R fight from bl2 which I had a personal distaste for, if only because there were periods of anywhere from 2-5 minutes at a time where the boss would not even come into range of attack putting you in a deadlock of dealing with enemies and dodging mortar rounds from the boss that you could not hit. While they fixed not being able to hit the boss for this one, they made its attacks much more damaging, gave it more health from the looks, and threw in harder enemies to fight between phases, all of this is compounded with the fact that I found ammo to be scarce in this fight, constantly putting me in a position of buying ammo, or leaving the area to go find more. In general this game offers nothing new that is any good beyond laser weapons, zero gravity, and the cryo element which just feels like a slag that stuns. The story was a decent link between games however, but not enough to make up for its shortcomings.\n\nEDIT 2: I feel as though I may have been too harsh with the review. All of these things I still hold to now, however I no longer feel as though they are as much of a detriment to the experience as I initially gave credit for. In all of it's shortcomings, it is still a Borderlands game. That being said, several changes and patches were made to this game to this point in time, a lot of these changes were bad, some were subsequently good to fix them, and public accounts from the devs were made that tweaked some members of the Borderlands community a certain way. Social media stuff aside, these changes IN THE END helped improve the game to a certain extent. With that in mind, what will likely be the final revision in my score is now 5/10. I still do not recommend it over BL2, but if you are looking for a fresh experience, provided you take it with a grain of salt, you may enjoy this game.","October 14, 2014","false","73.4"," 167 of 311 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","167","311","0","1"

The havent improved anything really. Instead of better loot drops they made purples and blues drop like crazy but then made them ♥♥♥♥... Found a BLUE LV 13 SMG, Then found a White LV14 SMG... WOW magic the white one is better, WTF even is that. I find full purple gear and 3 levels later theyre all ♥♥♥♥ compared to blues or god dam green items... Moonstone drops are rediculouse compared to the rate of Eridium drops, not a bad thing but I maxed out nearly all my Upgrades without even using that infinate Moonstone Glitch. The story is hardly SUPER AWESOME when it actually gets going it is but its constant time-wasting in tasks is ♥♥♥♥ING SOUL DESTROYING... A simple enough task turns into 40 extra minutes of ♥♥♥♥ing round doing stuff, They did it in BL2 I hated it, they do it again. I would rather have a campaign that lasts 4 hours of constant running and gunning then 10 hours of sorta gunning but mainly going backwards and forwards between points. "Dump the methane into the lava it will cool it..." I could already see the console wasnt going to do it because hey why actually let me do something when you can get me to spend an extra 20 minutes arseing around doing pointless things. Vehicles are pointless due to the layout of the land the moonbuggy is a waste of time once you get use to the hover thing it becomes useful in saving 5 minutes in certain areas. The new guns are cool, cryo, laser, beam, loonstone etc. New characters are better than remaking the exact sameones again (though I can already guess theyll be some stupid DLC for that all 4 origonal characters for the amazing price of only £20 WOW that right 4 characters you have already played as in our other game and required very little additions to the game to add but well rake the money because ♥♥♥♥ you well make all the ♥♥♥♥ DLC we want and charge what we want for them...). On the subject of DLC The slaughter pit was pretty much 5 rounds and gave about as much "bad-♥♥♥ loot" as a ♥♥♥♥ing ammo machine. Out of everything there the best thing I picked up was ammo. If they release more ♥♥♥♥ing DLC like this or ♥♥♥♥ing "outfits" OOH HOW COOL ARE THEY ONLY £1.50 each and they look no different to the previouse ones and are so clearly just rejected from the game before release. Fix the ♥♥♥♥ing problems and actually release something good.

It's the husk of it. The proverbial dead horse being beaten.\n\nThe Story ...\n... sucks.\n\nI mean, we all know how it ends, right? Jack becomes a murdering psycho who enslaves the entire planet.\n\nBut he actually starts off as a really nice guy who's willing to compromise, wants to save the world, sacrifices himself for others, and places his trust heavily in his "friends".\n\nThe whole plot revolves around a number of decisions which make little to no sense. Betrayals which the characters lack motivation for, or even worse, is hand-waived based on events which took place "off-screen", before the player came along, and are part of the characters history, but aren't shared with us. What the heck, people?\n\nA lot of the major dialogs which lead to Jack becoming a murdering ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ actually have me feeling more sympathetic for him than for the so called "good guys". His shift to "evil" also feels completely unnatural and forced.\n\nEven the main characters (3 of whom are not really relevant to the greater story being told - only Athena is) feel very one-dimensional and under-represented.\n\nDid you want to find out:\n\nHow Wilhelm ended up in that robot chassis?\nHow Nisha ends up Jack's GF and Sheriff?\nHow Claptrap ends up stranded in a frozen wasteland, not to mention a completely useless idiot?\nWell, too bad, folks. The most you'll get to see - if you're patient enough to sit though the credits - are a few sketches poorly outlining those character's story lines. I mean, really? Such wasted potential for DLC content.\n\nThe Humor ...\n... sucks.\n\nNo, sorry. It doesn't suck - that's putting it far too mildly. It's absolutely terrible. Obnoxious. Childish. Forced. Over-the-top, and often mired in Australian lingo which simply doesn't resonate with most Western audiences at all.\n\nIn short it is disturbingly bad, especially for a Borderlands title.\n\nI remember laughing so hard while playing BL2 that my ribs hurt. I had few, if any moments when I even smiled during this game. Mostly I just imagined punching most of the characters into silence whenever they launched into one of their long winded and "humorous" monologues.\n\nAnd one more thing. Many of the short captions introducing important NPCs and bosses? Few were good, almost none were funny, and most simply fell flat.\n\nGone is the witty, snappy humor of Borderlands, replaced with a PG13 Australian version (apparently) written by a failed comedian.\n\nThe Loot ...\n... sucks.\n\nSeriously? I remember combing through BL2's maps looking for every hidden weapon chest, and being rewarded with pretty decent weapons. I remember switching out guns as a I found better and better stuff.\n\nNow? Thank God for Gold Keys  is all I have to say.\n\nI stopped opening chests because there was simply no point. Even white loot drops were remarkably rare, nevermind a decent blue or purple weapon.\n\nOther than that the guns are what you already experienced in BL2, except for lasers and freeze rays - which, I admit, are sort of cool, but don't make up for all the other crap.\n\nThe enemies ...\n... suck.\n\nNot exactly the brightest of the bunch. I was able to run from one objective to another without having to engage most of them because they're slow to notice you, and don't really follow you very far. It was great when all I wanted to do was get to the next way-point - which they bounce around the map in order to force you to kill as many mobs as possible.\n\nAnother important point: the game's number one progression mechanic is not to actually go places, but be stuck waiting for a door to open while enemies keep spawning on top of you. The grind is real in the Pre Sequel.\n\nThe Lunar Mechanics\n... sort of suck.\n\nThe low gravity and jump packs can be fun to play with. Constantly having to watch your O2 meter gets old within the first 10 minutes.\n\nHonestly, this is the first BL game where I had ZERO interest (see what I did there?) in trying to find the hidden content.\n\nAs many others have pointed out, driving the buggy pretty much sucks. The other vehicle type is also incredibly clunky and difficult to "jump" with, which is funny seeing how that's it's entire reason for existence.\n\nConclusion\nI picked up this game and all the DLC's for a grand total of $20. I honestly feel like I got ripped off.\n\nThis is not a Borderlands game. It's a travesty of one. It was seemingly made by people who sort of, kinda, understood what Borderlands is and got the lore somewhat right, yet managed to miss the heart and soul of it.\n\nThis game is a major disappointment.","March 22","false","15.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","2"

My review in a nutshell...\n\nDo you hate Borderlands?  Don't buy this.\nDo you love Borderlands? KEEP THOSE GOOD MEMORIES. DON'T BUY THIS. SERIOUSLY.\n\n(And if you're questioning the 400 "positive reviews" - keep in mind this.  At the time of writing this, for GLOBAL ACHIEVEMENTS, 75% of people have the achievement for hitting level 5.  Only 25% have the achievement for hitting level 10.  They aren't even playing the game, just snapjudging.  PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE.)\n\n[[-- If you still feel like playing this mess, I'll add some game-breaking bugs at the bottom of this review. Maybe it'll salvage it for you. --]]\n\nWaited a long time for this to come out, friends all took off from work and got together to binge this game to death - having loved the first two Borderlands.\n\nAfter the first 3 hours, the characters were forgettable, story was .. whatever and none of us seemed willing to say anything yet.  Scared it was just us.\n\nAfter 4 hours, we all looked at each other and went, "This kind of sucks." One of us held out saying, it's still early.\n\nAfter 7 hours, that last person gave in and agreed this was pretty bad.\n\nWe went to sleep at this point.\n\nThe next morning we completed this unpolished turd.  None of us want to even try a second playthrough.  It was one of the most unsatisfying experiences we've ever had in a co-op game.  The only fun that was had were the jokes we were making between ourselves.\n\nThis is an overpriced DLC - and that's being generous.  As a DLC, it falls short of Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep.  That had more interesting writing, varied areas and weapons.\nThe oxygen mechanic is horrible and tacked on.  You get so much oxygen tanks that it doesn't matter, it seems it's only there to be annoying.\nThe "Butt Smash" is a nice brake-mechanic, but as an offensive move - it's just tossing you into melee range so you can be killed easier.\nThe damage is horribly balanced.  There are two types of enemies, normal ones and "Badass" ones.  The former killing you in 3 hits, the latter killing you before they've seen you.  AND THIS IS PLAYTHROUGH ONE.  It felt like the level range of 51-60 in Borderlands 2.\nLoot? What loot.  The only decent loot we found were from the automatic purples we got from Shift Keys. (Which were also bugged, seems everytime we stepped up to the machine we got another set of 5.)\n\n-------------------\nBug 1:  Play Nisha.  Spec middle tree down to having double pistols.  Now equip a pistol so you have two out.  Now respec... to anything.  Ta-da.  You now keep your two pistols!  (Until you log out.)  Unlike before, you can use your Right-Click to fire your second gun instead of Zoom in with one gun.  Seems like they did a bad job modifying Salvadore's active skill here.\n\nBug 2: ONLY WORKS IN MULTIPLAYER, WHEN NOT HOSTING.  It has to do with how the client updates to the host. Anyway ... Any melee over-ride skill while using a free spin scroll mouse.  (This works in Borderlands 2 also, with Maya's Slag Bomb thing. I mean.. it's the same engine and all.)  I've only tested this with Nisha in this one though.\n\nAnyway, spec yourself to Lightning Whip in left tree.  Set your melee skill to mouse-scroll-up or down.  Spin that mouse.  Ta-da!  You'll use it like 5-10 times per use.  (It's hard to see with Nisha, but you'll notice a lot more tendrils of lightning.)  It's easier to see in BL2 when she fires out 10 slag bombs at once.\n\nEnjoy..

I've gotten nearly 100 hours out of it so far, so I suppose I can't say I haven't gotten my money's worth. But honestly I would recommend waiting until it goes on a deeper sale and/or the base price drops significantly. It is the weakest of the three Borderlands games so far. A release-day base price of $40 might have been more reasonable based on the amount of content compared to the previous games in the franchise.\n\nSo far the Season Pass has been a real disappointment. I would unreservedly NOT recommend the Season Pass until it is much cheaper.  In BL2, it was four full story expansions with story missions and side quests. So far the Pre-Sequel's Season Pass has included the Handsome Jack character add-on and the Holodome Onslaught challenge, which I admittedly haven't finished yet. Plans have been announced for the remainder of the Season Pass to be another character and one (and only one) story expansion. Of course they never really promised four massive story expansions...\n\nDon't get me wrong - I've had tons of fun playing it, but I think more of that was getting together with my Borderlands buddies online again than the actual game content. It is a good game; if you like Borderlands-style gameplay, it is an eventual must-have, but there are other games to play until this one comes down to a more reasonable price.","December 18, 2014","true","217.6"," 60 of 109 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","60","109","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerarth/recommended/261640/","nerarth","NerArth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerarth/","297 products in account","I don't think the game is really worth the current pricing. With a discount though, it's probably worth it. Here's why:\n\nPoorly balanced, just as bad if not worse than Borderlands 2. I still play BL2, mostly because I have friends to play with, but nobody I play with thinks that getting downed in 2-4 hits feels fair. In BL:TPS this doesn't seem any different. The higher level you get, the stronger the issue seems to become, especially if you're having bad luck with loot drops, i.e. having less of a fighting chance.\n\nBosses are few in my opinion and they almost don't feel meaningful, even though they're supposed to have a major relevance in the story's development.\nBosses are also, again, poorly balanced. They often have minions that join the battle, presumably so you can get second winds if you go down, but they almost do the opposite because of their own individual power.\nThe last and before-last bosses atleast had some "loot explosions" but I must have been extremely unlucky because most of it was junk, this despite the fact that I had really crappy equipment, many levels out-dated, which made me struggle to do the actual fights.\n\nThe story was good for the most part, but it feels rather short and the way the characters evolve is predictable (somewhat understandable) but I just think there could have been - a lot - more character development. Oh, right, and almost everyone that isn't a character of some importance has an australian accent, which seemed to get old a little fast for people who watched me play through.\n\nInterface. Everything is the same as BL2, which isn't bad by itself, but the BL2 UI had some ergonomic issues - such as the poor handling of the way the interface "slants" and panels block each other - and had a few glitches that haven't been fixed, like one that happens when scrolling through the backpack. In addition, the way Eridium is just translated into Moonstone is a bit unimaginative, as it serves the exact same purpose, and the story explanation doesn't feel good enough to me.\n\nOf all the Borderlands games, this has to be one with the worst bugs. Mobs go THROUGH the floors, walls, ceilings, whatever! At certain parts of the game I had to start areas over because of this as they made completing certain sections impossible. I've read that even you, the player, can fall through the ground but I didn't experience this personally.\n\nSadly zones feel too big and vehicles aren't useable in several zones, and in the ones that they are useable in, they have limited areas you'll manage to use them in. Very few fast travel stations in my opinion, considering how annoying it is to trek around. My biggest issue with the size of the zones though, is that if for some reason I needed to quit the game while doing the story bits in the larger zones, I'd get sent back to a stupid point that was possibly quite far from where I stopped playing.\nOverall the game was fun to play and the addition of the new element was "cool" (replaces slag from BL2 though) and the grinder added a bit of variety to the way you can go about getting or upgrading gear, although it feels slow and cumbersome, due to the way you will pile up even more stuff than usual in your backpack.\nBut in the end, it feels more like an expansion of sorts for BL2 than an actual new game, still having "old" issues. In addition, the fact that the story content is kind of short makes all of the content in general feel kind of short to me, with all the side-missions being more or less equal to each other than they usually would be in the past. Perhaps things will get better with DLC.\n\nI'd like to recommend a "Yes" for this, but I can't. Too many little things.","November 2, 2014","false","26.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

Copied the guns straight from Borderlands 2 but none of the humor or storytelling that made Borderlands 2 a masterpiece. Also the Australian Voices feel really out of place.\n\nThe main issues with this installment of the borderlands franchise is that it feels really lazy and unfinished in comparison to Borderlands 2 and even 1. With Borderlands 2, the game felt complete and it felt like a massive upgrade to Borderlands 1, the classes were crazy, heaps of new weapons and guns and loot, hilarious story and a blast to play through from start to finish and once you got to the end it felt like an awesome and complete experience and once the dlc came out it was like delicious extras on an already excellent game. Then the Pre - Sequal comes along, asking for $70 Australian Dollars which i believe was more than Borderlands 2 was asking for when it came out and fails to come close with the humor or enjoyability of the previous games, and once i pushed myself to endure the crappy australian accents that don't flow well at all with the characters and feels really out of place and the boring quests that require you to go from A to B to C back to A, I found and excellent end boss that was actually fun to fight and felt like old Borderlands and that was it. I believe that the Pre Sequel is much shorter than Borderlands 2 with a lot of the length coming from quests that require you to go to one side of the map and back again and to add insult to injury, a lot of the weapons are taken straight from Borderlands 2 in both name and design. In the end the game feels dull and boring in comparison the Borderlands 2 and feels incredibly unfinished, future DLC may make the game feel complete and enjoyable but no game asking for $70 or any amout should require DLC to make it fun. Save yourself the cash and wait for the GOTY editon to come out or when some dlc is out and the game is cheaper.","December 30, 2014","false","15.7"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

While in my opinion the game is not quite worth its full price, it is certaily worth picking up if you are a fan of the series and it is on sale for around 50% off. I bought this with the season pass for around £20 and finished it in co-op in about 20 hours with another 3-4 hours for the expansion area but it was still action packed and full of the normal borderlands humour. As well as this the last expansion that was added adds some very fun boss battles, weapons and fills in alot of gaps in the story once again.\n\nThings I liked:\n\n- The grinder mechanic is pretty awesome. If you're not aware of this, you can basically "combine" weapons/items of the same quality for a chance of getting something higher and there are plenty of sites showing the various "recepies" you can get and now is fixed with new patches.\n-The humour is still as good as ever with very funny and unique characters as well as some old favorites.\n-This really is great for filling in the gaps left in the story in Borderlands 2 and opens up the way for a possible Borderlands 3.\n-The new weapon types are pretty fun, I mean lazers are awesome.\n-Playing as Jack's doppleganger is damn fun.\n\nThings I didn't like:\n\n-While not a problem for me per-say, alot of people might just say, well whats new. At the end of the day, this game is pretty short in comparison to the other titles and doesn't really add anything "new" to the franchise, bar a few new weapon types but thats not really a problem as in my opinion there was nothing really wrong with borderlands 2 so why fix what ain't broke. Just something to keep in mind.\n-Lack of head options.\n-The moon jumping can be a bit hard to get the hang of at first but with some practice it becomes second nature.\n-Oranges are kinda easy to get, I mean I finished the game with all oranges bar 2 slots ( This is now fixed in the respect that purple weapons can no longer be put with moonstones in the grinder to guarentee a orange so I guess this is kinda fixed)\n\n\nOverall this game is pretty damn fun to play and especially good with friends. While it doesn't add alot in terms of new gameplay, the small things they did add just round of the borderlands experience and you really do get a nice sense of story and background to some of the characters in Borderlands 2. But I do feel that this isn't perhaps a good game for newcomers to jump into. While borderlands 2 is good for anyone who hasn't really played the first game, alot of the humour and references in the game are orintated to those who have played the previous two games and while this isn't a bad thing for me, I wouldn't recommend jumping straight to this title.\n\nBuy this game if your a fan of the series and it is on sale. You'll still get your borderlands fix, humour and bazillion guns!","February 21, 2015","true","38.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","8","11","2","0"

At first, I was disappointed as well, but I found as I played it again, I liked the energy it created. I could even so much as say I like The Pre-Sequel over Borderlands 2.\n\nThe one thing I love most about this game is that it establishes one major essence of the Borderlands series that I didn't fully comprehend until now: there are no "good" guys. Every character has flaws, every character has at least some questionable morals. And they all make mistakes! (A non-spoiler-ish example would be Mr. Torgue, who in this game has absolutely no respect for Janey or for females at all - but you hear present day Mr. Torgue butt in the story to say he apologized for his awful behavior back then. Because people can change, for either the better or the worse--)\n\nAll the characters, especially the playable ones, are quirky and lovable in their own ways. There are a lot of things in this game that I wished they did in Borderlands 2, either gameplay-wise or story-wise. I hope that they adopt some of the mechanics from this game into their next one (mostly the fact that the characters actually reply with spoken lines, which Borderlands 2 only did in their DLC, because I'm a sucker for banter).\n\nAny fan of the Borderlands series should play this game, not only does it add more lore, it adds to the story, the overall gameplay, and to the cast of colorful characters in the Borderlands series.

The low-grav tends to make loot fly into pits and lava hazards and jumping, floating enemies turns everyone into a Rakk for a short while.  Oxygen is a resource you have to manage now but running out of it is hardly an inconvenience, but you still run out of it and a voice tells you to get more of it which makes for frequent exploration interruptions.  Those are the two big mechanical changes and they're both more of a detriment to the shooting and exploring fun of the series' other games than any meaningful addition to the gameplay- now everyone just hangs in the air for a while and you have to breathe more.\n\nThe early map feels very sparse and empty, which makes sense for being a moon but isn't as conductive to man-clicking as one would hope.  Aside from bandits the earliest mob you encounter is a type of armored skag which tends to soak up bullets from your starter guns, and the badass variant turns into smaller mobs every time you kill it. It feels more like the grindy sort of combat from late-game BL2 than the fun kinetic shooty combat from 2nd-playthrough BL2. It definitely starts out a bit harder but the hard seems to be the "waste of bullets" variety.\n\nOverall the mechanics are the same as BL2 with some unwelcome additions and the whole thing feels a lot less fast-and-fun than the actual sequel.

The first Mega-StandAlone-AddOn with DLCs ever. We've never had this before!

It's basically BL2 with a new story and some reskinned enemies/cars/weapons/vendormats/etc.\nIt's very hard NOT to see this game as a more-or-less simple cash-grabbing.\n\nThe good:\nI can play as CLAPTRAP! (and still there are some claptrap-bots in the game to laugh about)\nThe new story fills some open plotholes\nFighting is still funny\nBizarre characters and bosses again ("Red and belly sitting in a tree, K I S S....hm, that sounded wrong")\nBalance! No matter how good my weapons are, how far i level or how i spend my skillpoints, most enemies (in level-range of course) are still a kind of challenge, yet i'm seldomly overpowered by any enemy\nNice soundtrack (again)\nCharacters are now addressed as themselves (not only as "vaulthunter")\nThe whole "low-gravity-thing" is quite funny, hopping from pad to pad or using your "jetpack-for-the-poor" to jump around. Yay!\nI can play CLAPTRAP!\n4 New classes, lots of new skills (some of which are just old stuff renamed though *sigh*)\nThe engine's performance is SLIGHTLY better than BL2. Although PhsyX still is a mess. Looks beautiful, drops fps from >140fps to 15fps in an instant. YUCK! Why even include that feature again if it's unplayable even for console-heads?!\n"Nina nurse you!" (will still get annoying after hearing it for the 1230913rd time)\nnew type of weapons, new type of machine (Grinder, nice...another one armed bandit lol), new misc. equipment\nnew tons of stupid (startled/dying)-enemy-one-liners like "i should've known better" and the like. Always love it\nnew bunch of silly humor not taking itself serious at all. Sometimes it's so stupid it becomes clever again. Even the racial-stereotype-dumb-humor like Russian Nina is hillarious. Just don't take it seriously :-)\nYou're in for some nice funny suprises (*cough* Moxxie *cough)\nA weapon that will cuss at you (even calling you the rude version of the female primary genitalia) and your enemies with every shot. Hillarious!\nnew cars with added third dimension element (up/down)\nDid i mention i can play as claptrap?\nEXPLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSIONS! AND LASERSSSSSSsss!\nFlawlessly included borderless windowed AKA non-exlusive fullscreen (still an issue in 2014 *sigh*)\nCooperative online play (what a surprise)\nUltimate-Vault-Hunter-Mode is kinda rewrapped in some Tiny Tina-narration. Not THAT much of new content though, but better than just the same thing again.\nThe bad:\nAs said: Way more of an addon than a fullprice game. Screw you Gearbox! Well played Gearbox! First the myriads of DLCs, now that bugger. With DLCs too, and i bet it'll be even more...We'll see.\nSome missions (or better: the variety of enemies encountered while doing them) become repetitive. Not that it gets boring (if you like the fighting part of BL) but i had wished for some more variety on each map (and overall)\nLow-gravity-induced bugs. Questitems that comfortably fly right into that lava sea over yonder. Nothing game-breaking yet (considering quitting/reloading is not gamebreaking)\nIntroduction/Tutorial (until first major city like sanctuary) seems quite...boring when done the second time (for testing out the new classes)\nThe engine is pretty much the same. Not the slightest graphical enhancement (beside the performance-improvements). Nothing at all. Even stupid AddOns mostly deliver some enhancements to the graphics. Not here.\nIf you expect a damn nice/interesting/clever/brilliant/refreshing story/plot you'd be dissapointed. Even Tiny Tina's Keep-DLC was way above this generic story which is more of a plothole-filler than anything new. But to be fair, it's not totally uninteresting if you played BL1/BL2\nThe story will suck if you have not played BL1/BL2. You'd have no clue who is who or why this or that should be funny or is a reference...It's like taking a book with 600 pages and start at page 400. But if it would have been the other way round, fanboys would have been dissapointed. Hard to please them all.\nNot much settings to really tune the visuals to your machine's capabilities. Should be mandatory for an FPS title, but maybe i'm just picky.\nThis oxygen-thing is quite useless and more annoying than a fun-addition. Mostly you're bombarded with oxygen if you don't need it, but suddenly, while exlporing a secret...Boom! Empty! Meh, gonna search O²...\nOMG i so much hoped for new one-liners in the vendor-bots, like Marcus' but no, it really started to become annoying in BL2 and now it goes on. But at least there's no more Dr.Zed :-)\nWhat really annoys me is the dampened sound if you're in free space. There is no sound at all, why try to be "realistic" there?\nThings that start to annoy really fast are sentences like "attention, breathable atmosphrere!" (woooow thanks dude, nearly missed that one)\nWhy the f..ork are the controls for up/down different when in a vehicle? FOR WHAT REASON?!\nToo few quick-travel points. After a quest is done you basically have to walk the whole fricking way back killing every stupid enemy again. Meh.\nI'm german so i'm expected to say something totally nit-picky: There are SAMs that target me while i'm on the ground. Walking. Ridiculous!\nThe ugly:\nPhsyX. No really Gearbox, are you insane in the membrane? A professional company with a decent budget working together with NVidia to deliver what? THIS? "Best played with NVIDIA"? Are you kidding me? To quote Nina on this: "No, is joke!". Keep it on low (off) *sigh*\nThis goddam console-interface from hell. The design-decision-team should be all punished for that. "Hey why not make this 33-Inventory-Space a scrollable list of, say, 6 items at once?" - "Superb idea, what about not including anything important in one simple clickable screen for these PC-Users with more than 2 buttons too?" - "AWESOME! Nina nurse you!" They have not even try to enhance it slightly...\n"But why do you ♥♥♥♥♥ recommend it then he?" you may ask.\nWell, it's one of the very few (are there even any at all?) FPS that have a slight feeling of RPG and are yet stuffed with funny elements and self-referenced humor just on the sharp edge between being plain dumb and hillarious. On top of that it delivers a nice story that keeps you going, and most side-missions are funny and interesting to do. And on top of that it's a well balanced shooter with nice COOP-abilities.\n\nA) You've played BL1 and BL2:\nLoved them? GO GET IT! Have Claptrap ruin your party, have fun :-)\nThey were just "ok"? Wait for the GOTY.\n\n\nB) You've not played BL1 and BL2 yet:\n\nIf you like FPS mixed with mild RPG-influences (skills, leveling, currencies to buy stuff etc) you should give it a try.\nBut for the love of god (or what's holy to you): Play BL1 & BL2 prior to this. You'll get them for pretty much nothing. BL1 is cool, BL2 is even cooler. If you're in a hurry, just skip the DLCs of both. There's no reason to start with part 3 even though it's called "pre-sequel".\n\nIf you do like FPS, but are more into the "serious" kind like Battlefield or CoD or the likes and don't fancy leveling for a long time or managing resources and inventories (oh you will do)? Stay away. This is probably not what you want to play.\n\ntl;dr:\n9/10, will play again more than once and will buy most DLCs even if smart-me says "NO!".

If you're not a fan, probably nothing here will sway you. I personally love it. The Aussie humour won't appeal to all but I kinda like it. The new weapon-types are pretty cool: laser weapons and cryo elemental damage is well implemented. I like at least something about all the new characters. Athena, Nisha, Wilhelm, Claptrap and Jack (note: at time of writing the final dlc character hasn't been released) all have something going for them, be it tanking, damage or healing. The graphics are pretty timeless due to the nature of the engine and the soundtrack is up to the usual standards. Boss fights are generally fun and the storyline, presentation and dialogue is generally hilarious/appropriately serious but with a few misses. But yes, it does kinda feel like a glorified expansion.\n\nTo summarise, if you love the series, essential. If it's "like" rather than "love", you'll probably like it but it's not essential to your life. If you're not fussed about the series you probably won't be swayed. If you really hate the series, well, nothing will convert you, I don't think ;)","December 8, 2014","true","214.1"," 39 of 71 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","39","71","0","1"

Yes! It's still a fun game, though certain aspects of the game are frusterating or even annoying. Like having to manage how much air you have, having to mange the gravity difference. Driving a bunch of terrible cars. Playing with a bunch of characters who are all mainly situational or just terrible all together. Don't let this make it seem like the game is unplayable, it's still another fun and great Borderlands game! In my opinion Borderlands 2 will still remain the best out of the series. Though your still able to complete endless side quests, complete the main story line and get to KILL STUFF!\n\nDo note: I make this review sound really negative when I do truly enjoy the game. I was just expecting better.\n\nOverall I would give this game a positive review, though there are flaws to the game. It's still fun, I would recommend picking it up on a great sale. 8.5/10","January 20, 2015","true","6.7"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","16","27","4","0"

I'll start with the bad stuff because of that. I'm going to presume you're familiar with Borderlands already. If not, go start with Borderlands 2 the next time it's on sale if you're interested. It'll take you awhile, and when you're done, come back.\n\nIt still has a lot of the Borderlands 2 issues - most weapon drops are vendor trash, there's no way to level up a favorite item, quests are full of pointless trekking back and forth and back again, it still has MMO-style boss grinding tedium in the endgame, some of the jokes are super dumb, weapons are repeated from previous games (this may be good or bad, depending on the weapon), the story doesn't make much sense and is pretty disposable, guns often lack that kinetic "oomph" in terms of sound and SFX, the starting vehicles controls like a brick on springs, etc. The Australian gags may fall flat if you don't know crap about Australia, and the moon areas are sparse and kinda samey as well. It you didn't like previous Borderlands games, this will not change your mind in the slightest.\n\nOn the other hand, moon jumping and slamming is rad and helps use the 3D aspect of the game to actual effect, the classes are more fun and balanced than previous iterations, the humor does have some really cute gags, leveling is linear instead of quadratic, shops now often offer more rare items (and they're leveled to your character properly), you get a lot more dialogue personalized to your class, the second vehicle you get is pretty handy, lasers are fun, ice weapons are way more fun than slag weapons, etc.\n\nIt's not deviating much from the formula, but if you enjoyed the previous Borderlands games this is worth a go-round once it drops in price. It's not as great as it could be, but all Borderlands games are a mix of joy and dissapointment, and this one at least erred towards the joy end of things for me.","November 3, 2014","true","107.6"," 31 of 56 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","31","56","0","0"

(I enjoyed the first and the second game thoroughly).\n\nI would recommend this game. If you enjoyed the 2nd game, it is very similar to that game in regards to play style, weaponry, leveling and difficulty. The new additions in regards to different abilities between our vault hunters, the low gravity, and the ability to grind weaponry were enjoyable editions to the game. Put a good 100 hours into playing 3 of the characters (one of them of course being ClapTrap).\n\nI will say the best part of the game was the story in regards to learning about Jack and why he believes himself to be a hero. Knowing that he will become our villain in the seconds. In addition, I thoroughly enjoyed the ClapTrap DLC and how it tries to explain what happens to our favorite annoying robot between his revolution to the beginning of Borderlands 2.\n\nOnly issue I would say is that there was not much change to the game play. Game play is good, but there are still broken aspects whether being weapon bugs, inability to be able to grind for certain weapons, or easily being destroyed at higher levels by a enemy / horde of enemies on solo when 4+ higher than you. (Part of the exponential difficulty and weapon changes).\n\nFor me this game is still a 9/10.

After a normal playthrough you can up the difficulty and go through it again for even more loot and to reach level 50.

The cell shaded graphics look cool and the four characters are varied enough that you could go through the game with each (hopefully there will be a couple more of these coming too).

I am writing this review after I've reached level 50 with my character and completed almost every quest so I guess I can judge the game as fairly as possible.\n\n// 1 //\nFor those who expect too many changes, sorry. This game is very similar to Borderlands 2. Engine, graphics, humor and other key features are very similar to BL2. However, that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. Those who loved Borderlands 2 are definitely going to atleast like Pre-Sequel, if not to love it as well.\n\n// 2 //\nIn my opinion, the story was solid, it wasn't too epic, but it was enjoyable. It filed the gaps between BL1 and BL2. Gameplay was amazing, I absolutely enjoyed every aspect of it, especially the low gravity, butt-slams, cryo guns, laser guns, moon surface and much more. They did a great job on this. Soundtrack was solid, but it felt a bit calm in many parts of the maps. Too calm maybe, I sometimes didn't even hear it over the shooting and EXPLOSIONS. The game just keeps doing what Borderlands 2 did great and keeps improving that. Levels are much more balanced, combat is balanced, gameplay improved, etc.\n\n// 3 //\nTo not make this review too long, here are my pros and cons about Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel.\n+ Gameplay\n+ Story\n+ Graphics, aesthetics\n+ Atmosphere\n+ Shooter elements, rpg elements\n+ Leveling up, progression of your character\n+ 4 player coop\n+ Laser guns of course :D\n\n- Repetitive? (for some people, this is a negative thing)\n- Lack of originality\n- Lazy re-skinned models of guns from BL2\n- Soundtrack, not bad, but could be improved much more\n- PhysX, doesn't work smoothly (60+fps) on majority of high-end computers\n- No button to autmatically refill your ammo! (ha-ha, iz joke)\n\nThat's about it, the game doesn't have many negative aspects, nothing that would ruin the game.\nFor a new player to BL series, those negatives won't probably even matter.\n\nMy score would be 8/10 for this game. It's great, fun and enjoyable, especially with good friends, but could have been much better. It had a lot of potential.

When I decided to buy the pre-sequel, my expectations were the same with Borderlands 1 and 2. I was craving some more Borderlands grinding, cool mobs and fun story/dialogs and boy... The Pre-Sequel surely delivered.\n\nFirst, the good stuff:\n•	Everything you loved from the previous games grinding, mobs, clever dialogs, good level design, all that jazz… they’re still fun.\n•	The moon adds a new aspect to the game, new mechanics like O2 levels and low gravity. You always have to be aware of your O2 level when you are in a vacuumed area.  Low gravity is really fun. Jumping puzzles are cleverly hidden and feels fresh coming from Borderlands 2.\n•	There are more guns with different combinations, like railguns and LASERS!!!!1!1.\n•	The new Vault Hunters are more likeable and they are written better. They have some kind of character now but still I encourage you the buy the doppelganger DLC to play as Jack. He is one of my favorite Vault Hunter, ever (might be after Brick).\n•	Handsome Jack’s story explains a lot from the second game and makes you love the previous Vault Hunters even more.\n\nNow the bad stuff:\n•	Some missions are still unbearably booooring. “You have to go here. Oh the door is locked? You need to power it the door. Oh, if you want to power it, you need to find the engine... Damn, to go to the engine, you need a key… To get the key you need the kill this boss.” FML!!!!!111!!!!1\n•	If you don’t like the Borderlands’ humor, nature, sense, personality… This game won’t convince you and won’t change anything…\n•	The rare currency is changed to Moonstones from Eridium. And its color is light blue. Guess what is also white blue… THE WHOLE ♥♥♥♥ING MOON. So whenever a moonstone is dropped, it’s very hard to see. But thank god they buffed the drop so moonstones drop far more than Eridium.\n•	The new vehicle, hovercraft, Stingray handles like ♥♥♥♥. Plain horse ♥♥♥♥. I don’t know why they even tried to squeeze it in the game.\n\nAt the end, the game doesn’t fall short and delivers a great Borderlands experience. If you liked the previous games and you’re a hardcore fan, the game justifies a full price. But you just like to play it from time to time… wait for a real discount like %50-%75 then buy the game. You won’t regret it.\n","February 3, 2015","true","27.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

This is the best set of PCs yet.  None of them are useless for once.  All of them are fun to play, with more than one correct build.\n\nUnfortunately, you can only play those characters in this game.  Which means I've stopped playing them.\n\nThe presequal's maps are trying and failing to make use of the (not actually that much fun) low grav movement mechanics.  It ends up just making maps hard to navigate.  And the quest's have you do a terrible amount of backtracking.  I hate walking sim crap.\n\nThe jokes suck.  Maybe I just don't get Australian humor.  I was horribly let down.\n\nThe best part of 2 was Handsome Jack being a ♥♥♥♥.  This whole, let's follow Jack's fall to the darkside thing isn't working.  He sucks as a sympathetic character.  He's just not interesting.  And it doesn't do a good job of telling that story anyway since he just goes nuts all in one scene.  There isn't this gradual fall like they were trying to let on.\n\nI was also pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off by the fact that they decided to make money a scarce resource.  I've played several hundred hours of Borderlands 1 and 2.  This is the first time I've ever ran out of money.  Until I started picking up guns just to sell (which is some tedious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t) I actually ran out of money to buy ammo.  This is a huge departure from the previous games, where money wasn't actually that important.  And I don't think this new method is fun.\n\nThis is the worst Borderlands of the series.  I just went back to playing Borderlands 2.  My verdict is, wait until this gets very cheap before you let curiosity get the better of you.  It's worth 5 bucks just to find out how far you can get before quitting in bewilderment at what they've done.

After playing both the first and second games in the series, this one is definitely different. This game changes quite a lot from the first two. First, SPACE! This game takes place in, [SPOILER!], Space. More specifically, the moon and on the giant space station from Borderlands 2(BL2), Helios. So, that being said, the map isn't terribly large. It's definitely not as large as BL2's map, but being that BL2 was Supposed to have the biggest map, that's to be expected. Now, a lot of complaints I see about it is the low gravity and platforming aspects. First off, the low gravity feels floaty but it does Not restrict combat, it makes it fun by letting you get kills in the air. Trust me, losing the fun low gravity happens a few times in the game and you won't enjoy the loss of mobility that low gravity gives you. As for the platforming aspect, you run and jump. I guess that's platforming, but there's not many other ways to get around on foot to begin with. I've also noted that a few people complain about the slamming feature being required to progress, which is not true in the least. I have only played the main campaign, not the dlc, but there's only two quests I can remember that require it, and they're side quests. Alright, so now that those "problems" are cleared up, let's get back to the good parts that I love about it. One of my favorite changes to the game is the change from level 5 to level 3 to get your first action point. It doesn't seem like a big change, but that's two extra points to go towards the skill trees. They also added a new type of gun, lasers. I can sum them up really easy: either they're awesome or they aren't. The story is kind of short but fun. I like that there's varied voice actors, or at least varied accents. There's some Australian, some British, and of course the normal American. The story is interesting, albeit a bit short, it shows a different perspective to the character Handsome Jack which is what it was supposed to do. The game is just enough like the old ones to make you want to play and new enough to keep you playing. The price, I will admit, is a bit high. Personally, I was able to catch it on a cheap sale, and I recommend you do the same. I don't feel $40 is worth it, (but really, I hardly feel any game is worth more than $20) but for $15 or $20 you'll feel feel that it was a great buy.","November 15, 2015","true","62.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

I actually returned to Borderlands 1 with a friend or two and had more fun with that than playing through this game.  Borderlands 2 is seemingly better with better dialogue from what I understand - go play that instead if you want to play Borderlands with a more active player base than the first game.

It is by no means a bad game! I actually do like it. But it suffers from one MASSIVE flaw...\n\nThe Pre-Sequel is NOT anywhere as good as Borderlands 2.\n\nThe two factors that made Blands 2 so awesome were it's entertaining story and it's characters which were (for the most part) entertaining to play. The Pre-Sequel does not deliver in both these areas. The story is only okay, and the playable characters are fairly under-whelming, even compared to the original Borderlands game. So I was tempted to recommend maybe playing this game BEFORE Blands 2, but even that leaves a sour taste in my mouth. The fact is, Blands 2 is cheaper. You can purchase it with it's major expansions for less than this game and it has TONS more content, all much more enjoyable.\n\nSo who would I recommend this game to? The only players who come to mind would be the Borderlands fans (like me) but those gamers should have already played (and been disappointed by) this game. So who else is there? Maybe, just maybe, the very casual gamer who is taking thier sweet time getting to this game, but even them I'd recommend playing all the expansions for Borderlands 2 first, and then probably just starting yet another character in that game (or the original Borderlands) instead.\n\nAnd just FYI, I do own two copies of this game now. I originally purchased on console to play co-op with my son, and now have it on PC because it's the gaming system I prefer. And I will play even more of this game, but I just can't in good conscience recommend anyone else to do the same.\n\nSo in conclussion, my feeling is if you haven't purchased this game already, then there's really no need to at this point. Either play Borderlands 2 (and it's expansions!) or just wait for Borderlands 3 instead.","July 13, 2015","false","36.8"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

On the one side, it's a *fairly* solid FPS shooter with loot in abundance, some good humour and great co-op gaming. One that I am sure you will enjoy playing with a few friends. On the other hand, it feels like an expensive Borderlands 2 DLC and a blatant cash grab (they will be bringing out MORE DLC for this one too, if you are so inclined).\n\nConsAll the little annoyances and bugs from number 2 got carried over, without so much as a look at getting them fixed or changed. I have already experienced sound randomly disappearing for no reason, only to come back after I die (a bug that plagued the previous game as well). I have also had an NPC glitch on the tutorial mission, making it impossible to finish without exiting the game and coming back in.\n\nThen there is the horrendous amount of back tracking through the same old levels - surely they could just add more fast travel locations to the game? How about some form of teleport device - since we seem to be able to constantly cheat death and respawn nearby anyway? The menus are still horrendous to navigate - a remnant of it being a console port, no doubt. Boring fetch-this and go-there quests seem as abundant as ever too, I really wish there was a bit more depth to the multitude of side-quests.\n\nThe new low gravity / O2 mechanic is really just a gimmick and does nothing to improve the game. All it seems to do is make for bunny-hopping gun-fights. The classes are also not that interesting. Claptrap is a completely useless character in single or co-op, Wilhelm is basically Axton from the previous game and the last two characters are nothing special either.\n\nBorderlands games have always advertised themselves as a fusion of FPS and RPG, but I was kind of hoping a little more of the RPG side of things would be brought into the games as time went on. This is sadly not the case. Customisation is limited to poor skill trees and throw-away skins that do nothing but change the basic colours of your character. The bad-♥♥♥ system is a neat idea, but never really seems to do much for you and I can't help but wonder if more could have also been done here as well.\n\nThe humour and general feel of Borderlands 2 is here - so it is really just more of the same. This is its biggest problem. It brings nothing new to the table and looks and feels like you are playing Borderlands 2. Most of the points I have mentioned so far could be forgiven in BL2, but 2 years later, to bring out this "expansion pack" and try palming it off as a separate game without addressing any of its predecessors issues is just a bit much.\n\nProsMoving on to the positives: it's more Borderlands, which surely cannot be a bad thing in itself. It's still a great co-op game that gets better with more people playing. The graphics look as good as ever and it has Handsome Jack before he was Handsome Jack - who was always one of my favourite characters in the last game. The story seems acceptable but nothing ground-breaking. It is nice to see previous characters making a come-back to fill in some gaps.\n\nThe game is still great fun to play co-op, where a full-team of vault hunters is much more enjoyable than wondering around alone. The guns and loot is as crazy and fun as ever. There is also a new laser-class weapon, which is a welcome addition. "Slag" seems to have been replaced with "Cryo" weapons, which is a welcome addition, since Slag weapons became more and more essential as you levelled up in number 2 - and limited your options.\n\nSummarySo, to summarise, it's an overpriced, underdeveloped slog through similar territory - a cash-grab by lazy developers. If you can see past this and enjoyed Borderlands 2 then that will be of no consequence and you can ignore most of the cons in this review. If you, like me, expected more, then you have come to the wrong place and should wait for Borderlands 3 instead. Still, this is Gearbox afterall - who gave us Duke Nukem Forever and Colonial Marines - I guess I shouldn't have expected too much from them. It's a fairly decent game that will keep diehard fans of the franchise happy, but you can't help but wonder what more could have been done.\n\nMy Jimbo Rating on this game will differ based on two important factors, shown below.\n\nIf you wanted more from the new Borderlands game than a lazy, copy-paste clone:\nJimbo Rating: 5/10 - "Not Recommended"\n\nIf you simply wanted more Borderlands 2 and are a diehard fan that has cash to throw at the lazy devs:\nJimbo Rating: 7/10 - "Recommended"\n\nFor me, this game falls in the first category, making it a 5/10.","October 30, 2014","false","24.5"," 60 of 113 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","60","113","0","0"

The story also is very goodish by that i mean right up intil the last quarter of the game the story lachs good characters, story and interesting missions percinally my favourite part was the end which is so good i dont want to spoil it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/machineageinc/recommended/261640/","machineageinc","machineiv","http://steamcommunity.com/id/machineageinc/","155 products in account","TL;DR: It's not quite Borderlands 2, but it's still a very good game.\n\nThe writing's not quite as tight. There are some spots that seem to be written by someone that laughed at Anthony Burch's work in Borderlands 2, but didn't really get it, and tried to emulate that. A lot of the writing's solid. Some is downright hilarious. But some falls flat on its face, and that's sad.\n\nI haven't had any moments with the writing that really shook me. "Because that's what heroes do..." in BL2 shook me to the core. This game just about hits those levels. In fact, I think I didn't get the full value of Jack's arc until the second play through. Unfortunately, some of the quests actually devalue that arc quite a bit, and invalidate some of his most important choices from a ludonarrative perspective. These are fetch quest style problems, which can be a problem in any game, but Borderlands 2 managed to make those work well. In Pre-Sequel, they betray the urgency in fundamental ways that damage the narrative.\n\nThe level design hits higher points, and lower points. Some of the level design is really quite fun. They way some of the fights are arranged, it's a beautiful chaos and keeps you moving. These moments are the absolute best thing Borderlands has done in this regard. However, those are contrasted by entire areas that are rife with ♥♥♥♥ design.\n\nThe Hyperion base is a huge example of ♥♥♥♥ design. The game focuses heavily on the new elements, the air, the stomp, and the double jump. The Hyperion base is a very large segment of the late game play, and it makes all those things completely invalid. There's unlimited air, there's full gravity so double jumps don't work, and stomps are useless. By the time I finally get out of that section of the game, I forget about them, and have to essentially relearn those mechanics. That stinks.\n\nTrue Vault Hunter Mode is... really close to amazing. The problem with the replay modes in BL2 is, they tend to ruin what makes the gameplay fun for me. You can't play balls-out, chaotic. You can't shape the encounters with well-placed sniping at the beginning of a fight. Higher level bosses become pedantic exercises in equipment and skill allocation. I hate that.\n\nIn Pre-Sequel, it's the same thing as the first play through, only more. It's fun, it's hectic. I don't feel overly stressed, just challenged. My sniping stuff works great. I can rush up to enemies and unload. It's very much "Borderlands". Bravo. However, they didn't balance all the game this well, and where they didn't, it suffers immensely. One of the first major bosses is almost impossible in True Vault Hunter Mode, unless you're highly specced out to fight him. You can't level grind to get past him, because he's so early on, you don't have any good grind areas available. There's no opportunities to go find the right loot to make it work, either. So if you get stuck there, you're basically ♥♥♥♥ed unless you finagle getting different equipment into that save file using creative multiplayer ♥♥♥♥ery. ♥♥♥♥ that.\n\nThis goes doubly so when one of your character choices favors non-elemental weapons heavily, and that boss all but requires an elemental weapon to take down. Sad.\n\nGender dynamics? A++. So good in that regard. Mr. Torgue's friend zone joke was brilliantly constructed.\n\nI love hearing the protagonists banter back and forth. I love hearing them react to each others' class skills. I love hearing their different interactions with the NPCs. I worry this is going to make adding new characters to the game that much harder. But who knows?\n\nIce weapons are kind of cool I guess? I don't like them much, outside of shield effects. But then again, Nisha's by far my favorite character, and she heavily favors non-elemental weapons.\n\nStomping is fun. It's a shame they remove the capacity for it in what's probably the single biggest segment of the game.\n\nClaptrap's kind of weird as a character. I don't think the benefits of his random effects are comparable to the reliable effects of the other characters, which is sad.\n\nNisha is absurd. Once she gets levelled up quite a bit, she becomes ridiculous and over-the-top, in ways I've never seen Borderlands characters get. I like this a lot.\n\nAthena is a fun, solid character. She's got a good range of abilities, and her special supports playing without cover, which I'm a huge fan of.\n\nWilhelm is similarly fun. I like that his support drones kind of take the best parts of playing Axton and Roland, but gives them more complex strategic value and diversity.\n\nIt's a very solid game. In a lot of ways, it's not quite Borderlands 2. But in a lot of ways, it's better.","November 1, 2014","true","122.5"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","18","32","0","0"

There are New guns and combat mechanics, which are a novelty at best; lasers, double jump, butt stomping. Looks great, sounds good, if not being buggy. The Pc and npc's are very good shame the game tanks so hard. The season pass is not worth it either. Best class was for Me CL4P-TP.\n\nThat is where the good points end!\n\nGravity jumping Weeee. only to be shot when 3 miles in the air. killed fall back down, then attempt to get a 2nd wind.\nThen we have flying loot due to anti gravity. When loot is this rare you do not want it flying off in to the Cosmos or Lava flows. Grinder was a way to deal with the weak loot system.\n\nThis instalment of the franchise, even took the shine off Borderlands 2 for several weeks. Which gave me time for quiet reflection. After many hours of reflecting, realised this was a whole lot of Tosh. 2K Purely just cashed in on the good name that was Borderlands 2. This game is pitiful in the ways you'd not expect it to be.\n\nYou'll die a lot more, mostly due to falling into space or lava or glitches in the level.\n\nNever has one been promised so much, only to not have it delivered. Shock horror. "Sell the Sizzle not the Sausage" business model was used here.\n\nTo sum up; if you have never played any Borderlands games do yourself a "Solid" Buy Borderlands 2 it is better in every way. Afterall you are Worth it!\n\nPre-ordering off 2K / Gearbox is now over for me.","November 30, 2014","false","58.5"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","19","34","0","6"

(which i'm really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about them nerfing. it might just be me but i really don't see the point in nerfing anything that makes the game easier to play if the only competitive option you really have is duelling over loot with your friends.)\n\nthis is in vast contrast to butt slams and cryo damage which is pretty universally satisfying. (of course, cryo only goes for if you have a high chance of freezing people but that should be a given for any elemental damage.) i especially find it fun to butt slam someone and watch the rag doll physics kick in as they fly off into the void nothingness of space. it's also fun to freeze someone before slamming your ♥♥♥ on them so they break into pieces. what's hilarious is slamming into a huge group of enemies telling them to shut the ♥♥♥♥ up and they freeze to death. they're little additions that make the game a bit more fun in some parts, but still overall not much of a difference from bl2.\n\nthere are a few more things aside from the slow fire rate on lasers that make the combat system a little less satisfying though i gotta say. flying enemies are annoying. rakks were annoying in the last game, and now you have to deal with the bootleg rakks and ♥♥♥♥ing bandits with jetpacks. 'who's shooting at me i can't find them oh it's because they're floating great'. while the immediate instinct is to kill them while they're in the air, again, it's pretty annoying because whatever loot they might drop you have no choice to miss out on because it falls into the many voids of this space place. there are a lot of drops you end up missing, actually. it's usually not weapons, but more likely money or ammo that just floats away after you open any box. but this is zero-gs so i guess that's how things behave in that atmosphere? hell if i know\n\nloot also feels a lot less...invigorating? that word sounds weird to use, let's just say exciting. loot chests feel less exciting to open. odds are what they have is ♥♥♥♥ and you can just buy something better in a vending machine. it feels pretty insulting that i'm supposed to be kind of adventuring through the moon looking for these loot chests that have these awesome legendary weapons when i'm only a level 5 and whaddya know there's an orange weapon for sale right here. (adding insult to injury you obviously can't afford these things at these levels like what the ♥♥♥♥)\n\nokay last but not least i guess i'll talk about the plot(?). i'm not saying that fps games always have to have this extraordinary plot that'll break my heart, but what a disappointment. i'm not spoiling anything don't worry, kiddos. just saying that the ending was super abrupt. the game felt a lot shorter than bl2. i'm guessing it wasn't but it just felt like it was. it probably just does because in bl2 i was in a 3-player campaign while in pre-sequel i was by myself. i dunno. it was also pretty annoying to hear so many australian accents. i don't have a beef with australians, it just feels pretty stupid to be like 'remember us? we're 2k australia we're the ones that made this game this is our thing we did it with crayons and elmers glue aren't we cool?'.\n\nat the end of the day, i'm just gonna say what everyone else is gonna say.\ndon't buy it\nnot now\nnot at full price\nwait for it to go on sale for like 30 bucks then by all means but until then keep playing the dlc in bl2 unless you're super impatient and you feel like you absolutely have to buy it asap then fine waste your allowance don't say i didn't warn you","January 26, 2015","true","274.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The difficulty curve is really messed up, the maps are rather poorly designed and there are not enough fast travel stations to make the gameplay fluid. These things added together sometimes inspires unnecessary frustration and will probably kill the fun for some.\n\nThat being said the humor we have come to expect is still there and most of the dialog is entertaining. Since much of the humor is clearly colored by the australian development team it might go over the head of some.\n\nIn short: Borderlands the pre-sequel is not of the same quality as either of the previous games, neither in gameplay or humor, but it fills a hole in the storyline and lets you play with some entertaining new characters.\n\nI recomend getting it on sale as it is not worth the full price.","June 18, 2015","true","23.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game is really well-done and here is a list of why I recommend this:\n\n1) Great number of missions\n\n2) Bosses are fair\n\n3) All six new Action Skills and their accompanying Skill Trees are useful (my personal faves are Claptrap's "VaultHunter.EXE", which mimics the six skills from BL2 (then adds some like Pirate Ship Mode and Laser Inferno which includes a giant disco ball), and Aurelia's "Cold as Ice" (she sends out a shard of ice that homes in on enemies. Press the action key/button all you like until the duration runs out. It's f^&*ing awesome))\n\n4) The new Cryo element is fun to use and easy to learn and utilize (it also acts similarly to Slag from Borderlands 2)\n\n5) And the Glitched weapons (found in Claptastic Voyage) are neat and really useful","June 18, 2015","true","50.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

They made it so you need OZ kits to harness oxygen to breath. You can also use the oxygen as a jetpack to glide around and jump higher. They also added ground pounds where you can smash into enemies after jumping into the air. They added a few new weapon types too.

Nisha, Wilhelm, Claptrap, Aurelia, and Jack are all such solid classes. Athena is okay, but in my opinion she's the least interesting. Anyways, gameplay is a just what you would expect from a Borderlands game: shoot the ♥♥♥♥ out of everything and get tons of loot. Also, if you love the lore of Borderlands than this is a great game for you\n\n\nAs a die hard Borderlands fan, this game hyped me up to extremes. I bought two copies and I honestly was a LITTLE let down. Just a little bit. I'll make a scrambled up list for my own pros and cons for anybody who shares my thoughts. I've bought all of the dlcs so I can try and review them too.\n\nBASE GAME:\n\npros\n\n- Solid story, it adds a lot to the world they've created.\n- Motha. Fuggin. BUTTSLAM? Fun as hell dudes.\n- The Oz kits and air system is a cool add, easy to control like it doesn't exist, but I can appreciate it anyways.\n-No gravity, you spend the whole time on the moon. When I go back to playing Borderlands 2, I immediately miss flying through the air.\n- The game is well-optimized. I remember it being pretty buggy here and there at launch but they resolved it quickly.\n- You get to learn more about Jack, since he's your boss. Same with Nisha, Wilhelm, Claptrap (especially in his dlc) and it introduces new characters like Timothy Lawrence (Jack's body double) And Aurelia Hammerlock, the sister of Alister Hammerlock. It also reintroduces old characters from previous games, such as Nakayama. Jack's #1 fanboy.\n- Funny and super amusing dialogue from the characters you play as! I'm so happy they have playable characters that can now talk, and NPCs all react differently for each character thanks to their personalities.\n- If you're a gun nut.... yeah. This game.\n- Jack's body double. Best. Character. EVER. (Same with Aurelia)\n\nCons\n\n- The game raises more questions than answers. I'm guessing they are gonna do a lot in Borderlands 3 though, this definitely hypes for the third.\n- A lot of the bosses are forgettable. They all seem to have very weak qualities that sets them apart from another. Borderlands 2 had amazing unique qualities to their bosses.\n- I think this game tries a little too hard to be Borderlands 2, it tries to be wacky, and zany... but the execution left a lot to be desired.\n-There aren't many character depths, usually when you meet an NPC that's all you get. Borderlands 2 had a lot of awesome npcs and characters that everyone fell in love with, you just don't get that in this game as much.\n-The only memorable characters this game introduced would be Janey, Pickles, Felicity. That's about all I can remember off the top of my head.\n- I compare this game a lot to Borderlands 2, which probably isn't fair, but compared to the second game, this game's quests are lackluster.\n- Wilhelm's class is kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, if you're looking to play someone like Axton. His trees leave a lot to be desired. He was my main for a while and he is WEAK as hell. I quickly switched to Jack' though and don't regret it.\n\n\n\nCLAPTASTIC VOYAGE:[/b]\n\npros\n\n- It breathes SO much life into the game.\n- It's fun, mesmerizing for a dlc based around CLAPTRAP.\n- Brightly colored digital world, you get to see a lot of cool stuff happening and it's just hilarious.\n- The whole DLC requires you to travel inside of Claptrap. It sounds 'wtf' at first but the moment you dive right in, you are guaranteed to have tons of fun.\n- It's comparable to Tiny Tina's dlc for the second game. It definitely isn't at that godly on a level, but this game needed a good dcl and Claptastic is just that.\n- That end cinematic though. It made me love Claptrap. This game will probably turn everybody to loving that stupid robot.\n- Great dialogue, awesome soundtrack.\n- YOU GET TO REVISIT ZONES FROM THE FIRST AND SECOND GAMES!\n- This DLC also answers a lot of questions instead of raising them.\n\nIT'S WORTH THE MONEY, TRUST ME.\n\ncons\n\n-Last boss fight is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and I know it's gonna be hard when I do it on UTHM. pray for me\n\n\nThe Holodome Onslaught:[/b]\n\nNo.\n\nDon't buy it. It's awful. The only semi-decent things to come out of this stupid dlc are the skins I guess.\n\nBasically you just fight in a big dome, that's it. There is literally nothing to it. It's not the fun kinda fighting, either. The area is TOO big and you have to kill everybody to go to the next level. It's long, tedious, and the rewards aren't worth it. You get some audio logs from Axton and Gaige but that's all that it brings to the table. Awful DLC. Just look up all the audio logs and you'll be up to date on what's going on with them.","March 23, 2015","true","93.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game is just as good as the previous two. The class are fun, the story is engaging, and the weapons are just as great. It works nearly identically to Borderlands 2 as far as gameplay goes, with the exception of the additional oxygen feature.\n\nI thought at first that the oxygen feature would be tedious, but it's honestly not that big of an issue. There's no micromanaging involved, and oxygen areas are easy to come by. The butt bounce it provides is tons of fun, especially with an elemental Oz kit, and the option of much-quicker resurrection of teammates using your oxygen supply is invaluable in a team setting.\n\nThere were only a few things I found wrong with the game. The soundtrack isn't nearly as good as the previous titles' soundtracks. Though I haven't yet finished the game, there doesn't seem to be as wide as range of areas to explore, especially compared to Borderlands 2 and its DLCs, but the story is interesting enough to make up for that for me. It's interesting to see the character development that Jack goes through on his descent toward Handsome Jack. The addition of Cryo-- or ice elemental-- weapons is fantastic as well, especially when pared with the DLC Aurelia Hammerlock class, which has a whole skill trees devoted to Cryo damage.\n\nOverall, if you loved the previous Borderlands games, this one is a great addition to your collection. Don't pass it up, especially if you can snag it during a sale.","December 4, 2015","true","44.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Its not as good as borderlands 2 which you can play repeatedly and not get bored of, mainly because this game lacks a exciting story. The story could be amazing but I feel how Jack becomes evil is sort of rushed and not well executed, for example, it would have been much better if Jack had done good deeds but then for the player to realise these were for bad intentions. The maps, I hate to say, are too big and arent filled with enough stuff to keep the game exciting.\nHowever, there are still some funny parts, especially how the 'story' is spoken to different vault hunters on each playthrough and some references are funny. Also it is a borderlands game so it still has the slightly maniac and psychotic playthrough with the addition of finally seeing the eridians!\nIts a good game, I would recommend it, but for most, this is one time play game so dont spend too much money on it!

But gameplay wise, being on the moon and using those Oz kits make it so you can  fly further, jump higher and do butt slams on enemies, it is a big new feature and I like it's in there.\n\nNow I have completed the first playthrough with every character (except the newest one) and gotten the Lawbringer to 60 an wilhelm to 50, but I still don't get that kind feel like I did in Borderlands 2 each time I finished a playthrough, don't feel like I've really done anything productive and I don't really know what to do next. That brings me to the dialogue, honestly the dialogue can get quite repetitive and annoying cause you can't skip it and some are pretty long (1 to mention is the side mission where you help nurse Nina find a lover and each time you found 1 you had to wait through the dialogue then pick up the stupid flowers afterwards, many times I started making my way to the next point then realized I forgot the flowers.)\n\nNow the DLC, so far the DLC has honestly.... been quite crap, 2 playable characters and 1 level upgrade with a slaughter dome thing. and the season pass promised 4 DLC, 3 have already come out, and on the page is says "all DLC will be released before October 2015, It's just February and they already released almost all of the ones they promised from their season pass. I really hope the last one is an actual playable DLC with a story (and I have heard it's going to involve something about Claptrap)\n\nThe 4 new playable characters in the game, Wilhelm, Nisha, Claptrap and Athena all have these brand new kind of abilities that are all cool and unique in their own way and also how all the skill trees can effect all kinds of things, like with wilhems you can slowly make him into more of a robot the more you level up, with Nisha in the bottom of the middle tree you can dual wield any pistols you hold in your hands, with Athena there's not much there but you can make your shield do all sorts of cool stuff, and then Claptrap is kind of that main co op character, there is kind of an entire tree just for co op and at the bottom of 1 of them there is a skill where you can high five a player and get some extra stats for some time. Also with the DLC characters making them 6  now with Handsome Jack and Aurelia it makes it so you can play the story way more times and get all these cool new things. (but honestly I'm not a big fan of Aurelia's skill, I just find it kinda meh tbh)\n\nThe story in this game is pretty interesting, it shows how Handsome jack got to power and how he became a crazy psychopath,  and I do think this game does actually have alot to do with Borderlands 3  That is the guardians of the vault, as you saw in the end scene of the game where the alien looking creature said they would need all the vault haunters they could get cause some mass force is coming, or something like that\n\nThough it may seem like I'm kinda just crapping on the game, I do actually really like the game and I'm a bit of a sucker for Borderlands and these kinds of farming games. I probably will keep playing this game, but probably not as much as I played Borderlands 2 cause I just reeeally loved Borderlands 2 and could play that for hours without getting tired of it.\n\nOverall, if you are a big fan of the Borderlands series, I would recommend it but be advised the dialogue in like the first 2-3 playthroughs are cool but after that gets kinda annoying. Also if you are looking for a good game to just chill with your friends I definitely recommend this game because this game seems to kinda involve a lot of cool co-op experience at to be honest kinda feels like this game was just made for co-op, though the story is educational for the hard core borderlands fans.","January 30, 2015","true","140.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lexifox/recommended/261640/","lexifox","Finding Namor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lexifox/","297 products in account","A recommendation, but not the strongest one.\n\nThe characters are much better designed and balanced, boss battles are more interesting, the new weapon type and element are fantastic, the memes are reduced, vending machines are worth looking at, the eridium analogue is easier to obtain, and UVHM is much better balanced. The writing is about on quality with BL2, for better or worse, and the new characters are divisive at best. Unique NPC dialog based on your character is also long overdue. The Claptrap DLC is also some of the best gameplay in the series. This game's "pink" weapons are more easily obtained than BL2's Seraph weapons, and much more interesting. For the players who refuse to Gib, the Grinder provides a fantastic option for turning their terrible legendary drops into something more interesting without farming.\n\nOn the subject of DLC, the game is free from the cosmetic skin nickel and diming that BL2 suffered from, and the Season Pass is much less confusing in terms of what you get. The only DLC that it doesn't contain is the Shock Drop Slaughter Pit (for some reason), a location that provides standard slaughter arena fare. There's a lack of expansion compared to the four major DLCs of BL2, though the Claptastic Voyage is easily better than all but three, and a strong contender for best DLC of the series.\n\nThe biggest strikes against the game is the level design and Fast Travel location. There are many places that are too large, or send you back and forth without any quick travel options. There are several locations in dire need of Fast Travel (Veins of Helios and Subsubconscious stand out). The oxygen system isn't bad, though it does lead to some floaty combat that can be annoying. For the completionists, several of the badass challenges are completely awful and give you only a single chance per playthrough to complete. On a nitpicky note, the game really needs to stop censoring its non-robotic swearing.\n\nTPS is a good game, one I've happily invested over 100 hours in. I wouldn't call the game better than BL2, though the two certainly belong in the same room. The game is very much worth picking up and playing, though the recommendation only becomes particularly strong when the game is on Steam sale. Just be sure to grab the Season Pass, for the aforementioned Claptastic DLC and two solid characters.","November 14, 2015","true","153.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Does the game have a few issues? Sure. Does it make it not worth playing? No. I feel like if you really enjoy the series it's really worth playing through. You get to play characters from BL2 that you otherwise would have no clue what their whole backstory was - Nisha and Wilhelm especially (not going to lie, Wilhelm made me have a feels moment when you realize there is nothing human left about him... even if he didn't care).\n\nAll in all, if you've played the other games and enjoy them - give this a try. With it being on the summer sale right now you have no reason not to! Great deal if you get it with the season pass.

And, luckily, I WAS WRONG.\n\nSTORY (no spoilers)\nIn this game you discover what happened before Borderlands 2, but after Borderlands 1. The reason I put the sentence that way is because it is way more connected to Borderlands 2. You discover how Handsome Jack turned from a low-level guy to a leader. You will see some familiar faces while you do it.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nJust like with previous games, this is a Role-Playing Shooter. So, you can choose which character you want, which skills your character will have, and which swella items will your character use.\n\nGRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCE]\nThis game, just like BL2 and BL1 uses cel-shading. It's a specifc graphic style that makes everything look cartoon-ish. Not in a bad way, though. It performs really well, even on my old-♥♥♥ 2007 PC (and my gtx 960 pc)\n\nCONCLUSION\nAny Borderlands fan needs to get this game. If you haven't played Borderlands before, I recommend you play BL1 and BL2 first. If not, then just BL2.","March 27","true","38.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I cannot recommend anyone buying this game unless it went on sale for $10.\n\nYes, bugs and glitches can be fixed and maybe some of them have but it wouldn't change the way the game feels.

If you like Borderlands buy the game and have endless hours of fun with no gravity, laser guns and four new interesting and unique characters. You play through one character to get the feel and then you move onto the next and then the next.

Its awesome to watch Handsome Jack's character development through the story. The player you decide to play even gets unique dialogue to say in this game at certain parts some characters are smart asses some are funny its a welcome addition as now your character isn't completely like a killing machine. In short the story is pretty fantastic if you played Borderlands 2 if not go play Borderlands 2 you'll see why in a minute.\n\nThe characters and skill trees\nAs i said above the character's dialogue is perfect and a welcome addition but the choice of characters is pretty cool as well. You will get to select out of 4 familiar vault hunters or 6 with the DLC as much i would love to sit here tell you the most OP builds for them all i'm just going to say this: They are all good it is not like Borderlands 2 where there is a character or 2 are terrible at the end game *Cough* Axton *Cough* they are all good and can pretty much succeed at anypart of the game some are still better than others but its not like Borderlands 2 in the fact there are harder characters to play than others. The skill trees which is the most important of the characters are the best yet in Borderlands. It makes you wish they would maybe do some kind merge with TPS and Borderlands 2 and let you play as TPS characters and vice versa. Anyway back on topic the skills actually synergize well with other skills even if different trees and characters. Picking a character and leveling him up and working on builds is really fun in TPS.\n\nLoot and rarites\nThis is where my review starts to get a negative and you might be thinking how could this be bad after that well i said at the start that i am writing this a really big Borderlands fan as i am, i have played every Borderlands for countless hours on console and PC. Which leads to the huge problem of TPS: Legendaries are mostly returning or reskins with slight different mechanies. Although some of you might be happy that there is no Norfleet therefore shamfleeting or Unkempt harold. This is still a problem but this issue has been somewhat resolved with the new DLC claptastic voyage which adds new legendaries and a new rarity called glitch weapons but if you're not buying the DLC then don't bother about this sentence.\n\nEndgame Scaling and Farming\nLets start with another positive scaling is heaps better in TPS and doesn't go into terriblely unfun levels like Borderlands 2. Scaling is better in TPS enough said but farming took a hit when the game released with no respawnable bosses. Although this has been resolved with a patch it was a problem and took a bit too long to fix which is why most Borderlands fans are playing Borderlands 2.\n\nDLC\nThe DLC packs for TPS are pretty good besides Holodome which is terrible and should only be bought if you are level 60 and want to be level 70. The other packs like the Doppelganger pack and Baroness pack are good but not %100 necessary at all. The only DLC you really need if you are playing casually or want more endgame is Claptastic Voyage which is one of the best DLC's i have ever played its packed with new content and a raid boss although people say not technically i think the last boss was an intended raid boss as it is pretty difficult. Glitch weapons are pretty cool as they get random buffs when you reload after emptying a clip some as simple as faster fire rate to your weapon shooting shotgun bullets thats right you ever wanted an assault rifle that could randomly start shooting shotgun shells? Well thats now possible with glitch weapons.\n\nIn Conclusion\nTPS is a welcome game in the Borderlands franchise but i must say if you're new to Borderlands and reading this to see if you should buy this to start with Borderlands, buy the Borderlands 2 GOTY edition on sale its worth it as its cheap, fun and much better than TPS. But if you're like me, played all the Borderlands games, done your fair share of shouting at that bandit moving behind cover when you need a second wind then i might say buy this with Claptastic voyage if there isn't anything else to spend your money on and you need something to play or do. TPS might satisfy you","March 27, 2015","true","286.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","6","9","3","0"

It seems too short and a waste of money. I only paid $24 + a free Shock Drop Slaughter Pit (cuz I bought the retail ver). This game isn't worth the full price. If you really want this game, buy it during the Steam sales or the retail ver.\n\nThe story of this game is how Jack rose to power and you help him get to the vault and essentially save Pandora and Elpis. Everything in this game is pretty much like BL2 besides the added cryo element, laser guns & slam damage. The character classes aren't all that great. DLC characters Doppelganger Jack and Lady Hammerlock seem to be better choices. And don't count on new legendaries in this game. They're a direct copy of BL2 legendaries and only a few new ones are added. If you buy the Claptastic Voyage DLC, you get access to Glitch weapons. Which are kinda cool but not really special. The humour in this game is dry, the missions mostly require you to run back in fourth to point A to point B.  Oh and in order to get Vault Hunter Pack up to level 60 (max), you need to buy both Pack seperately. The Holodom is worthless, I didn't buy it but you could just watch the playthroughs on YouTube and the only reason that it worth buying is the dialouge between Axton, Athena and Gaige. Shock Drop is completely worthless, its just another set of slaughter rounds. The game gets boring very quickly becuase of the lack of missions.\n\nIts an okay game for people who've played BL2, but if you're just starting out, you're not gonna understand anything the character will be talking about.\n\n/long review, sorry! >_<","November 21, 2015","true","84.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","1"

It took me a half hour to get used to the look in the first game, and I've loved it ever since.\n\nPre-Sequel is a ripoff as a full-price game; it should have been an expansion. Not only because of how short it is, but because of the absolute laziness put into its design. The lack of polish is immediately obvious, and laziness quickly becomes evident when you realize a lot of objects are just retextured bits from B2. I've even heard recycled sounds, as well, not to mention reused dialogue for the vending machines and such.\n\nThe next thing that quickly becomes obvious is that the OZ mechanic is a complete gimmick; generally all it serves to do is pull you away from whatever tedious quest you're working on so you can rush off an find a few canisters, then trek back and complete whatever you were doing. Sometimes it's cool to shoot an oxygen helmet off of a bad guy and watch it damage his health, but generally it's much faster to just shoot them again instead of waiting for them to die.\n\nLow gravity had excellent potential, but the implementation is lacking. There's very little that makes actual use of it; most of the time it just ends up being a way of skipping over parts of a map, except when there's a half-a$$ed platforming section thrown in for no reason. But the biggest problem with the low gravity is that when you kill an enemy carrying a mission-critical object, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHERE IT WILL GO. I had to restart just a few minutes into a mission because the stuff an enemy was carrying shot into the side of a mountain out of reach. That is dumb.\n\nBalance is definitely not as good as B2. Sometimes you'll find yourself painfully outgunned, to the point of frustration (especially in early stages). I don't know how much of my money was wasted on respawns that should not have happened; many of the enemies are far, FAR more powerful than they should be. On the other hand, sometimes you'll find a rifle that can kill a scav in one or two non-critical hits.\n\nPickles makes me want to stab my ears out. And it's particularly jarring to hear a Cockney Brit amongst all the Australians... seriously, why is everyone on Elpis Australian? There are PLENTY of non-Aussie voice actors in Australia! DON'T BE LAZY!!!\n\nI'm not homophobic. I believe in freedom. I think homosexuals should be free to marry who they want. But are there ANY non-gay couples in this game??? Seems like every other person has a same-sex partner. Maybe it's something in the OZ...\n\nLevel design is alright but not very imaginative, and most areas feel tight and constricted, which makes the overpowered enemies even tougher. More problematic is that some of the levels are PAINFULLY long and not very well designed for future side missions, I.E. you'll have to run for an hour killing low-level enemies to make to an objective. It's frustrating and boring.\n\nHitbox glitches are probably the most annoying problem of the game so far. I've run into many instances where I'll fire a full mag at someone without hitting them, at point blank range... then move a couple of feet to the side and start hitting them. It sucks.\n\nDriving is awful, but that's to be expected (one of the weak points of all the games). The worst part is that a lot of jumps are not actually possible unless you hit absolutely PERFECTLY, which is frustrating when you're just trying to relax and enjoy yourself.\n\nWHY DO I NOT AUTOMATICALLY PICK UP ALL AMMO AND MONEY AND WHY DO I HAVE TO MANUALLY PICK UP MOONSTONES??

This game, in my opinion, was vastly inferior to Borderlands 2. I have over four times the amount of hours on Borderlands 2 than I do Borderlands: The Pre-Sequal.\nCons        Reasons                Story        Story didn't feel as in-depth as Borderlands 2. It felt like a backstory, that didn't need to be a full game, maybe a DLC at most.                Humor        The vast amount of humor that you found in BL2, one of the main reasons for that game being so great, is just not found in this game in the quantities previously mentioned.                 Bosses/Enemies        Some of the enemies are non-respawnable, and other bosses, be it mini-boss or not, just don't seem as rushed additions with no real purpose (I'm looking at you RK5)\nPros        Reasons                Gameplay (Guns)        The new features, cryo weapons & laser weapons, may not completely change the way combat feels, but it brings new options to the table.

Cosmetics        While in the vast range of moon and space, I genuinely felt in awe of the art style I fell in love with, yet again seeing the new areas.\nOverall Verdict This game shouldn't have been a full $60 game. Maybe $40-50 at most. I think the main reason it wasn't up to par was that, plainly put, it wasn't a needed story.

Up to a certain point it's all fine and dandy but there comes a point where you realise you are playing a running simulater, rather than what you'd expect from a Borderlands game. The missions become a real chore. ''Pick up this on this side of the map'', ''Now run across the map and get this thing'', ''Now, go put this in that... but not here... there'' ''Now, almost done, you see that thing on the other side of the map? We're gonna need that, go pick it up''. Which I would have much less of a problem if most of the maps didn't look the same. I was really hyped to play Borderlands in space, only to be let down by the poor map design.\n\nIt feels like 2k Australia tried to stretch the missions out as far as possible. Also, I didn't give zero sh**s about the characters. I just wanted them to shut up so I could go on about my day.\n\nI thought the grinder would be a welcome addition but it kinda ruins co op gameplay in my opinion because everybody wants weapons they can grind. Because hey ''3 blues equal a purple''. It's not like in BL2 where if a blue dropped and nobody needed it, it wouldn't matter who gets it.\n\n\n\n\nI guess there are pros to the game too but they are overshadow the cons by a long shot, but to keep it simple: The game feels like a chore and isn't as good as BL2 (where I don't mind doing missions multiple times, seriously, the replay value on that game...)","April 11","false","13.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

While this is technically correct - the engine is the same, and the gameplay is not changed so much that it could not have been done in an expansion pack back in the day - I will explain why I still think TPS is an improvement over the (already amazing) BL2 and definitely worth getting.\n\nGameplayThe gameplay formula of BL2 remains the same - shoot, slaughter enemies in amazingly creative ways, loot. However, there is one notable new feature: Oz kits and low gravity allow you to jump huge distance, slam down on enemies and even float in the air for short durations - and of course, enemies can do the same. While this may not sound like much on paper, it is a huuge improvement for the game. It really mixes up the gameplay, and to me it feels as if this is really what Borderlands needed all along.\nLaser Guns dont have all that much of an impact, but it's still a nice addition. Slag is gone and replaced by the (even more powerful) cryo, that still amplifies damage but also freezes enemies.\nIn short: If you enjoyed BL2's gameplay, you'll enjoy TPS as well only more so because buttslam.\n\nBalanceEveryone who played BL2 will remember its shortcomings: Exponential scaling that, at higher levels, made every weapon with even 1 level too less and every direct-damage skill useless. Thankfully, this is changed in TPS; although scaling is still exponential, and direct-damage skills still fall off somewhat towards high-level, the effect is much less noticeable and builds based on damage skills are totally viable even in the endgame. As a consequence, the game is much more enjoyable, although the masochists among you might find it too easy at times.\n\nClass balance is also vastly improved - all classes can be OP in some way, all classes have unique, interesting skills and multiple ways to play. I consider even the (imo) least interesting class in TPS more interesting than my favorite in BL2.\n\nStoryThe story is, as is expected from a Borderlands game, obviously no high literature. But it is well-written and interesting (imo more so than the story in BL2), and the new information gained about Handsome jack's rise to power brings interesting new points of view to the established lore.\n\nAs usual, there are lots of jokes, which you might find funny or not, but does this surprise you? It's Borderlands.\n\nSome people complain about "social agenda" forced into the game. I do not feel that this is a valid complaint, but if you are worried, head to the forums and see for yourself.\n\namount of contentMany complaints are about how this game is much much shorter than BL2.\nI do not think this is a valid complaint. Yes, the game is a little shorter (as was actually announced before release), but it's nowhere as bad as people make it out to be. Keep in mind that BL2 has 4 big story DLCs and the Headhunter packs - discounting those, the story is not that much bigger.\n\n\nSummaryIn short, TPS is basically more of the same, but better. If you didnt enjoy BL2, you most likely won't enjoy TPS either, the differences are not enough for that. But if you did, get this game. It's worth it.\n\n\n","November 7, 2014","true","198.7"," 46 of 87 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","46","87","0","1"

Rather than adjust to the differences, it felt like it was trying to be another Borderlands 2 but missing the mark by a wide margin. But it was more than that. The environments were just bland. The "graphics" were of course at parity with the previous game, but the art and design completely failed to inspire me.\n\nWithout any engagement in the story, or excitement to explore the environments, I just felt like I was wasting my time with the Pre-Sequel. The jumping and oxygen depletion systems added nothing of value to me, so it was essentially the same shooting in an inferior package.\n\nI will say that I've had similar sentiments when it comes to the the Borderlands (1&2) DLCs that I've played, which is admittedly not all of them.

The gameplay was tedious and felt more like a chore than an adventure and it almost completely lacked the soul of the previous games. It had a few moments, but it basically served as a story-telling device/cash-grab for Gearbox, a role that could have easily been filled by a comic series.\n\nOverall, the whole game has been completely underwhelming and I'm more or less disappointed in it. The bugs weren't as numerous as say, a Bethesda game, but still omnipresent and still noticeable. The boss fights were a joke and the combat was largely un-challenging. Combat in general was more tedious than enjoyable, though I suppose that fits in with the theme of the game. I've only played as Nisha, but her skills are grossly over-powered and I can't imagine how easy Wilhelm players have it. To top it off, I just went to the "raid boss" and SPOILER ALERT: It's just the final boss, only more powerful. They couldn't even be ♥♥♥♥♥ to make a new enemy. I'm more than a little disappointed I pre-ordered it and even more disappointed that I got the season pass.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheBertStare/recommended/261640/","TheBertStare","Bert","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheBertStare/","99 products in account",""A Sleeper hit from 2k Australia!"\n\nOne of the most boring, contrived, lazy and agenda-ridden games I've ever played.\nI feel like I came away from playing this garbage with more questions than answers but I'll try to explain my reasoning to the best of my knowledge.\n\nThis game is designed to fit in around after the ending of borderlands 1. While this has numerous plotholes already, 2k Australia decided that this couldn't JUST be on the exact same borderlands 2 engine - They needed to add the most aggrivating low gravity jump platforming and useless o2 meters. The Engine is already deliberately slow - for loot hunting and team gameplay. When paired with low gravity it just makes the game so difficult to navigate. All the enemies also jump around to avoid fire within low gravity, massive parts of the game are made up purely by platforming and they even added jumppads for extra jumping - You can tell, they were proud of this mechanic. This is something they looked at during development and thought "Hey, that is great!". The o2 meter is useless. I don't really need to say more as it doesn't impact the game whatsoever. The game makes it out as if it is something you should always worry about, however, I can't ever remember running out of oxygen whatsoever.\n\nThe plot is very bare and riddled with holes, as borderlands 2 provides a pretty concise story of events, via echo-logs, character interaction and inferred dialouge, the pre-sequel decides to throw that out of the window and rushes to make an already standard, unseen plot into a cartoony farce. In an attempt to make a fan favourite villain into some sort of hero fallen from grace.\nThe story is also very, VERY insistant on parroting every outdated and cringey internet meme it can muster and goes to great lengths to make almost every character gay. Well over 50% of the women you find will do nothing but loudly declare their disinterest in men, while noteable male characters in the franchise are suddenly very open about their homosexuality and press it on the player.\nIt really does ruin the immersion of the game, as other games in the series didn't do this and it feels very forced. It also goes to extremes to insult, berate and laugh at certain gender groups. It is very apparent that the writing team is able to run rampant and include their personal internet agendas into this. I don't want your social issues. I just want to do quests and find loot with friends.\nThe playable characters are boring, one dimensional smartasses with nothing noteworthy about them. They try to tie them into the game by making some of them the sub-bosses of borderlands 2, however this just feels stupid as you mostly dispose of them with ease in borderlands 2 without a passing thought.\n\nSomehow uglier than it's 3 year old predeccesor, with bland, boring enviroments to slowly run around in. Sometimes I got confused as to where I was just because every area looked the same. The moon's surface is exacly that, with reskinned enemies from borderlands 2 roaming the surface. Insides of buildings and areas are grotty, low res technology factories. Even the main city in the game is amazingly similar. The human enemies are all the same reskinned borderlands 2 enemies but with different names and australian accents. The weapons remain virtually unchanged, however they add in laser-weapons. I can count the number of genuinely unique enemies I encountered on one hand.\n\nIn short, it feels lifeless. It honestly feels so devoid of content that you could show this to anybody and they would claim it is actually very bad DLC for borderlands 2. Even as a fan of the series, I would recomend to save your money. I Bought this for £3.75, and I still feel ripped off. How depressing.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEDIT:\nI've had some people personally message me and claim that "the game gets better at max level!" Screw that, why can't the game be good from the beginning? Why do I have to slog through this hot mess JUST so I can "experience the full game?" people also berated my hours in-game.\nI've also had a person message me claiming this review is "sexist and homophobic" If you feel this way, kindly message me, I can block you so I do not have to know you exist.","March 20","false","10.3"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","2"

I know that Gearbox wanted to make this as a filler game to fill in gaps and questions fans had about the events that lead up to Handsome Jack's takeover of Hyperion, especially for people who've played both Borderlands 1 and 2, and it shows. This is just here to hold you over until Borderlands 3 comes out.\n\nSome people complain that this is just Borderlands 2 in space and they're essentially right. However, I don't see that as a negative thing since I loved Borderlands 2 (I have approx. 400 hours into that game). I expected it to be nothing else actually. It's a Borderlands game. It should look like a Borderlands game and it should play like a Borderlands game, and it pulls that off perfectly. When you go back to BL2 after playing this game you actually realize how much you miss the butt slams and the Oz kit boost ability.\n\nNow, the main problem I had with this game is that it felt way too short in comparison to BL2, especially for a game priced as a triple-A full length title. The main quest line felt too lackluster. Again, it's good for what it is but it wasn't worth €50. If it had been priced at €35-40 I could see it being a more resonable price for this game.\n\nAnother thing I didn't like about this game was that there was WAY too much dialogue where it didn't need any. I'm gonna quote TotalBicuit here and say that "it's the game that likes to hear itself talk". It can become a bit annoying here and there and the plot points they're trying to get across to the player could either be left out completely or just be explained in a much simpler manner that didn't need 2 minutes of NPC dialogue.\n\nAll in all it's a good game with minor flaws and I recommend you buy this when it's on sale.","December 26, 2014","true","93.5"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","17","31","0","1"

But I am.\n\nAfter enduring the lackluster, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ writing of Borderlands 2, I was skeptical about the pre-sequel.  I was ESPECIALLY skeptical about the sixty-dollar price tag.  But I'm glad it all turned out well (sort of), in the end.\n\nAs it happens, the pre-sequel is a more balanced gameplay experience, and much more challenging - but in a good way - than its predecessors.  Gone are the obliterating alpha strikes of badass enemies in BL2.  There are far fewer WTF gear gates and gimmicky asshats who one-shot you regardless of spec.  Now the ride is smooth, for the most part - the difficulty really spikes once you get into True Vault Hunter Mode, and the game will massacre you if you're ill-prepared.  But on the whole, things are way more fun, and ten times more mobile.\n\nThe writing blows Borderlands 2 out of the water.  I hated the writing in Borderlands 2 for reasons irrelevant to this review.  The Pre-Sequel actually reduces the amount of inane nattering in your ears from characters trying far too hard to be clever (or worse, clumsily TELLING you to care about some problem or issue or person or whatever when no one has SHOWN you why you should).\n\nIn BLTPS, instead, it presents you with surprisingly dark storytelling, a nuanced world, and incredible pacing.  This game is intense, and highly economical.  Not a moment is wasted.  It's still got some very funny moments, and I find the Scavs to be far more entertaining than the Bandits of BL2.  Some of these Australians sound so authentic, it's like they're gargling a wallaby for some of these lines.  Just deep, throaty stuff.  Delightful.\n\nOne of the darkest corners of the plot regards the rarely-trod avenue of artifical intelligences and the ethical treatment thereof.  I won't spoil anything, but it's chilling.\n\nThe cast of characters is amazing.  Claptrap is hilarious, yet surprisingly poignant and tragic, in his own sideways fashion.  Wilhelm is a refreshing breath of stoic masculinity in a medium plagued by try-hards and wanna-be ubermenschen alpha-nerd projections.  Nisha is at first hateable and seemingly two-dimensional, but unlocking more of her backstory reveals not just a cute 'for funsies' sadist, but an actual born-again psychopath who suffered the kinds of traumas that make modern serial killers.\n\nAnd then there is my absolute favorite, Athena.  In a world starved for powerful, matronly female role models, Athena takes the cake - she is both sexy and professional, modest, yet bold.  She doesn't mince words, and she makes her presence known through minimal effort.\n\nIn addition to the characters being stronger, there's also a great deal more individuality on the part of the PCs - your character responds to dialogue, to other characters, and there are plenty of in-combat call-outs geared toward specific partnerships (when one player activates their special ability, the other characters call out and notice).  Little touches like these are what seperate good games from great games.\n\nOn top of all that, the environments are gorgeous and colorful, and the music is a FANTASTIC retro-future ensemble - think EVE Online meets Bladerunner meets When Mars Attacks!\n\nI could go on and on.  The game is amazing.  Why it has a low metacritic score, I can't imagine.  I hated it at first for the difficulty, but once I acclimated, and changed some of my bad habits from Borderlands 2, I loved it.\n\nGive it a try.  The price tag is steep, I know.  Maybe wait until it goes on sale.  But if you can afford it?  Go for it - especially if you have friends to play with.","October 31, 2014","true","103.3"," 40 of 76 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","40","76","0","0"

Its a beta.\nJust check out youtube, the major publishers of Borderlands videos have actually gone back the BL2 now, thats how little content their is in this game.\nClassic bait and switch, I think ~$90 US is a completely ludicrous and exploitive price.","November 8, 2014","false","115.6"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","19","35","0","0"

To describe it, it's a lot like tying a helium balloon around the waist of a small dog or cat and ringing the dinner bell. Or maybe more like being with your kids on a trampoline and one of them is trying to throw a water balloon at you. Or perhaps like you're skateboarding down a hill and then you realize that it was uphill instead yet you are still moving for some odd reason.  Or FEDEX delivers your package one day before you order (it can happen with Amazon Prime). Yeah, that's exactly what pre-sequel is like.\n\nOne gamer called it cool, then I realized he was simply refering to the temperature on the moon and I was misinterpreting. Sorry, that was bad - I know.  Still if you liked Borderlands 2, this adds an additional fighting dimension on a new verticle axis. If you didn't get Borderlands 2, try that first, it's epic, felt like the devs put more energy into it.  This one is more like an giant DLC in my opinion.","November 3, 2014","true","5.9"," 23 of 43 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","23","43","0","0"

Even though Burch is credited, this game doesn't even hold a torch to the writing of BL2. It's like this game was supposed to be BL2 but they just dumped it and 2K AU decided to pick up the corpse and run with it. Perhaps Burch got fired and they decided to pin the blame on him instead. It's something I"d like to believe at least.\n\nAgonizingly, if you missed the original Borderlands and wanted to rehash everything which most players didn't like about it, then this is the ticket. Now with additional level design slop of the BL2 Season Pass where you walk on mysteriously sloped ledges which you shouldn't. Areas you should be able to traverse but suddenly implode upon entering. And my all time favorite - Enemies with jetpacks flying through walls and ceilings that can't be shot but can still shoot you. What's QA you ask? Pretty sure that the devs asked that same question and nobody knows the answer to. Oh wait, those jokes are all probably in there but not activated because they hit too close to home.\n\nWhile much of this game does look pretty, it's sadly frustrating and lots of the things that make this game bad will probably never get fixed like the last game. Things like the writing, but that's set in adamantium so they can't change or punch it up.

First of all its too expensive for a game that needs lots of improvements. if you wanna buy BL: TPS I think u should wait. Tbh I got bored after I finished whole game 1 or 2 times. If you familiar to borderlands games the gameplay of TPS is quite different and its easier to play. also there are less legendaries than other borderlands games and a lot of bosses arent farmable its really really annoying.

So, without further ado, lets begin by immediately discussing the pro’s list of this game: Very good storyline that does a great job tying BL1 with BL2, Oz kits are awesome as are the double jumps, new character classes, new weapon types, new ammo types, the Grinder, and the additional commentary by all of the playable characters is hilarious! ("Remember, its not Malware, it’s a feature!")\n\nNow, the con’s list: Borderlands TPS main storyline is  very  short in comparison to its predecessors, many of the side missions are very tedious, but most importantly the game has a very… unfinished feel to it. (This can be seen in graphics, countless glitches (characters getting stuck, suspended in mid-air, not to mention the countless times when there are multiple people playing we have noticed that walls and other objects seem to ‘tear’ and you can just pass right through them, in my case (count is at 3 now) in group play I have gotten “stuck” in a locker when searching for loot).\n\nFinal thoughts: Borderlands TPS has the makings of being another great game, especially with such an imaginative storyline.  However, the short story line, accompanied by a plethora of bugs, fails to truly take advantage of what, at its core, could have been a great game.\n\nThe take-away from this is to recognize that Borderlands TPS is the result of 2K, and 2K Australia,   not  Gearbox as the primary developer.\n\nI would def. recommend this game, but if you have not already purchased it, with “Tales from the Borderlands” coming out in Nov. also, I would recommend waiting until the ‘Steam’ holiday sales.\n\nAdditional comments:  Many of the new NPCs all have Aussie accents and as a result much of the humor is ‘Aussie-based cultural references/humor,’  not a complaint , just takes some getting used to.","November 17, 2014","true","168.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But then, very little is as good as Borderlands 2. And to say that this compares is really good enough.\n\nI like that they haven't changed the look and feel very much. The second game worked well, and, as they say, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\n\nBut at the same time, it is suitably different to be a different game. They've made the vending machines actually worth looking at, and the new types of gun are fun. Being on the moon is great; I spend half my time literally flying around, and, yes, butt slamming the bad guys at every available opportunity. There are different mechanics, such as grinding, which, once you've got it worked out, can be really good (for example, I put in purple weapons and got an orange out, I thought that that was pretty worth it). There are also more things to do with moonstones (the equivalent of eridium from borderlands 2) - you can, of course, use them on the black market; but you can also use them to get better grinds, to buy boost drinks from Moxxi (I haven't tried those yet) and to, occasionally, open chests of rare goodies out on a mission (not recommended from my experiences). Also, they seem to be more common than eridium, you tend to get them from killing Badasses.\n\nAs for the length of the game... well, at the time of this review (26 hours of playtime) I hope that I have plenty of time left (yes, I do ALL the side missions, I like to complete the game, if you don't like side missions, why are you playing this game?). However, I understand that it IS a shorter game, already it feels like the story is advancing more quickly than in borderlands 2, with less side missions to do between story missions - so if there is one I would suggest about buying it, it's probably DON'T buy it at full price. I got mine on sale for about £20, which is good for such a new game, and I don't regret it (especially as I only paid £5 for Borderlands 2 and I've got so much fun out of that too, I didn't mind giving some more money that I'd normally spend on a game on steam).\n\nThe only problem with the game itself is that it's a bit glitchy sometimes (especially in multiplayer). But you get used to it, and often the glitches are funny (like a friend of mine, who shall remain nameless, having claimed his shift code golden keys, came on the next day and found them back in the key dispenser, and now has double keys, which is hilarious and we have unlimited purple weapons for a while).

I certainly wouldn't call it disappointing, although there ARE some flaws, which doubtless other reviewers will describe to you in excessive length.

I personally loved it just as much as BL2, but do wish there was more/better DLC. My favorite character to play as is Jack(the voice lines are a lovely bonus). I believe some people dislike it due to:\n1. Being unable to adjust to new game mechanics and therefor blaming it on the game\n2. Being overly picky and close-minded about how the game "should" be\n\nThis game is definitely not for everyone, but if you play it with an open mind and are willing to be more creative with your tactics, this game will most likely surprise you. A quick opinion for those of you who I may have offended with that second point, the day you make a game as big as this and with all the different features while trying to keep a company afloat, then you can bash this all you want with "how it should have been."","December 14, 2015","true","36.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game has a number of flaws (in comparison to B2) but also has a lot of features that redeem it. I'll just list up the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n\n- Excellent storyline. Whereas i couldn't be arsed about B2's storyline, TPS does so a lot better. Everybody has a knack for Jack (pun intended) and TPS is focused around his side of the story that lead up to the events of B2. Don't wanna spoil it so i'll keep it short. The story will give you a lot more perspective on Jack, and why he's such a psycho hell-bent on reducing Pandora to rubble, and what morality he bears to it. You'll get to see his reasons for it.\n\n- Plenty of new additions. For example, slag has been removed and replaced with cryo damage. It's essentialy still the same thing, as it boosts damage, but enemies will be slowed or paralyzed for a few seconds, making it a far more effective elemental weapon. A new weapon is also introduced: Lasers, which is pretty much as awesome as it sounds.\n\n- Money is essentialy worthless in B2, with the exception of grinding slot machines. (which rarely give anything good anyway, so its mostly exchanging it for Eridium) Not the case anymore, vendors reguraly have excellent items on stock, even the occassional legendary item. And they dont come cheap. Money is an essential part, and paying a respawn fee is now something you want to avoid. Along with that, there's the 'Grinder', a machine that can turn items and weapons you don't need into something new, with a good chance of them increasing in rarity level. (for example, 3 green items can be turned into a blue one)\n\n- Level scaling is a lot better, with the 'Triton Flats' (an area which you will reguraly be returning to) set to your current lvl as the story progresses. Backtracking, grinding and looting is thus also a lot more viable if you wish to do so.\n\n- I've encountered a lot of bugs in B2, including a pretty gamebreaking one. It's annoying. TPS has a lot less 'rough edges', in the 50+ hours i've spent i have passed by barely any bugs at all.\n\n- A whole new cast of characters with entirely different playstyles. Whereas B2 regurgitated some of the characters from B1 into B2 (Commando being Roland, Gunzerker being Brick, etc.) every character in the game has its very own special skillsets and are extremely enjoyable as well.\n\n-There's lots of new enemies everywhere, which is awesome. Unfortunately though, some of them are mostly 'repackaged' enemies from B2. (Kragoons being Skags, Scavs being bandits, etc.)\n\nCons:\n\n- It's shorter than B2. Fewer sidequests and a slightly shorter (though more enjoyable) storyline.\n\n- Little new weaponry. There's the lasers they added, which are awesome, but they've mostly ported the arsenal from B2 to TPS. I would've enjoyed seeing some new weapons around. Though, thankfully, there are a good number of new legendaries (quite a lot, actually) to find, and i've encountered a few high-lvl weapons (blues/purples, though i could be wrong and these have been ported from B2 as well) that i haven't seen before. It's still a shame though. For a game that focuses so much on loot and progression, some new flavors would've definetly been appreciated. Claptastic Voyage includes a new rarity level (Glitch) and new weapons which are awesome, but you won't find them in the vanilla game so i don't really think they count.\n\n- They've really tried to bring back that feel of humor from it's predecessors and implemented it into TPS. Yeah, i've laughed heartily a few times, but they've tried to give you the occasional chuckle every now and then. Or at least, that's the aim. Thankfully, none of it feels forced, but it's just not funny most of the time.\n\n- The whole low gravity thing is awesome, but the fact that you have to maintain your oxygen is just annoying. Occasionaly you'll have to run off to a location containing oxygen when you're on your way. Instead of keeping the pace, you're just gonna have to stop every now and then. For absolutely no reason whatsoever. It's not a feature Gearbox, it's just annoying.\n\n- It may not be something for everyone, but the DLC is - aside from the Claptastic Voyage (which is amazing by the way) - pretty little. B2 has huge amounts of excellent DLC (DLC done right), TPS has far less. Of course, this shouldn't affect the rating of the game, it's an add-on after all.\n\nIn conclusion, i recommend B:TPS. Though i urge every person new to the series to start out with B2 (you dont need B1 if you dont wanna), if you want some more of it, totally get TPS. It might not be brimmed with content like B2 was, nor is it a huge step up what B2 did for B1, it's still a great addition to the Borderlands franchise.","August 18, 2015","true","55.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

But then, very little is as good as Borderlands 2. And to say that this compares is really good enough.\n\nI like that they haven't changed the look and feel very much. The second game worked well, and, as they say, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\n\nBut at the same time, it is suitably different to be a different game. They've made the vending machines actually worth looking at, and the new types of gun are fun. Being on the moon is great; I spend half my time literally flying around, and, yes, butt slamming the bad guys at every available opportunity. There are different mechanics, such as grinding, which, once you've got it worked out, can be really good (for example, I put in purple weapons and got an orange out, I thought that that was pretty worth it). There are also more things to do with moonstones (the equivalent of eridium from borderlands 2) - you can, of course, use them on the black market; but you can also use them to get better grinds, to buy boost drinks from Moxxi (I haven't tried those yet) and to, occasionally, open chests of rare goodies out on a mission (not recommended from my experiences). Also, they seem to be more common than eridium, you tend to get them from killing Badasses.\n\nAs for the length of the game... well, at the time of this review (26 hours of playtime) I hope that I have plenty of time left (yes, I do ALL the side missions, I like to complete the game, if you don't like side missions, why are you playing this game?). However, I understand that it IS a shorter game, already it feels like the story is advancing more quickly than in borderlands 2, with less side missions to do between story missions - so if there is one I would suggest about buying it, it's probably DON'T buy it at full price. I got mine on sale for about £20, which is good for such a new game, and I don't regret it (especially as I only paid £5 for Borderlands 2 and I've got so much fun out of that too, I didn't mind giving some more money that I'd normally spend on a game on steam).\n\nThe only problem with the game itself is that it's a bit glitchy sometimes (especially in multiplayer). But you get used to it, and often the glitches are funny (like a friend of mine, who shall remain nameless, having claimed his shift code golden keys, came on the next day and found them back in the key dispenser, and now has double keys, which is hilarious and we have unlimited purple weapons for a while). It was just quite noticeable after Borderlands 2, which I found pretty flawless in terms of gameplay.\n\nAnyway, I like this game a lot. I certainly wouldn't call it disappointing, although there ARE some flaws, which doubtless other reviewers will describe to you in excessive length. But I'm having fun, with just enough familiar, and plenty of new, and actually quite a lot of back story to Borderlands 2, which is nice.\n\n9/10 if you get it on sale","February 15, 2015","true","40.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FyreNL/recommended/261640/","FyreNL","ＦｙｒｅＮＬ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FyreNL/","530 products in account","Played about a good 50+ hours so far, finished the main game and the Claptastic Voyage, currently busy with TVHM.\n\nHonestly, i really don't get much of the negativity surrounding TPS, it's a fantastic game. The game has a number of flaws (in comparison to B2) but also has a lot of features that redeem it. I'll just list up the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n\n- Excellent storyline. Whereas i couldn't be arsed about B2's storyline, TPS does so a lot better. Everybody has a knack for Jack (pun intended) and TPS is focused around his side of the story that lead up to the events of B2. Don't wanna spoil it so i'll keep it short. The story will give you a lot more perspective on Jack, and why he's such a psycho hell-bent on reducing Pandora to rubble, and what morality he bears to it. You'll get to see his reasons for it.\n\n- Plenty of new additions. For example, slag has been removed and replaced with cryo damage. It's essentialy still the same thing, as it boosts damage, but enemies will be slowed or paralyzed for a few seconds, making it a far more effective elemental weapon. A new weapon is also introduced: Lasers, which is pretty much as awesome as it sounds.\n\n- Money is essentialy worthless in B2, with the exception of grinding slot machines. (which rarely give anything good anyway, so its mostly exchanging it for Eridium) Not the case anymore, vendors reguraly have excellent items on stock, even the occassional legendary item. And they dont come cheap. Money is an essential part, and paying a respawn fee is now something you want to avoid. Along with that, there's the 'Grinder', a machine that can turn items and weapons you don't need into something new, with a good chance of them increasing in rarity level. (for example, 3 green items can be turned into a blue one)\n\n- Level scaling is a lot better, with the 'Triton Flats' (an area which you will reguraly be returning to) set to your current lvl as the story progresses. Backtracking, grinding and looting is thus also a lot more viable if you wish to do so.\n\n- I've encountered a lot of bugs in B2, including a pretty gamebreaking one. It's annoying. TPS has a lot less 'rough edges', in the 50+ hours i've spent i have passed by barely any bugs at all.\n\n- A whole new cast of characters with entirely different playstyles. Whereas B2 regurgitated some of the characters from B1 into B2 (Commando being Roland, Gunzerker being Brick, etc.) every character in the game has its very own special skillsets and are extremely enjoyable as well.\n\n-There's lots of new enemies everywhere, which is awesome. Unfortunately though, some of them are mostly 'repackaged' enemies from B2. (Kragoons being Skags, Scavs being bandits, etc.)\n\nCons:\n\n- It's shorter than B2. Fewer sidequests and a slightly shorter (though more enjoyable) storyline.\n\n- Little new weaponry. There's the lasers they added, which are awesome, but they've mostly ported the arsenal from B2 to TPS. I would've enjoyed seeing some new weapons around. Though, thankfully, there are a good number of new legendaries (quite a lot, actually) to find, and i've encountered a few high-lvl weapons (blues/purples, though i could be wrong and these have been ported from B2 as well) that i haven't seen before. It's still a shame though. For a game that focuses so much on loot and progression, some new flavors would've definetly been appreciated. Claptastic Voyage includes a new rarity level (Glitch) and new weapons which are awesome, but you won't find them in the vanilla game so i don't really think they count.\n\n- They've really tried to bring back that feel of humor from it's predecessors and implemented it into TPS. Yeah, i've laughed heartily a few times, but they've tried to give you the occasional chuckle every now and then. Or at least, that's the aim. Thankfully, none of it feels forced, but it's just not funny most of the time.\n\n- The whole low gravity thing is awesome, but the fact that you have to maintain your oxygen is just annoying. Occasionaly you'll have to run off to a location containing oxygen when you're on your way. Instead of keeping the pace, you're just gonna have to stop every now and then. For absolutely no reason whatsoever. It's not a feature Gearbox, it's just annoying.\n\n- It may not be something for everyone, but the DLC is - aside from the Claptastic Voyage (which is amazing by the way) - pretty little. B2 has huge amounts of excellent DLC (DLC done right), TPS has far less. Of course, this shouldn't affect the rating of the game, it's an add-on after all.\n\nIn conclusion, i recommend B:TPS. Though i urge every person new to the series to start out with B2 (you dont need B1 if you dont wanna), if you want some more of it, totally get TPS. It might not be brimmed with content like B2 was, nor is it a huge step up what B2 did for B1, it's still a great addition to the Borderlands franchise.","August 18, 2015","true","55.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

Probably not worth $60 like Borderlands 2 was, but definitely good enough to pick up on a sale.\n\nEdit: Oh, I've played the DLC now, and wow, I appreciated this approach way more than Borderlands 2. Borderlands 2 had like 4 campaigns included with the season pass, and with the exception of the Tiny Tina dlc, they were forgettable and not that fun. There was only one campaign released for presequel, but it was actually a sizeable and memorable addition with an interesting story and setting couple with a fully featured boss fight. It's easible better than the four in the Borderlands 2 season pass combined. Now is this campaign included with the two dlc characters and an arena mode worth $30? I woudln't say so, it's much easier to swallow while it's on sale, but if you're not interested in either of the other content, the Claptastic Voyage is definitely worth $10.","August 7, 2015","true","62.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game keeps most of the good features and builds upon them.\n\nCons\n-Death Pits everywhere (Lava pits, holes in the ground etc. These obstacles leave little room for error and take away from the little amount of gold the game allows you to salvage)\n-Not enough save points leading to long travel times if you die (death Pits)\n-Micro objectives within objectives just to make the game longer. This is one of the most frustrating parts of the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackxblack/recommended/261640/","jackxblack","JackxBlack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackxblack/","149 products in account","TL;DR - worse Borderlands 2 that gets terribly frustrating and exhausting by the end missions. 4/10.\n\nAnd now the long one. Let's just start with stating that this is still a Borderlands game, so if you enjoyed the previous ones you will most likely enjoy this one too, especially when playing with friends. For the most of it. Then you'll get frustrated and will want to just quit this god damn game.\n\nLets start with the missions. There are some nice ones, some quite unique and fun ones. But that's like 5 out of 40. The rest are all repetitive fetch quests that get unnaturally prolonged, because if not the game wouldn't be the half of what it is now. The worst part is that this applies not only to side missions, which are obviously always lower priority for production, but for main quests as well. Without spoiling, there was a mission that could be literally summarised to:\n\n-Go to A\n-A doesn't work,  you need to go to B then\n-B doesn't work, ok C will for sure\n-Well, C ALMOST works, you only need D to make it work\n-Ok you have D? Now go back to C\n-Ok C works now? ok go to B and then you'll proceed to the final part of the mission\n\nWhere story wise, it could very well and at B and be much more fun. Even worse, by the very end the WHOLE GAME feels like it is being unneccessarily prolonged, without an actual, reasonable explenation why. That leads us to writing.\n\nThe humor is worse. It's got to a level of stupidity that is actually cringe worthy and embarasing. The one part that they did well - Jack's change - is kind of destroyed by the fact that I can't state my point about it. Obviously, it's always like that in games like this, you have no dialogue choices etc, but the problem is, in other games your character doesn't make a change on it's own as well.\n\nSPOILER STARTS HERE: I've started the game as a more or less good guy. I wanted to save the moon with Jack's help or as his help. Regardless, even though I might not be 100% rightous, I was still good. And that's the character I liked and I wanted to play as. Later, when Jack kills 4 scientist because he suspected that one of them was a traitor my character suddenly screams AWESOME. What the ♥♥♥♥? I mean, it was awesome in terms of building Jack's character, showing how voilence is changing him, but I never wanted my character to change with him, nor was I ever teased that it might happen. SPOILER OVER.\n\nNext topic. Loot and character progression are both done terribly. Let's just say I've finished the game with weapons not higher than level 22, as a 26 level character, fighting level 28 boss. That's not how you balance loot. I've switched my sniper rifle 3 times during over 20h of gameplay. Also I have not seen a SINGLE legendary weapon, not to mention one I would actually like and want to use. Something that also didn't help with my gear progression is that I lost a TON of items by them dropping into abyss. You'd imagine they could write a piece of code that ensures loot lands on reachable place in a game that's heavily loot dependend.\n\nCharacter progression can be summed up as: start with active ability, put 25 boring stat boosters after and then put an actually cool ability at level 26. Boring as hell. One thing that also needs to be mentioned here - main story balancing, combined with unrewarding loot system, pretty much makes side quests obligatory.\n\nMy last big issue with the game is it's optimization - on a GTX 780 i had very frequent drops to 30-40 even without maxing all of the settings and with turning off the PhysX. Another wierd thing with it is that even when it was running at stable 60 according to Steam FPS counter, there was TERRBILE screen tearing. G-Sync helped there, but not everyone can afford it. Then, when I switched to GTX 980Ti in the middle, it was still not achieving stable 60. What the hell. Witcher 3 runs at stable 60 in 2K, while also looking much, much better.\n\nThe other issues are not as big, but perhaps worth mentioning. Gearbox introduced a couple of new gameplay mechanics, for example oxygen in vaccum, lower gravity with booster jump and laser guns. Not a single one of those is actually fun. Oxygen is annoying, because for most of the game you don't care about it, only sometimes you are searching for O2 source nearby in panick. Lower gravity (which means higher jumps) would be fun if not the fact that level design doesn't seem to adjust to that correctly and multiple collisions are just a tiny bit too high to jump on them, even with perfectly timed booster. Laser guns are mostly useless (I found one that I was using for a bit, because it actually shot where I poitned it to, rest shoots wherever it wants).\n\nThere was also a lot of small bugs, like lacks of collisions or incorrectly placed ones, NPCs falling torso deep into terrain (mostly lunatics after their jump attack), problems with AI - NPCs walking past me peacefully while I'm in combat with their friends or launching a jump attack at a helicopter that's over lava in one of the missions, resulting in killing themselves, graphical glitches like some wierd, glowing mesh being left hanging in the air after killing one of the opponents.\n\nTo be honest it's hard to say anything good about the game aside from the fact that shooting is fun. But then the last two missions start, you have ♥♥♥♥ gear because of unrewarding loot system and you just want this to end, but it doesn't. It goes on and on and on for no logical reason other that boosting the number of hours neccessary to finish the game. I do not recommend this one.","January 2","false","28.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Taking place and tying-in the gap between BL:1 and BL:2. A lot of people and things you'll recognize if you played the first two games. It plays nearly identically to BL:2. Not exactly the same though, now you can: Grind sh*tty weapons into (hopefully) better ones, ride around in the 'Stingray' (fun little new vehicle), Butt-slam people as you hop around in Zero-G (pretty fun) and shoot laser weapons (also pretty fun). Just about everyone is Australian too... Yaaaay?....\n\nNot any revolutionary changes in the least... but it's not just BL:2 with a moon-themed skin slapped on like a lot of people imply. It DOES, however, feel like an extended DLC... but I have seen a handful of games with less content go for full Triple-A price, so I think it still has enough gameplay to justify the cost (I'd still say wait for a sale though, considering the majority of it does kind of just feel like BL:2 again).\n\nAll in all, If you enjoy the Borderlands universe I'd say this is worth looking into. It's a lot shorter than the first two games, so I'd wait for a sale if you do buy it.

It is such a strong similarity to Borderlands 2, probably why I enjoyed it that much more. A few pros vs cons\n\nPros:\nGood weapon balancing - The choice of having higher end guns available at all times really helps out in the long run\nMoney's worth - Money is really important in this game for once. I held on to 7mill in BL2 because it was useless, but in this game I'm lucky to have 100k. Money is used to buy out top-gear items like purple or legendary items that can occasionally come up in the vendors.\nInteresting Dialogue - As always, Borderlands makes the dialogue either have some deeper meaning or is flat out hilarious.\nIntroduction to new items - The added types of weapons, the O2 kits, and new abilites are amazing\nNew characters - Yo, Claptrap? For real??? lol, love the new characters\n\nCons:\nStoryline is somewhat bland - Parts of the story are repetitive, but it does come with a rather big surprise at the end\nDoesn't seem like a "new" game - Although I was stoked it was so similar to Borderlands 2, it didn't feel like a new game, just a DLC of Borderlands 2\n\nAll in all, 8.5/10, def recommend it, super fun and only gets better on harder modes + friends.","December 25, 2014","true","20.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

SPAAACE! Space, Space, SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!- Yeah mate, we are alll in spa- SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!\nthat's all you need to know.\nok, since you find it so important, I'll try and be helpfull. So, as you all know, the Game takes place in Elpis, Pandora's moon. This game also takesplace , as the name suggests, between the first game and the second game, in the chronology.\nIn this game they present to you the all 'n new mechanic of low gravity and O2 kits, these kits are this game's equivalent of Borderlands 2 relics, with the difference that in this one you ACTUALLY awknoledges them. when having an O2(we call them OZ kits for short) you can, firstly and foremost, breathe where there is no athmosphere(duh), you can also use them to (fart) boost yourself in mid-air, and slam into the ground by pressingand holding (default) "CTRL" and deal damage to nearby enemies. Different O2 kits provide different slam elements, including the all new 'n original(kinda) cryo element.\nabout the cryo element: it freezes most enemies solid, but not all. Frozen enemies will take +200% explosive and critical damage, and +250% melee damage. this damage boost is diminished when using cryo element though, in a similar fashion to "slag" from Bordelrands 2, making so that the damage improvement goes only to +110%.\nin this game we have the new 'n tasty(subtle refference to Oddworld is not subtle) Grinder. this baby will allow you to take three items of the same grade and grind them into a better grade item (or not), note that there is an exeption to the  "same grade" rule, I'll get to that in a second. There are various recipes that can be used, for example: three random white weapons will give you achange of a green weapon. Now, about the exeption I mentioned earlier, it is that you will only need two legendaries and one purple to make another legendary. there are a lot of other recipes to try and find out (or you can alternatively, if lazy enough, look up the word "grinder" in the Borderlands wikia).\nnow, onward to talk about Laser weapons. Fisrtly and most important: MR. TORGUE HATES LASER WEAPONS, BECAUSE THEY DON'T EVEN EXPLODE, LIKE: WHAAAAAT? But, yeah, you'll get to hear him complain a bit about them lasers. Laser weapons are divided into four kinds:"blaster", "railgun", "beam" and "splitter". The "blaster" variant, manufactured by Dahl, is kind of like  the "assault rifle" of the Laser weapons, firing a barrage, which means it usually fires beams of blaster bolts in a linear pattern that travel at medium speed; the "railgun" variant, manufactured by Hyperion, is sinlge firing with gret acuracy, more often then not being depicted as 100% acuracy in the weapon card, on the other hand they have very low fire rate and usually each shot costs 4 ammo instead of one; the "beam" variant, manufactured by Maliwan, fires a continuous beam that deals more damage the longer the trigger is held, similar to the way other Hyperions work on improving acuracy, being able to get to top damage in a medium of 4 seconds, however, these weapons suffer a great deal of recoil and are very short ranged(and by "a great deal", I mean almost to the extent of you "hitting your foregein grandma by mistake"); the "splitter" variant, manufactured by Tediore, (IS SUCK) fires multiple beams in spread while consuming multiple ammo per shot. all laser weapons deal elemental damage, excluding explosive #everyonehatesMRTORGUE , and, like any other weapon, may be crafted from various parts, such as a Dahl Barrel, a Maliwan Grip, a Hyperion handle and no stock. yeah, laser weapons have no stock at all. To be more precise, they do, but it is considere, as far as modifiers go, to be part of the body. For more information on this kind of (boring) interesting stuff, consult the wikia.\nThere is also the new 'n rippedoff moonstone! (non amused voice) it's eridium. Oh, you don't know what either of those are? in that case: eridium/moonstones are used buy more backpack or bank spaces so you can stuff yourself even more, or can be used to buy bigger ammo pools for each ammo type. and to acces raid bosses.\nNow, for my closing thoughts: this was more of aguide of how to basic not be lost when starting the game. Nontheless, as far as what I thought of the game itself......it's decent considering is just a "borderlands fix" for us to NOT tear ourselves to bits while we wait for Borderlands 3, and, for that, it's a great game, it's DLCs...... not so much. if you have never played Borderlands 1 or 2, I'd recommend cheking those out first(specially if you can get all DLCs fro them) still, I recomend this game for the same reason I did before: SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE. And crushing everything as a pirate CL4P-TP is always fun too just pay close attention to the music, yes? SO, go ahead ye slaty dog, lower her into you desktop and sail into adventure, lasers, and moonstone.","February 3, 2015","true","189.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","3","4","3","1"

I really wanted to love it. After the huge improvements Borderlands 2 made on Borderlands 1, you would expect another huge development with The Pre Sequal! Alas, no such improvements. In fact, it's even worse. The Pre Sequel brings memories of the original Borderlands, and not in a good way. Almost all the legendaries are from Borderlands 2, with a few new ones, and a few that have been renamed (but are still from BL2). The story.. my goodness. The story is like freshly laid crap. It has the potential to be good, but, it takes the Far Cry 3 route.... and kills the main villian when there's still a lot left to the story\nThe pitiful excuse for a raid boss is absolutely horrendous. It's not fun at all, unlike Terramorphus or Crawmerax. Not only that, but the DLC that they've released is even worse, bringing shame to the franchise. How can you go from great DLC such as the Secret Armory of General Knoxx and Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage to junk like the Holodome Onslaught DLC?\nUnacceptable. If possible, I would wish that we don't even count this as a part of the Borderlands franchise. The ending is obviously tacked on, bringing no sense what so ever. A waste of $59.99. Mediocre in every way. The only good part of this mess is Jack, but not even he can bring this up.\nI'm a die hard Borderlands fan. I have over 300 hours on the PS3 version for BL1 and 362 hours for BL2 on PC. I loved every part of BL1 and BL2. I could barely finish this game. It is one of the most disappointing games of 2014, and I do not recommend it.","December 24, 2014","false","62.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

If you want to buy the TPS, buy the story DLC too. Before it, TPS was suffering seriously. You'll finish the story in TVHM around level 50, but there wasn't any motivation to continue - even with UVHM and if you had the Holodome DLC and level cap increase (in fact, that was waste of money). The majority of the bosses and unique enemies, who had assigned loot only spawned once per playthrough - you killed it for the quest, if you got their loot, then you had luck, if not...well, you had to get known to the "alt+f4 farming". Thankfully they patched it with the story DLC's release, so it's not an issue anymore. Before it, the endgame looked like: you went to Iwajira, killed him a few times until you got 2 Thingies to grind legendary weapons. Or alternatevely you could farm the vending machines. Which is not an end-game in my book.\n\nHowever, there are still problems: there are lot's of legendaries which don't have any dedicated loot source and you have to farm the grinder and/or the vending machines for them. Like the Maggie, or VIral Marketer. Or Sledge' Shotty. Or.... I could continue this list for a while. On the other side, some loot's drop chance is glitched. The IVF (it's essentially the Baby Maker from BL2) should drop from Tony Slows. However, it doesn't drop from him, so the only way to get this weapon is again, the Grinder or Vending Machines. Then there are lots of unique enemies who don't have any loot drops, like the 3 darksiders who drop the prisms for a mission.\n\nOtherwise, the game itself is good. Not as good as Borderlands 2, but the story is interesting, the characters and the style of telling the story is awesome as well. The new things in gameplay are good too, butt slamming and air boosting adds a nice flow to the combat dynamics, and the Cryo element has some characteristics, that makes it better and more interesting than the slag was in BL2.\n\nI would rate TPS a solid 7.5/10 (for comparison, BL1 would be around 8-8.5, and BL2 would be 8.5 or 9)","April 6, 2015","true","434.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

SPAAACE! Space, Space, SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!- Yeah mate, we are alll in spa- SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!\nthat's all you need to know.\nok, since you find it so important, I'll try and be helpfull. So, as you all know, the Game takes place in Elpis, Pandora's moon. This game also takesplace , as the name suggests, between the first game and the second game, in the chronology.\nIn this game they present to you the all 'n new mechanic of low gravity and O2 kits, these kits are this game's equivalent of Borderlands 2 relics, with the difference that in this one you ACTUALLY awknoledges them. when having an O2(we call them OZ kits for short) you can, firstly and foremost, breathe where there is no athmosphere(duh), you can also use them to (fart) boost yourself in mid-air, and slam into the ground by pressingand holding (default) "CTRL" and deal damage to nearby enemies. Different O2 kits provide different slam elements, including the all new 'n original(kinda) cryo element.\nabout the cryo element: it freezes most enemies solid, but not all. Frozen enemies will take +200% explosive and critical damage, and +250% melee damage. this damage boost is diminished when using cryo element though, in a similar fashion to "slag" from Bordelrands 2, making so that the damage improvement goes only to +110%.\nin this game we have the new 'n tasty(subtle refference to Oddworld is not subtle) Grinder. this baby will allow you to take three items of the same grade and grind them into a better grade item (or not), note that there is an exeption to the  "same grade" rule, I'll get to that in a second. There are various recipes that can be used, for example: three random white weapons will give you achange of a green weapon. Now, about the exeption I mentioned earlier, it is that you will only need two legendaries and one purple to make another legendary. there are a lot of other recipes to try and find out (or you can alternatively, if lazy enough, look up the word "grinder" in the Borderlands wikia).\nnow, onward to talk about Laser weapons. Fisrtly and most important: MR. TORGUE HATES LASER WEAPONS, BECAUSE THEY DON'T EVEN EXPLODE, LIKE: WHAAAAAT? But, yeah, you'll get to hear him complain a bit about them lasers. Laser weapons are divided into four kinds:"blaster", "railgun", "beam" and "splitter". The "blaster" variant, manufactured by Dahl, is kind of like  the "assault rifle" of the Laser weapons, firing a barrage, which means it usually fires beams of blaster bolts in a linear pattern that travel at medium speed; the "railgun" variant, manufactured by Hyperion, is sinlge firing with gret acuracy, more often then not being depicted as 100% acuracy in the weapon card, on the other hand they have very low fire rate and usually each shot costs 4 ammo instead of one; the "beam" variant, manufactured by Maliwan, fires a continuous beam that deals more damage the longer the trigger is held, similar to the way other Hyperions work on improving acuracy, being able to get to top damage in a medium of 4 seconds, however, these weapons suffer a great deal of recoil and are very short ranged(and by "a great deal", I mean almost to the extent of you "hitting your foregein grandma by mistake"); the "splitter" variant, manufactured by Tediore, (IS SUCK) fires multiple beams in spread while consuming multiple ammo per shot. all laser weapons deal elemental damage, excluding explosive #everyonehatesMRTORGUE , and, like any other weapon, may be crafted from various parts, such as a Dahl Barrel, a Maliwan Grip, a Hyperion handle and no stock. yeah, laser weapons have no stock at all. To be more precise, they do, but it is considere, as far as modifiers go, to be part of the body. For more information on this kind of (boring) interesting stuff, consult the wikia.\nThere is also the new 'n rippedoff moonstone! (non amused voice) it's eridium. Oh, you don't know what either of those are? in that case: eridium/moonstones are used buy more backpack or bank spaces so you can stuff yourself even more, or can be used to buy bigger ammo pools for each ammo type. and to acces raid bosses.\nNow, for my closing thoughts: this was more of aguide of how to basic not be lost when starting the game. Nontheless, as far as what I thought of the game itself......it's decent considering is just a "borderlands fix" for us to NOT tear ourselves to bits while we wait for Borderlands 3, and, for that, it's a great game, it's DLCs...... not so much. if you have never played Borderlands 1 or 2, I'd recommend cheking those out first(specially if you can get all DLCs fro them) still, I recomend this game for the same reason I did before: SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE. And crushing everything as a pirate CL4P-TP is always fun too just pay close attention to the music, yes? SO, go ahead ye slaty dog, lower her into you desktop and sail into adventure, lasers, and moonstone.","February 3, 2015","true","189.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","3","4","3","1"

A few pros vs cons\n\nPros:\nGood weapon balancing - The choice of having higher end guns available at all times really helps out in the long run\nMoney's worth - Money is really important in this game for once. I held on to 7mill in BL2 because it was useless, but in this game I'm lucky to have 100k. Money is used to buy out top-gear items like purple or legendary items that can occasionally come up in the vendors.\nInteresting Dialogue - As always, Borderlands makes the dialogue either have some deeper meaning or is flat out hilarious.\nIntroduction to new items - The added types of weapons, the O2 kits, and new abilites are amazing\nNew characters - Yo, Claptrap? For real??? lol, love the new characters\n\nCons:\nStoryline is somewhat bland - Parts of the story are repetitive, but it does come with a rather big surprise at the end\nDoesn't seem like a "new" game - Although I was stoked it was so similar to Borderlands 2, it didn't feel like a new game, just a DLC of Borderlands 2\n\nAll in all, 8.5/10, def recommend it, super fun and only gets better on harder modes + friends.","December 25, 2014","true","20.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This then leads on to the next con...\n\n- You Dun Goofed The DLC\n\nSo, TPS launched with no Endgame, so gamers made one: farming Iwajira and the like. Then, Gearbox TOOK thay away, and are now charging you for farming and gaining levels in the new Holodome DLC. I love the Borderlands franchise, BUT COME ON GEARBOX.\n\nOverall Verdict:\n\n7.5/10 - It's like a Borderlands 2 Chinese knock off. Thankfully, I bought it at half price and not at the full 30 quid it asked for.\n\nGreedy ♥♥♥♥♥.","December 26, 2014","true","18.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I really wanted to love it. After the huge improvements Borderlands 2 made on Borderlands 1, you would expect another huge development with The Pre Sequal! Alas, no such improvements. In fact, it's even worse. The Pre Sequel brings memories of the original Borderlands, and not in a good way. Almost all the legendaries are from Borderlands 2, with a few new ones, and a few that have been renamed (but are still from BL2). The story.. my goodness. The story is like freshly laid crap. It has the potential to be good, but, it takes the Far Cry 3 route.... and kills the main villian when there's still a lot left to the story\nThe pitiful excuse for a raid boss is absolutely horrendous. It's not fun at all, unlike Terramorphus or Crawmerax. Not only that, but the DLC that they've released is even worse, bringing shame to the franchise. How can you go from great DLC such as the Secret Armory of General Knoxx and Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage to junk like the Holodome Onslaught DLC?\nUnacceptable. If possible, I would wish that we don't even count this as a part of the Borderlands franchise. The ending is obviously tacked on, bringing no sense what so ever. A waste of $59.99. Mediocre in every way. The only good part of this mess is Jack, but not even he can bring this up.\nI'm a die hard Borderlands fan. I have over 300 hours on the PS3 version for BL1 and 362 hours for BL2 on PC. I loved every part of BL1 and BL2. I could barely finish this game. It is one of the most disappointing games of 2014, and I do not recommend it.","December 24, 2014","false","62.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

I enjoy it more than i enjoyed Borderlands 2. It has better guns, better characters, the DLC characters are better than the ones in BL 2 except Caige, it has a interaction with the character you chose. Of course that's my personal opinion. It could have been better if players could the skin packs like in the previous game. The laser guns are the best!  That's probably my favourite game!\nBorderlands The Pre-Sequel- 9/10","September 3, 2015","true","50.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Unfortunately, the game turns out to be ridiculously short and end-game is virtually nonexistant--a nasty combo.  Unlike BL2, the DLC introduces virtually no new content; only the last one really changes your gameplay experience and gives you something to do.\n\nI...honestly can't recommend this game unless you've completely exhausted BL2 and all its DLC and are desperate for more gameplay.  Combat isn't terribly balanced and endlessly farming the same end-game boss for gear with which you fight that same boss again and again, well...  It's a mess.","March 18","false","82.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Sadly, Borderlands has never been anything more than a mediocre gameplay experience with decent, varying greatly with personal taste, humor. Hilarious and entertaining for some, a complete and utter waste of time for others. Everthing unique about this game (mainly the randomly generated guns) has had no update significant enough to make it stand out from its predecessors. The new mechanics not present in previous installments are more of an annoyance than an improvement. On a final note, if you found Claptrap annoying in previous games, do not even bother playing this because there are Claptraps in every area of the game and Claptrap is a playable character. Repetative, irritating dialog from Claptrap will be enough to make someone who enjoyed the previous games but hated Claptrap want to stay away from this entirely.","October 30, 2014","false","3.9"," 30 of 57 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","30","57","0","15"
