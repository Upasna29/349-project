The gameplay is extremely tight and responsive, which is good because it is also very challenging.  Skillful play is rewarded.  In this respect it feels similar to the old style FPS like DOOM where you would find yourself with little health, no ammo and a roomful of baddies, hoping that one of the vanquished will drop you 10 hp to keep you going for another room.\n\nThere are also roguelike elements.  The ziggurat is different on every playthrough, and the weapons you find are randomised.  Sometimes you will find a grenade weapon and then encounter a room with hordes of little enemies.  You will have an easy time.  Other times you will find a crowd control staff and a few massive bulletsponge enemies.  Tough luck.  When you level up, you can choose one of two randomly drawn perks.  Some will be very useful, some will replenish your health in a one-time deal, some will make you stronger over the long term.  There are also treasure rooms and shrine rooms, where you can sacrifice health and ammo to the gods, who might reward you or if you are Superjunk punish you every time.\n\nI definitely recommend this game.  It's good old-fashioned FPS goodness with a healthy serving of roguelike on the side.  But if you are skillful, the roguelike elements can't doom you from the start like in other titles, where you might keep restarting the game until you get a good starting item.  There are also evil carrots in this game that try to bite you.  I hate carrots in real life, they are an awful vegetable.  So it is good to shoot them with my stick.","November 29, 2014","true","52.8"," 279 of 294 people (95%) found this review helpful 59 people found this review funny","95","279","294","59","0"

A glorious mixture of concepts / mechanics, and a very high replay value.\n\nI'm a big fan of the Heretic / Hexen / Doom / Quake / Unreal games, as well as Serious Sam. I don't think Ziggurat is a rip off or a copy of Heretic, but you can basically imagine it as a Heretic RPG, rogue-lite, dungeon-crawler, etc. Basically, it's a really great game and worth the full price.\n\n\nSome people complain the game isn't worth buying without local co-op / some form of multiplayer, and probably about half of those people changed their mind after buying the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/recommended/308420/","spiritreviews","Spirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/","732 products in account","Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!\n\nI have a love/hate relationship with the concept of Early Access. What's my ideal Early Access title? It's a game that, in its current state, feels like it can stand alone as a release. Maybe it's rough around the edges, maybe it isn't fully fleshed out, but it's a more or less finished product that can stand to be improved. Early Access should be like... like when you order something at a restaurant – let's say a club sandwich – and they bring it out and say, “sir/madam, we're sorry but your homestyle sea salt french fries will be out in a few minutes.” And you're like, “oh, that's cool. This sandwich looks pretty good.” And you wait a few minutes, take a few bites out of your excellent club sandwich, and then they present you with your fries. “Ziggurat” is a delicious club sandwich – not too heavy on the mayonnaise and the bacon is crispy. I'm not exaggerating when I say that it is one of the most polished, fun titles I've seen ever from Early Access. And hopefully the fries are incoming.\n\n“Ziggurat” is a dungeon crawler FPS roguelike (say that ten times fast) that has color and style reminiscent of DOTA 2, enemies straight out of the “Zeno Clash” series and “Fable,” and the fast, strafing combat found in “Serious Sam.” You select a character (you'll unlock others as you accomplish feats like 200 wand kills, each with their strengths and weaknesses) and start on the first floor. In the top right corner you have your dungeon map layout for reference. As you explore you'll fight minions (carrot men, floating stone dragons, suits of armor, goblin dudes, leaping bird lizards), dodge traps, and find a portal key that unlocks the boss and exit, all the while exploring a labyrinth carved from stone, ceilings held up by bone columns and looking otherwise metal as ♥♥♥♥. Once you find the end room you'll engage in a boss battle with a unique big baddie. Once you beat it you're shown your score (determined by kills, floors cleared, time) and you're on to the next floor. As you progress you'll find new weapons (you start off with a basic replenishable wand but you'll soon find an ice orb that fires like a shotgun, fire grenades, etc.), perks, and journals that delve into the story of this magical place full of beautiful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t nightmare monsters.\n\nSo what else can I say about “Ziggurat?” It just feels cool, y'know? You unlock stylish tarot cards that describe your perks. When you die you'll be frustrated and immediately laugh at the resulting death screen. Floors range from uncomfortably claustrophobic (like when your parents leave you alone in the living room with your handsier relatives) to wide and expansive. The enemies have a variety of tactics, some rushing at you with reckless abandon, some content to fire at a distance like total ♥♥♥♥♥. As you change your tactics – say closing the distance between some distant foe – they'll change their tactics in turn, ground bashing until you beat a hasty retreat or shotgun their ♥♥♥♥ face with ice shards. It's highly polished, highly fun, and super pretty like that girl you didn't ask to prom and no it isn't too late JUST GO TO HER SHE'S WAITING.\n\nIt might be the prettiest Early Access title yet. The color palette is rich and varied without looking like rainbow vomit – a happy medium between drab dungeon and colorful fantasy. It's challenging without being too big a ball kicker or ball coddler (pick a side, we're at war). And most importantly it feels done. This can only be improved and expanded on. This is something that even if it never saw completion it would still feel like a worthwhile buy. This might be the most excited I've been about an Early Access game in a good while – at least since I've had a decent club sandwich.\n\nEdit: Ziggurat is now available, having completed its Early Access cycle in three months. Early Access devs, take note - THIS is how you do it.","August 14, 2014","true","9.7"," 144 of 171 people (84%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","84","144","171","7","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/308420/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Ziggurat is a challenging first person rogue-lite game. You roam around procedural generated dungeons with various different types of enemies, traps and bosses.\n\nThe graphics are appealing, the dark theme is done very well, often at times it is so dark it's really hard to see anything and you have to use your spells to light the way.\n\nEach dungeon is completely randomly generated, you will never run the same dungeon more than once, each room has a chance to either be full of minions, a trap room, or a reward room. Enemies drop experience orbs, every time you level up, you get to choose a special ability/skill, such as increasing the amount of health you get from health pots, or increasing your speed when you are hit. This is a nice feature which makes it feel a little different to other rogue-lite games.\n\nYou also have to manage various different mana pools, you pick up different wands and weapons that use the different mana pools, enemies drop mana pots to keep them topped up.\n\nThis is actually a really difficult game, even on easy mode, I struggled even on level one on the normal mode, but managed to get all the way to the end level and then fail on easy mode, so even that is a struggle. I have yet to try anything higher because I would just get wrecked.\n\nIn order for me to complete a run on easy mode, I had to put three hours into Ziggurat, and this is only the tip of the ice berg of what's actually on offer. I have now unlocked a further four or five characters that I can play, and then there are additional challenges to unlock more. I'd say there is easily twelve more hours of content available here.\n\nI didn't have any technical issues or bugs, its an extremely well put together game, that runs perfectly, running most of the time at 120+ fps.\n\nZiggurat is probably one of the best rogue-lite games I've played and can definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a magical dungeon crawling challenge.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Until I played Ziggurat that is.\n\nGame overview\n* Genre (tags): Rogue-lite, FPS, action, magic\n* Avg length: ∞ (or ~1 hour for a run)\n* Developer: Milkstone Studios\n* Publisher: Milkstone studios\n* Release Date: October 2014 (pc), 2015 (consoles)\n* Platform: pc, ps4, Xbox One\n\n<<<Pros and cons>>>\n\n+ Overall fun and thrilling experience\n+ Lots of replayability\n+ Neat soundtrack\n+ Appealing art style\n+ Save & quit in the middle of a run\n+ Great price!\n+/- It can be somewhat 'unfair' at times (though that is part of the genre)\n- Platforming is rather tedious\n\nFull game review\nYou are a wizard apprentice who has been studying magic for many years. Finally, you are able and ready to participate in 'the Ziggurat', a test in which you prove your worth to the Daedolon brothers: they form the most powerful wizard guild that rules and protects the lands. Your goal is to become a part of this guild - to be a Deadolon brother - but that is far from easy. Very few manage to get out of the dangerous fortress alive; only the strongest will make it - usually not without physical and mental wounds.\n\n<<<Gameplay, fun factor and replayability>>>\n\nYou enter a vast dungeon constructed of many floors to succeed the test of becoming a powerful wizard. You automatically possess a wand at the start and will be given a new random weapon each floor. There is also a level-up system that allows you to choose between various perks (cards) to improve/change the way you play. You will definitely need those weapons and perks: along the way, you'll come face to face with many enemies, challenges and other kinds of hazards. The majority of the time, you'll find yourself slaying waves of enemies (minions) though, but the different types of rooms make sure to keep things a little fresh: challenge rooms, rooms with lore scrolls, treasure rooms, secret rooms ... each of which will test your skill and knowledge.\n\nI have played Ziggurat for about 20 hours so far and I've had (and still having) so much fun with it! The fast pacing of the game certainly has to do with it: being able to run/jump around and shoot enemies down with various spells, staves and bombs  to cause destruction - yet so simple - is really satisfying. Besides the combat part, there is also a (limited) sense of exploration. Finding secret rooms is fun and rewarding. Especially lore rooms are a nice treat: they give you experience, but also give you some backstory and (indirect) hints.\n\nThe game is not only fun, but also offers a ton of replayability for those who so desire. I have played a good amount of rogue-likes/rogue-lites before and I'm actually quite suprised by the amount of variety there is in the game: 17 chacracters, more than 150 different perks (cards) and a ton of weapons and enemy types. Rooms can even have modifiers to them (e.g. "more drops", "enemies are tougher" etc). No run is basically the same. For those who are really feeling it, there is also an 'endless mode' besides the normal mode (= easy, normal, hard). It is the perfect challenge/fun run for people who want to go through an extremely long (and hopefully powerful) run with their favourite character(s). Seeing that I have already played 20 hours, but only completed 5 characters on normal mode, I imagine I still have a lot of thrilling and satisfying hours to come with this indie gem.\n\nWith all that being said, let's not neglect the fact that it is a pretty difficult game. This is not a bad thing per se, but casual players may be rather turned off. Even on easy mode the game will still offer plenty of challenges. As it is a rogue-lite game, most game elements (weapons, enemies ...) are procedurally generated, which means that you can get really unlucky at certain times. Even when you feel like you have a good amount of health, decent weapons and perks, you can get screwed when you enter a room that is really difficult to tackle with your current setup. This can suddenly end your run that seemed to be going so well, which can be extremely frustrating. To summarize it; this is a game that will never let you relax fully and will keep you on your toes throughout the whole run.\n\n<<<Controls, graphics and sound>>>\n\nThe controls are easy to get used to and are very smooth. Movement is simple and feels appropriate: you either walk or sprint and you can turn around quickly, which is really useful in a game where danger can be found in every corner. Aiming and shooting the weapons is pretty accurate, but may take you some time to get used to. A minor point of frustration comes from the 'platforming' parts: I find it pretty tough to estimate where my character will land. This is not so much of a problem when big platforms are available, but having to jump from and onto small objects can be really tricky. It is definitely not game breaking though and will not ruin the fun for the most part. Lastly, there is full key binding available and it is also both fun/playable with either keyboard & mouse or a controller.\n\nThe game is furthermore pleasant to look at: you can definitely see that the developers created the art style with a lot of care. The vast dungeon - even though most of the rooms look fairly similar - has a nice and appealing look to it. It looks cartoony, yet dark at the same time and that really gives it the magical touch it needs. Also, the different floors have their unique look, torches are hanging all over the place, there are statues standing around - all of these elements bring the dungeon to life and set you in the perfect mood for a dungeon crawling experience.\n\nAs far as the soundtrack goes, there is nothing to complain. It is good. Not super duper amazingly good, but still really well done. It fits perfectly in a dungeon crawling game and helps setting the atmosphere. After all these hours, I have not grown tired of it yet, which is good. Certain games make me want to turn off their soundtrack because it really gets too repetitive - this game doesn't do that at all. I feel the music is mandatory to enjoy the 'full Ziggurat experience.'\n\n<<<The verdict>>>\n\nCertainly recommended, especially for people who like a fairly challenging rogue-lite game full of fast paced magical combat. Casual gamers may not really find their business here, but if they are looking for an entrance into the rogue-lite/rogue-like genre, easy mode is a good way to start.\n\nLay-out overhaul & minor content changes: May 10th 2016","January 26","true","22.6"," 76 of 82 people (93%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","93","76","82","9","16"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/308420/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","For every apprentice that enters the labyrinth of chaos and torment, the question isn't "Do you fear death?"\nThe question is "Would it bother you to have your soul ripped into thousands of pieces and cast into limbo?"\n\nFrom what I assume, becoming a sorcerer (even a lowly one) can involve pacts with foul demons, bargains with merchants of questionable reputation, and agreements with some straight-up nasty people. In short, when evil comes to collect, you better be damn sure you've become the Ultimate Wizard by then.\n\nBut for us at home playing Ziggurat, there are no questions. We don't want to die, because then we lose all of our stuff and have to start over. Honestly, I can't understand how the rogue-lite has become so popular. I'm from the old-school, and by that I mean Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, not Wizardry and Rogue. I'm not used to failure when it comes to RPGs or games with RPG elements. I like holding onto game-saves, even when I haven't played the game they belong to for decades. When I bought Ziggurat, I was expecting an FPS adventure with RPG elements, and nothing more.\n\nOops?\n\nIt's not by choice that I play rogue-lites. I think it's because I keep getting tricked into buying them. Oh well. Ziggurat is a great game, with a good balance of challenge and entertainment. Unlike a number of titles, Ziggy delivers a focused experience. By that I mean you're not going to be drowning in fluff. Survival isn't a matter of loading up on relics, so that every step you take summons thousands of poison-soaked exploding buzz-saws. Survival is almost entirely dependent on your reflexes. You're expected to dodge hundreds of thousands of projectiles, but you don't get any cool tricks like a quadruple-jump or an invincible back-flip. Your weapons never get +1 to awesome or +2 to more awesome. Your survivability is determined by how many fireballs you don't take to the face. It's a concept as old as time, but tends to feel novel when compared to some other rogue-lites.\n\nThat isn't to say that there's no incentive to leveling. With every level-up you're given a choice of two perks. Oft-times, this choice is merely to decide which perk sounds less stinky. Adapting to this constantly-changing situation is extremely important. I mean yeah, I'd love it if I got nothing but perks that gave me more health or better armor, but sometimes I have to settle for increased fire-rate on a weapon I never use. Either I suck it up and "git gud", or I die horribly and blame Zigguroni for my failings. Also, with every death, more perks are unlocked. This means greater variety, as well as greater chances of not getting those perks I believe are necessary to survive.\n\nDespite this randomness, Ziggurat is fairly-designed game. Seemingly every attack can be dodged, it's just a matter of avoiding overwhelming situations. For this, I recommend a good weapon. Not all spells, staves, and alchemic mixtures are created equal. I tend to get good results when my arsenal consists of:\n\nSpell - Wraith Rings\nStaff - Scarab Beetle or Eagle\nAlchemy - Porcupine bomb\nYMMV\n\nWhen the weapon isn't optimal, you may find it necessary to use the power of an amulet. These rare trinkets can perform exceptional feats like freezing every enemy in the area. They're found in heavily-trapped rooms and have to be recharged. It's usually worth the trouble, but if you're truly overwhelmed, a brief respite probably won't turn things around. At least your apprentice's hit-box is small enough to make those tight projectile dodges. However, when it comes to melee and AOE attacks, I believe they're a little too effective. It always feels like I'm a good few feet away from an explosion or the swing of a sword and I still take damage. The final boss can create fire that rains from the sky. Sometimes its like no matter where I stand I'm getting hurt.\n\nAll in all, Ziggurat is a fine game to lose a dozen or more hours to. It's a well-designed infusion of fast-paced FPS action. The number and variety of perks & spells help to keep every play-through interesting. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to get back to work on my pyramid. When my time comes, I expect to keep my stuff. Besides, I think I'll need an additional life-time or four if this backlog is ever going to get finished.","July 4, 2015","true","12.8"," 59 of 68 people (87%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","87","59","68","11","0"

Choose your path and fight your way through masses of monsters until you defeat...No, wait. This is not about GT Interactive and the mid 90s!\nThis is about Ziggurat, a first person dungeon crawler with a roguelike attitude. So what about Hexen then? Read further.\nWelcome to Ziggurat, a place where every apprentice wants to be.\nWelcome to Ziggurat, the place that no apprentice returns from.\n\nYou are one of them, Argo, a talented magician that wants to enter the high circle of daedalon. But only those strong and brave enough to survive the dangers that lurk through the corridors, eagerly waiting for your soul to consume shall be granted with high power and wisdom. And their life, of course.\n\nLet’s cut to the chase. The reason why I chose to compare Hexen with Ziggurat is simple. At least if you have played as a mage back then. It is the same great feeling, fighting against monsters in first person, looking for artifacts and eagerly hoping for potions - but without the old doom engine. Visuals are dark, hazy and serve just great. Again, a mixture of Hexen but also Torchlight comes into my mind. Shining spells, flaming lava or creepy goblins may not look like Skyrim’s realism but they don’t have to make yourself comfortable. Typical cave and dungeon sounds and a pumping soundtrack complete the picture of what Ziggurat tries to be: a mixture of dungeon crawling and First Person Shooter that demands quick focusing, running, dodging and even more running. People complaining about the difficulty do not overreact at all. My first walkthrough ended up in the second room of the first floor since I did not know anything about the enemies behaviour, poisonous clouds and the right time to aim and dodge. The game is a roguelike that punishes every mistake but offers millions of endorphins after a hard passage got solved so prepare yourself with tea and patience.\n\nWhat is the gameplay like? You start with a wand that has an infinite mana-pool. This does not mean you can hold for autofire since it still consumes mana and replenishes over time. While struggling through the dungeon you might find other weapons that use different types of mana, named Spells, Sticks and Alchemy. These are more powerful than your starting wand but not infinite so mana should be saved for critical situations. Progress in Ziggurat is made with opening doors. Every room you enter must be solved before you can move on. Prepare to meet monsters, traps and secret passages. The Good: Rooms can also contain shrines, where one might pray for godly help. The Bad: Even the Gods send plagues sometimes. Every dungeon looks unique since it is randomly generated so do not even think about planning for your next run when your health is low. Every stage holds a key and a boss. Find the portalstone, get into the boss room, hopefully defeat the boss and move to the next stage.\n\nProgress. Killed Monsters drop mana crystals, health potions or experience, some champions or bosses might even drop special items like powerful charms. After having gained a certain amount of EXP you can level up. Doing so, you can choose between random perks or replenishments, like thicker skin, more health or faster movement. If you die, and you will die a lot, all of your progress will be summarised. This will not only place you in a leaderboard but also unlock new perks and artifacts that can be found in your next walkthroughs permanently. Additionally, killing monsters and doing damage unlocks monster information and more playable characters with new strengths and weak points, offering a wide array of playstyles, thus offering motivation for hours and hours.\n\n\nBig Text, Quick Facts:\nPro:\nPerfect mixture of different genres - spellcasting FPS meets roguelike dungeon crawler\nRandomized dungeons and items = infinite playthroughs\nVisuals are up to date with nice animations, rooms and monster design\nUnlockable characters, perks and monster infos\nThrilling but rewarding gameplay - dodge, run, aim, shoot, run\n15 € is more than just a fair price for this gem\nCon:\nBackground story sounds generic - but serves well.\nPrepare to get frustrated - even on normal difficulty. Some rooms and / or mobs tend to act unfair, at least sometimes.\nZiggurat is Ziggurat - meaning dungeon, dungeon, dungeon.\n\nSummary:\nOh, what did I expect? A game that could hold up to my child memories. What did I get? A game that even surpasses my expectations. Ziggurat catched my whole love and attention, right from the start. Exploring, fast-paced spellcasting combat and dozens of perks and characters to unlock in a randomly generated dungeon sum up into a challenging magic roguelike.\n\nDying multiple times doesn’t scare you?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/henx125/recommended/308420/","henx125","[i]Henx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/henx125/","336 products in account","So I'm have to start out by saying that I enjoyed my time with this game well enough, but that I feel that I still need to caution potential buyers of this game by not recommending it to them. My reasoning? Well, the short answer is that the price they are asking for at $15 is too high for what you get.\n\nThe long:\nI bought this off of the recommendation of TotalBiscut after watching his first impressions by it, and I'd say his opinions almost always line up with mine - except in this instance. I think the main problem for this is that all I did was take his first impressions into account and made assumptions I shouldn't have, and thats on me for not researching farther.\n\nOne of my biggest problems with this game that I assumed based on his video was that you would be able to play for as long as you could manage with your character. I was surprised to find that it had an end, that you could "beat" the game. Now, ordinarily that wouldn't be a problem, but in this case I found that it was because I felt very disappointed when I discovered how short a successful playthrough actually is (About an hour, in my case). I liked what I had going with my character, and I was having fun with him. Yet, much to my dismay, found I had to stop playing with him after only 5 levels. I hadn't even encountered one of the 4 weapon types, alchemical, yet. So when I defeated the last boss, I thought, can I continue? Can I do New Game+? Continue and restart on a harder difficulty? Or at least just let me continue wandering through random dungeons to see how far I could get? But none of those options were available to me.\n\nSo upon completing I received some unlocks for completing certain achievements. Interestingly, some of them were perks that I might have a chance to use upon leveling up in my next run. And there is where I have another problem with the game. Not so much that I can unlock things, like new characters with slightly differing abilities forcing you to play one way or another, but that I realized as a result of this that the game is built with "sideways replayability". What I mean by that is that most of the game's content is centered around the idea that you play many many times, and that each time your start may be a little different and the number of things you have a chance of upgrading your character with expands as you play. This may be fine for some people, but to me it just means that my individual runs' fun factor are severely reduced. Giving you more things to play with over time is fine, but starting you out with a very basic set of possible upgrades and expecting you to grind to have the chance to see others is not, especially when you can't continue for very long even when you get lucky enough to get the perfect build lined up.\n\nI suppose this style of replayability would be fine enough were there more variety in both weapons available and enemy types to fight, maybe even level designs if we are lucky. But After playing through around 5 runs, each with a different character, I am already pretty fatigued. It very quickly became a matter of seeing the same thing over again and using the same exact set of weapons, which in themselves are not all that varied to begin with. And what is my incentive to keep playing? To maybe get lucky and get really far? Well no, that's not even possible, so I cant play with that as my goal. To obtain more starting characters? Well they really aren't that different and basically just force you to use a certain weapon type for the most part... What about the new perks you are getting? Well again, a) you have to rely on chance just to have the option to use them in the first place, and b) then why do you really care if you already know the ceiling is so low? It doesnt really matter if you get a really fun build together, because you wont have a chance to use it for long!\n\nHeres what I would have like to see from this game instead: A larger, more varied enemy pool. More weapons to have access to (How about some actual cool spells to cast, like a flamethrower, or a thunder cloud, or a frost blast? Call me old fashioned, but I wasn’t expecting the only weapon “spells” that would be available to you to just be pea shooters of differing colors where some have dots and some shotgun out more than others). More level variety - for example, not once did I run into a room that had both enemies AND traps in it at the same time. More options or variations on starting characters that make them actually feel different. And probably most importantly, let me play the “long game”! I want to see how far I can make in one go. The game could easily allow you to continue after you “beat” it, and then maybe allow you to unlock things as you go instead of forcing you to restart completely.\n\nAll in all, as much as I’m beating up in this game, its still fun. I just don’t want people to get the wrong idea and make it out as “the perfect new rouge-lite” as it seems many have been doing. So I haven’t even talked about its strengths, but that’s because I’ve talked long enough. Check out more positive reviews to see that, but just be warned, you may not end up getting enough bang for your buck in this one.\n\nEDIT: I'm aware that they have since added endless mode. It was not there on initial release at the time of my review. Considering I have no desire to play this game any longer, I will not be revisiting how it affects the game. I would reccomend watching or reading a more up-to-date review than my own should you be curious about this game.","October 27, 2014","false","7.1"," 532 of 815 people (65%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","65","532","815","12","47"

It's a first person shooter rogue-lite.  You get set into a dungeon with not much but a wand of piddly little magic missiles and set to fight your way through the floors.  There's a boss guarding the exit to each floor, and when you switch floors you can save and quit, but there's no way to save mid-floor.  Floors will take you between 7-14 minutes to clear for the first level, but get bigger and more complicated as you progress.\n\nThe game it reminds me most of is actually The Binding of Isaac.\n\nThe weapons are hugely varied, and all bar one of them are great fun to use.  And I'm sure I just haven't gotten the hang of the last one yet.  The way the weapon system works, with a limit of three different types of weapons (plus the wand), and shared ammunition for each type forces some great gameplay, deciding which of your weapons to use in which circumstances, and how much mana to save for the boss is great fun.  And whenever you come across a new weapon that replaces one you have, it's never a straight upgrade, there's always a trade off.  Sure, this one might do more damage up close, but that one freezes enemies solid so they can't attack you.  You have to judge which is more valuable for you: a little bit of control or faster damage.  And do your other weapons change that choice?\n\nEnemy types are similarly varied, and each class usually has a certain strategy that you can utilise to most effectively kill them.  This gets particularly fun when you come across enemies that require you to stay close to alongside ones you have to stay away from, and you find yourself stuck between two very painful places.\n\nThe unlocks come at a great pace, enough to keep you interested, but not so fast as to overwhelm.  You have plenty of time to get good with the weapons, amulets and characters you've unlocked as you go.\n\nWithin each run there is a great sense of progression.  You start off terribly weak and mana-starved, but if you make it to the third floor (an achievement unto itself) then you find that you have a huge arsenal of strengths.  But you can still die if you make a few too many mistakes.\n\nI am also a fan of the upgrade mechanics.  Finding raw damage enhancers is rare, and they usually come with a downside.  The most common way of increasing your damage output is through attack speed, but more attacks cost more mana, so that's not ideal either.\n\nSo is the game good?  Yes!  It's fantastic.  You run about on your adrenaline high, shooting colourful bolts of magic at creepy monsters until either they or you keels over.  You will need to be good to progress, but you have so many reasons to keep getting better.\n\nEasily one of my favourite games of this year.\n\n","November 3, 2014","true","76.2"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","33","36","0","0"

There are plenty of people who like this kind of game - I'm just not one of them.\n\nThe game does look good, and the enemies do indeed have a range of visual and behavioral styles. Especially in the area of the game's adversaries, I think the developers have done well. They've created hostile NPCs that are more than just damage sponges. Each enemy type has a distinct and quickly recognizable pattern of attack and defense. This creates opponents with signature styles, and in doing so, recalls the excellent design of classic games.\n\nThe problem, though, is that distinctive enemies are not enough to overcome the game's central premise. A central premise that is also Ziggurat's fatal flaw:\n\nThe entire game is, essentially, a "Luck-Based Mission" with permadeath as the penalty for bad luck.\n\nSuch a central premise can theoretically be done well. If the basic combat is incredibly fun, for instance, then a restart might not be so bad. If that really fun combat takes place in enormously varied environments, then that's even better.\n\nZiggurat fails to adequately deliver on either count. The combat is certainly good, but it's still too simplistic to hold up the entire experience on its own. The randomly chosen rooms differ from each other, but not enough to truly keep you guessing as to what you might find next.\n\nAnother problem is that "Luck-Based" is applied to pretty much everything. You can learn to be better at combat, but you can't really learn from your mistakes in terms of character build. That is, the weaponry you encounter and the perks you can add to your "skill tree" are randomized. As such, you can figure out what works for your play style...but you'd better enjoy it while it lasts, because you might not be able to get your hands on that combination of weapons and perks again.\n\nZiggurat isn't a bad game, but I just didn't find it engaging enough to offset its high cost of failure and the lack of any meaningful, repeatable gameplay choices.","November 24, 2014","false","1.5"," 168 of 262 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","168","262","5","7"

Surprisingly, the other game of theirs that I played, little racer street, I didn't like much. Reguardless, this is probably the best FPS rougelite on the market right now.\n\nIn Ziggurat you are dropped in a... well, Ziggurat. Which is simply a massive step pyramid with several layers. You travel through and try and complete as many levels as you can before you die, which is pretty common with rougelites/likes. One of the more interesting things about this game though, is not only do you start out with a base weapon, you get a random, more interesting weapon at the beginning and every new floor as well. With 4 weapon slots, one for your normal, one for your spells, one for your alchemy weapons, and another that I don't actually know what its called. It seems to be filled with staffs, so its probably for that. Anyway, once you get enough weapons the combat is very diverse. And even in the beginning you have 2 weapon choices, which makes it plenty of fun at the beginning.\n\nThe level up system and the enemy variation add plenty of reason to continue play. There are several different passive affects you can add to your character that will help you as you level, and keep things fresh. The enemy type is extremely varied and forces you to change your combat style every room. Keeps things fresh and fun on every run. There are also a ton of unlockables to keep you playing even after you've beaten the game, including 10(?) playable characters.\n\nThe art style is a cartoony high fantasy style which I enjoy. Reminds me of a Fable or Kingdoms of Amular, that sort of artstyle. I think it fits the game well and the interface is done quite well too.\n\nIf I had a complaint, it would probably be that I found it a bit too easy, at least so far. Roguelites/likes should have you spending hours learning the intricacies of the game and finding proper builds and weapons that work best for you. In this particular game though, I found myself beating the full game with one character in less than 3 hours. To me, that means your game needs some more meat. It has a lot, but I think it could use more difficulty.\n\nNow I don't hate the game at all, I love it. I think its one of the better roguelites I've played in quite a while. I would have loved to see more than 5 levels though. Anyway, one of my favorite roguelites I've played recently and you should definitely pick it up if you enjoy the genre. 15 bucks, or 12.74(its current price) is a steal for this very fun FPS rougelite.\n\nPros:\n-Shooting\n-Enemy variety\n-4 weapon slots with different mana pools\n-Save between levels\n-Art Style\n-Leveling system adds variation to runs\n-Good graphics/PC options\n\nCons:\n-Base game can be too easy\n-Too short(Only 5 levels)\n\nBuy At Full Price","October 29, 2014","true","3.2"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","34","40","0","1"

Ziggurat. How do I sum it up, in short, it's Hexen. Given a coat of paint, made modern, put in a pseudo-random roguelike coat of armour and sent trundling out into the world. You pick a class (initially one, but there's a ton of unlockable classes which add a wide range of variety and options) and you enter the ziggurat, a five (or six in hard mode) floor chock full of things to kill, loot to gather, and levels to gain. You'll pick up a variety of interesting weapons which depending on what you find will define your playstyle, and you'll grab level up perks and various boons and debuffs which will customise your experience with each run. As is normal for a roguelike, when you die, that's it, your score is totted up, and you're sent back to the beginning.\n\nSo, is it any good?\n\nOh god is it good. Seriously, stop reading, go to the buy button, press it, smear money on your screen, buy it now. Buy it this instant, no, really, I'm not kidding. If you loved Hexen, or Heretic, you do not need to read any further, if you love old school FPS games, you do not need to read any further, if you love hard FPS games which do not involve regenerating health and re-introduce the concept of circle strafing (because you'll be doing a lot of that), then you do not need to read any further.\n\nThe graphics are lush and detailed, with plenty of enemy variety now, there's skeletons, slimes, goblins, orcs, demons and carrots, yes, carrots. Carniverous blighters that will eat your eyeballs given half a chance. The enemies do a decent enough job, the AI is simple, but effective, melee mobs will charge at you and wail on you, ranged mobs will hang back and shoot at you. There's enough going on that you're never given much peace once the room locks down and the arena for that given room is up and running, and the room layouts are varied with enough visual detail and variation that you won't get bored. These are places you will enjoy roaming through, the ziggurat is well textured and the tileset has a nice feel to it, the connecting corridors are more than just bolt-ons that connect the rooms together, they have incidental detail too, and on occasion come complete with traps to catch out the unwary.\n\nSound is reasonable, it does the job, the weapons are meaty enough, the creatures are varied in their noises, and the background incidentals are all fine and well, there's some background music when it's needed but this is not a game that drowns you in sound, it's there, it does what it needs to do, that's about the size of it. Gameplay however is -stellar-, the controls are tight and responsive, shooting feels satisfying and tactile, and there's a pleasing feel to all the spells available, you'll quickly find favourites and ones you detest, and you'll grit your teeth if you get a bad draw, but you'll jump for joy if you get the ones you want.\n\nThe bosses put in a reasonable show, each having their own quirks as well as being solid bullet sponges and being a good test to ensure that you do know how to avoid big nasty fire as it comes heading your way, the challenge really ramps up in the last couple of floors, with damage coming thick and fast and specific builds coming into their own (hint : bloodlust).\n\nThe sheer variety of classes, coupled with perks and the number of additional features the developers have crammed in over the life of early access (the number of weapons now is something like 28 or so split over the three types - spell, stave and alchemy) such as challenge rooms, shrine rooms, trap rooms, obelisks and so on, and the additional decorations and incidental detail, the developers clearly made this a labour of love. This is the game they -wanted- to make, and it shows.\n\nIn short, if you have a love for shooters, particularly if you have any recollection of Hexen or Heretic, you owe it to yourself to buy this game, you will not regret it. This Tiger approves, and will see you in the tower, best of luck.","October 23, 2014","true","31.7"," 54 of 74 people (73%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","73","54","74","9","13"

Well, for one thing, it's actually pretty good. In fact, I would go as far as saying that it's one of the best rogue-lites that you can buy on Steam. Though it borrows a lot from other rogue-lites (which in turn borrow a number of key concepts from actual rogue-likes), it also has some Heretic and Hexen thrown in, and not just in terms of visuals, but also in terms of gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay of Ziggurat is quite simple. It's a combination of a rogue-like dungeon crawl mixed in with an FPS. Along the way, you will be leveling up your character, dying from enemy fire, unlocking new perks and weapons (as well as the occasional character), and starting from ground zero all over again. When it comes to basic FPS mechanics, the game does everything correctly, and the controls are also well tuned. The perks in this game range from your basic "magic meter increase" and "better healing" to perks that can negatively impact one aspect of your character while improving another aspect of your character, which may or may not ♥♥♥♥ your ♥♥♥♥ up. In addition to these perks, there are also rooms your character can pray at to gain temporary and permanent perks in the form of "divine blessings", although these same statues can also give you "divine punishment", which affects your character negatively, or a divine indifference, which affects you in both a positive and negative way. These statues can also refill your health or mana meters and give you new items. Although you will probably never be able to use or find all the weapons in the game in a single playthrough (assuming you managed to unlock all the weapons in the game), I was quite surprised over how many weapons there are in the game. There are four primary weapon types, and although the usefulness of some of these weapons is debatable, most of the weapons I have used have helped me in my playthroughs in one way or another. As far as characters go, you only have one to play with in the beginning, though you unlock more as you complete certain prerequisites. Each character has some variation in between then, with one character being the "balanced" type, while another character being the "speed demon" type, and some characters might be proficient in either one or more magic types. However, the gameplay still remains very similar even when playing other characters. The level system in this game is pretty basic, as it increases your mana pool and your HP and then has you chose a perk. Of course, there is an aspect to it that irks me, and that aspect is not being able to directly chose what perks you want. In fact, each time you upgrade a character, you have two perks to chose from (three with the help of an unlockable perk), and those perks are randomly chosen. Why does this irk me? Well, its probably because it doesn't allow for total control of your character in terms of character progression. I understand that rogue-likes certainly have a luck factor, and I also understand how some of that luck factor carries over into rogue-lites. However, contrary to popular belief, not every factor in a rogue-like is based on luck, and yes, that includes character building (assuming the rogue-like lets you control what your stat points and/or skill points go into, which a lot of rogue-likes do). This to me feels like a half-♥♥♥♥♥ attempt at character building with player input. Either give me full control of what perks and skills I can learn and/or give me full control of where I can put my stat points into, or don't give me full control of those options at all. Also, the traps are kinda lame, as they are not that difficult to pass through once you get their patterns down.\n\nIn terms of presentation, optimization and sound, Ziggurat is mostly good. The graphics are very solid, and most of the character models are pleasant to look at. The game also manages to be pretty well optimized, and has some essential settings. The only thing that I didn't like too much in this category is the sound, as the music is quite meh.\n\nEven though the game has a number of quirks, Ziggurat is a well put-together rogue-lite that is definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a very good rogue-lite fix, and fans of FPS games and actual rogue-likes might enjoy this as well.","December 21, 2014","true","9.3"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","0"

This is the only way out, if you succeed, your masters will give you access to unlimited powers but if you fail... your bones will join the pile of those who tried before you.\n\n\nThe layout:\n\nZiggurat is a "rogue-lite" first person shooter mixed with rpg elements. You can choose different wizards with their own skills. From the Apprentice, the well balanced to the Alchemist expert of explosions or the Vampire with more health but cursed by his origins... You can find the one that suits your tastes.\n\nZiggurat fights acts around weapons, shown as wands (the basic one cost no mana), scepters (in general fast and versatile), spell books (more specific but powerful), or alchemical devices (in general can be compared to explosives with bigger area of effect).\nYour ammo are different colors of mana that you can loot in containers or on dead enemies. Green for scepters, blue for spell books, and orange for alchemy.\n\nIn fact you will find everything that made the glory of old shooters such as Quake, Doom or Hexen.\nThe only difficult thing is that not every weapon is easy to use or effective. Add to that the fact that many wizard have preferred mana, quite often you will have to be lucky to find the appropriate weapon.\nThe learning curve is slow and difficult, be prepared to face many failure in front of your enemies.\n\nBy talking about enemies, they are powerful, numerous, and ... they look like pokemons!\n\nFrankly, it's the only game i've played where even if you rant quite often, you find monsters funny and cute.\nLike the carrots that runs toward you like berserkers, the living group of mushrooms, or the slimes who seems to smile at out ...\n\nMovements and perfect use of your weapons are necessary to beat them. Ziggurat is a hardcore game where fights are tight and requires skill. Every monster have spells that can reach you in many ways, so in general if you meet a new monster, you will have to get how to dodge his attacks and be able to land your hits without wasting your ammo/mana.\n\nIn fact this is the most difficult aspect of the game. Because dodging is already hard but keeping mana pools enough filled to fight all the way is another story.\n\nTo help you in your adventures you will be able to collect experience crystals on enemies and gain levels. Each level gives you more health and let you choose between 2 cards. Each can give you new skills to help you in your fights.\nYou can even choose between 3 cards instead of 2. Cards gives you more mana, more health or special skills such as telekinesis to get exp crystal from afar or reduce cost when you use a weapon. There are tons of cards to find and it's a real pleasure to discover new ones.\n\nEach characters has a "deck” of skills that you can upgrade with the new cards you find.\nIt's automatic, but even if you die every runs into the Ziggurat makes you stronger, you can get new heroes as well depending of what you've done into the Ziggurat (you have to find the way to unlock them).\n\nAdd to that talismans, they give beneficial effects such as protections, manas or health.\nYou can find them in special rooms where you have to move across traps to reach a treasure.\nSome characters can even start with a talisman or cards can give you the choice to get a talisman or change the one you already have.\n\nThis won't be too much to face the bosses of Ziggurat... in fact they remind me those of Painkiller.\nWith less health, you still have to run, jump, shoot like a devil. They have few attacks but in general they can spawn enemies around them. If you consider that nearly all of the bosses have attacks with area of effects... you can already guess that bosses fights are really hard. 3 different bosses per levels.\n\n\nTo finish all level are random generated, you can (you need to !) find secret rooms to get cards and know some funny facts about Milky stone, or you can use God altars to bet health, mana or nothing to get bonuses or afflictions.\n\n\nTo conclude:\n\nZiggurat is an excellent game. A perfect example of a rogue-lite shooter, the kind of game for real gamer. Beautiful, deep, hard as hell and with weird monsters. It will keep you busy for a while.\nThe only bad aspect is maybe the lack of accuracy during jumps or some rooms wich are horribly difficult to manage during tight fights. Like some rooms with stairs everywhere or when you run and get stuck in door frames!\n\nOr some wizard who are just "cooler" than the others, such as the Novice. She is the best, in my humble point of view.\n\nSo "WILL YOU CHALLENGE THE ZIGGURAT ?"\n\nN.B: The replay value is very high, dozen of hours to master every weapons, characters, monsters bosses. Maybe one of the most interresting shooters on steam in 2015.\nPlus they've added during 2015 summer: daily challenges, new monsters, 4 new bosses (the Carrot Boss is here !!!), new characters and perks.

Perks will help you in your adventure, but what really matters is the way you play. The lost art of circle strafing is back!\n\nGame consists in find a book that will spawn the boss of that floor.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cybs/recommended/308420/","Cybs","Yass Cookie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cybs/","279 products in account","http://youtu.be/JK6clRDBwzQ\n\nFirst person shooter rogue-like games are absolutely rubbish, mostly due to the lack of polish and performance. They are usually clunky and under perform in every instance, but Ziggurat has blown that whole misconception out of the water. This nicely polished game has been developed by the independent team over at Milkystone studios and they have struck gold with the development of this title.\n\nZiggurat came up out of the blue for me and I absolutely love that, being able to trawl through the steam store and finding gems like this is fantastic. With all the flaws steam has it redeems itself with creating a platform for indie developers to showcase their games.\n\nYou take control of a character that possess different abilities which aid you through your adventure or disadvantage you in some cases. As with most rogue-like games the difficulty scales upwards when you venture deeper into the dungeon, enemies become more complex and you need to formulate strategies to progress or with WILL die. The game revolves around magic which makes for a great foundation for a rogue-like. Exploring deeper into the dungeon you find perks that enhance your character, examples include, increasing mana pools, health, damage or speed, finding secret rooms, sacrificing resource for luck or other resources.  The amount of customization of your character is endless which makes for amazing replayability.\n\nThe levels are randomly generated like most rogue-like titles are. Venturing through these dungeons you can come across any number of rooms such as; labyrinths, trap rooms, secrets and other mysterious encounters. Finding secrets is one of the most thrilling things you can do in any rogue-like, but in Ziggurat finding secret rooms reward you with perks that are usually only obtainable through levelling up which just adds to the enjoyment or frustration when you eventually die and lose everything that you had.\n\nZiggurat also has some puzzle and platforming elements which are actually integrated pretty well into the title. Discovering a lava room with some moving platforms makes the player realize that this game is not all about killing monsters and obtaining loot, but more of a mental challenge as well.\n\nHaving enemies with depth and varied abilities is almost a staple in any great rogue-like game, this demands the player to tackle the room in different ways to counter the enemy types. No one play through will ever be the same due to this feature. Enemies range from murderous carrots all the way to giant blue blobs which will devour you if you’re stupid enough to approach it.\n\nWhen entering the dungeon you are given a stock standard wand that does suffice for the first level or two, but the game really starts to get interesting when you need better weapons for the upcoming fights; so you desperately look in every last corner for weapons and spells that will make you so much stronger than you were before.  The mana pool is in 4 separate parts; purple, orange, blue and green. These colours represent what kind of damage is dished out by the different weapons that use the respective mana pool. MANA is depleted extremely fast which makes for some daring decisions to run head on into enemies to grab that extra mana that is needed for you to use your magic.\n\nThe game looks amazing; the texture quality of pretty much everything has this kind of cartoony feel about it, but it also has a great feel and atmosphere towards it. The model design is quite good also, having many close encounters with the enemies you can see that the design quality is very high and this is something that usually falls behind when talking about FPS Rogue-likes, but Ziggurat pulls it off quite nicely.\n\nFinding loot is probably the most exciting part of the game. Finding items and perks for the first time always creates mystery to the run. Being able to apply different weapons to your strategy and rotation makes you play differently in every room. The weapons feel awesome, the weight and different specifications of each spell and weapon makes for a good time.\n\nIf you’re into FPS or rogue-like games you should definitely check out this title even if it’s just for the innovation alone, you will not be disappointed. The mixture of great level design, graphics, sound quality and great loot really makes for a fun experience.\n","October 24, 2014","true","11.5"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","30","40","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/308420/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Ziggurat is a FPS roguelite game made by Milkstone Studios (White Noise Online, Little Racers Street). As the subgenre suggests, this game feels a lot like a well-thought combination of The Binding of Isaac and Serious Sam (or Painkiller).\n\nLevels are splitted into procedurally generated rooms where you'll usually find a large group of enemies. You'll beat those in aggressive action style with a lot of jumping and shooting - but as Ziggurat is placed in fantasy setting, you'll be using wands, spells, staffs, and alchemists' inventions for attacks.\n\nThe game has nice polished comic style that looks great, same goes for the specific level designs - there isn't a huge amount of room designs but still, from those you'll be able to enter and see, they are nice. Most have some traps, lava pools, platforms or just simple height differences (and stairs).\n\nZiggurat also has RPG features, as you collect experience from dead enemies to gain higher levels. With every new level, you pick a perk that will make you character stronger in specific way but sadly, most perks are just passive utility upgrades that boost your health or mana pool (there's unique mana pool for every weapon type). You won't get much opportunity to upgrade your damage, so it's more about player's skill because you can't get overpowered and you can always die pretty easily if you won't dodge enemy attacks.\n\nFor my first run I got really excited of the game. But as I progressed through more runs, it started feeling too much repetitive - and there's a reason for it. Even though the rooms in levels (and their contents) are randomly generated, levels overall feel too much similar. There's low variety of enemies, even the level bosses are just upgraded versions of regular NPCs (except the final boss). Same applies for weapons, you won't care later about your weapons because every weapon shoots effectively, so you just pick what you can to kill everybody around.\n\nConclusion:I think the Ziggurat is a nice roguelite game, though it's ended behind other games in the genre, as it's missing the most important thing for rougelike games - big replayability that won't make you bored fast. It's a nice game and you'll like it, but you need to set your expectations low.

Combine these varied weapon types with perks ranging from rather basic improvements to others that change your whole style of play and you'll have a lot of interesting runs thrown at you.\n\nThe fact that weapons and perks are randomized might rub you the wrong way if you take this game too seriously or if you want it to be more of an action RPG than a rogue-lite. For everyone else though this just means that you'll have to adapt to what the game is giving you in order to succeed.\n\nTL;DR:\n- It has varied weapons that are fun to use and interesting perks.\n- It's very randomized.

All weapons are projectile-based, but some feature area of effect damage or spread functionality. Weapons are varied enough to keep things interesting.\nNumerous procedurally generated rooms that offer a strong challenge in the sense of number of enemies or traps to avoid\nProgression is rewarded with abilities that make give the player mild advantages.\nFor example: Health will restore slightly when entering a new combat room. This is a great ability as health potion drops are very infrequent\nThere are also permanent progression unlocks in the form of new characters, which feature different starting abilities\nAll of these choices drastically impact your play through and add a wonderful level of strategy to the gameplay\nThe game is challenging in a way that requires you to constantly be aware of your surroundings. You can quickly find yourself cornered or stuck on a pillar, which could equal your demise. I found the difficulty suspenseful and rewarding, which are the reasons I enjoy PDLs so much.\nThe art style is Gothic, which lends to the overall archaic design of the maps. You feel as though magic is a common companion to this game world, which appears to be the subject matter\nThere are many different enemy types and some creative ones as well (I’m looking at you weird floating whale creature), which all have different battle tactics. Facing a new enemy is both fascinating and frustrating.\nThere are also boss battles, which offer variations of other enemy-types you’ve faced off against. They are large and difficult to overcome, which again adds to the satisfaction when you beat them.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe game has an ending, but doesn’t offer much in the way of end-game content after you do so. There is no New Game+ or added bosses (think Binding of Isaac). Once you’ve beaten the game there is little motivation to return to it. A successful run can take as short as a couple hours, which is disappointing considering how much content this game features\nPuzzle sections feature FPS platforming, which I feel is always a difficult mechanic to pull off. Since you can’t see your feet, timing your jumps with the location of your player’s body is tedious and unnecessarily frustrating.\nGameplay itself can get stale, as once you’ve seen all the weapons there is little variation to the strategy. Dash around and shoot at all the enemies then jump around a frustrating platforming puzzle then repeat.\n\nCan you play it while the children are awake?\n\nThe monsters are creepy and well designed and as I mentioned above there is a strong Gothic influence, which can create a scary atmosphere. I would say it is fine for older children, but the younger ones may let their imagination run wild and be scared of the content.\n\nDid I make time to complete it?\n\nYes. It took me a few hours to run through the entire game. Unfortunately, there was little incentive for me to return.\n\nRecommended Purchase Price:\n\nZiggurat is an easy sell for someone who is both a fan of First Person Shooters and Procedural Death Labyrinths, there is much here to like. Whether it is the well crafted progression system, enemy type variation, random room generation, fast and crazy projectile combat, or the enjoyment of defeating a particularly difficult boss you’ll find something to enjoy! The only caveat to this would be the replayability of Ziggurat, as once you’ve completed the game there is little reason to return.

I strongly approve.\n\nGame's really smooth, -- at least, as smooth as you'd allow a rogue-like (or rather rogue-lite) to be at all. Graphics and the game engine itself are pretty good. Some (most, actually) of the monster animations are really simpistic, but that's not a bad thing, really (you don't expect a rogue-like to have state-of-art graphics, do you?). Most possibly, this is a first first-person rogue-lite out there too, by the way.\n\nGameplay is really simple: you're opening door after door on a floor, killing monsters, gathering loot (new spells/weapons, new items), leveling up (and getting 1 of 2 perks each level -- Crimsonland much?). In order to transfer to the next level, you must kill the boss. In order to do that, you must locate: a) an exit (or a boss room, if you like); b) token to open it. Each floor is procedurally generated -- monsters, spells, rooms and settings are randomized. This means, every time you're starting over, you're getting a new map to explore.\n\nBy dying you'll lose your progress, but as of what I've seen, there's a total of 5 levels in the dungeon, so the game's main feature is starting it over and over again -- unlocking new classes, new weapons, new items and filling the lore book with new pages -- and getting basically a new experience every time.\n\nIf you're a fan of rogue-likes, or if you ever played games like Hexen and Heretic, this game certainly is a "must play".\n\nI'd rate this game 8.5 out of 10.0.","January 21, 2015","true","3.5"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

For my personally it is one of the few that has really hit the mark.\n\nZiggurat combines twitch fps controls with fantasy elements in a seemless way. You fight through randomly generated floors that feature a handfull of different types of rooms, enemies and bosses. As you progress in the game you unlock more items, characters, and abilities that will add to a pool of randomized items, changing the game as you sink more hours into it.\n\nThe game has three difficulties, Easy, Normal and Hard. Even on easy difficulty the game takes some getting used to and can be quite challenging. Normal difficulty is where it really starts to kick your butt, however. Hard mode is something else entirely. The amount of content in the game may be concerning to some, as you only fight through five floors which may be off-putting. I can assure fans of the roguelite genre that the game feels whole.

You are never going to have the same level twice.  Some reviews have stated it's like Heretic or Hexen.  This game is not Heretic or Hexen.  But in a world where Triple A developers are advertising their games as "Like Skyrim but with Guns and Vehicles" could you really blame anyone for comparing this to Heretic or Hexen?  Sure it plays similar to an old school FPS.  Secret Areas (1 per level).  Able to carry more than 2 weapons.  Just because you play as a wizard doesn't make it like Heretic.\n\nI think any fan of old school FPS will enjoy this game, it doesn't have the same strafing speed that we had in the 90's but it's definitely a fresh breath of air in a genre that has been decimated by the likes of modern military FPS.  For $15 dollars you'll get more than your money's worth.  This game could be replayed over and over again.  I think even fans of Minecraft or other Roguelike games where the world is randomly generated will enjoy Ziggurat.\n\nOverall this is one of the best indie FPS I've played all year.  (2014)  I wouldn't let it pass you by.  If you can get it on sale then great, but if not like I said, this is definitely worth the full price.","November 25, 2014","true","26.5"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

Every enemy and pretty much every environment texture looks like it was pulled straight out of WoW, or that it would fit perfectly in it. It gives an otherwise potentially atmospheric and gruesome game a childish, out-of-character cartoony vibe.\n-Essentially no environmental interaction. No "use" button, for instance, because there is nothing to use. No switches, no mechanisms, etc.\n-Essentially puzzleless. "Puzzles" consist of jumping onto moving platforms, which there is nothing inherently wrong with, but its not enough all by itself.\n-Weaponry is not differentiated enough. In addition, almost all secondary attack modes for weapons just launch a volley of the base attack projectile, or if not a volley, a bigger single projectile. Not very creative.\n-Lack of core level content.\n-The game is compared to Hexen and Heretic at times. Only superficially is it like Hexen, and while closer to Heretic, it does not capture its essence.\n-Randomized map layouts selecting from pre-made rooms do not qualify a game as a Rogue-anything.\n-Some clipping issues and strange and/or lacking collision boxes.\n\n\nNeutral:\n\n-Perk system needs creative elements injected into it. Its not bad, but its nothing special either. Its kinda "standard", and does not stand out.\n-The different characters need to be more differentiated at their core levels.\n-I feel the AI needs to be more complex; more advanced in its functioning.\n-I feel there needs to be a crouch button for some reason.... probably because of the FPS nature of the game. While they are at it, they mind as well throw in leaning as well (it would come in handy frequently).\n-Item decay is very annoying. Im not sure what that mechanic adds to the game.\n\nComents:\n\nI had very high hopes for Ziggurat, seeing it being compared to Hexen and Heretic, and touted as a "rogue-lite", but after a couple hours, I became quite disappointed with the game.\n\nI remember Hexen vividly, and comparing Ziggurat to Hexen is not really appropriate except in the most superficial of ways, such as the mana system used for weapons. In that regard, yes, Ziggurat fully borrowed from Hexen. But thats pretty much it. It is much closer to Heretic, which was basically an overhauled Doom with a mystical bent added. But for some reason, battles just fall short of being interesting in Ziggurat. Maybe its the total lack of blood and gore... or believable art.\n\nHonestly I got a Serious Sam sense from the game several times, which I felt was very out of place.\n\nAnd I have not found many distinguishing Rogue-anything elements in Ziggurat. For anyone whose played Nethack, ADOM, or similar, expect virtually no significant resemblence whatsoever, either in actual gameplay, or in spirit. I do not think Ziggurat falls into any rogue subgenre.\n\nI am mostly bummed about the lack of rogue-anything qualities in the game. I was under the impression that it was going to be much deeper and more indepth than it turned out to be. I was also fooled by the reviews saying this game had atmosphere and great art direction. Ziggurat definitely does have atmospheric potential... but one thing that hinders that potential is the "great art", which doesnt particularly make me feel very immersed in the game because it breaks my suspension of disbelief that what Im seeing could actually be real. It never feels like it COULD be real... it always feels... like a cliched and trite childrens cartoon at this point.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nI unfortunately cannot recommend this game as its being sold, at the price it is being sold at.\n\nThere is potential in this style of game... in this dungeon crawler shoot-em-up... but Ziggurat falls short of hitting the mark of a defining game for the sub-sub-genre, and instead becomes a mash-up of many different disparate genres that doesnt do any particular one of them very well.\n\n---\n\nJan 22nd 2015 Update: Replaying Ziggurat for some hours today, I still feel the above accurately describes my thoughts on the game. I amended the positive section to say that the sound/music was very good, instead of just good. The sound team/person did a very good job.\n\nI still wish the art direction had taken a darker, more sinister route. If it had, I probably would have been able to forgive the lack of content and lack of environmental interaction if a suitably dark atmosphere was produced, and give a positive recommendation. But as it stands, I still do not recommend the game the way it is marketed (its not a rogue-anything), nor as it is touted (its neither a literal nor spiritual successor to Hexen or Heretic).","January 2, 2015","false","18.8"," 134 of 239 people (56%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","56","134","239","6","11"

It really is, except it's much shorter, is a dungeon crawler, and has light RPG elements.  Ziggurat is one of those games where you die a lot, but every time you do, you will have learned something about enemies or what to expect from certain rooms.  Easy to learn and difficult to master.\n\nYou get experience killing things and when you level up you choose a card which is basically a passive perk.  There are only 3 weapon types aside from your starting weapon but there is a fair amount of variety.  Even though there are only 5 floors to the dungeon, the longevity comes from completing the challenges required to unlock new characters.  Each character has different starting stats or an affinity with a certain kind of weapon type.  All these things add to the replay value.  There is a fair amount of skill required to finish all 5 floors but some of it comes down to luck, too.  As of this writing, I finished the game as the Novice, and while I'm eager to try out some of the new characters I unlocked, I'm already beginning to question how much longer I'll really be interested.","October 24, 2014","true","15.1"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

Visually after three games you've seen it all, walls over walls over staircases.\nRegarding Game Design it's even worse. Not only are there so incredibly few enemies in that game, but also almost none of them require any specific approach. Just shoot, walk sidewards and you're fine. Same with bosses: no "sore" points to shoot, no tricks or strategies to learn. Don't even try beeing fancy, just shoot!\nWhat bothers me most is the shooting itself. It just doesn't feel as rewarding as in games like Diablo or Serious Sam, it's rather very indirect, there is almost no feedback on how hard you've hit or not, or how injured the enemy is. Games which are all about slaughtering hundreds of enemies just need to be satisfying about it, otherwise there's not much left.\nIn addition the RPG system is rather simple and the weapons pretty much all serve the same purpose.\n\nIt's these two things i miss about the game, the replayability and the depth. Otherwise you get a simple, solid Shoot ’em Up as they have always been there.","October 26, 2014","false","5.6"," 61 of 106 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","61","106","0","0"

FPSes are built around carefully-crafted encounters where enemies can present interesting challenges for the player to overcome, so randomizing those elements leaves a lot of room for missteps. The developers behind Ziggurat somehow found a way to make it all work, and wrapped it up in a clean, colorful package that is almost impossible to put down.\n\nThe titular ziggurat is an ever-changing magical labyrinth that serves as the final (and potentially fatal) exam for your mage guild. Armed with only your trusty wand, you must descend through five sprawling floors of monsters and treasure to defeat the guardian and claim your place as a proper wizard. Defeating monsters (and exploring, on occasion) earns you experience that lets you pick a perk when you level up, which can range from a simple stat boost to a permanent mutator on your movement or attacks. There's a lot of space for different builds if you get the right cards, providing some welcome variety even on the same character. Even better then that there are a dozen different characters to unlock and choose from, each with even more dramatic differences right from the start.\n\nAnd that's just your character! There's a huge assortment of weapons to find, spread across three different archetypes. You have spellbooks, which usually have short-range shotgun-style area effects, staves, which tend to be more accurate and rapid-fire, and alchemy, which covers all sorts of guns and grenades. Every level is guaranteed to have one random weapon and you can only hold one of each type, so a big part of the strategy is forming a complimentary arsenal out of your limited, randomized options. There are also amulets that provide powerful, sporadic effects, and shrines that can provide limited bonuses in exchange for certain sacrifices. The more you play, the more perks, weapons, and amulets get added to the pool, and after a dozen hours there's still plenty more for me to find.\n\nSo there's plenty of variety on your end, but what about the enemies? You'll encounter two dozen flavors of fanciful, murderous creatures on each run, as well as an assortment of challenging bosses. Pretty much any attack pattern you can imagine is represented, and enemy groups can be mixed all sorts of ways. Then there are champion monsters that are faster or have special auras, and room effects that boost EVERYONE'S damage or cause visual effects. Levels should take about 10 minutes each to finish, give or take depending on how much exploring you do. Part of that decision is going to be based on how you're holding up, because one bad combination of enemies can really mess you up... the rooms are all arena-style, so once you enter, you're not leaving until you wipe 'em all out.\n\nWith such a huge volume of content, Ziggurat is a shooter that can last you dozens of hours. The wide variety of characters, perks, weapons, and enemy groups to use them on will keep you busy for ages, and there are difficulty levels and daily challenges on top of all that. The bright, colorful fantasy graphics and rich sound are the perfect icing on this enormous cake. If modern roguelike Heretic sounds like a good time to you, and there's no reason it shouldn't, pick this one up as soon as you can.","December 19, 2015","true","19.9"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

Afterwards I found the last boss to be unfair and the re-clearing of the rooms to be tedious. It looks great and is fast paced but I just don't enjoy playing it - even for a short dash.\n\nThe movement and aiming is fun and very satisfying however .. how can I show my skill, kite and abuse my freeze gun if some of the enemies have a burst/leap or cannot be frozen. This results in me running in circles and firing until my ammo is empty. And believe you me, using the basic wand is as much fun as shooting a tank in BattleField with a pistol.\n\nI do understand the properties of a rouge-like game. However... most of the time I don't even have all three guns  (i.e. max equipment) or only get the ones I already have. Finding the right ammo is random. Sometimes you just cannot win.\n\nSo far, I found the cards (skills or power-ups) you get for a level-up quite uninspired: more hp, more ammo, more xp, change ammo reservoirs ... I feel there was so much potential for interesting mods or trade-offs. Maybe you have to unlock them, however I don't intend to grind just to see it getting slightly better.\n\nI think it is worth a try for 50% off (7,50€).

Unlocked new characters, however, e.g. it says "learns faster than others". Instead of simply telling you the characters starts with "scholar" on lvl 4.

The maze is divided into 5 different floors, with a boss at the end of each floor. On every floor you fight enemies, obtain loot, level up to chose perks and you try to get as far as you can. There's a base weapon every class has, and there's the 3 magic disciplines: spell, staff and alchemy. After you pick a class at the start of a new game (each with unique abilities and such) you try your best to make it through the maze.\n\nAll the classes you can pick are insanely fun to play. They all have their different starting attributes, different unique base weapon (the wand) spells and different starting perks. Not one character feels boring and un-inspired. It's truly a blast to play all of them! You unlock more as you play through the game.\n\nThe enemies are varied and fun, and thanks to all the different weapons / spells you have, you can pull off some combinations in combat. My favorite is a scepter that slows opponent, and then get up close with a devestating spell. There's so many weapons and combinations to try it, it's amazing! It's fun to try things out and mix magic, and the game feels responsive and there's no hardships in controlling.\n\nSo combat / control wise, it's pretty much perfect. The levels all look amazing (truly, the graphics are really, REALLY pretty) though their design originally left something to be desired. Earlier, you'd often encounter the same rooms during playthroughs, sometimes even twice on the same floor, but as of the update on 6 november this has changed. A lot of new rooms have been added, now featuring floating pieces of land that you have to jump onto to get items or boss keys, rooms with huge height differences and stairs and other awesome additions! Therefore, my earlier criticism of there being too few rooms and too much of the same has been removed; level design is now great!\n\nDepending on your playstyle (amount of rooms seen, monsters killed etc) you will be given an ending to your story, which can differ per person. I got the worst ending the first time around, which left me really bummed out, but there's more endings than that luckily!\n\nTruly, this is my favorite roguelite I've played in a very long time.

Lots of frantic running around. Very nice aesthetic style. It's like Painkiller or Serious Sam except you're a WIZARD which is much better automatically. Very fun in general.\n\nRANDOM DETAILS: It's a roguelike (or rogue-lite) which does NOT require "grinding" to win, although you do unlock some "side grades" like other skills, weapons, and classes. It took about 5 hours to win the first time on "normal" difficulty, and also unlock about half the unlockables. Haven't tried hard mode yet. I wouldn't have won on normal if I didn't get lucky with skill choices. I think the "tough skin" skill might be over powered a bit. The game is generally difficult, which is good. It also keeps track of which difficulty you've won at for EACH class, which increases replayability.\n\nCOMPLAINTS are minor, and I'm mostly listing them in case the dev reads reviews: There aren't many skill choices at first (more unlock through gameplay), which feels a bit bland. The optional trap rooms usually involve platforming, which sucks in every FPS, so I ignore them. Picking up xp/items can be annoying when they're dropped in the middle of enemies who keep spawning or doing AOE attacks, since drops disapear in a few seconds. The writing is sub-par.\n\nEDIT: Removed some complaints: You can see your picked skills by pressing "U". The seemingly unavoidable AOE attacks from some bosses can be mostly avoided by jumping. Most hazard rooms can be sprinted through before the traps activate.","October 25, 2014","true","29.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","2"

Simply put, it's an incredible game. I've never really liked the "rogue-like" genre to much. But mix it with an FPS (that doesn't look like doodoo) and have sweet sweet rewards like skills and perks after each play (and during play) and you get a winning combination. The game also looks good, it has a very nice art style overall. But the lighting effects and some of the textures (note: note all but it's a nitpick) are simply stunning to look at.\n\nAs per the usual rogue-like way, you get permadeath and all that good stuff also. You unlock different characters to play with by completing certain tasks such as completing the game, or doing a certain amount of kills using a wand or specific weapon type etc. Just a nice bonus to the character system imo.\n\nAlso it must be said, the developer(s) is super involved with the community so far. He answers forum threads quickly, and has added and removed things that people asked for. Now that the game is out of EA, the only thing I hope he adds is a bit more content. As it is, you only get the 5 floors to play through (which is hard enough mind you) right now. Workshop support would be ideal, but that's probably wishful thinking.\n\nNeedless to say, I highly recommend this game.","October 23, 2014","true","11.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/308420/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nZiggurat is a fast paced first person shooter set in a randomly generated dungeon. No, you won’t be shooting with guns. In this game you play as a sorcerer and therefore you’ll be using a wand, grenades and spells to complete your task. You have to fight yourself through 5 floors filled with traps, enemies and bosses.\n\nBut before you’re ready to take on the final boss you have to become stronger. This is done by killing enemies and collecting their dropped items. Dropped items consist of experience points, health or energy for your weapons. Pick up enough experience points and you’ll level up. Each time you level up your health meter will increase but you’ll also be able to pick a perk that might make things easier for you, or more difficult if you’re looking for a challenge. Unfortunately, the current set of ‘starting’ perks isn’t all that interesting and I wish there was more variety and depth in this system. I think the system itself works very well, by the way.  And on the other hand, the game’s focus lies on skill instead of random attributes so I understand the developer’s choice but right now, whenever you have to pick between two perks, most people will automatically choose the one that makes it easier for them. And rightfully so. But I want the choice between those two to be more difficult or I want these perks to have more impact.\nHowever, I did notice - after completing the game - that there are still tens of perks to be unlocked so who knows, maybe there already are harder choices to be made, but I just haven’t gotten to that part yet.\nI shouldn’t forget to mention that you can also find treasure chests and book pages scattered across the levels. The latter gives you more information about the world, the level you’re on or the enemies that you will encounter.\n\nAnyway, energy is used for your weapons; your default wand will automatically recharge when it’s not in use but your other weapons rely on magic fragments that will replenish their meters when picked up. This is a clever mechanic from keeping the game too simple because these other weapons you pick up obviously inflict more damage than your starting weapon. So you have to regularly switch between weapons, depending on the sort of enemy of course.\n\nLet me tell you that this game is just beautiful. It’s beautifully textured, the enemies are well animated and look amazing, but what impressed me most was the bosses. I think they stood out more than anything and the little intro you see before you head into battle makes it even better. I was a little disappointed to see the game had only 5 boss fights (I didn’t know the game had only 5 levels, you see), but I guess more floors, enemies and especially bosses can (and hopefully will) be added later on. And maybe I haven’t seen all there is to it yet, even though I did finish the story. Maybe there already are more floors depending on what character you play with, I don’t know.\nThe audio is also great. The game has this subtle ambiance. Voice acting for the enemies is generally well done, and the music suits the game, with the tempo slightly increasing whenever a battle takes place.\n\nAnd yup, you’ve read it correctly. You’ll unlock plenty of stuff by just playing. I finished the game on my first try so there isn’t much replay value for me right now, but should you die often you’ll eventually unlock new characters and perks that will help you in your quest.\nA game can be completed within 1-2 hours, if your skill is high enough (even less if you don’t explore). You can then start again with a new character. Unfortunately, there isn’t a whole lot of stuff to do for gamers who’ve already finished it, except for unlocking more stuff and trying to climb up the Leaderboards. It would’ve been nice to see the game mix things up, like adding tougher enemies or extra environmental hazards. You know, to keep things more interesting in the long run. There just isn’t enough replay value at the moment, but I sincerely hope the developers are working on this little dilemma.\n\nIn the end I still think Ziggurat is one of the most fun games I’ve played in a long time and it certainly is one of the most polished ones. I can’t wait for the developers to add even more stuff, because I desperately want to play more of it. And if that’s not a compliment, I don’t know what is.\n\n[Rating: 80/100]","August 15, 2014","true","7.8"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","1"

None of the spells feels as impactful as a double-barrel shotgun though, which is to be expected I guess.\n\nSpeaking of spells, there are a bunch of different ones but those I've encountered so far have been variations on a theme (or rather about 4 or 5). It would've been nice to have randomly generated variants of those items in the style of, for example, Borderlands but the arsenal that's there ultimately is enough.\n\nNitpicks aside, the only thing I didn't like so far is the first person platforming that sometimes is necessary to cross an intersection or get to a treasure chest. The jumping is really floaty and twitchy (which is good for dodging!) and you can't see your feet or any other indicator (like a shadow) of where you'll land and missing the sometimes very small platforms can cost you a good amount of  precious health.\n\nThat's my only real criticism though. This game is pretty great and if you like how Quake/UT/Doom/... control you'll probably like this as well.\n\nSome technical notes: Make sure you increase your FoV from 60 to something like 90 and bind a key to zoom. You can also (re)bind your mouse buttons if you switch to it in the keys menu, the selection box at the top is not for picking either keyboard and mouse or a gamepad.\n\nLinux-wise it runs just fine, but the framerate noticeably drops in some rooms which I wasn't expecting (i5 3570, GTX 660).

Each room that has enemies usually contains more than 1 type of enemy to keep you on your toes.\n\nEach level has a Boss which is usually a larger version of a normal mob on steroids and with special abilities. Bosses are also randomly selected from a  pool of bosses on each level.\n\nYou can start the game with a choice of several characters each with their own strength and weaknesses. Though by default you can only play the Novice. To unlock the other characters you must complete different achievements, such as kill 500 enemies with your Wand, etc.. check the character selection screen for each achievement required to unlock a character.\n\nYou start the game with your trusty Wand and a secondary randomly selected weapon.\nYour secondary weapon could be a type of Spellbook, Staff or Alchemy weapon, each with many available sub-types.\n\nYour main Wand's mana pool regenerates over time while your secondary weapons do not and you must collect mana crystals, dropped by enemies or get perks to refill them.\n\nEach level has a starting room to equip you with your default generated weapons, a portal key room you must find to unlock the boss, a boss room to , well,...kill the boss and move through the portal to the next level.\n\nAmong those rooms you will also find trap rooms, treasure rooms, lore rooms, shrine rooms and of course rooms filled with monsters to fight.\n\nTreasures can be anything from perks, weapons, buffs, or amulets. Amulets have a special skill you can execute with the "E" key by default. Those skills can be anything from stunning your enemies to granting you a temporary buff and more.\n\nThere is also hidden rooms which you expose by breaking down walls which look cracked with a powerful weapon.\nThose rooms contain a perk and some fun-facts about Milkstone Studio's previous endeavors.\n\nAs you progress through the game you level up, each time you level up you can select one of two perks randomly selected from a pool of perks. Perks can heal you, increase health given by health flasks, increase of loot dropped by enemies, increase in health or mana pools and much more. One of the perks even allows you to increase the number of perks to choose from each time you level up.\n\nUpon Death all your levels are lost but your progress might unlock more characters to choose from, more perks to be added to your pool of perks, more amulets and weapon sub-types unlocked, such as an Ice Spellbook, Poison Staff, Rifles, Grenades, etc..\n\nThe guys also added a global Leaderboard to keep you coming back for more to beat the results of your friends or why not attempt to be STEAM's number #1 player :)\n\nThis game is great fun with lots of replay value and in my humble opinion a fantastic blend of rogulelike elements and first person shooter.","November 4, 2014","true","6.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The game is focused on arcade combat, though there are characters, items, and power-ups to unlock, there isn't much RPG-style management, just frantic action.  Highly recommended, and a bargain at twice the price.  Even though it is early access at the time I write this, the current product is of finished quality.\n\nMy only critique would be that the game needs a larger variety of monsters, and maybe a few more room layouts.

It's designed for replayabilty, with levels consisting of randomly arranged rooms, with the weapons, items and abilities found in the levels being randomly allotted.\n\nAs you start the game, you only have a single character to choose from and a rather low selection of items that can appear throughout your playthrough. As you play through the game and reach various milestones, you unlock more characters, weapons, perks and amulets, making future playthroughs more interesting.\n\nYour goal in the game is to travel through the magical Ziggurat, moving room to room fighting monsters. To progress to the next floor, you need to find the key to the boss and then find the boss room, beat the boss and go through the portal. The ultimate goal is to traverse all 5 levels and defeat the final boss.\n\nTo accomplish that you have a wide variety of magical implements, of which you can carry 4, divided in the categories wands, spells, staves and alchemy. The wand is your backup weapon with recharging ammunition (Or mana), while the other weapon types have a great variety of effects and their own respective mana pool. Equivalents for all the expected standard FPS guns can be found as well as many more unique weapons and they all have a secondary fire function, which usually means using more mana to launch a greater amount of projectiles.\n\nI had my doubts before playing, but using these magical weapons is just as satisfying as any shooter with guns, with spectacular graphical effects and good sound design.\n\nIn addition to your gun, you can find and equip an amulet. With one equipped, you can press E to activate some sort of beneficial effect, be it to stun all enemies around you or recharge a percentage of your mana or health. The amulet use is limited by having to kill enemies to recharge it for use again.\n\nThen there's the perks, which you obtain by leveling up. Once you've obtained up enough experience from fallen enemies (In the form of dropped knowledge gems), you can press U and then select one of two randomly drawn perks. Perks can be upgrades of various stats, special abilities or just provide you with a one-use bonus. Some of these are definitely more useful than others and there are times where you have to chose between two bad options.\n\nOnce you've met the requirements to unlock them, you can start a playthrough with different characters, all which have different starting properties, perks or entirely unique abilities, allowing more variety on replays. You also have 3 difficulties (Easy, Normal and Hard) and an "Endless" mode, where the game keeps going and doesn't end with defeating the final boss.\n\nThe game is very graphically pleasing, with a nice cartoony art style and nice colourful effects. The enemy character designs are varied and very charming and it's easy to immediately identify each enemy type and adapt your tactics to match them. Sound design is also very good, with distinct monster sounds, satisfying weapon effects and an atmospheric soundtrack.\n\nA playthrough from beginning to end takes roughly 70 minutes, but you have the option to save once you finish a floor and then continue from the next floor in your next play session. So far, I've made 11 attempts to beat the game and finished it successfully 3 of those times and plan to play it many more times.\n\nSometimes you get a bad run where you face nothing but your most hated enemy with equipment you don't want and perks you don't need, but it's still fun to try to overcome the challenge this presents. If you die, you can always start a new game and hope for better luck this time around.\n\nSo, in summary, I recommend this game for fans of old school shooters that like replayability and aren't frustrated by random factors.","January 29, 2015","true","23.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Also I disliked a lot of the weapons that could spawn at the start, to the point that a few of them prompted me to restart immediately.\n\nThat aside though, the shooting is satisfying and the challenge was fun.

I'll probably pick this one back up again after some time away, when it feels fresh again.","July 4, 2015","true","30.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Voxelated/recommended/308420/","Voxelated","Voxelated","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Voxelated/","241 products in account","This game is a wonderful dungeon crawler that ditches the sword and shield in favor of a wand and robe. Here I will go over the five main features of the game, its story, gameplay, controls, mechanics and graphics.\n\n\n\nSTORY: Like most Roguelikes, the game does not have much of a story to follow. Instead it uses most of its features to provide simple fun gameplay. However, that being said, the concept is a unique idea with a rather in-depth backstory... which makes it unique from most games of this genre.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Yeesh is it fast paced. Most of the game involves you frantically running around rooms that span from claustrophobic to immense size. Most rooms will come with about 10 enemies, however in my two playthroughs I saw rooms with up to 20 and as few as four enemies depending on the size. It's extremely fast paced and really gets your adrenaline flowing when you have low health and no ammo, as the permadeath system is in place.\n\nCONTROLS: Jesus christ is this game fast! I would suggest turning the mouse sensitivity down immediately; turn it to four if you want it to move at a reasonable pace, any lower and you might just be stabbing yourself in the back on more intense battles. Anything above 5.5-6 is headache-inducing. I also turned off motion blur, because it sort of messed with my head, too. However, with everything else in place, the game is a delight to control, just a little speedy with the default settings.\n\nMECHANICS: The whole concept of the game is that you own four different weapons, a wand with infinite ammo, and a spellbook, a staff and a bomb with limited ammo. However, you /can/ pick up more ammo if you find a crystal. You're exploring a large dungeon (can be made endless) called the Ziggurat to keep the evil spirits at bay. The weapons are extremely varied and a bunch of fun to mess around with. My favorite is the bomb, reminds me of a magic grenade. The ammo does get a little sparse around the boss fights to a point where you'll be using the trusty wand to keep the big man at bay. Your health, too, does not recover but rather must be refilled with a special card (you get this at level-up) or potions which the enemies drop. This adds to the tense experience overall and keeps the roguelike feel.\n\nGraphics: Most roguelike games are 2-D, and 8-16bit. Some games are 3-D, but still follow the chunky pixel concept (from experience, Delver [good game, by the way]). However, Ziggurat has a really up-to-date graphics engine. If just a tad cartoony (almost reminds me of an improved TF2 graphics engine) it is appealing to the eye and adds to the overall experience.\n\n\nSUMMARY: Ziggurat is a fun gaming experience that is a great addition to the roguelike genre. I would have a hard time scouting something out that looked as good as this does, considering the audience it caters to. It can run on just about any low-to-mid end PC (I have a midend laptop and this game runs like a charm on the Normal graphics setting. It can run on High, too) which tells me the engine is highly prioritized. Overall, a must-reccomend to a fan of the roguelike genre.\n","November 26, 2014","true","3.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It does a number of things right that were either missing entirely or not fully realized in Heavy Bullets and Fancy Skulls (both of which I think are good, just not quite where I wish they were).\nThe first thing it does right is weaponry. While I have so far only held a handful of weapons I have seen that I currently have around ten unlocked with more on the way. This keeps the playstyle interesting and makes each run more unique. Being gated to hold only one weapon of each type is in my opinion a plus, as it further pushes the survival and "make use of what you have" mentality of roguelikes in general and of Ziggurat in particular.\nThey have also successfully added upgrades to the game, and at a pace which keeps you "wanting just one more". Possibly my biggest gripe with other fps roguelikes,  Ziggurat has made it so your upgrade path affects your gameplay and is something that constantly happens. It's not a diamond in the rough that happens once per game for marginal benefit.\nWhile I only have one other character unlocked, the fact that there are a plethora available all with clear unlock goals is wonderful. All my favorite roguelikes- Dungeons of Dredmor, Binding of Isaac, FTL, Dungeon of the Endless- utilize a similar system, where you can actually start the game with compeltely different gear. This furthers replayability and gives the player various challenges and goals to shoot for.\nOn top of that, so far the enemies are very remiscent of DOOM enemies. By this I mean they are large hulking guys with telegraphed moves. What this means is you learn how to play against each one and feel yourself getting better at handling their individual quirks.\nLastly, the overall aesthetic is pretty stellar. It's somewhat cartoony but in the best way possible, while keeping a serious hexen/doom feeling.\n\nTLDR;  Ziggurat is a stellar entry to the FPS roguelite field. They capitalized on the genre's ability for varying gameplay results by including an array of upgrades, weapons, starting characters, and enemy attack patterns to make the player hone their skill while learning to live with what they have. All wrapped in a neat package with solid art and great controls (on EITHER the controllor or keyboard).

I've never played classic FPS games like Doom, and Duke Nukem, but this feels very similar to them, the only exception is that in this game their are no guns, its replaced with a magic wand,spell books, staves, and bombs. The enemy variety isn't the best but it doesn't matter because you need to learn they're attack patterns and form a stratgey around it. There are many different playable characters that you unlock through completing specific challenges. The weapons are also very different: you can get a fire spell,ice spell,and wind spell. The weapons themselves take some learning to get used to which makes this game a lot of fun because the more you play, the better you get. I'd recommend this game to any person that loves FPS games, or enjoys a game that is very difficult and takes time to learn.

This company went above and beyond and it clearly shows.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a style of game like Killing Floor, for them it's right up their alley. I also recommend it to any other fps fans. It's a very well done, no brainer, stress relieving game.\n\n9/10\n","December 24, 2014","true","18.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The pacing is pretty hectic, but once you clear a room you have time to resituate .  I could easily see this as a retail game.  Also, the game gets updated pretty regularly, with fixes and new content.  Some people might complain that it is short, but they have added an Endless option to difficulty, which I assume means what it says (I have not tried it yet).  This is the best thing I have played in a very long time, and it has plenty of replay value to satify those skeptics who think it might be too short.

These would be games like Unreal Tournament, Painkiller, and the Hexen/Heretic series. I also fully enjoy rogue-likes that have the ability to be replayed without being stale, and don't rely one hundred percent on grinding your way to the top.\n\nZiggurat  is a mixture of all of my favorite points above. There are various characters each with preferred playstyles, boons, and disadvantages. These characters are accompanied by a large variety of weapons that come in three flavors past your pistol-style wand. You have Spells, Staves, and Alchemical Weapons (each eith their own mana pool).  If that isn't enough, theres many different weapons in each category.\n\nThere are minions that you encounter in each room, that with familiarity become less of a challenge once you figure out what works against them. Its when you get into a room vith a myriad of enemies that the fun really begins. waiting for you at the end of each floor is a boss who will put your skills to the test.\n\nAs you make your way through each floor slaying enemies, you pick up experience that, as it always does, levels you up.  Each time you ding, you are given two options that give you various "upgrades".\n\nOverall this game is worth purchasing for the price of 15 bucks, and also has a wonderful developer who is in touch with the community, and updates are still coming.\n\nZiggurat is quite possibly my favorite game in my library.\n\nAnd remember to always check your walls ;)","June 8, 2015","true","32.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game is based around three different pools of magic that power different categories of weapons. Blue mana powers spellbooks like basic fire and ice spells, Green mana powers different staves which shoot smaller, more spread out projectiles, and Orange mana powers heavier weapons like magic grenades. The story is basically you are a magic wielder who must complete the five floors of the "Ziggurat" to test your magic abilities. There are a lot of characters, weapons and perks to unlock throughout the game so becomes more fun the more you play. I felt it getting a bit stale after a while, but then I unlocked new stuff to try out and it was fun again. Only other complaint is that the game doesn't tell you much about it, so a lot of it is trial and error. I feel like the game would be better with more updates, but as it is now it is still really solid. Ziggurat is really fun if you like quick, pick-up-and-play rogue-likes.

Anyway, that’s not the point. The point is this game looked really good from what I saw, a fun and fast paced FPS roguelike. Roguelikes are very common these days so seeing something a little more innovative, such as Ziggurat, is always refreshing. The platforming and 2D level design isn’t here. Ziggurat is a fully fleshed out 3D game that’s has a variety of roguelike elements. Some it does extremely well, whereas others, it doesn’t.\n\nFirst of all, the FPS gameplay in Ziggurat is extremely fun and smooth. It’s extremely fast paced and it works for a game like this. In saying this, the shooter combat isn’t as deep as other FPS games, but this isn’t a downfall for the game, as it is extremely easy to adapt to, especially for the four types of weapons that your character possesses. This isn’t Call of Duty, so don’t expect it. Speaking of the weapon types, there are four for each character. The wand is your base weapon which you start with and it shoots normal damage dealing bolts. The other weapons, ranging from magical to arcane are better than the wand, must be found by the player, and ammo conserved, unlike the wand. This makes Ziggurat a lot more strategic and challenging and gives it that true roguelike feel.\n\nPerhaps the most important element of a roguelike after combat is the levels. Random level design is what makes a roguelike a roguelike. In Ziggurat, the levels are a bit of a disappointment. They are random, but not entirely. The main levels are easily traversable, but they are not like other games such as Rogue Legacy, where the level design was extremely random and couldn’t be played the same way again. Ziggurat is not at all like this. The main levels stay almost identical during the time you spend trying to survive the Ziggurat. The level design makes the player feel like they been there before, and it makes the game feel more repetitive, which is what a good roguelike shouldn’t do. Replaying the game multiple times after death made playing the game much like a chore after a while.\n\nThe enemies in Ziggurat are varied, but not to the extent where there are random enemies each round that you play. Ziggurat has its fair share of enemies to face, and the more you play, the more experience you gain with taking these enemies down more efficiently. Some enemies are tougher than others, thus more thought is required in dealing with their attacks. This is another great aspect of the game as it gives that true roguelike feel of learning enemies and killing them, whilst taking the least amount of damage as possible. Dying is common in the game, but can be prevented, and survival prolonged, if the enemies are understood well. The bosses however are disappointing. They are an identical copy of the enemies, but just bigger and with more health. They are also ridiculously easy to take down if the right weapon is equipped and their attacks learnt. Bosses also spawn enemy minions which make the overall fight harder, but more chaotic, resulting in lower framerate. The framerate issues in the game are easily noticed, especially on low end systems. On higher end GPU’s, performance is excellent, even on the highest settings. But, even when getting 150+ frames, drops are noticeable as 30-40 frames can easily be noticed. This doesn’t detract from the overall experience, but can nag some gamers, especially ones with low end GPU’s. This shows the inconsistency with the game engine as enemies and certain areas are very intensive on frames. In saying this, Ziggurat looks truly gorgeous as a next gen game, and getting high frames whilst observing detailed lighting, shadows and textures, makes it a very immersive experience.\n\nAlthough the game can get very repetitive due to the poor layout of the levels, the perks and the different characters adds incentive to play again. The perks are well designed and impact the game in a considerable way when leveling up, so choosing perks relative to the build of the character, is a vital factor for survival in Ziggurat. Secret rooms, such as trap rooms and treasure rooms, add to the games overall roguelike feel as players can get an advantage or get killed if they are not careful whilst in these rooms. Characters in Ziggurat can be unlocked by fulfilling certain objectives within the game, such as killing X amount of enemies or getting X amount of kills with a weapon. These tasks are rewarding as unlocking characters adds a more strategic feel because every character is different in the way the game is played, or will be played, depending on the player. Some might choose to have more arcane ammunition whilst sacrificing ammo for every other weapon type, whereas others might choose to be weaker at the start but level up quicker to give an advantage late game. This ensures that all types of players can gain mastery with their desired character, making the game appeal to all types of roguelike players. New or veteran.\n\nIn conclusion, Ziggurat is an extremely enjoyable and innovative roguelike game that features a host of different enemies, perks, and characters to experiment with and learn. The level design however isn’t up to par with the other elements of the game, making it ultimately feel stale and repetitive after a while. For the 14.99 asking price tag, is Ziggurat worth it? I would say yes, not absolutely or no way. It won’t suit everyone, but it can be seen that it has developed with the purpose of attracting more gamers to the roguelike genre. Just don’t expect to sink 100 hours into this.\n\n8.2/10\n","July 19, 2015","true","6.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Im not typically a rogue-lite fan, but the spin on putting things in an FPS/wizard setting and the vast variety of weapons/enemies makes it very fun.  Anyone who enjoys rouge lites will like this game, but so will people who enjoy solid FPS style games that require very little commitment but have quite a bit of depth. This game is a prime example of what early access can do for a title in a sea of games that are early access mainly to gain funding, this game did it to help provide feedback and the devs actually listened to the community for once.    That being said, the game isnt without its flaws, some times enemies will clip into the wall, other times ive had saved game problems.\n\nA few things i would love to see in the future:  Online Leaderboards, a small PvP mode and an endless dungeon mode.

Even though it's in early development, it feels like a finished, polished game. There are some things that need a little tweaking (some of the randomized encounters are downright ridiculous, and the Ignus boss summons /way/ more buddies than he needs), but the game is still fantastic. I'm glad to see so many characters available, but lowering the requirements to unlock them (just a little bit) would be nice. The characters have a nice balance to them, at least with the two I've seen. I've unlocked some of the additional weapons too, but I haven't gotten to try them out; maybe increasing the likelihood of unlocked weapons to appear would help?\nAll in all it's a very fun game; it plays nicely, and I haven't run into anything that's just broken or unplayable. No bug problems I've seen either, and even the rare platforming bits (in the lava chambers) aren't annoying. It hasn't gotten tedious or boring yet; and I've been playing for two days now.\nTL;DR: If you're a fan of Doom, you'll like this game. Enemy design is reminiscent of ID's original work, and the visuals are very stunning for an early access game, and just generally good as well. The level of visual detail is incredible, the weapons are varied, and you'll run into new enemy types just often enough to keep your interest.","August 15, 2014","true","28.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The thing is I like this game but I am dissapointed because there is so much more potential! And I hope that with their next game they will think about all this.\n\nWeaponsThe player can carry 4 weapons at the same time. Each slot is reserved for its designated weapon type. In the first weapon slot you carry your standard weapon which is weak but has infinite ammo, so you only use it if you run out of ammo or do not want to waste the ammo of your other weapons.\nEvery weapon has a secondary fire mode, but for 90% of the weapons its very unspectacular. Either the secondary fire mode shoots more projectiles, shoots faster or shoots in a wider cone. That wouldnt be a problem if the primary fire mode of the weapons were more varied, but those also consist mostly of the same patterns. On top of that the 4 weapon types are not that much different from each other depending on the weapons you get. The weapons themselves are not bad though and fun to use, but there is alot of potential wasted here. This also sometimes leads to dull moments when you just hold the shoot button and keep shooting. If the weapons were more different you would have to keep switching back and forth depending on the enemy you fight or your position. On top of that the fact that you never have to reload also adds to those dull moments. I think the game would benefit if they add a very fast reload, even if just so its there.\nYou will mostly use staffs, books and bombs, for your alchemy weapon type you will also have pistols and crossbows but thats it. Here is also not as much variety as the game could have/need, every weapon for the same weapon type is basicaly the same only with different colors and different decoration. Yes, they went for the magician/wizard theme, so there is not THAT much you can do, but then you shouldnt choose this theme. For example they could go for a more Quake-like theme with weapons closer to real world weapons but which look like medieval creations, but I dont know maybe there is more you could do with the wizard theme.\nOne last negative about the weapons is that the value of each weapon type is the same except your starting weapon which you will never use again anyway after the first 2 floors. For example the 4th weapon type could be more exotic weapons like rocket launchers or something (speaking in general) which would be more powerful, but have more rare ammo. This would create another layer of decisions the player would need to do like do I use my weaker weapon but save ammo for the big weapon for later but risk loosing a lot of health, or do I just use my big gun but risk getting into trouble later? On top of that they could reward the player for exploration with ammo for these exotic weapons.\nAlso the game would be much more fun if you could have more than 4 weapons, 6-8 is a good number in my opinion, but ok lets dont get crazy the devs had "problems" already with 4 weapon types.\nA very good example for this is Serious Sam which has lots of very different weapons, every weapon has different value, different strength and weaknesses and so on. If they would encourage switching weapons during the fight depending on many factors it would break the dull shooting, but currently you just switch if you get bored of the weapon or run out of ammo, rarely its because the new situation demands a different weapon type.\n\nBUT: The weapons are still good, still fun to use and the shooting is not always dull. There is just SO much potential here wasted unfortunately which could make this a fantastic game.\n\nDancing with EnemiesThe term "Dancing with Enemies" comes from the creators of Serious Sam. In Serious Sam you not just have to shoot enemies, you always have to dodge their attacks, different attacks. It gets interesting when you get attacked by a big variety of enemies, some ranged some melee.\nZiggurat also has this "Dancing with Enemies" thing, but its not as interesting as in Serious Sam. The problem is that like 90% of the enmies are basicly the same projectile shooting static things. Maybe one does explosive shots, one homing shots and so on and so forth, but for the player thats not a difference. The way you have to dodge these different types of projectiles is the same, they just do damage in a different way or one is easier to dodge than the other. Funny thing is even the melee enemies are basicly just projectiles, because they just run at you and then attack. I think there is only one enemy which is different and that is a chicken-like thing which runs at but then JUMPS at you, when you dodge he could be behind you so now you have to worry about your front and your back.\nOkay there are also other enemies like wizards which can spawn mobs or enemies which spawn minions when they die and stuff like that, but there is a lot of potential again here wasted. And again you should look at Serious Sam 3 for enemy design. The boss battles are fine, but could also be better. All you have to do is keep shooting and dodging, as always. There is one boss which is the plant thing which you can only damage when it opens its mouth. That creates a nice dynamic, because in between you can focus on its minions. This type of boss design should be used for all bosses.\nThis game plays more like a bullet hell shoot em up (the 2D top down space ships shooting things) and not like an FPS, I mean thats not a bad thing, its fun.\n\nUnlockablesLike every rouge-lite you will play multiple playthroughs because of perma-death and because you unlock tons of things like new characters, weapons and upgrades. I think its okay to have just 1 character at first (its good actually), especially because you unlock new characters really fast. Unfortunately the characters are not THAT different to each other, but they still encourage you to try everyone out. However for better character design the devs should look at "Risk of Rain", where every character is basicly a completely different game (it doesnt have to be as crazy as in Risk of Rain). But because of this unlocking new characters is cool, but not as rewarding as it could be.\nWhat is really bad in my opinion is the extremely low amount of stuff you have at the start. When you level up you will ALWAYS see the same upgrades, half of them obviously worse than the rest. That makes level up not really fun. The weird thing is that even now where I unlocked many more upgrades I still see the same ones a lot, but okay thats maybe just unlucky. The upgrade system is cool, but the upgrades dont change as much as they could. Most of them are just "you have more hp", "you have more ammo for weapon type X", "you run faster". Again I think you could look at "Risk of Rain" and The Binding of Isaac for more rewarding upgrades, for example give the player an effect which makes enemies explode on death and damage other enemies. Or make the player randomly shoot extra projectiles with each shot, or make the shots of the player penetrate enemies. There are TONS of things you could do. BUT I can understand that its harder to do that for a FPS than for a 2D shooter, especially considering how crazy full and silly the combat in Risk of Rain gets at the last levels. The current upgrades are not fun enough though.\nBut I like that you unlock stuff really fast and lots of things at the same time and overall its still motivating to unlock things.\n\nOverall I still really like this game, I am just dissapointed by the amount of potential wasted. Okay sorry "wasted" sounds a bit unfair, I just try to make my point. But I am really eager to see what these developers will do with their next game.","June 14, 2015","true","9.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Not a bad thing.  However, the game can become very repetitive at times as you trudge your way through the same five levels over and over again.  While the level layouts and the enemies are different every time, the environments and the music stay the same through every run.  But enough of that nonsense, on to the review!\n\nGameplay:  The gameplay and the controls of this game are incredibly solid.  Turning and aiming can feel very loose at first, but these settings can be changed in the options menu (and I strongly recommend turning down the default sensitivity unless you like spinning around and trying to aim until you throw up).  Other than that small starting fluke, cannot fault the gameplay at all.  Basically the player is a sorcerer-in-training that is sent to take the ultimate test!  Cue the Ziggurat!  A five floor dungeon filled with everything from giant, poison spitting mushrooms to carrots that want to tear your eyes out (along with particularly angry flamingos).\n\nThe enemies are part of what make this game great in the fact that there is a massive variety of them, especially for an indie game.  Every enemy is unique, and must be handled in a particular fashion which makes the combat very diverse and interesting.  Granted a majority of the fighting is strafing and shooting, but then the world of spells, staves, and alchemical weapons comes into play and there is no shortage of uniqueness when it comes to these either.  Whether you find the mighty Skull of Xanatos that homes in on enemies and explodes on impact, or the ever-awesome Eye of Twilight that can eradicate bosses in a single strung out volley of green power, you are unlikely to become bored while finding and trying new weapons.  Add in some big boss baddies, and you have yourself a fantastic RNG-based dungeon crawler that won't get repetitive until the 20th or 30th time you defeat the last boss (who's mother is a ♥♥♥♥♥).\n\nUnfortunately the one minor complaint about this game is the RNG factor.  Yes, I understand it is a roguelike game so it sounds like I'm just QQ'ing, but hear me out.  The RNG factor when it comes to weapons works very well in a game like Binding of Isaac, because there is one manner of attack that can get upgraded or changed in a variety of manners.  In Ziggurat however, the player starts with a rather useless wand (on most characters) and finds different spells, staves, or alchemical weapons to dish out the real damage throughout the dungeon.  However, it is completely RNG based on what weapons will appear.  It is possible (and has happened) that in a single run, the poor wannabe sorcerer will obtain 4 alchemical weapons in a row, therefore robbing them of unique opportunities that present themselves in different rooms, and quite possibly destroying the run altogether because they were never given a spell or a staff.\n\nGraphics:  The visuals in this game are top notch.  Smooth movement, no screen tearing, bright colorful environments for the most part, and incredible enemy design make this game a feast for the eyes.  Especially in a world where 2D pixel graphics have become the mainstay in a majority of roguelike indie games.  Only complaint here is that the floors are very, very similar looking when it comes to the environment.  This can get very repetitive if you decide that you love this game and want to play it a lot.  Was hoping for maybe some alternative environment designs to be thrown into the mix, but like the song goes, you can't always get what you want.\n\nSound:  When it comes to the sound effects, this game is pretty incredible.  Everything from firing the spells, to the enemies exploding, to the lava flowing under the bridge is, for lack of a better word, awesome.  Only complaint here is the music, but I'm a big music critic when it comes to games.  The music is pretty generic and forgettable, and you'll often find yourself turning it off and listening to your own music (at least I certainly did).\n\nReplayability:  Ziggurat really shines when it comes to replayability.  Tons of unlocks.  Perks, spells, staves, alchemical weapons, and a plethora of characters that are all somehow very unique.  Throw in a bunch of achievements and you'll end up dropping a lot of hours into this one.\n\nTLDR: Game is definitely worth your time and money.  Great gameplay, unique weapons, characters, and enemies, make this game a must-buy.  Oh and did I mention the developer is very active in the forums?  Replies to just about everybody in a very friendly, helpful manner and is STILL updating the game with new stuff every few months.  Much respect for professionalism and dedication.

However, with some additional content this may become a classic. This has a very "Binding of Isaac meets Heretic" feel to it. The gameplay is just plain fun, and battling enemies is challenging. The graphics look nice, reminiscent perhaps of Orcs Must Die?? - simple yet gorgeous, not lacking at all. The only downside to this title is I feel that entering rooms with only enemies is sometimes a punishment, and can turn an awesome fight into feeling like a grind. I don't feel as excited as i should to explore. The devs are focusing on adding variety and bug fixes so this may not even be a concern for long.\n\nBottom line is the game is already fun. I love what I see and I want more of it. More spells, more weapons, more rooms, and more enemies. Early access development will determine if this game remains "fun for a while" or a permanently installed staple in my library.","August 14, 2014","true","11.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

That final test is the Ziggurat, a massive magic “dungeon” you must pass or die trying.\n\nFirst thing I’d like to share is that this game looks fantastic. There is so much color in this game! The style is quite different, I can’t quite put my finger on it but, it reminds me of Fable for some reason. All the environments, the lighting, spells and weapons you use have wonderful affects and the overall look of the game is amazing, I really love the graphics here in this game, it makes me wish there were more to see or an adventure to go on in this world. Usually I like to also include music with the overall style but here the music is average, it isn’t bad, just standard.\n\nThe rogue-like elements in this game are the usual random rooms, weapons, enemies, loot, bosses and so forth. In fact the different types of rooms and the way they work reminds me a lot of the Binding of Isaac, some rooms will have you take a gamble in spending life or mana for potential gain or loss. Some will have treasure chest at the end of an Indiana Jones type room filled with either traps or a jumping puzzle in a room of lava. There is good variety here so traversing the Ziggurat shouldn’t feel too derivative.\n\nThere is a lot to unlock in this game, however, you can actually beat the final boss in just an hour or two, the dungeons are pretty short so be expecting to go through multiple ziggurat runs to unlock everything. A sort of missed opportunity is having the final boss be something different or, adding more levels of the ziggurat every time you play through it so that each play through feels very different and to give more of a sense of progression.\n\nThe games story is all frontloaded at the beginning cinematic and at the end of the Ziggurat, the game is entirely based on its combat. The combat is very reminiscent of games like the Unreal Tournament series or Quake Arena. The game relies on you to be fast and dodge all incoming projectiles, the more skillful you are in this the more successful you will be at the game. Weapons also lend to reminding me of Unreal Tournament, with all the weapons in the game having a main firing mode and an alternative firing mode, all this combined makes the combat feels very fast paced and chaotic, and pure fun.\n\nI really enjoyed myself with Ziggurat, its an amazing game for only $14.99 USD. I hope this isn’t Milkstone Studios last game, I’d like to see Ziggurat get the Diablo 2 treatment, same world, similar style but completely cranked up, keeping the combat and adding in more role-playing elements and maybe a world to explore. I don’t say this often, this game is also great for kids, it isn’t overly easy or hard, its got great challenge, not super intense or gory, it’s just a solid gaming experience for all.\n\nTL/DR; Ziggurat is a solid first person rogue-like shooter, you play a wizard with bombs, spells, magic staffs and your trusty wand. Pass the trial of the Ziggurat or die trying. With beautiful graphics and good old fashioned, fast action combat you can’t go wrong dropping $14.99USD for this wonderful indie. I look forward to more games from Milkstone Studios.\n\n-Thumbs up from Royial\n\nVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/RoyialNetwork","April 13, 2015","true","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This isn't nessecarily a con- Just a design choice, I suppose. The gameplay itself is very on par with those games- Bunnyhopping, zig zagging between shots, twitch reflexes, the like.  The relatively simplistic level design helps to set the breakneck pace of the game, which is definitely steeped in "holy ♥♥♥♥ wizards" type action. On the whole, this is a very enjoyable and tense game- I like the angle of "Wizards and Monsters" that is used, rather than some variety of sci-fi tripe that is becoming increasingly trite in the FPS genre.","October 28, 2014","true","13.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay basics are those of an old school FPS, while the general game design is closer to "rogue-lites".\n\nAs an apprentice, you are to take the trial of the Ziggurat, a trial designed to let only the most promising wizards succeed. Others will die, as simple as that. Those who survive will join the ranks of a powerful order of wizards.\n\nYou enter the Ziggurat, which is basicaly a multi-layered, procedurally generated dungeon. Each level starts in a room in which you get a weapon. Almost each room is filled with thrash mobs (minions) that you have to kill to get to the portal key, which allows you to summon this level's boss (guardian). Mobs drop XP (knowledge gems), life vials and mana gems. The XP allows you to chose a new perk each time you level up.\n\nDeath is permanent, so if you fail you'll have to start all over again, but the more mobs you kill, the more new items and perks will be added to the list available in your next playthrough. By completing objectives, you'll also unlock new characters to play, all of them with strengths and weaknesses.\n\nGameplay is fast. Rooms are locked until you kill all the mobs inside so you have to kite and use available cover. There is really an old-school feel to it with a modern touch. Nostalgics of Doom, Quake and Hexen will definitely feel at home, while players used to modern FPSs might think it's a little too stripped down to the basics.\n\nZiggurat is a solid game that goes straight to the point. It is very enjoyable and offers the potential for long hours of fun and punishment while allowing for short-ish play sessions. Definitely worth its price.","May 7, 2015","true","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's been on my watchlist for quite a while, mainly because it has a Hexen/Heretic artstyle in it.

The levels have a dark fantasy gothic feel and the rooms range from large spacious fields to confined spaces.\n\nSo far playing the game has been really fun, replayability really keeps me coming back to play more of it. There is actually quite a lot of characters to unlock through playing the game and new items to discover. However, if you're looking for a deep story, you better look elsewhere. Most of the story you get is short cutscenes and short diary entries found in levels. The rest is just fun, randomised, arcade-like shooter action with tons of enemies out to get you.\n\nThe things that I really want to see in the future is multiplayer mode and more varied environments. Maybe something like that will happen in Ziggurat 2?\n\nOverall if you're looking for a game that plays and feels like modern era roguelike Heretic, this is a game for you.

I like the progression of unlocking more things the more you play, which inheritnly makes each playthrough different, in addition to the randomly generated rooms.","June 23, 2015","true","9.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A nice variety of characters to play as, although you have to unlock them, that play differently. A nice amount of enemies and bosses, it will take you several play throughs to see all the bosses. Enemies are varied, with some leading shots to peg you if you stay going on the same path while others will shoot randomly or melee.\n\nThere is a wide and interesting variety of weapons. All unlocked weapons or perks are given at the end of a run, seemingly at random. Only characters have specific ways to unlock as far as I can tell. All the weapons initially unlocked are good, some of the ones you can unlock are almost OP... and some of the ones you unlock if they show up on the starting floor as my free weapon I'll just restart because I can't stand using them. Those are mostly the ones that create temporary hazards, which CAN harm you. Admittedly some of the explosive weapons can hurt you also, but that is only if you are too close to explosion, they do not leave DoT spots on the ground you have to watch out for.\n\nThere are a ton of perks in this game, most are very useful, some less so. You get to pick between 2 every level up and can find them rarely in bonus rooms. Some of the more annoying perks got reworked some with today's patch to make them more useful.\n\nAs Totalbiscuit said in his "WTF is..." video "Easy" is normal, "Normal" is hard, and "Hard" is masochistic. Difficulty as far as I can tell only really effects enemy damage output, so if you know the game well you should be fine. There is also an endless mode where instead of 5 floors the game just keeps going.\n\nRooms are randomly chosen, but from a limited set of rooms. You will eventually see them all. That being said they are all nicely detailed, can have random effects, or be a hazard/bonus room. Enemies do not appear in hazard rooms, probably because the damage from most of the hazards can kill you insanely quickly and they'd be impossible to avoid while strafing/backing up.\n\nOverall a fantastic game, which is still getting minor additions/bugfixes to make it better. I can not wait to see what else they add to it.","February 13, 2015","true","85.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Marufrozen/recommended/308420/","Marufrozen","Milan Mree Frozen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Marufrozen/","452 products in account","I can definitely recommend this game, but I'm going to be honest about everything I say and this game is not amazing in any aspect at all. It feels like the game is missing the key component of variety.\n\nAllow me to explain.\n\nFirst and foremost all the levels in the game have barely any variety in graphical design. Sure there is fire spewed from cracks on one level and water on another, but they kind of blend together when there is no cohesiveness. For example you might have a lava room right next to a water room. Not just that but you don't get anything like you do with say binding of isaac where you have the basement and then the caves. It doesn't work like that. There is no jungle followed by castle it's all the same and it really hurts the game aesthetically. With that said the game is not ugly. It's fairly stylized and for what it is it's quite nice to look at. The spell effects are nice and it's very colorful contrasting the greys of the concrete wonderfully.\n\nThe next thing to note is pretty similar to the previous, but based in the basics of controls and gameplay. So controls works and they work well. You move somewhat fast and you can jump easily and things work. But they don't work very flavorfully. Dashing is done in literally one direction and there is barely any in between speeds. No crouching, no bouncing off walls, no climbing, no double jumps as far as I can tell, no crawling, no swimming, no variances of any kind. As soon as you get the movement down you get it and you undestand it and that's that. There will be very little to learn extra. It's not bad at all because it 'works' for sure. It just isn't great.\n\nAlright lets move onto the combat, weapons, spells, etc. Combat is another form of 'it works' and just so. Enemies are stricken by attacks and they flash to let you know you hit them. They get hit by your attacks and take damage and then die.\n\nWith that said I want to say that enemies really don't do much else in terms of you fighting them. You engage, you attack and then they die or you die. There is poison and slowing for the enemies, but there isn't anything like enemy weaknesses or anything like that. Enemies don't really flinch they just keep goin. Combat works, but its not very satisfying. With all that said combat works as in it functions very well. I do have some complaints like when I can't hit a skeleton with a shield from behind with a bomb because you have to hit them when they lift it up. I also don't like that the game feels like a first person bullet hell especially when some of the rooms are uncomfortably small and hit detection on some melee attacks is terrible and it's impossible to avoid some of them.\n\nOk lets talk about the spells you use. They're pretty neat initially. The wand shoots some pew pew purple blasts. It can alt fire for a shotgun style blast too which is pretty nice and it recharges. It's kind of a backup weapon though considering the power of the other weapons. And while the pew pew is nice, it gets old especially when most weapons just fire projectiles. And there's no variety with different characters they are just very mildly different mostly. one is good with the wand, another is better with the mana based weaponry that has limited ammo and one is faster. Not a lot of variety.\n\nLike, so you can get a staff and the staff shoots projectiles just like the wand, but it fans them out. Having a weapon like this is nice to have, but there's more than one staff that functions this way. They just have small differences like one poisons, one slows, one shoots fast, etc. Same with the bombs, one explodes, one explodes into poison shards, one leaves fire. Not to mention some of the weapons are OP as ♥♥♥♥ compared to others poison bombs OP. The variety in functionality though leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nTo explain what I mean I'm going to compare to some other games so bear with me. In hexen you have three characters you can play with. The mage, the cleric, the fighter. They are vastly different for numerous reasons. The fighter has fists where he goes 'Punch, punch, POW' while the cleric has a mace that just swings and does damage and the mage has a staff that shoots a little weaker laser pew pew. That's their starting weapons. They are very different from each other and as you play through, they have red, blue, green mana weapons and the weapons they all get looks and function differently. For example, the blue weapon for the fighter is a lightning axe that blasts targets in melee with lightning. It can even be used when it's out of charge for less damage. The blue weapon for a cleric is a staff that can shoot bolts of energy or it can suck the enemy's life at close range. The blue weapon for the mage is frost hands that does a big shotgun effect at range or freezes opponents at close range and then they can be shattered to bits.\n\nIt's not like this in ziggurat. most weapons have a primary fire that does something in that school and and alt fire and just does that thing more for more mana and that's it. Examples like spells in the blue mana category that do a shotgun effect. There are like 3 to 4 of these and their alt fires just do a larger AOE of them. The freezing one can freeze enemies for a second, but it doesn't do much else. It's not really very satisfying at all. Then there's staves that just shoot a buncha projectiles like a fan and more projectiles with alt fire. There is like the eagle staff which is heat seeking, but it hardly matters as it's alt fire is just more projectiles! And alchemy? It's explosives pretty much. Bombs and a rocket gun, etc. Alt fire? You guessed! It's just more projectiles!\n\nAnd this kinda blandness is all over the game. The perks you can get are really meh. Like ooooo more hp, big deal. In a game like binding of isaac getting extra HP is rarely the first thing you care about. That's more like something you are happy to get, but not super excited over. People like brimstone, monstros lung, ipecac and other unique and enjoyable modifiers. Stuff like that does not exist in the game. You dont' get something that makes your projectiles multiply. There is no 'your staves becomes laser beams' or 'your bombs stick to enemies' or 'when you get hit you belch explosive vomit'. Nothing that makes the game really stand out.\n\nOne last thing to note and it's the secrets in the game. it's kinda annoying that when you find a secret you're treated to the devs showing you other games. I don't get this. Why is it done? You don't reference your old games directly. Why do this at all? I dont' care about your others games and if I did I would google your company name. If you wanna reference an old game you do it subtly.\n\nAlright so it may sound like I hate the game or dislike it, but that's not true at all. I do like it, but I just want you to know what you're getting yourself into. The game isn't bad, but it isn't great. It seems to me like the devs landed on gold and then proceded to dig far away from the gold mine possibly due to lack of experience, knowledge of good game design or even just being lazy. Maybe it's all those crappy microsoft avatar games they made beforehand that ruddied up their creativity. Regardless of why the game isn't better, it's not bad and I got it for five bucks and I'm pretty satisfied with it. I'll probably still play it, but it will always leave me wondering what could be.","January 1","true","29.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Interesting and colorful environments and enemies, varied room goals, and wonderful weapons/weapon abilities.  There are a bunch of unlockable characters to choose from, as well as a host of unlockable items and bonuses.  Ziggurat is fun, challenging and rewarding all at once.\n\nWhile the amount of character-related content is staggering, the world itself is a bit... vanilla.  Opportunities that could have been used to add lore to the game are instead spent introducing you to the dev's previous projects.  Those rooms are particularly annoying because they force you to view the (thankfully brief) dialogue.  There are a few types of secret rooms, but they typically contain a single item and nothing else of interest.  If you're looking for dialogue and story content, look elsewhere.\n\nA solid shooter, well designed and well taken care of.  Skip Paranautical, skip Heavy Bullets.  The voxel based entries in to this category can not hold a candle to the nuts and bolts of Ziggurat.\n\nThis is the one to buy, although I do wish the devs would throw out another update or two to finish things up.\n\nEdit (6/3/2016) - As soon as they wrapped the console port, the dev team swung back and added a new game mode (Gauntlet), and a boatload of bugfixes.  Likely the last update, barring balance/bugs with Gauntlet, which is not a disappointment in the least.  After a stint in Early Access, and two years of support beyond release, Milkstone have made Ziggurat the best possible game it could be.\n\nNot only are these guys a shining example of Early Access done right, they are also a great tutorial for ANY developer on how to take community feedback, and how to improve your game even beyond the release window.\n\nNow let's start talking about a sequel, Milkstone. ;)","September 6, 2015","true","19.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For those worried about replayability, do not fret! There is random generation for pretty much everything you encounter in the game.\n\nThere's at least 30 different weapons, plenty of perks and monster types to keep things fresh for a long while. Of course there is a bit of overlap between them, for example two bombs, one which simply explodes and the other which leaves behind flames on the ground but they are mechanically different so it feels different enough.\n\nThe game's difficulty is definitely tuned towards more experienced FPS players. Health is scarce, do not expect plenty of health packs/regenerating health to save you. Also, the bosses pose somewhat of a threat so be prepared before waltzing into a boss encounter! However, the easy difficulty is very well tuned for those who may find themselves stuck after floor 2 in normal/hard (like myself, the scrublord).\n\nOverall, I am pleased with my purchase of the game and I look forward  to seeing the updates in the future.","October 26, 2014","true","2.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I love the fact that almost every time you play the game you feel yourself physically improving even if it's over a short ammount of time. No run is like the other with it's constantly generating dungion. Fight through 5 floors of various monsters, each unique in it's own way. Many monsters are color changed and size swapped to show that they have special attributes to them.\n\nThe game has 4 weapon types as well as a large array of starter characters for you to choose from, rivaling that character roster from binding of issac. The 5 floors you adventure through grow more and more difficult, switching themes the farther you go down. The Ziggurat,(The tower you are challenging to become a Master mage) Is a very difficult task indeed. You can hold up to 4 weapons, of various kinds of magics. Starting with the Wand(Starter weapon for each mage, can't be swapped out) Staves, Spellbooks and Alchemy. Each of the magics all have their own ups and downs. There is a secret room on each level you adventure through, depicted as a crack in the wall. Each room contains a perk, and a little tidbit of information about the portrait hanging on the back wall, which depicts another game that Milkstone has developed.\n\nSome Cons, I would point out that some of the bosses look like the minions they spawn during boss encounters, especailly the lost spirit boss.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/weakest/recommended/308420/","weakest","dood.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/weakest/","76 products in account","A great polished game for its price, highly recommended for those who enjoy other rogue-lites such as Binding of Isaac.\n\nMore specifically, it is a fast-paced FPS rogue-lite with combat similar to Hexen/Heretic (1990's FPS dark fantasy games). For those worried about replayability, do not fret! There is random generation for pretty much everything you encounter in the game.\n\nThere's at least 30 different weapons, plenty of perks and monster types to keep things fresh for a long while. Of course there is a bit of overlap between them, for example two bombs, one which simply explodes and the other which leaves behind flames on the ground but they are mechanically different so it feels different enough.\n\nThe game's difficulty is definitely tuned towards more experienced FPS players. Health is scarce, do not expect plenty of health packs/regenerating health to save you. Also, the bosses pose somewhat of a threat so be prepared before waltzing into a boss encounter! However, the easy difficulty is very well tuned for those who may find themselves stuck after floor 2 in normal/hard (like myself, the scrublord).\n\nOverall, I am pleased with my purchase of the game and I look forward  to seeing the updates in the future.","October 26, 2014","true","2.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I have yet to encounter a glitch or even a clipping error. Also, the graphics as well as the effects - graphic as well as soundwise - are great. Controls are smooth and the options menu offers everything a gamer needs.\n\nThe game itself is kinda like an FPS-wizardy-roguelike-mashup. You have to play it to know what it feels like.

Worth picking up every now and then but isn't something you could sink a lot if time into during a full play through, lending it's self to the One or Two rounds to pass the time.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCPLC7_TdSM\n\nI think I might just drop some names here...\n\nHexen, Doom, Serious Sam and The Binding of Issac.\n\nThat's right, I did say Binding of Issac.\n\nMade by MilkStone Studios, the team behind Little Racers, show off what they really can do\nwith some simple gameplay mechanics.\n\nThe Story, even though not really needed, sets the mood very well on what to expect.\n\nYou are a member of a brotherhood of wizard apprentices, attending a ceremony that\nhappens once every 10 years. The final test of an apprentice to become a Daedolon Brother,\nthe most powerful and sacred achievement for any arcane mage.\n\nThe Ziggurat has opened. Giving birth to these little carrot ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!\n\nAs it was told by the elders, failing is a fate worse than death, an almost offering\nto the evil souls within to keep them at bay, and...\n\n*Ahem*\n\nThe Ziggurat changes with each visitor, rooms shifting and changing because of dark magic\neither filled with Traps or the Minions of Hell, puzzles and traps, or cleansing of\nthe rooms are to be performed before moving on....\n\nThe rooms themselves range from open to labarynth like, not just a standard size square\nroom, some are very wide, extremely long or filled with SERIOUSLY, WHAT THE HELL IS THIS MEANT TO BE? A DAMNED CARROT?\n\nIn each floor of the Ziggurat, there is a tablet called a Portal Key. When found and\ntaken to the Boss Room, it will summon the random boss of that floor. Upon defeating\nthe boss, off to the next floor of the Ziggurat.\n\nItems and weapons come in the magical variety, coming from 4 different classes of magic,\ndepicted by coloured vials.\n\nArcane Magic is shown only when utilising the soul wand. Acting almost like the "Pistol"\nof the group of items, it recharges over time without needing to pickup magic\nto restock it.\n\nBlue Spell Mana, learned from books or a crossbow, are the spread fire or Ice spells.\nDamaging or freezing enemies in place for a limited time.\n\nGreen Staff Mana is like your machine gun ammo, staffs are very powerful but use a\nlot of Mana to keep the damage up.\n\nand Alchemy, The Orange Mana Bar, reprisenting the cross over of Magics and Machinery,\nwith Shotguns, Rifles and Bombs, explosive based damage with a punch!\n\nThere are also unique trinkets that can be found in trap rooms inside the treasure chests\nat the end of the room, providing extra benefits when needed, like extra damage or speed\nboosts.\n\nBy collecting the yellow crystals, you can level up and select a perk each level, with\nthe usual more health, damage and resource usage modifiers.\n\nAnd with each death, more abilities, perks, items and trinkets are unlocked for the next\nrun. Others unlock when certain conditions have been met.\n\nThe Enemies come in Fantasy Varieties from bird like hoppers, skeletons, liches, mushrooms, flying... sea creatures of some sort that shoots lightning, haunted pieces of armor, lost souls and.. Mushrooms.\n\nEach with their own attacks and abilities, there's also unique enemy types that have\na coloured aura around them, where they are either faster, higer damage or have more\nhealth, just for a ...

You play a student of a secret society of mages going into the proving grounds known as The Ziggurat. Succeed and you will stand with them as the guardians of humanity. Fail and...well, just don't fail. It would be bad.\n\nAll the hallmarks of roguelikes are here. Random dungeon generation, random item placement, random enemy encounters, random bosses...You get the idea. You can find cards that increase your stats or give you passive abilities, you also are allowed to pick one of two of these cards every time you level up. A bizarre cadre of weapons and amulets can be found and these items are unlocked based on how well you did each run. Characters with alternate starting abilities can also be unlocked by reaching certain milestones.\n\nBeing a roguelike, this game is hard. SUPER HARD! Even on easy the game is very challenging and some bosses are a real pain in the ♥♥♥. (I'm looking at you, Lady Audrey...)\n\nThe game does have a sense of humor and there's plenty of references to 90s shooters like Doom and Rise of the Triad placed through out the game. As well as other references too. I won't spoil any of them. XD\n\nIf you're willing to mitigate the frustration factor of it being very difficult, then this game is can be a lot of fun. It's a great throwback shooter with roguelike elements that can be quite addicting. It's probably not for everyone, but check it out for yourself and see.\n\nIf you're a roguelike junkie, like myself.

To do so he or she must brave their way through the dungeon of Ziggurat which very few return from alive. Upon entering we start off with our trusty wand and a random weapon generated by the dungeon. One of the first things you will likely notice is just how tiny our character is. He is supposed to be a regular human but in game it feels like he is like a foot tall and it does take a while to get used to your view coming from so low on the ground. What he lacks in size he makes up for in speed as your character is very agile and can move at break neck speeds, even without sprinting. It comes in handy as the gameplay here is old school in the sense that you can dodge your enemies’ projectiles as you keep on the move instead of hiding behind cover. Your enemies are typically wacky things like evil carrots, mushrooms and slimes which gives it a light hearted tone, though the threat they pose is very real.\n\nEvery time you start a new game the dungeon's rooms and floors changes meaning no two playthroughs will be the same. The rooms can range from treasure rooms where opening the chest can lead to either fortune or misfortune, a wave of enemies or a trap filled room that sometimes contain treasure at the end. There is not much variety and you will quickly begin to see the same rooms being repeated after a few playthroughs.  Most of the rooms will pit you against a wave of the dungeon's monsters and you will be locked in until you dispose of every single one of them. The gameplay is fast paced and tons of fun featuring three mana pools for each elemental weapon type. Weapons that require mana are far more powerful than your basic wand though they will quickly burn through all that your reserves and acquiring more mana comes down to pure luck from your enemy drops. It is better to use it only when you are in a pinch or save it for the bosses. Your go-to weapon will be the purple wand that you start off with that can be infinitely used but does require some time to recharge after consecutive rounds. The wand differs slightly from character to character but more often than not you will be spending more time waiting for it to recharge so you can actually fight again. It is most likely to balance the gameplay but with how little damage it does you do get the feeling they went a little overboard with the recharge rate.\n\nEvery weapon has an alt fire which are usually a simple shoot more projectiles at once type of ordeal. It comes in real handy with dealing with large crowds and gives more options for your combat style. With how frequent you will be in combat they try to mix it up a little by randomly throwing a modifier in some rooms such as giant enemies or making a certain mana type cost less to use while raising the cost of all the others. They don't really add much to be honest, giant or tiny enemies have as much health as normal and more often than not you are given very annoying modifier such as only being allowed to move while jumping. It is an attempt to spice up the gameplay but feels more like an unwanted nuisance than anything else. A modifier that I particularly loathe is one that summons a couple of obelisks that take an annoying amount of damage to destroy while enemies infinitely respawn around you until you do so. The things like small mana pools, waiting for your basic weapon to recharge after a bit of usage and annoying modifiers do make the game more difficult but at the cost of fun and the flow of the action. It is a ton of fun avoiding homing projectiles, shooting area of effect spells into a crowd of enemies and then flinging a tornado spell at a line of enemies so it is disappointing your arsenal feels very limited due to mana.\n\nThere is a way to increase your mana pools when leveling up. After collecting enough yellows gems from defeated enemies you will level up and be able to choose from one of two cards that can have a variety of effects like regenerating health from breaking objects, increased damage when your health is low or the aforementioned increased mana storage for one of the three elements. The problem with that is you have two cards from a large selection of perks and three mana slots making the chances of being able to increase the mana pool for the weapon type you have very slim. You are given a new weapon for each floor you complete though the selection when you start the game is lackluster. More are unlocked the more you play the game though it can get a bit boring playing the game over and over again with nearly identical weapons the first few hours of the game. Eventually you will have poison grenades, freezing spells and a spell that flings a spectral skull that seeks out its targets to name a few. Ziggurat has very fun and interesting gadgets at its disposal making it a shame that you start with very little. It is likely designed this way in an attempt to keep you playing since you unlock more stuff every playthrough but it ended up doing the exact opposite of that since the excitement of discovery wanes very quickly due to it.\n\nTo complete a floor you will have to face the boss but before you do so you'll need a portal key to summon it. You must explore the floor's rooms to find it which can lead to some pretty interesting situations in where you find both very quickly and must decide if you should risk clearing out some rooms in order to level up a bit. Bosses are just giant versions of regular enemies disappointingly enough but you will soon forget about that since their way of fighting is a lot different and far more vicious.  It is quite exciting to be running away from a giant goblin as it smashes the pillars you were hiding behind a few seconds ago while you desperately rain down spells and try to avoid his goons. A large part of why bosses are difficult is because they have a mob of infinitely respawning enemies so you must focus fire on it alone unless you want to dry up your mana supply quickly. What boss you will face is randomly generated which is a nice way to keep you on your toes since you have no idea what you are about to summon.  The enemy AI is decent enough but there is no real enemy placement, you just walk into a room and they magically keep teleporting in around you until the game decides you have killed enough to pass.\n\nThe environments are nothing special and are mostly just a bunch of gray rooms with the occasional lava. What really gives this game its own unique flair is the colorful lighting. There are plenty of different colored crystals growing out of the ground and let out a soft glow that really adds to the sense of being in a magical and mysterious environment. Both your spells and the enemies’ projectiles are colorful as well making the once gray room suddenly turn into a very deadly rave club. Music is decent too, nothing special but it does its job well and keeps you invested in what is happening on screen. Story is nothing to write home about, it is there but it's nothing memorable. Some lore is also added into the game via scrolls that you may randomly find in a room that talk about the contents of the dungeon and the wizard's order. Once you've killed enough of a certain enemy you will unlock it in the bestiary menu and be able to view its character model without the fear of it ripping your face off. All in all Ziggurat is a game with many flaws that keep it from being great. It is shallow and gets boring fast due to not having much variety in the randomly placed rooms, small amount of items that can spawn when you start the game and modifiers not being fun or interesting in the slightest. Despite all that it is still a decent game with the type of fast paced FPS combat not seen very much these days and a good choice when you are low on time and want some quick, evil carrot slaying fun.","February 23","true","8.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","1"

Unfortunately this game has both in spades. I enter a room and I'm greeted by a horde of guys with swords mindlessly running after me, so I sprint away, fire a few shots and repeat this tens of times until they're all dead. This isn't my idea of fun, it's a chore. The big, flying guys are a chore because they also take ages to kill. The stone golems that break into smaller ones are a chore. The carrots are a chose because they're about as fast as the player and will chase you down until you turn around a land a few shots.\n\nSo with all this running around, you tend to forget the other enemies with ranged attacks that can attack safely, knowing that the player has their hands full sprinting from one end to the other, trying to avoid a ball of melee death. This way you tend to forget about the ranged enemies and then you run into their projectiles. I could use a different weapon, but eventually the ammunition runs out and I'm back where I started. I really want to like Ziggurat but playing it isn't exciting, tense or fun.

It is not uncommon to spend more than a couple minutes in the larger rooms taking potshots with an empty wand becauase somebody thought it was a good idea to give bonus health modifiers to already spongy enemies. In addition, Resurrection Obelisks tend to come in packs of 3 or 4, each with more health than most enemies, and until they're gone you will be stuck with infinite enemies. Elder Gods help you if you get stuck with 4 Obelisks AND super spongy enemies in the same room, because that's 5 minutes of your life wasted.\n\nPoor Hitboxes: Were you excited about being able to jump in this game? Well TOO BAD, because the jumping exists only for the forced jumping "puzzles." Making any attempt to jump over anything else in this game will get you killed. Projectiles from slimes have hitboxes that appear to extend to twice their height, meaning jumping off a staircase over a slime is a great way to get ruined. More egregiously, pools of acid that some reptilian enemies have will cause lots of damage if you make an attempt to jump over them. Apparetnly our hero has no issue jumping 2 inches above bubbly lava, but can barely survive jumping 2 feet above bubbly acid.\n\nUnsynchronized Animations: The greatest example of this problem is with the carrot enemies. You will take damage from them, THEN the bite animation will happen. This is absolutely stupid because these enemies can come in droves, and making any attempt to run past them or jump over them will only get you hurt.\n\nI understand that the Random aspect of the game is integral to some players enjoyment, but I figured I'd share some of the random garbage I've gotten dealt in the few hours I've played.\n- Large Square room filled with invisible enemies, that consisted of nothing but floating skulls. (That one took me 10 minutes because one kept getting stuck on a pillar where I couldn't see it).\n- A Super Speed Champion Melee Enemy in a room where I had my movement slowed.\n- Exploding Enemies in a room with nothing but carrots.\n- 4 Resurrection Obelisks on a run where the only drops offered were a Frostbow, a Porcupine Grenade, and a Viper Fangs. (Another 10 minutes of running in circles taking potshots)\n- A room with the 4x damage for all modifier where multiple Banshee enemies shot me through the thick fog and instantly killed me.","February 3, 2015","false","12.5"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","14","26","0","2"

How about Quake/Doom (the old ones)? This is kind a mix of both. You're a wizard shooting with you wand at whatever moves. You gain experience and level up, but if you die, start again! The game is not long but, as the rooms are randomized every new game, it has great replayabilty. Besides, the progression system is kind of aleatory. You can choose between two or three perks each time you lvl up, but these perks are random. I had hard time to finish it on easy, but each time you die, you receive new perks/weapons possibilities and new characters to choose (changes the fighting voices, the main wand and the strength/weakness)\n\nAnd the best part: it doesn't relies on gore visuals. This was a great "feature" for me. I don't like gore, and usually these kind of games shows lots of blood. It's a matter of what you like, but for me, that was a big plus.","February 1, 2015","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I purchased this game to relieve the itch for a new BoI-like experience. Remember that this review is from my perspective; you have been warned!\n\nZiggurat is a game that utilizes elements from rogue-likes and first-person arcade shooters. Just think of BoI transmuted into Doom. You play as an apprentice wizard, determined to initiate towards a prestigeous rank. In order to do this, you must complete the daunting trial, known as Ziggurat.\n\nPros:\n+Intriguing setting with additional lore\n+Detailed, yet light-hearted graphics\n+Enemies with unique mechanics\n+A note-worthy amount of unlockables\n\nCons:\n-Bland character progression\n-Anticlimatic weapons (pea-shooting)\n-Underwhelming floor strategy\n-A few punishing design choices/mechanics\n\nPros:\nAlthough the story is not the main focus of the game, it is clear that a lot of thinking was put into it. I was most impressed by the "lore rooms" which contain collectable scrolls that reveal more about the world. Furthermore, the graphics set the game's tone very well with their atmospheric, fantasy style. In the first few playthroughs, there were moments where I had to stop and just look at the vibrant environment.\n\nAnother high-point in the game is it's enemies. In order to effectively fight them, you must learn their movement patterns and determine which weapons are most appropriate for the situation. While I would have enjoyed seeing more enemies, the ones that I did see are full of character. Some manage to be both menacing and comical.\n\nFinally, as a BoI fan, I love the amount of unlockables that can potentially change future playthroughs. This includes weapons, upgrades, and even playable characters. Achievement hunters can easily spend more than 10-12 hours in this game.\n\n\nCons:\nWith all that said, Ziggurat is not without its flaws.\nThe most prominent flaw is the disappointing character progression. The mechanics of becoming stronger are fine. You are given a new weapon (spell, staff, alchemy) at the begginning of each floor, and to level up you must defeat enemies and pick up the experience that they drop. Upon leveling up, you get to choose between 2 upgrades/perks. There are also other ways to become stronger including treasure rooms with traps, shrine rooms, and other secrets. The problem lies within the upgrades themselves. Many of them miss that X-factor that's supposed to make leveling up an exciting experience. While obtaining items in BoI could significantly change the behavior of your character, leveling up in Ziggurat usually means increasing your health/mana pool, getting an upgrade with painful side-effects, or even getting non-permanent upgrades. To be fair, I haven't unlocked every upgrade yet, but its been 4 hours in-game and I still feel empty when I level up.\n\nSomething else that disappoints me is how most of the the weapons "feel" in Ziggurat. Many great games benefited by emphasizing a character's punch or the kick-back from thier gun. This climax should give the player a feeling that these actions are significant. The only weapon that made me feel this way in Ziggurat was a throwing weapon, the alchemy grenade.\n\nMoving back to game mechanics, I also found that there is very little strategy to each floor. Try to level up as much as you can before fighting the boss, choose to fight the boss if you get a temporary upgrade, avoid breaking objects in the world until you need health or mana, etc. There are not many decisions to be made other than when you encounter a shrine room, which allows you to get a random upgrade (or downgrade) at the cost of health, mana, or nothing.\n\nFinally, there are a couple of design choices that, to me, seem poor or harsh. For instance, if you are not quick enough to pick up experience it will disappear. This forces you to make the painful option of either losing health trying to pick up the experience, or losing the experience itself. Something else you will encounter are treasure rooms with traps. Most of these require awkward, first-person platforming which is managable on a game-pad, but rather difficult with keyboard and mouse. This will likely result in death the first few times, but mastering these will come early with practice.\n\n\nConclusion:\nWhile I am disappointed by the character progression in Ziggurat, I am recomending it because I can see myself putting in a decent amount of hours into it. With that said, this is definitely not going to replace my love for BoI. Before purchasing it, I suggest that you read more reviews and watch "let's play" videos of it.","January 23, 2015","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ziggurat provides the user with a seemingly obvious but not often tried idea, waging war through the eyes of a mage/wizard/sorcerer. There are a large variety of unique and distinct enemies, an interesting arsenal that caters to different play styles or situations, and a charming but at the same time dark and daunting environment. The gameplay is very reminiscent of old shooters such as Quake and DOOM without being too derivative and provides a fresh new take with its procedurally generated levels.","January 23, 2015","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's fun, challenging and looks pretty great. A successful run takes around an hour or so, not too long, not too short (although that's just my personal taste).\nBoss fights are pretty challenging, even if i havent encountered too many different bosses.\nYou start with one unlocked Character and by fulfilling certain criteria (like killing 200 Carrots, Beating the game once, etc.) you'll unlock new characters with different starting abilities and new items.\n\nHowever, my biggest disappointment with the game is the lack of powerful upgrades/items. Theres a decent amount of Level-Ups you'll get in a run, each level-up giving you a choice of one of two Upgrades. At the start of every Floor (5 in total) you get a new kind of Spell (there are 3 kinds of "spells", Alchemy (basically bombs), Staves and Spells). Sometimes you'll stumble across Amulets that are activatable items with a recharge timer. Now, it might be because I haven't unlocked a ton of stuff, but I've found myself getting the same upgrades again and again.\nComing from Paranautical Activity and other rogue-lites (like Binding of Isaac) I was used to the mechanic of Item Rooms/Shops on every floor and an upgrade after every Boss. I kinda missed that in Ziggurat and in turn I'm missing some of the replay value of say BoI, where every run can turn out completely different. But that's just my personal preference.\n\nIn case you care about a Rogue-lite's story: Ziggurat's story is fairly simple but pretty cool and interesting (I really liked the cutscenes, the artstyle is just lovely):\nYou're a Wizard Apprentice taking part in a Test to become part of the most powerful group of Wizards, but I thought the ending was pretty disappointing if I'm honest.\n\ntl;dr: Lovely art-style\ngood gameplay\ncool bossfights\nlarge amount of unlockables\nI, personally, am missing the replay value, but I'm sure I'll do a run every once in a while.\nWouldn't pick it up fullprice, but at a 33%-50% discount it's definitely worth the money :)","November 11, 2014","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I fully believe that Milkstone Studios have created a game which will go down as a classic,  is difficult without being frustrating, and has set a benchmark for its genre for the foreseeable future.

It's in early access since august 14 and boy have they been at work. Already 7 updates and some of them are pretty big ! The game is awesome, it kinda reminds me of some medieval shooters like Hexen (as the mage class of course) but more action oriented. So in short it's a FPS rogue-lite in a medieval fantasy world, where you unlock more and more stuff (a bit the way you do in Binding of Isaacs) with unlockable classes (they're unlocked by completing objectives) that are specialized and play differently.\n\nThe gameplay itself, unlike some others said, is great. Some balancing needs to be done to some monsters (mostly Demons and Salamander) but still it plays a lot like Doom-like shooters. Lots of projectiles to avoid, and trying not be in the center of a crowd of enemies to keep yourself alive.\n\nSame goes about diversity ! I do not agree with negative reviews. There are already 3 different zones  with their own themes (room patterns are common to all themes apparently, which I think is good, this allows a good environmental diversity), there are already a lot of monsters (boldoks which are some kind of goblins, some kind of flying badass whale, projectile firing armor and flying counterpart, evil funghus, golems, demons, cockatrices, salamander, most of them with bosses counterparts). Oh and I forgot about something, you actually get to kill... carrots ! Yeah you read it right, evil long teethed carrots ! How badass is that.\n\nYou also get to unlock some new weapons. All weapons are separated into 4 slots, the 3 thirds for magic (wand, spell and staff which are pretty much pistol/shotgun/machine gun for the default weapons) and the last for alchemy (fire/explosion specialized slot).\n\nAnd guess what, they plant to release mid Q4 this year, so they will enhance it a lot. And they clearly state :\n"Anyway, we plan to keep adding more content to the game on a regular basis once the game is finally released.”\n\nSo, do I recommend this game? Yes totally.

If this were a simple exercise in level clearing with save games like its forefathers it would be quite dull and repetitive. The inclusion of rogue-like permadeath along with procedural generation makes every game exciting, and never the same experience twice.\n\nDo not buy this game if you demand the following in a game: realistic physics, shooters with cover systems, complex plots with branching morality choices that result in different endings, or a game where you, the gamer, always win no matter how much you suck.\n\nDo buy this game if you like you like: fun, a challenge, fun, circle strafing, and more fun.

If you are even thinking of buying this game and worried about Early Access, stop worrying and pull out your wallet. If you liked Paranautical Activity or Tower of Guns even a little bit, buy this now. I'm a huge fan of both, but this game take takes this Rogue-like(light for you crazies) FPS genre, and just executes it flawlessy.\n\nThe developers of this game also have the best contact with the gamers that I've EVER seen. Even a thread to show you what they've done or are working on each day. Very professional in that manner.\n\nSince I've bought the game (only about 3 days ago), there's already been some pretty massive (and awesome) changes. I simply have been unable to put this game down. The complexity of it, the skill required, and of course the beautiful chances of having an absolutely overpowered mind-blowingly fun run. Need a reason to buy? The large character selection, the (hopefully) ever expanding amount of enemies, the constant mayhem, and all the other beautiful things they've done so far makes this an instant buy for any FPS/Quake/RogueLike fan out there. Lastly, at the current stage of this game, it's far from easy. If you're looking for a casual game, you likely will NOT enjoy this game. Pretty solid difficulty overall.

How about Quake/Doom (the old ones)? This is kind a mix of both. You're a wizard shooting with you wand at whatever moves. You gain experience and level up, but if you die, start again! The game is not long but, as the rooms are randomized every new game, it has great replayabilty. Besides, the progression system is kind of aleatory. You can choose between two or three perks each time you lvl up, but these perks are random. I had hard time to finish it on easy, but each time you die, you receive new perks/weapons possibilities and new characters to choose (changes the fighting voices, the main wand and the strength/weakness)\n\nAnd the best part: it doesn't relies on gore visuals.

It's fun, challenging and looks pretty great. A successful run takes around an hour or so, not too long, not too short (although that's just my personal taste).\nBoss fights are pretty challenging, even if i havent encountered too many different bosses.\nYou start with one unlocked Character and by fulfilling certain criteria (like killing 200 Carrots, Beating the game once, etc.) you'll unlock new characters with different starting abilities and new items.\n\nHowever, my biggest disappointment with the game is the lack of powerful upgrades/items. Theres a decent amount of Level-Ups you'll get in a run, each level-up giving you a choice of one of two Upgrades. At the start of every Floor (5 in total) you get a new kind of Spell (there are 3 kinds of "spells", Alchemy (basically bombs), Staves and Spells). Sometimes you'll stumble across Amulets that are activatable items with a recharge timer. Now, it might be because I haven't unlocked a ton of stuff, but I've found myself getting the same upgrades again and again.\nComing from Paranautical Activity and other rogue-lites (like Binding of Isaac) I was used to the mechanic of Item Rooms/Shops on every floor and an upgrade after every Boss. I kinda missed that in Ziggurat and in turn I'm missing some of the replay value of say BoI, where every run can turn out completely different. But that's just my personal preference.\n\nIn case you care about a Rogue-lite's story: Ziggurat's story is fairly simple but pretty cool and interesting (I really liked the cutscenes, the artstyle is just lovely):\nYou're a Wizard Apprentice taking part in a Test to become part of the most powerful group of Wizards, but I thought the ending was pretty disappointing if I'm honest.\n\ntl;dr: Lovely art-style\ngood gameplay\ncool bossfights\nlarge amount of unlockables\nI, personally, am missing the replay value, but I'm sure I'll do a run every once in a while.\nWouldn't pick it up fullprice, but at a 33%-50% discount it's definitely worth the money :)","November 11, 2014","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With the game out of Early Release, I can absolutely say that it is still one of my best purchases I have made, and I still highly recommend this game.  It still continues to be updated with new content, and there is at least twice the amount of content than there was in my original review!  I absolutely continue to recommend this game, and just might be buying a copy or two for my friends while it's on sale!\n\n---\n\nI'm a HUGE fan of old school games.  I'm also a HUGE fan of Roguelikes.  So of course this game was an instant buy.\n\nI'm usually careful about buying Early Access games, but I have to say I am not disappointed in the least on this one.  It gives the feeling of playing older FPS games like Doom/Quake/Heretic, but also adds the mechanics of Roguelikes, so that way each time you play, you get different randomly generated levels that makes it a new game every time.\n\nYou can unlock new characters and collectable perks as you play; each character have their own strengths/weaknesses, and the perks you unlock come in the form of cards that you can earn upon level up, or even find within the dungeon.  You can also unlock new weapons to find in the dungeon as well, each under one of three categories: spells, staff, or alchemic weapons.  You also have your standard wand (your starting weapon) which, albeit weak, has infinite energy.  Each weapon has its own mana pool (basically like unique ammo types for each weapon), which can be refilled by picking up mana crystals (except for the wand, which must regenerate on its own).\n\nI've seen people complain about how the game "does not have much content".  Okay, yeah, the weapon selection could be bigger, there could be more floors, more enemies, etc.  But this is an Early Access game, so it's still in progress!  Not to mention that it's had 9 updates so far, each one just about a few days apart!  The devs are really on top of their game and are consistently fixing bugs and adding new content.  You don't see that often!  And besides, FPS games back in the early 90s that this game was based off of had only about eight weapons, and only a handful of enemies, and their levels weren't always generated like in this game.  So I already consider this to have a satisfying amount of content for what it is.\n\nMy little brother and I have logged a lot of hours on this game (my little brother plays it much more though, but plays it in Offline Mode), and we still enjoy playing it often.  And yes, this would be the sort of game to introduce younger gamers to the FPS genre, without disturbing them with blood or anything else that might bother parents.  And besides, what child wouldn't enjoy zapping their wand or staff at evil carrots?\n\nYes, you heard me right.  One of the enemies are evil carrots that run after you.  If that doesn't make you want to buy this game, I don't know what will.\n\nVery good graphics, wonderful gameplay, great replayability.  Sure the game may seem short with only a few floors to travel through in each game, and you may get frustrated because you were one room away from the boss but yet got stuck trying to destroy some obelisks while deadly minions continue to spawn and kill you, but you'll find yourself struggling to resist starting yet another game afterward.\n\nWhether you like roguelikes or not, this is a game any FPS fan should try.","September 12, 2014","true","45.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not Ziggurat! But if you were to point out that it uses random enviroment generation, ammunition resource management, a perk/item system like what The Binding of Isaac does, it would raise its hands and start trying to get as many words out of its mouth against that argument. It depends on how closely you adhere to the Berlin Interpretation of what a Roguelike is.\n\nBut what Ziggurat is banking on is its FPS gameplay. And I think it does it about 75% well - the gameplay reminded me of classic Serious Sam/Painkiller action, which is pretty damn great for a game made in nine months. The level design sucks like a hoover, though. I am not a fan of randomly generated level layouts for FPS games - they're an alright substitution if you can't sit down and create ten levels by hand, but immersion is my main complaint here. It's not too bad of a flaw, because while I can identify the type of level, the battle largely depends on the type of monsters. A little more variety definitely wouldn't hurt here, though!\n\nI feel the same way about the bosses. "Hey, mage bro! You sure killed all the monsters in the other nine rooms of this dungeon! Now shoot the bigger monster surrounded by the other monsters and you can go to the next level!" Again, this is fine, but I am getting restless and bored just because the biggest monsters want more punishment before they go down.\n\nIt's not a bad game, but it's left me a little wanting. I can't blame the developers for that, they made this damn thing with a four-man team in nine months. What I am surprised by is how solid it is and how well it's managed to scratch that old-school FPS itch.

A lot of the gorgeous environments feel like they go to waste because you kill the minions (which honestly doesn't require running around a lot of the arena) and then... well... there's nothing. Some rooms have treasure chests, some have other things, but these giant arenas just feel like they need something to do once the monsters die. Some of them are laid out perfectly for deathmatch play which is really frustrating to see because you always think "man I wish I could fight my friends in here".\n\nThe multiplayer aspect is definitely a huge missed opportunity, but it seems to be a big theme in the reviews, maybe the devs will listen eventually.\n\nAside from that the game is beautiful, the art is crisp and it feels like if Torchlight was a FPS.

If this were a simple exercise in level clearing with save games like its forefathers it would be quite dull and repetitive. The inclusion of rogue-like permadeath along with procedural generation makes every game exciting, and never the same experience twice.\n\nDo not buy this game if you demand the following in a game: realistic physics, shooters with cover systems, complex plots with branching morality choices that result in different endings, or a game where you, the gamer, always win no matter how much you suck.\n\nDo buy this game if you like you like: fun, a challenge, fun, circle strafing, and more fun.

It is a very fun and tough rogue-like kind of like Paranautical Activity but with magic and even some gun looking weapons.  It will make you very frustrated but also very satisfied when you make it through rooms that seem virtually impossible.  You may die many times but every type of weapon is effective in every room so using your supplies wisely can help lead you to victory or at least allow you to survive longer.

It's in early access since august 14 and boy have they been at work. Already 7 updates and some of them are pretty big ! The game is awesome, it kinda reminds me of some medieval shooters like Hexen (as the mage class of course) but more action oriented. So in short it's a FPS rogue-lite in a medieval fantasy world, where you unlock more and more stuff (a bit the way you do in Binding of Isaacs) with unlockable classes (they're unlocked by completing objectives) that are specialized and play differently.\n\nThe gameplay itself, unlike some others said, is great. Some balancing needs to be done to some monsters (mostly Demons and Salamander) but still it plays a lot like Doom-like shooters. Lots of projectiles to avoid, and trying not be in the center of a crowd of enemies to keep yourself alive.\n\nSame goes about diversity ! I do not agree with negative reviews. There are already 3 different zones  with their own themes (room patterns are common to all themes apparently, which I think is good, this allows a good environmental diversity), there are already a lot of monsters (boldoks which are some kind of goblins, some kind of flying badass whale, projectile firing armor and flying counterpart, evil funghus, golems, demons, cockatrices, salamander, most of them with bosses counterparts). Oh and I forgot about something, you actually get to kill... carrots ! Yeah you read it right, evil long teethed carrots ! How badass is that.\n\nYou also get to unlock some new weapons. All weapons are separated into 4 slots, the 3 thirds for magic (wand, spell and staff which are pretty much pistol/shotgun/machine gun for the default weapons) and the last for alchemy (fire/explosion specialized slot).\n\nAnd guess what, they plant to release mid Q4 this year, so they will enhance it a lot. And they clearly state :\n"Anyway, we plan to keep adding more content to the game on a regular basis once the game is finally released.”\n\nSo, do I recommend this game? Yes totally. It is worth it in its current state, and it does look like the devs care about their baby and will actually keep their promises (until now, they do). If you like the idea of medieval-fantasy Doom-like rogue-lite experience, then don't hesitate a second :)","September 7, 2014","true","18.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is an highly competent FPS, with good room design and enemies variety. It's fun and stylish if you like this aesthetic. I have  only one criticism, and this may be only for those who have a lot of experience with these kind of games. Like many game in this genre, when you lose or win the game, you unlock new skills or items that go into the random pool of upgrade(new options for skills when you level up or new weapons). The problem I have with Zuggurat is that for your first playthrough, the pool of items and skills is extremely limited. I beat the game on my second run, and during this run, I keep running into the same boring skills and weaponry. The game does not tell you how to unlock more of these skills and weapons, so you just keep playing until the pool gets big. After 10 hours, the game is a LOT more fun than in the beginning. Even so,  I really had to push myself to keep playing after my second run, since the only real objective i had from this point on was not to see the end credit, but unlock more items or characters. Their seems to only be one ending, but I am not sure, i only got to the end you two differents characters. I recommend playing on hard, or just play more casually so that you keep unlocking at a healty rate so that you dont get bored.","January 1, 2015","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love trying to get all the new charecters and find new weapons and all that stuff. My only complaint about the game is I feel like it's too easy. I was expecting something like Dungeons of Dreadmor or Dungeon of the Endless, but it is not that at all. Be warned, this game is not very difficult, it starts out a little tricky but once you have the ropes you'll be able to blow right through it. I beat it in under six hours, and I've been plaing just a little more to try and unlock all of the acheivments, but that's pretty dull. Anyway, if you think that the price of this game is worth 5-7 hours of gameplay then go right ahead. I know that it can be longer if you bother to unlock everything, but honestly once you've beaten it it's a lot more boring with no central goal.","June 16, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

This is a game that really emphasises how fast you can run around each arena. It is possible (and critical) to dodge nearly every enemy projectile. The weapon variety is decent. In each run of the game you are given random weapons at the beginning of each floor. My only complaint in terms of weapons is the fact that the alternate fire for most is simply "fire more projectiles." A missed opportunity.\n\nAs a rogue-lite, the game feels like a much simplified Binding of Isaac. Rooms are procedurally generated. Trap rooms show up here and there. Weapon drops are random. On levelling up, you must pick between two random perks from a decent pool (though one perk gives you the option to pick between three). At the end of each floor you face a boss.\n\nAll things considered, the game is great.","June 26, 2015","true","34.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You've played this game. (joking)... In all seriousness, Ziggurat is heavily inspired by The Binding of Issac, and that is not a bad thing. Not at all. It is a rogue-like (not sure why some other reviews think it isn't..), rooms and content are randomly generated, progress does not carry over between deaths, random perks in some rooms that can be good or bad.  Don't listen to anyone who says it is not a rogue-like game. That being said, is it a  good 	 rogue-like? I think so.\n\nThe game starts off pretty difficult, and it stays that way.  Depending on who you are, that could be a good or a bad thing.  If you like challenging games, play this.  If not, then stay far far away.  You will be killed over and over again in this, but every time you die you unlock new items, classes, characters and perks that will make the next time around easier.  I absolutely love this style of gameplay.  It is purely skill-based. You never know what is coming or what spells/perks you are going to get.  You have to play with what you get, which forces one to master each aspect of the game.\n\nThere  is	 a story, but, like Dark Souls, much of it is hidden in the world. It is nothing special, nor does the game need it, but it is nice to have.\n\nThe gameplay is very solid. It takes a bit of getting used to but I really like it. There are four different types of attack, and variations on each of the four.  They each serve a purpose and it does one well to learn each.  Exploration is greatly rewarded, and highly encouraged. The leveling system works fine, though it could probably be improved a bit as the random generated perks you choose between at each level-up I found to be very similar.  There is a good variation of enemies, though you will likely learn how to fight each one pretty quickly.  The game sounds amazing.  Each and every sound effect is great, the score is tense and it just fits.  Props to the sound team.  Ziggurat is surprisingly demanding on high settings, but most PC's should be able to play it just fine with a bit of fiddling around in the settings. (Though keep in mind, there isn't a whole lot to change). The randomly-generated rooms are well designed and very creative, but you will end up seeing most of them on your first few attempts at the dungeon.\n\nOne of my only gripes with the game however, is that on the later floors (there are five), the game seems to favor throwing hordes of enemies at you rather than coming up with difficult, skill-based enemies to fight.  It does help that the game will begin to mix the different kinds together in order to spice things up, but it would have been cool to have certain challenging enemies that only show up on later floors.\n\nOverall, this game is a lot of fun. It is very unique, and has a lot of potential if the devs plan on adding content at some point in the future. (I feel a multiplayer horde mode would be pretty cool...)  If you like games such as Rogue Legacy, The Binding of Issac, Spelunky, and so on, you will love this game. If you haven't played those (please play them), it would still do you good to try this one out.\n\nI highly recommend this game.\n\nHere is a video of my first few minutes in the game.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=470435362\n\nNOTE: It might just be my computer, but I experienced quite a few bugs (NONE of which were game-breaking) while playing such as sound cutting out or attacks not landing, but if waiting a few minutes didn't fix it, a quick restart always did.","June 27, 2015","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Plays kinda like painkiller where the action is almost the entirety of the game, but has quite a fair amount of random factors involved too.\n\nWhile great skill will get you far, if your luck is poor, skill wont get you far enough. Which is fine, it gives the game a challenge every playthrough as well as keep itself fresh.  Unlock weapons, abilities, and characters to get you motivated to keep playing, and after you have unlocked them all, you should be comfortable enough in the gameplay to try beating the game with each character, all of which have perks and drawbacks, and some of which have special endings.\n\nThe game doesn't really feel like it is missing anything, it doesnt ask to be anything else.

There is still a good bit of work to be done. I would add a difficulty option that makes health drop more common. Enemy types should be more varried and I would add more. Please add more unlocks, they carry the urge to keep playing. Achievements/challenges would add more goals to take away the pain of death and increase the urge to keep playing. Since we are calling this a Rogue-like, I would add loads of random staffs/items. Some armor drops would be nice too. These things would add more variety to the game. The key goal needs to be adding replay value. The core game is a very fun twitch/"rogue-like-like" as it stands. Quests or goals and more items would make it so much better. Character art (while good) does not match the game. It looks like WoW's orc areas.

I also wish there was some sort of multiplayer.\nI went in wanting to get a game like Heretic or HeXen but I honestly didn't expect to get one.\nI'm so glad I found this game, as I've ran through the Ziggurat successfully 4 different times and I am still addicted to this game.","December 31, 2015","true","27.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is also very intense - I noticed I was dodging attacks in my chair, and holding my breath at the end of some of the later level's battles. Because it's a roguelike, it'll reward returning to it again (and I will, just like Tower of Guns), but I made it through the five levels of the main game and finished off the final boss (barely). The levels are beautiful, the monsters are ugly, and it's challenging but fair. I'm really glad I picked it up; it's definitely worth a try if you liked games like Hexen and Heretic way back when and want something with a similar feel. My only negative is that it doesn't have enough secrets in it, but that's not much of a complaint.","January 26, 2015","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really admire that the developers have stuck with their game and I think it shows a real passion for their ideas and craft. Bravo for that. The game was a bit lacking in replayability when I first purchased it and the free updates have been good for it.\n\nThis is a great game if you just want to dive a dungeon and blast monsters to appease your digital blood god. The music and story are almost non-existent, so this game does stand more or less on its shooting and dodging gameplay alone. The good news is that the gameplay is very fun, so as long as you aren't expecting a story you will probably enjoy this game. I purchased it for $11 on sale and I am very satisfied with it.\n\nIf I had to suggest one thing that would improve this game, it might be more stage layouts with more diverse texture sets. The floor layouts and scenery can get dull as you play the game more.","October 13, 2015","true","30.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has beautiful graphics, especially for an indie game, and is extremely well optimized. The game itself is a lot of fun, and a large part of the game hinges on choices the player makes. Choices to go to all of the rooms in the dungeon, or which perks to select, or what wand to use. Each choice plays a vital role in your survival. In true dungeon crawling fashion, you must explore the map, collect items that power you up, and fight a boss at the end of each dungeon to move forwards. I, by the time of this review, will have logged roughly 15 hours on the game. This is an average Dollar To Hour Ratio, about 1 dollar an hour to play the game. It is definitely worth the full price, and it is extremely fun to zip around the map, with unique wands and weapons, fighting flying imps, splitting rock monsters, and even crazy carrots. The game is challenging, so don’t expect to beat it on your first try. The lore is rich, and is shrouded in mystery. With luck by your side, I hope you can leave the Ziggurat alive.","September 12, 2015","true","18.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is kind of similar to tower of guns except with more mobile enemies that sometimes swarm you like in serious sam. Your weaponry includes a weak starter wand, various shotgun like spells, wide spread and rapid fire staves, and alchemy items that are typically explosives or arrow types. Every attack you use draws from one of four pools of mana (wand/spell/staff/alchemy) and proper management of your stocks is crucial to surviving each level.\n\nMovement is very slick and you will probably find yourself sprinting a lot since the game lets you ice skate around at high speeds making it easy to get across levels and to avoid monster attacks.

To add to the difficulty, all items in the game will despawn after a set period of time (including the experience gems which you need to level up!) so not only do you have to take down everything in a room but you also have to dance in between monsters and grab up all the mana gems, health, and experience before it disappears. This can be annoying at some times but it does add to the overall challenge and prevents the player from simply sniping at things until everything is dead.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game to anyone who likes old-school style hectic single player FPS play since it gives off that kind of vibe with the cramped rooms and monster spawns.","July 27, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a game that really emphasises how fast you can run around each arena. It is possible (and critical) to dodge nearly every enemy projectile. The weapon variety is decent. In each run of the game you are given random weapons at the beginning of each floor. My only complaint in terms of weapons is the fact that the alternate fire for most is simply "fire more projectiles." A missed opportunity.\n\nAs a rogue-lite, the game feels like a much simplified Binding of Isaac. Rooms are procedurally generated. Trap rooms show up here and there. Weapon drops are random. On levelling up, you must pick between two random perks from a decent pool (though one perk gives you the option to pick between three). At the end of each floor you face a boss.\n\nAll things considered, the game is great.","June 26, 2015","true","34.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The ground and objects have massive sized hitboxes so that you can't shoot over things without aiming a whole foot over the object you might be hiding behind; this means you have to put yourself out further into the fray in order to hit some things.\n\nThe aimbotting enemies (I know they are NPCs, so aimbotting is how they do it) have a ridiculous aim.  I can avoid almost all the smaller melee based monsters with extreme ease, but the ranged based monsters are almost too good; especially when you are in a room with a lot of them.  The spawn system compounds that further by making them appear where you don't anticipate being attacked from.  Bottom line for me, is that this makes any of my deaths feel cheap.  That so many ranged monsters can get little nicks off me without any effort.\n\nThen I was placed into a room full of the big armored guys that like to throw bombs.  Except these guy flew and their bombs left behind a fiery residue that i couldn't walk through without taking damage.\nI think this is a cool idea; but the residue takes forever to dissipate, and the enemy has already launched 2 or 3 more by the time it has.  When in a room with just 2 of them means I can barely get an opportunity to attack them without running through fire.  This actually happens most often while running backwards away from their shots.\n\nOh right. I almost forgot about the monster spawn system!\nThey literally spawn anywhere in the room, after they've spawned in the room.  So, in games like this it is very important to have awareness of everything that can hurt you right?  I thought so.\nBut, I don't know if i mentioned that this game feels cheap yet, but this game likes to throw newly spawned monsters after you've killed the first set. It isn't like, you killed the first wave so here is wave two; more like, you kill one monster and a new one spawns.\nSo I'm not against things like the hydra affect, where you kill a monster and two more take its spot.  That is visual, you can see that two monsters took the spot of the guy you just killed; more challenging, makes you have to think about the order in which you kill things so you don't overwhelm yourself.\nThis game does do a little bit of that, but mainly it is just random spawns at random locations.  Right behind you for all the game cares.  Just a really cheap mechanic designed to get your hurt more often than you should.\n\nPLATFORMING!!!!  WHY OH WHY!\nThis game starts to feel like it would belong more comfortably in an arcade. Where the challenge is designed to be high in order to get you to pay for more continues.  The platforming in this game just compounds on that idea.  I can handle the monsters all day just about; but when I get put into a platforming room i risk losing half my health or more due to the movement mechanics and lack of true awareness for where my feet are.\nLet me just quickly mention that I think the movement feels pretty good- when fighting monsters and trying to dodge attacks; but platforming?  It kind of starts to feel like I'm gambling away a third of my life savings on a slot machine for only a couple meager items.\n\nAgain, bottom line for me is that the game has potential; but it just feels cheap as it is and I really feel like it would fit better in an arcade somewhere than on my laptop.\n\nI don't want to talk about the monster designs too much, as i'm not sure I've seen them all yet.","May 21, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have heard it compared more then once to the Raven Software classics, Heretic and Hexen and this comparison is apt: Not just due to Its fantasy setting and wizarding weapons, including spellbooks, staves (with one, the Serpent Staff, borrowed from Hexen directly) and alchemical conconctions, but also in its fast, frenetic gameplay, with traps, jumping puzzles, large, projectile-spewing bosses, and for all you Unreal Tournament fans out there, mutators that mix up the battles. The game is very forgiving on its easiest difficulty, affording you a tour of the experience to prepare you for the challenges ahead. I've only just completed my first run, though there seems to be many more items, characters and weapons to find. If you're looking for a test of skill with no doubt a good amount of replayability, you could do worse then to put on your robe and wizard hat, and face the procedurally-generated halls of the Ziggurat.\n\nEDIT: Many runs later, Ziggurat remains a fresh and invigorating experience, and now with the addition of a wave-based "Gauntlet" mode, can be enjoyed in bitesize form.","June 2, 2015","true","39.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat is fast and frantic, all the weapons feel great (I'm a big fan of the magma rifle) and the enemies are suitably challanging to face. The level setup is similar to Paranautical Activity, but feels much more refined: Walk into a room, fight a mob that spawns (unless you get lucky and theres an item), go to the next room. One room is reserved for a boss that you need to beat to advance. Occasional traps and room conditions, such as move slower but do more damage, change up the formula a bit. Everything is also randomized on every playthrough to keep things fresh.\n\nI enjoy this game quite a bit, easily one of the better rogue-likes and shooters i've played recently.

It's that feeling you get when something just happens to tickle you the right way. Ziggurat is the most fun I had with a first person shooter since Half-Life 2. Fast-paced combat reliant more on reflex and circle-strafing rather than gallery shooting we've grown used to with Modern Military Shooters, which brings me to one thing VERY important to me, color palette, Ziggurat is beautifully crafted and more importantly it's colorful and vivid! The music gets you just in the right mood to keep on challenging this unforgiving mistress each time you fail. With unlockable characters, perks and a variety of challenging enemies, traps and secret rooms, a trope the return of to FPS games I welcome with open hands.\nIt boggles the mind the game is in "Early Access" state.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/meanmeanpork/recommended/308420/","meanmeanpork","PORKPORKPORKPORK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/meanmeanpork/","331 products in account","Ziggurat is a game that harkens back to a much simpler time in the history of the first person shooter genre where a player would pick up weapons, run into a room, blast an assortment of monstrous creatures,  pick up some loot and kick the next door down to start the entire process over again.\n\nAlthough this is an extremely simple way of explaining this game, the actual gameplay is refreshing in a time where the first person shooter genre is filled with many titles that don’t try to do new things.\nIt is not that Ziggurat’s gameplay is entirely new. The shooting itself is obviously inspired by older first person shooter games such as Doom, Heretic/Hexen and Quake. If you have played any of these games, this will be the first thing on your mind when you boot the game up; specifically with the title Hexen as, thematically, both games are about magic wielding main characters and share fantasy themes of wizardry.\n\nZiggurat’s uniqueness lies in how it conjoins this gameplay with “rogue-like” elements in which levels, weapons acquired and character perks are all randomized and change with every play through. This, coupled with the frantic pace of the game play, creates an experience with high replayability, quick satisfaction and, most importantly, fun.\n\nLike many games in the same “rogue-like” genre, Ziggurat has a definite beginning, middle and end that players are capable of reaching in 30-45 minutes of gameplay. This time may be longer if you are skilled at the game but will likely not happen for your first couple times through the game. If games do run long, you do have the option of saving between each level.\n\nEven when you die horribly, the random elements of the game pull you back in and make you want to start over just to see what new configurations you will run into.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you are looking for a game with good replay value. The aesthetic is refreshing and colorful at a time when the genre it belongs to can feel very dull.\n\nAlso, vegetables that try to kill you.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mootNQxxHI\n","October 25, 2014","true","15.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I waited a little bit to get it at first because I was worried it was going to be another stinker, but man was I pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe game uses a randomly generated dungeon that you crawl through in FPS style blasting your way through rooms of enemies using wands, spells, staves, and alchemy. The combat is fast paced, graphically pleasing, and entertaining everytime you pick up and play. You basically work your way from room to room attempting to find a key that allows you to fight a boss to progress to the next floor. As you go, you level up and collect new weapons/items to help you along the way. Death is permanent, so if you die your back to zero. This is a good thing though, as it keeps the game from getting stale or feeling grindy. There is just enough punishment in death to make you feel like you messed up, but not punish you so much you feel like you won't get back to where you were.  You just start a new game and you will be leveling up and slaying baddies again within minutes.\n\nEnemy types are varied and each one brings a different attack strategy and strengths/weaknesses to the table. You will have to constantly be aware of your surroundings and the type of enemies you are being attacked by to survive, always adapting your tactics to what abilities you have in your arsenal and what types of monsters spawned in the room.\n\nOne of the things I love most about this game is that you can pick it up and play for 15 minutes, or sit down and play for 2-3 hours and have a great experience either way. You are allowed to save in between floors and the early levels won't take much longer than 10-15 minutes so it works perfectly.\n\nI feel like this game will only get better from here as the devs have already patched this game several times in the short week that I have owned it. They are fantastic and deserve all the credit they have gotten for this game and so very much more! Do them and yourself a favor by picking up this game and reccomending it to everyone you know!\n\n\nEDIT: upate as of 10/17/15 this game just gets better and better. Every update is lovingly crafted by the devs and adds new rooms, perks, weapons, and enemies. I CANNOT reccomend this game ENOUGH. It is a blast and has easily found itself on the list of my favorite games of all time. I am very close to 100% completing and I have enjoyed every minute of it! THANK YOU DEVELOPERS FOR SUCH A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!\n\nEDIT 2: Took almost 50 hours and I finally 100% completed this game. Worth every second spent. I loved this experience.

If you are a fan of arcadey, run-and-gun FPS's and interested in trying procedurally generated rogue-lite's I would strongly recommend you give this a try.\n\nThe action is fast and frantic, death will come quick and often, but it is fair in my opinion. I have yet to fully clear the game, but I felt each of many deaths were due to my own mistakes instead of cheap tricks from enemies or glitches\n\nThere are many different available weapons and upgrades for your character, which per the Rogue formula are going to be handed out at random, so each run through will be different from the previous. You character has four different weapon slots, each using its own mana (ammo) type, and each of the weapons is has unique effects, but follows along a theme. Books tend to be short range, staves longer range, and alchemy leans towards explosions. You get a choice of randomly selected upgades while leveling up, so you have some limited control over how your character progresses, but it really is up to the random number generator gods on what your end character will be like.\n\nNumerous fantasy monster types, from the demonic to the vegetable, keep things fun and varied as you progress deeper into the Ziggurat. The end boss of each level is a super version of one of the types with additional attacks or the ability to spawn minions. Also along the way to the end boss, you will have rooms with different affects affecting all inside, or traps that being some platforming skills into play.\n\nAs you die, and you will, you will unlock additional weapons, upgrades, and characters that will become available for your next playthrough, so even though each new life starts from scratch, there is some sense of progression and good replay value.\n\nI feel I got more than my money's worth.","November 7, 2014","true","7.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Ziggurat is a FPS, rouge style game.  Only one character is available when you first play, however, as you progress (die a lot) you will unlock other characters.  The monsters in the game are done very well and are fun to battle.  I've found the difficulty ranges from fairly easy (on the easiest mode) to really freakin' hard (on the hardest difficulty).\nThere is a fun leveling up system that allows the player to pick different perks as you progress.  On my first playthrough (on  easy) I got to level 11 and the 4th dungeon floor.\nI do recommend this game for fans of rouge style, FPS, and dungeon crawler games.

While you do all of that you will get hit behind your back, on top of your head and you didn't know.\nToo much enemy homing abilities going on at the same time.\n\nThe best recommendation when in a room full of homing nonsense, walk & shoot, run for a few seconds around so a few shots cleared then repeat. Generally this recommendation applies to every room except the last boss.\n\nYou can only run in one direction and thats forward and if you try to turn you slow down and slide.\n\nEnemies don't give you experience(EXP) when you kill them.\nThey drop these EXP gems, you have to pick them up and they expire if you don't pick them up.\nThis brings up a lot of troubles. Slowers the game pace too much, you'll see why in the failing example.\nAt first you won't mind or care but when very bad random setups start ocurring you'll notice.\n\nIt also brings up the problem of resource management.\nThere are rooms in which killing enemies doesn't yield any EXP at all, these would be the Obelisk rooms and Scavenge rooms.\nThis is a problem because you might be indulged into spending either Spell, Alchemy or Staff ammo in return for no EXP but you can clear the rooms safer? Although with all the homing abilities going on and other rooms still left to clear I don't recommend it.\n\nThere are enemies you can't get close to them so you have to kill them from afar but at the same time you have homing mortars/shots/enemies plus a whole bunch of AoE damage going on, you have to decide when you kill them to give up health and positioning for a bit of EXP or no EXP at all.\nNot putting it slightly, there are enemies with insta-hit shots if you are close to them or the hitbox for their shots and AoE is so big you can't be close to them while walking,\n\nA failing example would be:\n\nSecond floor, very very small room and spawns four Storm Beasts and three Imps plus more combinations of them as you kill them.\nStorm Beasts are flying slow moving fat gargoyle looking creatures who shoot lighting spheres, it can't be dodged if you are close and walking but the room is so small you might as well be running all the time but you can't shoot and run at the same time.\n\nImps are small flying imp looking creatures who shoot three flames across the floor in fan like style.\n\nThe best recommendation is to run around in circles and once in a while walk & shoot but if you walk you'll get hit by Storm Beasts shots, because their hitbox and AoE is big and you'll be against a wall every time.\nStorm Beasts are bullet sponges so trying to kill them with any kind of "efficient" damage output you might have come up with in your run isn't revelant(unless luckily enough you got a good combinaton of weapons).\nAll the while you have these fans of flames shooting at you.\n\nIts good not great, mostly you'll die randomly and in my opinion with more balance tweaking this could become great.","August 19, 2015","false","5.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The inconsistency of the weapons and perks you get from run to run pose the problem; with a good build you should be able to handle any room the game throws at you.\n\nWhen you level up you choose between two perks.  However, some perks are temporary, and the perks are all over the place in terms of usefulness, so you can end up halfway through the game with a very bad character.\n\nYou gain a weapon at the start of each floor.  The weapons are all fairly solid, but as they're randomly obtained there's no guarantee that you will ever get a complete arsenal, and you might get several weapons that serve the same purpose.\n\nAs an example I frequently obtained perks that increased the mana pool for weapons I didn't have and never got, because the other perk choice was temporary or was an overall penalty.  As another example I have beaten the game without finding a Staff.\n\nAn additional poor design choice unrelated to randomness is that experience is a drop the player must pick up and will despawn after some time.  This in and of itself isn't that bad, but when combined with the number of area denial attacks present, the player is often forced to choose between taking damage and missing out on XP; both options are bad.\n\nWhile the gameplay is polished, how well you do in any particular run is largely up to chance.

Map layouts are far more arena-like and not as complex as they were in the classics, though. You must pick from a number of characters (you start with one, but can unlock others) and reach the 5th floor to win, and every floor is randomly generated from a number of pre-built rooms that are then strung together. A floor ends when you beat its boss, and you will need a Portal Key to summon the boss. The game has permadeath and you can only save between floors.\n\nThere is a good variety of weapons (the pool grows bigger as you unlock more of them) spread across 4 categories. The first is the basic wand, whose mana (ammunition) replenishes quickly and automatically for all characters. Different characters will have different properties for this starting weapon, such as faster or slower ROF, a differently-styled secondary attack, less or more accuracy. The second class of weapons are books, whose attacks are typically shotgun-like and  don't consume too much mana. The third type are staves that function as rapid-fire crowd control weapons, and mostly have a primary attack with good accuracy and a secondary that excels at close quarters, burning through your mana rapidly while firing a barrage of projectiles inaccurately. The fourth and last type are weapons that deal area damage. These are usually firearms or throwable explosives, and often have a steep mana cost per use. Some weapons deal self-explanatory status effects, such as poison, stun, or freezing.\n\nYou can find usable amulets that must be recharged (by killing monsters), lore scrolls (these give a large EXP boost) and occasionally perks. You also get to choose between two (or three with the Bookworm perk) random perks on level up. In roguelike fashion, you can find statues in certain rooms that allow you to trade your health or mana (or offer nothing, for a lower chance of success I presume) for a possible bonus. You can get a random effect (Divine Indifference) or even a punitive malus from these statues.\n\nI have thoroughly enjoyed this game so far. The challenge is markedly above average and you can extract many hours of quality gameplay from Ziggurat. The shooting feels tight and fast-paced, and the emphasis on dodging projectiles gives the game an interesting quasi-old-school feel.

That's a monster... and a thing...\n-leveling up is harsh but satisfying, unlocking new abilities as you go trough. Your level is reset to 1 after each death.\n-there are bosses you need to fight to progress trough the levels, but each of them need a key that you have to find around the map. This mechanic can be annoying from time to time, but I like it from the usual "Find the boss and fight him"\n-and lastly, the game is a roguelike genre! That means you can play as much as you want, and (potentially) not get bored sooner or later.\nAs a final verdict, the game is fun to mess around with, casting spells left and right, I give it a 9/10, just because of the homing shots monsters.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/facetioussage/recommended/308420/","facetioussage","facetioussage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/facetioussage/","283 products in account","This game makes me think of Hexen/Heretic in many ways while still carving out it's own unique take.\n\nEssentially, you play as one of a selection of characters with their own initial strengths/weaknesses and navigate through a randomly generated dungeon, proceeding further when you have defeated the boss of that level.  The weapons you begin with (outside of the basic wand) are random as well.  Through numerous playthroughs you will unlock a variety of different weapons, amulets and character abilities (of which you choose from a selection of at least 2 upon each level up) making sure that no two games will play the same.\n\nFor some, the luck-based nature of the randomly generated layouts, abilities and weapons may be a turn off, but I consider it to be one of this game's strengths.  While you only get one life to navigate the Ziggurat, the randomness keeps a constant freshness to the game.\n\nThe basic game is only 5 levels, which makes my approach to this as an old-school arcade game with one life and enough variety in each playthrough to make it worthwhile to revisit.\n\nIf you wish to play a longer version, there is a setting among the difficulties to play it up until your character finally perishes, which I have not yet tried, but I imagine is like a survivial mode.\n\nMost of the randomized skills you earn are at least not harmful, and a few are rather helpful.  You may run across a shrine wih punishes you and some monster combinations are brutally efficient, but I do find that the longer you are able to survive, the easier more things are to deal with.\n\nThe variety of characters to choose from is nice since you can play to their strengths if you are given the right choices at a level up...or at the least, you can minimize their weaknesses to a degree.\n\nOverall the game is challenging and addicting.  If you approach it with the mentality of a randomly generated arcade style game rather than an RPG or other longer game, you should be very pleased with it.\n\nGraphically, I'm fine with the art direction.  There are times that enemies may have attacks that obscure your view with the special effects, but I consider that a part of the natural hazard the game is built on.  In a larger room, you can at least maneuver around it.  Getting trapped in a smaller room with enemies that attack with lots of special-effect laden attacks can be tough.\n\nThe music is just the right amount of background atmosphere needed to fill the game.  The distinctive sounds of various enemies is very helpful in identification of what you are up against.\n\nThe controls are responsive (I'm using a 360 controller to play this) and I have not personally had any difficulty in gettnig my character to perform actions, nor dealt with any slow response time, except insofar as it is built into the character itself, such as a slow firing rate with a particular weapon. So I am very satisfied with the tight and intuitive control of the game.\n\nMilkstone Studios has done a fantastic job on this and I recommend it to anyone looking for a game that is simple enough to pick up and play, but challenging enough to keep them engaged.  Another nice touch is the ability to create a save point between stages in case you only have a little bit of time to play and want to get back to your game later.","December 11, 2014","true","42.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You are a wizard and your goal is to fight through a dungeon one floor at a time, find each floor's portal key, summon and defeat the boss, and progress to the next floor. Each floor has a random layout, and there is permadeath, so every time you die, you're back to the start of the first floor.\n\nThe FPS mechanics are great - fast movement, responsive aiming. There's no regenerating health, instead you need to find potions or make use of some other magical abilities. There are four different weapon classes - wand, spell, staff and arcane. Each class contains multiple weapons but you can only carry one of each at a time. Most weapons are direct fire projectiles, but some have special functions such as grenades, spread shots, and poison damage over time.\n\nThere is a wide variety of enemy types, from skeletons and mages to killer carrots, weird plant things and those annoying floating skulls from Doom. They have a mixture of melee and ranged attacks, and some have special abilities such as summoning minions, invisibility or firing homing projectiles.\n\nThe environment itself can be a danger too. You'll encounter various trap rooms - fireballs, spinning blades, lava pits, floor spikes. Some fight rooms have special rules such as increased or decreased damage or movement speed, enemies spawn in pairs or enemies release a poisonous cloud on death. And you can gamble health or mana at shrines - hopefully you'll get an ability upgrade, but you might suffer a downgrade.\n\nEvery time you level up you can choose one of two randomly selected upgrades, and every completed playthrough - success or failure - unlocks more that are available to choose in future playthroughs. There are the usual increased health/mana/weapon damage but also more creative ones such as do more damage when below 25% health or regain health by breaking crates.\n\nIts a short game - there are only 5 floors and my successful playthrough took just over an hour - but there are 12 unlockable characters to play as with different strengths and weaknesses, and 3 difficulty levels plus an endless mode, so there is some replayability.\n\nMuch of the game is based on random luck - which weapons you find, which upgrades you get at level up, will you receive a positive or negative if you choose to gamble at a shrine - but I don't feel like the game is actively trying to screw me over. It feels fair, and I feel like my FPS skills can help me survive most bad situations, which in turn makes the game fun to play.\n\nI haven't noticed any bugs. Controls are mostly rebindable, however you can't bind anything to middle mouse which is my standard jump key in pretty much every FPS, so the trap rooms that require navigating platforms feel a bit unnatural.\n\nOverall Ziggurat is a pretty good game, and I'd definitely recommend it if you're a fan of either FPSes or roguelikes. I think there's enough content here to justify a full price purchase, which is already quite cheap.","January 8, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Random levels and weapon drops make it even more fresh, than many shooters out there. I followed Cynical Brit's video review before I bought this game, so I knew exactly what to expect, Strategy isn't as much of importance as sheer luck is. Luck, meaning that game needs to generate every kind of weapon matching every kind of mana you have. Ability to dodge projectiles and run from mad carrots is also a required skill. Anyway, I already got thru all levels with two characters and I will definitively play again. After a stressful day at work there's not much that I can vent on, but Ziggurat won't fail me in this task anytime soon.

The initial goal you will be set upon is to get through a five-level dungeon. Each level is randomly generated similarly to TBOI, and is cleared by finding and obtaining a Portal Key and then defeating the floor boss.\n\nThe gameplay is simply first-person shooting. However, you have access to another weapon at the beginning and can hold up to 4 at any time. Each weapon - Magic Wand (default), Spell Books, Staves and Alchemic Weapons. Each weapon type has different mana pools and can be upgraded when leveling up by picking the corresponding perk. Each weapon also has a alternate fire mode. This grants the player many interesting ways of fighting enemies.\n\nBy picking up 'knowledge gems' from fallen enemies, the player can level up and select a perk from 2 randomly chosen from the perk pool, much like Crimsonland's level up. The upgrades chosen can widely vary and determine a playstyle and how you approach the dungeon's deeper levels. It is entirely feasible to focus purely on staves and upgrade on purely the mana pool and regen of staves. You may also find amulets which grant different temporary benefits, much like items in TBOI\n\nThe RNG of the game would be the rooms you will find in each level. There are enemy rooms, trap rooms, shrines where you pray and can receive gifts or punishments and treasure rooms which can hide an enemy ambush. With enough experience, it is possible to take a peek at the room, determine the type, then decide whether you wish to challenge the room or not. At times, this RNG about room placement can completely destroy a run even in the early stages.\n\nAfter each defeat, with the gold gathered you will unlock items, weapons, perks to be added to the existing pool for your use on the next run. Once certain feats are completed, characters will also be unlocked. Each character has their advantages and disadvantages, granting a different experience with each of them.\n\nWith that said, Ziggurat is a content-rich game which shows finesse at this genre of games. I fully recommend anyone who likes random elements happening in their games to have a go at Ziggurat.","January 13, 2015","true","9.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Reminds me of games like Hexen, Serious Sam, & Will Rock.\n\n\nA single play-through will run anywhere from 1-2 hours depending how skilled you are. Die and it ends a bit sooner than that. Sometimes I'll take the daily challenge and die within minutes.\nYou get only one chance to fight your way through five levels of the Ziggurat, each larger and a bit more difficult than the last. Die once and it's all over. Enemies drop health globes, and there are certain abilities and perks you can get that will modify how you regen HP.\nThere's a random boss on each floor, each with a different attack type and unique phases. Once you learn to defeat these bosses, they will never again present a challenge to you, even if you're only left with your wand.\nChoose between a wand with unlimited mana that regenerates slowly, or an array of magic spells, enchanted staves, and mechanical weapons like crossbows or bomb launchers with limited mana pools with unlockable perks and abilities that modify how you regen MP.\nUnlock abilities, perks, new weapons, and even characters at a good pace to keep the game interesting. Killing monsters in the rooms of the Ziggurat will yield XP granting knowledge globes, but be sure to pick them up before they disappear.\nUnlockable characters begin with special bonuses, or handicaps that increase the challenge. When you die, your score is posted to the leaderboards so you can compare yourself to all others who've challenged the ziggurat.\nAnd my favourite part of the game: The Daily Challenge. Each day, a challenge is presented to all players. You only have one chance to defeat it and you must defeat it in one sitting.

Its a fast paced fantasy-FPS with procedural maps and permadeath. Think Heretic or Hexen, sped up fast with permadeath and random maps/drops. Yes, it has a minor "EXP" mechanic. Every level you get a choice of two character options and you pick one. (ie "healing potions heal you more but your max health is dropped vs carry more Staff mana) Other options to choose from unlock as you play. You start with the ability to play one guy and unlock more as you beat challenges (they are static - each playthrough adds to the total). Its not an RPG, though. Or a Roguelike, in the sense of a "game like Rogue" - Note: Roguelike DOES NOT mean "permadeath and randomness," although I see it getting used that way a LOT lately.\n\nThere is no stats, no inventory beyond the "one of each type of magic you can carry", no party, NPCS (that Ive found anyway) or building a char. Theres a story, but its not really the main focus nor can you seem to affect it. So if youre looking for a FPS RPG, go elsewhere.\n\nFor what this game *is* though, its fun. If you love fast paced FPSes, you'll be in heaven here. There is no health regen besides  items, so when you get hit, thats it. You cant hide and regen. Each weapon has a mana pool (there is 3 different pools - each associated with a color and weapon type) , only the weakest of which regens. So you want to use your stronger stuff sparingly. You'll be dodging and jumping all over the place avoiding the enemy projectiles. At least as far as Ive gotten, there is no shield or block button. You have to dodge. And the enemies are also doging as they shoot at you, so you'll find youself dancing all over the place while firing off blasts from your weapon du jour. (except for the weakest wand which you always start with, the weapon drops are random)\n\nThe controller (I dont play M&K) is completely mappable and has sensitivity customizations and so forth. This is a good, if difficult game. I'm not an FPSer, but I can usually do alright. I find myself dying constantly here, though. Its very unforgiving, but fun.","January 22, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Each time you can choose between two random perks.\nAlso you have, beside your main weapons, three types of weapons. Staffs, Spells and Alchemy. For each stage, you get a new random weapon. If you are unlucky, you can get the same weapon on every stage. Each weapon type has its own mana bar, so you have to switch between them, sometimes saving your best one for the boss fight.\n\nWhile playing the game, you will unlock new characters (each with unique playstyle), new perks, weapons and amulets.\n\nThe amulets are a little bit unsatisfying. It is very hard to get one and then you should be lucky enough to get a good one. (sometimes you have good combos like playing a staff guy with a amulet with a + staff attack speed, which felt like an boss insta kill)\n\nCreated from feedback from the community, the developers released a endless mode, which is also nice to play, but getting really imbalanced on the higher stages (I got around floor 30).\n\n\nThe whole gameplay is a little bit like oldschool shooters similar to Serious Sam, where you are in a small room with hundreds of enemys. In Ziggurat every enemy, beside 3 types, have a ranged attack, which can end in a endless storm of attacks in the higher stages of endless mode.\n\n\nThe big con of this game is the great amount of randomness:\nYou can have a great round, rushing through all waves, getting + attack and + defence and good spells.\nYou can have a bad round, loosing weapons, getting negative buffs, bad weapons and the hardest boss.\n\nAnd the game has a lot of randomized parts:\n- enemy encounters\n- rooms\n- loot\n- levelups\n- boosts and debuffs from shrines\n- weapons\n- amulets\n- aditional loot rooms and secret rooms\n\nFrom this look of the game, it doesnt feel right. Is feels like you are playing and playing, until the game decides to let you win. I literally rushed through the game, on my first playthrough, didnt even noticed the final boss. When I encountered him again, I was totally confused, because I had beaten him before and didnt understand, how he was able to kill me now.\n\n\nI dont really get the concept of roguelike games. I like challenging PvE shooters. I also like this game. But I dont like, when a game is playing me.","December 10, 2014","true","24.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

And the first 2 are really small...\nYou have to grind for new wizards (game features permadeath), as Boss is true wall (I succeded after about 15 tries in easy).\nWhen you finally kill boss you take some scroll and back to main menu with litle text... end of story.\n\nGame could be really nice and a successor of Exhumed or Hexen, even Doom 1 &2 as level design is pretty square rooms - symetrical.\n\nBut hey ! It's very lazy work ! Levels have to be more and more numerous, more rooms in each levels etc.\n\nHere all is question of luck (perks, health drop, weapons looted, shrines bless / curse etc...\nSometimes after 2 levels you'd better give up and give another try. (if the LUCK based status doesn't start to get boring, otherwise you just go another game that has a real balance / content).\n\nGame is just a competitive ("Let's check my E-fame and see where I place myself in Pantheon "^^) luck based where fun is no point as you hunt for achievements and points like a Donkey Kong contest in a constant struggle versus your own luck.\nDon't expect dungeon crawler with huge scenario and vasts levels.\nIt's more a solo contest (apparentlly they just gave up with multiplayer feature as they had real bad experience with a previous game... ) where you compete with others thru score and ranking. Not for me for sure.\nThe ziggurat should be a HUGE temple where apprentice would lost himself, with vasts levels of multiple encounters. Not a 10/15 rooms levels (15 with empty corridors ^^)\n\n4/10 for lazyness and randomness that should add some variability in game and not be THE pillar of the game.\n(You loot cards that give you perks, and you have to get lucky or you got no chance to go to / defeat boss)\n\nIn one word : LAZY.

Fast-paced wandplay, large amounts of replayability, ridiculously challenging combat with a large amount of imaginative weapons, perks, characters and items to unlock.\n\nMy only minor gripe would be the lack of enemy variety between levels. Stronger enemies are added as the game progresses, but the weaker enemies from previous levels still spawn, and since each room spawns 2 or 3 types of enemies, you will be fighting those same enemies more than a few times per session. There's still a lot of room for improvement due to the nature of the game, though, and each update comes with bits of content which is good enough. And, again, the sheer variety of weapons, perks and characters to use are enough to ensure each playthrough will be different than the last one.\n\nIf old-school FPS games and roguelites are your thing, Ziggurat is worth every single cent you're going to part with for it, even at base price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/308420/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","Ziggurat, developed by Milkstone Studios, puts you in the shoes of a magic user trying to prove their worth. They will have to do this by taking on a tower that is ever changing. No two games will be the same. Well there is a start and a finish to the tower, of course, but the configuration of the rooms, the enemies you will face, the upgrades you will come across, all of these will be random. You see this is a rogue-like, First Person Casting, fast-paced, dungeon crawler (well actually tower crawler as you will be ascending, not descending). You will have to be fast because if you hesitate, or take too long to act you will be killed in a heartbeat. I say this having died WAY TOO many times to start off.\n\nGraphically this is a game that you really don't get to admire much of when enemies are involved. I will say this though, I love the fact that there is destructible objects in the game where you can blow off a little bit of steam, and if you are really luck perhaps you will find something hidden. There are several different types of rooms that you will have to familiarize yourself to. There is the guardian room (basically the room you will HAVE TO GO THROUGH to get to the next level), the guardian's key room (this is the room you will have to find in order to unlock the guardian that must be defeated to advance in the game), the trap room (this is where you are probably going to spend a lot of time cursing when you need precision and you end up just falling off the platform), the minion rooms (these come in all shape and sizes, basically this is where you will have to kill all the enemies to unlock the doors), the treasure room (a room that can give you a different spell to use, or perhaps something else to help you survive), and to mention one more room you have the, what I like to call, the sacrifice room (this is the room that you can give up some of your magic, nothing, or life to obtain something that might help you out further down the line.\n\nSpeaking of magic there is quite a variety of magical attacks that you will get to use. Some of them will simply come out of your wand, while others will be in the form of a magically loaded gun or bomb. The thing is that you will have your purple shooting wand (which is your basic attack) at your disposal at almost all times, the magic points needed to use this will regenerate over time. The other three types of spells, blue, green, and orange, have to be collected from defeating foes, and those spells of course can cause MUCH MORE damage than the purple.\n\nTo truly survive this game you are going to have to choose your level ups wisely. Once you have gained enough experience you will be given a choice of cards, each card has its own effect, and it will change the game for you. I HIGHLY recommend that you go the route I usually go, and that's the one where if there's a card that allows you to get more out of experience point pick ups. Did I miss out on some of the level ups, absolutely, but I was always leveling up, quickly, I might add, and that allowed me to really pump up my character. I thought that I might have safely made myself over-powered, but the final boss still crushed me like a little bug.\n\nThe enemies in the game all have a very unique look to them, there are bald chickens mixed with lizard looking creatures, there are blobs, there are elementals, there are screaming banshees, there are flying skulls, crab handed demons, and so much more. I really did enjoy the variety of enemies. Well at least the look of them, there were definitely some of them that I really didn't want to see as they seemed to be the ones that chased me right into the grave, over and over again.\n\nTo play this game you have the options of keyboard, or gamepad. I am here to tell you that the gamepad is the ONLY way to play this game. Try as I might with the keyboard and mouse, I was just never fast enough to last very long, but on my first gamepad playthrough, I actually got through the first level of the tower. The game is just so fast, at points, that I couldn't keep up with the pace, especially when it comes to changing spells out so that you can try to do as much damage as possible, and not be left vulnerable.\n\nSo the interesting thing about this game is that no matter how many times you play it, there's always going to be some new wrinkle, or design that is going to keep you on your toes. There's also other heroes that you will unlock as you play the game more and more, so in a way, even when you succeed you will still need to grind if you are going to be able to unlock the whole game.\n\nI guess I should probably wrap up this review at this point. I will tell you this, at first I was ready to rage quit, and never come back to this game again, but once I found the comfort in playing with the gamepad, I definitely started to enjoy this game. Sure there were some difficult times, and some SERIOUSLY close calls (I beat a boss with basically 2 health left, if my spell hadn't killed him he would have killed me). So if you are looking for a fast paced first person shooter (magic casting) game where the levels will never truly be the same, you are going to have to get this game. If you are looking for something that is quick to pick up, this will not be the game for you. This is the kind of game that you have to initially play over and over again so that you can get a feel for it, and then find the best way to survive. This will definitely cut away at potential gamers, but those who are willing to stick it out are definitely going to find a game where you are going to lose track of time, and hopefully find victory. This game gets an 8.2 out of 10.","November 5, 2014","true","3.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I bought it when it just came out of early access, and first of all I was impressed how it blended the fps and rogue-lite genres. It added a great replayability to fps, and a much more in-depth combat system than most rogue-lites.\n\nA second reason is that the UPDATES NEVER STOP COMING. Seriously, I already like the game a lot when it came out. then after some time I managed to beat in on one or two of the classes, and it got me wishing for an endless mode. An update later, there's an endless mode! I think the amount of content has roughly doubled since release and it's all for free.

After that I missed an overall goal to achieve. Yes, the game delivers random rooms, several new item/char unlocks every round, but imo these bring only minor changes to the gameplay. Chars have more/less health, shoot more/less projectiles with standard wand, consume more/less magic energy, the weapons go through fire, ice, poison, etc. but shooting the enemys and moving backwards stays the main tactic no matter what build you have.\n\nAfter a few runs the enemies and the bosses repeat and I saw no reason to go on, because I felt everything being explored and going on would be just a matter of hitting the best highscore.

It's likely the best FPS roguelite there is, and will probably be the best one there is for a while, and it's all because of a few key things.\n\nFor starters, the action is fast-paced. It reminds me of Serious Sam or Painkiller in that you go to an area and must defeat all of the enemies. In order to do so, you must do tons of sprinting, jumping, and avoiding projectiles. There's a lot of movement involved, so your aiming skills and agility are both tested to the maximum. Since you have four weapon slots (and are ALWAYS given a new weapon at the start of the floor, including the first level), you'll always have plenty of tools for getting the job done. All weapons also have a secondary fire, giving the game a lot more depth from the get-go.\n\nIt helps that the game has tons characters, weapons, items, and buffs/defuss, all of which are pretty varied. In true roguelite fashion, you'll die pretty quickly and you'll die many times before you complete your first successful run. Pretty much every time my run came to an end, I unlocked something. The more time you give to the game, the more it gives back.\n\nI can't think of too many complaints other than how there's not much to the general gameplay flow apart from shooting and maneuvering. That's probably all the game needed. If there's ever going to be a crazier sequel, this is probably the best foundation we could hope for, and it truly does help that there's already a lot of variety within the game itself.\n\nThis is what arena-based FPS roguelites should look up to. The game has received plenty of updates since its release and I'm hoping they keep this up.","September 10, 2015","true","15.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is extremely cheap but extremely effective; it makes all the shots meant for wave-management hit the boss and do a LOT more damage.\n\nZiggurat would be a multi-platform HIT if it had many other kinds of enemies, a third-person mode, modding support or tools, scaling damage so that the game could be completed quicker with skill, fan-created levels, and a much wider selection of items, weapons, and ideas.\n\nZiggurat was very close.\n\nWorth $10 to me currently, $15 feels like I'm ever-so-slightly being cheated.","October 6, 2015","false","3.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Wouldn't it be nice if they built one around fun gameplay rather than mediocrity or super extreme fiddly RPG mechanics.\n\nThen suddenly Ziggurat appears. Not the first roguelike FPS but this one nails the Doom feel. Lots of stafing, dodging bullets, a decent variety of guns. All wrapped up in a lovely fantasy motif that no game seems to want to truck with these days outside of a mindless clickfest RPG or Skyrim, but I repeat myself.\n\nFight enemies, collect weapons, level up and get random perks. Unfortunately, the game is hugely swingy on randomness, par for the genre. If you get awful perks or weak weaponry you likely won't see the end of the game so it's not something I would call a "serious" game right yet. If I lose, I think part of that is the game's fault because of all this randomness. Plus, the late game monsters have so much health that the game loses the joy of the early levels and just becomes tedious "hold mouse button against health bars."\n\nThat said, it reminds me of Doom and any game that can do that is on the right track. Easily the best roguelite I've played but that isn't saying much. I still cannot recommend it. It's fun for a while but it just doesn't hold up in the long run.","December 27, 2014","false","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Every few rooms you'll get a level up, but instead of getting cool and interesting new skills, you get a random selection of a pool consisting entirely of minor stat boosts, such as a 5% increase in maximum mana pool size. The "spells" and other weapons are all just guns that shoot differently shaped projectiles. Aside from some that have a random chance to freeze enemies, I did not encounter a single item over 6 playthroughs that did anything but damage enemies in various shapes.\n\nThis game has far more in common with Serious Sam than it does Binding of Isaac, Rogue Legacy, or any other roguelike, although there is less variety in this game than in those. For comparison to your favorite roguelike(s), consider that you are virtually guaranteed to see multiples of the same items or skills between any two playthroughs. That is how pathetic the variety of content is in this game.\n\nEverything technical is done well. It runs nicely, everything feels smooth, but you literally start feeling the repetitive nature of the game after a SINGLE playthrough. This stands against everything a roguelike should be. I cannot overexaggerate what little variety this game has. It seriously needs ten to twenty times as much content to be considered a good roguelike, and more than that to be considered a really great one. As it is, it's more like a generic mage-shooter that's very short and cannot be saved.\n\nExample of a level up:\n\n---\n\nChoose one of the following:\n\n1.

Neither a good roguelike, nor a worthy successor of Heretic/Hexen. But hey, pretty graphics!\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is a simplistic arena first person shooter/casual roguelike RPG hybrid. Graphics are well polished and pretty, for an Unity3D game, but there's really not much content. You have to complete 5 small levels, killing the boss at the end of each and that's it. Every time you play, room placement is randomized and the bosses are selected from a bigger pool, except for the last one. All levels look mostly like reskins of each other and reuse the same rooms under a different coat of paint. Also, most bosses are enlarged reskins of normal monster types. Permadeath, unforgiving difficulty, cheap traps and cruel RNG are the things that prevent you from completing it in an hour or less. Sure, there are tons of perks and many unlockable characters with different starting skill sets, but the core gameplay will still be the same. And some of these monsters, some of that platforming make you want to play Daikatana instead. They have many area denial attacks, attacks with shotgun-like dispersion, or fire multiple homing projectiles that are very hard to avoid without taking damage, especially when confined to a small room, especially when playing from first person perspective. And, of course, they love to spawn behind your back. As result, some fights are very unfair and most are simply a chore.\nupdate:\nInitially, I (grudgingly)recommended this game, but later decided to change my review. Despite an hour or two of fun overall, I had enough of frustration and boredom, and therefore can't recommend it to other people. I got high on expectations, but later encountered too much of poor, lazy game design. Describing all the flaws would take pages and it was already done by other reviewers. I liked their reviews a lot, so I'll just join the dark side :)\nupdate2:\nI have to clarify for people who, apparently, have played neither classic textmode roguelike RPGs, nor classic 90s shooters, like Heretic. Played plenty of both, this game does not compare for reasons now listed in the first line of this review.","March 13, 2015","false","14.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","8"

You run around and shoot wands and spells, but they could be machine guns and shotguns.  There are no stats, no character development, no gear besides a few weapon (just like in action games). The maps are randomized each run, but the rooms are extremely bland, basically squares with a few obstacles or stairs. The monsters vary visually, but don't do much, either run at you, or float around and shoot something at you. The only special attack is waves in the ground you have to jump over.\nWhat is extremely distracting is the fact that you must constantly pick up loot falling from the killed enemies that disappears rather fast, so you can never concentrate on the combat. Every now and then, you get a not very significant upgrade. Some rooms contain shrines you can pray at, and they either reward you or punish you, which is honestly rather dumb.\n\nBesides constant circle straffing and shooting, there is little to do, so the game makes sure you die often and play the first two levels over and over (there is only five levels altogether). Each failure brings some "unlocks" to soften the tedium.\n\nYour mileage may vary depending on how much you love constant circle-strafing while mowing down the same dumb mobs. For me, it got old rather fast, but if you feel you want some brainless shooting entertainment, the game is perfect.\n\nOn the positive side, the game is rather nice graphically, especially for an indie game, and emanates that "polished" feeling. No crude art, no hiccups, no embarrasing bugs. It's a well tested and carefully crafted product with obviously focused vision behind it.\n\nI don't like it that much personally, but I can imagine it's just what some people want. So I give "no" for my personal opinion and for the rather shallow content and scope, but I would give the game 60-70 percent out of a 100. It's not original (Heretic inspiration is obvious), it's not ambitious, but it's rather well made and polished. It makes rather great first impression, but the aftertaste is not all that pleasant.","May 5, 2015","false","4.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

An issue this game has when compared to other rouge-like games such as ‘The Binding of Isaac’ or ‘Enter the Gungeon’ is a lack of a feeling of constant progression. In the previously mentioned examples you feel as though you are constantly unlocking useful items and areas even when constantly failing. In Ziggurat, you unlock items at the end of your runs, but they don’t feel impactful. This lack of impact permeates the whole game. The level up bonuses feel insignificant (slightly more mana or health for example) and won’t ever effect the way you play the game. The same could be said of many of the weapons with few having a big impact on enemies leading to them feeling more like peashooters than effective weaponry.\n\nBut as I said at the start the game is fun and you can sink a few hours into it easily. If you are dying for a first person rouge-like experience then this is probably one of the best you will find. It just doesn’t stand up to other non fps games in the genre.","May 19","false","3.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The main character studied to be a mage for 20 years and in all that time learned how to use every weapon in the game but only brings a wand that shoots "pew pews" to his biggest challenge.\n\nGameplay wise this game is solid but lacking, nothing new or original, just the same waves of weird looking enemies that swarm you with particle effects and themselves with every room you step into, the weapons are all very simple and straightforward. You have a wand for a fallback plan and you can pick up three other weapon types; Area of effect weapon, rapid fire weapon, and a strategic weapon. Each has a few different variants but you can hold three at the same time so in the end it's just preference between heatsink or freeze- poison or damage- etc. It gets old fairly soon and you may get dizzy from the way your character sways like a flower in a tornado.\n\nThe map is a small assortment of rooms connected by short hallways in five barely different floors, it's a short game.\nOn each floor you have one treasure box room, a jumping puzzle, a key room, a boss room, a secret room, and the rest are just filled with enemies that spawn once you step in and the door is locked behind you.\n\nThe graphics are decent but nothing you haven't seen before and nothing that will make you gape in awe but they are standable.\n\nThe music there does little more than set the tone with a good choice of instruments but not a single tune that stuck with me or is worth hearing again.\n\nAll in all it's a game where you spawn and grab a weapon then move fast enough to avoid enemy projectiles and throw your own until you beat the five floors, nothing really stands out, not worth $15 more like $3-$7. Eldritch has a lot more freedom and sets a tone that makes you feel and fear the world around you and forces you to think outside the box and not just shoot everything that moves.","May 5, 2015","false","5.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's just repetitive to me; the spells feel weak and shoddy, compared to the monstrous, epic and memorable weapons you see in classics like UT '99 and Quake, and the RPG elements are barely there; they seem to make no difference.

I've sunk 100+ hours into Torchlight. I've only sunk two hours into Ziggurat, but I feel like I've played Ziggurat for 100 hours. Yes, its in the first person perspective. But with the mechanics, environments, and art style it still seems like Torchlight, et al.\n\nIf I were new to the genre, I'd probably like Ziggurat a lot. It nails down certain elements that make it an effective dungeon crawler. In the two hours I've played it I was disinterested but not frustrated. My main criticism of it is that it feels like a tech demo, with a very limited scope and a pseudo-story that only exists to establish a setting. It masterfully pads things out with a random number generator, though, which is why this issue isn't fatal. I imagine that a sequel won't have this issue, but I hope it won't use the RNG as a crutch like this game does.\n\nI can see people new to the genre enjoying this game.

And for some reason, the atmosphere reminds me of Hexen. Anyway, these stuff aside, this game is another one of the high replay value - low cost games. It combines roguelite elements with first-person shooter, and the result is pretty much satisfying I must say.\n\nEach time, you play in a different setup, and as you progress through the game, you gain experience and shape your character. You can unlock new characters and more by playing the game, and/or doing the requirements. Much like some of those other roguelite games; just like Binding of Isaac, Risk of Rain or Nuclear Throne.\n\nGraphics are satisfactory, fits the game. Sounds are a bit lackluster, so is the music though. The three games I mentioned above have super good soundtracks, and they spoiled me a little bit. Gameplay is adequate, but the spells/weapons could use diversity. One thing that'd have added a lot of diversity would be the ability to dual-wield one handed items, and chain certain effects together.\n\nIf you are a roguelite fan, and/or first-person shooter fan that'd like to try something different, give this game a try.","January 1, 2015","true","17.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198011292952/recommended/308420/","76561198011292952","Critical, biatch!","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198011292952/","142 products in account","BEFORE YOU READ THIS KEEP IN MIND I PLAYED ONLY NORMAL MODE SO EVERYTHING IS BASED ON THAT\n\nSummary: A modest, but attractive, first person roguelike game. It is a procedually generated game. Bought it first week of release and since then there have been 2 updates and a hotfix announced in 2 weeks, the second update adding 15 more room designs a day ago. Apparently, this was an early access game and got out of that phase! It has platforming elements and in first person it can get frustrating for some people. The difference between a good and exceptional player is dodging. I am mediocre in dodging so i rely on damage reduction perk more. The FOV slider lets you have Quake FOV and you can also go fast. Graphic style cartoonish, game runs on my laptop (i mean toaster) at max resolution medium graphics with 20-30 FPS.\n\nCompany cares about the game, there is decent weapon variety (4 weapon types), you have normal and alt fire possibilities. You have amulets with various effects and are recharged by killing enemies (no cooldown on them), you can choose perks everytime you level up to help you have a good run. Decent enemy variety. Every game i played (i think 20 or so) i got the same enemy combinations only a couple times and in different orders. New rooms were added so room variety also increased. Goal is to beat all 5 levels. You have decent character variety too, with different stats and perks. You have to unlock every character (which i've done in 7-8 hours of gameplay). You have to play to unlock perks, amulets and weapons.\n\nRecommended for: people who tolerate first person platforming, love roguelike genres, enjoy playing a lot to unlock more stuff to play a lot to unlock more stuff to YOU GET THE POINT. If you love magic, it's a bonus because it's all wizardry! Also people who love aiming.\n\nWall of text: You die, you're done. Everytime you die or finish the game you unlock new perks, weapons and amulets. Perks are obtained through levelups and they play a big role in having a good run or a bad run. You have 4 weapon types: wand, spells, staves and alchemy.\n- Wand is your basic weapon with regenerating mana but it is good or bad depending on the character.\n- Spell weapons are tomes that have short-medium range and decent damage.\n- Staves are usually rapid fire weapons but i just unlocked a staff that has low fire rate and high damage so there is variety in that as well.\n- Alchemy is sheer destructive power, bombs and explosive weapons.\nEach weapon has a mana pool. Spell, staves and alchemic mana does not regenerate and you fill up their mana by picking up mana gems.\nEvery weapon has alt-fire which adds to 8 possible attacks if you have all 4 weapons. You generally start with 1 random spell, staff or alchemic weapon at the start and if you get lucky in the next levels you get the other weapons.\nAmulets are dodgy because half the time i never got them, 10% of the time i got them in the last level and the remaining time i got lucky at the start and got one.\nPerks are unlocked the more you finish a playthrough (either through killing last boss or dying) so you get more variety in your choices. There are "gambling" perks (e.g. gamble your life: either refill your health or lose 25% of your max and current health), high tradeoff perks (e.g. double weapon damage but triples mana cost), normal, scaling perks the more you select them (e.g. go faster, select perk 5 times to go super sanic). Also perks that refill your mana or health are present too. I prefer scaling perks cause i don't like gambling or severe tradeoffs.\nDrops from monsters disappear in time so you should really try to pick up experience orbs before they disappear. That levelup can really make a difference.\nBoss variety is decent, they are easy to deal with on normal mode. Monsters and bosses have an easy-to-memorise attack pattern, so trial and error! Monsters can also be champions with different effects based on their colours. Learn them and prioritise killing them if you think they are a threat.\nThere are different room types. There are normal rooms where monsters spawn, sometimes with differnet effects such as mosnters being weaker, monsters attacking faster, the player having lower/higher fire rate, only champion monsters etc. This effect occurs randomly, sometimes not at all. One day you will feel my pain when the effect of lower movement speed was in and i died cause of it (BECAUSE YOU NEED TO DODGE). There are treasure rooms where sometimes you get a perk, amulet, exp, health, mana or it's an ambush and monsters will attack you. There are shrines where you can sacrifice health or mana for different effects (gifts, indifference, punishment). Gifts are good, punishments BAD and indifference are tradeoffs such as higher mana pool but bigger mana cost. There is also one shrine where you can sacrifice nothing. You can still get punishments from health and mana shrine sacrifices.\nThere is a boss room, where you need a portal key from the portal key room to start the boss fight. There are hazard rooms (on the minimap: yellow for being dangerous to traverse such as lava; red for hazardous room with a chest at the end with a reward: weapon, perk, amulet etc). There is a room with a lore scroll that gives you an experience boost. Destroying objects such as books and graves can give you dropped items like health. Even after you get every lore scroll they still spawn with a random page to give experience.\nThere are secret rooms which give a nice reward and contain info about Milkstone's various games. I won't tell you how to find them but i can tell you there is one on each level. TRIAL AND ERROR!\n\nJudging by this wall of text, the game is pretty good. It has good variety and i can see it being an enjoyable and attractive game for people who love the roguelike genre. Aiming and dodging are the defining factors of combat (unless you have level 5 thick skin perk which reduces damage, then you just don't care). There are enough things to learn and unlock to keep one hooked for 10 hours. The price compared to the amount of hours i put in, and will put in later, was totally worth it.","November 7, 2014","true","16.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

Then it just gets stupid. Several of his attacks are effectively unavoidable, so unless you managed to get lucky with your build and items you're screwed. They advertise this as being a game of skill and it largely is, but the final boss kind of goes against this. Don't be deceived by the gameplay of your first few hours, they really messed up the design of the final boss. What's worse is that you can't really improve quickly against the final boss because you then have to play through all the stages again, even though you probably don't feel like they're worthy of your time because you've already gotten to the boss. This is one of the design issues with roguelikes and they haven't solved it here. How are you supposed to get better at fighting a boss if you only get to make one attempt every hour? This is fine in a turn based roguelike because you have all the time in the world to think, but in an FPS you don't have time to process everything so it really hinders learning a bosses patterns. Too bad, the rest of the game is quite fun. It's all just preparation for major disappointment as you get to the final boss.","June 16, 2015","false","1.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's not highest priority though, but it should be done sometime during the following months." - Quote from developers\n\nI found about this "feature" only after I came back to continue playing and had to start from beginning !? Could you at least warn people about it, or maybe explain how many rooms there are, say with loading screen 1/5 so  the player would at least know how much time to put into this ? Where is the logic behind it?\n\n- The levels are kinda dull, yes there are rooms with different random monsters, random traps and rewards, but they are pretty much the same and it just becomes boring too quickly.\n- Swarms of monsters spawning all over the room. Now this is challenging true, but would it be nice for monsters not to randomly spawn behind you. It would be ok if we had a minimap so I could figure out if there is somebody behind me, but right now I have to run around the map in order to not get hit. What was the whole point of this game mechanic ? Some people brought Doom as an example of what this game plays like, well in Doom when monsters spawned (in a rare cases) they made a sound that you could use to understand where the thread is coming from and avoid getting damage.\n- Rewards are minimal. There are rewards in the game, but feels like the only thing I am getting - cards. It would be nice to have something more than that, just getting another Lvl + 2 card doesn't seem that rewarding to me.\n- Odd strafing controls, Why I cannot strafe in diagonals (with keyboard), only in straight lines? Pretty much all FPS games allow you to hold SHIFT and go in any direction ?\n\nHopefully some of the things can be improved so I can review it again.","December 30, 2014","false","3.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It feels like a dark twisted cartoon themed world at times and that's really nice.\n+ The audio (for the most part) is well done. The music at times is mystical however the weapon sound effects do lack some umpf behind them.\n\nCons- For some reason it feels too repetitive early on as you encounter the same type rooms and enemies very frequently.\n- There's nothing really to do in the rooms, you just enter and fight spawning enemies. It'd cool if there were some kind of interactables in the certain rooms.\n- Some room special traits are f*cking awful and not fun in the slightest i.e. Can only attack when in air, Scavenger (can only attack enemies after you've collected some scattered orbs).\n- Feels like I have to grind to unlock the majority of items\perks which gets pretty boring.\n- The perspective feels off. It feels like the player is too close to the floor. Either that or you're playing as very short characters.\n- The bosses, I hate all of the bosses I've fought so far, they all behave in the exact same way. Spawn in, summon some ads, charge at you (give or take) and do a large attack. I would've love some variety in this aspect because as it stands you've basically encountered all bosses after your very first boss fight.\n- You don't get experience after defeating enemies it drops to the floor which does disappear after a while.\n\nIrritations- Why do the items left on the floor vanish, I mean I feel like this shouldn't even be a thing any more. Player's computers are extremely powerful these days to accommodate the excess memory usage required for the items. For me, items should only disappear of the player's pc does not have enough memory to allow for extra optimisation.\n- Weaponry feels a bit samey or too similar to present day military weapons. For instance the base wand is an automatic weapon, you get a grenade with distance notches. How about some charge weapons where the longer you charge it the more powerful it becomes. Or how about some cursed weapons which have a negative connotation for the player but is generally stronger in all aspects.\n- The perks feel a bit lacklustre it's either that or I haven't unlocked a ton of them.\n\nVerdictWhile the gameplay for the most part is fun, it's marred by some odd design choices which detract from the fun at times. I feel like this game just isn't for me or that I just don't have the patience to soldier through the repetition as I was simply performing the exact same things I did in my previous runs being enter room, fight enemy, pick boring perk, circle strafe boss. Also, I found myself saying these lines "Why can't I attack", "What's hitting me" and "Well that room was annoying" way too often while playing. And while I've only played a meager 3Hrs as of this review I don't feel like I'll miss out by not continuing. So while I do like what I've played so far I cannot recommend it.","May 27","false","4.1"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Nobody's really done this category, so with that in mind, there's nothing to compare this game to besides other roguelikes.  But on that front, I don't think it succeeds.\n\nThe basic gameplay is good.  It has RPG components but most items are just weapons with different types of ammo.  The visual and sound design here are satisfying and it feels good to shoot stuff.  The enemy design is kind of weak - there's not really any enemies that have creative behavior or interesting silhouettes or scary weapons or unique voices.  The bosses are mostly just bullet sponges.  But as far as the core act of pointing a weapon and shooting at stuff while strafing around, that feels pretty good.\n\nThe map generation is decent.  The room shapes are all square/rectangular, and there are set types with preset changes in elevation or props or whatever - it's just the door placement and configuration of connections that switches, so you'll get pretty familiar with the possible room types within the first hour or two.  So exploring loses its veneer pretty quickly, especially once you realize that there aren't really any fun upgrades.  There's not that many weapon types, and there's nothing that really changes the way you play.  And that's what I mean about it not comparing well to good roguelikes.\n\nA good roguelike has you playing differently every single run.  You found a different weapon this time so now you take a different strategy.  You ran into 3 rooms in a row with a certain enemy type and now you're out of some resource and suddenly you're desperate and scared.  You chose to go with a projectile weapon early on but now you can't find ammo and you don't have any melee weapon.  Those are the situations that make roguelikes unique, that make them compelling and exciting.  Ziggurat doesn't have that.  It's just pick up stuff and shoot at stuff.  It never really changes that much.  The available character types aren't fundamentally different from each other.  It's just flat.\n\nThere's a worthy foundation here to build on.  The game could be quite great.  It's well-made.  But it's not compelling.  It doesn't tap into what makes procedural dungeon generation, random enemy placement, random item spawns, and so on - it doesn't tap into what makes those mechanics exciting and interesting.","June 14, 2015","false","20.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It's great to look at, with polished design and a style that successfully channels old fantasy FPS games like Heretic and Hexen. It's attempting to create an FPS/rogue-like hybrid, but unfortunately it stumbles on both counts. As a roguelike, it takes a Binding of Isaac approach, unlocking more available items as you complete certain tasks on each run. But none of the things unlocked feel particularly interesting. As an FPS the shooting does not feel tight, nor very effective.\n\nUltimately, my main issue with Ziggurat is that of balance. Enemies are damage sponges that take way too many hits to bring down, even with the allegedly more powerful weapons that consume mana. Enemies in the first few levels are already deploying massively-damaging AoE attacks that are almost impossible to dodge when facing them en masse, and enemies randomly plopping into rooms turns the game into a constant boring slow-paced circle-strafe affair.\n\nI had fun for the first 20 minutes or so, but that was about it.\n\n","January 15, 2015","false","1.7"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","1"

I could imagine walking past this in an arcade as a kid, waiting for my turn while watching people popping quarters between lives, and typing in my initials as ♥♥♥ into the high score board once I ran out of allowance. However, this isn't an arcade game; It calls itself a dungeon-crawling RPG, and should then be held up to those standards. Is a 5 level dungeon with floors consisting of a dozen or so randomized rooms a proper dungeon crawler? No. The only definitive RPG element here is picking between two perks after killing so many enemies. So what's left? A magic-based FPS? Bunny-hopping and circle-strafing to dodge bullet hell spell spam?\n\nZiggurat is extremely underwhelming. Short on content, the "rogue-lite" "depth" of this game (which is increasingly becoming an excuse to be lazy) means you'll just be replaying the same 5 levels over and over with different characters that you can unlock. If the game was 20 or even just 10 levels long, with more rooms, you might have an actual game here. As it stands, I feel like I spent $12 on a paid demo. I do not recommend this game as it stands unless the devs really step it up and add more content.","October 27, 2014","false","3.5"," 24 of 54 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","24","54","0","1"

XD\nSo let's begin:\n\nThe game have a really good start, it puts a good variety of enemies and trap rooms in the first rooms, and keep adding some more for each floor,it has secret rooms, it unlocks new stuff based on how far you went and it locks the hard and endless modes to keep you curious until you beat your first run. (that took me 2 tries, around 3 hours)\n\nAfter then, you begin to feel the bad side of the game... you notice that the building only have one plane per floor, some rooms have highs and lows, but all exit in the same height, the whole building have a exagerrated height and makes you feel like dwarf. The rooms start to repeat thenselfs a lot and are little decoration to make the things look different, they don't mix too, as you will never see a monsters with traps.\n\nThe monsters that fill the rooms doesn't offer danger, your resistence is really high and only some of then can hit you for more of 10% if you don't sit like a duck, so you won't really feel the hits. Even bosses don't put enough firepower, as all then dilute to call minions to make the damage for then, making battles more a cannon fodder avoid and burst damage than a intense fight.\n\nFighting doesn't bring emotion as you advance because you doesn't fight something harder, but because the rooms become overcrowded with enemies and shoots that you don't have distance and space to avoid, you will soon forget the damage you are taking just to kill the next enemy quickly, and taking such damage soon becomes a soulless habit.\n\nThe weapory is really big, but a lot redundant, the adition of secondary fire to all then shows potential, but the developer tried too hard to balance the two modes that only some of the alternative fires seen to offer some situational advantage. The perk and character variety is wide too, but all then only have passive abilities changes and won't make you play much different, only use a little more X than Y.\n\nThe sum of the parts makes a solid a game, but a very bland one, the runs doesn't have much difference between they ,even the secret passage crack is the same weapons and perks doesn't make you act different to the different types of enemies. The game have variety, but the pieces doesn't interact with each other. If you want something for a casual play, go for it, if you are a veteran, avoid.\n\nAny questions? You can ask at the comments! :)\n\nP.S.:The music you listen in the trailer plays in the last fight, most other music is not that good.\n\nTrivia: Your first run have a high chance of success because there's a lot of healing perks concentrated, later runs will have more perks, but will be less healing.","January 20, 2015","false","30.9"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

Essentially what I'm getting at is, you're not building a character, you're choosing random buffs as you level, which is bleh from an RPG standpoint.\n\nBasically you clear one room at a time, and if you die, well, you're dead. Then you get to start the game all the way over at the beginning with nothing.

First off.. controls are horrible. The movement system makes to sense. I get it you want your game to be different but not being able to strafe in a FPS style game is not only confusing (since every other single FPS style game like this you can) but it also makes it extremely hard to play. Secondly, if you die even ONCE you have to start over from level one with no additional skills. Huge turnoff seeing as how there isn't a tutorial or even hints on how to play. Got to level 4 died once to a lava jump puzzle and had to start all over again. Whats the point of playing this game if you can't progress. Granted I've beat DS on NG+7 so if I invested the time I could probably beat this game. But the fact of the matter this game isn't quality enough for players to invest more than a casual interest into it. Let's not forget that the actual FPS part of it.. shooting is not bad but not ahh accurate. You shot in one spot on a mob standing perfectly still and it decides to become a curve-ball style shot.\n\nShort version: Don't buy this game. It's not fun and you can't play it 'casually' which is the marketing on this type of games.","December 28, 2014","false","1.0"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"

Now until here it sounds good and interesting but there are things that i dont like at the moment and looking sceptical for the games some progress but i hope i will be wrong with my worries:\n\n- Devs are open for suggestions but focusing to keep the game ``small`` with tweaking the current problems limiting the games potential in my opinion, they tend to respond to topics and suggestions that are ``worth`` for the price which is understandable but still counter productive for the final version of the game cause many suggestions cant be make true but i can await a compromise here since i have bought the game.\n\n- Floor 1 and 2 are very easy to complete even without perks there is some balancing issues here.\n\n- Lagging on massive enemy hordes.\n\n- Game uses the Unity engine that is not ideal for FPS games, also limiting the games freedom in my opinion.\n\n- Making the game rogue lite instead rogue like makes the game boring at times when you are not in combat. Rogue like would ve bring more variety in the average level structure and some surprising moments.\n\nAll in one this game is promising many things in the ``unused`` dungeon crawler FPS section in video games, sub genres are really difficult to make games that everyone would like but this game has the basics to make a unique game. If the devs will be more open for suggestions and making things that they promised this game will be alot of fun. This game is away from wasting your money in the current state but i will not recommend this game for now. If you are interested in this game but are unsure to buy or not, check the forums frequently what have changed for the game.","August 18, 2014","false","7.8"," 13 of 41 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","13","41","0","0"

For 10+ bucks you can get much better and complete games. Worth at most 99 cents, which is the usual price for an app these days. There is not much content in this game to keep it entertaining.\nDie over and over again to slowly activate new characters (with slightly different weapon and skill setup) for minimal variance.\nIt is a pure FPS, but any other FPS I can imagine is waaaay better.\n\nThe game consist of aim & shoot. Straining and repetive.\n\nOccasionally switch weapon and die, eventually. The whole "level-up" system seems kind of simplistic, unimaginative and\nsuperimposed. The different "classes" feel unbalanced. Just the second class that gets playable upon a few\nmonster kills&deaths, feels like 5 times more powerful. Ouch.\n\nPro:\n- simple FPS gameplay, easy to get into\n- colourful, minimalist but fast visuals\n- randomized levels & loot\n- kind of difficult, perma-death\n- Some variety of monsters with different behaviour\n- "developer rooms" showing other (failed) games of the same designers..\n\nCons:\n- very grindy, new upgrades & items are only activated upon death\n- lacking room design (square and flat) sometimes little room to dodge enemies\n- lacking cover system, homing 'missiles' or clouds tend to hit you anyway\n- level ups are weak and meaningless, as you often get to choose from 2 "cards" which in most cases you can also get as loot\n- very limited combat tactics, as each room is concealed once you enter it (small rooms with lot of aoe monsters tend to be rather unfair)\n- stupid jump-on-that-platform rooms (trap rooms)\n","September 8, 2014","false","2.0"," 6 of 26 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","6","26","0","0"

Jumping puzzles are extremely difficult to get used to due to a simultaneously overly rigid air movement and unintuitively floaty friction system.  The progression system actually makes the game harder and less enjoyable, as the perk system on level up is, at base, rather beneficial, and then, every time you die, you'll add more and more perks, most of which you wont ever want to take, but'll show up instead of anything you would.\n\nIf you're looking for something in this genre, Tower of Guns or Paranautical Activity have a lot more to offer.\n\nDon't believe me?

The roguelike elements of this game are procedurally generated dungeons, which seems to mean stock dungeon rooms on a grid in a similar style to binding of isaac. It also has cards you draw after killing a number of enemies, with different bonuses and maluses on them - however, these cards make no substantial changes to how the game is played.\n\nSo to rate this game, we must rate is as an fps, not as a roguelike. Sadly as an fps this is also found lacking. It compares itself to Heretic and Hexen, which certainly in theme it matches, but cannot compete with as a game. There are limitations in the room grid system which take away from the experience - you cannot pace a storyline with randomly generated rooms, your level design cannot have much in the way of verticality - and this has led to each room being these very open, very flat affairs, almost like gladiator arenas. What's more, interesting level elements like traps or pits of lava as shown in the trailer are kept to themselves, separate from monsters. You end up going through the game saying 'this is a puzzle room, i need to avoid the dangerous terrain' and 'this is an arena room, i need to keep moving in a circle'. Even boss fights have not been spared this fate, as you strafe around yet more square, open areas.\n\nOne thing the game has going for it are the differences in the monsters - they each feel unique, with their own ways of attacking and movement patterns. Certainly when different monsters are combined in a room, it can be a challenging and hectic experience, trying to run from the melee monsters while dodging the ranged monsters. Many of the monsters wouldn't feel out of place in a Serious Sam game, with running exploding berserkers and rocket launching dodos and a guy that summons hordes of carrots. Sadly the interesting monsters fall flat in a flat world, with a flat atmosphere.\n\nI cannot recommend this game, like many unity-based fps games it fails to excite, and the roguelike elements have such a minor effect to your character and such a major malus on the level design that it feels like it's letting down what else is here.\n","August 17, 2014","false","1.4"," 24 of 70 people (34%) found this review helpful","34","24","70","0","0"

At least with easy mode, you will occassionally get health potions that you will never get in normal mode but the bosses are about 100 levels above your current level.\n\nLeveling up is a major disappointment. Instead of getting someting cool or useful, you are almost always given some "enhancement" that serves no purpose.\n\nOn top of that, there are some rooms where you can't move or shoot. You just have to stand there and wait until the mosters kill you so you can start over.\n\nJumping is a nightmare. It's nearly impossible to jump from one thing to another. If you end up in a room where you need to jump, then you might as well die and start over.\n\nIf you enjoy dying, then this game is for you.","April 29","false","5.2"," 0 of 16 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","16","0","1"

After being a middling shovelware developer for the Xbox 360 for several years, they have created a very tight, very well crafted roguelike FPS with some genuine challenge and enough unlockable material to keep most players occupied for quite a while. On top of that, at the time of writing, MIlkstone is still consistently adding content to the game including weapons, bosses, and new character perks.\n\nMy only real criticisms are that the game is a bit short--the titular ZIggurat can be completed fairly easily so long as you have the controls down and pick appropriate perks--and some of the various magical weapons are demonstrably better than others--the balance isn't quite perfect.\n\nOther than that, highly recommended.

Atop this it manages to massively improve on roguelite concepts by giving you choices in character leveling by letting you choose between a pair of random perks with each level. While the game contains perma death, each time you die or progress further you will unlock new equipment.\nOverall this is hands down the greatest game to reach an official release this year, being almost glitch free and containing mountains of content, it is an absolute MUST PLAY for ANY rogue-lite, RPG or FPS fan.

It has very high replay value. The game is suprisingly short, but the unlockable perks and characters keep the game entertaining. There is a good amount of enemy variety with each enemy having a different way to fight. There is a difficulty bar so new players can actually see multiple levels of this game without getting destroyed in the first room, and hard mode provides experienced players a challenge. Though you don't see everything. I still see new room conditions, buffs, handicaps, and bosses.\nAlthough you can get unlucky with the alters, but if you are skilled then you can overcome the handicaps. Although often the random perks may sometimes seem unlucky, I've never encountered a situation where the game feels unwinable, there is always a build I can create that is viable, even if it is something that I wouldn't have pre planned. In a way I really like that, because it forces the player to analyze the perks they are given and the perks they have in order to create an effective mage.\nMany would say that the perks you aquire through playing are giving advantages to the players who have more experience. I would say this is partially true, many of the weapons and perks you unlocke are very strong, but also there are more possibilities to deal with. After going through the ziggurat about 14 times, I've found that my characters haven't gotten much stronger, just more creative.\nAll and All, this is an amazing game and I think more people should try it.","January 29, 2015","true","17.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Normally I don't get hyped with FPS, but this one really hits the spot with its beautiful, clear graphics and an ammunition system that is highly accessible.  Ziggurat's gameplay focuses on understanding what the enemies do and figure out how to effectively destroy them with your current build and the room setup, which are random because of rogue-like elements.\nBut where this game really triumphs is its clarity.  I can always tell what the enemy does and what my weapons do, letting me focus on my strategies.  Each upgrade as well gives you a clear sense of direction of how you are getting more powerful.  I have never confused one thing with another in this game.\nAnother worth-mention is the controls.  It is smooth.  After a few games I don't even remember that I am holding a controller as I play.  There is no mechanic that stopped me from performing actions such as moving, shooting, and checking my status.\nI highly recommend this game.

When leveling up your health and mana pools are increased slightly and are given a choice between two perks, they can be both beneficial and decrimental.\n\nThe game has a cartoony style that is actually refreshing, and many destructible envinroments, some rooms are also ridden with traps.\n\nAll in all, a very light-hearted, entertaining, casual game, for when you have to blast stuff away and have a good time with a moderate challenge.","January 23, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What can be said of this game?  It is VERY polished in it's visuals, art direction, and scoring.  The landscapes can be alittle overwhelming at time and setting your FOV to at least 95 is a must or you will likely be overcome in the swarm of ravenous, power A.I.-driven creatures in the Ziguarat.  Some would call Ziggurat UNFORGIVING, and they would be correct: death is, for the most part, permanent and you will lose all previous spoils after failing no matter how many levels you have descended.  The frequency of death, I find can be attributed to an abbundance of enemies that must be defeated in a circle strafe fashion with little to no cover to be seen.

The production values are significantly higher than any other indie roguelight fps such as tower of guns, Paranautical activity and RogueShooter (which are all great games in their own right).\n\nThe magical setting, with fantasy enemies and wands and spells in place of guns makes for a nice change and works surprisingly well with the quakelike gameplay.\nThe aforementioned 'quakelike' gameplay is fast paced and feels good, shooting (or casting spells more like) and jumping all feel smoothe and accurate.\nWhat I will say is it's a little dissapointingly easy, at least on the 'normal' setting, This is the first roguelight I beat on my very first try. But with more difficulty settings and MANY unlocks to go, there's plenty of replay value and reasons to come back. Unlocks include new perks, weapons, useable items and even characters.\n\nThe roguelike/roguelight FPS genre is very varied and so far, every game has enough originality to justify it's existance, Ziggurat is no exception.

Except you're doing it with magic/alchemical devices from a first person perspective.\n\nIt doesn't really do a whole lot new- you do level up and are allowed to choose perks to help you out in various ways. There's four different weapon types- your wand, a spell book, a staff, and an alchemical device. Each have their own mana pool, which is quite unique- only problem is all of these weapons perform basically the same- shoot some number of bolts in some pattern, with an alternate fire that just fires more bolts. Bosses are okay- mostly they just shoot stuff at you and summon monsters, nothing really ingenious. No two playthroughs are the same, but multiple playthoughs aren't really substantially different, either.\n\nThis game could've been great, but it's not. Don't get me wrong- it's still fun. It's something to play if you don't know what else to play. I love the Hexen/Heretic vibe it has going on, and it's certainly worth getting if it's on a Steam sale, but the $15 asking price is a bit too steep for what you get out of it.","January 25, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Certainly the comparison is there, but the random factor of this game makes it a much more compelling experience. The reason is that, in the hoary titles of my youth, I would often Learn my way through a level. I would die, reload, proceed a bit further, die, then reload again, and by the end of a level I would have it memorized.\n\nIn Ziggurat, the randomization completely negates this. It is like being in Heretic/Hexen heaven, each new level is completely different experience. This is helped greatly by the variety of monsters that are sent against you, and the need to constantly adjust tactics to the new environment/monster-combinations.\n\nAll of this, and when I finally managed to beat the boss, I found whole new monsters on level 2! Brilliant!\n\nI think that eventually, I will reach the end of what the games algorithm can throw at me, but I know that by then I will have more than gotten my money's worth of entertainment out of Ziggurat, so I am content.\n","October 31, 2014","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nebucadnezar/recommended/308420/","nebucadnezar","DIO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nebucadnezar/","254 products in account","Ziggurat follows the somewhat recent trend of Rogue-Lite games, that is to say it borrows from and is heavily influenced by the Roguelike genre but still differs in quite a few aspects. You could also describe Ziggurat as a first-person dungeon shooter, yes that's right: Ziggurat puts your 420 noscope skills to the test, while retaining RPG and Roguelike elements. This might sound like a clumsy mix at first but the overall flow of the game is actually very pleasant and the genres blend quite a bit better than some might have expected.\n\nYou start of at the first level of a (somewhat) randomly generated dungeon with a wand and a secondary weapon, which is randomly chosen from one of the three categories: spells, staffs and alchemy. You can only carry one weapon of each category, your wand is permanently tied to your character and can not be swapped. Each weapon category, including the wand, has it's own mana pool - while the wand's pool automatically regenerates over time, you have to manually re-fill the other pools via item drops from monsters, which also drop EXP gems. Each time you level up, you get prompted with two random perks, one of which you can chose and thus upgrade your characters. As is common in this genre, many perks have their drawbacks or revolve around sheer luck - so be careful what you choose. Each level of the dungeon features a set of rooms, each with a different event, e.g.: monsters, items, traps etc. A (random) boss awaits you at the end of each dungeon level up to level 5, which features the end-boss.\n\nThe game's graphics and soundtrack serve their purpose well enough, they're not outstanding in any way but that should not be held against an indie game. The monster design is also nothing groundbreaking - while they feature quite an array of gameplay mechanics, their design is relatively bland and uninspired. I will not go into technical details; it should suffice to say the game runs absolutely flawless for me. As you might expect from this genre, Ziggurat has an immense replay-value, with tons of achievements, leaderboards, unlockables (including weapons, perks and characters) and three difficulties for you to explore. It is also worth noting that this game has received regular, free, content updates and fixes up to this point - it's always nice when a developer cares.\n\nAll-in-all, if the concept of a first person dungeon shooter sounds interesting to you, which it quite frankly should, I will definitely recommend Ziggurat. It is fast-paced, varied, challenging and certainly worth it's asking price.","January 30, 2015","true","32.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game obviously takes a lot of influence from games like heretic and DOOM. If that doesn't mean anything to you, DOOM and Heeretic were basically two games that defined the fps genre (evidenced by the term "doom clone"). Additionally, it is immediately recognizeable that this game is tough. I died on the first room for my first couple of runs. After a couple of hours I finally beat the game on normal mode. This achievement holds significant weight and the feeling of accomplishment up to this point is amazing. In addition to beating the game, this feeling of accomplishment is tied to unlocking new perks (which are upgrades you can use upon leveling up) and weapons (should be self explanatory unless your an idiot).\nCons:\nI believe this game suffers from two main problems. For me, a roguelike should reward you as you play and get better. However, when rewards occur too quickly it can not only be overwhelming but also it can diminish the feeling of accomplishment. This is the first problem I believe the game suffers. After beating the game that coveted first time, I began to unlock up to seven things per run. While not necessarily bad, I found it a bit ridiculous when I started experimenting with what I could unlock with horrible runs. At the worst of it I unlocked five things without killing an enemy. The second problem with this game is that the gameplay has no variation. Allow me to explain. There is no duobt that this game contains amazing fps bullet hell gameplay that changes as you unlock more perks and weapons. However, other than those two things, the game doesn't change. The new weapons and perks change up the style of gameplay, but the core mechanic remains the same. Shoot. Kill. Advance. Additionally, the changing interior of the environments and weapons begins to lose its luster after you realize that all of the rooms and enemies are just cookie cutter copies of each other rearranged on the beginning of each level.\nSummary:\nThis game has truly amazing gameplay heavily based on the frantic fps Hectic and DOOM. The initial feeling of accomplishment for getting better at the unforgiving gameplay is very satisfying. However, the lack of variation and overuse of rewards eventually undermines the the feeling of accomplishment  that makes this game great. Overall, I believe this game is still very good and is definitely still worth a buy, but for the reasons stated above won't be a roguelike that I will be able to seriously commit some time to.\nExtra: For other roguelikes that I believe are better suited for some serious commitment, I recommend: Risk of Rain, Nuclear Throne, Magicite, and Tower of Guns.","January 30, 2015","false","87.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Adds a little bit of character to the feel of the tower as your traverse through its dangerous halls and rooms.\n\nGameplay/Challenge (9.5/10):\nZiggurat deffinitely does not pull any punches when it comes to challenge. The random layouts to each floor gives a unique gameplay each time you start a new game along with the randomness of the weapons you find through out the game. Each battle room gives a unique challenge as well with some rooms giving you a random modifier during the fights. Some rooms become even more challenging from reducing the amount of damage you do with specific weapons to increasing the amount of damage the mobs do.\n\nBoss fights for each floor can be quite a challenge, especially when you don't have the right weapons or skills fromt he random perk you pick when you level up.\n\nReplay Value (10/10):\nAs I said before, each time you start a new game, it is a different experience. As you lay through the game you unlock more perks, weapons and can unlock more characters with different skill weaknesses and strenghs. You will play through the game several times before you have the right perks and weapons to complete the game. But the challenge doesn't end there, once you complete the game with one character you unlock the ability to challenge the endless dungeon mode with that character.\n\nOverall Score (9.5/10):\nOverall, if you make one purchase for a random dungeon FPS, this game is well worth the money with the endless replay value and challenge through out. I recommend this game for anyone looking for a cheap game with a high challenge and replay value.","January 4, 2015","true","23.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Normally I don't get hyped with FPS, but this one really hits the spot with its beautiful, clear graphics and an ammunition system that is highly accessible.  Ziggurat's gameplay focuses on understanding what the enemies do and figure out how to effectively destroy them with your current build and the room setup, which are random because of rogue-like elements.\nBut where this game really triumphs is its clarity.  I can always tell what the enemy does and what my weapons do, letting me focus on my strategies.  Each upgrade as well gives you a clear sense of direction of how you are getting more powerful.  I have never confused one thing with another in this game.\nAnother worth-mention is the controls.  It is smooth.  After a few games I don't even remember that I am holding a controller as I play.  There is no mechanic that stopped me from performing actions such as moving, shooting, and checking my status.\nI highly recommend this game.  For a small title this game has incredible level of polish.  I hope the devs make more games.","January 22, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game reminds me greatly of Heretic and Hexxen, specifically the weapons, they bare close resemblance to Heretic's weapon, im pretty sure the devs designed the game with this in mind.\n\nYou are a mage apprentice on your way to your "graduation challenge" you have to brave the insides of Ziggurat, an ever-changing dimensional dungeon that is host to many horrors, and come out alive on the other end so you can be a fully fledged mage. The game has many enemies (one of which remind me of Doom's lost souls, and im pretty sure the devs made them with exactly that in mind) also lots of weapons (to which you can carry 4 at a time), you can also pick up amulets that grants you a power upon activation for a time, then you have to let them recharge; you can carry only one of these at any one given time. When leveling up your health and mana pools are increased slightly and are given a choice between two perks, they can be both beneficial and decrimental.\n\nThe game has a cartoony style that is actually refreshing, and many destructible envinroments, some rooms are also ridden with traps.\n\nAll in all, a very light-hearted, entertaining, casual game, for when you have to blast stuff away and have a good time with a moderate challenge.","January 23, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The devil though is in the details.  The first time I ran through on Easy, as the Apprentice character I was like 'Cool, like an updated Heretic.'  Perks were nice, the weapons well-designed, the levels were interesting, with the occasional modifier keeping them from getting too monotonous...  then I died...\n\nAnd I unlocked about 6 more items... Next go through, got a bit deeper, died, unlocked about 8 more items, including a new weapon.  Played through again, died near the end, unlocked another 8 or 9 items...\n\nThe further you go, the more you unlock, the more you unlock the deeper the gameplay, the deeper the gameplay the further you'll go.\n\nIt's the details, the literally dozens, over a hundred unlockables, the various classes which tweak the gameplay, the variances in the various randomized weapons.  The need to modify your play-style based on the randomness of your drops, the spawns, and your perks.  It's what made the original ASCII rogue so cool, yes each game was a new experience, but the randomness ensured it was practically A WHOLE new experience,  Pleasurable replayability isn't just a cool feature, it's an absolute necessity in this game.\n\nNot too many 'Cons' here - bosses could be a little more unique, Cephus is pretty much the only one that truly feels like a boss, all the others just feel like Ultra-Rare Elites of regular mobs (though Audrey is fun too).  My only other complaint would be some form of cooperative multiplayer... or even a massive deathmatch where you're not just competing against the monsters but each other.  Only 1-life each, if you die you have to wait until someone exits the level and 'wins' that round.  Sure the 'King of the Hill' would be higher level than everyone as when you die you go back to level one, but that would just encourage everyone else to do a little 'head-hunting.'  Just a thought that would make the game more interesting, though straight-deathmatch in randomized dungeons, team deathmatch, and regular coop (with scaling enemies Serious Sam-style) would also be awesome.\n\nAgain asking for MP in what is essentially a single player game may be nit-picking in the extreme, but this game is so well-made otherwise, it's tough to find any other faults.\n\nA+++ rating.

It's the typical carrot on a stick, and it's midly maddening. Thankfully you can kill that damned carrot...literally. You will die, and you will do it often.

Altogether fun...but random, and there's the segway for my gripe.\n\n1st 4 times I played the game I died inside of 2 rooms. The 5th time I beat the game and barely got a scratch. I've since played/died 50 times (just got the ach) and have gotten above the 2nd floor maybe 4 times. Everything about this game is random, which is cool, if I didn't constantly see the same items and upgrades ad nauseum.\n\nIt really feels like items and gear are not only random, but have Common, uncommon, and "you'll never see this" flags on the random generation. I've gotten an amulet 4 times: 3 of those times, it was the same amulet. Same with spells...fire or frost, although I have about 5 of them unlocked. Same with stavess and upgrades...oh don't get me started about upgrades...I get some of the same ones over and over, even within one game.\n\nThis kills it being randomly generated for me. The game is fun, and its not like a ton is invested to each game, so after 2-5 games I can rage quit and pick it up later, secretly hoping to see something new, and almost always walking away dissapointed. If this is the case, I really hope they fix the lack of randomness. If its just me, then not only am I unlucky, but I guess I'm a whiney baby aswell. I can't hate too much though as I'll still go try to kick the football again. and again, then maybe one more time, but that's it - I swear.\n\nHelpful tip: If the zoom-when-fire annoys you as much as it did me, remove it from the mouse keybindings. As default mouse 1 is bound to fire AND zoom, so unbind zoom and then you won't feel like a 90 year old squinting every time you want to unload on an enemy.","March 24, 2015","true","41.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What can be said of this game?  It is VERY polished in it's visuals, art direction, and scoring.  The landscapes can be alittle overwhelming at time and setting your FOV to at least 95 is a must or you will likely be overcome in the swarm of ravenous, power A.I.-driven creatures in the Ziguarat.  Some would call Ziggurat UNFORGIVING, and they would be correct: death is, for the most part, permanent and you will lose all previous spoils after failing no matter how many levels you have descended.  The frequency of death, I find can be attributed to an abbundance of enemies that must be defeated in a circle strafe fashion with little to no cover to be seen.  What may come across as poor design to some will be a worthwile experience to any dungeon crawler, rogue-like fan (like myself).  I recommend but only if that sounds like something you're in to.","January 23, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After being a middling shovelware developer for the Xbox 360 for several years, they have created a very tight, very well crafted roguelike FPS with some genuine challenge and enough unlockable material to keep most players occupied for quite a while. On top of that, at the time of writing, MIlkstone is still consistently adding content to the game including weapons, bosses, and new character perks.\n\nMy only real criticisms are that the game is a bit short--the titular ZIggurat can be completed fairly easily so long as you have the controls down and pick appropriate perks--and some of the various magical weapons are demonstrably better than others--the balance isn't quite perfect.\n\nOther than that, highly recommended.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/redwolf29/recommended/308420/","redwolf29","RedWolf_29","http://steamcommunity.com/id/redwolf29/","145 products in account","What's it about?\nZiggurat is a first person shooter Rougelite. You make your way through randomly generated dungeons, using magical weaponary to fight hordes of enemies and gain experience to increase your level and power up your skills in order to defeat the final boss at the end. Think The Binding of Isaac crossed with Doom and you're pretty much there.\n\nHow does it play?\nIf you have played any Rougelites like The Binding of Isaac or Tower of Guns then you should know what to expect. Dungeons, rooms, items and enemies are all randomly generated, keeping the genre's infamous RNG element that can carry you through to the end or completely screw you over and everything in between.\n\nLike Tower of Guns or Paranautical Activity, Ziggurat's combat is built in an FPS format. Unlike many games of its ilk, however, Ziggurat's combat is incredibly robust. The weapons all feel different enough to warrant experimentation throughout runs, while they are still meaty enough that you rarely feel cheated through being given a shoddy weapon. Every weapon has both a standard attack and an alt-fire, essentially doubling your means of attack. Alt-fire tends to expend more mana, which acts like ammo in other FPS games and can be replenished by picking up coloured crystals of each weapon class's respective colour. You unlock more stuff as you play, including new characters, so repeat playthroughs are highly encouraged.\n\nMovement in Ziggurat is very fast and fluid, harkening back to the PC shooters of old, so you feel very agile as you dance and weave amongst your enemies, firing off spells left, right and centre. The feeling of speed, the crunchiness of the combat and the gorgeous lighting effects make for a game that is very exciting to play. Even in runs where you don't make it past the second level, you feel powerful and capable of taking on the world. Until you get stomped by one of the tough-as-nails bosses.\n\nHow does it look?\nZiggurat is a gorgeous-looking game. It's semi-cartoony aesthetic and gorgeous lighting effects are very pleasing to the eye, and allow absolute clarity for spotting enemies and lining up your shots. Enemies are also refreshingly varied, ranging from sword-throwing skeletons to acid-spitting slimes and screeching banshees. It also runs very smoothly, even with a lot of enemies onscreen (a regular occurance); Milkstone did a stellar job of optimising their game.\n\nHow does it sound?\nThe sound design is respectable at best. The music consists of generic loops and enemy sounds are repeated quite frequently. The weapons and spells sound good enough, but the sound design is overall rather unremarkable.\n\nLong story short\nZiggurat is an excellent game. It's pure balls-to-the-wall fun that surpasses its contemporaries in terms of its combat and is lovely to look at to boot. The controls are tight and responsive, the weapons are great fun to use, and it is balanced in such a way that you are rarely screwed over. The old Rougelite RNG can still stick a spanner in the works of an otherwise good run, so you ought to consider your opinion on this element before making a purchase. If high-octane, spell-casting action is what you're after though, Ziggurat is the game I would recommend first.","October 26, 2014","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nothing's more satisfying than zapping kobolds with a Tesla coil or killing slimes that look more like Pac-Man ghosts with porcupine bombs.  Being a rogue-lite, expect just about everything that is just about everything to be randomized, in the style of games like Binding of Issac.  It also caters towards fans of oldschool FPSes like DOOM and Heretic, where the only way to win is kill everything in sight and make sure you're still alive at the end.

Your trusty wand the only surefire weapon that you have, and even that needs to recharge. Running in circles to avoid the flames coming at you is all just part of the fun of this title. The difficulty is hard at times but rewarding.\n\nYou unlock new characters as you progress such as Kraz the Novice or Algorab the alchemist. All unlocked characters have different attributes and skills than the initial Argo the Apprentice that you start with. Unlocking these different characters is simply achieved by playing the game and earning different rewards.\n\nOverall I have rated this title an 9.5/10 although its difficulty can be rewarding it can also be overwhelming at times.

I knew it was a first person Rouge-like and that was about it. The thing I did not expect going into the game that really hooked me was the speed of the gameplay. Imagine Quake and you have an idea of the speed I am talking about. Ziggurat is much more a FPS with Rogue-like elements thrown in. On of the tags on the Steam page is Rogue-LITE, which I didn't know was a term, but fits this perfectly. There are just enough mechanics from games like Binding of Isaac thrown in without it getting too carried away. In one sense I miss that, but with the fast twitch shooter gameplay of Ziggurat it fits quite well.\n\nThe game is not perfect, enemy variety, and overall polish could be improved. The learning curve is steep as well, and I actually had to turn the difficulty down to make any sort of progress. Overall it is a fun game that combines genres in a way that I have not seen done before and I highly recommend it.","February 25, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Many of the weapons will probably make you feel right at home with similar feeling to guns from other games.\nShotguns? Spray excessive amounts of fire, or freeze your opposition with shards.\nRockets? Volcanic cannons and homing spooky skulls.\nRapid fire guns? In several different flavors of staves.\nAerial superiority weapons? Throw a companion cube.\nIf I missed something, you'll probably find something similar, or at least another weapon cozy enough to fill the void.\n\nHands down, this is one of my favorite games. It's reminiscent of old games, tickles a particular fancy I was never able to satisfy beforehand, and this time I was able to git gud before the game was at least twenty years old.\n\n10/10, not even a joke.\nI absolutely love this game, and $15 is a steal.","March 13, 2015","true","99.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every level you gain your choice of a perk, chosen from between a random selection of two perks. These perks can radically effect play, and a choice that doesn't synergize well with your playstyle may spell your doom, or radically empower you. The incredibly disfunctional or amazing builds that emerge from this system make continued runs through the Ziggurat feel very different, giving some nice legs to a game that technically speaking, has only a moderate amount of content.\n\nNew weapons, perks, and characters are unlocked simply by playing, and even a very poor run will likely yield a few new perks and a weapon. This system rewards persistence as well as skill, even if you can't make it to the last floor your attempts may pave the way for an eventual success, making the game less hopelessly frustrating than most games with rogue-like elements.\n\nVery fun, stylish, and competently put together, Ziggurat has a lot to love for a very reasonable price.","March 6, 2015","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it has a certain genius to it, and at the moment stands as a masterpiece of game design, and a personal favorite of mine.\n\nHere are some important points I have to make:\n- The game requires a large number of playthroughs.  Not just to get the hang of the flow of combat, but also to learn the enemy/weapon relationships.  Because you start with a small pool of weapons initially, this makes it pretty simple to do, and cuts down the overwhelming nature of the roguelike elements.  You'll die a lot initially, but you will immediately find nourishment in your demise as slowly the game unfolds itself, like a puzzle box.\n- As the game begins to develop during your playthroughs, you will notice that the strategies to combat will take on a depth.  With the limited amount of health and other manas besides the wand itself you will find a certain triumph the moment you uncover the manners in which combat can be controlled and your advantage maintained.  The second this happens to you you will immediately feel like a bada**.\n- Each playthrough increases in complexity to the point that you will relish the opportunity to play to floor 5, knowing that when you die, several things will be unlocked, making the next run even more random.  Not to mention that you might get to the end.\n\nTL;DR: The game hits its stride several playthroughs in, making a $15 price tag a bargain.  It may have near inifinite replayability, since the pool of available items and weapons when everything is unlocked is a virtual playground of roguelike greatness.","February 17, 2015","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's got tight controls and you never feel like there's anyone but yourself to blame if you die, as every roguelike should be. It's just a perfect blend of solo arena FPS with roguelike procedural map generation and permadeath. Good stuff. Not as good for spectators as some of the other roguelikes out there, but it's great to play.","February 14, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Grapgics are awesome, combat is crazy and when things get intense, you're o the edge of your seat.\n\nGraphics - 8/10\nGameplay - 9/10 (If you like action packed dungeon crawlers)\nSound- 8/10\nStory - 5/10 (Lacks much of a story but trust me, thats okay)","February 15, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
