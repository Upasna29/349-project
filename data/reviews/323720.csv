Well, it's more like a mixture of Myst meets Resident Evil. It definitely plays like a classic, has a decent sountrack and the story is interesting. You play as an addict who is fighting his addiction. He takes medication one night and goes to bed only to find he is trapped in a nightmare he can not wake from.\n\nVisually, the game is in 3D, but is static, similar to the way Shadowgate is. There are some good moments where the music and the atmosphere really come together to give you an immersive horror experience. All in all, it isn't a bad game.","October 27, 2015","true","2.9"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","29","31","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/323720/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Back when Flash first became a thing, there were a few websites that had little "adventure" games where you clicked on hotspots in heavily Photoshopped images to move through creepy scenes. It should surprise absolutely no one that they never stopped making those, and in fact started rammming them through Greenlight. I can only assume that's where Decay: The Mare came from, because not a whole lot of thought went into anything beyond the stitching of random scenes together.\n\nYou play some depressed kid at a clinic in New Jersey, which basically guarantees you're never going to recover from whatever's got you down. Wandering around at night, you end up in some nightmare series of decrepit hallways that you have to escape because... maybe it represents your depression? I beat the damn thing and I'm still not sure. Like I said, it's all static scenes linked by arrows at the edges of the screen, with no animations between them. Some of the transitions make sense, but others are so disjointed you'll have trouble figuring out where you just came from. That's a problem since the game is VERY heavy on backtracking, and there's little aesthetic consistency from room to room, or sometimes wall to wall.\n\nEach scene might have one or MAYBE two interactables to fool with, either items to collect or puzzle boxes to open. The developers LOVE number pads, so get ready for plenty of four-digit codes (one hidden behind possibly the STUPIDEST puzzle I have ever seen). Aside from that there's basically nothing to examine, and no notes or files to collect. Oh, there are little collectable coins scattered throughout that unlock "extras", but they blend into the background and only help if you collect every single one, so eff that. For the most part, the scenes you navigate are devoid of interesting features and start to blend together very quickly.\n\nThe one thing you can look forward to are the infrequent and seemingly random jumpscares the developers decided to throw in. There's some corpse-looking thing in the area, and it likes to bang on windows and scamper past lights at just the right time to make you jump. This thing is never really addressed in the story, which is just as well because the story is stupid as all hell. There's a big twist to it, and some of the spooky bits get tied in, but most of the weirdness in the game goes unexplained, I guess just written off as you being crazypants. I found out the hard way that there are two endings, because I did the thing the game suggested I do and got the bad version.\n\nI usually don't like to rag on games too hard, but Decay is just a really dumb game. The gameplay is thin, the environments are low-effort, the puzzles are dead simple except when they're overly complicated, and the story is garbage. I powered through all three episodes in about an hour and a half, but after the first twenty minutes or so I desperately wanted to be doing something more meaningful with my time. There are a few sparks of brilliance buried in there that helped keep me going, I admit. The camera in the second episode makes for some pretty interesting sequences, but that's one decent bit out of 90 minutes. If you're looking for a clever, challenging, or interesting adventure, don't look for it here.","October 23, 2015","false","1.7"," 47 of 65 people (72%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","72","47","65","11","0"

Even though it is a point and click, you will still feel this underlying feeling of terror as the game slowly reveals what's happening piece by piece.  If you just want to dip your toes into the genre this is a great place to start. I'd give it a 7/10.\n------------------------------------------------\n\nIf its on sale or you have cash that you feel like spending, grab it for sure. If you only have a $10 net worth, you could probably find better uses for that money.\n\nThey got the puzzle aspect right in this one. While most games haphazardly throw together 'puzzles' in the form of "move the blocks in order", this game actually involves more thinking than most. They aren't that difficult, but will provide some satisfaction when you figure them out. A great thing I found with the puzzles is that they aren't frustrating in anyway, so you won't mind taking the time to solve them.\n\nThe worst thing I can say about this is that the navigation is rough, your character turns,flips,and cartwheels all over the place and it can leave you disoriented. After I figure out where I need to go, I have to rely heavily on the "hint" button to point me to the correct doors; otherwise I'd end up going in a several circles.\n\nI haven't beaten it yet when I'm writing this, but I'm definitely excited (and hesitant :p) to get back into it to reveal more of the story. I picked this up looking for something to do youtube videos on, and it has delivered.\n(**Plus the publishers were more than willing to let me record and monetize let's plays after I EMAILED THEM FIRST.)","May 18, 2015","true","1.9"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","18","22","0","0"

One night you take your usual meds and that's when things get weird. You are some how put into a slightly different world, where you will have to survive the night. Can you fin your way through, solve the puzzles, figure out the clues, or will you disappear, it is totally up to you.\n\nIn Decay - The Mare, developed by Shining Game Software, you are going to get to do just that. In this 3 episodes in one game you are going to have to solve the puzzles that block your path, and of course survive. Now there is no way of actually dying in the game, but there are a couple of jumpy moments that will make you wonder what will come next.\n\nThis is an interesting point click adventure game in which you are going to be interacting with rooms that a specific camera angle, and at times you will get to see different angles. This is actually one of the strange things about the game, its not that they have specific views of a room that you get to work with, its the fact that no matter how many exits to a room there are, and the views you have, you will always default to the first view of the room you see. This does make for a frustrating couple of minutes when you are trying to quickly move around an area, through different rooms, and you have to remember that you might automatically default to the view of the door that you just came through, instead of the view of the door that is defaultly behind you.\n\nAnother odd thing about this game is the episodes/chapters/whatever you want to call them. At the end of each one you're going to get credits, then you will be thrown to a chapter select which of course will take you back in game. You will then have to repeat the last set of actions you took right before the end of the last chapter to start the new one you are in.\n\nTo continue with the odd things about this game is that the second, or middle chapter, probably has the most to it. You are going to gain the use of a camera, a mechanic I really liked, to see what is hidden to the naked eye. There's also a slew of challenging puzzles in this chapter. The strange thing is that all of those mechanics disappear for the final chapter and you go back to the almost random clicking to figure out what to do next mode that I found myself falling back into from the first chapter.\n\nThe graphics for this game are not going to blow you away, but there is something about it that definitely gave me the vibe I was expecting to see in the game. That being said the inventory look was not my favorite. You are presented with a line of squares, each with an item on it and you have to basically move the squares until the item in the box you want is in the middle of the screen so that you can select it. I don't really understand why they couldn't just allow for more of a show all the squares on the screen in a different pattern look, and allow you to move the selection to the item you want to use, yes I know that the selection square allowed you a couple of options for the item, but you could have figured something slightly different to allow for that functionality (view, use, combine) to still be intuitive.\n\nI am VERY confused by the voice acting in this game, there are times where you get a voice and other times where you're left wondering if someone is going to read the text on the screen, and you just end up voicing it yourself to keep the mood going. That to me felt sloppy, I've always been a firm believer in the all or nothing, preferrably all voiced, way of doing things.\n\nSo I guess we should talk about if you should check out this game, well the answer is yes, I still enjoyed the 2 and a half hours of gameplay it game me, and sure there were some strange things that I wish were done better. Is this a must have, by no means is it, but it is definitely something you should at the very least check out and see. It isn't for everyone, it doesn't feel completely polished, but it gets the job done.

Full disclosure, I did use a guide for this game. It's easy to get lost in this type of point & click adventure, where you are able to turn a full 360 degrees in many rooms.\n\nIt's hard to be scared of a point & click game, no matter how hard the developers try. However, the use of dramatic lighting and subtle, creepy atmosphere will really put the gamer in the mood and mind set to be scared. Decay starts out promisingly enough during Episode 1, which is by far the most disturbing of the three episodes available. However, Episodes 2 and 3 take on plot twists that cause the first episode to be pointless so far as the story is concerned.\n\nEach episode lasts roughly an hour, depending on how good you are at point & click style games or if you're using a guide or the in-game hint system. Unfortunately, the game loses its luster near the end of Episode 2; an episode which is slightly comparable to the effective scare tactics of Episode 1. However, by Episode 3, Decay has lost all sense of what it originally set out to accomplish and resorts to cheap jump scares to give the player a cheap thrill.\n\nDecay: The Mare is a decent enough point & click style game, with a great opening and disappointing ending. I wouldn't suggest purchasing it at the full price, but it appears in bundles and on sale quite often, so pick it up then and stash it back for a slow, rainy day when you're home alone.

He lost everything and started his career as a junkie. The drug treatment center "Reaching Dreams" seems to be his last chance to get rid of his drug problems, but what starts out as the last hope for Sam changes immediately into a nightmarish unbalance between dream and reality. Not only that everything in the treatment center changed to the worst, something or someone seems to be following Sam's steps. Does it want help? Does it want to harm? A gruesome journey through a sureal world begins and Sam shouldn't always believe things at the first sight...\n\nLike in every other point'n'click game you have to find specific items, combine them to open another way and solve riddles. However, the riddles in Decay: The Mare are well-made but not very challenging. This makes the way through the 3 different episodes easy and you won't need a walkthrough. If you still get stuck at one point you are always be able to use the interrogation mark at the very left bottom corner. It will show you the correct way with a small hint that something might still be hidden in the room you are in.\n\nThe story itself is very thrilling coupled with a few scares which might make you jump. You always feel like somebody follows your steps and something couldhappen while gruesome pictures are looking at you.\nWhile the graphics are hold in darkish colours, the surreal environment gives this game a special creepy factor.\n\nThere is no real music in the background while you are playing. Only your footsteps, some tones and the sounds of the surrounding are your continual companions. However, this doesn't harm the atmosphere in any way.\n\n▐▐░░▒▒▓▓ The lesson is clear ▓▓▒▒░░▐▐\n\nThis is a gem for all lovers of the point'n'click genre out there. As I wrote at the beginning, nothing fits better into a point'n'click than the mechanics of horror to riveted by this genre.

For a 2015 game, the artwork could have been better and more detailed. It looks like a game from 1995, we don't need that today.\n\nThe puzzles are ok but most of the time you will have to roam around until a scripted event triggers, and you can't know such thing is going to randomly (actually scripted) happen, like doors unlocking themselves after a cutscene for no reason or new items popping up only because you go to a room already visited in the past and the thing comes out of nowhere. There is no logic in that and is not a good way to make the progressing in the game harder.\n\nThe atmosphere is cool but once you get a grasp of the story, you notice how empty and obvious it is.\n\nCan't believe it's a 10 euros game. I think I bought it for 1 euro or so, and I still almost regret it.\n\nThere are much better or more entertaining point and click puzzle games and adventure games out there, I see no reason to recommend this one, even because it is highly overpriced (low budget game, cheap soundtrack, no voice acting almost at all). If there were a neutral rating I may agree with choosing one, but this time I will go with a thumbs down, because surely I doubt this would deserve a thumbs up.","September 9, 2015","false","4.3"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","0"

But I believe that for this game,it really works !! I personally love P&C games,they are the first type of games I played when I left the world of HOGs and started looking for a more involved genre of games to play !! Just like P&C mystery games,this game has a nice flow,so far. . . .\n\nIt seems to me to have all the ambience of a decently made horror game,you feel creeped out being in this seemingly abandoned rehab hospital. . . I like the subject of the game too,going through treatment for drug abuse,it's a bold subject and could have been taken the wrong way by the audience and could have offended A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE !!\nI,for one,think it's an outstanding subject and I believe that there is SO MUCH that can be done with this subject matter and I'm hoping to see way more ideas about it in the future !!\n\nO.K.,about the game itself,it's a fairly standard point and click mystery/horror game. I think the surroundings are pretty creepy,the music lends itself to the feeling of dread,it's very unobtrusive but at the same time,it's always there,in the background,quietly sending out creepy vibes !!\n\nThere is plenty to do here and plenty of places to go and doors to enter. . .I've only come across 2 mini games so far and they were pretty straightforward P&C puzzles,if you take your time and observe your surroundings you'll find the answers to the puzzles,but you do have to be diligent and pay attention-you never know what is a clue and what's put there to throw you off the scent !! I think thats one of the things I look for in this genre,I want the answers to be in the gameplay,I don't want them to be so obscure I have to resort to a walkthrough,thats not a fun game,thats a crappy made game and those are the games I delete right away !! One thing I often do with games is I take notes !! Yes,take actual handwritten notes,that I can refer back to and use in case I get stuck and am not sure what to do !\n\nYou have an inventory,accessable by the I key on the keyboard,while in the inventory you have the ability to look at everything you've collected,you can turn things around and look at the backs of things,I suggest you should do that,if they give you that option,they do it for a reason and I believe you should take full advantage it. You also have a "combine" ability while in your inventory,as with the examine ability,I believe they give us this for a reason and it's never hurt anybody to try every insane combo you can !! You never know what will work together and what will not,unless you experiment around with your items !!\n\nI'm gonna slide back in game now,I'll repost in this review as I progress deeper in game. . .\n","June 21, 2015","true","7.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Dealing with mature themes such as bereavement and suicide, it was an involving point-and-click horror adventure with a powerful soundtrack and atmosphere to spare. After much anticipation (and an almost-cancellation after the second episode), the sequel is here. Rather than continue the story of the first game, Decay: The Mare casts you as Sam, a recovering drug addict haunted by nightmares.\n\nI'll get the bad out of the way first. The game is short- shorter than the first- and has less endings. I also realize that the price is turning people off- yeah, well I bought Episode 1 and 2 twice on XBOX Live and can't say I was thrilled to have to buy them again on Steam...\n\nBut the aching sense of dread and powerful soundtrack is back in full force- and it's also scarier than the first game, which says a lot.  You'll get through this in a few hours, but you'll play again to find all the coins and unlock gruesome artwork and more.

Your character is a psychiatric patient who thinks he's woken up during the night  but then finds he is in a medicine induced nightmare that he can't seem to escape. The gameplay consists of single clicks to move around, open doors, pick up objects and solve puzzles.\n\nThe people who will like this game are those who really like sudden scares. The game is full of doors slamming shut in your face, shadowy figures running on the periphery of your vision, objects being thrown at you by invisible forces... that sort of thing. If you're happy to turn the lights down, walk around an old creepy building and have things go BOO! at you, then buy the game.\n\nIf is is important to you that your games have interesting plots, interesting characters, good scripting or challenging puzzles this isn't for you.\n\nMore detail:\nThere is a consistent plot arc running through the three chapters which is completed without leaving many things unexplained but it lacks any detail.\n\nThe puzzles are really lacking. Most involve taking undisguised codes from one part of the environment to open a door in another. I found nothing challenging and therefor not satisfying.\n\nAny creepy atmosphere the game might have generated was ruined by the horrible navigation mechanism. The same icon is at different times used to move you back a step, make you turn around 180 degrees or  move you back a step followed by turning around 180 degrees. It's disorientating and tedious.  It was annoying enough to stop any spooky atmosphere coming through.","April 19, 2015","false","14.6"," 34 of 67 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","34","67","0","3"

It was poorly explained and after finishing the game I'm not really sure I understand, or care enough to try and understand. It was obvious by the end that you were supposed to be invested in the characters, and feel some emotion for them, but I felt none at all. The game did little to help you to connect to the characters anyway.\n\nMy next biggest problem is the "scares". Most of the scares in this game are compromised of jumpscares that are predictable 80% of the time.\n"Ohhh, I'm in a dark hallway using a camera's flash to see, something is gonna pop up- yup there it is"\n"I'm zooming in on a small peep hole, somethings gonna pop up - yup, there it is."\nThe problem is, the jumpscares didn't scare me, they startled me for a moment, and then I went back to the game like normal.\n\nThe graphics are fine and same with the sounds.\n\nSome of the puzzles make little sense and have no clues, but the majority are easy and the clues are blatantly thrown in your face.\n\nWhen you're traveling through hallways with the arrows, a lot of times when you open a door, you'll enter the next section facing the door that you just entered through, which threw me off more times than I can count.\n\nI guess the game is ok, but I would only reccomend buying it on sale.\n\nEdit: Not that it really bothered me, but I couldn't see anywhere on the store page where it stated the game is point in click, which can upset some people if they think they're going into a 3rd person game where you use the keyboard.","May 13","false","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Buy only with caution, discounted if at all.\n\nThe homage to Resident Evil and Silent Hill is, if at all, only tenable in regards to the story development. And even here the game underperforms, with its short duration its over just when you figured out what is happening. Visuals are only okay either, preredered backgrounds that are not even up to current resolution standards.\nThere is simply nothing really outstanding or gratifying about it, sadly.\n\nWhilst the game tries hard to invoke a sense of dread it unfortunately falls short of anything that really invokes a fealing of scaryness or anxiety. As a point and click adventure it may be a good entrance for absolute beginners and people who never played a horror game before but the current price of 10 bucks is nowhere nearly justified with less than 3 hours to beat all three chapters.","March 8, 2015","false","3.0"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

The atmosphere was generally creepy, but there was too much reliance on jump-scares (at least in the earlier portions of the game), and the "locked in a blood-splattered institution of some kind" setting felt a bit juvenile, and only got worse as the story progressed. The plot itself, while somewhat promising to begin with didn't deliver at the end. The art and painting allusions filled me with a brief but futile hope, I mean a collection of Baroque paintings about the Biblical story of Judith was a great touch but there wasn't much done with it, especially with all the implications that specific story could have had on the plot.\n\nThe puzzles were all very different from each other, which was nice and a few of them left me with a genuine feeling of accomplishment once I solved them, but a few did feel a bit cheap or the ways the clues were presented didn't make much sense. And not in the "this is using nightmare/dream logic" way.\n\nThe game is also very short. All three sections only took me about three hours to finish.\n\nOverall, it wasn't terrible, but I couldn't recommend it to anyone in good faith.","February 28, 2015","false","3.2"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

It's not that I didn't enjoy the game. It is, however, quite short - I completed all three chapters in one sitting yesterday - so if you're going to buy, I'd say get it on sale if you can.\n\nOn the positive side, the story was interesting, and some of the effects were pretty creepy. There's a good sense of atmosphere in this game. I also enjoyed the camera chapter in particular, as using the item to reveal secrets was an interesting element.\n\nIn terms of criticism...well, as I said, it's quite short. Also, the level design can be a little confusing. There were a few areas in the game where it wasn't always immediately clear which door to take, where you would find yourself facing a way you didn't expect and it was quite easy to accidentally double back on yourself.\n\nOverall, I'd say this game is just okay. Worth a look if you have a few pounds to burn, but not wishlist material. Nothing awful about it, but then nothing great either. It's a good effort, but there are some much better examples of point and click horror out there.\n\nRecommended with caution.","November 11, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a creepy feeling, and "Decay: The Mare" manages at its best to be a creepy, creepy game.\n\nThis is definitely a "play with the lights out" game. The graphics aren't too sharp, which I enjoy in gritty, horror-themed affairs such as this. They're suitably dark, with haziness and shadows in all the right places. Little touches, like the art and photographs on the walls which occasionally change appearance, are quite eerie. The music plays well with this, predominantly consisting of forlornly beautiful piano pieces. The only thing on my wish list for "Decay" as far as the atmosphere goes is that some of the art unlocked as "Extras" was really spectacular, and I would have liked to see those insane ideas incorporated into the game itself. But this isn't a gory hack-fest, it's more of a spooky mystery/escape story with a few supernatural elements thrown in, so there's only so far it can go.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly basic point-and-click adventure, with some puzzles of mixed difficulty thrown in. Pay attention to details, because what you thought was simply a nifty scare tactic in one room may be the answer to a puzzle in another. While there's nothing too groundbreaking here, there are a few clever bits you can feel good about solving.\n\nThere are two big flaws to consider before playing the game:\n\n1) There is no map function, and although the levels are small, considerable backtracking is required. "Decay" has an odd habit of both making the doors all look the same AND making a single corridor look completely different when viewed from another angle, which can be frustrating when you're trying to get back to the room you were in three screens ago. On top of that, sometimes when you go through a door, you'll end up on the opposite side of the room you're entering, looking straight at the door from which you just emerged. Yes, this adds to the sense of disorientation that your character would be feeling under these circumstances, but it also takes away the fun of exploration and replaces it with tedium.\n\n2) The plot, as thin as it is, sort of falls apart at the end. Without giving anything away, new characters are introduced as late as the last five minutes of the game. The particulars of how everyone ended up there in the first place elude me, and the letters and newspaper articles found throughout the game don't really seem to foreshadow the final reveal. Sure, the main baddie's crimes and motivation are telegraphed early on, but everything involving the main character and his friends falls into the category of "AND THEN SUDDENLY BAD THINGS HAPPENED". I played through the endings several times to see what I might have missed, and was still flummoxed. So, pay attention! Be smarter than me and figure this all out. :)\n\nI'm giving "Decay: The Mare" a thumbs up because it's a good effort. You might want to wait for it to go on sale, and you'll definitely want to use a spoiler-free walkthrough to help you find the tiny indistinct coins scattered about the levels so that you can unlock the extras.  But in the end, I got a couple of hours of enjoyment from it (both here and on Xbox), and the atmosphere it creates was enough to keep me engaged thoughout the game.","November 22, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, the level design can be a little confusing. There were a few areas in the game where it wasn't always immediately clear which door to take, where you would find yourself facing a way you didn't expect and it was quite easy to accidentally double back on yourself.\n\nOverall, I'd say this game is just okay.

In fact, if I hadn't gotten a copy of it in a bundle, I'd probably never even consider in the first place. That being said, however, I decided to play it one night on a whim and found myself pleasantly surprised.\n\nFirst off, this isn't the type of horror game that controls akin to Amnesia or the like (first person WASD control and all that). It's a point-and-click which brought me back to the era of old school horror flash games. It fits the game well, but not everyone may enjoy the control style.\n\nSecondly, this game is not nearly as scary as I was initially expecting. The suspense, however, had me covering my eyes every time I walked through a door or clicked on an object as I was half expecting a cheap jumpscare which never actually came. Yes, there are some scares (keep your eyes out for the portrait in chapter 2, it's terrifying), but they aren't nearly as horrifying as I expected stepping into the game. This could be good or bad based on your preferences, but my tolerance for fear is low. If it had been toned up I probably would have quit the game before I finished it.\n\nThe music is phenomenal and sets the tone very well for the gameplay and the setting. The hallways and rooms you explore become tense in places where needed, puzzle areas provide a moment of clarity, and the moments of downtime in between are accompanied by slower, more deliberate and minimalist tone.\n\nFinally, the story develops a lot more than I would have thought - what at first seemed like a simple method of dropping the player into a degraded, unkempt mess of a place and leaving the story at that actually gradually reveals a full-fledged and engrossing storyline, with a satisfying ending.\n\nThe game is a little short for its price tag - I'd wait for it to go on sale before deciding to pick it up -  but what I assumed was a game that would gather dust and never be played transformed into an experience that I enjoyed upon reflection, and I'd highly recommend making the trip yourself.\n\n8/10","September 28, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a creepy feeling, and "Decay: The Mare" manages at its best to be a creepy, creepy game.\n\nThis is definitely a "play with the lights out" game. The graphics aren't too sharp, which I enjoy in gritty, horror-themed affairs such as this. They're suitably dark, with haziness and shadows in all the right places. Little touches, like the art and photographs on the walls which occasionally change appearance, are quite eerie. The music plays well with this, predominantly consisting of forlornly beautiful piano pieces. The only thing on my wish list for "Decay" as far as the atmosphere goes is that some of the art unlocked as "Extras" was really spectacular, and I would have liked to see those insane ideas incorporated into the game itself. But this isn't a gory hack-fest, it's more of a spooky mystery/escape story with a few supernatural elements thrown in, so there's only so far it can go.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly basic point-and-click adventure, with some puzzles of mixed difficulty thrown in. Pay attention to details, because what you thought was simply a nifty scare tactic in one room may be the answer to a puzzle in another. While there's nothing too groundbreaking here, there are a few clever bits you can feel good about solving.\n\nThere are two big flaws to consider before playing the game:\n\n1) There is no map function, and although the levels are small, considerable backtracking is required. "Decay" has an odd habit of both making the doors all look the same AND making a single corridor look completely different when viewed from another angle, which can be frustrating when you're trying to get back to the room you were in three screens ago. On top of that, sometimes when you go through a door, you'll end up on the opposite side of the room you're entering, looking straight at the door from which you just emerged. Yes, this adds to the sense of disorientation that your character would be feeling under these circumstances, but it also takes away the fun of exploration and replaces it with tedium.\n\n2) The plot, as thin as it is, sort of falls apart at the end. Without giving anything away, new characters are introduced as late as the last five minutes of the game. The particulars of how everyone ended up there in the first place elude me, and the letters and newspaper articles found throughout the game don't really seem to foreshadow the final reveal. Sure, the main baddie's crimes and motivation are telegraphed early on, but everything involving the main character and his friends falls into the category of "AND THEN SUDDENLY BAD THINGS HAPPENED". I played through the endings several times to see what I might have missed, and was still flummoxed. So, pay attention! Be smarter than me and figure this all out. :)\n\nI'm giving "Decay: The Mare" a thumbs up because it's a good effort. You might want to wait for it to go on sale, and you'll definitely want to use a spoiler-free walkthrough to help you find the tiny indistinct coins scattered about the levels so that you can unlock the extras.  But in the end, I got a couple of hours of enjoyment from it (both here and on Xbox), and the atmosphere it creates was enough to keep me engaged thoughout the game.","November 22, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cakes1/recommended/323720/","cakes1","ʕგҚვֆ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cakes1/","1174 products in account","Decay really isn't as bad as it first comes off as, it immediately seems like some low-budget point & click, which has been super popular in the past handful of years. But Decay is set aside from the mumbo jumbo that floods the gaming market nowadays, as it's slightly unique in it's own way, though when it really boils down to the fundamentals, it's nothing special.\n\nDecay is a point & click puzzle horror game, and the puzzles are the correct difficulty (some may be too easy), which is a huge step forward compared to most games of the same genre, which have incredibly specific puzzles which you will probably NEED a walkthrough for ("Scratches" comes to mind). The atmosphere is well established and you can get tied into the game pretty decently, though a lack of depth to the story/characters makes it hard to fully put yourself in Sam's shoes (the main character).\n\nI completed all three episodes and it took me about 2 to 3 hours, and I took my time (took a couple breaks, etc.). It's a short game but I got it for like $0.49 on sale so I'm not complaining about that, also it adequately tells it's story (which is a pretty creative idea) in the correct amount of time so the length isn't a problem. There are a few dramatic cutscenes which explain more of the story which are pretty well-done and some are downright intense, which is cool because most games of this genre have super below-par animation and graphics, but like I said, Decay stands out because it's a bit better than the average point & click puzzle horror.\n\nThough when looking at the theoretical side of Decay, even the good execution doesn't save it from being nothing more than an "above average" point & click puzzle horror. The story is incomplete, and the storytelling features are below par; the entire story is explained on newspaper snippets, which is the only time voice acting is present (and I don't know if it's just me but he reads WAY too slow). Voice acting isn't even present in the cutscenes, which is where I feel they should have allocated the talent, because I can read a piece of paper alone, but when I'm watching two people argue for example, I'd prefer to hear their voices rather than read it.\n\nThis is an ongoing problem for Decay: the developer just flat out made dumb decisions. The navigation is also difficult, given the fact that some rooms will start at the same orientation once you enter it no matter the angle you entered it from (the game is entirely "slide-show" style movement and looking). So for example, if you enter one of these types of rooms from the end of the hall, it will put you on the wrong side facing the door you just came through, making the buildings feel more like a labyrinth than a residential home. And some rooms don't do this, and will orient you correctly, making it just as confusing since you probably expected to be looking at the door you just walked through. It's all very confusing, but you quickly memorize the layout of the buildings in each episode since the maps are relatively constricted, so it's a short-lived con. The small maps aren't really that much of a problem though, as there's a good density of things to do in the amount of space they give you.\n\nAll-in-all, Decay isn't bad. It has a decently creative idea behind it, it's execution is above par, and the length is accurate-albeit short, if that matters to you. But the overall experience is what matters, and while at some points I was super invested in what was happening, and the game DID hold my attention for a good 2.5 hours (which is increasingly rare nowadays), it didn't have a lasting or any sort of serious impact on me. And being a dramatic horror game about murder and finding yourself and the answer to deep life questions, Decay should've made me feel way more.\n\n6.6/10","December 24, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was slow to cycle through multiple items, and I found it annoying and confusing that some items could be spun around in the inventory, and others couldn't. When I got to a puzzle that required that I spun an item around to look at something, I spent about 10-15 minutes wandering around trying to figure out what I was missing. Until finally I realized that I could spin some items. I then tested it with other items and it turns out that only specific items can be spun around.\n\nI'd say it was 7/10 for this style of game.","December 28, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a point and click game, so it runs well on low end machines like mine. The only major issue I have is that, sometimes the orientation can be a bit off. Especially in the first episode, whenever you'd leave a room, it takes a while to get your bearings, but once you get an idea of the layout, you'll find yourself breezing through the game.\n\nThe game is broken into three episodes which can run from 20-40 minutes each, depending upon skill level. At the time of this review, I've unlocked nearly all but two achievements within a span of 2 hours, and this includes both endings.\n\nEmotionally - This game kept me intrigued, although there is a lot left unanswered for me. Whether they be plot holes or up to the imagination of the player, I'm not sure, but while I don't knock the game for it, I personally would have appreciated just a bit more world building in regards to what was going on. Thankfully, both endings give you a concrete understanding of what has happened, but in the midst of exploring, things happen that left me questioning why. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say that while I feel satisfied with the game, I would have liked, perhaps, one more episode to fill in the gaps. Regardless, I had a great time with it.\n\nMost puzzles in this game are straight-forward or easy to understand. There is another review or two that says they don't make sense, but with just one exception, all puzzles have a set up and can be resolved with clues in the environment fairly. I'll admit, however, that the one exception was one of the most irritating puzzles and almost resulted in a rage quit until I solved it through dumb luck and attrition. But, I'm also not strong with riddles and puzzle games, so if puzzles are your strength, you'll probably find them way too easy, especially since I did (minus one).\n","April 30","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of them were childishly easy but some of them made me feel as if I were scooby doo and the whole gang was there except Velma who had taken a holiday.

Overall great game for the sale-price paid (would not be as satisfied if I had paid the full price) if what your looking for is a good scare.","September 6, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact, if I hadn't gotten a copy of it in a bundle, I'd probably never even consider in the first place. That being said, however, I decided to play it one night on a whim and found myself pleasantly surprised.\n\nFirst off, this isn't the type of horror game that controls akin to Amnesia or the like (first person WASD control and all that). It's a point-and-click which brought me back to the era of old school horror flash games. It fits the game well, but not everyone may enjoy the control style.\n\nSecondly, this game is not nearly as scary as I was initially expecting. The suspense, however, had me covering my eyes every time I walked through a door or clicked on an object as I was half expecting a cheap jumpscare which never actually came. Yes, there are some scares (keep your eyes out for the portrait in chapter 2, it's terrifying), but they aren't nearly as horrifying as I expected stepping into the game. This could be good or bad based on your preferences, but my tolerance for fear is low. If it had been toned up I probably would have quit the game before I finished it.\n\nThe music is phenomenal and sets the tone very well for the gameplay and the setting. The hallways and rooms you explore become tense in places where needed, puzzle areas provide a moment of clarity, and the moments of downtime in between are accompanied by slower, more deliberate and minimalist tone.\n\nFinally, the story develops a lot more than I would have thought - what at first seemed like a simple method of dropping the player into a degraded, unkempt mess of a place and leaving the story at that actually gradually reveals a full-fledged and engrossing storyline, with a satisfying ending.\n\nThe game is a little short for its price tag - I'd wait for it to go on sale before deciding to pick it up -  but what I assumed was a game that would gather dust and never be played transformed into an experience that I enjoyed upon reflection, and I'd highly recommend making the trip yourself.\n\n8/10","September 28, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story might as well not be there, navigation is confusing, puzzles are mostly poorly done.

The game begins with the player popping some pills and the game is all about exploring a nightmare world. It's a very low key, casual game. It's not scary but I was startled a few times when something would suddenly jump onto screen in places I've already been and were empty before. The game is broken up into three chapters. Each one has a series of different rooms to move through and figure out the puzzles. In the 3rd episode, you get a stop watch that can used on demand and sometimes it will reverse time and move obstacles out of your way. At one point I picked up a VHS tape, but the only thing around was a DVD player with a TV. It would have been so cool if the solution was to use the stop watch and turn the DVD player into a VHS player. All three chapters play out similarly. If I had to choose, I'd probably say the first chapter was my favorite, but they're all good. It took around 4 hours to finish the game.","March 23, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a good sense of atmosphere in this game. I also enjoyed the camera chapter in particular, as using the item to reveal secrets was an interesting element.\n\nIn terms of criticism...well, as I said, it's quite short. Also, the level design can be a little confusing. There were a few areas in the game where it wasn't always immediately clear which door to take, where you would find yourself facing a way you didn't expect and it was quite easy to accidentally double back on yourself.\n\nOverall, I'd say this game is just okay. Worth a look if you have a few pounds to burn, but not wishlist material. Nothing awful about it, but then nothing great either.

It was slow to cycle through multiple items, and I found it annoying and confusing that some items could be spun around in the inventory, and others couldn't. When I got to a puzzle that required that I spun an item around to look at something, I spent about 10-15 minutes wandering around trying to figure out what I was missing. Until finally I realized that I could spin some items. I then tested it with other items and it turns out that only specific items can be spun around.\n\nI'd say it was 7/10 for this style of game.","December 28, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Loved the art style with detailed and dark/moody scenes throughout.  A good amount of little details and subtle changes to areas kept the dark mood (spookiness) intact.  The game was short (about 3 hours for me with some time being stumped for a while in episode 1).  I ended up with "the good ending", so I assume there is a bad one as well.

Sure, the narrative had potential, but I understood immediatly the limitations of the game. It's a point-and-click. Don't expect a fight scene, having to run away, hiding, etcetera.\n\nIt is all very straightforward. At first I was scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the "thing" following me throughout the centre, but I noticed how it never really "came" for me. Thus the limitations of a point-and-click. No "real" action.\n\nStill, I looked past this and continued with my exploration. The soundtrack was nice and unsettling, some of the characters (one in particular, if you played you know who im talking about) was fun to talk with and the puzzles needed exploration and some thinking, without being overly challenging. The coin-collecting is fun and unlocks some neat extras, I recommend collecting them, the game being pretty short.\n\nTo sum it up, I liked this game, even though point-and-click really aren't my thing.\nI would give it a 6 out of 10. A nice, cheap way to spend time.","December 14, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a creepy feeling, and "Decay: The Mare" manages at its best to be a creepy, creepy game.\n\nThis is definitely a "play with the lights out" game. The graphics aren't too sharp, which I enjoy in gritty, horror-themed affairs such as this. They're suitably dark, with haziness and shadows in all the right places. Little touches, like the art and photographs on the walls which occasionally change appearance, are quite eerie. The music plays well with this, predominantly consisting of forlornly beautiful piano pieces. The only thing on my wish list for "Decay" as far as the atmosphere goes is that some of the art unlocked as "Extras" was really spectacular, and I would have liked to see those insane ideas incorporated into the game itself. But this isn't a gory hack-fest, it's more of a spooky mystery/escape story with a few supernatural elements thrown in, so there's only so far it can go.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly basic point-and-click adventure, with some puzzles of mixed difficulty thrown in. Pay attention to details, because what you thought was simply a nifty scare tactic in one room may be the answer to a puzzle in another. While there's nothing too groundbreaking here, there are a few clever bits you can feel good about solving.\n\nThere are two big flaws to consider before playing the game:\n\n1) There is no map function, and although the levels are small, considerable backtracking is required. "Decay" has an odd habit of both making the doors all look the same AND making a single corridor look completely different when viewed from another angle, which can be frustrating when you're trying to get back to the room you were in three screens ago. On top of that, sometimes when you go through a door, you'll end up on the opposite side of the room you're entering, looking straight at the door from which you just emerged. Yes, this adds to the sense of disorientation that your character would be feeling under these circumstances, but it also takes away the fun of exploration and replaces it with tedium.\n\n2) The plot, as thin as it is, sort of falls apart at the end. Without giving anything away, new characters are introduced as late as the last five minutes of the game. The particulars of how everyone ended up there in the first place elude me, and the letters and newspaper articles found throughout the game don't really seem to foreshadow the final reveal. Sure, the main baddie's crimes and motivation are telegraphed early on, but everything involving the main character and his friends falls into the category of "AND THEN SUDDENLY BAD THINGS HAPPENED". I played through the endings several times to see what I might have missed, and was still flummoxed. So, pay attention! Be smarter than me and figure this all out. :)\n\nI'm giving "Decay: The Mare" a thumbs up because it's a good effort. You might want to wait for it to go on sale, and you'll definitely want to use a spoiler-free walkthrough to help you find the tiny indistinct coins scattered about the levels so that you can unlock the extras.  But in the end, I got a couple of hours of enjoyment from it (both here and on Xbox), and the atmosphere it creates was enough to keep me engaged thoughout the game.","November 22, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a point and click game, so it runs well on low end machines like mine. The only major issue I have is that, sometimes the orientation can be a bit off. Especially in the first episode, whenever you'd leave a room, it takes a while to get your bearings, but once you get an idea of the layout, you'll find yourself breezing through the game.\n\nThe game is broken into three episodes which can run from 20-40 minutes each, depending upon skill level. At the time of this review, I've unlocked nearly all but two achievements within a span of 2 hours, and this includes both endings.\n\nEmotionally - This game kept me intrigued, although there is a lot left unanswered for me. Whether they be plot holes or up to the imagination of the player, I'm not sure, but while I don't knock the game for it, I personally would have appreciated just a bit more world building in regards to what was going on. Thankfully, both endings give you a concrete understanding of what has happened, but in the midst of exploring, things happen that left me questioning why. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say that while I feel satisfied with the game, I would have liked, perhaps, one more episode to fill in the gaps. Regardless, I had a great time with it.\n\nMost puzzles in this game are straight-forward or easy to understand. There is another review or two that says they don't make sense, but with just one exception, all puzzles have a set up and can be resolved with clues in the environment fairly. I'll admit, however, that the one exception was one of the most irritating puzzles and almost resulted in a rage quit until I solved it through dumb luck and attrition. But, I'm also not strong with riddles and puzzle games, so if puzzles are your strength, you'll probably find them way too easy, especially since I did (minus one).\n","April 30","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you move from room to room the view doesn't allways match the direction of travel (I'm strugling to explain this). That is to say, you can go through a door but then be facing the door you just came through instead of facing the direction of travel. Very disorienting :(","May 1","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just move your cursor around and if a hand or magnifier appears, you'll know to check there.\n\nThe puzzles were kind of easy, but also hard at the same time.\nI often noticed that at first I have no idea what I'm supposed to but soon realised it and was able to finish most of the puzzles with ease. The only one I didn't understand was the dice one (which I do now) but while I was thinking about it I ended up accidentally solving it by random.\nNot a single time did I need to use the help button and I usually need to check half the stuff on other games.\n\nThe game didn't have too much scary stuff in it. Sometimes it felt slightly creepy and had a few jumpscares, but nothing too bad.\nMy biggest problem with this was how I needed to move back and forth to continue the game. It's really annoying when you don't know what you're supposed to do and then you go into a room again and suddenly the game continues elsewhere.\n\nAll in all a fun experience.\nIf you're looking for a short (2h) and enjoyable game, then try this.","May 12","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Consists of 3 episodes which follows one another to create a very atmospheric game. Graphics are fair at best, but the story, which comes together at the end, is excellent. The atmosphere is pretty creepy and you have a few scare moments and the music, which sounds alot like those 70's and 80's horror flicks I used to watch, is solid as well. The puzzles are a little complicated as alot of clues and actions you do in one room either changes something in another room or is actually a clue in another room. Makes it quite frustrating at times, but with some work, it can be done. Had several creepy moments, but don't blink or you might miss them.  A fairly short game, but fun none the less. If you like getting the achievements, good luck. Some of them are quite difficult and I got some help figuring some of them out. Others were easier just looking at the pic for the achievement and it gave away the location for said achievment. Nice price for a nice game.","April 17","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
