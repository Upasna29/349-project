Played this and became hooked on all of them since. :) I love the characters, the puzzles, the scenery-- everything! Challenging at times (Google a walkthrough if need be) but a great play for casual gamers who love a good mystery!","April 9, 2014","true","9.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

PC is MUCH easier as the tasks are much smoother. Thank goodness. I had been wondering how this mystery ended and it was nice to start over again. However, it seemed tougher than I remembered in other ways.\n\nI raged so much with this game. Whereas I had no problem playing "Scopa" in "The Phantom of Venice" it is required to beat a character at a game of "Fox and Geese" and I hate that game horribly. It was just a pain to play and no fun. A couple of the puzzles were hard to do with the limited amount of time it takes to do them and I'm just no good at using the snowmobile.\n\nA quirk of the game is that you also have to cook 3 meals a day as well as the housekeeping for most of the game. I'm not sure how to weigh the game when it comes to spoilers though. I've not played the games in order and Tino Balducci appears in this game and is apparently a character that returns from a previous game. While I don't know the whole story with the unmentioned previous game, I do wonder if there are any spoilers with the things Nancy says about him. I guess I'll find out when I play said game.\n\nThis game though takes a lot of patience to play. You have a clock and you have extra duties and it can get dull and repetitive. Things happen at certain times and the game, if you mess up too early, can be a little too unforgiving. I had accidently had issues with the clock and had to restart the whole game because I couldn't meet the guests otherwise.\n\nI think this game was certainly harder than I had expected. It's not impossible, but it can be really agitating. That being said, the story is still interesting and if you have the resolve, it can be rewarding, I suppose. I would suggest it to people who enjoy these types of games. Some people like more of a challenge than I do. I prefer relaxing puzzles and good stories. This game is easy in some ways and hard in others, so it just depends on the sort of player you are. Despite my raging moments, it was nice to finally see how the story ended.","July 28, 2015","true","14.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Much harder than other Nancy Drew's. Last puzzle is a complete pain, took me a couple days to really get it down. Other than that, I think the storyline and characters are really great. How it all unfolds near the end is VERY interesting. If you would like a hard challenge and are familiar with Nancy Drew franchise... I would buy this game.","May 16","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is only one part in the game where you'd have to use the food preparation to your advantage. I found the cook responsibilities tedious and didn't like how you'd be fired if you ignore it.\n\nBut aside from that, I enjoyed the game and would definitely recommend it.","August 11, 2014","true","3.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Too many asinine puzzles with no instructions and a failure to understand the concept of hypothermia. While adding an element of cold is a good concept, Nancy will freeze to death after a few minutes of walking, unless she has a heat pack in her pocket.  To get these, you have to engage an annoying  poorly rendered character in a snowball fight. Then there is the cooking minigame... Fail to make meals within the alloted timeframe and your employer sacks you. The woman who hired you to investigate the accidents will fire you if you don't make those omelets just right? WTF? I know it's only a game, but these titles usually have a goodly amount of educational  value. This has very little, as well as an exceptionally poorly rendered wolf. I'd recommend ANY other Drew game for adventure gamers, but this one is just lame.","June 22, 2015","false","8.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/31930/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1581 products in account","I would give this game a "meh" rating. If you're a Nancy Drew game fan then go for it, if not then it might not be your cup of tea. It's fun but it's also frustrating and tedious. Also, I hate Fox and Geese now.\n\nThe game should not have taken me as long as it did to finish, that's just first and formost. Why did it take so long? Because besides being a dectective Nancy is also made the maid and cook at the inn you're staying at; joy! Now, these two extra jobs were actually easy to do but time consuming. There is an in game clock and you have to wake up and make breakfast plus maid duties and then fit in investigating. Oh, but make sure to be back in time to make lunch and dinner. Oh, but the weather outside also plays a factor so there are only certain times it's safe to go outside. Needless to say, night time isn't one of them so after a certain hour of the day you're stuck at the inn.\n\nThe game itself wasn't hard but the time factor dragged everything on longer than it needed to be. The story itself wasn't bad, easy to figure out though. But I would take being the maid/cook any day over having to ever play Fox and Geese again.","June 23, 2015","false","8.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I'd also apparently lived under a rock for quite some time because I hadn't known that games were made based in her adventures. I really enjoyed this game since it was one that made you think and combined some casual games with some not so causal ones. I especially liked working with the wolf.\n\nThat darn Fox and Geese game irritated me greatly though. The man just wouldn't go to the quarter I needed him in. It took some time to get the wins I needed for that puzzle. I also am now going to have to get a Fox and Geese board for the kids and I.\n\nI really recommend this game to a mystery lover that likes to think. I don't recommend it to those that are used to games that are just bash and trash.","January 29","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
