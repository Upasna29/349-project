It is well crafted and stable and no bugs have come to my knowing. It has some minor balance issues and design flaws. Overall i can recommend this game to people interested in RTS, who like to take on a challenge. This game is difficult. Stay away from it if you can not stand losing over and over again.\n\nThe UI is thought out well and is very intuitive.\nVisuals are done nicely, no eyesore to be expected.\nThe current standard price of about 20$ is more than justified.\n\n\n\nWhat is it about?\nTo sum it up: The russian devs have built a hero management simulation on top of a classic RTS basis. It plays pretty fresh, and feels damn good.\n\nBasically, the units you build have minds on their own. There is no way to directly control them.\nThey do hero stuff, they wander around in search of monsters and loot, they level up just like all heroes do and can become even better with shinier armor and bigger swords.\nGiven some time, success and little dying they can develop from a wooden sword swinging wannabe knight to a professional murdering machine.\n\nThey misjudge their chances and die in silly ways quite often, hindering the individual progress, cost you a lot of money and ultimately, cause you to fail the map. So, the chaotic bunch needs to be directed somehow.\nThis is where the player jumps in. You can interact with various Spells on a smaller scale, but: What do heroes like ? Exactly, shiny things and money.\n\nOrders are handled by issuing quests. For example, there is a wolves den which annoys you. You can create a quest for your guys, by putting a reward on it. Heroes will take on that quest if they feel like its worth it, and soon, the wolves den will be history.\nThe earned money then goes to that heroes purse and he will use it to buy Potions, enchant or buff himself in Guildhouses or buy new equipment if he doesn't die before he can spend it.\nThe money spent by heroes comes back to your purse for the most part, so its a game of give and take. With the added risk of the hero dying, resulting in loss of that money with additional resurrection costs. (These can become very very costly with increasing levels)\n\nAll Heroes will be acting selfishly on their own by default, giving little to no support to the "competing" heroes. Later on, you get the Option to group them into parties of up to four, making them work together to combine their abilities and increase in power by a lot. But also decreasing their response to quests significantly, which means, they'll consider themselves very elite and move out only for phat lewt.\n\nAfter every mission you get the chance to promote one hero to "Lord", saving him for reuse on the following maps. Which is a good but costly option. Some maps can only be won by utilizing this feature wisely. All other heroes are lost on map transition.\n\nThis might sound all nice and cozy, and, yeah, when the basics are understood, the first few missions are not much of a problem.\nBut the difficulty rises quite fast and brutal. The maps are very different from each other and you will need to come up with a solid build order and make it work over several attemps on each new mission again. You are under constant attack from the very beginning and can fail the mission very fast if attempting the wrong way. Gamechanging scripted events can cause sudden death even later on if handled wrong.\n\nIt soon becomes a game of Chess, were you will need a clear plan of what to do when and perfect execution. The combination of this with the games occasional randomness can cause frustration at times. You've done nothing wrong, but still are wiped out brutally.\n\nThis factor will multiply when later on, your opponents have leveling heroes as well, and failure will therefore be punished twice, by losing a lot of money, and having to face more powerful enemies. Resulting in very very frustrating moments.\n\n\nI'd say, the game, a couple of hours in, is a lot about trial and error and aims towards players with some dedication and will to win and has nothing to offer for casual players at all.\nFor the more hardcore, there is a lot of fun to be had here.\n\n\nHaving played the first part too, i really hope for a Majesty 3, the Game has come a long way already. I hope the developers see that too and give it another attempt. They could turn this already damn good, but underdog, game into a total blockbuster.","August 13, 2015","true","52.9"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","31","34","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Khranos/recommended/73020/","Khranos","Khranos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Khranos/","135 products in account","Update 5/12/16 Paradox has given up trying to fix a bug which renders all paid in-game store upgrades useless (extra temples, spells, missions, blacksmith upgrades, et cetera). They have already fixed it a few times, but are no longer providing support. The game is still worth it, but with much of the value gone, it may be best to buy it when it's on sale (which may contradict this review further down).\n\nI know this game has been out for quite a while, but I'm mostly reviewing it to state it's still worth getting -- even at full price! I have about 300 more hours from a DRM free version, so 54 hours is not accurate.\n\nIf you're just curious about the "Collection" edition portion, it is worth the money based on the sheer amount of content added.\n\nFor those who haven't played the first... (see below if you have played the first)\n\nIt isn't important that you have played the first, as there isn't really any important information to transfer to the second. If you have ever wanted to play an RTS in which you don't have to deal with managing everything your units are doing, this is likely the game for you. It requires quick thinking (or average thinking at .2x speed) and some knowledge of each guild and building, but the main campaign eases you into the game at a pace that will teach you all you need to know. Many of the missions have unique side missions to make sure there's variation each time you play.\n\nCertain missions can be very difficult and will require you to be entirely precise in your decisions at the start (such as the mission in the King Maker expansion that sends a bunch of dragonlings at you near instantly). Clerics and Dwarven towers will quickly become your best friends.\n\nFor those who have played the first...\n\nI've played the original majesty for likely 400+ hours, and have a lot of knowledge and memories of it to show for it. I see a lot of the negative reviews and comments are based solely upon the original "being better". I personally find this one to be much more than the first in almost every way.\n\nIf you've played the first, you can expect to miss this... (cons)\nThe tournament has been removed (my biggest negative)\nHeroes are harder to guide.\nNo more naming of heroes.\nMushrooms for poison have been turned into just an upgrade.\nReligious temples are now only able to be placed at set locations.\nA few other things.\nHowever, the additions make this one worth playing. (pros)\nMuch easier UI to use.\n3D graphics (which in my opinion are better).\nMany buildings combined (the library is now inherent in guilds) (may not be a pro to some)\nMore guilds.\nA few extra skills, including skills gained at certain levels per class.\nMore intuitive spell system.\nMany more missions.\nAbility to play as the enemies in a special campaign mode.\nBuildings don't completely catch fire when a rat bites it (who else was annoyed by this?)\nHeroes don't feel as squishy. (except for the mage. Expect them to still die every five seconds for their lower levels)\nMany more things.\nAs for the difficulty...\n\nYes, this game is 0 to 100 on certain missions, but all of them are completely possible. You will have to utilize the .2x speed button very frequently and will occassionally have to baby-sit your lower leveled powerful heroes with the heal spell.\n\nIf all else fails, you can usually go back to using two cleric guilds at the start. Clerics are the toughest unit in the game as long as you can keep them together, as they're nearly infinitely powerful as long as some mana exists. Shortly after, you will want to get dwarves for both the unit and especially the tower. One tower alone is enough to kill a werewolf or a dragon, which can easily level an entire settlement early on. By placing a normal guard tower behind each dwarven tower, you effectively multiply the effectiveness of each tower by a decent bit.\n\nKrypta appears to be the most useful special hero for their sheer ability to stay alive while dealing heavily spread out damage with their minions.\n\nAlso, do not forget to use inns. Having a few scattered on each side can save your heroes, since often times the guild is just far enough to have them killed when they retreat.\n\nConclusion\n\nAll in all, I feel this one is more full than the first. There are some noticeable changes, but for the most part, it's just something to get used to rather than miss intensely. This game is worth your time, and will immerse you faster than you might expect.","August 17, 2015","true","83.1"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","27","29","0","3"

Even when I don't feel like playing anything else, I can play a round of Majesty. Some folks like to call out the game's difficulty like it were a bad thing. I won't pretend like it isn't hard, and that I don't routinely restart missions, but that just means you actually have to strategize and plan ahead. I consider it fun! And because of the "Randomize" feature (on top of several campaigns + stand-alone missions), the game has incredible replayability. I do notice that sometimes the game crashes when I go to save, which isn't a problem for me because I've completed everything already, but for new players, I should warn you.\n\nI recently bought the Collection on Steam because it includes DLC that is no longer being sold.

So you have wishes and a bunch of gold to make wishes come true and there are people who can help you to do that. If they want to. In Majesty 2 you cannot feel that atmosphere of being a king. It's more like an ordinary RTS game.\n\nBesides, despite advanced graphics, I like original Majesty art better. I mean buildings, characters etc. They were more authentic than in Majesty 2. Here we have some genereic medieval buldings and not a Rogue's guild or Temple of Krypta.\n\nWhen I'm playing the original Majesty, I always imagine myself as Vetinari, the patrician of Ankh-Morpork. Obviously the city, which I am building is Ankh-Morpork. Dunno, I always imagined Ankh-Morpork just like that.\n\nI would like to have sequel, which have art and AI of original Majesty. Not a generic gimped RTS.\n\nNevertheless, if we look at this as a separate game and not a sequel, then it's pretty nice.\n\nConclusion is: if you want some new experience in strategy games definitely get this. If you're an old-school fan of Majesty, then I don't think that you will like this, because it's lacks the atmosphere of original game. It's better for you to view this as a stand-alone game.","March 17, 2015","true","4.5"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","23","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jake10495/recommended/73020/","jake10495","DragonShout","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jake10495/","94 products in account","I love this game. I have been playing the Majesty games for over a decade and I absolutely love them. Majesty 2 is definitely not as good as the original, but it has its pro's. For instance, it's way prettier. And I love playing as the bad guys in Monster Kingdom.\n\nAll this is great, however, steam done ♥♥♥♥ed up. Again. When I bought this collection on amazon (5ish years ago), it was awesome. The game is still awesome, however the steam version is buggy. Enragingly buggy. For instance, crashing AS YOU WIN A MISSION AFTER TRYING IT FOR HOURS. Luckily, whenever I load up whenever this happens it save my campaign and it says I won the mission. Unfortunately, I am never able to pick the lord of the region (or whatever they call it) because it crashed after I win, not after I pick a hero to save. So that's horrible.\n\nEven more rageful, the last mission I played, I spent 3 hours trying to beat this level. I finally demolished every single character on the map (other than roaming ones from off the map). It wasn't letting me continue. I checked my quests and it said that one was incomplete... the quest said I had to kill this one Priestess of Agrella and her dwarven allies. I killed all of them. And I spent almost a half an hour searching for a dwarf that I may have missed. I revealed the entire map, and I was right, I killed ALL of them. So the mission derped and didn't recognized that I killed everything. So my game is pretty much trapped in a Majesty limbo. Do I play the entire level again, spend hours to possibly have it not register again? Considering that I cannot advance in the campaign without it, I don't have many options. Instead of spending hours doing it again when I already beat it, I'm leaving an angry review for Steam's lazy ♥♥♥ debugging and their  pitiful upkeep on the games they have.\n\nI have 104 games on steam. I'm a bit of a game hoarder and I love steam for what it is. However, I have noticed that they BUTCHER perfectly good and perfectly working games on the regular. It's moronic. Majesty 2 and Age of Mythology are, in my opinion, some of Steam's biggest letdowns.\n\nSo yes, I recommend buying and playing this game (after you play Majesty 1). However, don't try buying and playing it on steam because it will make ANYONE rageful. Whether or not you are a fan of the series. I highly encourage you all to buy it from anywhere else, other than steam.\n\nTo the steam people, stop royally screwing up my favorite games. It's utterly disgusting. If you want us versatile gamers (those of us who play a wide variety of games) to continue buying things from you, STOP ♥♥♥♥ING UP. This seems almost lazy. You take perfectly working games and somehow make them broken. It's fascinating and aggrivating. If you simply have too many games to make them all work well, then maybe make the games you have work at full capacity instead of offering twice as many broken games? I don't know how your system works and I truly love some of the things you provide- and I respect how much attention you give indie gamers. But this theme of half completed and half broken games is getting old.

Also the voice acting in Majesty 2 is way more funny than Warlock!\n\nI recommend the base game over the collection.  Why?  Because it does become tedious after a while.  The game pits "thicker" and thicker enemies, and once you understand the game mechanics it's just a matter of time to finish any board.  They get longer and longer.\n\nI don't think of that as more and more difficult - or more and more ___interesting___ - just more and more tedious.\n\nBut the base game mechanic is still great, and there's a sense of humor on 2 levels: the voice acting is funny, but also it's funny to set a reward on some enemy who the adventurers are clearly not ready for and watch them all run in to their deaths.  :)  Also, seeing a level 30 skeleton wandering through town blasting everyone and they all go flying and screaming in the air!  Hilarious!!\n\n\nUPDATE1:  While there can optionally be randomized spawns per map, each scenario is a customized story complete with voice acting.  So there is a thread of continuity playing through the campaign which combined with the humor has better effect than other game campaigns.  I am somewhat motivated to dredge myself through the overly difficult levels just to see what story they came up with.  I think the dead bride skeleton king level sold me on the storytelling - it's not ad hoc moments of "wow" like might happen in a random map (say in a TBS) but a deliberate story being told.  I would have to finish all of them to make any comment on the quality of the story, but the humor does go a long way for making the experience memorable.\n\nUPDATE2:  .. and... there's the music.  I loved the music in Warlock - it was some of the best I think I had ever heard in a TBS.  And now that same theme song plays here.

Plus the Advisor makes a great narrator, adding a sense of whimsy and fun.","December 31, 2013","true","142.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I'm a fan of real time and turn based strategy games and I must say that I've thoroughly enjoyed playing this game.  Just finished the original and kingmaker campaigns, it sure was fun.\n\nDon't think multiplayer works for this game but singleplayer is great.  In 64 hours of gameplay it has crashed on me only once.  So can't say it has many bugs.  The game is nicely polished and has good graphics for its age.  Haven't played Majesty 1, the graphics there are a bit of a turn off unfortunately, although many people think the gameplay of the older version is better.\n\nThe campagn missions can be very difficult but they are beatable.  The increasing difficulty pushes you to explore the game more and read up on some strategies if you get really stuck.  When you are finally able to beat that difficult mission,  like the Rat King or The Avatar, then it feels really satisfying :)  With the Rat King mission I built a mage guild and then a wizard tower and kept activating it to protect my warriors until they levelled up.\n\nEconomy is very important in this game, try to position your marketplace next to a trade post and then build a tower next to the market so the tax collector doesn't have very far to walk.   Group your economic buildings like the blacksmith and the potions bazaar next to that tower as well.\n\nThere are a variety of strategies available with each mission.  You can create 'tanking' groups of 3 clerics + 1 dwarf.  Although groups don't seem to retreat as well as individual heroes.  Rangers are a good early to mid game option.  Some players build the Hall of Lords straight away.  Some of the cheap lords like levelled up Rogues and Rangers can be very useful in the early game and mid game, and that's usually the most crucial time.  A levelled up lord is not always the best option, it may be better to have lower level templars with good weapons so they are cheaper to buy.  And so on a so forth.\n\nSure the first game may have more options but Magesty 2 also offers alot of good gameplay so I think this game is sometimes rated unfairly, because it is a great game.  And if its on sale then its definitely worth it :)","October 9, 2015","true","102.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

With new flags like guarding, you never have to worry about a skeleton ruining your entire economy because it got lucky and killed the caravan carrying much needed gold.\n\nStronger guards: Palace and guard tower guards can now stand toe to toe with moderately strong enemies. Tax collectors seem much happier in this game. Arrows come with the guard tower, no need to spend gold researching them.\n\nStronger classes in general: Mages and Rangers no longer die in 1-2 hits from rats anymore, clerics not only do actual damage, but they are even harder to kill than before. Mages do not have the extreme overkill capacity as they did in Majesty 1 if they survived to level 10, but they make up for it with better defenses / ai / and utility (freezing enemies). Elves have been buffed to the point of being useful unless you have to go with dwarves to fight early dragon onslaughts.\n\nSkeletons now reliably killable by level 1 Warriors: Skeletons are no longer magic resist / dodge gods and for the player, dwarves have taken their place for fighting strong magic monsters like dragons.\n\nParties: You can now assign 4 heroes to a party. This allows you to tactically place your clerics where they need to be, and generally makes your heroes almost invulnerable.\n\nEnemy spawn rates increased: If you do not plan accordingly, you can have your low level heroes die to hordes of rats and skeletons while your better heroes are off doing the objective. Guard towers fix this problem easily, but I like to keep them to a minimum so that my heroes can level up and acquire gold for upgrades.\n\nMore upgrades: Your casters now gain magic attack when they upgrade their weapons, and every class has a plethora of upgrades to purchase.\n\nI've read many reviews saying this game is too difficult. Without spoiling too much, learn the strengths and weaknesses of the heroes and learn how to set up and properly defend your economy, if your tax collectors die, you get no gold. Do not overlook palace upgrades. Remember your build orders so you can try something different if you fail.\n","October 8, 2015","true","8.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

So here will suffice. I rate this game 8.5/10 and I played the original Majesty too (rate:9/10). M2 is a sim  RTS+RPG game, Like RTS games you have create an economy, research, create armies and destroy the opponents. The sim part is because you don't control the units (caled heroes). You assign rewards to kill a monster or destroy a building and depending on the reward 0 or more of your heroes will go achieve your task (more money = more heroes). There are soe 5 different kinds of tasks you can assign to heroes. The heroes will buy themselves upgrades provided that you created the necessary buildings and invested  on the research (which cost gold). Placing the buildings is your task and its important. There are defense towers and many other kinds of buildings (15+). Heroes level as they gain more experience (RPG component). I love this whole concept of the Majesty series.\n\nPlus points:\n\n- Unique take on RTS\n- A variety of heroes: gnomes, archers, paladins, monks, necromancers (some 15+ types)\n- Rock-paper-scissors system. .\n- Varied gameplay in the campaign.\n- RPG element s great. You can check each of your heroes and see what spells/powers they have learned.\n- Game is well polished.\n\nMinus points:\n\n- Some of the latter missions are way too difficult. Basically, large number of monsters are thrown on your base before you even got the chance to set your economy. This frustrates the last 1/3 of the campaign. The first 2/3 are great. Its a shame. Maybe they should have add difficulty levels.\n- So there are cheats and the player is forced to either spend hours figuring out how to beat each of these later missions or use the cheats, which is a shame either way.\n- The concept is so amazing, one can't help feel that they could have designed a better campaign. One of the (hard) missions is to defeat two opposing kingdoms. It is incredibly cool as each of the opponents is using different armies. They could have thought other missions like that.","October 11, 2014","true","18.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Don't let my hours played fool you. I owned these games before steam was so common place and have likely sunk over 100 hours into Majesty 1 and at least 70 or so into Majesty 2.\n\nBut what is the game like? Well, Majesty is an RTS game yes, but it is best described as being god of your own little fantasy MMORPG. Your units in the game act on their own free will, and you must tempt them to do deeds for the kingdom by setting up quests for them to accomplish in the game by way of bounties. It's an unusual system, that can occassionally be difficult to get the hang of, but once you do it feels natural.\n\nLike players in an MMO your units will level up, learn skills, & go to the shops and buy potions, weapons, armor, and whatever magic trinkets your market might have for sale. One of them might even get lucky and come across an extremely powerful weapon early in the game and go on to become a powerful lord of your land, valliantly defending against hordes of creatures that instantly wipe out your younger units, giving them breathing room to grow in power.\n\nI could ramble on for much longer about why I love this game, but I'll try to throw together a good old fashion pro's and cons list\n\nPro's:\n-Beautiful fantasy art style and graphics. Every unit in the game looks great right from the start, but as they level up and purchase new weapons and armor their appearance changes in a satisfying and meaningful way. A level 1 warrior looks like nothing compared to a level 15 warrior.\n\n-Combat, while not being super involved on the part of the player, is always satsifying and fun to watch. As your units learn new skills either from training at a guild, or from leveling up, the way they fight changes. It's always neat to see the heroes fighting in new ways as the game goes on.\n\n-Intimidating monsters and quests that will challenge you. Because of the unusual method for defending your kingdom, it's not nearly so easy to defend in this game. Bunkering up with thousands of troops is not something you can do, so proper management is something you'll have to learn\n\n-Great silly voice acting from the royal advisor, and many good lines from your units. The dialog is just fun, that's all there really is to say about that.\n\n-Economics are easy to grasp, not spreadsheet material, but not ♥♥♥♥ easy either. You will run out of money, and you will suffer for it, but you wont need a college degree to figure out how to maintain your kingdom.\n\nCon's:\n\n-The game is hard, and if you've never played a majesty game before, then you're going to have a bit of a rough time starting out (Though for some this can easily be a pro)\n\n-It's frontloaded. Many missions are only hard at the start. By the time you establish your kingdom and have several powerful heroes wandering around, you'll easily take the rest of the mission by storm. (This is more of a problem with the vanilla campaign, and not so much with the DLC's)\n\n-Takes forever to unlock everything. You will have to complete over 70% of the in game missions to have every building and unit unlocked. This can be frustrating if your favorite unit or building is one of the very last to be unlocked.\n\n-AI is sometimes very stupid. Generally your units will do fine without your guidance and only need you to give them a quest for something majorly out of the way, like to raid an enemy keep, or defend a trading post. But sometimes a unit will choose to go to the store when a lich is about to blow their house to smithereens, and....well that is annoying.","August 15, 2015","true","36.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Goblin experts are annoying as hell.","March 30, 2012","true","94.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The "flag rewards" are all on one hud, so is the palace button, the buildings are organized in categories, etc. So what is Majesty 2? You essentially build your kingdom, recruit some heroes and give away some bounties. Heroes will decide if they want to goof around, do some adventuring on their own (very rare but possible), maybe do some shopping in the blacksmith you upgraded for them (and hey, if they spend money, you get it back with taxes) or just follow your "bounties". That's right, you don't control them, but you can tell them "Hey I'll pay you 300 gold for taking out that wolves' den". In Majesty 2 you can make parties too, seems strange that a King should concern itself with it, but hey, better me than a stupid AI, so you make your parties balanced and off you go for adventure.\nHaven't tried multiplayer yet, but I heard Internet servers are down and only LAN can be played, but anyway, I really like this game, there is enough rpg elements like abilities, levels, equips, stats for your heroes to love the customization and rts elements (more like city management rts but yeah). The last great part about this, which is highly personal, is that the game is in Ardania, the fantasy world and culture that I learned to love through Warlock - Master of the Arcane. All the bad rewievs didn't give me much hope for this game, but it's awesome, mods heavily recommended (they balance quite some things, I use Majesty 2 Reloaded).","February 5, 2013","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Think of the gold rewards as priorities higher the reward faster they will do something if you set reward to 100 and then set a rward on same type of attack at 500 they will go for the one has the most pay out.

What this game has done is reliven an old game, and add some new difficulty and strategy which will leave you frustrated, thinking upon new ideas to beat the levels, and saying to yourself 'just one more try' at 2am in the morning.\nI personally think the best thing about this game, is by far the expansions. Monster Kingdom added a new depth and level of play for me, and I loved the idea of facing previous allies as your previous enemy.\nSo, all in all, before I write an essay, I would reccomend this game.

The closest you get are bounties you can set to have them attack enemies/buildings, defend buildings/caravans, explore an area, or stay away from something they are in no way ready to handle. As the king, you decide what gets built, what heroes get hired, things to research and upgrade, and are allowed to spend some of your cash on spells for more influence on the course of the game.\n\nUnfortunately, just like the first game, this one suffers from the problem of needing to be lucky for the first few minutes and hope that the den of mini-dragons that can kill every hero in one attack doesn't decide to send a wave towards you before you've even built a single barrack or guard tower. But the times when you don't get imediately ♥♥♥♥ed from the start are what make the game great. Do you invest in upgrading the rouges guild so that all your heroes have their weapons poisoned? Maybe build a guard tower next to the sewer entrance so that the ratmen that come from it don't ravage your marketplace? Or do you research better spells, equipment, and potions for your heroes to use? Coming to forkroads like that  and then playing them out to see if you made the right choice are what gives the game so much character, if you can bear the 10 failed attempts beforehand where a boss teir dragon decided to attack your palace as soon as you loaded the level.","August 19, 2014","true","11.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Anyone that has played the original majesty will fall head over heels for this. It's an RTS that doesn't actually let you control your troops. It's more like you are the king and you see all that happens in your kingdom, order buildings to be constructed, set bounties to ENCOURAGE your troops(A.K.A. heroes)to do things like attack enemy buildings, protect your own buildings or explore a certain spot. It's an actually difficult game that takes a lot more concentration and strategy than you would first think. However there are multiple different stages that can be played and you can improve your strategy, rhythm by doing so. Something cool that was added in for Majesty 2 is the idea of the lords: for each land(or territory or stage whatever you wanna call them) that you conquer, you can "hire" one of the heroes you got there to be a lord. They keep whatever eqipment, experience and spells they aquire when you use them and you can hire them again on the other stages for a price. Better yet, there is no money sink. Once you have bought the game, you can buy expansions, but you don't have anything like "magic gems" to buy a load of in-game crap. Once you have the game, it's all you: skill, determination, and strategy will help you win.","May 19, 2014","true","86.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Also - in the original you were able to follow your heros around very very easily. In this version it is a lot more disjointed.\n\nOverall, I would say that the original is better.

I expected the same or better with this second iteration. Sadly, it failed to deliver because of the difficulty for some missions were set to impossible. I got stuck in the "Mortal Foibles of Kings" and cannot go much further.  My initial impression felt like the developers did not do a play test.\n\nI, for one, truly hate those rogue/rogue-like games that has no option to set the level of difficulty because I feel the developers of those type of games are just plain lazy. They do not care for the rest of the gamers who don't enjoy difficult & stressful game play. I believe good games should have difficulty settings and can be tweaked by gamers to suit their play style.  Majesty 2 is not a rogue-like game but it feels much worse. It is an old school RTS that is impossible to finish due to overwhelming obstacles rendering it unnervingly unbalanced in favor of the game. Rather than presenting an enjoyable experience for their paying customers, the developers chose to punish us.\n\nI hope they will release a patch that will enable the players to somewhat configure the level of difficulty... or if they don't have enough resources left to allocate for that, just provide an easy way to enter cheat codes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vampire337/recommended/73020/","vampire337","Vampire337","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vampire337/","808 products in account","This was the game I was looking for.  I discovered Majesty as a mobile app, and when I read that it was a port from PC (a well-done port, in my opinion), I decided to get it here on Steam.  I also got Majesty and Majesty HD, and while fundamentally similar in gameplay, they don't have the polished graphics that Majesty 2 has, and have that feel of a game a bit too old to get into in 2014.  If only I had played it a decade ago and had nostalgia driving me to return.\n\nSo in short, if you're looking for something different in RTS, namely a game where you don't directly control the heroes you've created, this is well worth some play time.  You build buildings and train adventurers of various classes.  You choose upgrades to stock the stores you've erected.  The adventurers you train will go out and explore and kill stuff, then buy items from the stores, provided you've researched the items they can afford.  When you want something killed or an area explored, you set a bounty and the adventurers decide who goes to collect.  The graphics aren't going to blow you away, but they're well-drawn and the game mechanics are a lot of fun.\n\nOne thing I've struggled with a bit: I haven't found any selectable difficulty options, and the levels are all laid out linearly despite being displayed on a map as though you could just select what challenge you're ready for.  When you progress to a difficult level, it is difficult and there isn't a lot you can do about it but retry until you figure out what you need to upgrade in what order.  This makes for a bit of tedium as you play for ten minutes and figure out that you lost in the first minute.  The only thing you can take with you between levels are heroes you've promoted to 'Lord' status, and if you've got some lords who are of a decent level but not too good you might be able to get a jump on a tough level, assuming you have enough starting gold to pay for the Hall of Lords and also to hire the lords, (the better they are, the more they cost, which limits the number of times you can do this as they will inevitably level up and cost more the next time you need them).  Outside of that, most levels require you to figure out the exact order to upgrade the exact right type of troops for each map, which removes any illusion of free will in how you approach each level, and a bit of the fun.\n\nBottom line: very challenging, bit more linear than I was hoping for, but a solid RTS-with-a-twist.","October 12, 2014","true","11.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's a RTS - sort of - where you only control building construction and a "reward system". Through constructing buildings in your fantasy city, you attract adventurers. Warriors, rogues, clerics, mages, etc. They earn gold by completing quests you give them, like attacking monsters and clearing lairs. In turn they spend that gold in your buildings, buying items such as healing potions and weapon/armour upgrades, which in turn gives you gold to buy or upgrade new buildings. It's a unique concept for an RTS. The game is a little dated now and it doesn't quite realize it's full potential, which is a shame.

Majesty one really was about a Kingdom simulation, Majesty 2 is a RTS with heavy RPG elements.\n\nBut if you just let Majesty be itself and not compare it to 1, it has very good gameplay.\nThere are enough scenarios and campaigns for everyone, the maps are all very different and varied, the game is challenging, but not unfair. And with the bundled DLC, there are a lot of different types of units to try out that all come with around 8 special abilities unlocked by levels.\n\nThe RPG mechanics can create funny situations. One of my favourite was when my heroes battled a huge dragon and everything was well, then suddenly, just in in an MMO raid, my eldest wizard casts his best nuke and gets the dragons attention, making the dragon turn towards him and breath fire. Of course, all healers and casters were at that spot....\nIt also feels very rewarding to groom your little heroes from wielding the stereotypiccal wooden sword to dueling dragons in their runic armor.\nOr babysitting the wizard that died to a rat 7 times until he can level whole armies with one spell...while making sure the rest of the kingdom doesnt crumble underneath you.\n\nHowever, there are two issues.\nThe first one is that the middle missions in the first campaign can fail at the very start, which is a source for a lot of anger directed at this game. What happens is that those missions throw monsters at the player very early and its pure luck if they attack something useless and thus let the player get out his first heroes to defend himself, or of they attack something important like a builder and thus significantly cripple the player in the first minutes, making him fight an impossible fight.\nThis issue was however fixed in all other campaigns, its unfortunate that the first few missions expose the new players to this.\n\nThe other issue is that the last campaign simply crashes and is not finishable for the majority. This is a serious nagetive point.\n\n\n\nAll in all, i can recommend this game to people who like a challenge and want to try something new. The RPG mechanics are fun!","November 27, 2013","true","124.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you’re not familiar with the first game, you are the king and you need to keep your kingdom safe by completing quests. Each quest has a difficulty level and set of starting parameters. In the first game you could take on one of these quests or set up your own quest. This feature is gone in Majesty 2. The graphics are considerably better as well. The quests themselves, however, are the same basic idea. I think there may actually be fewer quests.\nAll and all, still a good game.

Monster Kingdom is best expansion yet, adding monster sidekicks.

Majesty 2 has a little less charm, but the fact that it's more complex and generally just has more content makes it one of my most dearest time wasters.\nEven so I only tentatively recommend it for people that already know what they're getting into, fans of Majesty or indirecto control strategy games like Dungeon Keeper will feel right at home, but there's no denying that Majest 2 is a fairly tedious and repetitive game once you get past the first few missions.","January 1, 2013","true","11.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

Instead you supply them with potions, new weapons, enchantsments etc. In order for them to do your dirty jobs, you'll have to place bounty flags on targets (whether it's for killing or defending).\n\nNow, for the actual review; I found myself drawn into this game rather fast - I was a big sucker for the first one, and even though this one gave off a different 'vibe', I did end up falling in love. It wasn't this "love-at-first-sight" dealy like with Majesty 1, but rather a more of a rebound type of love. You know the feeling. She looks like your ex, she talks like your ex, even somewhat similar personalities -- but at the end of the day it's NOT your ex.\nFor all intends and purposes this *is* Majesty - but without the British accent - without the extra edge and charm.\nThe Campaign was interesting, and I'm fond of the fact that they mention the acheivements of the previous rulers (you). The Expansions were... Meh. I mean new missions - yay - doesn't help that they are rather bland. Don't even get me started on the Monsters-pack, so many spelling errors etc.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is... Don't fool yourself into thinking this is Majesty. It isn't. It plays the same way, and it's great as a standalone title. Just don't be blinded by the title and the shiny "2" after it.\n\nFor this kind of game it's quite nice. 7/10.","November 24, 2014","true","157.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It was reminiscent of the first game and I was LOVING it. Come to the Rat King and the mission with Rafnir- my campaign has come to a standstill. Within the first 45 seconds (not even enough time to get a guard tower built), your town is overrun by either rats or dragons (depending on which quest you are on). The provided guards are weak, slow, and have no actual endurance, and are killed quickly. If you ARE lucky enough to get a hero guild up (obviously warriors seem to get you the farthest) the level one warriors are greeted by level 3-5 mobs and are killed quickly, closely followed by the destruction of the guild, wasting the 500g you just spent.\n\nI've tried every imaginable offensive and defensive strategy, followed people's reccomendations, and to no avail, I still sit stuck on those two quests.\n\nWhat is the good of the overrun tactic? How is the game supposed to be enjoyable? The missions are basically the same, just different mobs and landscapes. Try not to get overrun, and try to afford heroes to go to some place and escort a caravan that will quickly become monster fodder because they're weak and the hero AI makes them a bunch of wimps.\n\nSad, sad experience, 1C. Sad. You've suceeded in ruining what was hopeful to be a wonderful reawakening of one of my favorite games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hotspurr/recommended/73020/","hotspurr","Hotspurr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hotspurr/","194 products in account","This is a great game that takes a departure from stnadard RTS games in that you don't have direct control over your units. You start each level with a castle and you have to build various guilds and economic structures in order to grow your kingdom. You decide which buildings to build, which things to upgrade, and how many units to train. The only resource is money, and it is handled either throw your own economy of units buying things at the marketplace to improve their stats, or by building trading posts. Units will interact with buildings by buying better armor, potions, etc. and begin to level up as they face off against creatures that attack you kindgdom. You can manipulate your heroes by assigning reward flags to targets, setting explore flags, or setting defend flags. Each level is designed with a particular objective (kill a target, gather enough gold, defend for x number of days, etc)\n\nThere is lots of unit variety, from rogues, to archers, mages, warriors, and then high level units which have powerful abilities later on in the game. There are also lots of things to upgrade, and many unit combination to explore once you can build inns and form parties. Leveling your units is also satisfying as they learn powerful skills and maul their enemies in the most impressive and satisfying ways. This game is incredibly addicting once you get the hang of it, and missions easily span hours at a time. Graphically the game holds up great and things animate and look reasonably well. There is some nice humour thrown in for good measure with your advisor having a rather amusing sean-connory-like voice. Also your units say random things as they go about their business in your kingdom, so this game has quite a bit of charm. However, I will say that there isn't much of a story, but the mission scenarios feel varied enough with you having to fight all sorts of mystical creatures in intereting ways.\n\nAs far as difficulty, about half way through the game it skyrockets. The premise of the game is to manage to build a starting kingdom with limited resources that can fend off attackers. Once you get comfortable and money starts rolling in you, you can amass a grand army and plow pretty much anything. The issue is that you have to become very clever with where you put guard towers, and were you position your marketplace/guilds. Especially in the later missions, older strategies won't work and you'll have to do a lot of trial and error to figure things out, ie. it almost becomes a puzzle game. This game is definitely not for the faint of heart and it gets really HARD. Reading guides online is sometimes the only way to progress (it's totally frustrating, but also totally worth it once you figure things out). In my case, I couldn't get passed only 2 missions, so I used a hack to get extra money at the start, which is another option to make certain missions more enjoyable.\n\nThis collection comes with 4 games. The original majesty 2, 2 expansions which just add extra missions, and then the Monster Kingdom. The first 2 expansions ramp up the difficulty even more and I recommend staying away from them unless you really like this game. The last expansion swaps your human-like kingdom for a monster-kingom. The difficulty is much better balanced and makes for a better expeience.\n\nIn sum, I have put in 25 hours over the course of 3 days into this game (it is hellishly addicting once you get going). In total there is probably 50+ hours packed into this package. I can heartily recommend giving this game a go, because it's an experience unlike any you've ever had. Just be prepared for the difficulty spike (so use those internets to your advantage).","December 15, 2013","true","25.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/greyhameAU/recommended/73020/","greyhameAU","Greyhame","http://steamcommunity.com/id/greyhameAU/","247 products in account","This is of course a sequel to Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim, just a collection with all the DLC (think expansion packs, not just small additions though there are a few). I recommend picking the original up if you can handle dated graphics, the gold edition is available on Steam as well but that's not what this review is for.\n\nLike the original game you play as the King of Ardania, who with your trusty comedic aide/advisor you build a fairly simplistic kingdom of a market, blacksmith, guardhouses and various guilds to train Heroes. Heroes are the key to this game as they are the characters that will fight your battles and you have the most influence over. Influence is the best word because you cannot directly command them to do anything, just merely suggest they do some tasks by setting bounties (attack, explore, defend) as well as a fear flag which while it isn't a bountie in the true sense, they work on the same mechanics.\n\nThe campaign chronicles the journey to become the undisputed King of Ardania, as time progressed from the first king (from the first game) each king has tried to secure their place in history with grander feats of bravery. Lets just say the last king didn't do so well and you should watch the opening cinematic to see the bravery your forebearers had. The campaign is missioned based and you generally need to complete each mission to progress to the next ones, they generally unlock one or two missions at the same time and for replay value the tutorial is completely optional. Be warned, it does start simple but you do get a large difficulty spike later.\n\nI recommend a Majesty game to anyone who is remotely interested in the premise of the game, this is a worthy sequel but the changes made sort of balance out the improvements made to make it equivalent to the original. The biggest difference from the original (for me) is most heroes will not respond to your bounties quickly unless you put some real money on them, not necessarily a bad thing because it does seem you get more gold income but it can be slightly annoying if you're used to the original. If you want this as an updated version of Majesty you won't be dissapointed, though you may find yourself wanting a bit more.","March 8, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

More realistic than what I would believe a game should be.\n\nInstead of the a-typical select units, tell units to go attack in a flank formation, command mid-battle to turn the tide, etc, etc- it's more of a system to entice your units into what you want them to do. You set a reward on a monster, and then put a bounty on it's head. That is an amazingly cool idea- but in practice it doesn't work out so well.\n\nI had set my flag, and set the bounty to 100. No one would go kill this monster... I set the bounty to 600, nothing. Finally around the 2000 (more than a 1/3 of all the money I had available) mark someone wanted to try it. They promptly died, so one more decided to try it. They died. There isn't really a symbolence of strategy here as I watched each unit die to just one, the very first at that, monster.\n\nAt 4,000 I finally got more than one unit to go and they spent more time running away together than fighting.

Oh, and before I go any further, no, I did not complete the campaign, I'll get to why in a moment. So, without further delay, here is my breakdown of this game.\n\nFirst of all, this game is for masochists, whether you got an unnoficial "balancing mod" or not. This is hands down the most frustrating misuse of a fantastic idea I've ever seen. The idea is pretty great, a fantasy sim city builder that tasks you with managing the kingdom by building and providing incentives for things to get done, all while your heroes do their "best" to rise in level and maybe usefullness. There's also some great voicing, at least on your side, and some pretty cool ideas that actually pan out (such as creating parties), but that's about it.\n\nNow, for the long list of absolutely terrible crap that will continue to make your gaming experience hell. To start with, difficulty, there isn't any way to control this as the game goes from novice to advanced after two missions (read easy to holy hell wtf happened to my town?!) A lot of your completed missions thereafter are based off of luck rather than skill due to enemy spawns and constant zerg-like-rushing. Oh, did I forget to mention that? Yeah, there is absolutely zero room whatsoever for flexible strategy. Thanks to that weird developer minset you'll find that some heroes are just plain worthless, causing you to only waste your gold on their buildings for upgrades. Oh, speaking of gold, enemies don't rely on any kind of resource for whatever unholy reason, and can continue to pump wave after wave at you until you take care of their spawns. This is usually only mildly irratible however, on some later missions, you'll find yourself constantly under pressure or on the brink of ruin merely two or so minutes into a level. So if you like rushing your missions by pumping out the right heroes from the get go without actually taking the time to enjoy the game (read play for more than five minutes per mission) then this is the game for you. If you like to take your time to actually enjoy your purchase, forget this game, seriously just forget it.\n\nSo, if you've actually made it this far in my review and still wish to purchase this game AND don't consider yourself a masochist, I strongly recommend you dowload an unoffical balance mod. The one I used came from this site: "https://esatire.wordpress.com/2012/07/09/majesty-2-is-actually-fun-now-thanks-to-modding/" and it helped me somehow manage to enjoy myself up until a particularly frustrating mission called "Royal Feat". Honestly if game developers design it so that you have to play a fantasy/sim builder/RTS as a juiced up version of Starcraft from zerg-rush hell then they're doing something incredibly, moronically, wrong.\n\nI get way less stress playing the Ikko Ikki on Total War: Shogun 2. And it's far more enjoyable....","January 11, 2015","false","31.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Majesty Golden Expansion was my first game I ever bought.  It was perfect.  You could easily see your characters running about watching them for hours fighting forever against respawning enemies and enemy buildings.  Their voices could be heard either shouting with joy about leveling up or calling out to you about their death.\n\nMajesty 2 is not like Majesty Gold.  You can hardly see the characters, so its hardly fun watching.  Its harder to place buildings.  In the second mission you had to build 3 trading posts, and this is where I found they had copied Age of empires, where you had to build your trading posts in a certain location next to the road.  The one problem was that a house that randomly builds it's self set up right where I needed to build the last trading post.  And unlike Majesty Gold, I couldnt delete the building.... So I had to exit the game and make my review...\n\nThe Majesty 2 has a different map layout, there are now hills and rivers, which conflicts where you are able to lay down buildings.   In Majesty Gold you could click on a character and view evey item it had along with its experience in every stat possible.  You could even click a button that allows you to constantly view the character or building instead of your mini map.  I remember leaving Majesty Gold on for days coming back to see what my Hero's had leveled up to and knowing they could protect my palace and could automatically repawn when needed.\n\nI'd rather stick with Majesty Gold then continue playing an attempted sequel\n\nI may attempt to try this game again, if they decide to try fixing it up.\n\nI think new players may like Majesty 2, mostly becuse they don't know what they are missing, though those who first played Majesty Gold see it differently.","December 3, 2014","false","1.3"," 16 of 36 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","16","36","0","0"

The game calls itself a Fantasy Kingdom simulator, but that's wrong.  Majesty 2 largely lacks the elements of a sim game.  If you're looking for a sim, look elsewhere.\nThis is an RTS.  It applies the same basic principles of RTS games: build buildings, acquire resources, build troops, fight.\nTo the game's credit, though, its RTS mechanics are fairly unique for the genre.\nInstead of commanding troops directly, like you would in Command and Conquer, Starcraft, and to a lesser extent Kohan, you control them by trying to incentivize them.\nSo if you want an enemy destroyed, you post a quest flag on the enemy's base, along with a reward.  Your "heroes" (they are called heroes but they are both as numerous and as functional as troops might be in other RTS games) will then gravitate towards the flag, at a pace depending on the size of the reward offered.\nThere are diffferent kinds of quests to use, and different heroes have different preferences for them.  A ranger hero, for example, prefers exploration quests (basically just removing fog of war from the map, like you might do with an Observer or Zergling in Starcraft), but will still do other quests (with priorities based on reward).\nSo some people might find that interesting.\nUnfortunately, most of the game consists of taking out "lairs."  Lairs are creep spawning buildings littered across the map.  Destroying lairs is important, because it generates revenue (much like in Warcraft III, where destroying as many creeps as possible was crucial to the early game- here, though, the entire length of a game requires you to destroy lairs).  There are many lairs.  The monsters they spawn are relentless.  There is no grace period at the beginning of the game for you to build up your base and army.  It is both difficult and tedious to fend off the constant assaults, while also staging your own attacks against lairs and AI opponents.  Compounding this is the fact that as your base grows, indestructible lairs spawn amongst your buildings.  These are the sewers and cemetaries.  The sewers endlessly spawn hordes of mutant rats (and you will get more than one sewer), and the cemetary spawns constant undead.  These are complete weaklings, and can't be taken care of by the paltry automated defenses available to you.  So you have to devote heroes (and gold, because heroes pretty much never go anywhere without gold) to kill off waves of enemies coming from within your own base as well as without.  This is very tedious.\nYou also have to ensure your heroes' survival, because they need to level up and acquire better equipment.  If they don't, they won't be strong enough to survive.  That's some catch, this catch 22.\nYou can bring in heroes from previous scenarios (these are called Lords), but they are extremely expensive and you can only have a maximum of four.\nThere are no difficulty settings in Majesty 2.  If you're thinking "Well, I can just play on Easy Mode," tough luck,  There isn't one.  There's no downgrading the crapstorm.\nThe story and setting are silly.  The game is intended to be humorous, but I didn't laugh at a single joke.  Maybe it's better in the original Russian, maybe I'm just a joyless git.  Some people find the game hilarious, I'm not one of them.  A staple of the game's humor is the odd take on the fantasy setting, and frequent jabs at the trope.  Barbarians are all Conan-types, complete with Germanic accents.  You never see Dwarven women.  Nearly everything is at least slightly silly.  Might be amusing for some, but not for me.\n\nFor those of you still interested but concerned about the difficulty, there is a fan-made campaign with adjustable difficulty settings out there.  I haven't tried it, and can't speak to its quality.","February 15, 2014","false","10.4"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","10","24","0","0"

A lot of the makings of this game are familiar to anyone who has played any sort of PC RTS game.\n\nIt contrasts harshly, though, with its RTS kin by taking a simulator-approach to control, much more in the camps of Sim City and Tropico than the combat RTSes that you're probably familiar with. This is the primary problem with the game, though. A central, defining mechanic, is that you cannot command units. You can't really command anyone to do anything. Much more like commanding humans in the real world, you can more or less dump breadcrumbs an incentives at objectives, and hope that units will wander along and do your bidding. This works very well in the mentioned simulator titles, because the game's goals are very loosely time-sensitive, and often the challenge you are attempting to defeat is an effeciency quota, or a highscore. It becomes problematic when your objectives are to not be slaughtered by the skeletons that are tearing your castle down.\n\nPlacing a reward miles away from your base at an enemy dungeon is the only way to get adventurers to meander over there and eliminate the threat. But, the amount of response time between placing a reward and your little lemming's arrival is so significant, huge events can occur before one adventurer sets eyes on the lair.\n\nLike, say, an army of skeletons.\nAnd, if this were to occur, I am sure in the real world, a lord would just recall his lair-bounty in favor of base defense. Well, no such luck. Even dumping a larger pot of gold at on your doorstep doesn't seem to help, so often you will encounter odd situations like the destruction of your base, as you watch your would-be defenders weakly beating goblins in the woods somewhere.\n\nI am sure that these problems could be overcome with proper diligence, stragety, and patience, portioning miniscule rewards for objectives and just waiting their completion out. But, when exploring the game's mechanics and worlds, Majesty 2 tends to respond to any sort of failure with slow, plodding frustration, and the rewards for playing effectively feel so anticlimactic that after a very short period of time, I couldn't take anymore. I dumped all my gold in the woods; The skeletons can have my castle.","November 25, 2013","false","0.6"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","7","20","0","0"

Hard game = requires lots of skill. However, some games that should be relatively easy are actually quite hard. It could be due to shoddy programming, bugs, or poor implementation of gameplay elements, etc but which has nothing to do with the player's or AI's skills. This is fake difficulty." -Tv Tropes\n\nI've posted that because I believe this game fits the description, mostly poor implementation of gameplay. The jist of the game is build buildings -> hire heores -> defend kingdom -> complete quest. However you have no direct control over the units like an RTS, you can however, 'influence' your units, hence the title Majesty. The king doesn't get his hands dirty because he shouldn't have to, however can issue orders, place bounties, etc.\n\nExamples\n1) I order the construction of a guard tower at location X, i dont control which worker will build it, but it will be built by one of them.\n2) I need the map expored, after building a guild building that supplies me with Rangers (noted to favor exporation). I can post a exploration marker and set a reward to incentivse them to complete the task. Which ranger (if i have multiple) will do it i have no control over, all i can do increase the reward to get someone to do it.\n\nNO DIRECT CONTROL, you would think the developers would take this into account, as no direct control means you are entirely reliant on the AI sending the right worker (hopefully the nearest) if you're on the clock to get something built fast. They failed in this and it's what really makes the game unplayable.\n\nThe biggest offender is "The Rat King" Mission in the default campaign. Enemy spawns come from structres around the map that your heroes can destory, there are two regular ones near your starting location, and 4 mission specific ones that cannot be destroyed, yet this is not what makes this mission infuriating. Before you are able to complete your first building you are hit with a massive attack form said 4 mission enemy spawning structures who will kill your workers & buildings before anything can be completed to hire Heores (or build guard towers) to defend you lands. In short: You are not even given a chance to defend yourself.\n\nPersonal: I have attempted that mission multiple times, trying all guides and strategy, nothing works. There are even some community concenus that the enemies spawn at faster than displayed rate when using the speed up feature. So going fast = overwhelmed where you'd normally be fine. (and yes i have tried not using the speed up on that mission, the end result is the same)\n\nDo not buy this game, do not support the production of games with such irresponsible gameplay design.","October 6, 2014","false","6.7"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","0"

Though challenging, after suffering many reloads, I still think that this game is well worth the effort.\n\nIt's not your typical RTS/Sim for reasons you've probably read in other reviews. You are literally on 'the outside', a meagre - yet godly - influence on events which occur in your high fantasy domain, controlling heroes and building  constructions from the clouds above.\n\nBut rest assured your choices either make it or break it!\n\nA truly unique game which I will enjoy for many hours yet.

I give some hints in this recommendation, may help u a lot on your way\n\nIf u love challenging strategy games, this is your choice!\n\nthe gameplay is quite unique, since you cant control your heroes (units) directly, you have to use your signal flags as often as you can\n\nI played this game some years ago, i buyed the Majesty 2 Collection with all 3 dlcs\nthe main-campaign is about 10-15 hours, depends on how fast you continue and how often u may fail!\nall in all i got around 30-35 hours to complete all campaigns. There are still a lot of "scenario"-maps\n\nSince this game is very challenging, there are some fast hints for u:\n\n- use your flags a lot, since they are your only way to get some controll over your heroes! they also give some money to your heroes, they need it!\n- invest in your heroes, seriously, they grow stronger and stronger the more you feed them with signal-flags\n- if you dont know what heroes to choose as your "lords", you can hire 3 in every game, and "save" 1 per game, i recommend you to get Thiefs! Thiefs are your key to win! Try to get at least 2 high-lvld thiefs with some awesome equipment, they are extremely cheap. High lvld they almost never die and they are badass killing the most units 1v1! And they have Stun!\n- Since every hero fits into his own role "warrior = tank" "assasin - melee-dps" "Ranger = ranged-dps, good against animals" "cleric=healer, undead-killer" "mage= ranged-dps, AOE-monster" it seemes to be pretty good to get at least 1 guild of all kind. It is, BUT:\n\nhere is where the math comes in: dont worry, i do the math for u ;)\n\nif you afford a Ranger-Guild, it costs you 450 Gold, if you get a second Ranger guild it gets more expensive = 650 gold\nu can Upgrade the ranger-Guild 2 times, 250 gold and 500 gold = 750 gold\nthere are at all 3 Skill-Upgrades, 200 gold + 1k + 1k makes 2200 Gold\nall in all, all Ranger-Upgrades costs u a total of around 2950 Gold!\n\n2950 Gold - 200 gold from the increased guild-cost = 2750 Gold you SAVE with your 2. Ranger-Guild. Thats a whole lot of money! u can also get a 3. Ranger guild and still save an additionall ~ 2500 Gold\n\nU only have to upgrade 1 Ranger-Guild to improve ALL your Rangers!\nSame with all other guilds\n\nMages=there are one of the most awesome dps-monsters in this games, a high-lvld mage can kill groups of strong enemys, mostly single-handed! But its really hard to get them strong and ofc they are pretty expensive\nif u decide to get mages, get them very early in game, and lvl them to lvl 5 as soon as possible!! with lvl 5 they get a mana-shield which makes them much Stronger\nI also recommend to have at least 1 high-lvld mage as a Lord\n\nhere we go\n\nGood Luck & Have Fun guys! :)","May 5","true","34.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
