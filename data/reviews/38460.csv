It is a nonglycosylated protein, composed of two domains held by disulfide bridges. It is a developmentally important retinoic acid-responsive gene product strongly induced during mid-gestation, hence the name midkine . Restricted mainly to certain tissues in the normal adult, it is strongly induced during oncogenesis, inflammation and tissue repair.\n\nMDK is pleiotropic, capable of exerting activities such as cell proliferation, cell migration, angiogenesis and fibrinolysis. A molecular complex containing receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase zeta (PTPζ), low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1), anaplastic leukemia kinase (ALK) and syndecans is considered to be its receptor.\n\nThis is the sequel to that.","March 4, 2014","true","4.7"," 55 of 87 people (63%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","63","55","87","14","10"

Now let's get to the details :P\n\nThis game is a TPP puzzle platformer. You take control (simultaneously) over 3 characters: Kurt, mechanical dog Max and genius doctor Hawkins. Each character has completely different playstyle and emphasis on certain mechanics (Kurt - sniper rifle, parachute, lots of platforming, Max - less platforming, but can handle 4 firearms (!), Doctor - solving puzzles using some of his weird, science gear (atomic toaster for example :P). The goal is the usual one - save the earth against aliens :P\n\nWhat else? Great humour, likable characters, goofy enemies, massive and colorful locations, kick ♥♥♥ music, epic boss battles, really funny cutscenes, unforgettable missions, cartoonish graphics that didn't age at all... But the best thing about MDK2 is that it feels really light and fun :)\n\nSo if you haven't played this game yet, I would strongly recommend picking it up.

(was gonna get Fur Fighters but that didn't happen) I actually beat this game growing up, maybe spending more than 20 hours playing it.\nLooking back now, and currently STRUGGLING to beat Kurts second level I don't see how I did it as a kid. The game does have it's difficult moments but nothing too hard. Literally probably only Kurt's second level (you'll see what part when you get to it)\nBecause of crap like that I do miss the checkpoints instead of having to save my own my own when I find a safe area.\n\nHaven't played with keyboard yet but the Xbox controller having like an EXTREMELY similar mapping/design to the DC controller made it SUPER easy to adjust... just didn't like having to map things myself (but I'm just lazy)\nSadly partial controller support I believe is a thing so (RB and LB) v (LT and RT) you'd have to go with buttons because If youre jumping and shooting with the triggers cancelling an action is going to happen... so its choosing one or the other. That seeming to be my only controller issue... sensitivity varies from player to player on analog.\n\nThe game's story is wacky and comical, something I find enjoyable but probably a bit too wacky and corny even as I was growing up.\nA great ending to a great story with none of that twist crap but let me shut my mouth before i start spoiling\n4/5","April 6, 2014","true","9.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","1"

I loved MDK1 and, while it wasn't as good, MDK2 has only gotten good reviews. Hell, Bioware worked on this one so how terrible could it be? VERY terrible, as the case happens to be. The controls are easy to get used to even if you haven't played before, but the main issue with this game isn't the gameplay, the issue is with the multitude of game-breaking bugs. When I first started playing, everything seemed to be fine and dandy. Then the controls started to stick when I moved around. At first this wasn't an issue, but when I couldn't jump while running towards a cliff or my character just decided to run into an alien's crotch and run in place until I lost half of my health, I began to get rather cross.

Don't worry about not playing the first one, you can pick this game up and play it without any problem as the first game was MUCH more lax on the story side of things.  This game is the definition of what it means to be a classic.  As is often the case with Bioware games, the writing is fantastic with comedy being seamlessly interweaved with the high-paced action game that it is.  The level designs do not lack for anything.  They really make you think since every room is like its own puzzle.  I remember when I was young, around 9 or 10, I would be stuck on some rooms for days before my tiny brain put together what I needed to do.  This was an era before I was even aware I could google game walkthroughs, but I loved figuring everything out.  The boss fights are epic, with each boss seeming like a more complex Legend of Zelda boss fight.  Finally, what REALLY sets this game apart for me is the sheer amount of secrets in the game.  This game is from a time when designers could throw in a secret room you accessed by stumbling across an invisible bridge over a never-ending pit or running towards a section of wall that seems slightly off-color from the rest.  They reward you with items, health, or perhaps a joke room with a poorly photoshopped picture of the developers' faces over some cartoon characters.   Either way, these secret rooms do not detract anything from the experience, and they're a real treat to find.  This is a game that does not hold your hand and try to steer you to progress.  No, this game sits and waits for you to progress, expecting you to know what to do or to take as much time as you need to figure it out.","August 24, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They were better than the PC version for one tiny simple fact. The graphics weren't as dark. Other than that the graphics were exactly the same between all three platforms and so were the controls and playability. Now I have beaten this PC version, it's just 98% of the time I'm in off-line mode because I don't have internet access where I live so with Steam I'm usually only on it to download the games and I've very apearently played this one for more than 12 minutes. Found out to my surprise writting a review on a game I've beaten from Steam on off-line mode I couldn't post because I've only played it a minute. Well that's a good laugh. On-line now because my system got factory reset and now have to redownload all my steam games. Man this is gonna take weeks. If you ever played MDK 2 on any of the other systems, the PC version is exactly the same except a little too dark which is dulling a beautiful game that is doing alot with it's grapics with surprising low memory. I was surprised how little this game took off my hard drive and yet it looks this good?!? Better yet this is also an awesome game too, well except when I play the Doctor but two out of three isn't bad as you count Maxx and Kirt. Be a sniper or a robotic dog with four arms, each loaded with a gun for massive firepower. The humor on this game is killer too. If you never heard of this game before, do yourself a favor and take a chance on this hidden gem, very likely you wont regret it.","July 1, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Better than the first one, in my opinion. A lot more of a puzzle-solving adventure, since you control two new characters, each either their own unique talents.\nI need to play this game again to refresh my memory, but I seem to recall fond memories of the Doctor with a toaster.","January 9, 2012","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great piece of work all around; way ahead of its time in many aspects. Make sure you buy the original version, not the HD remake.","December 27, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
