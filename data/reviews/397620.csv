Unfortunately, the game is plagued by a combination of slippery controls and no undo button. Slippery controls aren't an issue with undo, and lack of undo isn't a problem with tight controls.  When a game has both, it crosses the line from fun to frustrating very quickly.\n\nI played the first 15 levels, and none of the puzzles took more than a couple seconds to find the solution. Executing always took much longer than it should have.\n\nIf you can get past the slippery controls, this could be a fun little game, especially for the price. As it is, that was a dealbreaker for me.","October 7, 2015","false","0.2"," 61 of 71 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","61","71","0","1"

I cannot recommend it, though. It is supposed to be a puzzle game, Sokoban-style, but the puzzles are really easy to solve logically. The idiotic thing is that this is compensated for by the player being required to solve them really, really fast.

They just released GooCubelets 2 only two months after releasing the first one, instead of updating the first game. And here's their third game a month and a half after the second!\n\n4 / 10 - It's not worth more than the $1 they're asking for.\nPros:\nIt's easy to control the cube(s).\nSome good puzzles, they can get slightly difficult.\n50 puzzles.\nLets you choose which monitor to run the game on, resolution, overall quality and windowed mode.\nRebindable inputs, although it doesn't detect gamepads.\nSome physics, but the results are completely static.\nCons:\nDoesn't currently support gamepads, but you could use a third-party program such as Joy2Key or XPadder.\nMusic gets repetitive, isn't great. Just mute it and listen to something else.\nThe background on everything is pure white. It's blinding and very obnoxious. Trying to figure out puzzles while being blinded by the white background is not pleasant. There isn't a dark alternative and I highly recommend they make one.\nThe timer for individual levels starts while fading into the stage. There's no brief pause before beginning, meaning it could be hard to see where you're going at first if you're trying to get a good time.\nBronze, Silver and Gold medals for individual levels have ridiculous cutoffs. Gold usually being close to frame-perfect execution with the best solution, and Bronze isn't far behind.\nNo Steam achievements, even though all of your individual level medals are tracked on a page called "Achievements." There could be a few at least, such as getting Gold on every level, Silver or Bronze. Beating every level, or one for every 10 levels, etc..\nCan't rebind inputs in-game.\nCan't modify display settings in-game.\nIt doesn't tell you how to play or even what keys to use. You'll have to check the input settings before launching the game.\nLevel 29 introduces another height level as well as controlling more than one color cube. This level can be very confusing at first, because nothing is explained. Basically if you let the red cube fall from the upper level(which you usually do on the first move), you have to restart, but you may not realize it was ever up there to begin with, because it usually falls on the first move. Hell, it still doesn't make any sense when you figure that out.\nUpdate: (Quote from developer)\nXbox 360 controller support added\nYou can now rebind inputs\nInstructions added in levels 1,2 and 29I've bumped up my rating from 5.5 to 6.\nAnd another update: I bumped the 6 down to 4 and no longer recommend the game because instead of updating this one, they released a second game only two months later!","September 4, 2015","false","1.1"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","9"

The levels are timed and the main reason it's difficult to get a good time is due to the clunkiness of moving the cubelet around.  Cubelets get stuck if they end up next to a wall - they have to be at least one space away to be able to move.  It felt like an arbitrary limitation created to make the game challenging rather than a logical bit of physics.\n\nI didn't like the game but it's inexpensive so if you llike timed puzzles, you may want to give it a try.

SpaceChem is still my favorite puzzle game but this comes a close second. I'll definitely replay it every now and then.\n\nVery clever puzzle game. It kinda looks like Sokoban but plays very different. As its key mechanic you have a one square gap between the pushing and the pushed block. If you're right next to another block you cannot push it. This leads to puzzles where you cannot move cubes along seemingly obvious paths because at some corner they don't leave you the two empty squares you need for the next push\n\nPros:\nThree clever game mechanics (the standard gap push described above, pusher flock, second level with gap walking). Except for the trick needed for level 30 they are all self explanatory or well explained\nA good variety of puzzles\nThe jelly effect rocks. I also like the general art style, with the white background, bright colors and the pretty unique soundtrack\nGood challenge level, the game requires you to think without ever getting aggravatingly hard (unlike e.g. RUSH, where the last few levels are for masochists)\nVery low price. If it had cost 3€ ( instead of 1€ ) I'd still have felt I got my money's worth\nCons:\nNeeds more levels :)\nLevel 30 really needs a hint text about the move you need to solve it. Without a hint from KipofMudd I would never have stumbled across it, it's just too counter-intuitive to normal physics think\nNoticable lack of an undo button, leads to time sink situations when you try to experiment (level 30, I'm looking at you). Would take the fun out of level 50, so please no undo button on that level","September 10, 2015","true","4.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","4"

Its a white background which generally is hurting my eyes after awhile.\nOptions is very hard to read due the white backgrounds and Color text.\nThere is a Volume control. 0 to 5.\nThe music is annoying after awhille and i do recommend to turn this off.\nThere are only in-game achievements not Steam achievements.\nYou are able to play this game with a controller.\n\nAbout the game.\nYou a blob of Goo/Jelly and you have to push a blue block into a square. You are moving the blue block if you are moving to the block next to him. You can't push the block if you are standing next to him already.\n\nThe Music in the game is getting annoying after awhile.\nThere are in-game achievements But these are only time based.\nThere are Time based challenges.. However these "Time challenges" Seems to be nearly impossible to beat on Gold.\nThe background is white which could be hurtful for the eyes.\nThere is No in-game sound, only Music.\nThere is a Retry/Restart button on the level.\nIf you press ESC, The game will NOT BE PAUSED! You can still move and the timer is still ticking.\nThere are 50 levels... So if you wish to become blind i will recommend you to beat them all (on gold if possible).\n\nOther things.\nLike all other games these developers has made. This game is bad and garbage aswell.\nI will not recommend this at all.\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 1/10","January 17","false","3.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Completing the levels as quickly as possible is best. Try to buy GooCubelets when it is in your price range.\n\nDisclaimer: As of this writing, I've played GooCubelets once and I've  only played up to level 14, so I'm not sure what mechanics might be introduced later on.\n\nMy opinion regarding GooCubelets' good and bad elements...\nThe good:\npuzzle game with jiggly jelly cubes\nmusic is pretty good. I did not find it distracting or unpleasant.\nprice was very low when I bought it on sale\ninteresting mechanics: to move a cube, you move your green gummi cube toward the cube from two squares away, which will bounce the cube over one square.\nbronze, silver, and gold awards for each level!\nchallenging!\nThe not so good:\none wrong move and the level must be restarted\nmechanics take some getting used to: to move a cube away from the edge of the board, it has to be at least two squares away from the edge\nthe time required to get even the bronze award is half as many seconds as what seemed like a fast run to me\nmusic changes are relatively infrequent.\nthe camera takes some getting used to and is still suboptimal for some things\nbronze, silver, and gold awards for short times on each level! However, each requires meeting or beating a preset time.\nUser Interface is awkward, but charming in its presentation.\nchallenging!\nI recommend this game if you enjoy pushing colored gummi cubes around, enjoy puzzle games, enjoy finding the optimal path to get the fastest time, and/or enjoy challenges.\n\nIf you lose your temper easily, meditation might be a good way to clear and calm your mind before you take on the challenge that is GooCubelets.","September 7, 2015","true","1.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","2","5","2","0"

I too similar the full general fine knack style, amongst the white background, brilliant colors together with the handsome unique soundtrack\nGood challenge level, the game requires yous to intend without e'er getting aggravatingly difficult (unlike e.g. RUSH, where the terminal few levels are for masochists)\nVery depression price. If it had toll 3€ ( instead of 1€ ) I'd yet cause got felt I got my money's worth\n\nCons:\nNeeds to a greater extent than levels :)\nLevel thirty actually needs a hint text virtually the act yous remove to solve it. Without a hint from KipofMud I would never cause got stumbled across it, it's only besides counter-intuitive to normal physics think\nNoticable lack of an undo button, leads to fourth dimension sink situations when yous endeavour to experiment (level 30, I'm looking at you).

The gameplay was lacking, and I felt like the controls were "wobbly". As for the soundtrack, it was a forgettable loop that seemed to be "stalled" on a single appregio. 10 levels in and the difficulty curve seemed rather "inconsistent".

The mechanics work well, and the visuals are decent.  However, I just didn't find it engaging enough to keep me playing beyond the first several levels.  I just got bored pretty quickly.  You can easily reset a level by the back button on an xbox 360 controller, or the reset icon on upper-right if using a mouse.  I preferred keyboard controls best, rather than the D-pad on my controller, but was a little ackward to click with the mouse to reset or hit the back button on the nearby controller.  But levels are short and fairly easy to repeat from start if you make a mistake.  Still, an undo move button might have kept me engaged longer, but isn't a deal breaker.\n\nRan fine on my Windows 10, Alienware Alpha running full screen on my 47" TV.

Not worth the money, no matter how much or little it is and the developers need to learn what QA is and DO IT. I give this game a 2/10 because I could move the cubes, but the controls were sloppy, and if I was right up against the cube it doesn't move on top of no undo button. so if you get the cube against a wall? you are screwed.\n\nas of right now, I would say this game is in beta stage, but should be in alpha to add more interactivity.","February 19","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay was lacking, and I felt like the controls were "wobbly". As for the soundtrack, it was a forgettable loop that seemed to be "stalled" on a single appregio. 10 levels in and the difficulty curve seemed rather "inconsistent". This is a game that won't be "Sticking" with me. Sorry about all these "GOOd" puns I made.","May 13","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has an awesome concept, but it gets ruined by the controls and repititivity (is that how you spell it?) I know its express done so it can annoy you, but it just annoys too much and completing a level doesn't give that satisfaction. It just doesn't feel good.","May 4","false","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Keeps making me stuff and and ultimately ruins the game. Can't change graphics in-game\n- Controls not really that sensitive, makes the game more challenging though\n- Music gets repetitive\n- Basically impossible to get a medal, timing is too punishing\n\nWould recommend it if it didn't keep ripping","May 18","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
