Meaning that, because reaction speeds are slower with a mouse (in particular to click a very specific region) compared to quickly tapping with a finger, that it'll take longer to actually point at something. Not to mention that the skill buttons are clickable with the mouse, meaning that if the fight takes place in the lower regions of the screen, that you'll often click them by accident.\n\nBut what of the Gameplay itself? Sadly, as it stands now, it's basically a hack-and-slash, giving you three stamina-using skills to use, a dash and a regular weak attack. Spamming these special attacks quickly drains your stamina, which will cause you to be temporarily stunned if said bar is completely depleted.\n\nWhile you have the choice of one of three characters, you get the other two as soon as youÂ´ve beaten about five bosses. These AI seem to be well capable of just spamming their own skills, but the enemy tends to have a preference for you anyway. Meaning you'll still be well busy keeping yourself alive.\n\nAnd that's it. Tap to move or double tap to dash out of the way of an attack, keep laying on the heat and you're set. The character buttons that possibly serve to further define or gear up your character are "not available yet". So we're obviously dealing with a Tablet port that also serves to just give a taste of what's to come, as the loading screens love to wave around that the actual release is dated for December.\n\nThere are no graphics options to speak of. No resolution options, either. Let alone anything else. Alt-Enter works to switch between Fullscreen and Windowed, but that wasn't said anywhere.\n\n\nHonestly? Unless the developers make some changes that clearly embrace the PC market or simply make it friendlier for them, I would avoid this game. EVEN IF ITS 3 DOLLARS.\n\nTake my opinion for what you will, but I say that this has a lot of fixing ahead of it before I can consider it well playable.\n\nUPDATE\nLet's clarify this: If you start asking money for it, it stops being a Beta and becomes a release. If you don't want your game judged that way, then don't ask money for it or don't release it yet.\nThe page also does not clarify the true nature of this game, as it being a 'preview' or a taste of a product to come.\n\nThis is not a practise we should condone. It's just milking money from people.","November 7, 2014","false","0.9"," 84 of 104 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","84","104","0","7"

The game boils down to Monster Hunter boss fights and boss fights only.\nThere is no way to power up your character other than grinding for levels.\nDon't get me wrong I had my fun with the game. The first 20 minutes when you start the game are kinda fun.\nCombat, bosses and music is good, but when you are forced to fught same boss 5 times just with diferent skin it gets boring. After some time it juste feels like some chore.\nAttack>Attack>Attack>Roll>Use specials>Attack>Roll>Attack untill you have stamina for special>Attack>Boss Dead.\nLater on it becomes even more boring cause they encrease the enemy health.\n\nFirst time you fight robotic T-Rex:\nGame: Hey you will now fight robotic T-Rex\nMe: Ow yeah. Bring it on.\nGame: You won!\nMe: that was cool fight and music was nice.\n\nSecond time you fight robotic T-Rex:\nGame: Hey you will now fight robotic T-Rex2.0\nMe: Oh ok. Bring it on?\nGame: You won!\nMe: that was re-skin of a previous boss.\nGame: Yeah but this one used laser that you easly dodged.\n\nSeventh time you fight robotic T-Rex:\nGame: Hey you will now fight robotic T-Rex again now with x5 HP and randomly shooting bombs\nMe: Realy?\nGame: You won!\nMe: Yeah after failing 3 times cause timer run out before I was able to deliver finishing strike.\n\nYou can see where am I getting at later on timer becomes the boss.\nSo after all that is this game worth 2â¬.

I would honestly think that this game is wel worth it's price even if it's not updated (which I trully hope it does get updated, to atleast support MP[only SP atm]), and there is a statifying feeling of getting through the bosses then face rolling them & getting S ranks :P  (not sure if higher ranks are available, I assume not but I could be wrong)\n\nThis isn't a game I would suspect most to just sit for hours & play, but given some Keymapping to a controller, & Steam streaming.. I could easily see this being loads & loads of fun to see who can do better & such.\n\nI had the hardest time with the butcher, & it was mostly only due to time issues (5 minute kill window for each boss), though I suspect the camera & inability to aim my weapon @ first contributed to that.  [being the only boss so far I had to restart a few times for running out of time]\n\nIf the price was higher, I would not recommend this game, but as it stands it's worth the 2$ USD, and you could honestly do alot worse then this.\n\nI wouldn't expect controller support & it doesn't claim to have it.   There isn't much to the RPG elements, outside auto leveling, & some locked elements to the characters.

However the PC is really the wrong platform for this game and you will very quickly yearn for more depth in your gameplay, a story, some better sense of progression, and this game is not the one to deliver it. Still might be worth adding to your library if you get it in a bundle or for very cheap for a quick relief of your hack and slash itch\n","October 3, 2015","true","1.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

After the first set of missions, you get the other two classes added to your team, at which point you can switch your hero between the three of them and start battling against other fighters as well as bigger monsters.

That's cheap.

However, they converted this over to PC, keep this in mind before you buy it and Thumbs Down it.\n\nPros:\n-Cute chibi style graphics.\n-Unique bosses and stages.\n-Destinctly different characters.\n\nCons:\n-Uses unchangable UJIO controls.\n-There is no tutorial\n_________________________________\nOverall:\n_________________________________\n\nThis game needs some work before it's "Awesome" or "Great", but it's not a bad 2$ game for PC.\nI think if they just added the ability to change the control key setup, this game would be loads more fun, the UJIO is wonky and unnatural. Besides that, though, it's a fun game to play when you're bored and are tired of dying constantly in Dark Souls.\n\nWould I recommend this? Yes, yes I would. You see, World 2 (Boss hunter) is up for some BIG updates- PvP, new characters, etc. When this update happens, this game will be really exciting!

I only paid a buck for it and I feel so ripped off, this game isnt even worth the bandwith to download the 300 megs if it weas free.  If you're smart youll PASS this with a quickness! â¥â¥â¥â¥ GAME!\n\nThis is by far the worst attempt at a money grab scam ive ever seen a failed mobile game being sold as a PC made game and put on steam to boot. They are lowering their standards so low its going to be impossible to buy a good trustworthy game on steam if this keeps up , its bad enough as it is but this is a whole new low.","December 18, 2014","false","0.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Good game to play when you have some time to kill. Movement controlls are a tiny bit wonky but the game flows well and isn't too taxing.","December 18, 2014","true","0.3"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"
