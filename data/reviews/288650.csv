They finally added it. XBox 360 Controller Support has been added and the game has become so much more playable. Being able to use the right trigger on a controller has the same feeling of actually playing with slot cars. They have fixed bugs in the level creator as well. My first review of this game was "Not Recomended" but I have decided to re-write it and and change my stance on it now that I can actually enjoy the game.\n\nIf you're a fan of slot cars at all, Youre gonna love this game. It's the only sim of this kind and has the physics that make it feel realistic. There are several modes to play in even a track editor so you can make all those crazy tracks you never could as a kid. Plus you don't have to pick it all up after you're done playing! You can upload your tracks for other people to try and Download tracks that others have made, and people make some crazy stuff. You can customize your car and unlock several others as well. The graphics are kinda what you would expect from a game like this. Kinda cartoonish but it suits the stye of game. High FPS all around and no crashes or bugs that I have found.\nI do recommend this game and the price I think is fair for what the game has to offer.\n\n8/10 Best Slot car Sim","June 2, 2014","true","1.8"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","29","32","0","8"

It has the sound and feel down plus a lot of the recognizable cars from my youth are recreated without the licensing. The only negative to the game is that you use the mouse to adjust the throttle (by clicking and dragging a notch on a powerbar). It works but the trigger of a controller would be much more natural and there is no option for it unfortunately. In fact, this is so much fun that I wish they offered a USB classic slot controller to use with the game. While this is an extreme nostalgia niche, I think they will find a loyal audience and I hope they open up Steamworks so people can mod in their own favorite content like favorite car bodies and glow in the dark track sections, zero G cars and the track accessories like lap counters, timers, cops and robbers sets, etc. $12 to revisit my youth and remember many good times with my brother is absolutely worth it. Thank you devs for something original and polished pretty well considering this Early Acess cashin world we are living in.","June 5, 2014","true","0.2"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","17","31","0","0"

If you buy the best wires, then the best chassis, you'll be able to win easy and normal mode always at full speed. No need to play with the throttle. And in hard mode, it's almost unplayable because of the high speed and the camera. I still recommend it at discount price.","March 2, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It could have been a better game but for those of us that still love slot cars there aren't many games to chose from.  The track editor is a glitchy piece of trash though.\n\nThe game is much like real slot racing.  He who has the best tires and can maintain a higher average speed usually wins.  The good news is that you never have to replace pins and runners.  No more messing with brushes and springs.  That being said, I would still rather play with real slot cars but it's nice to play a decent video game version for a change.","December 23, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But I do think they really should have left the word simulation out of the title, further than that it is pretty much arcade-ish.\n\nControls?\nI use my mouse to play it and my mouse only.\n\nRecommend it?\nYes, buy when it is on sale, I did the same.","December 20, 2014","true","0.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Getting the fastest motor just makes it impossible to keep track of your car and learn when to max and not. I can't even imagine how a different body makes the car better, but it does. Oh there's unlockable cars too, and they're terrible compared to yours.\n\nThe track editor is broken to all hell, crashes when you try to make a piece of track any higher than 75 degrees incline since it can't even think how to decorate it so no Wipeout fantasies here. Of course the community creations are bombarded with awful tracks and there's no way of even competing for the best times.\n\nHonestly, it's just not good at all. There aren't very many slot car sims out there but, this is one not to get.","May 3, 2015","false","1.0"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","4","11","2","0"

First off, it's fun. Single player mode offers some neat tracks and they have interesting scenery as well for slot cars. My wired xbox controller works great (feels just like a slot car trigger) but the mouse can be used with some success as well.\n\nTriple screens work fine for me, albeit in 768p, no 1080x5760 available for 3 monitors - still the game looks good. I've played through novice mode which was preetty easy once i got the hang of it, but the good news is medium and advanced have all new tracks! I should note some of the menus were a bit scrambled in 3 monitor mode - not the most intuitive interface but i was able to do what i needed to do.\n\nThe track editor works, but was a bit aggravating to use. I still managed to complete a large track and share it.\n\nThe music is great! If you are a modern metal fan you'll enjoy it, and even if not it suits the subject matter well.\n\nOverall for $20 i'd say this is worth it - fun little game, fun to watch, my son enjoys sitting with me while we play this. Its a little rough around the edges, but in the end works as advertised and has a nice fun factor. I highly recommend the xbox controller to get the real life slot car feel - can't comment on the wireless one not working, but the wired xbox controller just worked - i plugged it in, started the game, fired up a race and the trigger worked to control the car's juice.","October 18, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
