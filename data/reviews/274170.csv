It's the moment you turn off your brain and go crazy ... and succeed. I mean, at the start of every game I play very careful and stealthy, plan out my moves and execute my actions with precision. But then I get killed by some stupid mistake. I lose my patience and go mad, I rush into a room and just move without a plan or purpose, I'm just "in the moment", almost at a state of mindless meditation. Then I come back to my senses and realize the room is a bloodbath and every one is dead ... except me and the red arrow that invites me to the next section.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=438245604 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=633316069 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=438247014","April 29, 2015","true","39.1"," 277 of 293 people (95%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","95","277","293","42","6"

In this game, melee combat was somewhat nerfed, making the melee swing slower and the and the range smaller.\n\nOne of the most controversial characteristics of Hotline Miami 2 is its relatively large cast of playble characters. But Haplop, how could more characters equal less fun.\nWell for starters you have more characters but less unique playstyles. There are 27 masks each with their unique gimmicks and playstyles opposed to the 14 characters of Hotline Miami 2. Whats more is that there most characters dont add anything new, here's whats new.\nFists of Fury,(used by 2 different characters), lethal punches, cant pick up any weapons, wich renders it sorta useless since the levels are so big.\nDodge Roll,(used by 2 different characters) you press space to dodge in the direction you are pointing and become invincible in the mean time, can sometime cause you to miss floor executions.\nChainsaw and Guns,(unique) you control one of 2 sibllings wich (the one rocking the chainsaw), with your right mouse button you force the second sibling to shoot. The AI on the second sibling can be kinda buggy, and will sometimes become stuck behind walls while you charge inside a room full of mobsters armed to the teeth with nothing but a chainsaw.\nTwo machine guns, (used by 2 different characters) you start with 2 smgs, you can have 64 bullets and can only reload once, after that, there is nothing special to it.\nStart with a nailgun,(unique)- 24 nails, silent killer, nothing out of the ordinary.\nInner warrior,(unique) Fists of Fury with nunchucks.Remember the Richter and Aubrey mask from the previous game? They now grant no special abilities.\nThere is also a character wich instead of killing can incapacitate and disarm foes for bonus points.\nYou also get to play as a soldier wich can switch between a knife and one of for weapons ( a rifle, a shotgun, a sniper rifle and a flamethrower) but cant pickup any other weapons.\n\nThe soundtrack is just downright beautiful featuring the works of El Huervo, M|O|O|N, Perturbator and many other independent artists, it can go from slow and melancholic to full on assault in seconds and it really does not only live up to the standards set by the previous game but somehow also manages to surpass them by a pretty big stretch.\nNot only that but the audio in general is really descriptive and the mushy sound of grey matter splattering all over the room does add to the gory factor of the game, wich by the way, makes great use of the Hitchcock effect (google it)\nThe sprites may seem a bit, how should I put it, wonky (?) at first but after playing through it you realize that it is one of the best way to convey to the player the setting of Miami's 1980's.\n\nOverall the game in itself is great, the gameplay isnt as satisfying as that of the 1st game but the story is beautifully written. Its a much more down-to-earth game and the story always has you feeling sorrowful and melancholic while still keeping you interested and engaged as you watch this immensely dense plot unravel before your eyes while you cant really do anything about it.\nI guess that that is what really gives you a sense of accomplishment, once you manage to get the bigger picture that is.\nSo...\n\nDo you still like hurting other people?\n\nLet me know if you agree with this review or not.","September 14, 2015","true","29.3"," 275 of 291 people (95%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","95","275","291","17","9"

The original game was about a masked serial killer who got mysterious phone calls threatening him into carrying out hits on mob locations. The whole story was pretty strange and trippy, with very little being what it seems. The gameplay was super fast and hectic as you ran around scavenging whatever you could find to beat the brains out of the army of mafia waiting in the buildings. The combat was close quarters-oriented with some enemies with guns, but mostly melee focused. Each mask had different abilities that affected your starting weapon, or gave you abilities like killing punches or spawning more guns as random pickups. All in all, it was a fairly good game with all of this.\n\nThe reason why I didn't really like Hotline Miami 1 was because the AI was actually fairly buggy and reacted either very sluggishly or hyper-quickly, without reason. The level design was very tight, and due to the ridiculous speed of everything, it felt too hard to control. I would finish a level and feel like I'd gotten lucky.\n\nHotline Miami 2 managed to fix a fair amount of the problems with the first. The combat is slowed down somewhat. Guns  fire slower, melee weapons swing slower, and the level design is more open, allowing some more freedom of movement (the combo meter also lasts longer naturally). The result, in my opinion, is that the gameplay feels much more tight and controlled. The weapons swings feel like they have more weight to them, guns kill much more effectively, and the levels feel less restrictive. However, I've seen a lot of people say that they felt the opposite, and that they were driven more towards using guns because there are more enemies with guns, so melee is now useless. In the same vein, people hated the more open maps because they felt that there was a tendency to get shot from off-screen by an unseen enemy, or through glass.\n\nI would say that Hotline Miami 2 is somewhat less casual than the first, which is why I think so many people feel that it's too hard. I bought both games together, and after I finished 1 I jumped straight into 2. The difficulty spike is noticable; it's been stated by the developers that it was primarily geared towards players who'd played the first game and knew how it worked. That being said, I didn't find it too hard to get into the groove of Hotline Miami 2. I died a ton at the start, and really all the way throughout, but it never felt like I had died due to BS game design, but rather my own mistakes or miscalculations. I think HM2 is meant to be played with a bit more planning in mind. You can rush in and fight, but it doesn't usually go well. However, it's also not like you need to plan your every move. You just need to observe enough that you know what you're about to get into. From there, it gets much easier. I said earlier that I felt like I'd gotten lucky when I'd finished a level in HM1. In HM2, I had felt quite the opposite. In each level, once I knew what I needed to do, I felt like I was much more in control. I finished levels and felt satisfied, without the tinge of anger or the "I just got lucky that time" feeling.\n\nAs for the gameplay problems: There are definitely more guns, and the gameplay is more gun oriented, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that melee play is impossible. To be honest, it felt the opposite in HM1; guns felt out of place, and, in many instances, rather ineffective. I feel like 2 strikes a better balance, even if it seems to favor guns more. Many levels still can be played with melee weapons, it just requires, as I said earlier, some more patience and planning. You just need to know what you're walking into.\n\nAs for the glass panes and off-screen deaths: I've encountered the first, but not the second. There are, once again, more glass panes for enemies to shoot you through that in HM1, but that is always a two-way street: You can just as easily shoot them better as well. As for the off screen deaths, I have almost never, at any moment in HM2, died to an enemy that I COULDN'T have been able to see. What do I mean by this? Well, the camera obviously places the most emphasis on the direction you're facing or trying to look. Whenever I've been killed by an "off-screen enemy", I've really just been killed by one that I couldn't see because I was looking the wrong way, in a sense. It's easier to notice if you look at gameplay of it. The only exception to this are the crouching gun enemies which pop up when the player is in their line of sight, becuase they have a huge sight range for some reason. They alone are the enemies that can kill you before you can see them. I think all of the other enemies have about the same ( or a bit less) of the sight range of the player.\n\nWhat about the more open maps? Well, I'm mixed. Some maps are straight up huge, but they actually aren't that hard to traverse and fight through. Others, particulary Hard News, Blood Money, and Takeover, are unforgivably open, and cannot be played easily without guns (or really at all for Blood Money). But otherwise, as big as some maps are, you can still play through them using melee. Act 5 in particular is a sort of throwback to HM1's more frantic style with somewhat more restricted maps and lots of melee enemies.\n\nThe story of HM2 is also something that some players don't like. I don't want to go into it, because there are some big spoilers, but I will say this: HM2's story is far more lucid than HM1's. It's told in a style which constantly switches characters, which is why it seems harder to comprehend, but it's actually fairly easy to piece together if you're observant. Several characters have stories that directly link to HM1, as the story is anachronistic (is that the word?) and takes place before, after, and during the events of HM1.\n\nAs for the character abilities: HM2 is definitely more restrictive in playstyles than HM1 in some instances. Few characters/factions have the option of different abilities, but those few abilities that do exist are all very unique and varied. There's one character that can do a dodge roll, another can carry two SMGs. Yet another disarms all the guns he picks up, making him more melee based (see?) but can go rage mode if you kill enemies instead of knocking them out. Some characters have no abilities, and those are personally my favorite, because they have the most open and unrestriced gameplay (as some characters are stupidly restrictive, such as the Fans). The soundtrack also rocks, because it's less ambient than the HM1's. In HM2, the soundtrack carries far more weight and fits the scene better, and is never repetitive.\n\nSo that's basically all about Hotline Miami 2 (thanks for sticking around this long). To be honest, The best way to experience this game is to buy it with the first as a combo pack (it only adds $5 to the price of just HM2). That way, you can play both games, experience both playstyles, develop your own opinions, be better prepared for the challenge of Hotline Miami 2, and better appreciate the overall story (which is actually really interesting). That's basically all I have to offer.","April 19","true","154.3"," 223 of 231 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","223","231","4","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/recommended/274170/","rgk","rgk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/","357 products in account","Hotline Miami 2 is closer to the last levels of the first game (Biker) than the rest of Hotline Miami (Jacket and all his masks), and thus feels like a direct continuation rather than just a new coat of paint. This opinion might seem a bit obtuse now, but I will explain later on why it is an important distinction.\n\nSo, why is it a continuation rather than a new take?\n\nWell, at first, the difficulty is brutal right off the bat. This game is aimed at people who already played Hotline Miami 1 and are familiar with the concept of its ultra-violent twitch gameplay associated with tight level design forcing the players to plan their route according to the situations.\n\nAnd then, the playable characters are mostly forced, just like Biker was, and they have an equally narrow skillset. Biker had a hatchet and three knives to throw but could not pick up weapons? Tony from Hotline Miami 2 has his insta-kill fists but is unable to pick up weapons.\n\nThe game moved on from the freedom of choice offered in the majority of Hotline Miami 1, and forces a more controlled experience. This idea goes further, as a lot of levels are designed so tightly that the chaotic action of Hotline Miami 1 has been replaced by puzzles with barely more than one way to solve them.\n\nMoreover, the gameplay is overall less rough around the edges, with more solid surfaces that block bullets, and most especially a seemingly slower speed, I feel more like I have to anticipate every movement rather than play on the fly and let my instincts and skills take over. More 'slow', less 'flow'.\n\nSo here I come to the point that I made at the start: Hotline Miami 2 feels like a more controlled experience as a direct continuation to the Biker levels, rather than the early levels with their chaotic sandbox design that allowed for a much wider variety of approaches.\n\nHowever, enough Hotline Miami 2 levels are not so tight and can offer variety, and  a lot of missions offer a choice between different characters or weapons. So the game still does a good job at offering variety. My observation is just that the variety feels forced, rather than the sweet spot and perfect flow that I felt Hotline Miami 1 achieved.\n\nHotline Miami 2 is more polished that the first one. Way more polished. The levels, atmosphere, sounds/music and storylines have all been crafted with great attention to details and take the player on several journeys that make this sequel well worth playing. The game definitively feels fresh and ambitious rather than 'more of the same', and its controlled chaos makes the first Hotline Miami still relevant with its less polished but more chaotic and free ultra-violence.","March 10, 2015","true","41.4"," 404 of 462 people (87%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","87","404","462","15","6"

It is in some ways better than the first and in some ways worse. It is really up to the player to determine if it is as up to par or even better than the first. I'll sum it up quickly in a PROS and CONS list.\n\nPROS\n\n- Amazing soundtrack as usual. Not as iconic as the first but definitely more versatile.\n- Slick retro graphics that are slightly improved and more vivid than the first. Soldier's missions also throw in a more hazy variety. And the last level...prepare yourself.\n- Cleverly written and delivered story that isn't shoved down your throat. In some ways it is open to interpretation, but it is more focused and clear than the original's narrative.\n- Interesting and engaging characters...whether you hate them or not (screw Manny Pardo though. You'll know why once you play the game).\n- Core gameplay itself is as slick as ever. Nothing new as the system was good to begin with.\n- Upcoming level editor for near endless replayability and experimentation.\n- GOTTA GET A GRIP!\n\nCONS\n- Some levels have very annoying level design with an abundance of windows. Level design is NOT the same as Hotline Miami. It is one of the key break-offs and differences actually. Maps are significantly bigger and that is bittersweet. You will die a lot more times by a goon with a gun off-screen that you couldn't see. This may also be because of slightly smarter AI and I believe field of vision.\n- Lackluster hard mode. The hard mode is filled with artificial difficulty to the point where it could be viewed as unfair. With the already larger maps, adding in even more windows is frustrating.\n- Smooth gameplay experienced from the first can be notably delayed and interrupted because of the level design/hard mode (or both) in some levels.\n\nNEUTRAL\n- No more iconic mask catalog like you oh so loved in the first game. Instead, you have different characters with different abilities and playstyles depending on the chapter you are playing. The Fans are a group that have masks that each have their own unique ability, such as dual submachine guns, combat roll, or Tony's lethal punches. There's also the budget Batman known as The Writer, and The Soldier, who permanently wields a gun that can have refillable ammo on drops and a combat knife. These characters change how you play the game completely, instead of just perks like the masks in the first game. However, it really depends on what you like. The game is different because of this.\n\n\nOverall, I personally loved this game. It is one of my favorites, period. I can't decide if I like it more than the first, but I'm definitely pouring more hours into it. I don't believe it SHOULD be compared to the first, but obviously that's inevitable seeing how legendary the first installment is. If you are a fan of the series, I definitely recommend this game. If you liked the first purely for the gameplay, you may be disappointed here as it is different in many ways.\n\n9/10","March 31, 2015","true","67.7"," 101 of 116 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","101","116","5","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SoulDestroy/recommended/274170/","SoulDestroy","SoulDestroy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SoulDestroy/","385 products in account","I'd like to preface this review with a warning to anyone who hasn't played the first Hotline Miami: play that one first. Hotline Miami 2's story and difficulty assumes you've done so. There are other, more critical reasons as well, but I'll touch on that later. This review will be written with those who have played it in mind, but there will be no spoilers for either game.\n\nIntroHoly heck, it's finally here! After two long years and much angst, Hotline Miami 2 is finally on Steam, with new characters, levels, and more groovy tunes than you can shake a bloodied bat at. There's also a semblance of story this time, which is both exciting and slightly worrying: after all, wasn't part of the fun of the first game putting the soggy cardboard puzzle peices together? After about 10 hours marathoning through it all, I'm ready to give the verdict on whether or not Hotline Miami 2 is a worthy successor to the original cult classic.\n\nStory"Author, you Naughty Dog, why are you focusing on story first, rather than gameplay?" The answer is pretty simple: the inclusion of an actual story this time means that the gameplay scenarios are more tailored and guided than before. That being said, that doesn't mean the story is any good. The variety of characters and subplots is impressive in its own right, but only two of the many characters get an actual conclusion, while the other's stories just seem to... evaporate. The game ended so suddenly my jaw dropped - not because of any plot twists, but because the ending was so frying-pan-to-the-face abrupt. I'll give credit to Dennaton for creating some very interesting characters to follow, but again, little is done with most of them.\n\nEven with the actual story being mediocre, the thematic elements are interesting when dissected. Much like the first game, HM2's story benefits from discussion, as there are plenty of details that can be missed and multiple interpretations to follow. Without giving away much, the plot feels very much like a yin to the first game's yang, and can even be sobering at times. While it certainly isn't portrayed the most spectacularly, it's clear that plenty of effort was put into the story's themes, and that can certainly be appreciated.\n\nGameplaySuprise suprise, the nitty gritty of the gameplay isn't that different from its predicessor. What is different is how abilities are handled: instead of playing as one character with a vast swarth of masks to choose from, HM2 switches from character to character depending on the level, due in part to the aformentioned narrative.  The variety and swapping between narratives is fun from a purely gameplay standpoint, as each character has their own interesting twists on how they play, and the screentime between characters never feels too condensed or drawn out.\n\nUnlocks are also changed. Instead of simply unlocking masks, beating levels unlocks specific items for the character, or in the case of the Fans, characters. There are no replay-oriented objectives to do to acquire these items; by the time the game ends, all the items will be unlocked.\n\nLevel Design\nYes, this is getting its own subsection, simply because of how utterly broken the levels become. Besides the fact that there is very little of a difficulty curve (it's more akin to a very steep line), many of the levels are simply too big, rely on scummy techniques to complete, and force very specific, counterintuitive playstyles. Because some levels are so open, moving cautiously and usage of the SHIFT zoom are outright required, lest an enemy shoots at you offscreen. Most of the levels REQUIRE you to use a gun because of how spread out and well-armed the enemies are. Very often there is little choice but to  use the "peekaboo" tactic, baiting enemies out of their locations to have them run into your preferred melee weapon. Often times, completing levels feels more like a chore than an accomplishment. It's so bad, I can't bring myself to start the game again - this is coming from a guy who HAD to find out the full story in the first game.\n\nThese wouldn't be so terrible if the first Hotline Miami didn't do level design and player agency within it's level so well. As it stands, these are baffling designs that Dennaton should have perfected by now.\n\nMusicA great compilation of familiar and new artists. Even if some of the levels haphazardly enforce a slower pace, the music selection works well, for the most part. It's not purely bombastic music during gameplay this time around (not that there's anything wrong with bombastic music); depending on the character, his motifs, and the overall setting of the scene, the soundtrack can be very versatile - its not pure adrenaline all the time, like Jacket from the first game. My only complaint is that due to the new variety of songs, the soundtrack seems less focused than before; I guess going from 22 tracks from the first game to a whopping 49 tracks will inevitably cause some trail-off.\n\nConclusionI think it's important to treat Hotline Miami 2 as less of a sequel and more of a stand-alone expansion. After all, most if not all of the ideas for this game stemmed from DLC ideas from the first. There's a certain charm in playing with ideas that developers once had on their "MAYBIE?" section of their office whiteboard. The story is structured as a companion to the first game rather than a continuation. Overall, Hotline Miami 2 is a glass of wine that goes well with a bourbon steak; a wonderful compliment to the flavor of the main course, but not really something to be enjoyed purely on it's own.","March 11, 2015","true","15.2"," 130 of 163 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","130","163","6","6"

In Hotline Miami 2 you play as a number of different characters who basicaly kill people for fun, they aren't the nicest people in case you hadn't guessed. There's a couple of familiar faces from the first game, such as Tony but most of the characters are new.\n\nSadly, for me at least, Hotline Miami 2 just does not deliver on what it could have been. It's a decent game but does not come close to how good the first game was.\n\nAs you know I had already posted a negative review of this but after playing it a little more I have decided to rewrite my review and change the recommendation.\n\n+Same great pixel graphics\n+Another outstanding soundtrack\n+A number of very different characters each with their own style\n+Most of the characters you play as are so called fans of the original crew which I thought added an interesting level of depth to the game world\n+The same brutal gameplay we all know and love from the original\n+More gore than you could ever dream of\n+Can be played with KB&M or a controller\n+A couple of new weapons which are fun to play with\n+One of the characters can dual wield which is a hell of a lot of fun\n+One of the characters is in fact two characters you play as simultaneously!\n\n+/-More of a focus on firearms rather than melee weapons. Personally I don't like this since I much preferred melee in the first game but it really depends on what you like more\n+/-Levels are far more open and are a lot bigger than in the first game. Personally I thought this slowed down the pace of the game and made it more difficult to know where enemies are but again it comes down to what you prefer\n+/-You can now take a hit from some of the weapons without dying\n\n-Far too many windows which leads to lots of cheap deaths\n-The game's AI is pretty bad. The AI's reaction to what's going on is a considerable downgrade from the first game, I found myself being able to shoot in an adjacent room (with an open door or window) or sometimes even in the same room as enemy AI without them noticing me which is beyond ridiculous, it also means that you can no longer use gunfire to lure enemies closer to you for a melee kill\nariety when it comes to melee weapons, most of them have been removed and there are no unlocks\n-No more human shields\n-Enemies frequently get stuck on doors\n-The level editor still isn't implemented in the game\n\nVerdict:\n6\n\nHotline Miami 2 is a decent game that captures the brutality of the first game well and gives us another great soundtrack, sadly it just isn't as good as the first game. I'd recommend getting it on sale unless you really cannot wait.\n\nEl K.","March 14, 2015","true","3.7"," 207 of 276 people (75%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","75","207","276","12","18"

Hotline Miami (which from now on I will call hlm because thats easier to type out) is a crazy top down shooter with a super dope soundtrack. It's filled with violence and moments that leave you just in awe. HLM2 has lots positives and negatives and I feel that the easiest way for me to do this review is if I split this into a list of Pos/Negs and then give my final word on the game.\n\nPositiveSoundtrack\nThe music in this game actually manages to improve on the first game's. The songs get you super pumped up and ready to blow heads off or get you feeling mellow and make you reflect upon the bloodbath you just caused. I really reccomend you buy the soundtrack here.\nWeapon variety\nThere are a load of new guns and melees for you to try to murder someone with. The guns are a welcome change, the gun play is sorta refreshing now, because it feels like there is an actual variety in what gun to use.\nStory\nSome people may not like the story, but personally I really enjoyed the way that they did the story. There was backstory to HLM1 and it showed the world after the events of HLM1 too. I won't spoil anything but the ending is definitely going to annoy a lot of people but personally I thought it was a great way to end off the game.\nNegativeLevel Design\nYou probably expected me to complain about this because frankly everyone has. The levels are way too big and open which would be only half as bad if the levels also werent littered with windows and it is very very annoying to get sniped from some butthead across the level.\n"Hide and Seek"\nThe game has basically become playing hide and seek in order to clear levels due to the size and windows leaving you out in the open and vulnerable to be shot by someone you cannot see.\nSoldier levels\nThe soldier levels are honestly one of the most unfun levels in the game due to being limited to one gun and knife the whole time and having to refill your ammo only to get half the normal amount of ammo. It leads to you camping the nearest ammo bin and just luring people to you.\nHotline Miami 2 is a game for the diehard fans of the first game who want a conclusion to the story and are willing to deal with the new style of play in this game in order to recieve the conclusion they dearly wanted. If you're not a fan of 1 or don't really want to play the story I'd reccomend you stay away unless you're excited for the level editor that's soon coming and want to play community creations.","March 21, 2015","true","14.3"," 86 of 102 people (84%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","84","86","102","12","7"

Sadly, I just cannot recommend this one. It just doesn't have what made Hotline Miami fun to me.\n\nWhat I loved about Hotline Miami was that each level was a bit like a puzzle. You worked your way through it, with each death teaching you something new until you found the optimal route through the level. The levels were often small and claustrophobic, with narrow corridors and many rooms. Melee was a very viable strategy as you could lure enemies through chokepoints. Hotline Miami 2 throws this all out in favor of big open levels that rely more on guns and often render melee unfeasible. I find myself moving slowly through levels, hiding behind walls while waiting for enemies to come into range of my gun so I can safely dispatch them. I am often killed by off-screen enemies who I cannot even see when using Shift to extend my view range. Many deaths are a case of bad luck instead of a mistake on behalf of the player. Whereas my experience with Hotline Miami was fast and frantic, my experience with Hotline Miami 2 is slow and ponderous.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin for me is the technical issues. If I enable V-sync, I get mouse lag which often gets me killed as I cannot turn fast enough to kill enemies. If I disable V-sync, I get terrible screen tearing that makes the game unbearable to look at. If I try to play in Borderless Fullscreen mode, I have to put up with the mouse lag again.\n\nSad to say, as much as I loved the original Hotline Miami, I'm getting a refund on this one.","May 6","false","2.6"," 132 of 189 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","132","189","4","6"

The idea of a larger level sounds nice, but pausing to scope around ruins the intensity for me. It's like if in Sonic the Hedgehog you just had to look up and down all the time instead of running at a quick pace.\n\nAlso, the addition of different characters for what I guess story purposes and their little "quirks" come at no warning.  This again, ruins the flow of the game.  You're at a good pace through the level only to suddenly find out when your character executes a mafia member by beating their head in...again..and again..and again, until you click RMB to move.  Which you don't assume is the case, as before characters beat the enemies head once or twice and got off automatically.  Thus, you get killed by a gunman because you didn't know he wouldn't hop off automatically.\n\nAlso, the story segments in between levels are interesting...But I'd much prefer them to just be a cutscene, rather than hobbling along trying to find the random exit or object I need to grab just to get to the next level.  A minor thing, but something I feel ruins the fast paceness of the game.  I had this complaint about the original.\n\nThe difficulty levels through the game jump a lot too.  One level might be super easy then the next much harder, only for the next one to be easy.  I assume this was for story reasons.\n\nLastly, the AI seems to get confused alot during play.  Multiple times I've seen enemies get stuck on a door and spin around in circles like a maniac.  Also, the AI loves to get stuck on corners, mostly doors though.  The AI also doesn't seem to "click" when it hears gunshots.  Several times I was like "He should have heard that".\n\nIt's not "awful" by any means.  I just enjoyed how the original paced itself compared to this one. When I get into a good groove in a game I don't like it broken and Hotline Miami 2 has a little too many design changes that does that for me.  I feel like some of the changes were made for "story" reasons..even though the story is so obscure half the time, and not for good game design reasons.\n\nThe OST is decent though.","March 10, 2015","false","2.8"," 302 of 465 people (65%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","65","302","465","15","18"

But let me start with the not so well executed parts of this game:\n\nSpace around alot of obstacles imply you could walk around them, but blocking your way with collision instead. Limited character selection in combination with the sometimes linear level design makes it frustrating to complete a stage, giving you less options to approach a level. While some characters and their abilities make it easy to go through a stage, some other loadouts can completely frustrate the player. Gladly there is a 'rewind' option.\n\nOn the other hand, the way they wrapped up the story expecially with the well selected soundtrack (once again) and the new character selection is top-notch. Makes you want to complete it twice because you didn't get the ending!\n\nSome reviewers mind the look-further function which snaps weirdly. I agree, but must say: Use it wisely. No need to downgrade due to a minor detail that you can surely work-around to enjoy the game.\n\nThey added a new snap function, which allows you to snap to enemies even if they are not inside your field of view. In addition I also enjoy the ability to sort of explore the character by finding out what his or her secondary ability is and how to play the character in the best possible way.\n\nI'd also like to mention that small 'puzzle' elements, e.g. 'how do I get to this gun to kill these bodyguards?' are HIGHLY satisfying. Or picking up the only gun behind a door to mow down 7 mobsters who rush toward you shortly after. Another example is using a sniper rifle in an open level, which is amazingly satisfying as well and breaks the usual very hard gameplay up a little.\n\nTo sum up: Killing people is a simple job, but who said it will be easy?

HM2 is bloodier, and it's much harder. However, I think it's harder due to poor level design. The best way to put it is most of the levels are like the really hard floor in the chapter "Hot & Heavy" (you know the one). Most levels have long corridors and lots of windows, so most of the time you won't know there's an enemy till it's too late.\n\nHM2 has a much more complex storyline, as it involves around a dozen playable characters, and I'm considering playing through it multiple times just to understand it.\n\nMy main gripe is that there is much less unlockable content in this game. HM had tons of weapons and masks that you could use on EVERY LEVEL. HM2 has around 10 unlockable masks and 3 unlockable weapons that you can use on certain levels. You could argue that the new masks are cool, quality over quantity and all that, but I think there should've been more masks.\n\nHowever, whether you should buy Hotline Miami 2 all depends on ONE THING. How in-depth is the level editor? That level editor can easily make or break the game for me. Can you imagine playing a recreation of Doom, with a custom Doom Guy mask?\n\nIn conclusion, if you REALLY need more Hotline Miami, you should get this game. It's no where near as good as the first one, but it's still pretty good I guess. If you really don't want to risk your money on this, wait for the level editor to come out, and then see what people think of the level editor. It should be out sometime this spring.","March 12, 2015","true","13.7"," 59 of 78 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","59","78","0","0"

Your mileage may vary.\nIf there was shrug instead of a thumbs up/down I'd be using that.\n\nThe Good-Music\nStill good, but doesn't loop in some situations, and in other cases is barely even there. Likely technical issues that may be patched in the future.\n\n-Some gameplay decisions\nI actually really liked how the developers used gameplay to characterize Evan, the writer. He isn't a psychopath or a killer like most of the player characters, as such will not kill enemies unless the player forces him to. Instead he will knock them out with blunt objects, unload firearms, and refuse to pick up knives. However, if the player executes two downed enemies he will fly into a rage and kill enemies violently. You get more points for neutralizing enemies non-lethally, likely because it is better for his mental health.\nThe player is still given the option to play how they want, but through gameplay it is readily apparent what Evan would prefer to do, and that is pretty neat.\n\n-The VHS effects\nare actually pretty convincing and well done. And I know how hard those are to do.\n\nThe Bad-Story\nI personally felt that the story was worse, and will try to say why without spoiling too much.\nI felt that it takes itself too seriously, tries to explain too much of things that are irrelevant while glossing over things that would make the story a cohesive whole. The experiences of some characters are completely pointless from a story telling perspective, perhaps a casualty of having so many different playable characters. It also becomes apparent that it takes place in an alternate history, which I feel is a step down from first game being vague about the setting.\nAlso violates the rule of "show don't tell" far too often.\n\n-Level design\nThe first game encouraged recklessness, allowing the player to rely on reactions and instinct to get through levels. This was possible thanks to the tight and focused design of many of the stages, separated into small chunks. A player could reliably use walls and doors to their advantage, as very few areas were wide and open.\n\nHotline Miami 2 plays more like a top-down cover shooter. Single "floors" in this game can be the size of entire chapters from the first game, which severely punishes the reckless, instinctual gameplay style the first game was known for. Wide open areas, windows everywhere, extremely long hallways, and way too many dudes with guns are the culprits here. As a result, players will move towards an extremely cautous playstyle, advancing slowly and checking every angle constantly, lest they lose five or even ten minutes of progress. This is much less interesting, more frustrating, and more importantly, much less fun.\n\n-Glitches and AI\nEnemies in the game act unpredictably, some will run to the source of gunfire when they hear it, others will stay still. Enemies will often melee you through walls, or shoot you from offscreen, and get caught on geometry (most often doorways) vibrating rapidly and becoming invulnerable. The one AI partner in the game also has hideous pathfinding and gets stuck on doors often as well.\nHopefully these issues will be patched in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, as someone who enjoyed the first game I find myself enjoying this game less. But as I said at the beginning, your mileage may vary.","March 16, 2015","false","7.0"," 299 of 472 people (63%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","63","299","472","10","17"

In fact, it didn't please some of HM fans. However, I still recommend this game. Basically, it's sharing the same mechanics as Hotline Miami 1. It is still about ♥♥♥♥ing enemies up with that feeling of doing it flawlessly.\n\nThe levels changed a lot from Hotline Miami 1 when it comes to the size. Levels in general are just HUGE, which leads to this problem, the first time you'll play, you will die a lot by enemies off screen that you can't see even by Shift looking. The game is even harder than the first. I've seen lots of people complaining about the amount of windows, but that didn't bother me that much, overall I like the levels in this form,  they are designed well for the most part, and all of them have a route to run them and doing a great Rank.  Sadly, some of the object in game are not that well designed. Like the thing in Dead Ahead that looks like a turbine, engine, or whatever, you don't really know if it will block you or not. However, it's not happening too much on the levels.\n\nHotline Miami 2 tried to rebalance the weapons and the masks in general. Remember Tony and its completely OP mask in the first game? Forget it there, it was nerfed very baddly. You can just use your fist to kill, and the devs make you fight enemies in a level where you are forced to bait them because they have guns. A Biker set for Tony would have been nice, using throwing knives and then using your fist. The game is more oriented on using fire weapons, it nerfed the OP knife, and with how the levels are designed, you will use guns most of the time. Finally for the weapons, now all of the fire weapons are one shot, one kill, except for the fatties, which is a good thing.\n\nSome new enemies are there, and they are fine, except the Grabbers that are just glitchy as hell grabbing you through walls! Talking about glitches, there are a few bugs that are annoying, like stucking yourself, being hit in a corner and you shouldn't be. When it comes to the masks you have WAY less choices, but let's face it, in the first HM, some of the masks were useless,\n\nStory wise, the game answers a lot of things from the first game, but it's really a mess because of all those flashbacks etc. It was still entertaining to follow the story, especially with all those different characters.\n\nOverall, I think you should get that game at some point, either at full price, or with a discount. It's an amazing game.\n\nAnd ♥♥♥♥ you Tony.","May 20, 2015","true","921.9"," 37 of 44 people (84%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","84","37","44","9","0"

I've been wanting to since around the fourth chapter, but I stuck around to the end to make sure what I had to say still remained valid, or if I was going to be proven wrong somehow.\n\nI wasn't.\n\nFirst off, I am an enormous fan of the first game. I've put 40-50 hours in on PC, and have beaten it on PC, PS3 and Vita [with the hidden ending on all three]. I love playing random games of it here and there. I'm decent at it - not great, but can usually get Bs and above on most maps.\n\nI was thrilled when I saw that Hotline Miami 2 was coming out, and while I didn't get a chance to play it launch day, I was eager to the next day. The first few chapters were fun... but then it became glaringly obvious that not only was the narrative style different in this game [which I didn't mind at all and still think is interesting now that I'm done], but the mechanics were as well. Gone is the system of accumulating masks as you go, opening up playstyle [and replay style, playing late-game masks on early maps] - instead, the game features a large cast of playable characters, each with their own unlocks [or not]. While some of these are interesting, I feel that the restrictions this puts on gameplay hamper more than enhance. While this system of multiple characters is necessary for how the plot is delivered, it forces the player into certain playstyles / decisions depending on the map / character.\n\nThe other major mechanical change comes in the layout of the maps, and that most of them are - as other reviews have stated - entirely too filled with windows, or enormous open rooms / hallways. The original did have some instances of this, but for the most part HM1's maps were tight, lower-visibility rooms / halls which meant you were more free to be stealthy and enemies were restricted in their vision. This is not the case here - all too often during your first play through, you're going to find yourself sniped by an enemy nearly the entire screen away, which was able to see you due to the layout of the map or line of sight through a window. Eventually I just got used to this, but it was extremely frustrating. HM1 had a few maps where you'd get shot through a window you didn't know was there [until this happened], but it seemed very, very frequent in HM2.\n\nAlong with the above, I felt like a few times some maps were geared towards a specific plan as being the only way to beat the map. Maps which start you with a certain character, and in a certain place, where it seemed that unless you do X, then Y, then Z, you'll get killed every time. This is unfortunate, given the first game's freedom to clear maps in different ways, depending on mask choice and random weapon drops. Hard to discuss this without spoiling maps, but again it felt like there were a few situations that felt like I had very limited options.\n\nMost of the time, though, my strategy for beating any given map was this:\n\n1. Find a room with as few windows as possible, run to it praying I don't get killed\n2. Pop around door to bring enemies running, or shoot a gun to bring them running\n3. Kill them as they came through doorway [maybe]\n4. Repeat until this doesn't work, then go clean up the rest\n\nMany, many times for me, a given map would have enormous piles of dead bodies clustered near doors, because it was the least-frustrating way to beat the map.\n\nAnd then there are the glitches - and this game has a lot of glitches. The worst for me tended to be the doors - enemies passing through doors, about 50% of the time, became invincible. This made it very difficult to spring out from beside a door and hit a dog / human coming through the door, because most of the time they'd be invincible. I'd miss, then they'd end up killing me. The glitch regarding enemies spinning in place, or spinning in doorways has been mentioned frequently. I noticed another glitch, which for all I know might be intentional and not a glitch at all, but in one of the early chapters my aiming crosshair seemed to move erratically - it didn't circle around my player like normal, it seemed to circle random parts of the screen around my character, and he stayed focused on it wherever I moved him. Eventually this stopped though, and I never saw it after, which again makes me wonder if it was some intentional, but annoying, quirk.\n\nThis game is also ludicrously, unneccessarily hard. Hotline Miami 1 was pretty hard, but it's what I'd consider "Demon's Souls" hard - when I'd die, I could tell it was because of something stupid that I did, and I'd learn from it and improve [even if it took a few dozen deaths]. HM1 was "fun hard". In Hotline Miami 2, the game throws poorly designed, overly-visible maps at you and armies of heavily armed enemies, and significantly restricts your methods of dealing with both, and that's why it's difficult - and throws the glitches in to make it even worse. It isn't "Well darn, I ran out into the open without looking, that's on me!", it's "I just got picked off by an enemy that I couldn't even see with my view extended as far as I could in his direction", "I just swung my axe at that dog coming through that door, but apparently he was invincible, and just mauled me to death", and "I'm stuck with a character that is entirely unsuited for dealing with this map, I wish I had someone else".\n\nI cannot for the life of me understand major sites saying this improves on Hotline Miami 1 in "nearly every way". It's a very different game mechanically, and I suppose some reviewers saw that as an improvement, whereas I see it as fixing something that wasn't broken.\n\nI'm sitting here, and I'm staring at the buttons that indicate whether I can recommend this game or not, and I'm agonizing over it. When this game is good, it's actually pretty fun. I feel like there were a few maps that did bring back that fast paced but strategic feel of Hotline Miami 1. As others have said, the soundtrack is phenominal [it's not HM1's soundtrack, but it's very good]. The last fight was way, way better than HM1's was [and the level leading up to it is awesome]. However, when the game is bad, it is horrible. I nearly uninstalled it a few times, but I just had to know if the bad was temporary, or if it was just a running theme, and unfortunately it was a running theme. Far enough in, and I was just finishing the game because I'd already made it as far as I had - I mean sure I wanted to see where the story went also, but at some point it just became "well it'll be over at some point, I might as well". I somehow made it through without snapping my 360 controller in half, and I am proud of myself for that.\n\nI don't even know what to recommend to fix this game, I feel like most of my problems can't be fixed without completely redoing most of the maps. I suppose as far as the character thing goes, it's kind of a necessity given how the plot is delivered.\n\nUltimately, I just can't recommend this. People who have never played Hotline Miami 1 are going to be frustrated at the insane difficulty and not be used to how it plays in general from playing HM1; people who have played HM1, like me, are going to be in for a very different experience than HM1, and an incredibly frustrating one at times, but not a terribly rewarding one after all is said and done. There's good in this game, but it's buried under the frustrating, buggy rest of the game. Get it if you adore HM1, though - your mileage may vary, taste is subjective, etc.","March 16, 2015","false","21.9"," 156 of 241 people (65%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","65","156","241","7","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fishthegamer/recommended/274170/","Fishthegamer","Most Extreme Primate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fishthegamer/","28 products in account","Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number, seems like the perfect way a sequel should be executed. In theory. The game features significantly MORE of everything, there's larger maps, a considerably longer campaign, more playable characters, more missions, overall going with the assumption that Bigger=Better. This is generally true, as it is not a sequels job to evolve gameplay in significant ways, thats the job of new IP's. What a sequel is generally supposed to do, is take an already stellar concept, and add on to it, refine it, fine tune every small detail until it reaches the potential it always had. Wrong number does this in many ways, and for the most part does it beautifully. However, as I was about 2 hours in to wrong number, I noticed something that greatly concerned me. I had stopped playing it. The original Hotline is in my opinion perfect. Every single aspect of the game was executed flawlessly, the tone, the atmosphere, the soundtrack, the vague and ambiguous story, the incredible adrenaline rush as you murdered dozens of faceless mobsters for the thousandth time that level, and how you snap back into reality when the music stops, and you realize the horrific atrocities you've just committed. And then you do it again. Anyway, there was not a single time for my entire first playthrough of the original Hotline Miami where I stopped playing. Even though the game was, when you think about it, very repetitive, I was never bored. It concerned me when the sequel didn't have the same effect. Granted, it's considerably longer, but I don't think that's the only reason. I decided to delve deeper and try to find out what exactly went wrong in Hotline Miami 2. Let's start with the pros.\n\nThe story in Wrong Number was absolutely fantastic. It opted to drop the Vagueness of it's predecessor, to  great effect. Wrong Number tackles significantly bigger topics then HL before it, and ends up succeeding with flying colors. For the first few scenes, I was somewhat concerned that the story would be more convoluted than Season 6 of Lost, but as it progressed, I understood the tale the writers had in mind, and really enjoyed it. You play as a multitude of "Protagonists" this time around, all of which have unique personalities and motives for their actions. There's a film star, a Corrupt Cop (Clear inspiration from Showtime's "Dexter") An actual serial killer, A soldier in Vietnam, a drug Kingpin, a Failed writer, a group of Vigilantes hoping to recreate Jackets rampages throughout the first game, and numerous others. Each story was well written, intricate, and differed greatly from the others. Without venturing into spoiler territory, You're in for a treat. Another positive note, is that the fast, fluid, adrenaline fueled gameplay returns in full force. There aren't any significant chances to the formula, besides a few new enemy types, however I'm pleased that they kept the flawless gameplay virtually untouched. Obviously the soundtrack is phenomenal. Like, its freaking awesome. The game is also SIGNIFICANTLY more difficult than the original, including an unlockable hard mode, for those who require practice in punching computer screens. The difficulty change is both a blessing and a curse, which I'll get to in a minute. Now for the negatives.\n\nWrong number is a hard game. If you haven't played the original, PLAY IT FIRST OR ELSE YOURE BONED. I was still able to eventually beat it, but some of the levels  I was forced to exploit AI problems to win. However, Wrong Number, unlike it's predecessor, often feels unfair. Anytime I died in HL1, it was due to my own poor timing or slow trigger finger. with enough patience and skill, you could tackle any situation the game threw at you, everytime. Less so with it's sequel. As I mentioned earlier, the levels are much larger. And considerably denser. And whoever designed these apartments, clubs, and military bases has a very strange obsession with windows. THEY. ARE. EVERYWHERE. I can not even count the number of times I cleared a massive area, which often took minutes (Which because of the multitude of restarts, minutes+Wrong Number=Hours) and as I rounded the corner, some unbelievable accurate enemy spotted me from across the dimension, shot at me with pinpoint accuracy FROM OFFSCREEN, and I was forced to play this one FREAKING area again for the billionth time! THIS GAME MIGHT BREAK YOU! So yeah, unfair difficulty. Next point. Something I always loved about the original Hotline, was the freedom given to you at each level. There was a massive selection of masks, each giving significant buffs to Jacket, which helped you find a playstyle that worked for you. There were also a multitude of paths that can be taken through the level, based of your both your play style and preference. This is reduced heavily in the sequel, and I think I found out why. Its essentially because in HL1, gameplay drives story. You do whatever you want in a level, and the game doesn't care. It gives you a number of options, you pick one, and you go on a majestically brutal murderous rampage. you're given a blank canvas to draw a picture of some drug lord choking on his own large intestine. However in HL2, story drives gameplay. You play almost every level exactly as the developer intended, with only a few levels straying from the beaten path, and even then only slightly. Because there are specific characters for specific levels, you dont get to choose a mask at the beginning of each level. The only times you get to choose a mask (I believe)  Are for the fans/kingpin, where you get either a BARREL ROLL, killing blows (But unarmed), dual characters armed with a chainsaw and an interchangable firearm (this one was pretty amazing) or dualweilding machine guns. And then theres the one snake guy who either get's a nailgun, killing throws, or I think (I dont remeber this one) like some martial arts thing. Even though the mask system is present, its also considerably more limited, and often times restrictive. Why can't tony carry weapons? Why cant the bear drop his weapons at will, or at least reload when he wants to? These questionable game design choices are pointless and frusturating, and very dissapointing. In addition, the different ways each character plays, and the lack of choice makes for a more linear and, in my opinion, watered down experience.\n\nI've said a lot in this review, but I haven't answered the one, simple question. Do I recommend this game? Absolutely. I said many negative things about this game, and I stand by those. However, the game is still a Hotline Miami game. The gameplay mechanics are amazing, the story is fantastic, the music is incredible, the atmosphere is spot on, it is an amazing game! However, is it as good as Hotline Miami 1? Not remotely. But how could it be? Hotline Miami was perfect, and truly did not need a sequel. But, if there has to be a sequel to it, it really couldn't be better than this. If you don't have the original, get that now. If you hate the original, there is no chance that this game will win you over. If you loved the original? You have to get this game. It's more of the same. The same is fantastic. Hotline Miami 2 is disappointing. It's a sequel to one of the greatest games ever made, it's bound to be. But am I glad I played it? Without a doubt in my twisted little mind.","March 23, 2015","true","77.7"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","30","33","3","1"

Rinse and repeat on the next corner you find. The maps are too open, and have WAY too many enemies in them. The first game was about overcoming challenges, the second one is about overcoming twenty challenges in a row, and failing one of them puts you back at the start. Generally not very fun.\n\nThey did fix the mouse controls pretty quickly, so that's no longer a negative point. They're perfect as it is now.\n\nThe level design is simply where this game falls flat. Someone put it in a rather eloquent way: "some levels made me feel like I was playing a top-down version of Counter-Strike, instead of Hotline Miami."\n\nPlease, just buy the first game instead.

(by saying good soundtrack, I mean there were few good tracks tossed in there)\n+Alex and Ash! Oh.. okay - this one needs some more details. Alex and Ash is a mask choice that lets you play as 2 serial killers at once. One of them - Ash - has a chainsaw and another has a ranged weapon - any ranged weapon you can find on the ground or the standart pistol that Alex gets at the start of the level. Very fun character despite buggy A.I.. Sad thing is that you can't choose any mask for any level you want now - there are different timelines and different roles you must take, so no - you can't go Fists of Fury every single level. And oh yeah - some masks are very unique, but the total number of masks reduced when compared with the first game.\n\nNow let's get to the truth which is difficult to accept - Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number is very hard to recommend. Don't get me wrong - this game is not absolutely bad, but it's a sequel to the Hotline: Miami, and as such it's not very fun. Actually it's far from the original Hotline Miami. Developers tried to make this game more realistic and that created a lot of problems. Let's talk about them. Before I start ranting on the combat system, let me tell that this game isn't as fast as the first one. And pacing really kills that mad blood lust of running without any fear of death from the HM1, because sometimes you have to play boring characters in long cover based shootouts (levels with a detective character are especially guilty of this). Other thing I didn't like was the story. It's forgettable and quite frankly, very generic when compared to HM1's "Acid-Hallucination-Trip with a talking rooster who knows more about what's going on here than you do".\nOkay, let's get down to the combat and level design:\n-Melee system is now almost useless, because weapon throws aren't as powerful (half of your thrown weapons will drop 10 centimeters away from you and will not reach their target), so you can't stun or kill enemies without firearms as reliably as you could in the original HM. What makes melee even worse is level design. levels are now huge. You can only see very small part of the floor without endangering yourself. You easilly die by the shots that were fired from across the map, where you couldn't even see. Needless to say, levels are now unnecessarily difficult. In the first game every time you died, you died because you made a mistake, made a risky play or just had a bad luck with A.I. (A.I. likes to react to those gunshots that they want to react to). Now you will die much much more and not because of your mistakes - no. You will die as much as it takes for you to remember every single enemy on the map that is 2-3 times bigger than in the previous game. Small rooms and corridors were changed to big open halls and open large rooms full of regular enemies and the larger ones that take ~4 seconds to kill. I know, they were in the first game too, but this time some of them carry automatic rifles and are followed by several soldiers. Also, that room is surrounded by 3 other rooms full of enemies. If you try to kill them all carefully - you will fail. There is little careful planning in this game. That aspect of the game, just like fun melee system, was swapped with running with your gun (or knife if you run out of ammo) from room to room trying to clear them out before you die, so you could catch your breath and thin out enemy numbers as much as possible by luring them to the doorways. Sounds fun? It isn't. It just is not fun, because as soon as you feel that you cleared all the enemies except 1 or 2 that are standing in the room across the corridor you will run there only to get shot in the head by the guy, who was standing under some object that made him almost invisible. You may say that it used to happen in the first Hotline Miami and dying is the part of the game. And you would be correct. You could die by someone you couldn't clearly see and dying was a part of experience - but you have to remember that due to bigger levels, autosaves are now very rare, making you curse this game for killing your character in the cheapest way possible.\n\nWhen I played the first Hotline Miami, I never raged. For me it was adrenaline fueled run, where every kill was satisfying - especially when going into the room with Fists of fury. In Hotline Miami 2 and its open, large levels it's rarely possible, so prepare to cower behind the corner, fearing for your life when you know the level is about to end, but you must go through the last corridor. And you know that if you slip up just a little bit - click one button a moment too late - you will die and you will have to go through the entire same floor that is big enough to fit 4 floors from HM1. Believe me - at that point no amount of good retro themed soundtracks will help you. Prepare for the endless grinding and a new type of story telling that doesn't really fit the mood of the first game. If you never played Hotline Miami - go buy the first one. If you are not sure if you want buy this game after playing the original - don't bother.\n\n*No, I didn't like this game (but that doesn't mean that you can't like it - if you do, please - enjoy it). Finishing this game for me it was a chore and I would rather eat a bag of caterpillars than play through this drawn out nonsense AGAIN. And not because it's that bad - it's just too long and makes you play as characters you don't even like. On the other hand, caterpillars aren't so bad also - they are rich in proteins.","December 8, 2015","false","8.6"," 173 of 275 people (63%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","63","173","275","10","18"

Unfortunately, while I blew through the first one and loved every minute, this sequel was disappointing and hard to fight through.\n\nFirstly, the controls were sticky: I'd latch on to walls and get slaughtered, unable to move around the corner or turn enough to attack. Often the bullets would even pass through the enemy or the doors wouldn't register connecting with the enemy. In both cases, I was quickly killed and made to start over.\n\nSecond, the story was too jumbled. It was an absolute mess. I understand the idea of running multiple storylines and that storylines needn't always line up perfectly, but this wasn't a good way to do it. The stories would switch almost chapter after chapter and, while they might sync up, most times they clashed harshly. Further, the stories weren't that interesting. There was two that I enjoyed, but the others just seemed boring or pointless. In trying to use so many perspectives, the developers ended up muddying the story.\n\nFinally, the level design is far poorer than the first game's. They gave big, open rooms and gave most enemies guns. Coupled with sticking to the walls, I was often the victim of ten simultaneous shotgun blasts painting the walls with my brain. This could just be my own poor skills, but it often turned the game away from the quick-paced gorefest of its predecessor and toward a strategy game where I waited behind walls for ambushes and lured enemies into choke points. I may love strategy games, but I don't play Hotline Miami to get my fix.\n\nAs a successor to the wonderful Hotline Miami, this is a poor one. It has much of the aesthetic feel of the original, which I adored, and the themes are both an expansion and faithful redesign of the orignal game's. However, the problems I stated previously ruin the otherwise good experience. If there is another sequel, I will still purhase it and play it through. However, after this, I might wait for the sale. Preferably, a big one.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It's not more difficult because of good design. A better word to describe it would be: Frustrating.\nFor the most part, the difficulty in Hotline Miami 2 comes from a very different place than in Hotline Miami 1. In HM1, the difficulty came from well-made levels and good design, but in HM2, the difficulty generally comes from bad controls, bugs, and horrible level design.\nHM2 is a much more gun oriented duck and cover version of the original Hotline Miami. Melee is fairly useless in HM2 and you are punished for trying to use it instead of guns.\nI have to say.... I was really disappointed in Hotline Miami 2 when i first played it. It seemed to be a huge let-down.\nAfter i got over that, i tried it again and went much farther into the game.\nMy opinion has changed and i think i was too harsh on it: Hotline Miami 2 is worse than the original in many ways, but it is definitely its own game. It doesn't completely copy HM1 and it has a feel of its own. While i was disappointed in many ways and i still prefer the original, Hotline Miami 2 has many things that make it special and fun, as well.\nThe new characters are interesting and fun to use, and the music and art are still very good. I also really like the look of some of the new menu screens and such, like the pause screen and level select.\n\nOverall, Hotline Miami 2 is not quite as good as the original, in my opinion, but that's all it is:\nMy opinion.\nIt is possible that many people will like Hotline Miami 2 MORE than the original, as it is just very different.\n\nI would definitely not say Hotline Miami 2 is a bad game, but i would also not say that it completely succeeds as a sequel. That said, i think that every Hotline Miami fan should at least try the game to see if they like it because it's still a good game and brings many new things that the original did not have.\n\nMy rating for Hotline Miami 2 is:\n7.5/10","March 11, 2015","true","7.9"," 66 of 97 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","66","97","7","6"

Poor level design (♥♥♥♥ing windows), enemies shooting from off your screen, inconsistent AI reactions and patrols (normally a great feature in games but not here), randomised AI weapons and occasional glitches really ♥♥♥♥ing annoy you when they get you killed cheaply during an otherwise fine run. It's also much more likely to limit your options if you take the wrong weapon (i.e. not a gun) with you through to the next level's start and in general the game is a lot more limiting in terms of playstyles than the first.\n\nHaving larger levels hurts in general since you'll be losing more if you die and really just results in boredom. It also makes hunting down that one remaining enemy before your combo dies a common experience contributing to the 'only one right way to do a level' issue and the general slow feeling of the game. Indeed the first game's addictive and fast, brutal combat is now just a slow trial and error memorisation game where 1/10 tries will be ended by something largely outside of your control like the ai acting incorrectly. I'm all for difficult games but they need to be challenging, not frustrating.\n\nJumping between characters out of order might have made for unique storytelling but in terms of gameplay it's ♥♥♥♥ing annoying to swap from one set of abilities to another and back again repeatedly. Frankly the game also feels a little long in a bad way with lots of the earlier levels being quite samey. This isn't a huge issue, I suppose, and is probably better than it being too short but the game is still introducing new enemy types and characters with new gameplay styles (13 in total, not counting masks) in the 20th ♥♥♥♥ing level. Hard mode helps a little but isn't an option for your first time and makes the game even more frustrating by ♥♥♥♥ing with the level design and weapons.\n\nOn the subject of the story specifically it wasn't terrible by any means (other than the ending...) but it wasn't worth the effort of piecing together the timeline of the various levels. I personally preferred the original game's approach of limited exposition and showing over telling also. Here we just have a ♥♥♥♥ton of characters dumped into the game who are introduced and eventually dropped with no real purpose or overall plot. If we're going to have a story that so often gets in the way of gameplay and pacing it should at least be a ♥♥♥♥ing good one.\n\nIn theory there's more replayability here as not only can you try for top scores on each level but also play the game through again on hard mode and have a ♥♥♥♥ton of different playstyles available. In practice I doubt I'll bother playing it through more than once on each mode while I still play the original game through now and again after 100%ing it. Part of this stems from the problems with hard mode. While it's good that the developers didn't just throw more enemies in and call it a day there are cases where levels are nearly uncompleteable with the wrong weapon (and god help you if the RNG gives guards the wrong weapons too).\n\nI'd probably still recommend picking it up cheaply and playing it through at least once and it certainly isn't all bad. There are few games of this style and fewer yet worth playing at all and had this game come before the first one I'd probably be a lot more impressed. The soundtrack is good and the art style is fine though one level at least is annoyingly dark to the degree of hurting gameplay (maybe an intentional choice but difficulty for the sake of difficulty is again a poor decision). The game just needed to be more focussed to be truly classic like the first.","May 14","false","7.8"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","30","38","3","5"

All of this means you have to advance slowly and carefully, abusing the view distances and such. Gone are the days of improvised driller-killer rushes. There's less choice in picking masks before levels so don't expect as much freedom in your playstyle and weapon picks. On top of this, there are more enemies which are immune to certain weapons and they interrupt your flow as you have to backtrack to find the correct weapons to kill them. It's not a freeform killer puzzle anymore.\n\nEven though the soundtrack is good, the gameplay just isn't fun enough.

The quick, versatile gameplay accompanied by an 80s style retro soundtrack was amazing and really complimented the game.  This isn't about the first Hotline, however, this is about the second. Hotline Miami 2 fails to live up to its predecessor; however, it does have some interesting features that makes it feel a bit more fun at times.\nI’ll jump right into the pros, the soundtrack, for one, is amazing. Just like the first game, the soundtrack really drags you into the gameplay and just feels great. Whether you’re simply playing peek-a-boo with the enemies or running down a hallway guns blazing, the music blasting will certainly pump some blood in your veins.\nThe graphics, although very similar to the first game, have improved. It still has that arcade feel, but more refined. Along with that, the developers have really made the levels feel less bland overall. The detail in the game is immense and really adds to vibe of the game overall.\nThe last real good thing I can say is the different characters you can play as. Whereas Hotline 1 was restricted to just Jacket and Biker, there are so many other characters you can play in this one. Most of them have something that makes them different from the others, whether it’s rolling around or using two characters at the same time (my personal favorite.)\nUnfortunately, there are only so many good things you can say about this game. One of the core elements of a video game is the gameplay itself. Hotline Miami 2’s gameplay is extremely disappointing. Hotline Miami 2 is centered around guns like crazy and it’s gets to a point where the whole game is frustrating in itself. Whereas Hotline Miami made guns an ineffective way to the finish the level, and even frowned upon at times, Hotline Miami 2’s levels have most if not all enemies wielding guns. Pair that up with terrible shooting controls and extremely open levels and you got a recipe for disaster.\nSpeaking of levels, the level design in terms of gameplay is far from great. The levels feel so big and open that it makes it very hard to spot enemies, forcing the game into a game of peek-a-boo and sometimes even blind shooting just to bring out enemies.\nHonestly, I really want to like this game because there are so many fun things about it. But even then, the sheer gameplay and hollow story brings the game down. Hotline Miami was never meant to be a gun game with tedious levels and terrible design; it was meant to be fun arcade style mess-em-up with a vague, but compelling story. As much as I want to give this game a good rating, Hotline Miami 2 is ultimately a disappointment that doesn’t live up to its hype.\n","March 14, 2015","false","14.5"," 104 of 167 people (62%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","62","104","167","7","13"

It featured fast paced and very violent gameplay that meshed very well with the game's atmosphere. It felt like a drug trip and the entire game felt like unleashing your aggression on the world.\n\nHotline Miami 2... is all over the place. Unlike the first game, where you mostly played as a single silent protagonist. In HLM2 you change perspectives to a different character basically every level. The problem with this lies in how this necessitated the removal of the mask system. Most of the levels in the game don't allow you to select between different masks. Only very occasionally letting you pick between a different weapon. Because of how often the game changes perspective I never understood what was happening in the storyline. It felt almost like it was intentionally designed to be nonsensical which really made me feel contempt for the whole thing.\n\nThis all would've been fine had it not been HLM2's biggest flaw, which is it's level design. In the original Hotline Miami there was a rhythm to the gameplay, and each level almost felt like a playground. It felt very spontanious and switching between the different masks made replaying a level feel very different every time.\n\nHLM2 on the other hand features much larger maps. Because you usually can't pick a mask at the start, every level feels like it was designed to only have one playstyle in mind. You have to hold the shift key down at all times while playing to move the camera. This is because the game frequently features gun wielding enemies you can't see that instantly kill you. Along with hyper aware enemies behind glass walls that force you to move very slowly. It makes every level feel like trial and error and it makes the difficulty feel very unfair as a result. I don't like sections where I'm forced to use a gun to kill enemies that can't be damaged otherwise. It makes the game feel more repetative and less spontanious as a result.\n\nI honestly don't think HLM2 is all that good. It feels like the developer didn't really have an idea for a sequel so he just phoned in most of it. I might recommend this game once it's map editor comes out but even then, it's vanilla campaign feels like a chore to play through compared to the original.","November 22, 2015","false","8.5"," 142 of 233 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","142","233","3","25"

Hard Mode is literally artificial difficulty: levels are reversed, higher number of Thugs (enemies that need to be shot), you can't lock on to enemies, and guns lose ammunition as you drop them (basically a huge nerf to Jake, who was actually decently fun to play). Different-ish story, though, so I'll be looking to see how that plays out. Seems more interesting than Normal mode's story. I do NOT recommend the design decisions that Dennaton took for Hard Mode.\n\nEdit: So, just finished the game (only required 5.5 hours, so read into that what you will). I won't spoil anything, but holy hell, what a disappointment. I haven't seen an ending this shoddily constructed since "No Country for Old Men." Dennaton should be ashamed. Game feels rushed, unfinished, and as though little serious thought were put into it. The rest of my review holds. Favorite Chapter: 22; Least Favorite Chapter: 11 (with all the Soldier Chapters close nearby)\n\nI'm writing this review as a die-hard Hotline Miami fan, holding several very high scores (i.e., rank < 3000) on several of the levels in Hotline Miami 1; I've played that game to death, and even got good at speedrunning it.\n\nQuite simply, I don't like Hotline Miami 2, but perhaps you will; my bias comes from having loved the gameplay of HM1 so much. Hotline Miami 2 attempts to fix things in the original game that were already perfect; an all-too-common no-no in game design. Hotline Miami 2 isn't a bad game, exactly, and many people will probably have fun with it; it is, however, a very poor sequel to the beloved original title.\n\nNow, for the actual review...\n\nThe goodMusic is absolutely stellar; holy crap, >3 hours of music is well worth the cost of the game alone.\nBlood! Blades! Bullets! The holy trifecta is heavily present in Hotline Miami 2.\nThe badThe story isn't terribly engaging, particularly because it seems too forced and segmented. That said, I certainly intend to play the game all the way through; can't leave a mystery unsolved. You'll be jumping from character to character a lot as well, so don't get too attached to one playstyle. On that note...\nThe characters aren't that great either. Maybe its because I grew used to our silent protagonist of the first title, but the characters of Hotline Miami 2 seem fairly stale.\nHotline Miami 2 took all the unfun things in Hotline Miami and made them more frequent; expect lots of dogs, timely animations that will result in your death, and an abundance of Thugs.\nThe Fans are gimicky. Alex's roll is next to useless (using it to position yourself for a kill is impossible, as enemies will kill you in the standing up animation), Tony is nerfed to hell (can't use guns at all, sometimes doesn't immediately kill dogs, leaving you open for being shot/slashed and killed), Mark cannot melee while he still has anything left in his copious ammo supply, and the Swan Siblings have some pretty impressive pathing issues (oh, and heads up; using the chainsaw on a Thug has a 1-2 second animation during which you can be killed, so you'll have to protect yourself with the other sibling).\nThe uglyLevel design is TERRIBLE. Its almost as though no-to-limited playtesting went into designing the game. Some playstyles will have a huge disadvantage compared to others, particularly those that tend to go loud. This coincides with another grievance of mine: in Hotline Miami, it was fairly well regarded that "Recklessness is rewarded" (hence why there is a tip on the loading screen saying exactly that). In Hotline Miami 2, however, Patience is the name of the game, which seems ironic for a title claiming to offer fast-paced killing-spree combat. Speaking of which...\n"Lure your enemies simulator 2015": Some characters (Tony, Alex, Evan) simply cannot rush through a mission (err..."Scene") killing everything in their wake; instead, its best to let enemies come to them. This eats into your combo potential and into your score potential.\nBuilding off both these points, there's a common theme among the Hotline Miami 2 levels: either have a crapton of open space leaving little room for cover, or have a crapton of random objects that just get in your way if you're trying to move through the level quickly. Again, terrible level design. Leaving a level and going back to your car is as much of a challenge as actually completing the level.\nBugs! Bugs everywhere! Hope you enjoy having a dog jump you through a wall, or Mobsters growing invulnerable as they glitch out in a doorway for several seconds. Best yet, and my personal LEAST favorite of all, some maps can throw you into a wall, preventing you from moving at all (imagine my joy when I had to repeat the entirety of a frustrating mission after completing it, because I spawned in a wall after going down a staircase). Again, Hotline Miami 2 feels fairly ill-playtested.\nSo should you get Hotline Miami 2? Up to you, really. If you can live with a lesser but more-expensive game than Hotline Miami 1 (which, to be fair, is still not without bugs galore), go for it. The soundtrack at least is worth the money, if you're into this kind of music. I like Hotline Miami 2 as a game, truly, just not as a Hotline Miami sequel. When the level editor comes out, I'll probably swap this over to a positive review, simply since I'll be able to start making some more HM1-esque levels. I'll continue to play Hotline Miami 2 through to completion, and probably a bit beyond then too, but in its current state I cannot recommend Hotline Miami 2 to die-hard Hotline Miami fans.","March 10, 2015","false","8.6"," 472 of 811 people (58%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","58","472","811","24","35"

Sweating, hungry and losing sleep for the sake of just beating the game because it was simply that addicting. Hotline Miami 2 is just as good as the original, but offers quite a different experience when compared to it's predecessor.\n\nNow, I wouldn't say this game is better than the first but it's definitely on an even plain.\n\nWhat's new? Alot has changed from the first installment of the series but the core gameplay is still there. While the first Hotline Miami game had around 27 masks while Hotline Miami 2 has around 12.\n"WHAT? WHY DOES HOTLINE MIAMI 2 HAVE LESS THAN HALF THE MASKS OF THE FIRST GAME?!!"Well here's where things get interesting and yes, there is a good reason for this design choice.\nMore weapons.From chainsaw to mini-gun, there's alot of fun to be had here. Unlock more as you play.\n\nHotline Miami 2 is much more story driven than the first taking place directly after the original, it's also much more linear yet broader in terms of overall vision.\n\nWhile the first Hotline Miami gave you the choice to be whoever you wanted, Hotline Miami 2 forces you to adapt to a certain character's playstyle each level. without the freedom of the first. While some people hated this, others like myself enjoyed it for the challenge.\nWe're no longer stuck in apartment buildings this time around... Locales in Hotline Miami 2 vary from sewers to forest to apartments to houses and more. There's alot of variety going on and this helps make the atmosphere and world of Hotline Miami come more alive in my opinion.\n\nThe music is back. One thing I think all Hotline Miami players can agree on is how good the soundtrack is and the sequel is no different, delivering pulsating, adrenaline pumping scores throughout.\n\nThe graphics: The same style of 2D texturing as the original Hotline Miami with bright, colorful and best of all TRIPPY! Not much else to say except that it has it's own thing going on.\n\nA.I has been revamped and patrols are semi-randomized. Enemies hear better, see further, and more importantly, react quicker than they did in the first Hotline Miami!\n\nOverall, this really is a great sequel to one of my most favorite indie games ever. I didn't think they would go this way with the sequel, I would have never expected it. I highly recommend if you want a good challenge.

Prepare yourself for an extended, Hotline Miami-themed cover-based shooter. You are forced to use guns in many of the levels, even though the scoring system still only gives you half the points for firearm kills. Levels are often overly long with lots of open space and way too many gun-toting or melee-proof hostiles to get creative. Pressing R to Restart has never been a more painful experience. This not to say there aren't some great moments in the game that recapture the magic of the original, but they're fleeting.

All the maps are vast and spacious, to the extent that you typically can't see the other end of a hallway if you try to look.

This meant a lot of the time I was playing far more cautiously because I couldn't run through the levels quickly like the first game and trying new strategies for getting big combos. Because of the randomness of the gun enemies I kind of just went from room to room hoping the enemies would be in the right position so I wouldn't get shot, so overall it was less fun than the first game where you could get very precise. It was very annoying being shot through a window because an enemy had moved there when you fired a gun and in the last death he wasn't there. The first game was challenging but it was also fairer, because it felt like when I died it was my own mistake in mistiming, whereas in the second game I often died because I got shot by an enemy off screen had shot me, often through a window and I had no way of knowing they were there. The large level design doesn't help that I get shot from off screen and enemies can you see. Its just really cheap compared to the first.\n\nThe storyline also felt was misguided in that it overexplains things that happen in the first game and was too easy to follow. I liked how the first game was simple in the plot and the second game adds a lot of characters and lore that I felt didn't really work with the first game. The ending was cool though.\n\nHowever the music and aesthetic are just as good and you can still have some fun with it at times. Its not a bad game, its just overshadowed by the first in a lot of ways. If would only recommend it to fans of the first game who want more levels, for anybody else I would say just play the first one.","February 13","false","8.9"," 32 of 47 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","32","47","2","2"

Hotline is NOT Five Nights at BleachShots, this isn't a game where you frantically try to piece together a non-existant story. Hotline is a game with a set story that you'll never figure out. It is a game of unique-ness, and most of all a game of greatness.\n\nHotline Miami 2: Wrong Number is the second and final (excluding the upcoming fan-made mod, Midnight Animal) addition to the Hotline Miami series. In other words, Jonatan and Dennis know when to end a game. It differs from the original game, with now multiple protagonists to play as (all of whom tie in with each other) with varying playstyles (kinda.) The game also features Hard Mode, which inverts all of the levels, as well as adding harder baddies to fight. You will have to work to 100% this game, much more than you will for Hotline 1, and that's the pure beauty of it. It might bs you at times with off-screen enemies, but that's just how the Hotline games are supposed to work. Hotline Miami isn't based on luck, it's based on map recognition and memorization, trial and error is a must here. Don't let that turn you away though, just go ahead and enjoy this masterpiece.","April 29","true","60.3"," 30 of 44 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","30","44","3","0"

Do you enjoy a bit of challenge. Do you consider yourself a masochist? Then get ready to press R for reset! Cause here comes Hotline Miami 2!\n\nThis game is just plain out amazing. It's satisfying to kill enemies, racking up combos, and frustratingly easy to get killed. When I think about Hotline Miami, I think about how easy it is to get killed. And that is a good thing, cause this isn't a Run and Gun game. This game is all about being strategic, planning ahead, getting a good idea of what is waiting for you. Otherwise you are going to die a lot until you learn from your mistakes and get better.\n\nThe story continues off where Hotline Miami 1 left off. The main character (who is refereed to as Jacket according to Payday 2) now lives in infamy for taking on the Russian mafia. Thus introduces the cast of characters: a group of people trying to impersonate Jacket to earn some fame, a crooked detective that takes care of cases his own way, and an author researching about the Chicken Masked man, and a group of soldiers in Hawaii... huh... and a few other characters.\n\nSo instead of many different masks you instead get to play as many different characters who have their own way of killing people. My personal favorite is Ash and Alex who are pretty much two characters in one, one kills people with a chainsaw, the other shoots. The levels are also large and expansive which can be bad since there is sometimes not a lot of cover, so you'll get shot pretty easily, especially if your playing as Tony one of the masked bandits that can only melee enemies. Sometimes you'll need to be on your toes in case the next area has a guy not to far from where you came from. Like I said before your not going to get far from just rushing, you need to plan ahead and know where the enemies are at, and what you might attract if you start shooting. And once you get a good plan put together you'll be killing people without a scratch.\n\nAlso the music and the graphics are just fantastic!\n\nAlso on a extra note: when you start the game it will ask you if you want to skip and sexual content that is shown in the game, course if you were following the news you'll know what to expect. And as far as I know there is only one instance of any sexual content.\n\nIn conclusion Hotline Miami 2 has its flaws. Sometimes you'll breeze through a level, other times you'll get shot by a guy you didn't see or didn't expect, but in the end you'll be satisfied as you walk back to your car passing by all the dead bodies of every single person you have single handedly killed.\n\nFinal Rating: Bloody Amazing!","March 14, 2015","true","7.9"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","22","30","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Grabbed/recommended/274170/","Grabbed","Grabbed_by_the_spetsnaz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Grabbed/","143 products in account","(long review, lot of words, if you want it summed up quickly, skip to my final conclusions)\n\nI really want to love this game, I really do!\n\nI am a humongous fan of the first game, playing it over and over again, challenging friends to speedruns, finding the secrets without any help and so on. So naturally, I was pants creamingley excited over this game! So this review really comes from the heart.\n\nThis game has tried to trump what made itself good in the first game, but unfortunately falls short by quite the margin. There's alot to talk about so I'll put the main points in bullets.\n\n- Story: One of the biggest downfalls to this game. While the first game was a simple, straightforward story with a mysterious, convoluted ark to it which bred alot of speculation, Hotline 2's is a jumbled mess! It leaves off with jackets ending and subsequent arrest. It follows a sleuth of other people who have devived or been influenced form his actions, unfortunately, this ends up being a jumbled mess, with many character arc's ending before any development could be made (and you'd be surprised who's!), or simply leading to no where. Worst of all, avoiding spoilers, the ending turns into a total Deus Ex Machina to what would otherwise be a fulfilling-yet-unexceptional ending. After the game, I franticallylooked around, maybe there was a super secret I'm missing! A hidden ending to the arcs! A secret back story that will tie this in that I'm surely missing! Unfortunately, at this moment, I'm mistaken... And that saddens me greatly\n\n- Level design: Possibly the biggest culprit for me, there was an insatiable need for this game to be "Harder" by the developers but they've done this the completely wrong way! Long hallways with shotgun wielding foes who see you before you can see them, rooms packed full of gunners for melee centric of forced characters relying on sheer luck in order to finish! RNG spawns that are going to make speedrunners scream, as sometimes your going to need to restart entire levels because the RNG placed a shogunner right in-front of the spawn position! Too many bad decisions which rely too much on luck an cheese tactics in order to beat! Now don't get me wrong, some levels are ♥♥♥♥ing FANTASTIC, the prison level and last level come to mind! But these are few and far between and are over far too soon!\n\nAn example I'd like to give is one of Tony's levels, a character who can use only his fists to kill people, the first part of the level you're stuck in a big room, much like a pit fighter ring, and you fight swarms of melee enemies by the droves! some of them needing an extra hit while their down in order to finally die, it's challenging, frantic and ♥♥♥♥ing satisfying once you pull it off! Unfortunately it the proceeds to give you a room full of firearm enemies behind cover you can't move over, the level suddenly turns from a fast and frantic and reflex based, to a slow crawl trying not to get shot from off the screen, and what was fun soon becomes a rudimentary obstacle that you need to get past the ♥♥♥♥ing level.\n\n- Gameplay: very much derivative of the first, would have been a surefire winner for me, but unfortunately it's dragged down with the rest of this game! Many characters seem unique at first, but some characters are (literally) killed off before you've even unlocked their full abilities, others are carbon copies of different characters! and others, such as the novelists, are completely disregarded to the point of serving no purpose except for a little achievement in the end.\n\n- Soundtrack: ♥♥♥♥ing... Beautiful, expanding their soundtrack to well over 2 hours of music, trippy beats! various artists! Better than most AAA games out there, and a definite improvement on the already great soundtrack of the first game!\n\n- Value: about $15 dollars and the game will be over in I'd say 4.5 hours to an average player, a pretty good value if you ask me.\n\n- Overall thoughts: The developers promised this game would be bigger, badder and flashier than ever! And this game feels like them tripping over themselves in order to fulfill the promise. Sure it's bigger, sure is badder, sure it's more challenging.... But it's not fun.... And that, most of all, is what I wanted most out of a Hotline Miami game!\n\nIt breaks my heart to say this, but I can not recommend to those new and the hardened fans (hue) alike.","March 14, 2015","false","16.2"," 136 of 237 people (57%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","57","136","237","9","3"

If you thought you were hot ♥♥♥♥ because you wore a chicken mask and beat the Russians down with ease, Hotline Miami 2 is here to thoroughly disabuse you of that notion by starting off at the difficulty level reached at the end of Hotline Miami and AMPING IT UP FROM THERE.\n\nThe developers have stated this is the last game for the franchise, and they've taken every opportunity to mess with the set dressing. Level layouts are larger, which means you need to be absolutely careful of where you're going lest you get shot by a dude with a gun through a window (which kind of breaks the flow of the fury-murders). Not only that, but there's new types of enemies, including the kind of crazy ♥♥♥♥er near the end of the game that blends in with the environment that you can't kill with gunshots that runs really really fast at you that you have to throw something at and then ♥♥♥♥ing murder his crazy ♥♥♥♥ing face while he's down, JESUS CHRIST just thinking about that guy sets my hairs on end.\n\nIt's not like Hotline Miami where you get to choose from all sorts of different masks, instead the game cycles you through several different characters over the course of the story, and they either play close to the original or have special powers/restrictions (such as Tony's Fists of Fury (Killing punches, no weapons), or Evan's Fists of Don't Push Me Over The Edge Or All Of You Are Going To ♥♥♥♥ing Die). There's one character out of the bunch who sucks, and his name is The Soldier. The Soldier is really fussy and will only use the weapon he brings onto the battlefield, because he won't deign to touch the fully loaded Automat Kalashnikovs dropped by the soldiers he kills, and he will only reload his gun with 5.56mm and shotgun shell ammo stolen from USSR branded ammo crates. This is behavior I expect from the Valley Girl Soldier Squad, not a special ops soldier who goes out on one-man military sponsored murder sprees. No wonder America lost the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ war in this game.\n\nSo yeah, Hotline Miami 2 is mechanically sloppier than its predecessor, but that's fine. The atmosphere more than makes up for it. What I liked about Hotline Miami was its unorganized, hallucinatory atmosphere and storytelling, and the game continues that in spades, adopting a sort of Pulp Fiction-esque structure and a home video slasher ambiance to flesh out the backstory. It's not going to tell you the story outright, and it's not going to be a pretty ending for everyone involved. But the thing is, there's a bunch of little details that you'll pick up on if you're observant, and those little details help connect the web of the story in unexpected ways, changing little details, and in one instance, unlocking a secret level. Of course, you don't have to if you don't want to. The end won't change too much, and it will be just as ugly.\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is JUST AS AMAZING AS THE FIRST ONE. I did myself the disservice of looking it up on YouTube months in advance of the game's release, and because of that the impact of that music was dulled, and that felt like a sadness. But that does not make the soundtrack any less awesome - there's 49 different music tracks from many talented and (somewhat) obscure artists, and not a single one sucks. You will enrich your life by throwing yourself at the artist Soundcloud and Bandcamp pages after you finish the game.\n\nHotline Miami 2 is the kind of sequel that Portal 2 was - it doesn't quite live up to its predecessor, but that doesn't make it any less worthy of your time. I would actually recommend that you become familiar with the first Hotline Miami, because this game is not going to wait for you to get up to speed with it. It will kick your ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥.","March 11, 2015","true","16.8"," 62 of 103 people (60%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","60","62","103","10","0"

After the first game I was incredibly psyched to be playing this one. More characters, levels, etc, seemed like a great deal. This game has 2 MAJOR issues that upset me deeply every time I play it.\n\n1- general level design. In the first game, you could look, figure out what was going on in other rooms, and deal accordingly. The levels in this are far more intricate, more windows, more open spaces, and long corridors, which make it really hard to judge what enemies are doing off camera and where it's safe to be.\n\n2- AI. The first game's AI was very consistent and predictable, meaning that if you attempted to do something one run that worked, it would almost definitely work again if you replicated it. This is not the case with Hotline Miami 2. Enemies often seem to notice or ignore you at random, and *especially* if you're playing as a character that needs to lure enemies more? A massive amount of finishing a level comes down purely to LUCK.\n\nIn short this game's level design is severly lacking in comparison to the first's and has unpredictable AI that lend the game less to player skill and more to pure chance. Not satisfying and constantly very frustrating, and NOT in the same way as the first game.","February 12","false","9.3"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

I do not kid when I say that some levels took me 300-400 tries; HM1 was not even remotely close to being this repetitive and frustrating.  This is not because HM2 is “hard” or “challenging,” It's because it's shamelessly tedious and hardly balanced.\n\nMany people complain about getting sniped by off-screen baddies.  While this is true, it did not bother me too much, as you can still hide most of the time, and I rather enjoyed the large maps.\n\nWhat sucks about this game is how so many levels require nothing but pure LUCK.  Not skill, practice, tact, strategy, timing, etc..  Just luck.  For example, melee fighting is almost entirely a crapshoot; timing and skill play almost no part to the potential for victory - it’s random.\n\nI’ve put 24 hours into this because I tend to get OCD with games and strive to finish them.  But this is hardly a game - it’s WORK.\n\nI really want to love this game and give it a thumbs up, because the shootouts can sometimes be incredible.  But the vast majority of your time is spent trying to lure baddies somewhere so that you can melee them, and since the success of each melee fight is mostly random and based on luck, you will be waiting / luring / melee / dying over and over again, many hundreds of times for many levels.","May 23","false","42.6"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

Hotline Miami 2 is getting reviewed (half a year later) and I will just start off with the TL;DR for anyone with the attention span of a 30-minute-old baby:\n\nTL;DR\n\nHotline Miami 2 is not only a sequel in literally every conceivable way in comparison to the original: bigger, bolder, better graphics, music, audio, enemy variety, level design (you ♥♥♥♥in' heard me), story and a billion other things I probably can't remember right now, but also in the top 3 games of 2015 (out of all 3, I frankly can't really decide which of the 3 is the best, one day I may pick after all ^^)!\n\nPROS:+ The Campaign is much longer! While HM1 could be done in 2.5-3 hours, HM2 will take between 6.5-8 hours (Steam told I took 7.0 exact hours).\n+ The story, while being pretty much (not all of it, but most) an explanation of the weird plot that HM1 was, is fresh enough and twisting enough to be better in pretty much all factors and  is one of the best storylines of the year.\n+ Improved sprites and animations  make it a welcome addition to the sequel in comparison to HM1\n+ Levels are now MUCH bigger and, in general, ALOT longer,  though some fans will not appreciate this change. Some have gone to great lengths to bash the game just because of this instead of... you know... "gitting gud"...\n+ The soundtrack is a billion times better than anything put in the original's in my opinion!\n+ More weapon and enemy variety, same for setting: you will hop through various events in time, changing the environments GREATLY!\n+ Hard Mode is a phenomenal addition to the sequel!\n+ No TRAUMA-like level from HM1 <3\n+ Hard but fun achievements and a scoring system that motivates repetition.\n\nCONS:- Some of the 'Nam levels feel unbalanced in Hard Mode (one in particular if you spend your whole ammo count, you're ♥♥♥♥ out of luck as there's no stash to get it back and the fat brutes can't die from melee).\n- No music player in-game. You'll have to play a specific level to hear that song and it will repeat because the music doesn't play as if it was a radio. Rather disappointing.\n-  Evan Wright's levels aren't that much fun as it goes against everything HM stands for, though they are vital and fun to play for the story.\n\n(and the subway level with him is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome! #ComboKing)\n\n- Just under 1 ♥♥♥♥ing year for the level editor! What the hell? It was almost done ON RELEASE!!\n- It ends.\n\nACTUAL REVIEW\n\nSTORY\nI won't say ♥♥♥♥ about the story as I want to avoid as many spoilers as humanly possible, but the premise is this:\n\nA bunch of kids with Jacket's (the protagonist of the original) wallpapers all over their rooms want to imitate his killing sprees as "killing's fun" and stuff...\n\nThese won't be the only ones you'll meet and play as in the story. Oh no, no, no!! But to avoid any further info and keep the mystery alive, I'll shut up and  claim Hotline Miami's story is probably the best of the year, not only starting, but ending very strong  (though many did not like the ending, imo it fit really well). It's confusing, jarring and jaw-dropping. Some of you may need to read an explanation. But first (like the original) I recommend you try as hard as possible to piece it all YOURSELF and THEN check the online explanation/theory/guides.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nMuch like the first, you have a weapon (melee or ranged), all of which kill in 1-2 shots (except the big fat dudes). You will also die in 1-2 shots, like the original game.  This renders the game a very hardcore experience, especially in the brand new Hard Mode which is insanely, frustrantingly, painfully difficult.\n\nFair? Yes.\nFun? Y...Yes (hides scars)\n\nFans of the 1st probably already played the sequel (and if you haven't, shame!), but those who haven't will be pleased to know the masks are back (though reduced) and one of the new characters includes a proficiency system (works like the masks, you pick 1 of 4 at the start of the level. Disappointingly enough, the proficiencies have the same effects as the damn masks from the other characters!\n\nOverall, a skillful game worth it for hardcore gamers looking for a massive challenge.\n\nSOUND/GRAPHICS\nThe game's soundtrack is the best of year, even beating the excellent Metal Gear Solid 5. Also one of the best ever made (easily in my personal top 3 soundtracks ever conceived). Perfect punch during action and mystery during story bits. Couldn't think of a better way to end the sequel than with an OST that is MIIIIIIIIIILES AWAY better than the original's rather average and forgettable soundtrack. Guns and melee got a sound overhaul, especially new guns. They feel and sound perfect. Great punch and sound assets used.\n\nGraphically it's a retro top down game. Much like the first, uses a GameMaker based Engine. The game is NOTABLY improved graphically, with alot more gore and an overall more polished look.\n\nOVERALL\nI do not think there is much more I can say about this game and the franchise... The first was great, the 2nd is a masterpiece. The level design got MASSIVE criticism from the fans and I cannot say they don't have a point. Indeed they do. However the argument " Oh, HM's all about small corridors and fast twitch shooting" not only ALSO applies to the sequel (don't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t me and say otherwise) but also is kinda invalid as the sequel tried so much new that expanded even the level design. Criticism about the long LOF is trivial as it gives a slower (but perfect and adequate) pace to the game, without ruining the fast shooting the franchise is so known for.\n\nConsidering how almost everything got improved (except the small "poor" additions (Evan Wright's levels for example (which aren't many thankfully)) and a couple of bugs (saw a guy literally run from 1 edge of the map to me going through every mother♥♥♥♥in' wall like he's Jesus Christ! LMAO)), I see no reason for Hotline Miami 2 not getting anything lower than a 9.5/10 in a world where everyone hates math except in review scores... go figure, huh?! -_-\n\nAnyway I digress. Hope you liked the review, get me dem thumbs up and go buy the damn game already! 15€ is more than worth it!!","March 20","true","22.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","3"

Forget about masks, this game features about 9 characters that have their own equipment(or none whatsoever) and playstyle. Meaning there's not much choice to be had.\n\nBiggest problem in the game are AI, enviroment and doors. AI gets stuck on doors and spins in circles giving them infinite invulnerability frames. There's a two man character that includes melee and gun option which seems like a cool idea but the concept fails because one of them is following you and gets stuck on walls doors and so on. Besides that when you're going to lure in enemies(and you will have to) they will get hit by doors no matter what you're using melee or guns leading to dropping your combo.\n\nStory has issues because of many characters that they did not develop. It was also scattered for unnecessary reasons, just to make things more complex to understand. They tried to make something out of it but didn't know where to go half-way, ending it before it could reveal itself.\n\nOverall it's a good game but isn't so polished as first, music is still a blast though.\nI wish steam had mixed recommendation because my feelings neither negative nor positive.","March 15, 2015","true","17.6"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","18","26","2","0"

Even halfway in the game, I still\nbarely understood what the ♥♥♥♥ the story was about. Or I guess that also has to do with the fact that I just didnt care much about the story.\n\nSOUNDTRACK:\nThe music is just great but hardly anything that stands out. It aptly accomodates the whacked atmosphere of the game.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe 'scenes', the actual gameplay, is what makes HLM1 so exceptional. In HLM2, the devs decided to take a different spin on the action, all of which has only impeded the game's quality.\nPerhaps one of the most noticeable change here is the significantly more open level design.\nNumerous enemies patrol large open spaces that make you one big walking target for them.\nTo assist the player, the game gives you ability to look beyond your FOV. Seems useful, but not\nwhen enemies have an eagle vision even wider than yours. It's easy to get killed out of nowhere\nwhen enemies can spot and snipe you, even when completely out of your screen's expanded view.\nHow can you even scan across your environemnt 360 to ensure complete safety while also shooting enemies in front of you? You can't.\n\nMost annoying in the enitre game is the utter lack of customisation given to players.\nControls are not quite as fluid and hindered by unresponsiveness and inconsistency.\nWant to try executing that guy lying helplessly on the floor? *presses spacebar, yet nothing happens.\nPress again after 2 more tries, the player finally goes for the execution too late as another enemy comes and whacks you dead.\nWant to pick up that handy baseball bat lying right below your feet? Nope, the game makes you pick up this useless gun without ammo lying nearby instead.\nRun out of ammo and need that fresh new machinegun over there? Nope, the game makes you pick up some puny knife instead.\nI don't know how the devs even thought it was a good idea to limit the controls so much, they even have the key binding for executions being the same key for the Corey's Dodge/Roll key binding (which btw is a very useless ability).\n\nAnd the crosshair...the crosshair...it's annoying as ♥♥♥♥ to deal with.\nThe devs have stubbornly chose to keep the crosshair white, a color suitable for some levels, not for others. In bright levels like Stronghold, the crosshair near completely camofladges with the background, making it extremely frustrating trying to play through the level.\nSimply offering some crosshair customisation option would have fixed this nicely. Again, the devs didnt bother.\nYou know what else they didnt bother? No brightness setting, no gamma setting, no video settings at all. Howdo hoo, whereas all other games out there would offer at least these crucial settings, the only thing this game allows you to customize is its very, very limited controls.\n\nThis proves in the final Act 6 level Catastrophe, where Dennaton once again thinks it'd be 'challenging' to make a level so ♥♥♥♥ing dark, enemies like the black dogs and large black thugs are almost invisible to the naked eye yet are able to spot you from afar like it's in f***king daytime.\n\nIt doesnt help that I dont have that good of an eyesight, the lack of any gamma setting simply made me falling prey to such a disadvantage.\nIt doesnt matter how good the player's skill is, if you cant even see the ♥♥♥♥ing crosshair or the enemies, that's just extremely BS game design.\n\n\nFurthermore disappointing is the removal of several masks from the original game, all for the sake of the story.\nIn fact for most of the levels, you dont even play with a mask. This all depends on the characters\nyou are forced to play as. Playing as 'The Fans' give you the most options on picking masks but\nfor all other levels, you're pretty much forced to play by the set rules.\n\n\nCONCLUSION:\nIn Hotline Miami 2, Dennaton Games tried aiming high on target but instead hits all places wrong.\nBeing quite a fan since the first game, having played to the fullest and achieved plenty of A grades and even S grades, this wonderful sequel has only managed to turn my initial enthusiasm into regret and dismay.\n\nWith its unpredictably bad and half-♥♥♥♥♥ lazy level design, unfixed bugs and glitches of enemies clipping and utter crap controls and options available, HM2 has made it more of a huge annoyance to  get through than a game to enjoy anymore.\n\n\nPROS:\n+ Music is the same great list of soundtracks.\n+ A more ambitious story\n\nCONS:\n- Sh****t open level design\n- Controls are unresponsive and badly implemented\n- Lack of choices, lack of masks\n- Intentional lighting issues of some levels being too bright, others being way too dark\n- - Too unpolished and rushed, with too many bugs and clipping issues in levels\n\n\nSCORE: 2/5","February 12","false","10.5"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

The camera feels much more zoomed in for HM2 then it did in 1 and as a result enemies easily snipe you from off your screen, which becomes very frustrating after a while.   I feel like half the fight in this game is combating the aweful camera and camera controls.\n\nThe actual combat is just as good and satisifying as HM1 if not better.   The different characters/masks you can choose per level also makes the game more varied and interesing then HM1.  That being said if the camera issue was fixed (which at this point seems to be by design) the game would be an easy thumbs up for me.  However, because the camera is so terribly frustrating to work with it makes the game unfun and just a headache for me to play.\n\ntldr,\nterrible camera/camera controls\ngreat combat and varied styles\n\nOk to pick up on sale.

[Original review: March 12th]\n\n\nSo here it is, the brutal conclusion to a brutal series...\n\nYes, Wrong Number is easily the most brutal game I have ever played and I don't say that lightly. Not only that, but it concludes my favourite indie game series of all time. Perfectly. With the mystery that shadows Hotline Miami 1, Wrong Number answers all of these questions. And you're gonna be shocked alot as the storyline unfolds. The savage raids and executions done by the fans, will tackle what you originally thought was acceptable in HM1, and soon you'll realize that this is a very different game. Wrong Number is alot more darker, and by this, I mean there is more of a sense of right and wrong with characters decisions (no spoilers). Considering the first game was 90% mindless violence, 2 explores depth and story, but believe me, the violence is still in full swing... Infact the violence sometimes feels ugly and dark, and you're not sure if your actions are good or bad... The storyline is alot more indepth, as it illustrates the timeline of many characters and events alot more than the first Hotline Miami did, but it does include some familiar faces, or should I say masks... This game is DEFINITELY for people who completed HM1. It's tougher. Way tougher. The maps are bigger, levels are longer and there's plenty of people to get through.\n\nIt serves as a prequel and a sequel (or, basically to quote Borderlands - a pre-sequel). But that's it, no more about the storyline - I'm dodging spoilers as much as possible. But I will say this... the twins are alot of fun to play as...\n\nIn fact, my favourite thing about Wrong Number is The Fans. Every mission I played as a member of the group, I had a blast. Especially with the Twins. Total chaos. My least favourite is probably The Bear - the guns and arm control are pretty cool, but there were moments where I wanted to throw my guns down and beat the hell out of someone. With the twins, you have both! Left = guns, right = chainsaw. That's a win/win right there... Tony is pretty awesome too, but enemies standing in awkward spots with machine guns can be a buzz kill as you can't pick up ANY weapons. The Zebra I rate just below The Bear, the rolling skill is pretty useful, but only in unique moments (handling small group of enemies). Where as with the Twins - guns can be the dinner bell and the chainsaw and the kill = perfect.\n\nThe game is alot more complete and wholesome compared to HM1. In my opinion, the soundtrack is alot more punchy and fits the action and pace perfectly. The feel and mechanics of the game remain intact, however each character has its own unique skills and rather than controlling 1 character with a range of favourited masks, instead you have to master each character's preferences and get used to their style. More weapons, play modes and 'replay-value' achievements, and of course the upcoming level editor make the game feel even more complete (SPRING SPRING SPRING).\n\nThe hype for this game has been very intense - fake phonelines, figures, clothing, digital comics and for a select few, a special edition vinyl box-set. Wrong Number is the more professional out of the 2 games and its promotion has had alot to do with it! You should play this series AT LEAST 4 times (in my opinion) - Hotline Miami and Wrong Number on Steam AND Vita. Steam because its the original experience, and Vita because its gameplay is superbly smooth...\n\nIt is a shame to know this is the end, but at the same time, this concludes the series perfectly. Hotline Miami is a modern-day classic. And even though some might not agree, it ended perfectly. And finally, to answer your question, yes. I do like hurting other people.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW FOR HOTLINE MIAMI 1.\n\n"I've been meaning to play this for a while. Finally got around to it, thanks to a sale. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. Extremely challenging, but extremely rewarding when you complete a level. The eerie soundtracks perfectly match the retro/8-bit bloodbath with the essence of neon neo-noir. Also, buy this if you're a fan of the film Drive, like me."\n\nThank you Dennaton for (50) blessing(s) us with this masterpiece. Hotline Miami is my Watchmen of indie games.\nHappy hunting.","March 15, 2015","true","47.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/recommended/274170/","gamerrubrix","Gamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/","300 products in account","EDIT: I want to clarify this: I don't think Hotline 2 is a bad game by any means, it's still good on it's own, but I believe it doesn't match the level that Miami 1 had. It does have very fine points and better attributes than Miami 1, such as being longer and more variety. But as a lover of the first, it doesn't do justice for me. Not hating.\n\nThis was difficult to determine... But I came up with my answer.\n\nHotline Miami 2 is the sequal to the high-octane, action-packed original from a few years ago. Miami 1 turned out to be one of my favorite games of all time, so I was very excited when I saw that a supposed bigger and better sequal was going to be announced.\n\nHowever, it didn't become that. And here's why: The level design and it's overall structure... And then some. Read on if you're curious.\n\nI should go over the pros first, shouldn't I? Well, the positives I can say about this game is that it has a bigger and better story, much more varied and bigger levels, new masks, and another good soundtrack. Most levels in Miami 1 were very simple and left lots of room for creativity, simple and effective, I loved it. This one is different though, boasting more characters to play as, with bigger stages, and more missions in general. I guess you can say it's more fleshed out.\n\nThere's also a "hard mode" after you beat the game, which is definitely not for the faint of heart if you thought normal mode was too difficult. It's really just for the diehard machoists with features like disabled lock-on, guns with half their clip size, more enemies, more windows, and inverted views.\n\nThere's 5 new masks, and 2 returning masks, which are Tony and Jake. They have pretty interesting attributes and spice up the gameplay in the levels that the "fans" are in. You also have many characters to choose from, each with their different abilities. The detective can ground kill with guns, the writer can unload guns and quickly eliminate foes without killing, the soldier has an arsenal of weapons, each with a reserve clip unlike regular guns, The fans; which are the masked guys, and much, much more. Each of them have their own levels, and the game kinda just evenly splits them up. So variety is in there, and that's a good thing.\n\nYou might also be engrossed in the story as it expands and touches upon all these characters, making for one big episodic adventure. Also, I shouldn't have to mention the soundtrack, it's still very impressive just like the original. However, I don't think it's as good as Miami 1's though, but still good.\n\n\n\n\nNow the negatives... They mostly negate the positives here. And there are many. For one, the level design is by far the biggest problem I got.\n\nSee, levels are bigger, yeah? Although some are boxed in and confined like Miami 1, but even that fails to make a good impression. The big levels suffer GREATLY from you being shot off-screen from somewhere where you couldn't see the enemy, especially in the soldier levels. There's also many big levels where enemies patrol the area, and they're always in very wide open spots, so you always need to be super careful when trying to go around the level so you're not shot up, and they're everywhere, so baby steps need to be taken, resulting in an overall slow and tedious level where you just need to snipe enemies with guns or lure them in a corner.\n\nSpeaking of weapons, melee weapons really take a backseat in this installment, because most of your time will be handling guns. Now don't get me wrong, I don't hate using guns, but there HAS to be a balance in between the two, and melees are hardly used, much less ground kills with melees. There's alot less of them in each level, and again, the way the levels are built, you will not find many uses for them, making them rather obslete. Kind of upsetting.\n\nSmaller boxed in levels really just turn into a big game of baiting as you have to lure enemies around a corner so they run at you and you kill them. There are many scenarios like this where you are forced to bait because you either have no room to make a quick kill, or there are too many enemies around that'll see you. This ruins the creativity and flow the Miami 1 had, there are simply too many enemies to go out and do your own thing without getting shot up, so you HAVE to stick to your walls and pick them off just fast enough to keep your combo going. I also should mention your combo window is marginally larger than in Miami 1, around the time you wear the Zack mask to put things in perspective. Obviously, that reflects the sluggish, painfully slow nature you need to pull of in your baiting abilities. This is especially prominent on hard mode too, where levels are filled to the brim with windows.\n\nThe overall structure of the levels is very linear, too. Which also messes with your creativity. You don't have many big boxy areas like you did with Miami 1, but straight corridors with a corner or two, and sometimes a small box area where you can do some creativity, but you can't go out too far or you're shot by that dude in the window 10 feet away.\n\nFor where there is variety, there's also lacking variety at the same time. For such an important role the masks had in the first game, they REALLY took a backseat from this game to compensate for all the characters you play as. Out of the 26 levels in the game, you only play around 5 as the fans. The first couple being easy, simple levels. The masks are a trademark of the series we know, and they offered a spice of variety for the same stage; doing something different. Here, most levels are restricted to just one character, and the way the levels are structured, doing it in a very linear way with little variety to be had.\n\nFor you achievement hunters out there looking for that A+, you better hope you don't die too much, because your *total* time spent in the level (Counting your deaths) is now a part of your overall score. That is absolutely absurd. This is a game of trial and error. Doing it the best possible way, but trying and trying again to achieve that goal. Having this as a part of your score to earn a grade is completely backwards, and has no reason to be in here, making it more difficult for high grades.\n\n\n\n\nSo basically, in the end, the structure of the levels is a massive issue with the game, and not a design choice I agree with. Hotline 2 may be bigger and larger than Miami 1, but it most certainly does not perform better in it's nature of being a fast paced brutal action game where your quick wits solve the problem efficiently, not baiting corners and slowly traversing the area. It's a step backwards. There may be some redeeming factors, but it doesn't do enough justice as this is a linear, rather disappointing installment in the finale of the series.\n\n6/10","April 6, 2015","false","43.8"," 85 of 153 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","85","153","2","24"

The screens/maps are A LOT bigger.\n2. Melee is pretty worthless now. (goodbye tony)\n3. A lot more focus on the story.\n4. Fewer masks, but now you play as more than just 2 characters.\n5. The Level Editor\n_______\nSo number 1; the levels are very big in Hotline 2. Which means you really have to be very cautious because you may get shot from someplace you can't see. Some say it causes unfair deaths but since most enemies have guns you'll be able to make it through, just don't play it like how you played in Hotline 1. And since the maps are big and most enemies have guns, it leads me to my second point.\n___\nNumber 2; Melee is pretty garbage, Tony, sadly is worthless... and you won't find yourself playing as him unless you want to play peek-a-boo around corners all day. The reason for melee being worthless is number 1: most maps are huge and most enemies have guns. Put both of those problems together and you'll be only picking up guns.\n___\nNumber 3; There is a lot more story in Hotline 2, which is a good thing, because it lead to there being more characters but also the story is great too. I don't want to spoil any of it, but the game takes place before, during, and after the first game.\n___\nNumber 4; You don't play as a single person with many masks in Hotline 2, you play as...\nBeard (From the first game, which is really cool. His parts to the story are awesome)\nManny Pardo (Best character, starts with a shotgun in his trunk and can use gun takedowns)\nEvan Wright (Also best character, when you begin the stage he will only knock out enemies, not kill them. But if you choose to beat an enemy on the ground more than 2 times, he will kill him, kill 2 enemies like this and Evan will tear off his shirt and be able to kill like normal)\nThe Fans (which are labeled below and ends at 'Mark')\nCorey (can perform rolls to dodge bullets and melee attacks)\nTony (one punch kills, but can't pick up any weapons, he's bad in the game as already established)\nAlex, and Ash, bro and sis (you play as both these characters, one weilds a chainsaw while the other can pick up and fire weapons, their basicly easy mode as is Mark.)\nMark (duel wield MP5's, he's the best for speed runs. Hold down the right mouse button and he'll move his MP5's to each of his sides, which is actually pretty useful in many moments if used right.)\nThe Henchman (starts with a silenced pistol and only has only one level sadly)\nJake (from the fitst game, the lethal throw mask, start with a nail gun mask, and inner warrior mask which means he plays like Tony)\nMartin Brown (starring as the Pig Butcher, plays normally like jacket but slower)\nRichter (from the first game, has very fun levels and interesting depth behind him, plays like jacket)\nThe Son (son of the russian mob boss, he is only one person but you can chose between The Fans gimmicks)\n*Plus Jacket and Biker are returning for the level editor. Jacket being able to use all of his masks from the first game in the level editor.\n___\nNumber 5; The long anticipated level editor... Goes into Beta Dec/10/15, and will be removed later the same winter and then released shortly after. All characters, masks, and anyone you played in both of the Hotline Miami games will be playable here. All items, furniture pieces, and weapons, will be in the level editor. You will also be able to make multiple floors on your stages. But sadly you will not be able to put in your own music in these levels due to copyright. You will be able to share your own and play others levels after the beta when the full version is released.\\nEDIT***********\nLevel Editor is now in beta, it is buggy as hell and if you wanted to buy this game only for the editor, you'll need to wait a little longer.\n9/10 until crashing bugs are fixed\n","December 10, 2015","true","15.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

So much so that I even felt I had to write a review (something I've never done before).\n\nLike many others have pointed out before, Hotline Miami 2 is lacking in almost every respect when compared to HM 1.\n\nYou are constantly fighting enemies off screen, unloading guns down hallways and huge rooms hoping to kill enemies you cannot see because if you don't, they will kill you immediately. As a result, you are constantly moving around looking for enemies off screen who will snipe you. It's tedious and doesn't feel in the spirit of the first game which was frantic but still felt fair.\n\nCheesing the AI plays a much larger role too, since there are so many enemies armed with firearms, that your best bet is to lure them into kill rooms and just unload your magazine into the doorway. While this also true in part for HM 1, it was mostly a last resort. In HM 2 you'll find yourself using this tactic much more often, which has never been the fun part of the game.\n\nThe fun part was to plan how to tackle each room in advance and then try to execute that plan with precision and speed. Now most rooms are full of gunmen some of which you can't even see, so you are forced to either shoot them all, or again lure them into a funnel or kill room. No variety there.\n\nThis also aplies to amount of melee weapons in the game. MUCH less choices there and thus less variety in the execution  animations.\n\nAlso, AI doesn't seem as consistent anymore. Shooting a gun won't automatically make everyone run towards where you are, making it much easier to get away with not being stealthy. Even so the game seems more difficult, but it does so because of the wrong reasons: larger levels focused on gunplay, much more enemies. It all becomes more focused on twitch reactions, not on planning and executing.\n\nWhile presentation overall is still great, the sequel takes a poor direction in terms of design in my opinion. Just replay part 1.","March 13, 2015","false","9.1"," 108 of 197 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","108","197","3","0"

In Hotline Miami 2 successful strategys are often use slower pace, unlike Hotline 1 which was fast and aggressive. This game really reminds me why I enjoyed Hotline Miami through its level design. The first game made your failure yours alone and not as if the game cheated you, Wrong Number fails to do this. Deaths in Wrong Number are often a result of off screen enemys makign deaths more fustrating and degrades the experience.\n\nIt appears in Wrong Number the loss of mechanical satisifaction is due to an increased emphasis on story. In Hotline Miami one I never engaged with the story as it was such an insiginificant aspect of the game. The story was previously told in the shadows of the levels and never meant to be experienced by those who did not search for it. Wrong Number Story is unavoidable like the sun, but fails to have any impact on the player.\nThe only feature of this game that compensates for this lacklust game is its soundtrack, which like the first is entrancing and enhances the adrenaline rush.\n\nI cannot recommend this game as the emphasis on story fails does not compensate the game diversion from mechanics resulting in it not recapturing the initial Hotline Miami experience.","January 16","false","3.1"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","17","26","0","0"

Look, I love the first game, it's probably my favourite indie game of all time, but this? What the f*ck, Dennaton?\n\nThis game basically consists of open as sh*t 500 m² long buildings made of glass packed with dogs, fat dudes and gun-wielding enemies that react to you in a nanosecond and kill you off-screen. This game is f*cking hard, but not in a good way like the first game. It's hard in a frustrating, unfair and b*llsh*tty way.\n\nIn Hotline Miami 1, when you died, 90% of the time it was totally your fault. This time around though 90% of your deaths are due to the god awful level design.\n\nOn the technical side of things, this game is a ♥♥♥♥ing mess. It has tons of bugs, the enemies react more like robots than ever, and there are some "special" enemies like the dogs and the prisoners that run at a supersonic speed to try to strangle you that can just teleport through doors, and if you are near a door when one of them is chasing you have absolutely zero chances of surviving.\n\nAnd then there's hard mode, which is just pure b*llsh*t. It depends solely on luck, try the same strategy over and over until you eventually get it right. It's pretty much impossible to finish the game on hard mode without dying at least a couple hundred times.\n\nI've got to say though, the soundtrack gives me f*cking eargasms. Just listen to Divide, Roller Mobster, The Way Home, Sexualizer, Run, Le Perv, In The Face of Evil, Bloodline and pretty much everything else.\n\nSo, in conclusion, if you're a HUGE fan of the first game you might want to grab this for the story (I actually think they did a pretty good job on "expanding the lore" in this game and I really liked the story, but the ending was just awful), but if you're just looking for some reckless, fast-paced and fun gameplay you're better off playing the first game.","April 25, 2015","false","48.5"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","18","28","0","2"

I want to start with the soundtrack first, it is incredible. When it comes to the soundtrack it's a matter of opinion, but I felt it was just as good, if not better than the first. There are also many more tracks in the game, so it's nice to not hear the same song on 3-4 levels throughout the game. I can honestly say that I enjoyed every track in the game, and that none of them felt weak, even the slower ones that play during dialogue.\n\nThe game does share a lot of issues with the first game, which is dissapointing. You still get snagged on doorways and corners, sometimes you just can't pick up the right gun from a pile of weapons, and it can still be a bit difficult to tell where your crosshair is. Some issues are actually worse than the ones present in the first, the biggest example being the very large areas littered with enemies and windows. This makes it frustrating when you can't find cover, or you get shot by an enemy that wasn't on screen. These areas make it difficult to get good combos, and if you do manage to get an A+, it doesn't feel very rewarding because luck is what most likely got you that rating for some levels.\n\nThe story is probably the thing that is being complained about the most, but I have to disagree. It is confusing, and jumps back and forth from past and present, but is still very dark and interesting. Some characters have little to no development like the fans, or the fat dude which feels like a bit of a wasted opportunity. The story isn't phenomenal by any means, but it was still enjoyable, and just as mysterious as the first game. The best part is that fans will still be talking about it, and making theories for a little while.\n\nWhile the large and open areas were irritating, there are still some seriously great levels and moments in the game. It's upsetting that there is a lot less variety of masks this time around, but some of the missions, like the writter levels really stand out and are a nice change of pace. Hotline Miami 2 is still a very good game. There are some questionable decisons, and some levels can be much more frustrating than its predecessor, but you will still have a blast. Also remember, the level editor will help extend the life of the game, and it isn't out just yet.","March 14, 2015","true","20.0"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

I loved the first game to death (and will continue to do so, one of my favorite games of all time) but this game just doesn't feel right.\n\nThe Story\nThe story is pretty cool and all, tying up loose ends, and deepening the plot of various things, it's just that I feel it tied up TOO many loose ends. The thing about Hotline Miami 1 was that it's storyline was vague and if you just went through the game blindly mission-to-mission almost non existent, but if you payed attention, read diologue, and thought about it, it had a really mysterious and shady storyline, riddled with lies and inaccuracies, which was perfect. It felt smart, Hotline Miami 2 does kill a lot of fan theories, assumptions, and makes a lot of the actions the player does in the first a bit redundant, because the game is on a set story line where certain characters didn't/did die.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is mediocre. Instead of having the camera set so the player's ALWAYS in the middle of the screen the game now does this awkward effect where if you go to the edge of the level it stops focusing off your character, making precision shots harder and more irritating to get. There's also a HUGE focus on guns, now, with tons and tons of guns in the game, and only few real melee weapons. Hotline Miami 1 had a mix of these, supporting ridiculous weapons such as a pool cue, fireaxes, katanas, even boiling water! Guns were also a big focus too and were also supported. Nearly all levels support guns and guns only, with wide open spaces and windows surrounding you nearly all the time with few areas to have breaks. There's also less masks/perks/whatever for stages, which means less playstyles and more "use this mask to win (I.E. Alex & Ash). And a lot of the masks/perks for different characters are reskins, with the only character having unique masks being Jake, who has like 2 chapters of screentime.\n\nMusic\nMusic is 10/10, literally the best.\n\nI would NOT recommend getting this until the level editor comes out.

I guess they expected you to have started this game right after beating HLM1, because there's little in the way of starting you out slow - it's right directly into enormous, maze-like floors, full of dogs, people impervious to gunfire, and endless upon endless hallways of glass with gunmen behind them, ready to to do a 180 and snipe you across the map with a shotgun. And when you kill the dogs, the fatties who slap your ♥♥♥♥ if you try to melee them, the glass-hugging gunmen, along with fifteen other wandering mobsters, you get sniped by a person you didn't see off screen and have to do it all again.\n\nRemember when you could beat most levels in HLM1 in one furious instinct-filled blitz, using nothing but melee weapons and the gimmick tied to your mask? Yeah, you really can't do that much anymore. It's still possible, but the maps are too big, long sightlines cater too much to gunfights, there are multiple enemies who are literally impossible to beat without using guns (which seemed like a copout in HLM1), and the masks are much more restrictive and you can't choose from as many at a time, if you can choose at all.\n\nI can't beat this game. Call me a casual and a b4ddie, but I can't force myself through another thirty-mobster-strong floor of glass walls and fat men and getting sniped from offscreen if I'm truly not having as much fun as I did with HLM1. There's little experimentation and blitzing through levels, it's all about hesitantly entering doors, baiting enemies to chase, hitting them at the right moment in the patrol, and trying the same route over and over and over again until it works, since there's often times no other way to complete a floor except for that one.\n\nI haven't played the game since a week after its release and I have no urge to go back.

I had some complaints about enemies shooting me off screen but besides that the rest of the game is great. The game seems to focus more on precise execution of a plan over reaction. While this was present in the first game Hotline Miami 2 punishes you way harder for not having a plan, whereas sometimes in the original Hotline Miami I could just bs my way through a level on reaction and still do well.\n\nThe soundtrack is better than the first games since now each level has its own theme, most of which are good.\n\nThe story makes very little sense. The main issue being that many events lack context. The problem is that the game never gives you that context. Why am I fighting Russians in Hawaii? I still didn't know by the end of the game. This and many other plot points feel unresolved by the end and while some questions are answered in general there are too many questions left unanswered to feel satisfied. The best way to describe the story is that it feels like you’re in an alternate reality United States, but the game does not feel the need to explain the differences of the reality so you are just guessing why some things happen the way they do.\n\nHard mode is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. If you play hard mode expect: extra windows, more fat guys, more guys with guns, no middle mouse targeting, and ammo in guns being cut in half on pickup. (This means that if you are holding a gun that has 4 shots and throw it now has 2, if you throw it again it now has 1 shot, even though you only threw the weapon and never pulled the trigger once.)\n\nOverall Hotline Miami 2 is a good game but hard mode is only for the dedicated.","March 26, 2015","true","24.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","1"

Here are some things that notably stand out to me;\n\n1. The disjointed narrative really doesn't make sense in the beginning unless you pay a lot of attention to what is going on and who you are playing as. There are very, very subtle details that you should pay attention to.\n\n2. This game follows an alternate reality rather than modern day, where Russia attacks and takes control of part of Hawaii. It was something I really wasn't expecting due to the first game's focus on Jacket rather than what was going on around him.\n\n3. The controls seem a lot looser than the first, which really makes things a bit of a cluster and a half, but it is manageable. However, since HLM2 relies more on gun play than melee, why wouldn't you tighten down your aiming? I prefer free aiming than locking on.\n\n4. The level design really could use some work; levels are often too large with a lot of gun wielding baddies that would like nothing better than to end your day with a bullet. Believe me, almost clearing out an entire level only to be killed by the last enemy is an incredibly frustrating experience you will come to know time and time again. Either zoom out the camera so we can see more, or make the levels smaller.\n\n5. The music, like always, is incredible. I'd rather not compare it to the first because the two really stand up on their own.  HLM has more of a lively, ecstatic feel while HLM2 is more gloomy and hollow, tying well to the theme of both games.\n\n6. HLM is more about reactive gameplay and reacting to your surroundings while the sequel is more about planning your route through the sections and using each character's mechanic correctly. I will say Evan's mechanic of not killing enemies and unloading weapons was refreshing and cool.\n\n7. HLM2 is about two to two and a half times longer than the original, which is both good and bad. Good for more gameplay, bad because it may overstay its welcome.\n\n8. HLM2 is noticably harder than the original. The difficulty spikes rather early on, but you will eventually be able to handle what it throws at you.\n\n9. I did notice that sometimes you can get hit with a bullet and not die instantly, but there will be blood on the ground where you were shot. I don't know what determines this or what causes it, I just know its a thing.\n\nAt the end of the day, I have to give Hotline Miami 2 a 7/10 because of its story and music. The gameplay surprisingly didn't get repetitive, but having to replay floors over and over again just got incredibly frustrating. I saw a good comparison of HLM2 to Super Mario Brothers 2 Japan (SMB: The Lost Levels); take the most difficult and satisfying parts of the game out and expand upon them to where it is ball-bustingly hard, but you eventually earn the title of defeating it.\n\nAlso, it's quite dirty to exclude the soundtrack from the special edition, but that's just my opinion.","March 18, 2015","true","26.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR BOTH HOTLINE MIAMI GAMES\n\nHotline Miami 2's story is mainly about the reactions of characters to what happenned in the first game and it also gives some more backstory to the original hotline miami.\nNOTE: the stages aren't in chronological order.\n\nFirst of i'm going to talk about the characters and their stories.\n\nThe first characters you meet in the story are the Fans, a bunch of lowlifes who think that Jackets actions were good.\nThey're also the main protagonists of the story.\nCorey the girl in the zebra mask.\nShe has the ability to roll dodge, that makes her temporarily invulnerable for  gun fire.\nTony  the guy with the beaten up tiger mask.\nSame as the first Hotline Miami mask, it wil give you the power to kill enemies with 1 hit but you won\'t be able to pick up any weapons.\nThats a bad thing since Hotline Miami 2 is more focused on the use of weaponry, long hallways and big rooms...\nAlex and Ash, both wearing a swan mask.\nThe first time in Hotline Miami where you can play as 2 characters at once.\nYou can use Alex' chainsaw to kill fat enemies and you can use ash to shoot people while you're executing someone with your chainsaw.\nAnd then there's Mark the big guy with the bear mask.\nI can't say really much about him other than that he\'s big fat guy with 2 smg\'s with both 32 bullets in them.\nDennaton added something new, the ability to shoot at 2 directions at once while holding mouse 2 as mark.\nIt can be really usefull in some stages (Deathwish,Take over...).\nThey try to do the same as Jacket did in the first Hotline Miami game, killing Russian mobsters.\nThe reduced Russian Mafia activity has left them to aimlessly improvise targets, and they quickly find themselves doing favors for their friends, who often have loose gang connections.\nThey were also veterans in the war in Hawaii.\n\nThe second character we meet is the handsome and brave detective Manny Pardo.\nThe dirty cop killing gang members and getting away with it using his badge.\nHe's trying to find the Miami mutilator.\nThere's not really something special about Pardo other than the badass shotgun animation and the executions with guns.\nHe\'s also the first hotline miami character who uses firearms to execute enemies.\nHis story has a big plot twist.\n\nThe next character on the list is the redneck called Jake.\nI can't say much about Jake.\nHe joined 50 Blessings, in hope to do something for his country.\nLater he got phonecalls, telling him to do horrible stuff.\nA reward for his actions was a mask of his own.\n\nThe next character is Martin Brown.\nHe's a famous actor who wants to make a movie about Jacket.\nHe gets a dream where he gets interviewed and where he talks about his dark desires to kill children...\n1 guy with a chicken mask stands up and asks him if he likes hurting other people.\nIt's just a movie martin answered. But his movie went terribly wrong.\nO, he also executes enemies faster than any other character in the game.\n\nEvan, the friend of Pardo is making a book about the masked maniac killings.\nHis playstyle is very different than other characters, he doesn't kill anyone and instead of using guns he disarms them.\nAnyway up to the story.\nEvan attends the trial of Jacket and takes notes.\nHe then talks with his friend Pardo and asks him if he knows someone he can talk to about his book.\nPardo sends him to a Russian mobster called Petrov, evan gets 2 questions before he gets"the ♥♥♥♥ out of here."\nWhen he's halfway done he finds a note on the table from his wife.\nShe left him becaus he's more with his work than with his family.\nHe has the choise to reunite with his family or to continue his book.\n\nEvan was a reporter before he was a writer. He went to hawaii to look at the situation of the war.\nThere he makes a picture of Jacket and Beard, 2 members of the elite team.\nBeard has 2 weapons: a knife and a weapon of your choise (m4, shotgun, heavy mg, sniper and flametrower).\nHis team takes out a hotel full of Russians and they retook a powerplant of the Russians.\nAfter the events that happened on war he decided to open up a store in San Fransisco.\nHe was talking with Jacket on the phone until suddenly something happened outside the shop.\nThe Russians dropped a nuclear bomb. This attack is what finally causes America to surrender and effectively end the war.\n\nFor the first time in the history of hotline miami you play as a Russian henchman.\nThe Russian henchman wanted out becaus he was getting to soft for his job, he got the permission to go but he had to do 1 last job. He had to clear out a Gang-controlled chop shop, which has recently defected to the Colombians.\nAfter killing everyone inside he finds a bag of cash, he takes it with him.\nHe arrives at home and hides his money under his bed and went to sleep.\nHe got a dream, he was driving his ferrari until suddenly Richard appeared.\nRichard is the guy with the chicken mask, i think he's the grim reaper himself since he always appears when a character is about to die.\nThe henchman woke up and wanted to check his money, but there was no money under his bed anymore.\nHis girlfriend stole it and left a note on the table saying 'you would\'ve done the same.'\nThe henchman starts out with a silenced pistol.\n\nUp to my favorite character in Hotline Miami, Richter.\nRichter was a normal guy until he got phonecalls. They weren't treathening at first, they were just jobs like paint the logo of 50 blessings on the wall. Its really strange tho since we never see Richter signing up for 50 blessings, wich makes me think he got into it becaus of his father. We don't know anything about his father other than that he likes hunting.\nRichter stopped doing what the phonecalls were telling him to do since he thought it was just a joke.\nBut they were treathening his mother, his mother is old and can't do anything for herself.\nIn her eyes Richter is a nice child who tries to find work but get rejected every time but in reallity he's the first masked murderer and assassin for 50 blessings. He begins with a silenced smg in the first Hotline Miami but its never to be seen in the second Hotline Miami.\n\nUp to the last character.\nThe last character is the son, his name is never revealed.\nHe wants to avenge his father and win from the Colombian maffia.\nThere's not really allot i can say about him.\nHe has 4 playstyles.\nThe broken glasses that give you the ability to roll dodge and it gives you a katana when you choose this style.\nThen there's the 'dirty hands', they will give you killing punches but you won't be able to pick up guns.\nAnd then there's 'bloodline' wich gives you 2 smg's (same as Mark).\n\nLevel Design/gameplay\n\nLike i said Hotline Miami 2 is more focused on gunplay becaus of the long hallways and big floors.\nYou can't see the entire stage like in Hotline Miami 1, wich makes the game even harder than it is.\nYou get shot from everywhere, people prefer Hotline Miami over Hotline Miami 2 becaus of that, but i think Hotline Miami 2 is far more superior than Hotline Miami 1 in my opinion. Don't get me wrong Hotline Miami 1 is still a great game with good music and stages.\nThis game has good replayability, i have 100+ hours and i\'m sure i will put more time into this game.\nHotline Miami 2 has good variation but not as much as hotline miami 1 where you had like 20 masks you could choose from that suit your playstyle, in hotline miami 2 there are just 4 playstyles in not even all of the stages.\nOverall its still a really fun game i really don't understand why my friend doesn't like it.\n\nMusic\n\nI have no words to describe how good the music is for this game.\n\n\nPros/cons\n\nPros\n------------------\n+fun gameplay\n+good story\n+music\n\nCons\n-----------------\n-Big stages ( can be a pros if you like hard games )\n\n\nI rate this game a 10/10. In my opinion its a masterpiece.","June 1","true","137.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198096058387/recommended/274170/","76561198096058387","Müs","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198096058387/","66 products in account","Hotline miami 2 is the long awaited sequel to the 2012 top-down ultra violent action/puzzle game Hotline Miami, and what may just seem like a level pack at first comes with just enough variety to differentiate itself from the first game and always keep you guessing about what might happen next.\n\nIn the original, almost every level would follow the same structure, you pick your mask, you enter the level, you kill everyone, you leave. But Hotline Miami 2 contains several different level structures with each one standing out so gameplay never feels dull. Whilst you no longer have a broad selection of masks every level, you are given a small selection (around 4 usually) of different masks or weapons, unlike the original game, every mask feels truly different and makes you adapt your playstyle accordingly, your selection is rarely kept the same as well, preventing you from locking down on one strategy and forcing you to think on your toes on what is the best way to tackle a level. However that is not to say you are always even given a slection at all, on some levels, many times the game forces you to play as a character and work around their advantages and disadvantages, you could be stuck with someone who refuses to kill anyone or you could be given someone who starts with a silenced pistol, it's this kind of variety that makes Hotline Miami 2 stand out from it's predecessor.\n\nHotline Miami 2's level design encourages a much more gun focused style of play than the first game, in the original Hotline Miami enviroments were a lot smaller enabling the player to be able to get through almost the entire game using nothing but melee weapons. Whilst melee is not useless in Hotline Miami 2 it certainly feels less helpful as areas are much wider and require enemies to be taken down from a distance.Hotline miami 2 also requires much more planning to beat a level as in most stages you are not able to just run out guns blazing since the areas are so wide and glass is everywhere, you'll find yourself dead in a matter of seconds. In order to beat levels now you have to know your surroundings, you have to know where your enemies are at exactly what time this results in a very cover based stlye unlike the first game which encouraged a lot more recklessness and whereas this may turn off alot of people I enjoyed this style of play a lot although I didn't prefer it to the more reckless style of the first game. But thats not to say those levels aren't in the second game, and when they occured I enjoyed the change of pace.\n\nHotline Miami 2 included a much greater emphasis on story and decided to try and answer all the the things the first game didn't, the game takes place before after and at the same time as the first game and time periods switch so frequently that it feels like you have to be writing notes to catch the story the first time through. However when you slow down and think about it the story is quite interesting as you realise who certain characters are and how they affected the first game, but it's not the most mid blowing story ever told and you don't really have to worry about if you didn't catch it, overall I'm glad they put a greater emphasis on story however some of it feels slightly irrelevant.\n\nSomething that really made Hotline Miami stand out from the crowd was it's soundtrack, It had so many incredible songs, each on tells you exactly what the mood is, no matter what the level was it would get your blood pumping and kept you pushing on through a level. Hotline miami 2's soundtrack does all of this and more, there is just as much variety, from ambient, mellow tunes to fast paced, adrenaline fuelled rock, Hotline Miami 2 executes the mood with it's soundtrack flawlessly and is no doubt worth a purchase.\n\nThat's not to say Hotline Miami 2 doesn't have it's problems, some people may not like the new style of larger areas and more planned style of gameplay and I have heard about people getting several annoying bugs however I have only had the occasional spinning dog glitch but nothing else.\n\nOverall these are the pros and cons\n+varied gamplay\n+masks really make a difference\n+great visuals\n+stands out from the first game\n+interesting story\n+godlike soundtrack\n\n-the occasional bug (personal experience)\n-some may not like the change of pace in the gameplay\n-occasional unfair death\n\nI would give Hotline Miami 2 a 8/10 due to how it shook up the formula just a little but just enough to make it feel like a truly different game and a very enjoyable experience. Do I think it's better than the original? Probably not but a game would have to borderline perfect to do that and I think Hotline Miami 2 is a more than worthy sequel.","March 19, 2015","true","19.6"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","16","25","2","1"

It not only expands on everything the first game brought to the table, but adds unique gameplay features and unbridled difficulty. In comparison to the first game, the gameplay is much more varied. Instead of masks simply giving you a weapon to start with or changing your character's speed they'll completely change the way you play. From the chainsaw and gun wielding duo, Alex & Ash to using a long range sniper and close quarters knife combo this game really explores the possibilities of a top-down shooter. You'll hear some complaints about difficulty but as someone who loved the first game, it's pretty welcomed. The original Hotline Miami was one of my go-to favourite games. I'd just sit down and kill some mobsters for 15 or 20 minutes, Over the course of a few years I put quite a bit of time into the original Hotline Miami and it became pretty easy. Wrong Number realized this and knew that there had to be a steeper difficulty curve. It starts to bar on the difficulty of old NES and SNES games which may seem unfair to some people but was more of reminiscent or nostalgic feeling for me. The game never feels impossible but rather incredibly challenging.\n\nThe music is just as good (if not better than the first game) and alone is worth the purchase. You'll find the soundtrack pumping you up to clear the next room or just chill you out while you're selecting a chapter to replay. I purchased the vinyl soundtrack and it was worth every penny.\n\nAs for the story; Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number keeps the retro 1980s (and early 1990s) vibe the first game established and drives it home with a mosaic of eighties and nineties movie tropes. In true Hotline Miami tradition they paint the whole picture through disjointed and hazy visuals in cut-scenes as well as subtle background imagery allowing for you to still come up with wild theories and discuss the story with your friends. The games art is unmistakeably beautiful and tranquil at times while being disturbing, gory & over-the-top violent the rest of time. Dennaton has said this will be their last Hotline Miami instalment and they manage to send the series off in a melancholy, dark and beautiful tone.\n\nTo sum everything up, Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number will probably not appeal to those who are faint of heart or are seeking a more relaxing experience. But will be very satisfying for those who a looking for a insanely challenging retro game. Especially to who enjoy the 80s/90s neon blood-spattered world. Hotline Miami 2 will go down as one of my absolute favourite games of all time.","March 12, 2015","true","109.0"," 26 of 44 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","26","44","0","0"

The open corridors and heavy window use is simply a different way about designing the game and requires a different way of thinking. Veterans coming from the first game didn't expect to have the learning curve that they did with this game because the same methods used in Hotline 1 will get you nowhere except for a corner shooter. You can play this game without baiting and corner-shooting but you have to learn to. Dennation made a very nice decision to make an even more punishing game play, even for veterans.\n\nPros:\n\n+ The soundtrack is amazing, seriously amazing. Very well put together songs by the talented artists of the first game as well as many other new additions from different equally as talented artists.\n+ People will disagree with me, but the story. The jumping around is hard to follow, but the actual story has so many neat little secrets and reveals so much about the first game, as to why Jacket even started killing and what happened as a result. I will be completely honest, I DID NOT expect the ending but I actually enjoyed it.\n+ Rather than giving you a bunch of masks at the beginning, a lot of which have no use (I'm looking at you, Rick :'( ), the game switches you between a couple play styles that it forces you to use. The choices you do get, when you get them, are all viable.\n+ Same art style and rules as the first game, so they were able to introduce many new concepts but still were able to keep the same base game\n+ Still as difficult and wonderfully frustrating as the first\n\nCons:\n\n- A bit buggy, enemies can get stuck in doors or shoot into invisible walls\n- Missing some fun features, like taking human shields (I never used that anyway) and stealth executing standing enemies.\n- Ground executions take twice as long, which can be very annoying.\n\n\nI mean, if you enjoyed the first, you'll enjoy this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AtomicAstro/recommended/274170/","AtomicAstro","Astro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AtomicAstro/","55 products in account","Now, don't let the thumbs up in the review fool you, it's just from my personal experience with the game. If you really want to know whether I recommend this or not to you, please read on. Now, the gameplay is very similar to the first game, why fix what isn't broken? There's not much in regards to new mechanics from the gameplay in and of itself, new mechanics are provided through the different masks. (or whatever the hell it is you choose in the beginning of the stage, depends on which one, more detail in regards to that later) In the first game, the masks served as merely ingame bonues, not really adding any additional mechanics, just advantages, like dogs not attacking you, doors being lethal, etc. There are still masks that do that, but there are now more masks that actually provide you advantages through new mechanics, for example, the default mask "Corey" provides you with a roll dodge, "Mark" provides you with two machine guns, to have an interesting dual weilding mechanic (and for some reason you can't dual weild after the guns run out of ammo, which is kinda disappointing). Overall I really like this, as it makes the mask you choose make more of a difference. Now, unlike the previous game that just focuses on one character, this game focuses on multiple. You alternate between several different time periods/stories with each character. This is actually really cool, as it adds a bit more variety to the game. But unfortunately, this comes with a downside. Although I complimented the masks making a difference, because of the constantly alternating charcters, they have different masks. And it's not always even masks you're picking, in the section where you play as a guy fighting in the Cold War, you unlock guns. Whatever the case, you unlock everything for every character throughout the first playthrough of the game! You don't even really have to try very hard to unlock the masks! In the first game, it meant a lot to unlock new masks because it's one character that you're constantly developing, but unlocking stuff just doesn't mean much when you probably won't use it until next time you play in that character's story, and even then there isn't that much to unlock. So unlockables have gone through a major downgrade this time around. Another complaint I have about this game is that the level design, although it's not horrible, isn't as good as the original game. The level design is good enough to keep the game fun, but GOD DAMN ARE THERE A TON OF OFFSCREEN DEATHS! The levels are ♥♥♥♥ing gigantic, and the enemies are spaced so far apart that it's dangerous to ever let go of the left shift key. Now, this doesn't really get too bad until the later stages in the game, but it's still a problem. Overall the enemy placement can feel really cheap and annoying to deal with. But it's usually not too bad, so I can't hate on this aspect of the game too much. I still had a lot of fun playing through it. In terms of difficulty, the first game was ♥♥♥♥ing hard. This game really expects you to have played the first, because it is definitely harder. So if you want this game, play the first one if you haven't already. I praised the soundtrack in the last game, and in this game, they really knocked it out of the park! The soundtrack here is absolutely outstanding, even better than the first game! If there is one thing I absolutely have to say I prefer over the first game, it's the soundtrack. Now, this game may not be for some, because although it's a good game, it's not that great a sequel. It really doesn't do much to top the first game, so if you're looking for that in this, you'll find yourself disappointed. However, if you don't really need it to be much better than the first game and are willing to go for an experience that is good despite its flaws, then I recommend it.","February 11","true","13.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The main draw of Hotline Miami is the fast split second combat where you act faster than you can even register, and if you fail you just try again. In this game however, that's not so true. Why is that? Simple, there's a LOT of enemies with guns in this one, and there's also a lot of windows and wide open rooms. This means that you either need to use a gun yourself, or you can do the old last resort of sticking your head out the doorway until they notice you, duck back, and wait for them to come to you. This was present in the first game but was only very rarely needed and was only there as a last possible resort, in this game it's basically meta.\nThere are some other points one could bring up, the masks feel a lot more varied with more unique bonuses, but some of these feel like double edged swords, and aren't very consistantly usable, an example being a mask that let's you kill with punches but are unable to pick up any weapons at all, something very bad when ranged attacks are so valueable, also a mask you can use in some levels can't be used in others.\nThe story feels all over the place skipping ahead and rewinding to different characters, it's not the kind of story you can understand in one go, at least not without writing down when everything is happening and creating some sort of timeline. And finally one of the most important parts of making a game where you die a lot is letting you get back up and start immediately again, this was usually the case in the first one, but here a little too often you're going to find yourself sitting on your hands as you wait for an enemy with a gun to walk out of sight before going through a door, or somehting of that nature.\n\nSo to close things off, if you played the first one, and are interested in getting the second, I'd only suggest it if you think you can handle all of this. If you're thinking of getting into the series, start with the first one.","October 31, 2015","false","4.0"," 48 of 88 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","48","88","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KHFan20/recommended/274170/","KHFan20","KHFan20","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KHFan20/","205 products in account","I am torn apart by this game (like most of the enemies you will meet). For everything good that it does, there is almost always something annoying happening to counteract it, whether it be glitches or game mechanics. Towards the end of the game, I questioned whether I was actually playing it because I liked it, or just playing it to see it to the end.\n\nThe gameplay. You will be killed by an offscreen enemy many times, and while you can do the same to them, I would rather be able to see where I am shooting instead of firing blind. The huge turning point between this game and the first is that the levels are larger, meaning the gameplay has turned into a "lure and kill" strategy game. You will not be able to run into a room and spray gunfire everywhere (in most of the levels). Something else that really irked me is that you can't effectively pick up a weapon that you want. This seems like a minor detail at first, but when you have certain types of enemies that can't be shot or bludgeoned rushing at you, it's a different story. Enemies will get caught in doorways and twitch non-stop, as if they are telling you to hold the door for them next time. They will also randomly spin in place, and I'm not sure whether this is intentional or not because it happens to the same enemies everytime. I also feel like there wasn't as much thought put into the enemy placement; it feels like they went the Dark Souls II route and just put enemies everywhere in order to make the game feel harder than it really should be. Whenever I saw I unlocked hard mode after beating the game I just laughed and thought: "...Well I'm never playing that."\n\nThe music. What can I say? It was universally accepted that the soundtrack to this game would be excellent... and it is! However, sometimes the music can get obnoxiously loud. I'm talking take-your-headphones-off-loud. The first time this happened was so unexpected I nearly jumped out of my seat. This seems like it should be a good thing, and to be honest you can really get into the music at first, but then you die 50 times and hear it loop 37 times. This is especially noticeable in the final stage of an act. It's as if it's trying to tell you, "AM I GOOD? YOU KNOW I AM." You're probably wondering why I didn't just turn it down. I could have, but the fact of the matter is that I shouldn't have to.\n\nThe plot. Hotline Miami 1's story intrigued me, and the mystery surrounding Jacket and the phone calls are what pulled me in. I am pleased to say the plot in Hotline Miami 2 is fleshed out more than the first. There is a lot more dialogue this time around, adding personalities to the many characters in the story. The story is very hard to understand your first time, unless you're really good at paying attention to minute details and keeping track of dates. Think about it like if the movies "Memento" and "Pulp Fiction," had a baby and it was addicted to cocaine.\n\nOverall, I feel like the story and music alone are not enough to make you want to play the game; and you realize just how repetitive the game is because it feels like it drags out near the end. So did I have a positive or negative experience with Hotline Miami 2? To be perfectly honest, I really don't know. When the music and plot are the more enjoyable elements of your game, maybe you should just make a visual novel instead.\n\nHotline Miami 3! ~Jacket's Trip to Japan Miami~","March 14, 2015","false","7.5"," 50 of 92 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","50","92","3","0"

First of all, I'm not a big fan of the level design. Many levels are much more open that I'm used to. This change made me drop my style from the first game and be really careful. Sometimes (when I picked Tony, who can't use any weapons now) I had to bait enemies one after the other so I won't get shot. On this kind of levels I don't feel like I did throughout Hotline Miami 1. It was hard, but if you gave it enough time, you were starting to feel confident and could rush through levels min-maxing your completion time (around 40 minutes for me). I don't think this is going to work here. Much more gunplay is required; the balance betwen melee and guns is about 30-70 for me.\nOn the other hand, visual aesthetic and soundtrack is still rocking, with a great surreal sequence near the end. Oh, in this one there's much more dialogue and story. There are multiple playable characters, some of whom had restrictions or bonuses. It's much more vital than masks in the first game. For example, one character doesn't use guns at all, and another can only equip ammo to his one weapon of choice. This is another reason why I didn't feel too confident - the story jumps around and sometimes I had a hard time adapting to new rules. I think the main reason I would come back to HM2 is the level editor coming up this spring.\n\nOverall, if you enjoyed the first game, I think you should at least give it a try - maybe you'll love it, maybe you'll think it's okay. It misses the strong, fast style of Hotline Miami 1, but this game can still be a lot of fun. So, like, that's good.

The game has many cons, which are only cons when the player compares them to the original while the game is perfect when not comparing, similar to the feeling transitioning between Sanctum 1 and Sanctum 2. The soundtrack is phenomenal and the artstyle solid, the game easily becomes incredibly frustrating due to what should actually be praised.\n-much longer levels\n-massively increased floors\n-greatly varying gameplay\nOn one's first playthrough, these quickly become cons:\n-angry at a level's design? It'll only be another 20 minutes\n-huge floor and being killed by one of the last enemies on the floor and starting over\n-not being used to a mask's major ability combined with its drawbacks will become incredibly frustrating and difficult until the player learns how to properly utilize the character.\nThere are many changes meant to make the game appear much more fluid and smoother such as more animations, and more enemies that are different and deviate from HM1's standard thug and larger thugs make it much more interesting. A major change is that with the game having characters that are not Jacket mean that a level is designed for that character and their ability, and will take time to become accustomed to but becomes incredibly rewarding.\n\nThe story is incredible and will take place from the 70s-90s jumping between character to character and elaborates on HM1, but Jacket is not the main focus in the game. The gameplay and soundtrack, combined with dialogue will make the player justify our love for violence in video games and pop culture, but at the same time ask, "Do we need to justify it?" It has characters that have personality if you look out for it, but can be missed by the rapid alternating.\n\nCons in the game at the moment are\n-levels later become too open and easy to be shot at from all angles, or too small but packed with enemies\n-some gameplay elements do not make sense, such as the Hawaii levels having ammo crates scattered around that allow the player to restock their ammo only when fully empty, meaning you'll have to fire that last bullet to get 10 more for no apparent reason\n-the Alex and Ash pair (one has a gun that follows you and you play as the one with a chainsaw but also control the gun)'s gun-wielding AI's pathing is a mess, frequently walks into walls or falls behind and suddenly rushes through a wall to join you\nOther than the mentioned cons, the game is phenomenal and when the player gets angry, take a break and come back to it. Easily can get overly frustrating and seem like a bad game, but on the second playthrough one will find details they missed and will be prepared for levels and can handle them much better and will enjoy it more. Both is and isn't what one completely expected, Hotline Miami 2 definitely has surpassed my expectations and brings closure and joy at what is left for me to play again and again.","March 11, 2015","true","82.2"," 27 of 48 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","27","48","0","0"

Despite carrying all of the flaws of the original, it doesn't add much to make up for it.  Whatever was improved in game length, Hotline Miami 2 lacks in polish.  Levels are still fun, but expect to find levels a bit more like the bonus levels in HM1 or the Assault level instead of more thought out levels like miami disco.  The gameplay is significantly more limited, and has shifted from melee to guns.  Your mask selection is more limited as well, and during the times in which you're forced to play as one character in the vigilante missions, it can feel really cheap when you're burdened by that mask's flaws.  Overall, the gameplay is still good, but not great, and reminds me strongly of the second half of Hotline Miami 1 when you play as Jacket.  I would still reccomend it, giving it a 7/10.\n\nSome bugs I noticed:\n\nSpinning dogs\nFloaty-feeling mouse, which I'm sure will be fixed in a patch.\nUnlike the first game, bullet tracers come from the player, and not their gun.","March 10, 2015","true","9.0"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","17","29","0","1"

A Hotline Miami 2 review that isn't some bad joke? It can't be! Anyway, moving on.\n\nPros:\nGreat soundtrack, imo it manages to surpass the first game's soundtrack, which was amazing.\nNice visuals\nExplains the events of the first game\nDoesn't overstay it's welcome\nInteresting characters, either by gameplay or story\nUpcoming level editor for endless replayability\nHas even more violence than the first game\nHas a lot of replay value\nHas more levels than the first game\nHas hard mode which stays true to its name. Hard mode changes several game mechanics such as levels being flipped (possibly the biggest change along with tougher enemies spawning and ammo from dropped weapons being halved) and not being to lock on enemies\nFair combo time window\nThe game has a lot of subtle details, try to pay attention\n\nCons\nLevel design, you probably were expecting this, but they dropped the ball quite a few times on the level design. The main problem with levels is that they are just waaay too long, which a lot of time results in you getting killed by off screen enemies.\nDoors feel like they are there to simply screw your combo up, in the first game they at least had some use if you were using the Don Juan mask, in this game they don't work as well, mainly because if you knock an enemy down you are probably gonna lose your combo since melee executions are now considerably slower compared to the first game\nThe AI is incredibly inconsistent, this is an old problem as the first's AI was also inconsistent, sometimes when you turn a corner enemies will instantly shoot at you while sometimes they don't even react, the dog AI suffers a lot from this, dogs will frequently ignore your presence then suddenly leap at you\nEven though they appear in only one level I feel like its worth mentioning the ''fast'' prisoner enemy type that appears in ''Release'' doesn't work very well, a lot of times it feels like they simply clip through the wall/door and somehow manage to kill you, you need absolutely perfect timing to kill them seeing as them can only be killed with melee weapons. Plus it feels like the game gives a certain priority to the prisoner, it always feels like you attack first but the game decides to first register the prisoner's attack.\nI am not 100% sure on this, but it feels like you can't look as further as in Hotline Miami 1, which is a horrible combination with the level design\nThe game has a lot windows, even more so than the first game, like doors, they feel like they are there to just screw you over. At least you can shoot enemies through windows or bait them, unlike doors which really aren't good for anything most of the time. Still, the number of windows the game has is frustrating.\nThe game has some minor bugs, such as enemies getting stuck in doorways and dogs completely ignoring the player, it's also possible for the player character to get stuck in walls, I believe this can happen during the transition of screens in the level.\nEnemy placement can be inconvenient, one example of this is in the first screen of ''Demolition'', where the unarmed player character has to face off against a thug (FYI this type of enemy can only be killed with a firearm), two mobsters wielding melee weapons and an actual armed mobster.\nYou can't be as reckless as in the first game, mainly due to the fact that most enemies use firearms amd that the levels are very open and long. Plus windows don't help.\n\nNeutral\nThe ending, I am not going to be spoiling it but I'm just going to say that it was unexpected. Either it was a good or bad ending is subjective.\nThe mask catalog from the first game is for the most part gone, you can only use the masks as The Fans (and there are only five masks). On the bright side you have 14 playable characters, some which play similar to others, but most of them are different from each other.\n\nHotline Miami 2 has its share of problems, but overall I think it is a great game. Maybe not as good as the first one for some people, plus you might hate the ending. But still, if you were a fan of the first game, at least consider getting this.\n\nNotes:\nYou get some masks for Payday 2 if you buy the game. Plus you also get to play as Jacket if you buy the deluxe edition.\nThere is probably something I forgot to mention here.","August 27, 2015","true","87.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","2"

Compared to the first game, the level design is horrendous. You seem to have very few options a lot of times, and playing the whole game melee-only doesn't seem possible. Running into an area, guns-blazing, isn't a good way to beat the levels.\nMany of the rooms are huge, and you can't even see from one side to the other with aiming. This is a real problem since it really hurts your ability to track enemies in the area. Ontop of this, many levels seem to just have an absurd number of interior windows... so if you walk into an open area, you are within line-of-sight of multiple different areas, all filled with rifle-toting enemies. You're going to get shot and have to restart a LOT. Because of this, the best way to clear levels is to play them out very slowly, not wasting a shot. This is the complete opposite of the first game.\n\nThe game is fairly buggy at times as well, compared to the first. Doors in particular are damn near broken. Enemies get stuck in doors frequently, seem to stop in doorways, lose sight of you in door ways, etc. In some of the more ridiculous levels I pretty much just abused doorways and made the enemies funnel into them just to thin them out to make the levels actually enjoyable. The AI is insanely bad as well, perhaps it's just a line-of-sight issue, I'm not sure. You can often kill a guy next to a stationary enemy, and that enemy won't even react. AI just seem to patrol paths more than anything, but on some levels killing a guy with melee causes enemies from all the adjacent rooms to swarm you. Pretty inconsistent behavior.\n\nThe game still does a lot well... The music is still great, the graphics are unique and interesting, there's some interesting design behind the pause menu, things like that. The story seems less interesting, but probably ends up about the same.\n\nThe game itself just seems much harder in general, and a lot of your deaths feel like it's due to a lack of information / clarity for you to react to, instead of you just screwing up.  An example being a black dog patroling across a black floor. You will pretty much never notice him until he kills you the first time. Also, there are a ton of random objects on the ground that prevent you from going around. I found myself getting snagged on them often while trying to dodge and run around. Some of them seem like there would be enough room to walk by them, but there's not. More frustrations.\n\nI can't really recommend this sequel unless you're a huge fan of the first game, have played it multiple times, love to memorize levels or enjoy relying on your reflexes to carry you through levels.","March 26, 2015","false","6.9"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","20","35","0","0"

They experiment with game mechanics that restrict the players options. It can be frustrating because some of the worst gimmicks, especially in the soldier's levels, feel unreasonably divorced from the game's memorable flexibility.\nLevel design is far more open, leading to annoying instances where enemies from off screen, even beyond the range of extended view, will open fire on you. The soft touch on randomizing weapons enemies hold, and their patrol path inconsistency, adds to pain.\nIMO, finding the "flow", the "solutions", in the levels is far more difficult as a whole.\n\nStill, it is Hotline and more. I did enjoy some of the limiting mechanics, especially with the non-lethal Writer. It feels really cool to disassemble guns on the fly and knock thugs out. The story is as 'd'ucked as it ever was, perhaps even more. I feel that it's more coherent this time around, and answers more questions a bit more clearly. It's still a drug-addled mess though.\nIt goes without saying, paradoxically, that the music 'd'ucking rules.\nLook up the music credits and pay the artists' various webpages a visit.","March 11, 2015","true","20.9"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","21","37","0","0"

Hotline Miami 2 is exactly that.  More Hotline Miami. Fast and frantic gameplay that demands quick reflexes and patience, an unmistakable visual style that's as gory as it is colorful, and a soundtrack that bumps even harder than the original. At its core, with Hotline Miami 2, you really couldn't ask for more.\n\nIf you're looking for anything else or a game that expands on the mechanics and ideas of the original game, or found yourself completely fulfilled with the what the first Hotline Miami offered, then maybe give Hotline Miami 2 a pass.\n\nFor the most part, there's a lot of fun to be had here, however there are quite a few moments where the formula kinda breaks. This has a lot to do with the level design and stages being MUCH more open and featuring less cover for you to hide behind to formulate your approach to a situation. Though many guards have static positions or pre-defined patrol routes, there are quite a few more enemies this time around that randomly mill about, and in these larger areas it makes them much harder to keep track of. There can be many moments (particularly during missions set in Hawaii) where even when you're using SHIFT to look around, that you'll end up sniped by someone who you couldn't see off screen.  It's entirely deflating at best, and rage-inducing at worst, and it can happen too often for it to be hand waved away as a "non-issue."  On the whole, the level designs just feel less honed and thought out than the original game.\n\nI will however, commend the confidence with which Hotline Miami 2's narrative plays out. It's a much more narrative-focused affair than the original, and though the issues the game addresses are largely more important to itself and its world rather than trying to make any kind of statement, the gusto with which the story elements present themselves and play out is admirable, and I can enjoy it for the big, dumb thing that it is. The "movie" scenes/mission however feel entirely pointless and have no bearing on the actual meat of the story, and feel tacked on and thrown in to incite shock value. Really could have done without those.\n\nIn the end, this game isn't going to convince anyone that wasn't convinced with the first game. Like I said, if you want more of what Hotline Miami offered, go in knowing that this game in no way can have the same kind of impact the original had, and be mindful of the level design flaws.","March 28, 2015","true","22.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","2"

It was worth the wait.\n\nSo let's start with the gameplay.. Pretty much identical to Hotline Miami, bar some new moves provided by masks such as duel wielding, dodge rolls, 'unleash inner warrior', and so on. These are really fun to use.\nDifficulty wise, I felt that Hotline Miami 2 was a lot more difficult on particular levels, which is good, and they've even got a hard mode which you unlock after completing the game.. I'm yet to try this however.\n\nMusic. Possibly the greatest strength of this title is it's music. There's nothing like sending souls into the void to the sound of some upbeat yet dark music. Compared to Hotline Miami, I feel the music for this had a much darker tone to it, possibly due to the fact that the events taking place in HM2 are a bit more tense.\nWhen you're playing the game, you don't even feel like you're killing these people, it's only until when you complete a mission and the music stops that you notice, after trudging through pieces of your 'enemy'. That's the power of the music they use. (Or I'm just too damn immersed.)\n\nHold on.. The phones ringing.\n\nRight, so, story.. Now that's a difficult one. I'm not even too sure I know what happened, and of course I couldn't say anyway, loads of spoilers. I quite enjoyed it, you play from the view of many people.. Not all of them are murdering psycho's either. And they all have their own style of killing, sort of.\n\nI'm not sure what to make of the ending either, I feel a bit empty.. It was awfully grim. No holding back by Dennaton Games.\n\nNow I'm off, business calls.\n\n\n\ntl;dr/overview.\nAmazing game, a few new features and pretty sweet level designs.

You'll loose interest in the initial plot after\na couple of missions, leaving you with characters you don't care about.\n\nThey did their best to offer something new gameplay-wise, but end up\nimposing restrictions on your play style. I.e. a character, who can't pick up anything,\nand has to reload his gun from ammo crates, which are scarcely placed around the giant,\nopen levels.\nYou will run out of your ammo 20 sec. in and switch to sneak mode. But sneaking doesn't\nwork well in these open areas, which makes these levels not intense, but very boring and frustrating.\nHotline Miami gave you hard levels, but also all the tools you need to overcome them.\nHotline Miami 2 gives you boring levels, and takes your tools away.\nLuckily, this applies only to a couple of giant and slow paced levels.\n\nThe game features 11 playable characters, out of which only 3 are an improvement\non the original formula. The other characters have either the same capabilities than the protagonist from the 1st game, or have less.\n\nA quick overview:\n\nThe Soldier:         can't pick up weapons, can pick up ammo from crates\nThe Writer:          can't shoot guns. only blunt weapons\nThe Henchman:  no masks. Just a dude.\nThe Boss:            has the ablilities of all the fans except Ash & Alex\nJake:                    he has 3 masks to choose from\nThe Detective:    no masks. Just a dude.\nThe Pig Butcher: just a dude.\nThe Fans:            they have a veriaty of different abilities, depending on which one you choose to do the mission with.\nMy favourites are Alex & Ash, who are two characters you control at the same time, one wielding a\nchainsaw for close combat, and the other wielding irearms.\n\nFor me, only the Fans were fun to play, because they had abilities which made the game more enjoyable.\nThey were like extended masks from the original game, going even further with the unique abilities. I also\nfeel they had more potential developing an interesting story with. I'd rather have a game half as long just with these dudes. Unfortunately, they all die half-way through the game, leaving you with these other interesting gameplay restrictions.\n\nBigger isn't better.\nBigger levels, not fun.\nBigger story, boring\nBigger pool of characters, unnecessarily frustrating.\n\nIf you disliked this game, there is a good chance you might like the original game, which is shorter, but knows what it wants and what it's good at.","March 11, 2015","false","6.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

A lot of changes in design are mostly what came out during my repeated playthroughs. It's less about having a sandbox to tear through, and more about solving floors that are more like puzzles now. Many levels boil down to firing a gun to lure enemies, and killing them safely. Risky behavior isn't rewarded like it used to be, as just about every single level has gun-weilding enemies, usually in excess.\n\nThe characters are more interesting this time around, and there's some fun mechanics that were added. The Swan Siblings are the coolest, but they are extremely buggy in pathing. Dual MP5s are also fun to use. However, this game has less melee weapons than the first game; some weapons were even removed, such as sledge hammer, dart, scissors, etc. Tons of guns got added, though.\n\nI feel like this game will be more worth it when the level editor comes out, and the design issue can be fixed with crowd-sourcing some campaigns out. The story itself is interesting (I like it, anyway), and the music is amazing, but the gameplay is somewhat flawed compared to the original. Many bugs persist from the first game, like glitchy dogs and pathing through doors getting wonky. No crashes, though.\n\nStill: it's not a bad game. It's just not really an improvement or expansion for how long it took to develop. If you really want more of Hotline Miami, this isn't a bad investment. If you haven't played Hotline Miami, play that one first, if only to better understand the story.","March 13, 2015","true","30.2"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Wrong Number replaces that with an overly convoluted story featuring a diverse cast of characters, almost all of whom you will play as during the course of the game. These characters are all put in difficult situations. Sometmes these situations are organic to the story, othertimes they are not. Charging through a building as a masket bandit picking off mobsters and villains feels right. A timid writer who has to fend off violent subway thugs while on the way to an interview feels tacked-on to add a few more minutes of gameplay.\n\nGameplay itself feels largely the same, which is a definite plus. However, there is one key difference...one I really can't forgive.\nThe first game was challenging, but understandably so. Every stage, while difficult, could be overcome with strategy and wit. The gameplay in Wrong Number is simply hard for the sake of being hard, and is neither satisfying nor fun.  Instead, it is frustrating and enraging.\n\nThe only way I can recommend this game is if you're a fan of being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off all the time.","February 18","false","4.8"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","1"

Best sound track, Iconic characters. Amazing rewarding gameplay and great story. Probably one of my most favourite titles ever.\n\nHyped all the way up to release, even preordered the special edition then boom, day before release and I start to see Hotline Miami 2 reviews the day before it's about to come out and they are giving it mediocre reviews and saying it's a disappointment. Some other reviews pop up and they don't say anything that sounds much better. My stomach turns and I think WTF, I know reviewers can sometime's be harsh, and they can be wrong. Either way, I was going to play it and finish it.\n\nSo I finished it tonight and I have to say this. I don't know if the people who reviewed the game where tripping but what the actual ♥♥♥♥. Hotline Miami 2 succeeds it's predecessor in nearly every way. I can't actually think in any way it didn't come to think of it. I loved it, all the way through, it was harder, faster, better, stronger! :D Seriously, even though I don't trust reviewers much, I still take consideration into what they say, but now I do even less so.\n\nGuys seriously I loved hotline miami 1 so much and 2 was amazing. It's better, the way sequals shoudl be. I just wish I could play more. I don't really agree with sequals unless was intentional, like your story was too long or you in your hearts of hearts felt that it was right. I am gutted they said they won't do another, but I also understand. I just wish it wasn't so definitive. I really will be picking up their next game, whatever it is as long as it interest me, which I am sure it will, I am quite open minded.\n\nSome of them songs and moment of story and gameplay man.... pick it up, do two better and pick up the soundtrack and the special edition. Take your time and enjoy it, or just keep playing if you can't stop.

Things get a lot more frustrating, but I simply could not stop myself from driving to the conclusion even if it wasn't exactly something I wanted to see.\n\nThe game is a sensual feast that leaves me exhausted after a while, even more so than the first game, with a soundtrack that's even more driving and mesmerizing. The new characters add a lot of variety, but there are some serious balance issues going on and it detracts somewhat from the simplicity that made the first one so smooth. From tight, confined experience to broader and messier, there are still a lot of things here I enjoyed, but it's simply not as memorable as the first game and remains one for the fans who want a little more.

Its almost as though no-to-limited playtesting went into designing the game. Some playstyles will have a huge disadvantage compared to others, particularly those that tend to go loud. This coincides with another grievance of mine: in Hotline Miami, it was fairly well regarded that "Recklessness is rewarded" (hence why there is a tip on the loading screen saying exactly that). In Hotline Miami 2, however, Patience is the name of the game, which seems ironic for a title claiming to offer fast-paced killing-spree combat. Those who played the first game all the way through may remember the level Hot & Heavy. Huge, long, tons of windows, massive focus on guns. It wasn't a fantastic level, arguably the most annoying in the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kristianswaglad/recommended/274170/","kristianswaglad","Kristian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kristianswaglad/","92 products in account","Hotline Miami 2 is probably one of my favourite games on Steam. If you're thinking about picking it up, I'd recommend playing the first game before this.\n\nThe game plays the same as the first one, however to me has a slower pace which can make it easier. The story is told in a confusing manner by fastforwarding and rewinding throughout the game, looking at events prior and after the events of the first game. The story itself does not focus on Jacket himself, focusing on other characters such as the Russian mob boss, and the 'Fans' that idolise Jackets murder sprees. While the story may struggle to make sense at first, it makes sense when viewed chronologically and helps the player understand the story of the first game.\n\n'Hard Mode' can also provide a good challenge once the game has been completed, with features such as a reversed map, less ammo in weapons, less damage resistance, extra windows and extra enemies.\n\nThe long-awaited level editor has recently been added, finally entering beta mode. This means crashes and bugs can occur, but this can be expected. Viewing user created levels is currently a little tricky as workshop has still not been implemented.\n\nOverall the game is good, there isn't much to complain about apart from the slower paced, larger maps which can prove frustrating when dying deep into the level, however this can be expected from the Hotline Miami franchises gameplay. Would recommend both games.","January 28","true","40.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

The first was beyond belief. Both depict ultraviolent, grimy worlds. Both feature this silent anti-hero protagonist. Both had this visceral melee combat with later levels that delved into gunplay, smoothly and efficiently creating mass chaos in the final levels.\n\nIn the sequels, they seem to experiment too much. There are too many guns too early. There is too much enemy corner cheesing for an easy quick kill. Everything feels less rewarding and more frustrating. Both seemingly have weird censorship issues dodged by the first.\n\nBoth let you play your way the first time around and restrict freedom in the sequel. This soils the experience by the midpoint.\n\nThere isn't freeflow movement. There are things everywhere that you can get caught on. Some things can be shot over, some things can't.\n\nCertain masks completely restrict weapon choices. Some characters are non-lethal. Some characters can't pick up any weapons and can only use fists. These are great and interesting design experiements, as masks, these could be really cool mechanics. However, these are forced choices in certain levels (level 12 is awful). Using fists is fine, except when a ton of enemies have guns and are at the far ends of rooms and must be aggroed by door-cheesing.\n\nThe ducklings are awesome and really fun to play, except when the shooter gets caught on every other piece of furniture and you're back to soloing with a single melee weapon anyway.\n\nBut what I really loved about the first game was the speed and free-flow movement. Hit the enemy with the door, grab the bat, smash his head in and his three cronies, throw the bat at the guy with the shotgun, steal the gun blast away the dogs chasing you.\n\nIn the sequel, you are forced to play slower because there are too many guns, too much glass, and too few weapon options (depending on your char). And that doesn't even discuss the fact that peeking is now impossible to play without. Some people may master peeking and walking, but I find myself stopping to peek and search for another annoying ♥♥♥ gunner in the top left room who is going to one-shot me through some glass that's off-screen somewhere.\n\nThe soundtrack is just as amazing as the first and is definately a highlight and reason to check out HM2.\n\nBack to Manhunt 2 though, the biggest similiarity between these series is that the first one is simply a better title. It's awesome to see the series get expanded on, but the sequel experiements too much and fixes what isn't broken.\n\nSo, if you're a die-hard fan, check it out, maybe you'll dig the super-restrictive levels. They are definately a huge pain in the ♥♥♥ difficulty wise.\n\nIf you've never played the first, get that instead. You'll enjoy it way more.\n\nTL;DR play the first one and if you can't get enough try this one out","March 10, 2015","false","7.7"," 57 of 108 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","57","108","0","0"

Larger levels require more practice to get all the way through and it replaces the first games wide selection of masks with a small selection of options for each character/level, but I think it makes up for these. Once you get a room down, it's a very intense experience, and certain character styles (such as Evan Wright's ability to switch between non-lethal and full-blown PTSD rampage, or Jake's fast-paced timed nunchuck sessions) are more interesting than some of the HM1 masks.\n\nA major difference between this and the first game (which I absolutely also recommend, and you should play before playing this one) is that the first has a minimalist story which is intriguing but exists only enough to provide a context for violence-fueled missions. This game builds up the story much more, moving to times both before and after the events of HM1. Some people dislike this change, but the story is great, and the ending is incredible.\n\nAlso, as a pro tip: A lot of people complain about getting killed by enemies you can't see in this one (because of windows). You need to use shift (or, on a controller, I think L?) to look around. No one can see you outside of your vision range.","June 29, 2015","true","40.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Well, other than being Hotline Miami, the game offers a lot more weapons and a few new enemies, allowing new ways to kill.

You can play as Tony (The Tiger), Mark (The Bear), Ash & Alex (The Swans), and Corey (The Zebra). Although... You don't get much choice, there are lots of levels where you don't play as the fans, rather than three others(Explained below) who are still fun to play, but don't offer the mask bonuses.\n\n\n\nMinor spoilers ahead.\nThe "Fans" Are a whole bunch fun to play as, however,  You honestly don't get to play as them that much, there are many parts where you get to play as a different character, but the fans that I've looked forward to playing as weren't in the game that much.\n\nYou can also play as a book writer, who doesn't kill, and disables firearms upon pickup, offering a hard challenge for players who rely on guns, and a detective, who isn't much different from the main game, using guns and blah blah blah.\nAnd also,  The son of the main bad dude form the last game, I don't know names.(Has a few bonuses, but not as fun as the fans.\n\nThe story is a bit hard to follow, and has a few flashbacks to a certain character(?)

It was a fun ending to play through, but it felt a little short, and a bit too easy. (However, it can feel hard for you, Just saying, there are harder levels.)\n\nConclusion.\nThe Game was a whole lot of fun, I loved it, and I'd like to see more from the community when the level editor comes out.

I loved the original, but Hotline Miami 2 is a game which isn't very fun. It's got all of the bad parts of the original and none of the good. I've actually given up playing this game multiple times just cause it's lost all charm. With the bigger levels, you can easily get shot from the other side of the map by enemies you cannot see. Therefore I cannot recommend this game. It's got all the bad parts of the original: Broken AI, Getting caught in doors, etc. and none of the originality that made it fun.

My 'R' key has reported me to the authoroties for numerous accounts of violence, assault, battery, and even sexual abuse, so before I go to jail I'll write this review.\n\nIt's...\n\nBeautiful.\n\nJust buy the game.\n\nPlay it.\n\nHotline Miami 2 places you into the role of multiple characters with different agendas, with their lives influenced by the events of the first game. You'll find that each character has their own quirks and abilities, and some characters are harder to use than others. The levels are hard, if I may say much harder than the levels of Hotline Miami one. There are more weapons, and more unique story elements.\n\nJust play the game, will ya? [Edited below]\n\nEdit: Now that I am no longer sleepy and rather, well...somewhat shocked (in a very, very good way, yet a sad one), I'll now take my time to list my pros and cons. Cons first, pros last. Both for story and gameplay.\n\nCons -\nPlaying as Alex and Ash, Ash sometimes tends to be stuck (But even with that being said they were my favourite characters).\n\nWhile it was expected, we no longer get to choose unique masks, but on a brighter note we do get to select things in certain levels.\n\nSome personal expectancies in the story weren't quite met, then again either I've missed something...Or the end isn't the end.\n\nA rather...Downer conclusion...\n\nPros -\n\nGameplay is a lot like in the first game, with twists, as characters have their own unique abilities that make combat with each character different.\n\nThe soundtrack. All of it. The menu song is just heart-wretching and tear-jerking, beautifully so, but it wasn't only the menu song that moved me. All songs are either groovy, melodic, or generally badass.\n\nUnique graphical style.\n\nImproved difficulty. Frustratingly fun.\n\nWell done story focusing on multiple characters, each of whom I actually liked except one. To avoid spoiling the story, I won't say who it was.\n\nPretty chill developers who refused to censor the game for Australia, and who are also pretty chill towards pirating the game. Props to you, lads and lasses!\n\nHotline Miami 2 is indeed a brutal conclusion, and the execution was great...\n\nOn another somewhat spoiler-esque note, I'll openly admit that, as stated, I really wish that the end wasn't the end. The ending wasn't poorly executed, but it seems somewhat anti-climatic.","March 11, 2015","true","91.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","6","9","4","0"

I still enjoyed the game overall and would recommend it to fans of the original but a lot of the things they changed just don't work that well and slow down the pace of the game, where part of the original game's appeal and what made it successful was how fast it moved.\n\nThe outdoor areas seemed to drag for me and often turned into me firing a gun to distract a few enemies at a time and dispose of them before moving onto the next group. They end up being frustrating and tedious which is how I never felt while playing the first game, no matter how many times I had to restart a level, except for the hospital level of course.\n\nI was also disappointed by the story. I thought I would find it more interesting since I enjoyed the few scraps of story in the original game but it never resolves any of the plot points in an interesting way. It just kind of slowed down the game some more.\n\nI don't think it was a bad game. I think I still mostly enjoyed it but I'm probably not going to replay it like I did with the first game.\n\nBut at least the soundtrack was still amazing. I don't regret buying the vinyl LP soundtrack for the game at all.","March 15, 2015","true","6.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

Of course, you're free to approach them, but their field of view is a lot higher than yours, and it's close to certain that they'll tag you before they become visible.\n\nThe fast-paced play of the original is again stifled by an odd choice to move the ending of the brutal finishers to a player-controlled RMB click. I don't know why automatically completing the move has been dropped (Can I change it to automatically detach from what remains of my enemy's body? Let me know).\n\nWeapons, while largely unchanged from its predecessor, come in a state of limbo as to whether your current character can use them, will unload them, or will either completely ignore to pick them up. (Act 2, L1. He failed to pick up butterfly knife?)\n\nI hate that I have to leave a negative review. Seriously, HM is easily one of the greatest indie games of the 2010s, and with the developers stating that this is the last in the series, it's frustrating that it is being left in such a state.\n\nMaybe I do just need to "git gud".

The other issue is that if your being chased by a line of enemies, the enemies at the back of the line can see and shoot you through the enemies in front, but you can't do the same, which leads to many BS deaths.\n\nMany of the levels are just too long as well, the biggest offender to this would be the boat level and the sewer level, both of these levels have a lot of blind firing in them due to long hall ways/open space which even with the shift look are too long, and lead to you being distracted and easily being killed from behind and weaponed enemies in front.\n\nMoving onto the good points, the regardless of the previous issues, the game is still fun and addictive and very fun to play, and the soundtrack is like ear porn. Regardless of its issues it's still a fun game to play, but for fans of the first game, it's not the same experience.\n","March 16, 2015","true","79.4"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","9","15","2","0"

Hotline Miami 2 is a way bigger sequel and is larger then the first one in almost every aspect. The game takes place Before, between and after the events of Hotline Miami. Showing diffrent perspectives on the murders and what happend after them. I could go in depth with the story but i would spoil an already amazing story. So how is this game ? So far this is my favorite game of 2015 and is my personal pick for GOTY. Even though the game looks the same it's not and actually it's quite diffrent. The game is even harder than 1 and at some times could feel harsh but it never is too unfair that you want to stop playing. Unlike the first game the story takes the stage as the more important factor to the game and it nails it perfectly. Every story you play through is engaging and you want to see how everything wraps up together. The levels are bigger than the ones you see in the first one which could lead to many deaths. The game is also pretty buggy at the moment but like the first one it should be patched this week. The soundtrack which was important in the first one is ten times better in two. The soundtrack will keep you on you're toes the entire time. Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number is a thrilling ride which you all should expierence at least once. This game is full of twists and turns along the way. After the ending i sat in my chair because i was speechless how good the game was. Without a doubt get this game right now because it's one of the best games i have ever played. I give Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number a 10/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","March 11, 2015","true","50.3"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dinoracha/recommended/274170/","dinoracha","Dinoracha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dinoracha/","426 products in account","There’s always a dangerous line to travel when a sequel is made, especially when the previous installments are successful or have a healthy modicum of acceptance from consumers. Straying too far from the original formula can make the sequel feel removed and disjointed from what made the previous game good, and sticking too close to the original can come off as lazy or apathetic. Dennaton certainly did not have an easy job on their hands making a sequel to Hotline Miami, and while the gameplay from the previous game is as strong and snappy as ever, what additions were made end up bloating the new installment while punishing the player for playing wildly.\n\nOddly the biggest disappointment I have right out of the gate is the story-telling. The first game was quite memorable due to the story, which kind of didn’t really care if you were following along clearly or not. Sure, with enough observation and putting puzzle pieces together you could get some idea, but it never really stopped to explain things, just chugging along to the next scene to give you more violence and combos to build in order to get that high score. In Hotline Miami 2, I can’t help but feel like there was damage control because of that, and now there’s too much story being fed to the player. Many characters are brought in to flesh out the narrative, like the Fans who are following in Jacket’s footsteps, or Evan, the journalist writing about all the mayhem and getting involved in ways he wasn’t hoping for. Yes, this does mean you get a nice break between segments to be in someone else’s shoes and potentially have different playstyles (Evan’s lack of killing, the Fans acting as Jackets’ different masks from the first game), but I can’t shake the weird feeling that between Hotline Miami 1 and 2, it felt like there was an obligation to play catch up and bog down the game with narrative just for the sake of putting some clarity to the mayhem.\n\nThe second major disappointment comes from the larger, more densely populated maps the game throws you in. While bigger maps should mean more attack strategies, higher scores and longer combos to chain, we mustn't forget that a single, errant mistake means death and restarting the screen. In the first game, playing like a madman often had the end result of clearing screens by the skin of your teeth, adapting in the middle of a skirmish and having very hectic, though incredibly satisfying victories. A death would cost you very little, and only during the later acts when the maps got larger, and more risky did you have to slow down and plan a bit more thoroughly. The player was nearing the end of the game, so the increase in difficulty was to be expected. In Hotline Miami 2, the difficulty of larger, more involved maps starts far sooner than in the original, and is expected, reckless, wild rampages will be shot down far more swiftly and feel much more painful in the process. It’s not the difficulty of the game or the easy death of your character that’s the issue, it’s that the bigger maps that almost seem to demand that you lure waves of enemies into a bottleneck before you horribly end their lives time and time again, and any improvisation during a frantic deviation from this strategy has a high cost regarding your time and patience. Having to clear a level using turtle tactics and purposeful pacing rather than going bonkers through the place and getting a poor score/rating at the end of it all was a frequent reminder of why the first game was far easier to digest and have bloodier enjoyment of. And doors somehow have gotten worse. WORSE.\n\nThe soundtrack for me is the biggest shining point of this sequel, as while the first game had a far more memorable OST that stuck with me afterwards, Hotline Miami 2′s music feels much more solid across the board in out of game listening, but it lacks that memorable punch that the first soundtrack had. To say that the music is the most noteworthy part of the game doesn’t entirely speak poorly of Hotline Miami 2′s gameplay which, excluding the need to take encounters on a lot more slowly than intended, it remains as it was in the first game.\n\nEven if we exclude the reported problems that rose during the Steam launch of Hotline Miami 2 of controller play not functioning, Windows XP support being sketchy and the fact that the godforsaken executable did not work on day one for many consumers, I walk away from the game feeling incredibly disappointed on a personal level, while feeling frustrated on the technical side of things. Yes, it is more Hotline, but the attempts of sticking to the original formula while shoving borderline fanfiction-esque narrative upon me made things more and more difficult to swallow, and the ending itself feels like a gigantic middle finger to the player for going through everything they had to see things through to the end. I can only recommend Hotline Miami 2 to those who greatly enjoyed the first game or those who found the first game much too easy. Too much disappointment has remained on a personal and technical level, and it’s because of this that I must unfortunately say that for anyone else curious about Hotline Miami 2, it’s a pass - The first game is your much better bet.","April 6, 2015","false","7.5"," 30 of 56 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","30","56","3","3"

I love hotline miami, the way you could tackle the levels in your own style made it an amazing expirience i had yet to feel from a pixelated game. This itteration of the series has many faults, from technical errors to gameplay descisions. The story feels very natural, however that is not where this game lacks. It lacks in the freedom of choice to take on levels the way you see fit, in hotline miami you had several masks to take on levels with which could be found while playing. Wrong Number does not offer this, instead it offers different playable characters each level, such as being character locked into a detective with nothing special about him, making the whole level only a puzzle in which you can solve only in a few ways. Not to mention, the game is also extremely short, im sure there are hidden secrets i have not found yet, but frankly i do not want to find them after what i played through, I do not want a game that tells me what to do to win, i want a game that i can tackle in a multitude of ways. I want to give this game a good review, but it does not deserve one in my opinion.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/274170/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","We again get a unbelievably good soundtrack, but now this game has some heavy technical problems, making this an inferior game to the first one in that regard. One of the rare times I agree with a PC Gamer review. They gave it a 58/100 because of its technical problems combined with being a pure bait-and-kill/die-by-window-in-every-level simulator and it deserves it. This is like a stab in the heart for HM fans because it is a far cry from HM1. I was looking forward to this game in 2015 probably more than any other and this is one of my biggest disappointments ever in gaming. It isn't a "bad" game by any means, just where the first game's gameplay would be a 9/10, this one's gameplay is a 6. The music is, while maybe not quite as remarkable overall as the first game since that soundtrack was so incredible that topping it is almost an impossibility, still is easily a 9/10 amazing, but the rest of the game is about a 6/10 at best. It is infinitely tougher than the first game for all the wrong reasons. This is just a long exercise in getting shot through windows from off-screen, playing bait and kill, and repeatedly mashing the R key to respawn dozens and dozens of times more than in the first game. This game feels like a chore where the first felt fun. An excerpt from PC World's 3-star review sums this game up perfectly (non-verbatim): "You end up playing it as a top-down cover-based shooter with exceptionally poor AI. You pop out, let one or two enemies see you, then jump back into cover while they sprint towards you. Then you kill them as they round the corner and repeat until all enemies are dead. It's a lengthy game of peek-a-boo where if you peek too long someone shoots you in the face and you start all over. There's none of the improvisational murder of the first game." I couldn't have said it better.\n\nOne thing that is a cool change of pace is the guy who uses melee only and when you pick up a gun he just unloads it and throws it on the ground. He is either a pacifist, a total badass, or really stupid. I like to pretend that he is so badass that the thought of using a gun never crossed his mind, kinda like Jackie Chan or Bill the Butcher from Gangs of New York. The guy who fires his gun with left click and switches to and swings melee with right click and has to refill ammo at ammo crates because he refuses to pick up any enemies guns doesn't make any sense but it is something new and is not really a bad thing except that his knife range is too short making melee kills a crap shoot against enemies with longer weapons like machetes. There is much more dialogue in this game, much much more, and the story so far has been ridiculous and bewildering, very confusingly switching back and forth between story lines. According to www.howlongtobeat.com the game is around 8 hours long which is substantially longer than the first game which could be beaten in well under two hours. So far that is the best thing about this game, its length. That and they deliver another great soundtrack.\n\nProblems I've seen so far:\n\n- Horribly unfair compared to HM1. Tons of levels just feel exhausting because of the sheer amount of times you will be repeatedly hitting the R key to retry an area since the game is pure trial and error frustration.\n- Your gunshots will often not trigger the guy standing right next to the guy you killed, or even the guys in the next room, but guys from across the map will run in like a raging bull.\n- Sometimes guys will get stuck in a door frame and glitch around and have to be melee killed otherwise all bullets pass through them.\n-Sometimes dogs will start spinning in place until you trigger or kill them.\n- The character that uses a locked weapon and switches to melee with right click, his knife range is way too short, making killing enemies with larger weapons like machetes a 50/50 chance.\n- Sometimes when luring an enemy to you they will stop short of the doorway and gun shots will miss then he kills you or your pop-out melee surprise attack will be awkwardly misplaced and he just blankly drops you with 1 bullet.\n- Enemy reactions seem random sometimes. Sometimes a guy will move and shoot at you then other times he may act glitchy or different, making certain spots in some levels sometimes luck-based.\n- Most of my deaths come from unavoidable off-screen kills because the game is zoomed in too far to see anything and enemy view range is absurd, making this game feel purely like trial and error because it is missing all of the freedom that made the first game so good.\n-Sometimes the weapon throw simply will not work right and nothing happens and I get shot down.\n- The game is ripe with a ton of areas with windows, almost every level, that you can be seen through and then shot by bad guys that are off screen. You won't know this until some trial and error and it isn't exactly fair. It makes the game largely a bait game where you have to hide around a corner and draw guys to you then kill them, unlike the first game where you could just go about the level the way you choose and it still managed to be a very difficult game.\n- This game is unnecessarily much harder than the first game because of all of its technical problems, making it so brutally hard that I am beginning to sound like Raymond Babbitt constantly saying “yeah...” each time I get killed which is at least 15-25 times in tough areas before I get it right. Some areas in HM1 had you dying as many times but it really felt like you were dying because of your own error, not because of the game's like it often does here.\n- For the first hour or so the game does not show you its great soundtrack but finally into the third act it kicks in with some amazing tunes. The tune that plays on the score screen is good but takes way too long to get started so unless you want to stare at the score screen for about thirty to forty five seconds waiting to hear it, you won't hear it. It doesn't make much sense because the awesome tune on the score screen in HM1 got started almost immediately.\n- Masks in this game have much less meaning because you do not always get to choose a mask and when you do, each character is limited to certain masks that other characters can't use, making it feel like a lot of choice has been stripped away from you in this game which it has.\n- The idea of having two guys on some missions is really cool, but not executed very well. If you want to shoot guys you have to make sure your second guy is out in the clear open so he isn't still sitting behind a wall firing into it while you are out in the open expecting to shoot the enemy and instead shoot into the wall and get killed since the main guy has just a chainsaw.\n- The chainsaw is awesome but again needs better execution. The big black guys that are tougher to kill, when I attack them he sticks the chainsaw into his stomach and grinds away for a while, leaving my guy wide open for a kill from the other incoming guys, making it tough to single the black guy out for a  lone kill. You can't use your secondary guy to fire his gun at them while you saw up the big guy because of course you will be behind a wall and his bullets will hit jack sh-t.\n- The story makes absolutely zero sense until you read a summary in the forums or wherever.\n\nWish it was a better game but it is still Hotline Miami so it is better than the other garbage Devolver puts out like Luftrausers. Despite its many flaws it still manages to be a fun playthrough, however much so a fairly stunted one. Thank God the amazing new-retro music keeps it above water.\nMusic 8.5/10, sometimes 9/10, Graphics/effects 9/10, Gameplay 6/10\nHM1 I gave a 9/10 overall\nHM2 I give a 6/10 overall. Highly disappointing and it makes me feel really helpless because there is nothing I or anyone else can do about it.","March 20, 2015","true","13.2"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","15","27","0","0"

The fun of being able to complete levels in a fast and twitchy way racking up combos with your favorite mask is gone. Most levels are either designed with one mask in mind or do not even give you a mask. I found myself often camping corners waiting and luring people towards me away from the open rooms they spawned it. While in the first game I would often run in, knocking out one gunman with a thrown brick and proceeding to bash the others head in with a hammer that was on the ground. To me this game is a downgrade, removing the parts that made the first game amazing and leaving in the mechanics I did not like from the later levels of the first game.\n\nOn a numerical scale I would give this game a 6/10.

The poorly-designed, wide-open levels that nobody particularly liked but played anyway? That is basically every level in Hotline Miami 2.\n\nAfter you finish the introductory mission designed to help familiarize you with the controls again, the missions are very hard. Not challenging, just hard. With enough repetition, you will memorize where the enemies hide off-screen and the best corners to hide in, but it doesn't feel like the same controlled chaos of the first game. Hotline Miami rewarded you for the creativity, variety and speed with which you dispatched enemies, but HL2 never quite gives you the same autonomy; you basically have to stick to one particular path in order to complete a mission and stay alive.\n\nThe new character abilities feel more like gimmicks than helpful tools. I never found a practical use for shooting two guns in two directions. The combat roll is bound to the same key you use to execute downed enemies; it got me killed more than it saved me. The twins (which you control at the same time, similiar to the Ice Climbers) don't work well together, either. The secondary character follows you around and can use a gun, but it's not possible to peek corners with her or effectively mow people down. I used her as an attention-getter for luring people into the primary character's melee weapon around the corner more than anything else.\n\nI have high-hopes for the user-created content, but between the poor level design and half-baked masks and weapons, the campaign felt very forced compared to the first game. All that said, it's hard to say this is a "bad" game. It just doesn't seem like it builds on what Hotline Miami created; it's just more of the same but with longer, more frustrating missions.\n\nIf you enjoyed the first one, it's worth playing. Just don't expect much.","March 19, 2015","true","8.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

That was fun and interesring!\nThe mask mechanic has been ramped up. And by that, I mean, the mask effects ('mask'. Not all the characters wear masks.) are so absolutely diverse, and it's excellent.\nThe combat, like the first game, is satisfying and fun. The weapons are more diverse, and it's fun.\nThe cons:\nThe game is janky as hell in many ways. For one, AI jumps between being hyperaware to the point of being superhuman, and between being so unaware that they must have brain damage. This makes planning ahead very difficult, not fully knowing how quickly the AI will react.\nA big issue I had is that, although the doors appear to be wood, thay seem to function as pure durasteel, seeing as they are utterly inpenetrable. This wouldn't be a problem so much if some of the AI (namely the attack dogs) weren't able to attack through doors. This gave me a whole lot of grief and I ended up being frustrated more often than not.\nThe AI also have hawkeyes, and they'll often bullseye you from the other side of the level. This is alleviated somewhat by the ability to 'aim', which allows you to look farther. Not far enough, though, most of the time.\nAlso, you don't add pseudo boss fights where you need to run in circles until something happens that allows you to fight the boss some time after running in circle, but you still don't know how, and you die in one hit. THIS IS NOT FUN. This is just frustrating.\n\nIn a nutshell, I would say that overall, I enjoyed this game. There's just a lot to be frustrated over. There's a large portion of the game that I still look at and thing: 'Did I have fun?'   I really cannot tell.\n\nIt's worth its price though. I'd give it a buy. If you enjoy it, great. If not-... It didn't cost you all that much. If it's on sale, even better!","March 21, 2015","true","12.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Players who were head over heels with Hotline Miami 1 will find themselves having an awkward affair with the sequel. The game sheds a large portion of the beserker rushes in favour of a more tactical, slow approach. Wrong Number has a much greater focus on guns than the first, and you will encounter multiple levels with very little cover, plenty of open space, and a lot of goons with assault rifles and shotguns. The level design deteriorates later in the game focusing on ranged combat and, in my opinion, far too many windows. Let go of the blind instinct-based rushes in the first game. A brain with those strategies hardwired in will suffer in this one, but I still recommend the game, with all its gory violence and glorious songs. Remember, though, to be wary of windows.\n","March 20, 2015","true","10.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

If Hotline II wasn't as good, I would have been really upset.  Alas, my fears were for nought.  This sequel is just as Earth-shattering as its predecessor.\n\nThe Hotline series features some of the best rogue-like action in all of gamedom.  The pixel art is top-notch and the atmosphere created by said art perfectly fitting for the ethereal and dizzying plot you are thrown into.  This is another game that will make you sweat, possibly cause your heart to palpitate, and give you the adrenaline rush of a lifetime.  Every victory is hardwon and makes you feel like the biggest, baddest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the entire Universe.  New weapons, fighting styles and masks await you.\n\nNot only are the gameplay and art supreme, but the soundtrack actually features music by really good musicians and drives the game.  The DJs from the original Hotline Miami soundtrack take turns remixing each other's work, so it's not perhaps a 100% original soundtrack, but it's worth picking up all the same.  This series is the first where I've actually listened to the soundtrack outside of playing the game or playing other games.  As someone who is an amateur musician and who grew up around professional musicians, I often find game soundtracks lacking, but this ♥♥♥♥ is good.  These DJs do 80's synth better than the ♥♥♥♥ing 80's.\n\nAlso, as a bonus, if you haven't yet purchased the game a level editor that was originally supposed to be released with the game has finally popped its head out of the ground.  I haven't tested it out yet, but the potential to edit levels in a HM game is highly intriguing to me.\n\nOnce again, one of my favorite games of all time.","December 30, 2015","true","20.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

And well,in hotline miami 2 you get to know it,things start to make sense and a lot of minor things that are said and shown in the first game have their importance in the sequel(*MINOR SPOILER HERE* For example what was that photo jacket was holding in the end of hotline miami *SPOILER ENDS HERE*). You get to know more about the characters background(the ones from the first game) and also what happened to them. The ending was hard to catch at first,but after you replay some missions and dig up some things everything feels connected.\n+The Soundtrack is still great\n+It felt confusing at first,but having lots of playable characters was a nice thing for me\n-The one bad thing about the game and that has been said by EVERYONE. WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ ARE SOME AREAS SO BIG?  TOO MANY ♥♥♥♥ING WINDOWS! Most of the time you are in the end of a area you get shot by some random ♥♥♥♥ from the other side of the level. You have to camp too much and firearms are way too important in this game. One of the best things from the first game was going around a area kicking the ♥♥♥♥ out of everyone with all kinds of melee weapons while listening to some badass tunes,and in this game this kind of ♥♥♥♥ barely happens.\n\n-Conclusion: It is a great game,brilliant like the first,i dont think i liked it more then the first but i definetely also loved it.

Mechanically the game feels smoother for the most part, however I found myself frequently frustrated by enemies miles away killing me, getting stuck on furniture, and dying due to the crosshair jumping around after I killed an enemy it was locked onto.  Some new characters are fun, like the murder swans, but most play like Jacket… however dodge roll is kind of useless, it gets me killed more times than it saved me.  There are some odd level designs, and some levels overstay their welcome (like the boat level), but those minor issues aside, the game is pretty solid and a lot of fun, though it does make you feel a bit bad.

It's just that, though - an excellent follow up. If you're interested in getting into this series, definitely start off with the first game.\n\nI'm someone who actually prefers this game to the original, however. If you played the first game, the levels are more similar to the biker levels after Jacket's story wrapped up than the original Jacket style. If you haven't played the first game, stop reading this review and go play the first game because at this point in time this review is worthless to you.\n\nIn short, though - less focus on masks and varied gameplay styles and more focused on characters. It's less open ended as a result of this, and while removing the Jacket style in favor of characters with set abilities for each level is something I'd normally cry heresy over, this game manages to execute it extremely well to the point where I didn't even care that I wasn't given a huge variety of masks to choose from and had a lot of gameplay freedom taken away. This sounds much worse than it is, trust me - this game hits the nail on the head with what it's trying to do and it's excellent as a result.\n\nIt also is a lot more difficult than the first game, I think; the levels are larger and there can be a pretty serious loss of progress once you get towards the end and die, as opposed to the original's tendency to have smaller levels. As a result, there is a lot more enemies. There's also less masks, as I noted earlier, and that can create a handicap for those who relied on certain masks in the first game and being able to have more variety.\n\nIt's as violent as ever, thankfully. This game pulls no punches in how graphic it is, and it benefits from as much for certain. One of the things I love about both games of this series is that it gives me an outlet to battle stress by allowing me to vent my psychotic urges to just beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of anybody I can. Much blood, very graphic executions (except for evan lol), but I might just give the first game the edge in the gore and violence department if that much is your thing.\n\nAs for the story, it pieces a bunch of the events of the first game into context and gives them meaning, as the first game could be pretty incoherent and schizophrenic with the story it tried to tell. It was an effective stylistic choice, for certain, but this game serves as providing context for the events of the first game and it's why I'm telling you to go play the first game if you haven't played it yet. This game expects you to know the first game. Back on topic, though - the story is surprisingly powerful in this game. From memorable characters such as Richter to Beard to the Fans, it manages to show just how ♥♥♥♥ed up everything is in a way that has a lot of powerful moments. I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't go into any plot details, but the story is fantastic and surprisingly gave me the feels on a few occasions.\n\nLastly, the soundtrack - it's as ♥♥♥♥♥in' as ever. Seriously, the soundtrack is even better than the first game and can hit like a truck. This is seriously one of the greatest soundtracks in any game ever and I can totally get behind the soundtrack itself costing as much as the game - it's actually worth it.\n\ntl;dr - this game expects you to know the first so go play that if you haven't already. If you have, there's an excellent story being told here alongside some absolutely amazing gameplay and one of the greatest soundtracks you'll find anywhere.\n\n10/10, i liked hurting other people\n\n","September 22, 2015","true","12.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It answers question left by the first game and gives you the ability to play as multiple characters throughout the game.

Antrider","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LFantrider/","426 products in account","This game is absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing great.\n\nI feared its release because Hotline Miami quickly became one of my favorite games after playing it.  If Hotline II wasn't as good, I would have been really upset.  Alas, my fears were for nought.  This sequel is just as Earth-shattering as its predecessor.\n\nThe Hotline series features some of the best rogue-like action in all of gamedom.  The pixel art is top-notch and the atmosphere created by said art perfectly fitting for the ethereal and dizzying plot you are thrown into.  This is another game that will make you sweat, possibly cause your heart to palpitate, and give you the adrenaline rush of a lifetime.  Every victory is hardwon and makes you feel like the biggest, baddest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the entire Universe.  New weapons, fighting styles and masks await you.\n\nNot only are the gameplay and art supreme, but the soundtrack actually features music by really good musicians and drives the game.  The DJs from the original Hotline Miami soundtrack take turns remixing each other's work, so it's not perhaps a 100% original soundtrack, but it's worth picking up all the same.  This series is the first where I've actually listened to the soundtrack outside of playing the game or playing other games.  As someone who is an amateur musician and who grew up around professional musicians, I often find game soundtracks lacking, but this ♥♥♥♥ is good.  These DJs do 80's synth better than the ♥♥♥♥ing 80's.\n\nAlso, as a bonus, if you haven't yet purchased the game a level editor that was originally supposed to be released with the game has finally popped its head out of the ground.  I haven't tested it out yet, but the potential to edit levels in a HM game is highly intriguing to me.\n\nOnce again, one of my favorite games of all time.","December 30, 2015","true","20.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zdorovatsya/recommended/274170/","zdorovatsya","kys XD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zdorovatsya/","127 products in account","This is a good game. Taken alone, however, it's worth is greatly diminished. A number of things must be considered before you can understand what to appropriately classify this game.\n\nReasonably, it can be understood that this game will never be able to live up to the expectations set by the first one. The story is too open, the understanding of this story is far too skewed and all over the place, the sound track is lacking in some places where HM had a perfect track record, and the level design is just plain lazy and "challenging" in an uncreative way.\n\nI love this game. I feel this way because I played the first one. If I hadn't of played the first one obsessively for the years it was out until I mastered it and then switched over to this game, I believe I would have greatly been disappointed, confused, let down, and angry, even.\n\nThe only way I could suggest this game with a smile on my face and a light behind my eyes would be if the other person was an avid player of the original and as enthusiastic about the universe as I was when I played the game originally. It's just, especially when taken out of context, not as good a game as the first, and, really, not even that good of a game.\n\nMy love for it, however, is unwielding because I love the developers, their ideas, and their games. I love what they have done and I would support another Hotline Miami game no matter how disgustingly out of character and out of universe it was, because I feel that they understand what they are doing with the universe and I'd trust them to lead this story to new bounds untold.\n\nBut that is not the case.\n\nThis is the last Hotline Miami game to come out with a story made personally by the developers, and thus, it is left to the community to understand what must be done with their Levil Editor, and it is left to the community to decide and judge what worth this universe still holds. And I, as a member of the community, feel that if the original HM game was a massive leap forwards into an unknown abyss filled with bright lights, bloodied tile floors, frightening monsters, and dead Russians all mixed up in a psychadelic guilt tirp, then the second Hotline Miami was tripping off the sidewalk onto the street and vomiting repeatedly until the cops came and had to shove them back on the sidewalk just so they could get home.\n\nI will recommend this game because I feel people need to play it, but know I am not happy about it.\n\nThis game could have been better. I bet the community themselves could take the levels, story, characters, and arc, remake them all, and make a better game with the editor.\n\nI wish I felt better about recommending this.","November 1, 2015","true","41.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is hotline 2 , gorgeous , the soundtrack amazes you every time you start a new level , the character playstiles are unique , most of them have a mask system or weapons to choose your "special skills" so you can make your own strategy . Most of hotline 2's levels happens simultaneously with the ones in the first game , increasing the imersion of the player on the game lore . The hardmode really disapointed me , it's pure stupidity , the number of thugs on the levels increase , making the usage of fireweapons required , destroying the players liberty to choose how to perform the level , as after you shoot you'll have all the enemies chasing you already , and all the levels are upside down , besides moving from the bottom , to the top , you'll do the opposite , sounds simple , but it's extremelly annoying . Something else I'd like to point out about this game is the replay value , In hotline 1 , you had to get in , kill everybody , and get out , all the levels were like that , on hotline 2 , the levels seem to be more specific , and for me , made them less fun to keep playing over and over again . I recommend this game and I think it's a great sequel for the legendary hotline miami .\n\n7.5/10","April 1, 2015","true","9.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And really,Hotline Miami 2 did not let me down,here is why:\n+A lot of ♥♥♥♥ was left unanswered in the first game(wich i think was a fantastic thing),so lots ot theories came up trying to explain the game. And well,in hotline miami 2 you get to know it,things start to make sense and a lot of minor things that are said and shown in the first game have their importance in the sequel(*MINOR SPOILER HERE* For example what was that photo jacket was holding in the end of hotline miami *SPOILER ENDS HERE*). You get to know more about the characters background(the ones from the first game) and also what happened to them. The ending was hard to catch at first,but after you replay some missions and dig up some things everything feels connected.\n+The Soundtrack is still great\n+It felt confusing at first,but having lots of playable characters was a nice thing for me\n-The one bad thing about the game and that has been said by EVERYONE. WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ ARE SOME AREAS SO BIG?  TOO MANY ♥♥♥♥ING WINDOWS! Most of the time you are in the end of a area you get shot by some random ♥♥♥♥ from the other side of the level. You have to camp too much and firearms are way too important in this game. One of the best things from the first game was going around a area kicking the ♥♥♥♥ out of everyone with all kinds of melee weapons while listening to some badass tunes,and in this game this kind of ♥♥♥♥ barely happens.\n\n-Conclusion: It is a great game,brilliant like the first,i dont think i liked it more then the first but i definetely also loved it.

Seriously, best soundtracks I've ever heard and most brilliant storyline I've ever seen! It's a shame that they won't make a third game for this sequel. Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number explains a lotta unexplained stuff in first Hotline Miami. This time you're not playing as Jacket or Biker. You get a chance to talk with the Biker after a scene but only for a little time. We have like 9 or 10 protagonists in Hotline Miami 2 and each has their own story. Some of them connected to Jacket but most of them connected to 50 Blessings. Game mostly explains what happens after the brutal events of Jacket and other masked vigilanties. You even get a chance to play as The Son - head of the Russian Mafia, son of the villain of first Hotline Miami. You also get a chance to play as Manny Pardo which is my favorite character due to his style and brutality. He's a detective and he kills people to get the attention of the media. He also his own detective which makes him a very interesting guy. You all remember that guy who gives us free stuff in first Hotline Miami, right? Well, you get to play as him, too!

I have to give it a 7.5/10. There is great music, action, story (kinda), new characters, weapons, and much more. Although the level designs can be unfair as there are gunmen far down a hall who you can't see but then they see you. Also as you may know the spinning dogs and people glich that can skrew you over and Ash lagging behind Alex. Which can cost you a life when a gun is needed.

Brand new levels, characters, "plot", weapons and a great soundtrack. Overall, if you loved the first one you'll love this one.\n\nTo start, the level design once again is superb. Playing the different levels was like a breath of fresh air compared to the original HM. The levels were all compatible with the new characters and gave each of them a fair chance to still win, where in the original HM, if I picked a mask that was horrible with that map then I would restart almost on the spot. In some levels, you can see where a certain mask would be used.\n\nThere are Five main characters. Corey, Mark, Tony, Alex and Ash (You play as Ash and Alex at the same time). There are also many side characters that you play as, but I feel they are only used to support the plot. I was upset that there were only 4 mask in the game, but these mask are more helpful then most of the mask in HM. Corey allows you to dodge under bullets, helpful for getting away. Mark Allows you to shoot in 2 different directions (see trailer). Tony is the same as in the first game. Alex and Ash are my favorite, as it allows you melee and shoot at the same time. One of them wields a chainsaw, while the other holds a pistol. This is really important for those moments when you need to melee an enemy when another one is far away. Currently, there is a bug that makes ash teleport. I hope this gets fixed soon\n\nI don't understand the plot, but I know that there is more plot then the first game, which is nice.\n\nAs for weapons, there is the standard shotgun and lead pipe. With the inclusion of the Chainsaw and the AK, the whole gun lineup seems to harmonize. Although there are a LOT less melee weapons. So if you loved the ninja blade, bad news.\n\nI feel that the new soundtrack is better then the old one. It's a lot more upbeat when it needs to be. Which I felt was something that needed to be changed in the first game. The new soundtrack is a great addition to the game.\n\nOverall. This game is a great sequel that I have been waiting for a long time. Although much more graphic then the first (Hard to believe isn't it). That doesn't change the quality of the game.","March 11, 2015","true","10.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

The story has you switching between different characters some of which have unique abilities. The game is a bit harder than the first game on the earlier levels. More enemies have guns and the game is just as challenging as ever. However, you wont mind dying over and over again because the soundtrack is awesome. You can twitch shoot your way and go speedrunning through the levels, or you can strategize your attack and ambush enemies as you move room to room. You will probably end up having to play both ways regardless. If you've played the first game you are going to like this. If you haven't played the first game read up on it, and be prepared for a challenge.","March 10, 2015","true","10.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So finally I can recommend this game! The Linux port seems to be well done so far, kudos to Abstraction Games. It runs reasonable on my ancient laptop with Nvidia propietary driver, with OpenGL 2.1.2 (you don't neccessarily need OpenGL 3.2, however I play windowed mode in 1024x768 or something on my wooden PC.)\n\nAbout the game itself I agree with most positive reviews. The game's pacing is different than the first game, but I like it, because I wanted more than a few new maps/levels for the first game. ...and dat soundtrack! (comes in mp3 and flac and is two times larger than the game itself.)\n\nOnly thing missing is a non-binary text config file like hotline.cfg for HLM1, e.g. for more custom windowed resolution modes. Devs saying this will come with a future patch, so far the file window.dat is binary. Yeah, I played 50 hours of HLM1 in 640x480 window with black borders and I enjoyed it.\n\nAnd a DLC/checkbox in the >properties tab (Steam library) would be nice, to disable the Soundtrack's download temporarily, if you have it already elsewhere and don't want to re-download the 2GB again and again.","March 11, 2015","true","39.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The first HLM's gameplay could be described as "Rainbow Six for lunatics", involving careful choices of how you attacked rooms. It was think-on-your-feet action, while HLM 2 feels very much like each map has a planned route for you to use.\n\nThe big problem with HLM2 is its map design-it's atrocious. HLM 1 was mostly short-range planning of rooms. HLM 2 largely forces you to shoot enemies offscreen, snipe through wide open spaces, or stand around a corner murdering every enemy as your first shot forces them all to chase you down from anywhere in the level. There are also weird inconsistencies like the random weapon spawns at the start giving you melee weapons when there's a group of enemies straight ahead that are completely invulnerable to melee.\n\nOverall, this just felt unfinished and devoid of the gameplay/map design of the first game. It would have been fine if they wanted to take things in a new direction gameplay-wise, but none   of the mechanics or enemy AI has not been updated to suit the wide-open design of the levels.. It's the definition of arbitrary difficulty, while the well-crafted difficulty of the first game is completely non-existant here.","May 31","false","7.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/recommended/274170/","Brian_Colfxire","Brian C. (The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","Hotline Miami 2 has put me in an odd predicament for a review.\n\nIf you played the original as a stealthy player--like me--then you'll find the game unforgivably broken due to the original's problems becoming worse. Also, if you liked the extremely vague plot with no purpose in the end, then you might find the "sequel's" context to get in the way.\n\nOn the other hand, I inevitably came to love the game when I gave up my old style. I found replaying old levels like Rambo (though cautious) more enjoyable, and it helped me finish the rest of the game. As for the story, I couldn't understand the first game's plot besides its nihilistic message about game narratives when it comes to the mechanics. So having more context and characters was a bonus.\n\nI guess the easiest way to recommend this title is if you can appreciate the changes made from HLM1, then you'll love HLM2. If you prefer the classic's style of narrative and gameplay, then you probably should stay with the original.\n\nStill An Eyestrain\nThe same problems with lacking options for visuals are apparent in the sequel.\n\nSo if bright lights, motion-swaying and changing colors in the background bother you, then I don't think this series is one you should play. And if you thought the camera-swaying was bad in the original, then you have not used a sniper-rifle in HLM2. It's vomit-inducing.\n\nHowever, the developers did add rebindable keys for all characters' actions--except for the dodge-roll which is mapped to the execute button--so it's a step-up from the original. Though I'm surprised there aren't more PC pitchforks raised at this series.\n\n(There's also a "graphic content" setting that disables a two-second ♥♥♥♥ scene at the start. I don't care that the content is in the game nor the setting to turn it off. My question is what was the point of adding that to the game--or the character--because it doesn't feel relevant to the rest of the narrative. Nor is there any visual penetration to make it that graphic. In the end, it just comes across as needlessly edgy.)\n\nSmooth Consistency from Start to End\nThe best change from its predecessor is that the whole game now plays like a top-down "tactical" murder-puzzle shooter. There are three basic enemy types--two from the first title and a new one that is immune to bullets--and there's a better focus on creating variety throughout the game with a smaller number of "masks"/playable characters.\n\nGone is the curve-balling car that spawns enemies, the unkillable police-forces ambushing you with sniper-rifles aimed at the windows, and the god-awful bosses that break the rules of the HLM1. (There is only one boss-level in HLM2 with several bosses, and they follow the same rules like other enemies.) Now we have a game that has consistent challenge.\n\nNow we get 24/25  similar levels that can last anywhere from under a minute to 15+ minutes. For the average person, there is probably 7+ hours of content, minimum, which is more than replaying HLM1 three-times. This is excluding the "Hard" mode, which not only flips the levels upside down but adds more enemies and takes away the aim-lock button.\n\nSo if the game is more of HLM1, then why does it also feel like a step-back from the previous game?\n\nBeing Literally Thrown with the Rule-Book\nThe main source of complaint is how HLM2 has taken away your options for how you play. As previously mentioned, you cannot get through this game playing conservatively all the time.\n\nThis problem comes from several sources: Having to play 10 playable characters--but not all are always available-- having three distinct "styles" of play, the nurfing of melee weapons, and the rules for some characters being thrown like a book to your face.\n\nThe reason for having so many characters is because of how the narrative is told in HLM2. Because the first game wasn't confusing enough, the sequel is a side-story, a prequel and a conclusion all in one. Changing from from one scene to the next randomly also alters the way you can play.\n\nSome characters you'll play have nothing special about them other than limitations. For example, the soldier character can only use one gun that he equips and he must find specific ammo boxes to get more. Or there's the news reporter who refuses to use guns unless you execute someone. These limitations are quite annoying when the game plays consistently throughout the whole game, forcing you to change your playstyle because the developers made it that way.\n\nWhen you do have options, such as when you're playing as the Fans, Jake or the Son, they all boil down to No Weapons (Fists only), start off with guns (or a nailgun), or you get some quirk that works with only one character. For example, there are these twins James & Ash that can be played simaltaneously as a glass-cannon of destruction.\n\nAll together, these changes go against a lot of what was appealing of the original. Masks gave you small bonuses but didn't limit your playstyle. Some even offered a new challenge. Best of all, these masks were available from beginning to end, excluding the hospital scene. That was enough to offer replayability, and the point is none of it was forced on you.\n\nNow whether these changes were made to make tighter levels and/or to tailor them for specific playstyles, the result is that the whole game can feel abrupt with its difficulty and give less of a reason to replay every level.\n\nSins of the Father Burdened to the Son\nPerhaps the worst change is how the new level design has made the original's problems worse. AI behavior is finicky at best, unfair at worst; enemies will shoot you beyond your line of sight all the time; and choosing the right weapon in the middle of the moment can get you killed.\n\nUnfortunately,like what you'd expect from sequels, HLM2 goes for the approach that bigger is always better. Instead of adding more floors/checkpionts in-between these each level, the game goes for making huge environments while using the same checkpoint system.\n\nThe larger environments simply do not work with the the enemy AI. This problem isn't sucking at the game or the trial-and-error gameplay of HLM1. Mooks can spot you a mile away from windows at an angle or two screens away, some of which will require a specific tactic to kill.\n\nThis problem will lead to needless deaths, which far outways the abuse if you could see enemies all the time. And because the AI can sometimes be unpredictable, your"solution" can sometimes feel unsatisfying or pure luck.\n\nMore Cryptic than the Wasteland\nAs for the story of HLM2... I like it, especially how it doesn't ruin the story for HLM1. The plot is ultimately the same result as the first game, a tale about nothing learned (in-game). However, now you have actual characters developed instead of characterizations being hinted at or unexplained.\n\nThe story will still make no sense your first playing--especially if you have not finished the first game or read the comic--because of how unorderly the narrative is told. It's a story that you'll piece together clues and dates either by noting them down yourself or by looking up videos on YouTube.  What I can say is that the narrative gives more substance to characters like Beard/Register-Man, Jacket (and Richard?) and the 50 Blessings.\n\nThe narrative could be clearer if there was a name listed to every face. You'll have to remember details like that, and note weird lines in relation to something maybe an hour later. And you'll probably still end up with more questions than answers--but the story is actually very interesting, and it could still be interpretted from various angles.\n\nPerhaps Not the Best Sequel, Though Still Good\nAlthough I am not a fan of the series, I'm glad I finished HLM2. It's the apex of what made the original so good yet also bad.","March 8","true","10.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DodgerBL/recommended/274170/","DodgerBL","Dodger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DodgerBL/","309 products in account","Honestly, compared to it's predecessor, Hotline Miami 2 keeps a lot of the same elements, such as the dynamic and awesome OST, the visuals, and basic gameplay elements. The story is in vein of the last game, however, this game still distinguishes itself. The gameplay difficulty has a singificant rampup from the previous, so even the most hardened players will have some challenge in mastering this game, and certain levels will definitely put a grip on your testicles (or ovaries, in case I'm being unfair). New powers such as a roll and a mask that creates 2 players allows you to change up the flow of the game. The OST is also more intense and even arguably better than the original Hotline Miami, which suits the cranking up the intensity of the game. If you loved Hotline Miami 1, this game will be everything you hoped for and more. Features that I have not yet even used like the level editior are sure to add to the replay value of the game too.\n\nIf you are deciding between the 2 games now, I'd say go for Hotline Miami 1 then get Hotline Miami 2 later, due to the fact that Hotline Miami is a tad easier and helps set up the mood for the sequel. I will probably update this review when I progress farther in the game (finished the first 2 axts so far).","March 10, 2015","true","7.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Remember how you could tell Jacket and the Hooker were growing closer by seeing Jacket’s apartment? (The place got cleaned up, she first slept on the couch, then in a bed that was next to Jacket’s bed, and finally the two beds were pushed together) ♥♥♥♥ that. Everything is now in your face. For example, hallucinations. In HM1 they were an interesting look into the psyche of Jacket. In HM2 the tone you get from them is now "oOooOOoo you’re going to die ooOOoOoo spooky!”, they’re flat out a supernatural ghost vision of the future that everybody gets.\n-Almost every single character was bland and uninteresting. And those who are get dropped right out of the story as soon as they appear! (e.g. Fans, Martin) And the way it just abruptly ends makes you feel like you've been cheated.\n\nI mean, sure, Hotline Miami doesn't really focus on the story, but the subtle way it was told in HM1 just blows HM2 out of the water.\n\nWhat's that you say? You play Hotline Miami for the gameplay, not the story? That’s sure to be good right?\n\nGameplay: 4/10\n-You liked the fast paced action of HM1? I’ve got bad news for you. HM2 actually makes you slow down.\n-Level design has taken a major nosedive in quality. Just like the story, ha ha\n-Because every level is ♥♥♥♥ing huge and open, your strategy for 90% of the time in HM2 is to find cover, bait enemy to come to you -> kill -> repeat. No more massacring everybody in seconds or variations on how to clear a room. In later levels you are practically forced to do this strategy.\n-Get ready for unseen enemies to shoot and kill you even when you use shift to look ahead.\n-An overabundance of windows and long corridors make for bad and unfun times.\n-Every single Hawaii level after the first will give you a headache. What do you mean I can’t pick up guns? You ran out of ammo and there isn't an ammo box? Tough luck, that fat guy is gonna rip your heart out.\n-I can honestly say I only had fun playing the Fans and Richter’s levels, they really captured the feel from HM1 in those (except for the prison, which was just a mess)\n-Gameplay doesn’t match up with the fast paced music most of the time, because of the baiting strategy\n\nTldr; don’t buy it unless you’re a fan of Hotline Miami 1 and willing to overlook the massive drop in quality from 1.","March 11, 2015","false","33.0"," 59 of 114 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","59","114","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gopnicktothepower/recommended/274170/","gopnicktothepower","Davion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gopnicktothepower/","160 products in account","WARNING : This game will make you hate dogs , fat people , samurais and windows .\n\nI said Hotline Miami was a piece of art .\n\nAnd holy ♥♥♥♥ , Hotline Miami 2 was a blast as well .\n\nLet's start with the most essential point :\n\nGAMEPLAY\nBasically the same mechanics as the first episode , mostly .\nThe difference comes from the variety of characters you have . Among them : A soldier who chooses a main weapon between five ; the fans , who each have a unique skill (which are all useful as long as you're not awful in this game . Yeah , sorry , fan haters) ...\nOne interesting addition is the writer , with his non-lethal style , where you only have to knock off the ennemies , either with bare hands or with melee swing . Picking up ennemy guns will make the character empty the weapon , leaving it unusable so no ennemy can pick it up .\nAs before , you have the choice between melee and weapons , BUT some ennemies will require you to switch of style . Remember those fat guys only vulnerable to bullets ? Now there is -in extremely rare occasions though- ennemies who only dies from melee attacks , somehow dodging bullets . The lovely dogs are still here too . The devs knew you wanted them . One issue with the melee system , however , is the executions . They take quite much more time than in the previous game , and supposing you don't finish an ennemy the moment after you killed another , your combo will be broken , so you better be sure all your swings are lethal and that you don't abuse doors too much .\nBut going fully melee isn't recommended anyway , giving the enormous floors . You WILL have to use guns sometime .  Remember the Assault level in the first game ? Well there are several levels this big in HM2 . Full of windows that allows the ennemies to see you and shoot you dead before you can say FU** .\nWhich brings another point : The difficulty .\nSo far , I've only cleared the game on Normal difficulty . And god , it makes HM1 look like a tutorial episode .\nThis game is pure Trial & Error . You're going to need skill , level knowledge and both patience and nerves to get through the game . Because holy ♥♥♥♥ , Hotline Miami 2 does NOT fogive mistakes . But that's part of the game . The feeling of satisfaction after completing a level is that great .\nSo , maybe there are different mechanics , but that's part of the work ! When you want a sequel , you want something different , not just a refresh , right ? It's not that the level design is poor . It's purposely made to make you try again and again , until you can clear the perfect run .\nEspecially if you go for the A+/S rank in each level .\n\n\n\nSCENARIO\nI don't know where to begin . It's both satisfying and disapointing . Just by the way it ended .\nIt's not a focus about one character we have , but around many , quite like the everyday life of an apocalyptic Miami threatened by the conflict between 50 blessings and the Russian mafia , after the traumatism caused by Jacket's actions , that more or less started it all . The storyline happens to be way more tragic than the first episode (Just look at the contrast between HM1 and HM2's menu theme) and  DO NOT ATTACH TO CHARACTERS . You're warned .  .\nThere is a lot of new characters and story arcs , which or all more or less connected , and all related to Jacket in some way . The latter is not playable , but you're going to hear about him .\nThe backstory is complete , mostly with little elements this and there (the dates and the journals) that might confuse the player who didn't look for them before the ending .\nLast point for the scenario part :\nThe ending was pretty disapointing , particularly because it happens right after a very well-thought finale . I mean , come on , there was better than just that .\nWell at least they said the conclusion would be brutal and they didn't lie . And the fake teaser at the end proved the ending . But it's just ... mean .\n\n\n\nSOUNDTRACK\n\nHoly mother of Jesus . I didn't know till there that ears could have an erection . It's no less than 49 tracks in there , for the pure pleasure of your ears , and each level plays a different one , unlike the first Hotline Miami . 30 artists joined this massive ear candy made of electro , with some veterans of the first such as M|O|O|N , Jasper Byrne , Perturbator and El Huervo . You'd guess , as I'm writing all of this , I'm still listening to the OST . I don't really have words for it , they wouldn't be able to represent the greatness of those sounds .\n\n\n\nI do believe the main points have all been exposed . There are a few cons to the game though - even though minor ones. Some bugs involving doors , where some ennemies will happen to get stuck and have ... what seems to be a seizure , I don't know . There has been report of dogs going through walls , but it didn't happened to me .  however the unarmed prisonners managed to jump on me , completely ignoring the doors , quite a lot of time . Truely irritating considering this level is already hell .\nThe IA is still like before , with some ennemies stopping to chase you after a certain point  well god thanks that allows the player to breath sometimes  .\n\n\nOverall , Hotline Miami 2 is an over-the-top game , and strongly recommended for those who loved Hotline Miami 1 . Why not to newbies ? Because they should first play Hotline Miami 1 , so they can understand the context , and be trained for what is going to be a hard , hard trip .\nYes , there were some changes , without completely metamorphozing the game mechanics , but that's what make it a whole new episode rather than an extension . There were answers , there was a completion and explanation to HM1's events , there was a solid gameplay , an insane difficulty and a lot of pixelated blood : All the elements that makes a Hotline Miami .","March 12, 2015","true","56.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

If you've played the classic GTAs, you'll be quite familiar with this. Unlike GTA, the game isn't so much open world as it is mission to mission. You'll be brutally gunning down or beating up your enemies. But it's not quite as simple as holding down a trigger and win. The game is challenging where all it takes is one shot to end your game.\n\nHotline Miami's visual is of some of the best I've seen in pixel art. It's similar to what you might of seen from the 16 bit era, but refined to great detail. The game is brutal, violent, and gory, and it takes a lot of skill to represent that degree of grotesque in 16 bits, as the resolution doesn't leave the artist much room for error. The visuals are vibrant and all cohesively themed in an 80s retro style. It's gorgeous! The audio is of an equal quality with one of the best OST in recent memory.\n\nThough a game like this, that feel quite arcady, can often get away with little to no story. Hotline Miami 2 takes the high road and offers an engrossing narrative that goes much deeper than a simple crime drama. With out spoilers, it goes into the delusional, and I'd compare it to the psychological thriller genre. But do be aware, it also explores some extremely dark and adult themes. This is not a game for children or those who are easily offended.\n\nThere's much to love about Hotline Miami 2, but it doesn't get away with out flaws that's worth pointing out. The game does have some bugs, not many, but some and when they appear, they're noticeable. Also the enemy AI, though passable, could be improved on, as they're not always reacting realistically.\n\nOverall, Hotline Miami 2 is a great game that's worth every penny it's asking for. It's challenging, looks and sounds amazing, and brutally honest in it's story telling. I can not recommend this any more!\n\nPros:\n- Great visuals and audio\n- Challenging and skillful gameplay\n- Engrossing story\n- Varied player classes to mix things up\n- Addictive and satisfying\n\nCons\n- Some bugs\n- AI can react unrealistically at times","March 11, 2015","true","6.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/towwl/recommended/274170/","towwl","towwl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/towwl/","234 products in account","SIKE, THAT’S THE WRONG NUMBER\n\nAlright, now that I’ve referenced the meme everybody else who’s played this game has, it’s time for me to ramble about a game that I love. Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number is the second title in the Hotline Miami series, and it is hella tight.\n\nIt’s a top down kill ‘em up where you enter a building, kill everybody, then leave. What makes it “unique” is how every enemy dies in one hit, as does yourself. However, dying in Hotline Miami isn’t something to be afraid of as you can just hit that R button to retry in an instant.\n\nBecause of the whole “nobody has any health” thing, it makes the whole game fast paced. Each moment leads into the next on what you’re going to have to do to make everybody but yourself die, planning out each step right in the moment. It’s almost a puzzle game with top-down shooter elements.\n\nThe story itself is actually really well written and aligns very nicely with HM1. It’s told in a nonlinear fashion similar to that of Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction and Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse Five. And for people who don’t really care for it, it’s easy to just skim over it and get right back into the game.\n\nThe hard mode in the game is actually a real “hard mode”, where the enemies are smarter and the levels are altered just right to make them brutal compared to their normal mode counterparts.\n\nHowever, there are a few issues that hard mode highlights in the game. This review is may be a thumbs up, but I’m going to go over what this game got wrong because that’s easier to do than what the game got right.\n\nThe first thing I noticed when playing this game was its slower than the original. At first I thought it was just the slower executions, leaving you vulnerable for longer periods of time when dealing with downed enemies, but it was more than that.\n\nThis game features a great deal more of open areas than its predecessor did, leaving you in a lot of situations where you just get shot by enemies that are off the screen as they can see farther than you can. This makes the game a bit more cautious, and as a result making it slower. Walking around in these big open spaces is a lot scarier than it was in HM1, rather than blazing your way through tightly made levels like in the first.\n\nAlso, with bigger rooms comes greater numbers of enemies. A lot of the difficulty in this game comes from just packing the level full of enemies for you to deal with. This combined with the larger areas makes it pretty scary to walk around in open hallways.\n\nNot to mention the high number of windows as well. Windows in this game are basically just walls that can be seen through, as well as shot through. With so little walls to hide behind, you’re just begging to be shot in these levels.\n\nThere’s also a lot more gunplay rather than melee. With open areas with lots of enemies who also have guns that can see you through most of the level, there’s pretty much nothing you can use but guns. Especially with the big guys that come at you that can only be killed by bullet. Sure there’s the melee enemies that are able to dodge bullets, but those are used to sparingly compared to the big guys and really tips the scale to mostly using guns rather than melee, which is really what set the pace for HM1.\n\nThis kind of level design in the game slowed it down to just hiding behind corners with a machine gun in hand, plowing down all the idiot AIs that come around to add themselves to the massive pile of bodies.\n\nAnother separate issue, which wasn’t a big problem for me as I never really played with masks in HM1, but there was way less mask variety in this game than in the last. Since you played as characters rather than just Jacket with all this masks (the main character in HM1), you had way less choice in what specialties you had when entering a level. I’m sure for a lot of people this was a heavy hitter, but I personally didn’t mind.\n\nThe game’s difficulty is on a whole new level than what HM1 was. HM1’s difficulty is very gradual throughout the entire game, going through the entire spectrum of easy to hard, but this game starts off difficulty wise a little more than halfway through HM1’s difficulty, and it’s likely due to those slowing level design choices. I didn’t find that too particularly bad since I played the crap outta HM1, but for any newcomers it could be off putting.\n\nA smaller gripe would be that the soundtrack didn’t really do it for me. HM1 had a lot of songs that stuck with me as favorites which led me to actually buy to music to listen to on the go, but none of the songs really stuck out for me in HM2 for listening to outside of the game. After my first playthrough of the story I muted the music and listened to my own stuff, HM1 soundtrack included.\n\nAside from that, the game is amazing. Just by simply being another Hotline Miami game, it more than enough makes up for the poor design choices. If I were to give the game a letter grade, I’d give it an A-. Enough for me to dedicate way too much time into score/time attacking, not to mention the level editor that’s to come out soon which I’ll probably play for only a few hundred hours.\n\nShould you buy the game? If you’re new to the series I’d suggest starting out with the first game, really just because it’s easier and it introduces you to the Hotline Miami world. HM2 started off as a mod for HM1, later made into a standalone experience, so it was made from the ground up to be played by people who’ve already dipped their toes into the series. If you’ve already played HM1 and liked it, great! You’re going to love HM2, as it’s really just an expansion on what HM1 was.\n\ntl;dr:\n\nIt’s Hotline Miami, just with more Hotline Miami. If you liked the first one, you’ll likely be a fan of Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number.","March 16, 2015","true","21.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

Some characters don't even have 'em.\n- Adding onto that, restrictive gameplay. Late game is ranged central. Melee may as well not exist from Act 4 and upwards. Remember that pacifist character I mentioned? In order to beat a Hard Mode level as him, you have to go against that mechanic.\n- Atrocious AI\n- Windows are no ones enemy, it's how they're centered around almost all the ' difficult ' aspects of this games challenging demeanor that makes them such a toxic mechanic.\n- Doors are practically a bug altogether.\n\nDo I recommend this game to people who like/are interested in Hotline Miami, and wanna get more into it story AND gameplay wise? Yeah, man.\n\nDo I recommend this game to people who want a similar experience to Hotline Miami 1? Who want to ♥♥♥♥♥ it out, get all their achievements and do everything there is to do? No. Get it while it's on sale or something.\n\nStarting off, I have Achievement ♥♥♥♥♥'d both games. I've done all there is to do, and I've seen it all. I've sat for hours on end, getting my A+'s. I've grinded the kills for Genocide. I've felt the relief of walking into that golden, rainbow pathed gate at the end of Hard Mode Apocalypse. And I wish I could say I regret all of it, because the more time I put into this game, the more I hated it.\n\nBefore Act 3, the game actually has great level design. Moving Up is one of my personal favorites, and there isn't really any other level like it. There seems to be an ebb and flow to all of it, until you hit Dead Ahead. This is where you're introduced to the sloppily thought out room design, annoying enemy rotations, frustrating window placement and clunky AI.\n\nYes, it's kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to constantly compare the sequel to it's shorter predecessor, but it's kind of important to my reasoning. Hotline Miami 1 was short and sweet. The difficulty left you blaming yourself, and it felt good to learn from your mistakes. You could rush in, and be done in no time at all-- Because you learned the area, you got comfortable with your actions, and learned from your previous ones. Hotline Miami 2 was an RNG-based bait fest, filled with intentionally placed windows that completely throw you off your groove and result in yet another frustratin off-screen or sudden death.\n\nThe magic of Hotline Miami 1 was how much it could afflict a player within it's short, action-packed levels. Hotline Miami 2 just wants to see how long it can drag its fingernails across the chalkboard of a droned out, lengthy level filled with lengthy boards that want you to play by it's rules. Every level in the sequel is like a puzzle that you can only solve one way, and one way only-- Through means of large enemies, dogs, unique enemies and windows. This becomes very apparent in Hard Mode.\n\nAgain, this is a good game. It's just... kind'a lazily made. I doubt I'll return to it for level editor, as I've had my fair enough share of blood and neon. I'm not gonna give it a rating, because it's sorta different for everyone. I'll repeat, if you want a new experience and are overall new to Hotline Miami, go for it. If you're a veteran who craves more, wait for the fanmade mods Midnight Animal and Hotline Miami:Redial to quench your thirst for combo's and anger.","January 7","false","42.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

People claim that this game has awful level design, but you can gather from the way the levels are designed that this game favors much more smart movement and baiting the enemies than Hotline Miami 1, which isn't a bad thing at all. Going through a stage using your weapons effectively just gives you a much bigger satisfaction when you reach the end and listen to the magnificent track "M.O.O.N - Dust" and see the score rack up.\n\nThe way the plot of the game is revealed is marvelous, you play as several people around the time before and after the events caused by Jacket and the janitors in Hotline Miami 1, every one of the characters gets its ending and the overall plot just ends on quite a surprise, you should go finih the game and see it, it's awesome.\n\nAnd what can I say about the graphics and soundtrack? Both are awesome, with the game showing much mora violence than it's predecessor and with an OST comprising of 50 musics that pump you full of adrenaline in each level. You just can't stop yourself from humming the theme for each level after several retries.","March 11, 2015","true","9.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

It is the first game that compelled me to tell others how fantastic it is, and the reason I started my Lets Play channel. In the past year, some clever marketing by Devolver Digital has revved up the anticipation for Hotline Miami 2 beyond belief. It went from a nicely polished but largely unknown gorefest to a game nearing “mainstream” success while retaining the edge that is quite literally shaping the series. The game wasn’t just carried by marketing of course, the slick controls serve the top-down shooter/stealth/brawler hybrid extremely well. As I danced my way through the stages, I found myself painting like Pollock, on every inch of screen available. Punch a guy in the head, use his gun until it’s spent, fling said gun through a window and kill another dude with it. Glorious. Dance the dance of death with me while I dig a little deeper into Hotline Miami 2.\n\nThe best part about both games is undoubtedly the music. I could write for days on how well the pulsing synth and kicking bass positively accentuates the glorious neon frenzy that is unfolding on the screen. Aside from fantastic electro, Hotline Miami 2 features a number of ambient tracks during the dialogue scenes. The ambient music is generally rather eerie, and while I don’t particularly enjoy them as much as some of the more banging tracks, they do serve the aesthetic of a mask-wearing psychopath extremely well. The level of detail in this game is as impressive as ever too. My mind was absolutely blown when I walked by a rack of clothing and it spun as I brushed by it. It doesn’t affect anything about the gameplay, it’s purely meant to immerse you deeper and such small details carry the game a very long way in that regard.\n\nThe original Hotline Miami offered masks which had a variety of effects from augmenting your walking speed to spawning you with a weapon. Hotline Miami 2 takes this mechanic to a whole new extreme with a massive load of new masks and abilities. Some do seem a bit gimmicky, such the twin swans who operate as a unit, but overall the slew of new masks to pick from is extremely satisfying. Some masks are inherently better than others, but that was also true in the original game. Then again, what is inherently better for a character who enjoys brawling might not suit a player who prefers an old-fashioned shooting rampage. This freedom is what defined the original Hotline Miami, and unfortunately some of that was stripped away in the sequel. When playing as the swans you aren’t able to pick up any new weapons. Ammo can only be found in specified crates, and this castrates much of the freedom the original offered.\n\nWhile the gimmicks involved with a few of the masks seems to be a poor choice, there is very little else to nitpick about this game. Some of the sound effects are a bit generic or repetitive, and the fun factor is knocked down a bit due to the frustrating difficulty. Overall Hotline Miami 2 is a blast to play and will keep me coming back to try and top the global scoreboard for a long time to come. The actual gameplay feels a lot less luck-based than the original installment. The storyline is also much more gripping this time around, though it does Tarantino around an awful lot. There is some controversy over a ♥♥♥♥ scene that appears in the game, but after stomping a series of five bad guy’s heads like grapes in an old I Love Lucy episode, I didn’t find myself overly phased by it. The entire game is a trip, and one totally worth experience.

You'll be prevented to do that here as the game is heavily bugged and very often you'll get stuck in doors and corners,causing you an insta-death by enemies' hands.\n\n2) The game came up TOO WAY early because of Payday2 Hype Train and MANY MANY bugs still haven't been fixed; the game itself crashed for no reason and came out without any achievements; also...in the first 3 days HM2 had like 15 updates used to fix major issues ---> BAD PARENTING FROM DEVELOPERS\n\n3) The game should have been released with the level editor included. I don't see anything here.\n\n4) Controls are ♥♥♥♥ed up as they're woody and slow; i've already mentioned that you'll often get stuck into doors or small wall holes...but even if you don't get stuck...you'll loose 1-2 seconds everytime just to get into rooms just because the game itself doesn't help your charachter into passing into the right path.\n\n5) The story ruins the game mechanics ; the plot is not showed in a chronological order and you'll have to switch from different charachters from a different time window everytime. On the long period can be QUITE puzzling; i had to check a guide to understand the whole story of HM1 and HM2.\n\n6) Masks and Masks' Skills : they're quite terrible and moronic. Just few examples:\n\na : chainsaw brothers : one brother has a chainsaw ( OP as F**K) and the other one holds a gun...problem is...aiming with the other brother is a pain in the ♥♥♥!!! Loosing time aiming will lead you to death most of the time\n\nb : Mafia Boss' Son  abilities : they just copy-pasted other abilities that the previous charachters had. Devs were too lazy to come up with something better / more creative\n\nc : Soldier : he can start with 40 ammo rounds,but after he picks ammo from ammo crates after u've ran out of them...his ammo capacity will be halved. W-H-Y? That makes no sense.\n\n7) Enemies : no innovations from the previous one,except for the crazy prisoners.\n\n8) Bugged enemies : sometimes they won't charge you when you're next to them,sometimes they will chase you to the South Pole. You're able to kill enemies from closed doors,windows and WALLS punching them. YEAH .\n\n9) Weapons : the numeber of melee and long range weapons that tou can use has been dramatically decreased,lowering levels' variety.

Dont expect grade A++ stuff from sequels though being it IS a sequel after all and it IS gonna be "meh" game. At the moment everyones bickering of how the same it is to the first one and i can disagree with them, the plot takes place years after the first hotline miami where if you look at the digital comics..you will know, dont want to give backstory in this review. but we are in 1991 where things have changed and gotten worse. the gameplay is equally the same but adding new tweaks like reloading for some characters and using one button for the chainsaw and gun. the visuals are the same bloody gory pixelated goodness like the first, but adding more visuals to the death animations, bodies.etc note the game is has more cutscenes than action and honestly i like that. the music is fantastic as always from hlm 1 and give the game some good atmosphere imo. at the time now the editor is NOT released NOT RELEASED (if you're reading this in the future then its already out) and if you are wanting the game for it, wait till spring 2015 for it, there will be workshop.\n\nin my humble opinion hotline miami 2: wrong number is just starting out...stop picking at it like its the worst game on steam >.<\n\ni would rate this game a 10\9.5","March 10, 2015","true","29.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombologist83/recommended/274170/","zombologist83","AmericanSmeagol","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombologist83/","213 products in account","One of the first things I noticed about Hotline Miami 2 was that its soundtrack felt slower to me, more cinematic and larger in scope. I think that best encapsulates HLM2: larger in scope. A lot about this game won't make sense on your first play through, you will curse frequently and the playstyle you were used to is no longer effective in this game. Still, this game builds on what made the first one great and offers a ton more replayability for those who want it.\n\nMoving on to level design, because this is a controversial talking point for this game, I am ambivalent. Hotline 1 feels claustrophobic compared to this game. There is a lot more space to run and maneuver, which becomes important the more that gunplay gets involved. Because practically every enemy has guns, levels are no longer small hallways. There is a lot more happening in the background now too. You'll notice it most in the second scene, but it's present all over the game. Set pieces that tip over or rotate as you move past them. You'll also notice A TON OF WINDOWS have now been added to the game. I personally found some levels to be extremely frustrating, but I also learned more about how the game works (like using windows to my advantage). As someone who appreciates a game that teaches players, I ultimately enjoyed this aspect.\n\nThey've stopped that annoying camera bobbing thing that made 1 feel like it was floating in a pool of water, but they didn't pull the camera back. Because so many enemies with guns appear off screen, you will frequently die from bullets shot by guns you can't see. That means mastering, or becoming familiar with, shift looking is crucial. Failure to shift look will extend your play time by several excruciating hours. Stop resisting shift look because you can snipe with pistols from across the map.\n\nThis is a game built for perfectionists and speedrunners. That unforgiving difficulty is why NES games like Ninja Gaiden live on in our hearts. It's not about finishing the level, anyone can do that with a simple game of peek-a-boo as has been pointed out on these forums. It's about discovering methods to lure and murder in groups. Combos are so much more effective (and harder to get) in this game, and boldness and flexibility scores actually matter. This game, when played at a high level, is all about speed and flexibility. You can dodge bullets now, something that was virtually impossible in part one.\n\nI have come to the realization that the story is like an homage to Drive. If you've ever seen that movie, it's easy to find yourself left with a lot of questions about the characters you just met. Much like in HLM1, where the world is not quite what it seems. For instance, the community has yet to come to a consensus on how much of HLM1 happened in Jacket's real life and how much was a coma dream. There are two stories happening here: what you actually see and how it fits into the scope of the Hotline Miami timeline. The latter is what makes the story rewarding, because the former is quite jumbled and in some cases very abrupt.\n\nThose who want to replay a game and learn it will find the experience of Hotline Miami 2 to be a frustrating climb to a satisfying top. Those expecting a fun and twitchy murder simulator that lasts for a few hours might find themselves disappointed by this experience.\n\nAsk yourself which of these gamers you are before you buy this game.\n\n[[*Edit: A note on hard mode. I thought it was too hard, like suck the fun out of the game hard. I'll probably finish it because I'm kind of a super fan of this game, but I am not enjoying that part at all.]]","March 18, 2015","true","121.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkhairedwarrior/recommended/274170/","darkhairedwarrior","Potato-chan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkhairedwarrior/","71 products in account","The first half of this review contains no spoilers the second will, I will warn you when the spoiler part starts.\nSo firstly my thoughts: I first bought and played Hotline Miami a couple months ago and completely fell in love with it, the graphics were perfect, the music a big bonus, the controls were simple for anyone to learn it and the difficulty hard like it should be and with Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number they get all this right again and improved on the story aspect making it 10 times as good as the first in my mind, the new weapons blend in nicely, but I normally used the original shotgun when I could. This game reminded me of the biker missions in the way that every character is different in some way, e.g. the cop seemed more like Jacket, but his friend who I nicked name the pacifist only used blunt weapons to knock out opponents which made fighting anyone with a gun a problem (My least favourite moments). The difficulty has increased for sure in this game, in the first game I made it through levels dying once or twice and in the first level I died over and over reminding me of playing some of the last levels in the Jacket missions for the first time. I loved all the missions with Tony and the mask gang they were very fun with all the different masks, my favourite being the twins.\nNow spoilers ahead since this is the part where I review the story.\nOn a story stand point this game is great, it tells a detailed story from many characters, but sometimes I wanted to learn more about certain characters like what happened to Jacket, I understand he went to jail and all but maybe a bit more information would have been nice. Other than that I quite liked it, the writer was found out more about the guy you kill as Jacket in the mission assault and I like that we see the stories of the different people from the original game, like the guy who you see in a couple of places in the Jacket story and how he was in Afghanistan, or that one fat guy you see shaving his head in the bathroom in one of the times you go into the bar in the first game. The amount of unexpected things in this game were crazy, one of my favourite missions has to be the final one Apocalypse was very fun and showed the head of the Russian mod killing all of the mask gang, I did like how they showed the different abilities they had, like with the twins, one head moved towards you attacking you with the chainsaw but looking like a head, the other trying to stay away shooting at you. The ending was perfect for this game, with the nukes going off and everyone dying, or did they because the final thing that happens which sort of annoyed me was the sneaky little thing they did hinting at a third game by putting you in the title screen of Hotline Miami 3 and then a couple seconds later rewinding and going back to Hotline Miami 2 title screen which I also found entertaining.\nSo what I thought, with everything said above I will give this game a 9/10 this game did very well to show what it wanted to show, but I just wanted more story about Jacket, other than that the story had some faults killing off a lot of characters before we learnt more about why they do what they did and I found that a bit sad.\n","March 22, 2015","true","50.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It's almost like the developers said, “The sequel should be bigger and better, like Hotline Miami 1 with more variety and complexity.” While they delivered on that idea through the plot, music, and characters, they failed to provide really concise level design.\nLevels were smaller in Hotline Miami 1 so that you could predict what would happen with any given action. This made the one-hit-kill-one-hit-death gimmick work, because instead of having a health advantage over your enemies, you had a “situational awareness” advantage.\nThis advantage is drastically affected by the size and scope of Hotline Miami 2’s levels. Levels are much larger compared to Hotline Miami 1. In Hotline Miami 1 there were more situations where if you came out of cover, an enemy would mostly likely see you, but since the levels were more compact, you always knew that they would see you. In Hotline Miami 2, however, determining whether or not the enemy sees you is more dependent on how long their line-of-sight is. This is accentuated by the fact that enemies tend to come rushing from off-screen before you get your bearings.\nThe majority of levels in Hotline Miami 2 play like the “Exposed” stage in Hotline Miami 1. Big, open, and a bit unmanageable.\n\nDespite this, Hotline Miami 2 is a good experience and you should get it.

Hotline Miami 2 features longer levels and a greater focus on narrative, allowing the game's normal run of 26 levels to feel quite meaty. Take caution, however; the sequel will force you to adapt to new gameplay styles and situatiuons as the story jumps back and forth like children playing hopscotch. You may be comfortable playing Corey or Detective Pardo in the first two levels, only to find that Jake has a minuscule reach with his fists.\n\nThe biggest detraction to gamelay is the combination of oversized maps, long hallways, and the increased tendency of your enemies to be packing firearms. By themselves, these three points aren't enough to be a problem; together, they combine to make some of the levels ridiculously difficult. Some other nuances of level design are questionable, such as the cargo hold of the ship with a door that can hinder your own gunfire. I also thought that locating the ammo boxes in the Hawaii missions to be a chore, especially when you must take down heavy enemy soldiers with your gun as opposed to the knife.\n\nIf you can swallow the pill of artificial difficulty that pervades some of the later stages, Hotline Miami 2 is a musical and visual treat that is to be savored. It successfully captures the elements of the first game without being a direct rehash.","March 11, 2015","true","25.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Where do I start?\n\nIt's different than the first one. Very different. For starters, you don't control just one guy. There are different guys with different abilities. And I don't mean masks like in the first game. Sure, there are different masks still, but you have a set of different people that have different abilities. Some of them can't pick up weapons other than what they already have. Some of them can only use certain weapons.\n\nThe retro style of the graphics and soundtrack really give the game a nostalgic feel. While on the topic, the soundtrack is even better than in the first game, and that's saying something.\n\nThe gory kills are just as awesome as ever, perhaps even better.

It has more tracks than the first game did by a long shot, and to top it all off they're all just as good. I'll probably end up buying it soon.\n\nOne of the replayability factors for this one comes from Hard Mode, which unlocks when you complete the normal mode of the game. It makes EVERYTHING worse. The enemies have better aim, reaction time, there are more of the 'big' enemies that you have to shoot in order to kill.\n\nAnother thing that makes hardmode harder is that when you hold shift to look further, you have to aim in the opposite direction, so you can't use it to easily shoot people who are off-screen. Oh, no lock-on either. Did I mention no lock-on?\n\nOverall I'd definitely recommend buying this game if you enjoyed the first one or if you're looking for a challenge.

Violent and full of black humor. Whatever Hotline Miami 2 is, one thing is certain: It is fun. Acting as a VHS tape fever dream of a prequel and sequel, Wrong Number sometimes bites off more than it can chew when it comes to its abundant characters and how they fit into the scheme of things.\n\nThe VHS framing device and its large cast somehow manage to make this feel more like a "traditional game", whereas the first was more of a mesmerizing, violent dream that was more art than game at points. The decison to no longer focus on Jacket may alienate a small group of fans. This game is more about inhabiting this awful worlds head space.\n\nThe sound track is what you would hope for in a sequel. It helps to mesmerize the player into its bleak and apocalyptic world, only offering brief moments of emotional reprieve.

It's definitely an upgrade from the first game and does mostly everything better than the first. The game does indeed have its flaws though. The levels can be very large at times and if you're not careful you'll find yourself getting shot from off-screen. If you haven't played the first game then you'll probably be confused about a lot of things when it comes to the story. As for the pros, the story is smartly written and reminds me of the movie Pulp Fiction. The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in a videogame for a while. Of course I'm biased since I've loved both installments of the series but if you haven't played this game or its predecessor, you should definitely play them at the very least.","April 18, 2015","true","64.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerohakaru/recommended/274170/","zerohakaru","Darling","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerohakaru/","282 products in account","So, I just marathoned both HM1 and 2 (as I was late to the party with 1, got intrigued by it through Payday 2 blah blah...). Anyway, after beating both and sitting on my thoughts, I felt that I had to review them. Particularly this one.\n\nHotline Miami 2 is trying to both emulate Hotline Miami 1's successes" while trying to be its own separate beast. Key word there is trying.\n\nGameplay\nFirst and foremost, Hotline Miami is known for unapologetic, hyper violence. The first was fast-paced and thrill seeking. The second... not so much.\n\nLevels\n\nAs many of the reviews hovering around have mentioned, the levels are huge in comparison to HM1. The sheer size of many maps is probably an attempt to make the stakes that much higher than 1's. Throw in about triple the amount of gunners, glass windows, and fatguys compared to the first, rushing in with nothing but a baseball bat seems like an awful idea. Enemies are ready to snipe you from a good distance away from your vision, even when shift-looking. The AI is a bit more unpredictable and I've seen players restart constantly just to get the ideal set-up to get the max rank on the level.\n\nBecause of these behaviors, the challenge is ramped up yet there is more emphasis on slower, precision gunplay or clever melee baiting tricks over running in like a maniac clubbing fools. It's not really a bad thing, but it quite feel right when compared to 1.\n\nAs its own thing however, it is not bad in the slightest. After getting used to the new "rules" of the game, I started to adapt and find myself analyzing the situation for an ideal course of action. Then I'd apply trial and error until I got GO TO CAR.\n\nCharacter Mechanics\n\nReplacing the mask mechanic from 1, we now have multiple characters to play with that have unique abilities save for a couple of duds.\nThe Fans, Jake, and The Son emulate a more active version of 1's mask system. This time, many of the characters have abilities like dodge rolling or playing a murderous verison of Super Smash Bros' Ice Climbers. A step up from "start with knife." The weak point is that The Son basically is a carbon copy of 3 of the The Fans.\n\nThe character Evan has unique rules where you can either play non-lethally (more rewarding point wise) or go into a blood rage. His type of playstyle fits better with the methodical take I mentioned earlier.\n\nBeard has mixed reception. You basically pick 1 type of gun in the beginning of his levels and are stuck with it for the rest of the level. Ammo can be found but in remote locations and you can switch to the knife. I myself didn't mind his levels as much. I liked the idea of 1 weapon only challenges, but I can see how this type of play is a turn off to some.\n\nPardo (he's supposed to be better with guns... all I noticed were gun executions), Richter, Martin, and the Henchman are basically like playing with the Richard mask, except with the big levels. Richter's level are pretty well-designed for the most part. Pardo was the biggest offender.\nIn short, the gameplay still has its ultraviolent nature from the first, it's just the approach to handling the challenge is a different experience than HM1. Beating a level is still a triumphant feeling.\n\nStory\nHotline Miami 1 barely had a real story to it. There were teases to background info of a narrative but it was never really the intent of 1 to tell a story. Hotline Miami 2, however, tries to tell a story... well, multiple stories to varying degrees of success.\n\nEach character has a story arc that tells their history of what is going on in the mid 80's to early 90's. Without spoiling actual plot, some of these stories intersect to show how the events lead to the finale... as well as one or two really having no point in existing at all.\n\nThe problem with the story-telling feels like a conflict of trying to be a symbolic, interpretive art piece while also trying to be an actual narrative but never really commits to either. While there is nothing wrong with a piece that is left to interpretation... the problem is that while the lead up adheres to that rule, the climax and finale do not.\n\nIn the ways of being a narrative, we get teases of how events are set up, especially with the possible origin of 50 Blessings,the fate of Jacket, the relationship between America and Russia, etc. However, these threads go nowhere, which, ironically, is a central theme to the story lines.\n\nInevitability of the end is the overall theme of the story and, while the build up with scenes constructed around it are well done, the pay off is rather disappointing and almost rushed. No, really, you get to the climax and "first ending" of the game halfway through as one side of the story and then finish it up again on the other side. Shortly after that, you get the second ending to tie up the remaining loose ends, mostly poorly. At the end, you're left with literally nothing.\n\nWhile I'm not asking for a full-fledged epic, the minimalist story telling HM1 did attempt worked well to get fans to think and could've continued into HM2 while building upon its twisted world. The game's environments along with the short bits of dialogue told a story. There was fun in piecing the deeper tidbits together in HM1. HM2 doesn't do that. Everything is given to you pretty much up front when dealing with the immediate plot to leave nothing to interpretation. When it comes to the burning questions of the story, they are merely brushed upon and never given satisifying payoffs, especially what, at the moment, is the last official Hotline Miami game.\n\nTo summarize: HM2 feels like it is on to something with the stronger points of the story only to just give up on it and flat out say "don't worry, there's no point, the end" at the end as some sort of deeper meaning. Granted, story is not the main appeal to the Hotline Miami series but it had the makings of something intriguing to explore.\n\nGraphics and Sound\n\nMerging these together, there isn't much to say. You still have your colorful retro graphics and amazing soundtrack. These two followed the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" mantra.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo, it sounds more negative here than positive. Why do I still recommend Hotline Miami 2? Because it is not a bad game when compared to the first. It's better to describe it as a game with a different meta (god, I hate that term, but it fits). I still got hours of enjoyment out of it and I am looking forward to improving my awful scores of my first run.\n\nThe game itself was an ambitious attempt to do more than HM1, but I believe the idea of finality got to deeply engrained into the development rather than work towards slowly building up to something fantastic. As of writing this review, we still wait for what the level editor will add to the experience which I do look forward to.\n\nHotline Miami 2 is a good game that doesn't quite match up to the original. You'll still enjoy it but don't expect it to be better than the first as many reviews state. It is the 8/10 to Hotline Miami's 9/10.","April 12, 2015","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Better music by far, 50 tracks of non stop rad music. Better variety in enviroments, most areas in the game look completely different than the previous.\n\nNow here's the big issue, the story is absolutely convulted. On purpose i'm sure but the story features a playable cast of characters who well.. they're just pointlessly there. You play as multiple characters who have no impact in the grand scheme of things so what's the point of them existing besides filler? Another issue is that the enemies lack in variety, you're still fighting the same 3 types just with slight differences depending on what part of the story you're on that don't make a huge impact on your gameplay strategies. Also I feel that while the game has a pretty decent amount of length for this type of genre. But that's also kind of a bad thing, the gameplay can be quite repetitive after long periods of time. This game was clearly made for you to just rush through it in 1 long sitting but 3/4ths of the way through you're basically just forcing yourself to advance the story.\n\nIs the game better than the first?

The premise is simple, you're put into an area and your job is to make sure nobody in that area is still alive when you're done with them. There's a little less replayability in the levels because many of them lack masks, but the levels are more tightly designed than Hotline Miami's. The gameplay is fast and satisfying, the music is loud and chaotic, and the visual are polished to mirror shine. If you liked Hotline Miami, you'll like this.

It's basically the first game, again but with a lot more characters, a more screwed up story and twice the rage. This time though, you will need to use guns, no questions asked.\n\nPROS\n-Gameplay in general is still great, with the intense music adding on\n-Soundtrack is amazing, I personally think it's even better than the first (while maybe not as memorable, it really made me feel chills at certain parts)\n-Graphics are rad, slightly less ugly than the first and still a gory masterpiece through and through.\n-Story. It is way more prominent (and convoluted) than the first one. Gives a lot of back, front, and side stories to the first game.\n-Wayyyyy more characters, and more ways to play. Twin Swans with a gun and a chainsaw, a writer who refuses to kill or use guns, the son of a russian mob boss, and a soldier with a resupplying gun and combat knife are just a few of the playable characters. This game will force you to switch it up a lot, so be wary.\nCONS\n-Mainly the increase of gun reliance and windows here. Far too much hide and seek with enemies, and bullets from across the now huge maps can kill you from somewhere you can't even see.\n-The gameplay is not as smooth and flowy as the first, something I really don't like. Sometimes this can be negated I find with the Tony mask, which is my favourite mask in both games. It gives you a lot of stopping power, even against those big goons.\n\nOverall, this is a great game much like the first. I would give it an 8.8/10.\n\n\n\n\n\n11/10 would GOTTA GET A GRIP again.","April 29, 2015","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But i dont think its the masterpiece one would've hoped for. The story lacks highlights and is hard to follow, since there are quite a few characters/story lines and leaps in time back and forth. And there is a lot more dialogue compared to the original. This is of course related to the longer playtime in general, i think its safe to say its about twice the content of the original. There are hups maps with multiple floors in over 20 levels (i needed 7 hours for a complete playthrough, but i skipped a lot of dialogue).\n\nAnd you will die thousands of times, since this part is heavily focused on gunplay and if you dont freelook all the time you will get sniped from the edge of the screen. Higher difficulty comes from special enemies with either bullet or melee imunity aswell, overall it feels like you have to play more strategic and cant just rush in and expect to kill everything if you have fast reflexes.\nI didnt like the high amount of gunfights because they tend to become really frustrating and take the flow - who defines in my opinion the awesomeness of this franchise - out of the game. A great addition from my perspective are the different playable characters (sometimes fixed, sometimes you are able to choose) with different abilities (e.g. akimbo smgs, killing punches, gun&knife).\nSome other weak points are: bossfights with little feedback on what to do to kill the boss, also quite a few glitches and bugs.\nBut dont get me wrong, i fully recommend buying it, i had a good time playing it and its definitely worth the price.","March 11, 2015","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It has more tracks than the first game did by a long shot, and to top it all off they're all just as good. I'll probably end up buying it soon.\n\nOne of the replayability factors for this one comes from Hard Mode, which unlocks when you complete the normal mode of the game. It makes EVERYTHING worse. The enemies have better aim, reaction time, there are more of the 'big' enemies that you have to shoot in order to kill.\n\nAnother thing that makes hardmode harder is that when you hold shift to look further, you have to aim in the opposite direction, so you can't use it to easily shoot people who are off-screen. Oh, no lock-on either. Did I mention no lock-on?\n\nOverall I'd definitely recommend buying this game if you enjoyed the first one or if you're looking for a challenge. It's got hours of content, and some nice achievements in it too. 9/10 from me, and when the level editor comes out, it'll be a 10.","March 13, 2015","true","24.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, while it does much right it does have a few things that aren't so great.\n\nStory: Hotline Miami 2 is a much more story driven game than the original which isn't a bad thing. The Story takes place directly after the Original spanning over multiple characters. The story follows Martin Brown, The Fans, Detective Manny Pardo, Evan, Jake, The Son, The Soldier, Richter, and even a Henchman. Each have different motivations and Plots based around the Protagonist from Hotline Miami or Fifty Blessings organization from the original. In the end it does a nice job of wrapping up the events of the first game.\n\nThe Ending:  The ending was fairly disappointing and without foreknowledge made no sense. In the end everyone ends up dead whether through suicide or the blast of a nuclear bomb, everyone dies in the end. Hard mode does tack on a nice poem in the credits but, it's still lackluster.\n\nGameplay: Hotline Miami 2 sticks to the run and gun style play of the original but with more of a focus on guns. With each of the playable characters you're given a different play style ranging from Corey's dodge roll, Tony's restriction to melee only, or the Pacifist style of Evan. This game like the original  keeps you on your toes and thinking almost constantly.\n\nGraphics & Sound: There's not much to say for graphics as it sticks to the style of the original. The environments still feel fresh and interesting even after playing through the game a few times. Once again, the soundtrack is phenomenal with tracks that really set the mood and will keep you hooked for the entire duration of the game. I can't recommend this game's soundtrack enough.\n\nHard Mode: I mentioned Hard Mode earlier so I might as well touch on it. Hard Mode is unlocked after beating the game and it removes the lock-on feature, mirrors the stages, adds more windows, there's less doors, adds more of the tougher enemies, and dropping a weapons makes it lose half it's ammo. While this might seem fair by the end it will leave you frustrated and feeling cheated. In my experience I had to restart a few levels just because I had the wrong weapon. Hard Mode almost forces you into a slow and steady approach rather than run and gun.\n\nTLDR: 9/10 The games great overall and I recommend it to anyone who was a fan of the original.\n","June 3, 2015","true","37.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

They are very fun and action packed. My favorite part of this game is the style, It reminds me of GTA but simplifed down to a retro arcade machine style.

The masks are all so unique and some have awesome abilites (others not so much). One tip is aim for high combos, that'll get you higher grades and even A+'s for you overachievers.

There arent that many Masks, but that doesnt mean its bad. It has lots of characters, some of it can choose "masks" or "techniques".\n\nStory:\nThe story is ♥♥♥♥ing epic, if you played the first Motline Miami you will understand much more, so i recommend getting the first Hotline Miami first, so that you understand mostly of the plot. In the second Hotline Miami is the story more complicated, but that doesnt mean its more worse, its better!\n\nGameplay:\nI would say, the gameplay is even better in Hotline Miami 2. In other reviews you will find somthing like: "Worst level design!" or "This game is way to hard". Some levels are really godamn hard, but i loved it. The difficulty is way higher in this one. The Floors are much bigger now, more open and harder. Which i liked!. Dont buy this game though if you hate hard games. I raged alot in the "Hard Mode(which you unlock after completing the normal game)" But i loved it still. Just finished Hard Mode too. If you love difficult games with different gamestyles to play it, this is the game for you! And when the Level Editor comes out, its even more fun ;P\n\nMusic:\nIts more varied than the first one. You have sad music, happy music, dramatic music, just everything! Besides that, everything is "techno" or "dupsteb". But that doesnt mean its bad, its ♥♥♥♥ing epic! I would recommend buying the soundtrack!\n\nEffects:\nThe old color background is still there, with its best. But now there are more Effects. Which are really epic. I loved going through the 90's and 80's in this game.\n\nProblems:\nThere are a few problems, but i didnt have any. Well in-game yes. But only glitches where enemies get stuck in the door or so. Its not that bad. But if the problems are not in-game, it gets hard. Many have mouse glitches, keyboard glitches, a not starting game and slow-motion. I think sorting out those problems, isnt even that hard. You just need some help(or an better pc :/(which is really rare)).\n\nI would give this game a 9/10! More gameplay options, more things, more EVERYTHING!\n","March 21, 2015","true","77.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Too many enemies with guns and death is a constant. If you're persistent enough, you can unlock the Karma achievement (die 1000 times) on your first sitting.

The ideas that made HM1 so satisfying are contradicted in HM2.\n\nHM1 is a fast paced, beat-em up from enemy to enemy, where YOU change your plan if it does not work from level to level. I fell in love with this playstyle and still play HM1 to this day.\n\nHM2 just went against all that HM1 built on, which is a real bummer.\n\n1. The game and character design doesn't let YOU change your plan to beat a level, THE GAME CHANGES YOUR PLAN FOR YOU. The new characters are cool additions because each one carries a backstory, but in-game each one forces you to change and the "A-Ha" moment you get when you find a nice route through a level is ruined becaause you didn't find it, the game forced you to find it.\n\n2. The game feels generally slower and I felt less like a badass. With all the increased enemies in each level, I felt like I was played a cover shooter more than a "run through a house and be a walking death machine". Not to mention that when you knock over an enemy the ground pounding takes FOREVER. It is signifigantly slower than that of HM1 and it led me to so many deaths. This is especially true in the Hawaii levels because when you run out of ammo, you feel so weak.\n\n3. There are no secrets or collectables. I personally, but not for all, was really into finding all the secret letters and secret masks. There are none in this game.\n\n4. This game is feeling more like an angrier Super Meat Boy. The steep difficulty curve in this game, and especially with some levels.  I felt like I was playing Super Meat Boy, just running in and suiciding because of all the enemy sightlines. I would try to adapt but, like the the first point, I couldn't because the game stops me from trying different varieties.\n\n\nHotline Miami is fun game to play, but it doesn't feel like Hotline Miami. the music and atmosphere is still there, but I felt so weak and slow. I would recommend this game for someone who wants a top-down beat-em up, but not for someone who wants the genuine Hotline Miami experience.","March 10, 2015","true","36.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The levels are larger and differ more from eachother, but it often feels like you're being shot from something you couldn't see coming and there's not much room for changing up how you tackle each individual level. (Espescially with how much you rely on guns in this game)\nThere's more masks, but they're assigned to specific characters so in the end there's less variety on a level by level basis, but more variety on the whole.\nSpecfic characters requiring slightly different tactics is cool, but usually it's in the form limiting you, rather than adding to your arsenal of options.\n\nThe only thing I can say is 100% worse than the previous game is the "flow" of the game. Being good at the game helps a lot, but it doesn't change that for the most part it is much safer to lure enemies around corners. Yeah yeah, you're really funny with all your "enjoy your C-" comments, but if a shotgun shoots only once every third of a second when there's 3 enemies in a room who shoot pretty much instantly, there's just no way you're gonna rush through and shoot them before they kill you.\n\nOverall, HM2 was enjoyable but it just doesn't have that same high paced, adrenaline up the buttocks kind of action that I was hoping for.","March 18, 2015","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombologist83/recommended/274170/","zombologist83","AmericanSmeagol","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombologist83/","213 products in account","One of the first things I noticed about Hotline Miami 2 was that its soundtrack felt slower to me, more cinematic and larger in scope. I think that best encapsulates HLM2: larger in scope. A lot about this game won't make sense on your first play through, you will curse frequently and the playstyle you were used to is no longer effective in this game. Still, this game builds on what made the first one great and offers a ton more replayability for those who want it.\n\nMoving on to level design, because this is a controversial talking point for this game, I am ambivalent. Hotline 1 feels claustrophobic compared to this game. There is a lot more space to run and maneuver, which becomes important the more that gunplay gets involved. Because practically every enemy has guns, levels are no longer small hallways. There is a lot more happening in the background now too. You'll notice it most in the second scene, but it's present all over the game. Set pieces that tip over or rotate as you move past them. You'll also notice A TON OF WINDOWS have now been added to the game. I personally found some levels to be extremely frustrating, but I also learned more about how the game works (like using windows to my advantage). As someone who appreciates a game that teaches players, I ultimately enjoyed this aspect.\n\nThey've stopped that annoying camera bobbing thing that made 1 feel like it was floating in a pool of water, but they didn't pull the camera back. Because so many enemies with guns appear off screen, you will frequently die from bullets shot by guns you can't see. That means mastering, or becoming familiar with, shift looking is crucial. Failure to shift look will extend your play time by several excruciating hours. Stop resisting shift look because you can snipe with pistols from across the map.\n\nThis is a game built for perfectionists and speedrunners. That unforgiving difficulty is why NES games like Ninja Gaiden live on in our hearts. It's not about finishing the level, anyone can do that with a simple game of peek-a-boo as has been pointed out on these forums. It's about discovering methods to lure and murder in groups. Combos are so much more effective (and harder to get) in this game, and boldness and flexibility scores actually matter. This game, when played at a high level, is all about speed and flexibility. You can dodge bullets now, something that was virtually impossible in part one.\n\nI have come to the realization that the story is like an homage to Drive. If you've ever seen that movie, it's easy to find yourself left with a lot of questions about the characters you just met. Much like in HLM1, where the world is not quite what it seems. For instance, the community has yet to come to a consensus on how much of HLM1 happened in Jacket's real life and how much was a coma dream. There are two stories happening here: what you actually see and how it fits into the scope of the Hotline Miami timeline. The latter is what makes the story rewarding, because the former is quite jumbled and in some cases very abrupt.\n\nThose who want to replay a game and learn it will find the experience of Hotline Miami 2 to be a frustrating climb to a satisfying top. Those expecting a fun and twitchy murder simulator that lasts for a few hours might find themselves disappointed by this experience.\n\nAsk yourself which of these gamers you are before you buy this game.\n\n[[*Edit: A note on hard mode. I thought it was too hard, like suck the fun out of the game hard. I'll probably finish it because I'm kind of a super fan of this game, but I am not enjoying that part at all.]]","March 18, 2015","true","121.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Many ascribe that title to the likes of 'The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time', 'Batman Arkham City' or even 'The World Ends With You', however, those aren't nearly as astonishing as Wrong Number. Any major publisher can throw a pile of money at a development team, cater to the masses and market the hell out of it but to create something like Hotline Miami, even the first one, it takes true artists. When the latter released in 2012 Jonatan Söderström and Dennis Wedin created something completely unique and their own. No compromises were made to appeal to a wider crowd and everything in the game served a purpose and not just because it looked 'cool'.\n\nWhen you would be asking yourself why you have to mash the A button to open up a ventilation shaft in Arkham City (when we clearly agreed that this was shitty busywork which adds NOTHING to the experience of any work of art a decade ago), no one would ask a similar question when it comes to Hotline Miami. In a sense, Hotline Miami can be seen as a 'Gesamtkunstwerk', all of the elements (story, graphics, gameplay, soundtrack) strive for a greater goal than the sums of their parts. Without the story it could be written off as just another mass murder simulator, without the graphics and their effects it wouldn't have the same kind of feeling, the pixilated violence contributing a special bit (ha) overshadowing any childish bloodfest in 'Grand Theft Auto' or 'Metal Gear Solid', without the gameplay you wouldn't have the interactivity and immersion the story so desperately needs and without the soundtrack you wouldn't feel you heart pumping at every beat, wanting you to go on.\n\nIf the first game had already established the perfect formula, then why do we need a sequel? Because Hotline Miami had one major problem: It was only 2 hours long, when players were hardly fully satisfied (in fact it has been scientifically proven that it can take a lifetime of playing Hotline Miami for it to get boring) so the sequel made sure to include at least 7 hours of playtime, unlocking a hard mode for additional 15 afterwards. In addition, even though the first one had a near flawless story, OST and presentation, that didn't mean they couldn't be improved, so they turned them up to 11. All these improvements aside, Hotline Miami 2 also did a thing almost every other sequel is afraid to do (see Zelda for example): It picked the difficulty up right where the first one left off. With no thought spent on filthy 'newcomers' to the series feeling left out, Dennaton created exactly what they and their fans wanted and as most series should do, told everyone to play the first one or get fucked. It's just a shame that Deus Ex exists.","November 13, 2015","true","54.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First of all it feels like the camera should be just a bit "higher" and the shift-look thingy is way too limited. I would say about 85% of my deaths were by enemies who i had no chance of seeing or even know they are there, this escalated to almost rage-quit proporsions in few missions, other one had trees blocking the view and other was so damn dark it was almost impossible to see the enemies (or those dogs). So many times i got shot by enemy i had no chance of seeing and i guess that was not the point. The other part that annoyed me were the boss battles, especially the final boss, i had real problems of seeing what was going on in my game and it really annoyed me a lot. But if that is not a dealbreaker this game is well worth your money. The music is awesome and i really liked the story, even if it is a bit of a convoluted mess, but it kinda gives it some replay value because you might notice some details on the second go that you missed before. The game was also surprisingly long or i might just suck at it. All in all i would give this game something like 8/10, the music and that weird story really hit the spot but it does have some problems like all games do.","December 10, 2015","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Though it lacks in the versatility department due to following a more strict narrative, the true scope of the hotline miami story is revealed.  Extremely complex and thoroughly engaging.  Its also much more difficult than the first.  Keeping all that in mind you may understand why a lot of fans of the first aren't so fond of the second.  So...the game is either a 9.2 / 10 if you can dig this sort of thing and the changes it brings with it OR 8 / 10 for being more linear.

The game features multiple protagonists and is the sequel to the incredible Hotline Miami.\n\n8/10Recommended Purchase\nIf you enjoyed this review,consider giving it a thumbs up!\n\nPros\n+Gameplay\nThis is one hell of a fast paced game. You pick up various weapons as you go and proceed to smash,stab,or shoot all of your endless enemies. The game is fairly long and is very VERY difficult. You may even get to the point where you think the game is all artificial difficulty. You could not be more wrong. The game is incredibly challenging but combined with the great soundtrack it makes for some awesome fast paced murder sprees.\n\n+Soundtrack\nThis soundtrack,while in my opinion being nowhere near as good as the first one, is still absolutely stellar. In the soundtrack we see a return from artists such as M|O|O|N and Perturbator. This soundtrack isn't as good as the first but damn it makes for some great moments.\n\n+Story\nThis one is interesting. The story is complete and total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and I understand NONE of it. Thought it sure as hell pulled me in and now I cant help but wanting more explanation and lore behind this. It may not be the best but I sure as hell looked forward to learning more and more.\n\nCons:\n-Maps\nAlright so this game introduces very very big maps compared to the original. There were chapters of the first game that were about the size of a single floor in this one. The maps ♥♥♥♥ with the gameplay in such a way that you may be murdering mobsters one moment and then having to sit there and scout the next zone the next. All that just to make sure that you dont get shot through a random ♥♥♥ window when you cant even see your enemy.\n\n-Characters\nSo in Hotline Miami you played as one guy with a lot of masks to differentiate things. In Hotline 2 you play as like 8 characters who each have a few masks each. This is just stupid. Why change that? I assume its for story but even still.\n\nAs you can probably see the pros far out weigh the cons on this game so pick it up ASAP. This may not be the Hotline Miami sequel I was looking for but ill be damned if it doesn't come close.\n\nIf you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to join my Steam Curator Group at  Mudkips Gaming","June 26, 2015","true","42.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

These include (but is not limited to) getting my head dented in with a baseball bat, getting ravaged by several attack dogs, sent to a hospital, then dying from losing all my stomach acid, getting punched down by a fat guy simply because I don't understand the door mechanics, allowing an insane inmate to introduce my brain to the cold, hard ground, and I've had an intimate relationship with a gun. And that's just in the game. I wouldn't be surprised if I snapped a vocal chord trying to run away from a fat guy, who for some reason, only dies to bullets. Also, every now and then, I take a break from gaming, mostly because I want to rest my eyes. HM2 makes me rest because if I continued playing, an unexplainable hole will form in my computer's moniter, likely in the shape of my fist.\n\nIn short, you'll die. A lot. Still a virgin?

And I dont think much will change that.\n\nThe gameplay is like the same in Hotline Miami 1 but it's in the right way. And we all know how amazing the gameplay in HM1 is. I feel like you need to play a little bit less aggresive though, probably cause of the level design.\n\nThe music is even better than the first one, and I seriously think this is the best music I have ever heard in a video game before. It's insane and fits the game so well.\n\nThe graphics..Well, not so much to say about it. I like it though.\n\nYou will see alot of glitches with the walls but it's nothing big. Only things like bodies and blood going through them.\n\nThis game can be frustrating sometimes cause of the level design, the levels are pretty big. And in a game where you can die by one bullet. That's not so good.\n\nOne of the biggest feautres I would want for this game is a replay thing, cause sometimes you just go ''how the hell did I even manage to do that?'' And you want to check it out again in slow motion and stuff. But you cant unless you recorded it.\n\nThe story got a little bit more intrestring for me. Since it has alot of more playable characters. I disliked the ending though.\n\nThere's also a level editor coming out soon.\n\nPros: Outstanding music\nAmazing gameplay\nLevel editor\nGood Story\n\nCons:Frustating levels\nSome glitches\n\n9/10","April 1, 2015","true","85.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some of the maps suffered from things like enemies being able to shoot from outside of the field of vision, which made finishing levels in a single run nearly impossible, and resulted in a LOT of trial by memorization.\n\nI had fun with this game - in short sessions. There was a point where I was wondering if there was going to be an "end," and the actual finale came WAY after that point - so I wouldn't recommend playing this in marathon sessions. If you like pixelated gore and occasional (i.e. you get lucky) runs that have a faux 8/16-bit John Woo meets Sam Peckinpah guns n' blood fest, then this game is for you. The story itself is very loosely implied (it ranks somewhere just above the plot to the original Centipede arcade game), so just use those intermissions to un-cramp your thumbs and wipe the sweat off your palms.\n\nFun?

That game basically showed me the beautiful world of indie games (ok, there was Braid, World of Goo etc). Indie games are very special, because it can contain all the crazy ideas that triple-A games would never do.\nHotline Miami was frenetic, high-speed, aggresive top-down ♥♥♥♥´em up masterpiece with, believe it or not, very interesting and trippy story. And it was frustrating. Oh my gaaawd the frustration. Press "R", you know what I mean. But for me, this masterpiece had one ace in the sleeve. Music. Music was the thing that blasted this game to the sky heights. Music was so memorable, so weird, yet so awesome. Horse Steppin´, that is all I am gonna write.\nThe second Hotline Miami was one of my most anticipated games of 2015, no kidding. Was it worth waiting? Well, yes.\nThe gameplay is enhanced by some cool stuff like akimbo shooting, two-in-one characters (Ducks) and lot of other things.\nWhat about the music? The soundtrack is totally amazing. For me even better than in the first Hotline. There is around 50 songs. And every single one is great. I am listening to it every day, at least two or three songs. Yes,  I am addicted :) Psychedelic, trippy, 80s - 90s sound. You will love it. (Carpenter Brut is now my favourite "band").\nThe story is very, very complex, because often you do not know if it is hallucination or reality. And it is great. I am not saying that I understood the story, but I enjoyed it very much ( like I would enjoy David Lynch movie). Also the story was quite longer than the first one.\n\nNow the bad things. Level design. Level design is, compared to the first one, different. First one was with close corridors, so there were lot of opportunities to make a 10x+ combo. In HM2 you will  spend lot of time covering behind the corners, waiting for the enemies to approach you. It is more stealthy and more frustrating (yes, it is), because since the levels are very open, enemies can spot you from a very long distance and you will end up dead not knowing who shot you (later on you will learn that it was that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the other side of the map). This was basically the only thing that bothered me during my play. I would prefer more closed levels like in the first one.\nBesides of this, I enjoyed HM2 a lot and I hope there will be a third one.\n8,5/10\n11/10 for music","August 5, 2015","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is far more story driven than the first, and though it is an interesting-if trippy-story, it can be annoying the have to connect the dots yourself and remember who characters were that you stopped playing an hour ago after wasting time on a hard level.  Also, for those who want to know, here is a breakdown of how you will die in this game:\n\n90% due to enemies offscreen\n6% due to glitches\n4% due to legitimate screw ups you could have avoided\n\nThe gigantic level design of this game is what separates it from the last as it allows for enemies with laser accuracy to shoot you from across the map without you being able to see them.  This can become incredibly frustrating for many and the main reason I powered through this game is because I loved the first one.  Needless to say, I will never bother completing hard mode in this game.\n\nEven with these problems it is still a fun game with some extremely exciting and fun moments.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexBombEverywhere/recommended/274170/","SexBombEverywhere","Tommy Wiseau","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexBombEverywhere/","510 products in account","I have to admit, Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number is a step down from it's predecessor in terms of it's gameplay. The original Hotline Miami boasts high octane-filled close quarters combat, filled with as much gratuitous violence it's retro 16bit inspired top-down graphics can handle, with psychedelic visuals and a permadeath-lite feature that's bound to keep you on the edge of your seat, with different masks to cater to different playthroughs, giving the short 3-4 hour game much replayability.\n\nAnd then HM2:WN essentially removed all of this. The masks are replaced with level-specific characters, which, instead of offering minor perks to nudge the player, straight up shoves the player into adopting certain playstyles. The close quarters combat the original used to have becomes long hallways with bullets coming at you off-screen. Granted, the game is still pretty fun, but in comparison to the absolutely fantastic Hotline Miami, isn't really saying a lot.\n\nAt this point of my review, you might be wondering why do I recommend this game? Well, because of the story. Well the first game's abstract story was essentially a great statement on violence in video games, complete with surrealistic elements, HM2:WN has a coherent, maybe even movie-worthy story that overshadows it's predecessor in terms of both scale and content, but also boasts well-developed characters with personality, juxtaposing the repetitive and ridiculously violent gameplay.\n\nAt the end of the day, the pros of HM2:WN's story is enough to outweigh the cons of it's gameplay. But you don't really play games for their plot do you? So what I'm trying to say is, if you're the kind of person who actually cares about the story when you play video games, this is a must-get. But if you're just looking for something to blow off some steam with after a long day's work, this is probably not the game for you.","April 2","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There was alot of hype to this game. And when it came out... it was a mixed bag for some people. Some people loved it, some people hated it. But now that the level editor (Beta) has come out, I feel like it's time to give a PROPER review for this game.\nHotline Miami 2 uses the same formula of gameplay that the original did. But the biggest change in gameplay has to come from the levels it creates.\nThe levels are either a pro or a con. The levels, instead of being not so spread out, being close together, and each room having a considerable amount of enemies and weapons to defend yourself with. But instead, Hotline Miami 2. has VERY spread out levels, alot of glass, and tons and tons of enemies. I for one like it. I don't like the glass, (To be honest, nobody does.) and way too many armed enemies. But that's okay.\nThe gameplay as I said before stays the same, but they find ways to shake it up a bit for a few levels.\nThe story becomes a major part of the game, unlike the original that focused on violence and gore. And it takes a rather interesting turn aswell. They introduce tons of new characters.\n-The Fans\n-The Writer\n-The Cop\n-The Cobra\n-The Rat\n-The Soldier\n-The Son\nAnd a list of side characters too. It introduces them in a non-linear way, switching to the 80's in a very well, 80's way. It switches up the story.\nRemember those little plot twists at the end of a few levels in Hotline Miami 1? Like the S.W.A.T team invading the place you were sent to. Or having to kill Hobo in Metro? Well, not many of those are present. Sure, you have the occasional character(s) death, and sometimes some twists, but not many gameplay plot twists. Could use more of those.\nThe main campaign is good in itself, but slightly disappointing in a few ways.\nThe AI in the game is a pro and a con. They give you a good ol' challenge, yet it feels like aimbot. With the inclusion of off-screen deaths, it will screw up your run badly. Yet it feels fair, but still feels unfair, however that may feel '-_-'\nSo finally, the level editor. It's still in Beta at the moment, but it works. It's very glitchy. It tends to crash alot, so save often. Other than that it's a level editor! It works! It's good! A workshop has yet to be included.\n---------------------\nSo IS HM2 better that HM1?  I will answer that question with a "Yes".\nThe game also forces you to get better at shooting. Remember that.\nSo yes, I recommend this game as an immediate purchase for fans of the first game, or people who just want more Hotline Miami.\nIt's good. That's all there is to say.","March 25, 2015","true","147.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you don’t care about getting achievements, and just play the game for the story, I can see this being around 10 hours or so. (Regardless of the length, it’s still a worthy purchase.)\n\nHotline Miami 2: Wrong Number is interesting. Compared with the first game, there are many notable improvements such as storytelling, soundtrack and presentation. However, it takes a couple steps back in gameplay, which sucks because well...the fast paced gameplay makes up 90% of the game. I found myself dying waaaay too many times from enemies off screen, or random enemy movements. I thought the first game had wonky A.I. here and there, but not as bad as this game. One of the things that made the first game great was the ability to learn levels, and maneuver them to your bidding. What helped in that too was the fact that you had such an array of masks to choose from for every single level. In the sequel, you are severely limited to gameplay styles. I think it’s a clear example of how a hard game shouldn’t be frustrating, it should encourage the player to think, adapt and overcome the difficulty.\n\nAll that being said, the story in this game is ♥♥♥♥ing insane and will make you want to keep playing. The diverse array of characters, themes, and shifts in storytelling make for one of the most unique story experiences I've had in a long time. The expanded soundtrack is also fantastic. In the first game, several tracks were repeated for multiple levels. Not that there was a problem with that as the original soundtrack was incredible, (and I would say overall was more cohesive than Wrong Number's soundtrack) but it's really nice and fresh to have individual songs back every level in the game. It makes certain levels really memorable.\n\nUnless you try for all achievements and A+ like me, then you really shouldn't have a problem progressing level to level, as it's only reeaally when you challenge yourself to get a high score that the flaws in gameplay show. But that being said, even taking my time on some levels in hard mode made me want to bash my head against a wall. Overall, I'd give it a flat 8.0/10. The level design in the original is leagues better, however I think Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number is still a great game, and a worthy sequel, even if the progression and tediousness in the gameplay becomes apparent.\n","April 7, 2015","true","51.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The masks are all so unique and some have awesome abilites (others not so much). One tip is aim for high combos, that'll get you higher grades and even A+'s for you overachievers.

It's okay I guess. I recommend getting the first one instead.\n\nThe Good:\n1. The music is like the first one, stellar and simply awesome.\n2. Combat system is fast paced and bloody brilliant.\n\nThe Bad:\n1. The level design is horrible. You'll be shot by a random dude who you can't even see. The maps are way too big, or at least there are too many open fields which are simply lethal for someone who has a limited view.\n2. It's sometimes buggy (looking at you teleporting dogs and see-through doors <.<).\n\nThe 'meh':\n1. The new characters are a bit, ehm how should I put this? ehm,...well they're s(h)it. Some characters are simply useless. One guy who you play as is a 'pacifist'. Although you can pick up guns after forcing him to kill a couple of guys, you usually get shot a million times trying to do so.\n2. The combat relies heavily on guns. The only way you'll get to kill someone is by baiting them to come to you. It's simply bland and it's missing the rushing in and killing part.\n\nThe first one's a lot better if you ask me.\nI recommend waiting until it's on sale or something.\n\n2.5/5 would meh again.","March 11, 2015","false","22.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Could be bumped up to a 9/10 due to the slight changes in story if playing on hard mode after completing the first run.\nLevel Design - 8/10 For the most part exceptional, though in some sections it is nearly impossible to clear the entire floor in one combo due to distances between enemies.\n\n\nProbably a perfect sequel to the original Hotline Miami. The game flicks between flashbacks and present day for multiple characters. With different characters and different time periods the challenges change, in some cases only having access to a single gun chosen at the beginning of the level and an army knife, where you must look for the very rare ammo dumps if you do run out of bullets. In other cases you cannot use guns at all.\n\nThe new fan (mask) system adds a refreshing spin on the old system from the original game. Each character only having access to a few different fans, and these give only slight differences in abilities. Gone are the days of cycling through the tens of different fans trying to decide which would best suit your playing style or be most effective for that specific level. All fans are effective in each level in their different ways.\n\nThe story, while confusing at first does tie up all the loose ends upon completion of the first run. Even going so far as to explain the history behind the original Miami Killer and other seemingly minor characters in the original game. I would highly reccomend immediately starting a replay on hard mode after completing the first playthrough, as there are some small differences at the beginning of the hard mode story.\n\nThe gameplay is as good as ever, with only slight issues where elements that appeared to be part of the floor actually end up getting you stuck and killed. Upon switching to hard mode the levels actually flip, with the same layout but this time from a different perspective. While this seems as if it wouldn't change much, it does make the levels harder, changing sight lines of enemies and the way that you approach that 20X combo. In hard mode guns you pick up will have extremely reduced ammo, with shotguns only holding 3 rounds instead of the regular 6. (This is the only one I remember, as I don't usually pick up any other type of gun) Enemies in hard mode seem to have almost supersonic hearing and hawkeye vision, forcing you to react much more quickly and plan everything on the fly.\n\nAn incredible soundtrack accompanies the game. I downloaded the soundtrack weeks before the game was released, and enjoyed it extremely. Back to the roots of the original Hotline Miami, the synths and deep beats keep you on the edge of your seat while mowing down enemies one after the other.\n\nNot much can be said about the graphics, pixely as they are I fell in love with the art style of the original Hotline Miami, and no changes were made for this one, making me one happy guy. *cough* Binding of Isaac Rebirth *cough*\n\nThe only real issue I had with the entire game was that one floor of the apartment where the stairs were set up in the most awkward configuration. Who hired that architect? No wonder there was a serial killer in that complex, if I had to go through that every day I'd probably be on the lookout for someone too.","June 23, 2015","true","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's a little less replayability in the levels because many of them lack masks, but the levels are more tightly designed than Hotline Miami's. The gameplay is fast and satisfying, the music is loud and chaotic, and the visual are polished to mirror shine. If you liked Hotline Miami, you'll like this.

I will, however, mark them as spoilers. Just don't click on them even if you find it tempting, because everything under that is story related. Good? Good.\n\nThe first Hotline Miami was released back in 2012, and it became a large success, critics and fans alike praised it for its fast paced, adrenaline fueled ultraviolence to the catchy soundtrack made by several rather unkown but very talented artists, unlike most games which featured a single score made by one person.\nThe story in the first Hotline Miami was simplistic, and relied on more subtle means to tell its story. The main character never speaks, although there is dialogue in the game.\n\nThe gameplay consisted of fast dispatching of russian mobsters with various blunt weaponry such as a pool cue or a baseball bat, kitchen appliances, throwables such as bricks, darts, and glass bottles, as well as firearms.\nThe levels were rather small, enemies were in a reasonable distance from each other and it was all a very compact format, which lent itself rather well to its very melee-centric combat. You kill fast and die fast, one hit and everyone's out, unless you throw your weapon or punch them when not wearing a tiger mask.\n\nThe second game is the same in core principle, albeit with some changes. It feels a bit slower, heavier in a way.\nBut the most jarring part of it is the level design. Initially rather well done, soon you can't help but feel that they are too big for their own good. Hotline Miami is a concept that doesn't lend itself to large levels. Here's a list of problems that arrives with the large level format.\nThe levels become cluttered with all the gore, bodies, and guns. Easy to lose track of your enemies.\nCan't always see the entire way forward, even with shift-look it sometimes won't be enough.\nLarge chance to get shot offscreen by something you didn't see\nHere comes some story stuff.\nThe story in Hotline Miami 2 is a lot more developed than the first game, and has several links and returning characters. The barkeep from the first game was in the army with Jacket, Richter was caring for his mother and biker... Well.\nHotline Miami has several characters that it focuses on. The detective, who plays like Jacket except can shoot faster and aim faster with the shotgun, the Writer, who has a non-lethal style and allows for the combo to be kept up by picking up guns and unloading them,  but can go berserk if you kill two people. As well as the "fans", the very prominent group which has some unique playstyles, such as dual machineguns pointed in different directions, being able to dodge roll under enemy fire, instakilling fists and a duo of Swans with chainsaw and firearms.\n\nOne of the key components of the Hotline Miami series is the music, and it is delivered in spades on that front. The music far outmatches the first game which was also fantastic, and the soundtrack is in my opinion worth picking up.\n\nHotline Miami 2 is a hard game.\nAn unforgiving game, yet very forgiving at the same time.\nThe levels are long and large, but you can instantly respawn if you die, and you will die. A ton.\nYou will probably die a lot more in the second game than in the first one, the reaction time on enemies seems to have been reduced slightly and they can therefore react to you quicker. The most successful tactic so far is baiting out and taking your time with the enemies, as in some of the larger levels it is very, very hard to get a complete combo going.\nBut it is overall a compelling and certainly an unique experience, and if you liked the first game I'd recommend picking this one up too.\n\nMy favorite track is "Rust" by El Huervo. It kicks ♥♥♥.","March 11, 2015","true","26.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The tutorial opens with a depiction of a violent ♥♥♥♥, fading to black and then panning to a director yelling "Cut!". Richard (the chicken mask, a character who makes a lot more sense if you remember he is constantly talking to the player) then appears, almost mocking the player character at this time who is trying to justify the violence in the movie by saying "it's just a film".\n\nThis is Hotline Miami 2's thesis statement. Is all of this violence OK because it's a video game? Does media have any real repercussions on our psyche, and if so, shouldn't it be treated more seriously?\n\nThe actual gameplay is a fun but the artificial difficulty, especially in later levels, made this game feel significantly less satisfying and more frustrating than the original Hotline Miami. While weapons have been added and you now have more methods to take on the challenges presented, none of it feels integral to the gameplay. Instead many of the additions feel tacked on, I could imagine the sentence "This is Hotline Miami 2, so we need more!" being said during development, and I don't think that's what I personally wanted from the sequel.\n\nStory is a larger focus in Hotline Miami 2 than it's predecessor, or more specifically the story is told in more depth by multiple characters. Much of the same ground is covered in this story, but with more characters (MANY more) and more interactions between them.\n\nHotline Miami 2 is a great game with some serious flaws. If you want more hotline miami this is the game for you, but if you want more of what hotline miami did best you might want to skip this. Despite all of this, I am still recommending Hotline Miami 2, because at the end of the day it is still fun.","March 13, 2015","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Good.\n\nThe first Hotline Miami was released back in 2012, and it became a large success, critics and fans alike praised it for its fast paced, adrenaline fueled ultraviolence to the catchy soundtrack made by several rather unkown but very talented artists, unlike most games which featured a single score made by one person.\nThe story in the first Hotline Miami was simplistic, and relied on more subtle means to tell its story. The main character never speaks, although there is dialogue in the game.\n\nThe gameplay consisted of fast dispatching of russian mobsters with various blunt weaponry such as a pool cue or a baseball bat, kitchen appliances, throwables such as bricks, darts, and glass bottles, as well as firearms.\nThe levels were rather small, enemies were in a reasonable distance from each other and it was all a very compact format, which lent itself rather well to its very melee-centric combat. You kill fast and die fast, one hit and everyone's out, unless you throw your weapon or punch them when not wearing a tiger mask.\n\nThe second game is the same in core principle, albeit with some changes. It feels a bit slower, heavier in a way.\nBut the most jarring part of it is the level design. Initially rather well done, soon you can't help but feel that they are too big for their own good. Hotline Miami is a concept that doesn't lend itself to large levels. Here's a list of problems that arrives with the large level format.\nThe levels become cluttered with all the gore, bodies, and guns. Easy to lose track of your enemies.\nCan't always see the entire way forward, even with shift-look it sometimes won't be enough.\nLarge chance to get shot offscreen by something you didn't see\nHere comes some story stuff.\nThe story in Hotline Miami 2 is a lot more developed than the first game, and has several links and returning characters. The barkeep from the first game was in the army with Jacket, Richter was caring for his mother and biker... Well.\nHotline Miami has several characters that it focuses on. The detective, who plays like Jacket except can shoot faster and aim faster with the shotgun, the Writer, who has a non-lethal style and allows for the combo to be kept up by picking up guns and unloading them,  but can go berserk if you kill two people. As well as the "fans", the very prominent group which has some unique playstyles, such as dual machineguns pointed in different directions, being able to dodge roll under enemy fire, instakilling fists and a duo of Swans with chainsaw and firearms.\n\nOne of the key components of the Hotline Miami series is the music, and it is delivered in spades on that front. The music far outmatches the first game which was also fantastic, and the soundtrack is in my opinion worth picking up.\n\nHotline Miami 2 is a hard game.\nAn unforgiving game, yet very forgiving at the same time.\nThe levels are long and large, but you can instantly respawn if you die, and you will die. A ton.\nYou will probably die a lot more in the second game than in the first one, the reaction time on enemies seems to have been reduced slightly and they can therefore react to you quicker. The most successful tactic so far is baiting out and taking your time with the enemies, as in some of the larger levels it is very, very hard to get a complete combo going.\nBut it is overall a compelling and certainly an unique experience, and if you liked the first game I'd recommend picking this one up too.\n\nMy favorite track is "Rust" by El Huervo. It kicks ♥♥♥.","March 11, 2015","true","26.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This time you take the role of multiple characters each with unique gameplay styles. While it may be a little daunting storywise due to the amount of characters that are in the story, it still holds a solid narrative to the bitter end. Levels are much longer, varied and much more difficult, but I believe that challenge is a good thing since it can keep you playing again and again. If you thought the first game had an amazing soundtrack than prepare for another dose of the most heart-pounding, neon-soaked adrenaline rush beats in the game industry. I personally think the soundtrack complete outshines the original's OST. My only gripe with the game is with the story, I feel like there was little bit more room to develop certain characters more.\n\nOverall, a solid sequel to an already solid game.","May 8, 2015","true","31.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That game basically showed me the beautiful world of indie games (ok, there was Braid, World of Goo etc). Indie games are very special, because it can contain all the crazy ideas that triple-A games would never do.\nHotline Miami was frenetic, high-speed, aggresive top-down ♥♥♥♥´em up masterpiece with, believe it or not, very interesting and trippy story. And it was frustrating. Oh my gaaawd the frustration. Press "R", you know what I mean. But for me, this masterpiece had one ace in the sleeve. Music. Music was the thing that blasted this game to the sky heights. Music was so memorable, so weird, yet so awesome. Horse Steppin´, that is all I am gonna write.\nThe second Hotline Miami was one of my most anticipated games of 2015, no kidding. Was it worth waiting? Well, yes.\nThe gameplay is enhanced by some cool stuff like akimbo shooting, two-in-one characters (Ducks) and lot of other things.\nWhat about the music? The soundtrack is totally amazing. For me even better than in the first Hotline. There is around 50 songs. And every single one is great. I am listening to it every day, at least two or three songs. Yes,  I am addicted :) Psychedelic, trippy, 80s - 90s sound. You will love it. (Carpenter Brut is now my favourite "band").\nThe story is very, very complex, because often you do not know if it is hallucination or reality. And it is great. I am not saying that I understood the story, but I enjoyed it very much ( like I would enjoy David Lynch movie). Also the story was quite longer than the first one.\n\nNow the bad things. Level design. Level design is, compared to the first one, different. First one was with close corridors, so there were lot of opportunities to make a 10x+ combo. In HM2 you will  spend lot of time covering behind the corners, waiting for the enemies to approach you. It is more stealthy and more frustrating (yes, it is), because since the levels are very open, enemies can spot you from a very long distance and you will end up dead not knowing who shot you (later on you will learn that it was that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the other side of the map). This was basically the only thing that bothered me during my play. I would prefer more closed levels like in the first one.\nBesides of this, I enjoyed HM2 a lot and I hope there will be a third one.\n8,5/10\n11/10 for music","August 5, 2015","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

We enjoy snapping and having instinct take over rather than try to plan it all out and fail from 1 mistake.\nYou enjoy running down the mobs, you enjoy dodging the shots and predicting the movements of your eneimes to score wicked combos. That's why all the playable charecters mostly simulate how jacket played in the first game, but they still have their own uniqueness to them in their gameplay and personality in the story.\nBut they, much like us, are drawn in by the tenedencies that draw a mask over their faces, to become the beast within.","May 6, 2015","true","21.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It took me around 9.5 hours, and I did have fun the whole time. I had played the first one and loved it so I gave this one a try, and boy did I spend my money right. The gory mess of corpses combined with the amazing soundtrack was so fun I'm playing the entire game over again.\n\nPros:\n\n-AMAZING soundtrack (seriously, I could listen to it forever)\n-Gory fun\n-Challenging yet addictive\n-Story\n\nCons:\n\n-Story\n-Length\n\nStory is a pro and a con at the same time. If you're looking for a understandable story. This isn't for you. The story is all over the place and when the credits rolled I still had no idea what all of it meant. If you play the game over or simply look it up, you can understand more but there is still a great mystery behind all of it. The game is pretty hard. One shot or one bash to the head with a pipe will kill you. Same for the enemy though. I found it challenging but still very fun and addictive. The one thing I was very disappointed at was the length. Not that is was too short just the fact I WANT MORE HOTLINE MIAMI.\n\nSo overall this is an absolutely great game and you should get it. You will have an eargasm from the epic soundtrack and your eyes will turn red from all the blood and guts you will see. And I promise you. You will love. Every. Damn.

The soundtrack is the best soundtrack I've ever heard from a game, some of the songs, such as IAMTHEKIDYOUKNOWWHATIMEAN - Run, have actualy become some of my favorate songs of all time, which is so rare from a video game soundtrack. The story, though not really advertised, is one of the selling points of the game, the story is incredible, and in the last levels you get this feeling that you are missing so many hidden symbols and secrets, I still dont fully understand all of it, and I can't wait to find a forum or something and hunt for awnsers. The level design is significantly diferent from the first game, the first game was set in small, cramped hosues, this is set in much wider areas, even some areas outside, forcing you to plan your movements even more, or you could be shot from someone across the map. This map design is definately different and changes the gameplay quite a bit, but thats where my one problem with the game is, the level design forces you to use the tactic of peeking round corners to bait people to run at you so you can silently take them out, you will be doing this ALOT. Not to the point where its frustrating or ruins the game, but I'd prefer if not all the levels were wide open, there are admitedly a few levels not wide open, but more variety would be nice. Also, this game is disturbing. Like, really, I guarantee you will be disturbed by this game, it has blood and stuff, oh also, thats his intestines, yeah, you just chainsawed him in the stomach and let his intestines fall onto to the floor. But you are meant to go into it feeling sort of sick, it adds a feel of "What the ♥♥♥♥ is going on" that fits the atmosphere nicely, and as bad as it sounds, you get over that part, partly due to curiosity about the story I guess. Also, the puppet guy creeped me out first time I saw him ;-;.\n\nTL:DR\nGameplay:         9/10\nStory:                 10/10\nLevel Design:     8.5/10\nSoundtrack:       10/10\nOverall: 9.5\nExtras:                Don't spoil the ending or story for yourself, you will have to peek corners to bait people alot and maybe play Hotline Miami first. Also they haven't added the level editor yet, that will be added later.","April 6, 2015","true","45.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, what really takes the biggest hit on points are two of the things that I am not so happy with. Firstly this game relies far far too heavily on windows, which ultimately makes the level design feel more like quantity over quality whereas Hotline Miami's was quality over quantity. Second and most problematic is the way Wrong Number relies much more on gunplay which is disappointing because part of the appeal of Hotline is the chaotic melee violence, but with how many enemies tend to be in this game with guns or the fat bruiser types, you're more than likely going to have to rely on a gun for good portions of the level and that really ruins some of the fun for me. I still recommend the game because despite those two glaring faults it's still a fun game and the soundtrack is ear candy as well.","December 31, 2015","true","18.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

There arent that many Masks, but that doesnt mean its bad. It has lots of characters, some of it can choose "masks" or "techniques".\n\nStory:\nThe story is ♥♥♥♥ing epic, if you played the first Motline Miami you will understand much more, so i recommend getting the first Hotline Miami first, so that you understand mostly of the plot. In the second Hotline Miami is the story more complicated, but that doesnt mean its more worse, its better!\n\nGameplay:\nI would say, the gameplay is even better in Hotline Miami 2. In other reviews you will find somthing like: "Worst level design!" or "This game is way to hard". Some levels are really godamn hard, but i loved it. The difficulty is way higher in this one. The Floors are much bigger now, more open and harder. Which i liked!. Dont buy this game though if you hate hard games. I raged alot in the "Hard Mode(which you unlock after completing the normal game)" But i loved it still. Just finished Hard Mode too. If you love difficult games with different gamestyles to play it, this is the game for you! And when the Level Editor comes out, its even more fun ;P\n\nMusic:\nIts more varied than the first one. You have sad music, happy music, dramatic music, just everything! Besides that, everything is "techno" or "dupsteb". But that doesnt mean its bad, its ♥♥♥♥ing epic! I would recommend buying the soundtrack!\n\nEffects:\nThe old color background is still there, with its best. But now there are more Effects. Which are really epic. I loved going through the 90's and 80's in this game.\n\nProblems:\nThere are a few problems, but i didnt have any. Well in-game yes. But only glitches where enemies get stuck in the door or so. Its not that bad. But if the problems are not in-game, it gets hard. Many have mouse glitches, keyboard glitches, a not starting game and slow-motion. I think sorting out those problems, isnt even that hard. You just need some help(or an better pc :/(which is really rare)).\n\nI would give this game a 9/10! More gameplay options, more things, more EVERYTHING!\n","March 21, 2015","true","77.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I will, however, mark them as spoilers. Just don't click on them even if you find it tempting, because everything under that is story related. Good? Good.\n\nThe first Hotline Miami was released back in 2012, and it became a large success, critics and fans alike praised it for its fast paced, adrenaline fueled ultraviolence to the catchy soundtrack made by several rather unkown but very talented artists, unlike most games which featured a single score made by one person.\nThe story in the first Hotline Miami was simplistic, and relied on more subtle means to tell its story. The main character never speaks, although there is dialogue in the game.\n\nThe gameplay consisted of fast dispatching of russian mobsters with various blunt weaponry such as a pool cue or a baseball bat, kitchen appliances, throwables such as bricks, darts, and glass bottles, as well as firearms.\nThe levels were rather small, enemies were in a reasonable distance from each other and it was all a very compact format, which lent itself rather well to its very melee-centric combat. You kill fast and die fast, one hit and everyone's out, unless you throw your weapon or punch them when not wearing a tiger mask.\n\nThe second game is the same in core principle, albeit with some changes. It feels a bit slower, heavier in a way.\nBut the most jarring part of it is the level design. Initially rather well done, soon you can't help but feel that they are too big for their own good. Hotline Miami is a concept that doesn't lend itself to large levels. Here's a list of problems that arrives with the large level format.\nThe levels become cluttered with all the gore, bodies, and guns. Easy to lose track of your enemies.\nCan't always see the entire way forward, even with shift-look it sometimes won't be enough.\nLarge chance to get shot offscreen by something you didn't see\nHere comes some story stuff.\nThe story in Hotline Miami 2 is a lot more developed than the first game, and has several links and returning characters. The barkeep from the first game was in the army with Jacket, Richter was caring for his mother and biker... Well.\nHotline Miami has several characters that it focuses on. The detective, who plays like Jacket except can shoot faster and aim faster with the shotgun, the Writer, who has a non-lethal style and allows for the combo to be kept up by picking up guns and unloading them,  but can go berserk if you kill two people. As well as the "fans", the very prominent group which has some unique playstyles, such as dual machineguns pointed in different directions, being able to dodge roll under enemy fire, instakilling fists and a duo of Swans with chainsaw and firearms.\n\nOne of the key components of the Hotline Miami series is the music, and it is delivered in spades on that front. The music far outmatches the first game which was also fantastic, and the soundtrack is in my opinion worth picking up.\n\nHotline Miami 2 is a hard game.\nAn unforgiving game, yet very forgiving at the same time.\nThe levels are long and large, but you can instantly respawn if you die, and you will die. A ton.\nYou will probably die a lot more in the second game than in the first one, the reaction time on enemies seems to have been reduced slightly and they can therefore react to you quicker. The most successful tactic so far is baiting out and taking your time with the enemies, as in some of the larger levels it is very, very hard to get a complete combo going.\nBut it is overall a compelling and certainly an unique experience, and if you liked the first game I'd recommend picking this one up too.\n\nMy favorite track is "Rust" by El Huervo. It kicks ♥♥♥.","March 11, 2015","true","26.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Quick, rapid paced, and brutally violent and unfair, where success comes through a combination of luck, dexterity, and just a bit of clairvoyance. Differences are in the details. Unlike the first game, Hotline Miami 2 follows several independent, yet intertwined storylines, each with a small selection of masks and abilities. In each level, only those in the active storyline have masks that can be used, as opposed to the original, where any mask, once unlocked, could be used in any level. Some new mask abilities include having two characters, one melee with one button and one shooting with another, to dual-wielding submachine guns and dodge rolling.\n\nThe weapon selection has expanded from the previous game to include a host of silenced weapons, SMGs, assualt rifles, and pistols. Melee weapon variety has been greatly decreased, being reduced, for the most part, to pipes, golf clubs, and knives.\n\nWhile the game play and music remain enviously good, the story aspect has suffered a bit. The lack of a single protagonist and the rapid jumping between storylines is, at times, confusing, and often the wild rampages seem a bit out of place. For many such rampages the reasons behind boil down to 'just because', something I'm kind of on the fence about as to whether it aids character development or is an excuse for more violence.\n\nAs in the first game, Hotline Miami 2's protagonists all invariably suffer due to their actions, leading to one hell of a finale. All in all, the game isn't bad at all. It's a bit rough around the edges at parts and can be brain-crushingly frustrating at others, but it's still fun and remains king of the kind of violence only Hotline Miami can do.","March 29","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kecksohn/recommended/274170/","kecksohn","W A H N S I N N","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kecksohn/","388 products in account","I've come to believe that 'Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number' might just be the best game ever created. Many ascribe that title to the likes of 'The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time', 'Batman Arkham City' or even 'The World Ends With You', however, those aren't nearly as astonishing as Wrong Number. Any major publisher can throw a pile of money at a development team, cater to the masses and market the hell out of it but to create something like Hotline Miami, even the first one, it takes true artists. When the latter released in 2012 Jonatan Söderström and Dennis Wedin created something completely unique and their own. No compromises were made to appeal to a wider crowd and everything in the game served a purpose and not just because it looked 'cool'.\n\nWhen you would be asking yourself why you have to mash the A button to open up a ventilation shaft in Arkham City (when we clearly agreed that this was shitty busywork which adds NOTHING to the experience of any work of art a decade ago), no one would ask a similar question when it comes to Hotline Miami. In a sense, Hotline Miami can be seen as a 'Gesamtkunstwerk', all of the elements (story, graphics, gameplay, soundtrack) strive for a greater goal than the sums of their parts. Without the story it could be written off as just another mass murder simulator, without the graphics and their effects it wouldn't have the same kind of feeling, the pixilated violence contributing a special bit (ha) overshadowing any childish bloodfest in 'Grand Theft Auto' or 'Metal Gear Solid', without the gameplay you wouldn't have the interactivity and immersion the story so desperately needs and without the soundtrack you wouldn't feel you heart pumping at every beat, wanting you to go on.\n\nIf the first game had already established the perfect formula, then why do we need a sequel? Because Hotline Miami had one major problem: It was only 2 hours long, when players were hardly fully satisfied (in fact it has been scientifically proven that it can take a lifetime of playing Hotline Miami for it to get boring) so the sequel made sure to include at least 7 hours of playtime, unlocking a hard mode for additional 15 afterwards. In addition, even though the first one had a near flawless story, OST and presentation, that didn't mean they couldn't be improved, so they turned them up to 11. All these improvements aside, Hotline Miami 2 also did a thing almost every other sequel is afraid to do (see Zelda for example): It picked the difficulty up right where the first one left off. With no thought spent on filthy 'newcomers' to the series feeling left out, Dennaton created exactly what they and their fans wanted and as most series should do, told everyone to play the first one or get fucked. It's just a shame that Deus Ex exists.","November 13, 2015","true","54.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If I had to complain about something for the sake of being a con, it would be the lack of choice in the levels in regards to masks compared to the first title. However, as a loyal gamer I found that aspect to be quite refreshing. It forced me to play by Dennations rules, not the ones I wanted for myself. It forced me to be a better player and understand the tricks and combos that have helped me scrape up the achievementsI proudly brag about.\n\nThanks Dennation and everyone involved in making yet another heart pounding mind bending game.","August 24, 2015","true","72.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Play the first one and then decide, honestly I think it's still better.\n\nHM2 carries over some of the charm we know and love from the first installment of the series but still makes slight changes in level design that change gameplay fundamentally.\n\nGoing 'Melee only' is a lot harder now than it used to be, as the game encourages guns and combos more than its predecessor.\n\nThe experience changes drastically because of this, as it makes the game a lot more strategic and tactical and gives up some of the flow I loved in the first game.\nOften times you will find enemies (with guns) far away from you and will die to situations that are simply impossible to survive without knowing what waits for you behind some long distances. These enemies will be impossible to kill without stopping or slowing down to press shift to look further out, which heavily influences flow.\n\nWithout giving anything away I can tell you that the story will now have you play a multitude of different characters which means that choosing a mask rarely happens at all and usually without a lot of variety. This isn't something I miss too much though, because the unique character designs really manage to make up for it.\n\nI'd say the game is inferior to the first one in very many ways, but that doesn't make it a bad game at all, considering just how amazing Hotline Miami was for most people who played it.\n\nThe story good enough and still manages to keep some of the 'what is happening?' confusion you might have felt during the first game alive.\n\n\n\nAll in all I would probably recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the first game. If you're sceptic, try to pick it up on sale.\nIf you feel like the first game lacked a bit of strategy, then there really isn't a whole lot for you to think about. Buy it.","September 21, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

This is that game. Now, I myself have never played the first one. If this is anything to go off of, I would say that the first is amazing. Now you might ask yourself, "Why should I get this game?" Well to that I say, "Allow me to tell you." First, I feel that this game is like crack. It is just addicting. I HAD to beat this game. I binged it until I did. Now, the game is not TOO long. If that isn't long enough, you can replay the story in a harder difficulty. This game also feel more retro, reminding me of some older games I haved played, (Which are way behind my time). This game also is very faced paced, making you think on your feet and how to react to a certain event. So, with all of this. "Do I recommend this game?"

Another mistake the devs make is that there are actually less weapons in this game than in the first, the "weapons on the ground" aspect was completley absent from the entire game wich is shoking because all it was was icing on top and was unnecissarily removed from the sequel. But despite all its flaws Hotline Miami 2 does get something very right, It feels like a Hotline game, every goon and gangster you kill feels awesome and even better than the first game. The story is also much more of a fleshed out experience this time around with characters developing (aside from the fans) and being shaped by their actions. I hate when people say oh "Its just more Hotline Miami" that could not be further from the truth. If your new to the series i wouldnt suggest you begin here, buy the first one and wait till this goes on sale.\n","April 6, 2015","true","159.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I will, however, mark them as spoilers. Just don't click on them even if you find it tempting, because everything under that is story related. Good? Good.\n\nThe first Hotline Miami was released back in 2012, and it became a large success, critics and fans alike praised it for its fast paced, adrenaline fueled ultraviolence to the catchy soundtrack made by several rather unkown but very talented artists, unlike most games which featured a single score made by one person.\nThe story in the first Hotline Miami was simplistic, and relied on more subtle means to tell its story. The main character never speaks, although there is dialogue in the game.\n\nThe gameplay consisted of fast dispatching of russian mobsters with various blunt weaponry such as a pool cue or a baseball bat, kitchen appliances, throwables such as bricks, darts, and glass bottles, as well as firearms.\nThe levels were rather small, enemies were in a reasonable distance from each other and it was all a very compact format, which lent itself rather well to its very melee-centric combat. You kill fast and die fast, one hit and everyone's out, unless you throw your weapon or punch them when not wearing a tiger mask.\n\nThe second game is the same in core principle, albeit with some changes. It feels a bit slower, heavier in a way.\nBut the most jarring part of it is the level design. Initially rather well done, soon you can't help but feel that they are too big for their own good. Hotline Miami is a concept that doesn't lend itself to large levels. Here's a list of problems that arrives with the large level format.\nThe levels become cluttered with all the gore, bodies, and guns. Easy to lose track of your enemies.\nCan't always see the entire way forward, even with shift-look it sometimes won't be enough.\nLarge chance to get shot offscreen by something you didn't see\nHere comes some story stuff.\nThe story in Hotline Miami 2 is a lot more developed than the first game, and has several links and returning characters. The barkeep from the first game was in the army with Jacket, Richter was caring for his mother and biker... Well.\nHotline Miami has several characters that it focuses on. The detective, who plays like Jacket except can shoot faster and aim faster with the shotgun, the Writer, who has a non-lethal style and allows for the combo to be kept up by picking up guns and unloading them,  but can go berserk if you kill two people. As well as the "fans", the very prominent group which has some unique playstyles, such as dual machineguns pointed in different directions, being able to dodge roll under enemy fire, instakilling fists and a duo of Swans with chainsaw and firearms.\n\nOne of the key components of the Hotline Miami series is the music, and it is delivered in spades on that front. The music far outmatches the first game which was also fantastic, and the soundtrack is in my opinion worth picking up.\n\nHotline Miami 2 is a hard game.\nAn unforgiving game, yet very forgiving at the same time.\nThe levels are long and large, but you can instantly respawn if you die, and you will die. A ton.\nYou will probably die a lot more in the second game than in the first one, the reaction time on enemies seems to have been reduced slightly and they can therefore react to you quicker. The most successful tactic so far is baiting out and taking your time with the enemies, as in some of the larger levels it is very, very hard to get a complete combo going.\nBut it is overall a compelling and certainly an unique experience, and if you liked the first game I'd recommend picking this one up too.\n\nMy favorite track is "Rust" by El Huervo. It kicks ♥♥♥.","March 11, 2015","true","26.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you don't, get it anyways because it will make you enjoy mass murder. Hotline Miami 2 turns brutal murder into a self-satisfying hobby that never gets old. Blowing people's brains out with a shotgun has never brought such an evil grin to my face; it is harmonizing, quick, and fluid. Once you get the hang of it, you never really let go - especially when there is an epic electro score to accompany your journey. Life in this game means little and you'll find yourself restarting lots. But don't get discouraged...because the restart button is part of the gameplay itself: you kill kill kill and die die die. There is a rhythm involved and it's what makes the game ever so obsessively addicting. But unlike addiction, you are rewarded progression for breaking the pattern you find yourself stuck in...the pattern that keeps getting you killed. In fact, it is dying that makes you want to take a risk and attempt something risky! And when you finally pull it off right, you feel like the king of the world! So go ahead, brave warriors, don't be afraid to restart or change up your ways, since this game will always have a road open to victory.","November 3, 2015","true","48.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Quick, rapid paced, and brutally violent and unfair, where success comes through a combination of luck, dexterity, and just a bit of clairvoyance. Differences are in the details. Unlike the first game, Hotline Miami 2 follows several independent, yet intertwined storylines, each with a small selection of masks and abilities. In each level, only those in the active storyline have masks that can be used, as opposed to the original, where any mask, once unlocked, could be used in any level. Some new mask abilities include having two characters, one melee with one button and one shooting with another, to dual-wielding submachine guns and dodge rolling.\n\nThe weapon selection has expanded from the previous game to include a host of silenced weapons, SMGs, assualt rifles, and pistols. Melee weapon variety has been greatly decreased, being reduced, for the most part, to pipes, golf clubs, and knives.\n\nWhile the game play and music remain enviously good, the story aspect has suffered a bit. The lack of a single protagonist and the rapid jumping between storylines is, at times, confusing, and often the wild rampages seem a bit out of place. For many such rampages the reasons behind boil down to 'just because', something I'm kind of on the fence about as to whether it aids character development or is an excuse for more violence.\n\nAs in the first game, Hotline Miami 2's protagonists all invariably suffer due to their actions, leading to one hell of a finale. All in all, the game isn't bad at all. It's a bit rough around the edges at parts and can be brain-crushingly frustrating at others, but it's still fun and remains king of the kind of violence only Hotline Miami can do.","March 29","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes there is still the fast music and the punishing combat, but all the anger of the original is gone and replaced by a mellow sadness. The cutscenes play slower more calming music, the narritive is more clear and focused. Every character in this game seems troubled, but unlike Jacket, more defeated than enraged. The combat, while it still keeps your pulse up, trys to be more strategic. Many users have complained about the designers use of windows, but i enjoy it. They aren't giving you what you want, they want to keep things unfair. I found myself planning my attacks more precisely than the first and i felt much more rewarded. The gameplay is still mostly unchanged, aside from the smaller collection of masks. Each mask is much more gameplay changing than any mask in the original game. The fans kept me entertained right up until their unfortunate demise. Overall what really defines this game is the music and storytelling. The combat is excellent as would be expected, but the music has much more diversity and style than the original. The soundtrack goes perfectly with the story to make moments feel more emotional. I found myself genuinely invested in the characters, hating some with my whole heart and loving others to death. In the end there is no happy ending. This world of death and violence simply cannot get one, perhaps it doesnt deserve one. However there is peace to the ending. The violence is over, the rush has faded, and like a long, hypnotic fever dream, it fades away. Goodbye Miami, your neon lights are gone for good, did you ever really find peace?
