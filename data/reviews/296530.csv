My impression is this is a "dungeon crawl (beyond incredibly) lite" for mobile.\n\nIt is not for a hardcore RPGer. It is definitely not for a PC gamer who is expecting the depth (whether story or mechanics) that comes from real PC RPGs.\n\nIF I played games on my phone (and I dont- I'm VERY anti mobile game, esp those ported to PC - See thread "i hope this is as good as it sounds" for why), and IF I was looking for an RPG to while away some time on the train or whatever, It'd be ok for that.\n\nDefinitely not a "suck away an entire weekend in dungeon crawling bliss" game though.\n\nOk for starters, yeah. The textures are really uninspired basic texture packs as Gwion noticed and Angelo pointed out. You could probably find the exact same pack on the web for purchase with a few words on google.\n\nThe story is...Meh. Thats not really surprising. The dungeon crawl genre isnt known for its stories, but for its intricate dungeons full of monsters and traps.\n\nYes theres 2 NPCS Ive met so far, an "innkeeper and a "shop". The story of why theyre there is beyond weak. And as far as I can tell, you cant buy or sell anything but arrows, rations, and fishing gear at the shop. Why even have a shop? Why not an arrow and rations vending machine?\n\nIt would have been served better to just have very little story, as Dungeon Master and LoG did. Just a "a big evil dungeon and you have to defeat the big evil at the end of it". That worked for the old games.\n\nBut in this one, your characters actually talk to each other sometimes. And the writing is bland and not really worth being there. The screenshots are misleading, as they show the charcaters talking to an NPC and each other.\n\nThe NPCs are dispensers, the writing of the charcater's speech sounds like it was written by a junior high schooler. NOT needed.\n\nThe thing that gets me more than anything is beyond a few screens of basic instruction (that any RPGer pretty much knows automatically) there is NO ingame helpfiles. NO tutorial, no nothing. And the ones you do get are impossible to look at once they're gone.\n\nSo you get basic self explanatory introduction (Minus what the "gestures" are - I still cant figure out how to strafe and it was only through experimentation that I figured out how to work them at all), and NOTHING about unique aspects of the game that you need to know.\n\nLike for instance in the character screen there is a yellow bar next to my health. Whats that? Experience? Fatigue? Food? No idea. Suppose Ive got to fiddle around with it till I figure it out.\n\nI'm all for not hand holding, but this game doesnt even tell you basic stuff you need to know.\n\nThat and theres no options screen. So I hope the resolution, graphics, keymap and sounds are to your liking. Cuz you CANT CHANGE THEM.\n\nThat might be OK for mobile, but on a PC it is an absolute necessity. Not everyone has the same configuration. Not everyone has hands that can use a keyboard to steer. (I have partial paralysis.)\n\nThe "gestures" are a good thing. I really like that as an alternate movement. But theres no tutorial of what to do to work them! It took an "aha" moment and 10 minutes of experimentation to figure out why my mouseclicks were spinning the PCs around.\n\nSo, in summary. This is a PC port of a mobile dungeon crawler. For mobile games that Ive seem, its pretty good. By the standards of the PC, no.\n\nGo play Legend of Grimrock or even the old Dungeon Master. If you like dungeon crawls and have an iWhatever, get this game on there. Then you can while away time in the waiting room or on the bus.\n\nBut I'd recommend actually playing real dungeon crawlers on the PC.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\n\nUninspired, run of the mill mobile dungeon crawler with non unique textures. Will not in any way shape or form impress a PC RPGer, but its worth poking at a bit if its on sale for $2 and youre really really hard up for a dungeon crawler. Way overpriced here though.\n\nThe lack of any sort of re-readable helpfiles, and not giving basic information about the game's mechanics really sucks. That and THERE IS NO OPTION MENU. That might fly on mobile. Not here.\n\nIf you have an iThing and want a dungeon crawl to waste time while waiting for the bus or whatever, get it on there. Its ok by the standards of mobile. Not by the standards of the PC.","May 10, 2014","false","7.6"," 187 of 225 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","187","225","0","1"

It's like some sort of a casual "Dungeon Master".\n\nOk there really isn't much depth to it but then again, I don't always want the depth of an epic game like "Dungeon Master" or "Eye of the Beholder". Sometimes this depth is just overhelming. This one here is easy to pick up and easy to lay away to play on later. It's fun. Really. Just don't expect it to be epic.\n\nApparently I find the graphics quite enjoyable and the sound is athmospheric enough for such a kind of a game. It all suits my taste really well. I like the spoken intro too. The voice over is professionally done, sounding good and clearly understandable. The game even has some nice touches (like eastereggs) to it, for e.g. the disk scratching sound when you're saving your game just like in good old Amiga days when playing from floppies. That's cool!\n\nGameplay wise it's a classic Dungeon Crawler through and through and there is everything in it you would expect from such a game: keys, doors, switches, levers, monsters, mazes, riddles, loot ...\n\nI must say it can't compete with the classics in any regards except the updated dungeon graphics but I think that wasn't the intention when creating this game either so rating it in it's own regards I can easily recommend it.\n\nThere are only one or two little letdowns for me in this game:\n\n1. The fighting is too slow. I guess this comes from being a mobile port. In this game here it's not possible to walk in a backward circle around strong enemies hitting them from the side while evading their attacks. (I think classic Dungeon Crawler players know what I mean ... ;). In fact it is somewhat possible but too unreliable and waaay to slow, it gets boring to do it but it's not necessary either because your magic characters have literally unlimited mp so you just stand still in front of the enemy and heal your party all the time. Not nice but it works. Only I liked the more action oriented version from classic games more.\n\n2. Speaking of fighting: Daggers can't be thrown, either can't arrows - you need a bow to be able to shoot the arrows. Again the fact that the party as a whole is using arrows from the same pool makes the game even more casual. No micromanagement here. And I think you can't sell items, and probalby there will ever be three items to buy in the shop the whole game through ... You could see this all as a positive though as it makes the game more casual ...\n\nAs I said before this game can't compete with the classics (my personal favourite still being the underrated and mostly forgotten "Black Crypt" for Amiga) but that's okay for me ...\n\nMaybe it should be priced a little lower, like 4,99 €, but when it's on discount and you're looking for a nice snack of oldschool dungeon crawling you can get quite a lot of fun out of it. If you did like games like this in the old days chances are high this game here sends you right down memory lane. And it does it in a nice and easy package.\n\n@ngel","September 29, 2014","true","18.2"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","33","37","0","3"

It is obvious the game was made with the intention of having to swipe fingers across the screen rather than use a keyboard. There is only one save slot for every party you make, so if you manage to pull levers in the wrong order in a puzzle and get yourself stuck, you're done. That's what happened to me about 80% into the game and after that I felt there is no point to start a new game. However, aside it being slightly broken, this game did manage to take 7 hours of my life, that I have kind of enjoyed.\n\nIn the case of this game, a line between recommended and not is very thin, but I decided that the unforgiveness of the game to do the puzzles in a different way than it has imagined it being done is unforgiving. That tipped me over to say No, skip this title. However, if you are REALLY into these types of games, you might still want to get it.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGraphics: 7 / 10\nPleasing to the eye, exciting. Few quite really nice touches to the levels.\n\nSounds: 6 / 10\nNeat menu music, decent ingame sound effects for the most part. I felt as if the reading speed at the start was too slow.\n\nStory: 6.5 / 10\nQuite basic in fact, but enjoying regardless. Slow progressing.\n\nHUD and controls: 4 / 10\nHUD itself feels slightly crowded.  What you see in the screenshots of the game is the HUD if you play with non-traditional settings. This mean that game will try to act as it is still kind of being played on your touchscreen device in a way that it will allow you to turn around by clicking and dragging your mouse instead of swiping your fingers.\nThis however can get annoying as you have to click on the items, walls or objects to interact and may sometimes turn instead of doing that.\nUpon switching to traditional settings, your character will not turn around randomly because of your mouse, but your hud will receive about 8 new buttons on it that give you an option to use them instead to turn. This is totally obsolete in a PC game where you use a keyboard to navigate. The game will also not bother teaching you some of the controls required for moving on with the game (Tab, you're welcome).\n\nFun factor: 6 / 10\n\nPossibility to get stuck at random times: -1 off the overall rating","January 30, 2015","false","7.6"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

I've seen other games that were ported from the mobile market that did fantastically, so that's not my major malfunction.\n\nWhat I do take issue with are these things:\n-You can't sell anything at the one shop - you're forced to depend entirely on the gold you've collected to buy things, and just dump your old equipment you replaced on the ground. For players like me, that drives me up the wall.\n\n-No settings. At all. Nothing. SO WHEN THE GAME IS BLASTING YOU WITH MUSIC WHEN YOU FIRST OPEN IT, YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE VOLUME MIXER IN WINDOWS TO LOWER IT.\n\n-The puzzles are stupid easy, like you would have to have some serious mental problem (or just be really stupid*) to not understand them. I expected at least a small challenge, and was disappointed.\n\n-There's no help area at all. You get the tutorial windows popping up at the first part of the game, and that's it. There's also no Index, Compendium of Knowledge, whatever-you-want-to-call-it for getting to know the classes while in the game- what weapons and armor they use, etc.\n\n-I'd also expect an RPG to have something like a Monster Index, where you can see information about monsters you've killed, but I've played RPGs without 'em, so that's more of a want, not a complaint.\n\n-That big blue guy. I don't like him.\n\n\nIf you're looking for a good dungeon crawler, I'd recommend you look elsewhere.\n\n*"Really ADD" joke removed because someone got butthurt and i'd rather not deal with people with no sense of humor.

However, it greatly annoys me for one big reason: It's a quintessential mobile game, in every way.\n\nI have nothing against mobile games in general, but the entire mobile game market is FLOODED with carbon-copies and even copy-pasted games. Try to count all the match-3 Bejeweled clones in the App Store, and you will go insane. Try to find all the Flappy Bird clones in the Google Play Store, and your family/friends will have to stage an intervention.\n\nThis game is no exception. It is nothing but a slightly-dumbed-down mobile version of Legend of Grimrock, full-stop.\n\nThe graphics are good-looking (not within a stone's throw of LoG though), and the character art is pretty fantastic, but movement feels like LoG (albeit clunky and restrictive), secret buttons feel like LoG (with far less imagination), puzzles are similar to LoG (albeit not clever, and RIDICULOUSLY simple), and combat feels like LoG (albeit stripped to its most basic).\n\nNow, to be fair, Legend of Grimrock was far from groundbreaking in the dungeon-crawling genre to begin with, but in a world where Legend of Grimrock exists (and has workshop support!), why would you play a game that is almost exactly the same (or worse) in every way?\n\nLegend of Grimrock felt mysterious, and alive, and it had a distinctive dark and brooding atmosphere. The puzzles were incredibly clever, bordering on diabolical, and combat was tough but rewarding. This game, however, feels bright, friendly, and... I hate to say it... casual. Combat is slow and boring, puzzles are insultingly easy, and the whole thing feels like it's catering to 15 minute playsessions.\n\nI've barely put any time into this one, and I can't see myself putting more in. With LoG, rather, I got in trouble for putting off work to play it.\n\nIf you ABSOLUTELY LOVED Grimrock, have played all the high-quality workshop content, and are utterly dying for more dungeon-crawling, it might be worth waiting for this to go on sale. Myself, however? I'm deleting it and moving on. There are far too many excellent games in my backlog for me to spend time replaying a detuned version of one I already beat.","August 10, 2014","false","0.5"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","2"

If you can't get actual voice actors to speak the dialogue don't put the entire conversation in text form for people to read through. Some of the conversations (the first one with the inn keeper for example) are increadably long and boring and I found it pretty annoying to have to click through all of it.\nI don't think the "puzzles" in this game really go with the turn based style of movement either (as in moving and stopping over and over again like you're moving spaces on a game board). I found it especially annoying when I had to fiddle around with those weird color wheels because after I would switch it to a different color I would have to search the entire area to see if anything changed and nothing did change I would have to go all the way back. Because of the turn-based movement it went about ten times longer then it should have.\nI also think the tutorials could be a little more specific, specifically in the realm of combat. I kid you not it probably took me 15 minutes to figure out how to attack something because all the tutorial says is that you can click the attack button to attack the enemy in front of you, it never tells you that you need to fiddle around with the characters to equip their weapons and armor.\nOne last thing that I felt kind of annoyed by was the part with the weird ice giant thing that you had to kite around the enitire freaking room for your reward because if you got within it's attack radius it would pretty much kill one of your characters instantly. Once again, because of the turn-based movement, kiting hime around that massive loop took FOREVER and, in the end, all I got for my trouble was a suit of leather armor. I was so close to just quiting the game then and there but I felt like I hadn't given the game a fair chance yet because that part's pretty early on in the game.","December 27, 2014","false","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Its all the features of an old fashioned dungeon crawler, and the graphics my not be "up to par" but who cares! The game is really good and almost directly revives the genre along with the legend of grimrock. The game starts off quite slow but once you start exploring and getting better gear the gameplay speeds up and you'll be finding more secerets and solving cool puzzels. This game is defiantly not a waste of time and is a great game considering its only four dollars. Most people give this game a bad name because its not another call of duty or battle field clone and it doesn't have guns or really a main objective. Many people won't enjoy this if they want a next gen game or what ever, just give it a chance and if you don't like it just remeber...It was four dollars its not like it was sixty or some stupid price like that.","April 3, 2015","true","2.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

When I say hard, I mean the controls and interaction with the game is challenging. Items that can be picked up with a single mouse-click got really hard as I move around the item just so that I can get an angle just close enough to pick it up. That's the only glitch I found in this game.\n\nNow for the good stuff. The visuals of this game is really nice and pleasant. The standard dungeon raiding game but with an active-turn based RPG type of feel, this game can actually be addicting. Other limitations to the standard gaming would be the ability to teleport back to town is limited to the number of... whatever that glow red floor panels were. Then the ability to revive can only be done via Altars only which makes this game even more challenging in saving your team from getting annihilated .\n\nOther parts of the gameplay, is that this game is really meant for mobile and not for desktop gaming. The controls were not really my style to play this sort of game but it still utilizes the WASD standard.\n\nNothing much about the Audio.

Early on you'll notice that much of the game's features (or lack thereof) are clearly designed for tablet/smart phone use, which includes annoying things like clicking drop down menus to select gear for your party, or all spells having the same generic 'caster' icon with different text for what the spell is, but with no details about what they do like their damage ranges or other effects. Using your mouse to look for secret switches will also move your party -much quicker than using the standard WSAD keys at times, which gets very irksome.\n\nThe game still has plenty of very low-level bugs which you wouldn't expect for many games even in a beta status, with visual combat glitches being the most obvious even from early on.\n\nOverall I'd say the game just isn't designed for a PC gamer audience, and if you're really looking for a similar game that wont dissapoint, go check out Legend of Grimrock.","July 6, 2014","false","0.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

You play as 4x different characters in a turn-based RPG.  When a character's attack cooldown is ready, you click on the character's attack icon in order to perform an attack or spell.  My preference would be to be able to select auto-attack for my additional (non main) characters, and to simply play the main character.  The greatest difficulties are in simply controlling the party's movement - the keys are awkward and there is no mouse look.  And while movement and attacks are frustrating, the game would be playable and enjoyable if not simply for the fact that the player is often left with no idea what is required to be done next.\n\nI wandered about in circles for hours trying to figure out what I was supposed to do next.  I couldn't reach the key I needed, and there were no switches left, nor rock piles to search.

I expected it to look like a mobile game.\n\nThe controls are slow and clunky.  You are often waiting for whatever time cycle to pass before you can enter another command.  Sure, the pauses are generally small, but the frustration adds up.  Plus, the default swipe movements are always there, so you can end up accidentally moving while trying to activate levers or pick up objects.\n\nYou can use the 1-4 keys to make attacks, an improvement on Legend of Grimrock which is click only, but half of the default party are spell casters and there are no keyboard shortcuts for spells.\n\nAnd if you accidentally cast a spell with no possible target?  You're still stuck waiting for everyone to return to "idle" state so you can move again.\n\nYou also start with almost no equipment.  You can pick up a few items laying around an intro area, but when the first fight arrived only half my party had weapons.  By the time everyone was wiped out by some golem thing, my shaman had yet to find a weapon and so all they could do was cast Heal and twiddle their thumbs.\n\nThere is also the inane conversation between the party members.  It's better than talking to the two crazy ladies who run an inn and a shop in a dungeon, but that isn't really saying much.\n\nYet despite all the time spent on text and conversation, there are other areas that are blatantly ignored when it comes to prose.  For instance, the areas you enter and teleport to/from are things like "2a" and "1".  It just struck me as odd.  There is also no real explanation of what game items are and how they work.  Why do I have rations?  No idea.  Why can't the shaman wield a staff?  No clue.\n\nAll in all, this game just isn't worth $5.","March 14, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
