"http://steamcommunity.com/id/epilexia/recommended/377600/","epilexia","Epilexia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/epilexia/","691 products in account","Tcheco is like an obscure japanese cult classic for the NES, never released in the United States before, and whose only psychical copy is sold in eBay for 20000$, that has finally comes to Steam as the plattformer response to Super Amazing Wagon Adventure\nMaybe you haven’t heard the name of Marcelo Barbosa	before. But if you are some type of indie game enthusiast like me, you have probably seen some of his previous works. Because he is the animator of some of the most iconic videogame trailers in recent memory, like those created for Oniken, Porcunipine or Odallus. Sure, if you are brazilian you probably already know his name, as he is a reputed animator in his country of origin. And the creator of one of the greatest underground animation series in the form of Tcheco. That serves as an inspiration for this love letter to japanese most obscure Famicom classics.\n\nWith Tcheco being Barbosa’s first attempt as a programmer and a game designer, I’m really impressed. Because he has created a new standard. A game that will be compared with any future attempt doing in trying to replicate the characteristic look of the NES original hardware.\n\nNone other contemporary neo-retro game looks and feels so close to a NES real hardware as Tcheco. And none other game has understood so well some of the design premises of japanese most beloved classics, even in subtle and almost insignificant aspects related to its sound construction.\n\nFor years another brazilian neo-retro creation, Oniken, has been used as the standard and most evident example to talk about NES looking inspired games. But Tcheco is an incredible leap forward respect to Oniken.\n\nOne of the aspects on which Tcheco truly shines in its attempt of recreating a NES original hardware, is in its almost perfect CRT simulation. In the past, we have seen a lot of games trying to mimic the look of the old fat televisions using modern LCD panels. But a lot of times, seems as the developers had never seen a game running in a real vintage television. With too much accented horizontal lines and overdramatized special effects ruining the experience.\n\nUntil Tcheco, none other title has managed to achieve this perfect recreation of an old fat TV. It’s so close to the original experience that it’s practically impossible to see any differences in its scanlines reproduction.\n\nI think that in the coming years, to be able to find old fat TVs in the second hand market for play old retro titles with its same original look will become a very difficult task. And then, a lot of new generations will probably ask themselves how the early 2D titles looks. When this moment comes, you will only need to show them Tcheco running on a modern LCD monitor. As the better way to explain them how was the real look of the first pixel art creations.\n\nTcheco not only does a perfect work in its visual representation of a NES hardware. Also feels like a classic japanese title thanks to its use of sound. With distinctive effects that are inserted under a classic Nintendo premise of trying to immerse the player in each single action that occurs in the game universe through organic reactions caused by joyful sound stimuli. An use of sound that is also successful in its intent of create a unconscious motivation in the player to continue exploring the game universe. You can think in the pleasant sound used in the first The Legend of Zelda when you hit an enemy with your sword. Tchecho has the same Koji Kondo way of conceiving the sound design.\n\nBut Tcheco is much more than a NES hardware imitation. It’s like the re-imagination of a lost and forgotten hidden gem that reaches decades later the status of classic thanks to internet. And I think that the nostalgic factor doesn’t have any real importance to judge Tcheco. Because its insanely very well drawn graphics assets are atemporal. So, Tcheco would be an amazing title 30 years ago. It’s a captivating beautiful title with a distinctive universe now in 2015. And within 20 years, Tcheco will be still remembered thanks to the love and perfectionism put in every single detail. With every single screen being an almost different universe, with different animations, enemies and background layouts. An impressive artistic work that is full of ambition for a solo game developer.\n\nNote that you should expect a recreation of the NES period games also in its mechanics. With no checkpoints, a risky step that is compensated thanks to a perfect managed difficulty curve. Like in the NES old classics, you will need to repeat every single screen in each play, while you improve your skills and learn the game obstacles. This sense of realization of improving our abilities with each losing attempt.\n\nBut maybe the best thing in Tcheco is that it’s not an imitation of a standard NES classic, and don’t even try to rivalice with established classics like Castlevania or Super Mario Bros despite its multiple and subtle homages to past titles. The greatest thing in Tcheco, I think, is that is intentionally bizarre in a pleasant Wario Ware style.\n\nTcheco is like a forgotten 80s gem that was so advanced, quirk and original for this age that it never was released in the United States. It constantly looks in the mirror of another NES renowned hidden gems like Ufouria the Saga. Because Tcheco really tries to be a contemporary Monster Party. Or a never released Zombie Nation.\n\nAnd inspired by the joyful spirit of Super Amazing Wagon Adventure, every single situation in Tcheco is always new. Its capacity to astonish the player with new and comical situations never ceases. It constantly invents new mechanics and puzzle designs.\n\nBecause Tcheco takes every second into consideration, drawing a perpetual smile in our faces.\n\n\n( The writer of this review is not an English native.

Any Brazilian knew from the first second it was a hoax, a prank to turn offenses against a soccer commentator into a trending topic on Twitter. The truth eventually came out, but one question still remains: why would anyone spend a lot of time to make a professional documentary for no other reason than fooling people with an innocent joke? And why does it sound so reasonable for any Brazilian to do so?\n\nThe answer is: zuêra (aka zoeira).\n\nThing is, it's impossible to translate "zuêra" properly. But after you play this hilarious game, keeping in mind that it's based on the adventures of a cartoon character that was shown on public TV for no money at all and was made by the same guy who's now basically giving this game away for free just so that you and me can have a good laugh, maybe you'll begin to understand what it means. A domestic dog blowing fire is zuêra; references to "forte gomba" are zuêra; a random appearence of Frankenstein is zuêra; flying giant babys are zuêra. And so it goes.\n\nIf you still don't get it, your last shot would be paying a visit to Brazil. Make sure you have Internet access and, most important, someone to guide you among the huge waves of zuêra.\n\n10/10","June 29, 2015","true","5.9"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","88","23","26","10","0"

This makes me happy. 10/10\n\nBut for serious, this is a cute little game a definitely worth the money. Now quick disclaimer - I, having spent the majority of my childhood living in the 2000's, am not one to be prone to retro game nostalgia, despite enjoying games with similar format to games from the 80's years later.\n\n"Tcheco in the Castle of Lucio" is a 2D platformer, in which the objective is to collect the key on each screen in order to open the door to the next. It sounds simple, but there are no respawns, and you have only one life (with multiple hitpoints). This means playing the game over and over, each time improving a little, and making it further than before, which may sound tedious and frustrating, but actually leads to a great sense of accomplishment once progress is made.\n\nThe graphics remain faithful to the NES style it attempts to replicate. The music sounds similarly authentic, and each melody is upbeat and enjoyable. The controls are pretty fluid, personally I believe working better with a controller. Fortunately this game does indeed have full controller support, although I've yet to try it with a 3rd party gamepad (only used an Xbox controller). There's no options menu as such in the game, and windowed mode plus additional resolutions would be nice.\n\nOverall, cheap game, fun. Give it a go. 7/10","June 22, 2015","true","3.4"," 36 of 54 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","36","54","2","1"

Tcheco's adventure takes the player through a ton of "one screen"-scenarios that can be small puzzles or simple reaction-tests. Thanks to the often bizarre nature of the things going on, I quickly got very curious what WACKY SHENANIGANS will happen next and I was surprised how motivating that actually can be. This game is crazy and crazy-fun.\n\nAnd it emulates the "feel" of actual old games pretty well, it's simplistic and easy to understand but at the same time it is HARD AS BALLS. Collision-detection can be wonky at times, but even if it was flawless the games difficulty is nothing to scoff at. The downside of this is a lot of repetition - you will replay the beginning of the game A LOT. This can be somewhat frustrating, once figured out - the early rooms are kinda boring and take too long. Checkpoints or passwords might have helped, but there are supposedly warpzones in the game - that might fix this problem.\n\nHowever, beating a ton of rooms without taking a hit and thus being able to venture deeper into the Castle of Lucio sure is motivating, as is (finally) figuring out how to beat screens that gave you much trouble early on. But only true masters in the RetroArts that got on-point execution and are good at memorizing will see the end the legit way, thanks to rare health pickups and no continues.\n\nBut considering it's less than a buck, I will not complain about the brutal difficulty that much - if anything, this will add to the replay-value and I will absolutely return to "Tcheco in the Castle of Lucio" until I have beaten it (with the help of a warpzone... and 30 lives). If you want a colorful, crazy, oldschool-flavored and quite challenging game - you could do a lot worse than join Tcheco on his adventure in the Castle of Lucio.

It'd be a little like this! Every new screen has a quite unique new idea behind it, and it often challenges what you know about platform games. Not everything is as it appears, and there's usually a puzzle to get through the room which will surprise you. Great stuff!\n\nThe only downside is that the game is at a fixed resolution, with mandatory scanlines over the top. I get it - the CRT arcade feel - but I've never liked when games do this, and usually they have the option to turn it off and see the pixel art. It does have a pretty cool feel, but scanlines mean nothing to people like myself from PAL territories, where CRT TVs have more lines and therefore the scanlnies weren't visible.","January 3","true","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You need to meticulously remember every pattern in every room to succeed.  And sometimes I felt like some of the hits I sustained were cheap.  Sometimes I could nail a pattern, taking no hits, and then, for what I thought I was doing the same thing, resulted in a hit.\n\nSo again, no checkpoints (for at least as much as I played), so this isn't a full recommendation, but I still had fun.\n","May 29","true","0.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's about as simple as you could ask for, play-wise - you can only run and jump, and that's all you need to do to grab a floating key on each screen and move on to the next one. There are various enemies and obstacles in your way, of course, but despite their varied nature they exist to frustrate you above all else: it's frequently difficult to tell which onscreen elements will hurt you at a glance, and unclear which background pieces you can jump on until you take a leap of faith. You can take a fair number of hits before dying, but you only get one life and energy refills are scarce, so expect frequent trips back to the very beginning as you execute the necessary trial-and-error banging of one's head against a wall until you figure the nastier parts out.\n\nI can appreciate the game's efforts to recall the 8-bit days in terms of both presentation and challenge (and its cheap asking price too), but losing precious life points due to design uncertainty and nickel-and-diming hit detection over and over again just doesn't make me eager to see this one through to the end. I certainly can't say I lost a huge amount of time or money on Tcheco, but I also can't say I enjoyed what I did experience of it, and thus can't recommend it to others either.","October 15, 2015","false","0.7"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","1"
