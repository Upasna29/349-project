For 15 dollars this game damn well worth it, with beautiful visual, great soundtrack, small story but good, nice side background notes to read, great gameplay with a lot of variation in terms of play styles, and so much more. The game is also extremely challenging, even the non-boss enemies (aka trash mobs) are hard to deal with, and they aren't just 'tough' they dodge, block, parry, and strike when necessary, they sometimes even gang-beat you. One cool thing the game has is that you can control all creatures you encounter if you're higher level than them and if you used a certain special attack so that you can collect their soul and transform into them, and each creature/character have their own attacks and play styles which is really awesome. Also the local versus mode (4-players) is great, choose any character you want in the game (assuming you unlocked it in the campaign) and duke it out with your friends.\n\nThe bad about the game is that the controls are sluggish when turning your character's direction from right to left or vice versa, which to some might annoy very much, but can be coped with and just have patience when doing so. The game also features campaign coop, but for me it's not fun as friendly-fire is enabled and there is no option to turn it off, and because of this i (or my friend) find my self doing most of the killing or not doing anything while my friend does the killing to prevent any of us from getting damaged and lose health, and because of this it's hard to recommend to play the game in coop mode. Unless the patch it to disable friendly-fire.\n\nTo sum it up, it's an amazing game that's high quality, brutal, full of content, and high replay value. With randomly generated levels, great combat, and a lot of characters to play from with different play styles. Plus the extra versus mode and coop mode (that will hopefully have an option to disable friendly-fire). It's hard not to recommend this game for the asking price, unless you don't like hard games.\n\nUPDATE: There is now an option to turn off friendly-fire. so my recommendation of this game went up from 80% to 90% . Coop is now fun to play.","July 14, 2014","true","22.5"," 248 of 289 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","248","289","0","4"

The game soundtrack is amazing, the art is pretty damn good, the story is equally interesting. All in all, it would be a perfect game, BUT! Yes, there is always a but!\n\nThis game suffers from a fatal flaw that makes people dislike this game, and personally, it doesn't really bother me, at least before nightmare mode.\n\nThis game suffers from INCREDIBLY awkward controls. You character feels heavy, your moves slightly powerless, jumping is such a pain in the ♥♥♥, it would be perfect if the combat was slightly faster in pace, and the movement wasn't that clunky, but this game is stiff as all hell. I do not like games where you can easily reach a combo of 100 without any kind of effort, but in this game, no matter how hard I try (I might suck, too), I can BARELY pull a 10 hit combo.\n\nI enjoyed this game a lot, and it's always nice and addictive to level up and go down the levels of the abyss, like a dungeon crawler game, and the clunky controls, as I said, aren't much of a problem UNTIL you reach nightmare mode, and enemies gangbang you while you can barely do 4 hit combos. I don't mind stiff controls, but most of the people out there who want a fluid, fast paced adventure beat 'em up....I wouldn't recommend it.","March 23, 2015","false","23.1"," 260 of 348 people (75%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","75","260","348","13","7"

As Katrien, Pincoya, or the Ghost Monk, you must brave the depths, fight countless abominations, and end the Warlock's demonic nightmares. This is a rather unique game, with its combination of rogue-like elements, fighting game mechanics, and semi-cooperative play.\n\nThere are three paths available, though the player can sometimes detour into either of the other paths. This may be necessary to access special events such as boss-fights, arenas, and meetings with strange individuals. The bosses are self-explanatory, but the arenas put you in control of a random adversary. One of the selling points of this game is that nearly everyone you fight is playable, and they all have their own move-sets. Completing these arenas restores your character's HP and grants them a summon. Think of it as a third life-bar, which is necessary because healing opportunities are few and far between in the Abyss. If your heroine (or hero) is wiped out, a random soldier will take their place. If he dies, it's all over (unless you spent a checkpoint token), but he can revive the main characters if he uncovers a shrine.\n\nThe combat is a bit tricky to get used to, and starting players shouldn't even think of touching the nightmare mode. My advice is to play defensively, but don't just sit around blocking. There's a lot of maneuvering in this game, and you'll find yourself fighting just for a better position. In short, you want to push your enemies against the wall so you can easily juggle them to death. As a fighting game, AO features standard attacks like anti-airs, pokes, dash-attacks, and so on. Coming to grips with everything will take practice, as you can't really approach this title like Street Fighter, Smash Bros. or even Mortal Kombat. It shares elements of all those games, but it does its own thing with them, which might be offputting to some. Keep in mind also that stage layouts can change the way a fight plays out. Expect to be outnumbered 4 to 1, or dealing with traps while fighting. Something as simple as a platform or a wall can change things dramatically.\n\nAside from danger, the Abyss is also home to a number of merchants and treasures. Gold can be spent to buy equipment and healing items, though good luck ever finding something you actually need. The main characters can also level-up, which provide very slight stat-boosts. Experience and gold are persistent through every odyssey, however once you die you lose everything else.\n\nWhile there is a standard Versus mode, typically your interactions with other players will be semi-cooperative. I say semi because AO is one of the rare games where players can hurt each other. An option was recently added to turn this off, which is nice, but I guess the developers aren't particularly fond of its inclusion. This design-decision was employed so that players simply don't spam moves all the time and trivialize fights. When playing with a friend (or a complete stranger) you have to time your attacks, fight nearby opponents, or even "tag-in" during prolonged fights if one player is low on health. All that said, turning off friendly-fire doesn't affect anything aside from one of the achievements, and it's a pain to get since it involves playing through nightmare mode (more aggressive AI, bosses tend to have assistants, etc).\n\nIt's safe to say that Abyss Odyssey, isn't for everyone. Yes I know that is one of the most overused descriptions on the planet, but it definitely applies here. The fighting system can appear wonky and random, it gets frustrating when you can't land a hit for anything,  and what's with every game having rogue-like elements? Maybe I want to keep my stuff when I die! Ever thought of that!? But...whatever. I can't promise anything, but this game is good enough for me.","January 13, 2015","true","15.1"," 66 of 72 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","66","72","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/255070/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2818 products in account","Abyss Odyssey is a platforming action rogue-like type game released in mid 2014 on PC and consoles, although sadly there are only approximately 70k owners of this game on Steam\n\nYou play as Katrien as you try and stop a Warlock who is at the bottom of an abyss. The warlock's dreams are infecting reality and must be stopped!\n\nThe gameplay is very simple. You have a number of different attacks which you can also unlock and upgrade their abilities and power through leveling up. You also have a number of a different spells which again can be improved by spending talent points in them.  There is also a block/parry system in the game; however I had very little need to use them even on the harder stages.\n\nThe combat system is very easy to grasp. It follows the same sort of system as beat'em up games and you can quite easily pull of a couple of cool combos.  Throughout the game; there are also shops in which you can purchase equipment and weapons, these offer special effects such as being able to charm an enemy to fight on your side, which is something a little different to add some variety to your gameplay. The art is actually based on the Nouveau movement.\n\nThe graphics are standard 2D style, but the art style is beautiful; it sets the mood and the atmosphere is perfectly portrayed through the art.  The backgrounds on each level are gorgeous, even though most of them look dark and deathy (is that a word ?). Speaking of the levels; they are all procedural generated; no playthrough will ever be the same which adds tons of replay ability to this type of game. There are three stages of difficulty to each level, Easy, Normal and Hard. You are able to tell which difficulty each stage is by using the map system in the game which easily shows you a path you take, and maybe if you want to readjust your course to skip a few hard stages, you can.\n\nAfter you finish one playthrough, you unlock a different set of levels; however there seems to be a community based unlock system in the game too; once a certain number of players defeat final bosses on each stage, the next phase of the game unlocks which is something I've not seen before apart from in MMOs.\n\nRoguelikes are one of my favorite genre's of games; this has the feature of not actually resetting you completely after you die, you get to keep your gold in order to buy weapons/equipment on your next run through, you also stay the same level, meaning you can grind out a few levels and then eventually you'll be able to take down the final boss.\n\nI managed to complete a couple of playthroughs in the two and a half hours I have been playing so far; and I am still enjoying it thoroughly; this kind of feels a little bit like Risk of Rain, while although not as complex, it still has feel to it with the equipment side of things.\n\nThe game needs to be played with a controller; don't even attempt to play it with your keyboard.\n\nI can easily recommend Abyss Odyssey; I will certainly be keeping it installed on my PC for the odd jump in every now and again. Rogue-like fans will love it.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

This is a Beat em up / rogue like with some RPG elements. You decend down levels each having a merchant and a "potential" save point at the end. you find weapons as you decend deeper but it looks like the majority of your items will be bought. when you die you get a much weaker hero that carries your weapon and any keys you dropped when you died and if he makes it to the end of the level your original hero gets ressurected.\n\nIf you decide to quit without saving which costs 9000 gold for a save token you start from the top of the tower but your hero level and gold stay with you but you lose all items. So it seems you need to run this a few times without buying any equipment so you can save for good stuff to beat it. I decended about 1/2 way down the tower in an hour so it seems to have a game length of binding of issac but a much better equipment/money system.\n\nPros\n\nGraphics - pretty cool graphics style.\n\nLevels and money earned dont disapear - makes it feel like your not starting from scratch when you quit or die.\n\nCo-Op - playing with your friends should be fun\n\nLooks like there are lots of heros to unlock to add to the replayability factor\n\n\nCons\n\nSave Token - For people that dont play for more than a few hours at a time you have to spend a decent amount of gold to save your progress down the tower, so if you cant play for more than an hour or two at a time you might want to think hard about getting this.\n\nControls - Right now Configurations for controllers except the 360 controller are buggy (my Logitech F710 doesnt work right) the keyboard and mouse controlls are doable but not recomended. So unless you have a Xbox 360 controller I would wait a few for a patch.\n\nOver all the game is good , I just think it needs a little fine tuning. for the sale price of 9.99 im happy with it. full price of 15 bucks should be worth it once the problems are fixed.","July 15, 2014","true","4.3"," 114 of 153 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","114","153","0","4"

Seems like everyone agrees something is not right but they can't quite put their fingers on it. "Feels heavy" some say, "jumping is awkward" others say. So I bought it out of curiosity! Before buying the game I even had a theory about the jump profile, but my theory was wrong.\n\nI find the movements ok. Nothing particularly good or bad about it. It's functional. Grabbing ledges can be annoying at times though. The combat, with all honesty, is actually pretty damn good! I was shocked and surprised by it, judging by my low expectations. I am not sure why the poor reviews focus on that aspect. Maybe people went in expecting something alike Dust: An Elysian Tail, which has a very fluid and easy fighting mechanics. You can just mash the buttons in different ways and there's always a new combo there. But Abyss Odyssey is a completely different deal. Combat is extremely tactical, your movements are not instantaneous and you are not invulnerable while attacking, so you have to plan when to attack, watch your timing, be aware of other enemies around you, use defense correctly, use evasion etc etc. It reminds me a lot of Dark Souls actually. Not so unforgiving, fortunately, but the pacing is similar and it also requires focus and skill.\n\nI still haven't finished the game, and some reviews made sure to point out that the game becomes unforgivable during the nightmare modes (each level has a random difficulty level). So I might change my recommendation if these modes are bad enough to make me dislike the game altogether.\n\nSo I find the combat good and the controls ok, what else? Yeah, the rest of the game is not successfully engaging me I'm afraid. First time I played I died pretty quickly, but the second time went on forever! I was starting to get tired and I wanted to stop playing the game but I never died, I just kept going and going and going. The environments are all too similar and the gameplay doesn't change in any way. I find the progression very tedious so far. Probably (this is me just guessing now) the game lacks more gameplay elements. There is platforming, but it's trivial challenge, and the controls wouldn't even support more than that. I'm thinking it needs sections with a slower pace, so we can catch our breath, look at the scenery, absorb some of the story, solve a couple of puzzles. I'm digressing now though.\n\nThis is my recommendation with a handful of salt (instead of a pinch, get it?). It's an interesting thing this game, I'm glad I bought it, even if I lose interest before finishing it.","September 9, 2015","true","3.0"," 73 of 93 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","73","93","4","2"

The game looks like it would be so fun, if only you could hit back; just getting your character to face the right direction is a chore.

The ability to play as all the characters you fought by capturing their souls was appealing, and I was thinking there would be many characters to unlock and many abilities to master.\n\nBut 'unlocking' a character means capturing its soul and using the character at least once because you never get to start or customize any except for the 3 that you're allowed to start a dungeon with.  And then the captured soul character is basically just a damage sponge as you explore the abyss.\n\nThat being said, the combat is decent.  Attacks flow into one another nicely and it's easy to get an intuitive sense of combat motion.  However movement during combat is extremely clunky due to you only being able to walk unless you have an ability that includes a running start.  And most enemies have good weapons reach so jumping is fairly pointless unless you're facing something on four legs that you can't just use dodge to avoid.\n\nThe construction of the dungeons themselves are extremely linear which makes them rather boring.  They're never technically identical, but they're all basically the same.  Once you've finished your first run top to bottom of the abyss, there really isn't anything surprising that gets thrown at you.\n\nI enjoy rogue games generally, but this one just doesn't leave any rewards at the end of your trip and doesn't give you anything to work for.  You enter a room, kill 2 things, then explore the map until you run into another 2 things that need to be killed.  Do this for 15 minutes aaaand boss fight.  Repeat until you win. Then repeat the whole cycle until the monotony breaks the game for you.","July 26, 2014","false","9.7"," 52 of 68 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","52","68","0","0"

It's Bad Dudes NES bad.  Turning to face the other direction is a chore and moves spend more time finishing animations than they do starting them.  Essentially, you're vulnerable whenever actual strategy is required, which means the only way to progress is to stay out of the action and spam cheap shots.  This lack of engagement is only compounded by the limited number of attacks available.  Not only is the combat unengaging, it is extremely reptitive.\n\nThe only thing that stops the game from being completely unplayable is that the AI is tuned to be moronic.  This may be incidental, as the enemies are also designed to be player characters.  Either way, they're adding nothing to the combat experience, other than cheap shots when you're facing the wrong direction.\n\nI want to like this game, it's got many creative notions and the presentation is fantastic, but it's just not fun to play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aetrym/recommended/255070/","Aetrym","Aetrym","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aetrym/","166 products in account","I'd like to break the game down for you in this review. I'm gonna talk about the combat mechanics, the visuals, and the various features that make it stand out as a platformer/fighting game. When reading about this game you see it compared to Super Smash Brothers, Dark Souls, ect. The truth is that with its combined features, Abyss Odyssey does not at all play like any of the games anyone is comparing it to. So, in an effort to give you a realistic perspective of what you can expect in this game, lets get started.\n\nThe first thing to open up is the combat. The combat in Abyss Odyssey seems to be difficult for some people to grasp and understand without playing -and it is difficult. you have several moves at your disposal...\n\nLight attack - This is the basic one-two punch for most characters. a light attack can be performed stationary to perform a one-two combo, or while moving forward to deliver a leading blow. Light attacks can also be executed in the air, and you are able to direct them up, down, left, right, and neutral (no direction).\n\nSpecial attack - this attack behaves differently than the standard attack. while playing as a main character, you will unlock their special attacks over time. Each special attack behaves differently, and characters each have a completely unique moveset. Special attacks are performed by pressing the special attack button combined with up, down, left and right. Performing a neutral special attack will simply execute the left/right attack in the direction you are facing. Special attacks can be performed in air, and the only directions you can attack with them are the direction the animation sends you. (often a special attack is a lunge, dive, fireball, projectile, and will typically propel you in some direction, though every move is different.)\n\nGuard - Blocking works like you would expect. Holding the block will bring up a "shield" displayed as a circular Chilean art design, which will protect you form some ammount of damage before shattering. after shattering, it will be unusable for some time, and the decorative circle turns bright red for all to see. To parry one must simply block the attack "at the right time" there is no way to gauge this timing other than to learn it naturally by playing.\n\nCancel points - this is really all there is left to talk about for the combat, and its the most important part! Cancel points allow you to chain your moves together to create unique combos. Unlike Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, you create the combos yourself -There is no premade list of garbled button controls to refer to. This said, cancel points were the hardest concept of Abyss Odyssey for me to learn however, once I did I became able to beat the game in about an hour.\n\nThere are several different ways to cancel, but lets define cancel for this game first. A cancel is a method of "move interuption," meaning you will be interupting your attacks before they finish...with either a special attack, or dodge. So read that last part again if you are totally confused by this. Here's an example of how this works:\n\nYou perform a light attack, almost immediately after the attack, you can activate your up special attack, which will cause a brief flash of light to indicate you have used a cancel point, followed immediately by your up special attack. You can take this even farther, by activating a different special attack just after your last one, and chain them together. You can do this up to three times, and then it will require a cooldown. the cooldown is only in effect if you arent dodgeing or attacking for 0.5 seconds. You can also cancel with dodges. This allows for fluid attack patterns.\n\nWhew, now that all thats done lets go on to talk about the visual style and qualities of Abyss Odyssey. All of Abyss Odysseys undergound generated levels is themed after a vibrant jungle, a glacial cavern, a graveyard, fire, that sort of thing. they all look marvelous, and you'll always have something pretty to look at, whether its the detailed characters, (with maybe the exception of the wraith -has always looked like kind of a lazy character model/concept to me. Still my main though.) or the lush backgrounds.\n\nNow, I don't know too much about Chilean art style, or really what it attempts to model itself after, but I'll say this. The designs that show up in the game are clearly a labor of love. The sheer ammount of detail that comes along with this style is overwhelming -not to mention is something completely fresh. I mean, all of a sudden I'm learning about chilean folklore and all the weird, crazy monsters this world has to offer. It provides a new atmosphere for losing yourself in, and those that explore the Warlocks journal will be even further immersed in a well-written backstory of the warlocks life and the reason for the various monsters in the abyss. My favorite part about the story is that its unique. In a world where game narrative is becoming suprisingly boring and blurred together, its always welcome when someone provides a fresh story.\n\nNow I just wanna list some cool various features of this game and then go play it so...\n\nUnlockable characters - there are only 3 main characters, but the real fun is collecting all the monster souls. each character can transform into, and capture enemy souls enabling them to take their form, and moveset. The enemy souls are important because they have their own hp bar you can use to soak up damage before laying waste with your main character. to capture one, all you have to do is hit the enemy with your capture attack (a large blue orb that appears in front of you that does DoT) and then kill it. Your chance to capture the enemy monster goes up with your level.\n\nHard - Look, I didn't say it much in the review because its a major selling point for the game, but I REALLY like the difficulty level of this game. It throws out the hand-holding, the tutorial levels, the handicaps, and just drops you in to the conflict. What some fail to realize is that its this lack of information when begining a game that creates the mystique of the continuity. The less we know going in, the more reason we have to keep playing to discover the world.\n\n2 player coop, 4 player battle - yep, this ones coming to a couch near you. You have the ability to unlock every character in the game (with the exception of spiders, fish, and other enviornment enemies.)\n\nCons - There are some bugs here and there, and any major complaints about the design or mechanics of the game are likely to be met with "we're just a small indie team." But I hope we don't forget that these small teams are much more willing to break mainstream game design concepts. And speaking objectively, the AO team is really making the community part of the game. The entire concept of this game is based on the community working together to beat the Warlocks nightmare. I'm really excited to see how it turns out.\n\nHonestly, this game needs a demo like everyone else is saying. the combat is just not for everyone. It takes time to learn, but not much if you play videogames regularly. Thats the end!","July 17, 2014","true","25.5"," 35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","35","42","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/255070/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The first thing I took heed of was the developer’s nationality; ACE Team went and did the brave thing to actually utilize Chile’s history to set the context of our adventure. It’s 1890, hot dogs had just been proposed in the mid-west of North America, the term “World War” didn’t yet bore middle school students to death and Michael Bay hasn’t destroyed Transformers yet. It’s an age ripe for exploration and happiness! That is, until someone starts having bad dreams.\n\nSo, in a twist to complicate the incipient Chilean civil war, ACE Team decides to literally drop a hole in the middle of a city street called the Abyss, where evil spirits and monsters spew from. Brave soldiers race to bottom, thinking to find the source of this disaster only to meet certain doom at the hands of the lurking monstrosities. In this time of dire need, a heroine appears, brandishing a beautiful rapier and with the determination to beat any foe. She assists the soldiers against their new enemy and is then promptly squished flat under falling debris.\n\nThen she comes back to life! She’s Katrien, an apparition of the Abyss on a seemingly endless struggle to end the evil curse by stopping the Warlock, a dark mage whose haunting nightmares are the reason this whole mess has happened. No, the story isn’t anything fancy or anything to dally on for a long time, but at least it’s simple to understand and sets your main goal as early as the tutorial. Abyss Odyssey counts with a procedurally generated dungeon which changes every time you die, although each “Area” basically consists of the same deal: sections are blocked off until you defeat baddies, boxes containing a bit of loot here and there, an altar where you may raise a check point and merchants and secret areas.\n\nWith this kind of filling, all you have to look forwards to in each new Area is perhaps a change of scenery and a new soundtrack to match the landscape. The music is one of the things I simultaneously like and dislike about the game. It is good and composed with meaning to set the mood but sadly, the music is too low key in contrast to sound effects. Sometimes, like in the brimstone area, you can’t even hear it. Every bit of the dialogue in the game is spoken, giving the player authentic performance to fill in the narrative, so that adds to the charm.\n\nWe’ll find ourselves side-scrolling in each Area, fighting with combos using a weapon of choice, facing enemies with finely crafted AI and a variety of different move-sets. This an important thing to note: Every enemy is allowed to pull off any tech you might, like double jumping, climbing, animation-canceling, blocking and parrying. In addition to this, every enemy counts with their own arsenal of abilities that can devastate you in the blink of an eye if you’re not paying attention.\n\nAnother feature this game counts with is the monster capture ability. Filling your mana bar by using magical attacks  enables a powerful one-time attack that can be unleashed on enemies. In addition to its powerful damage output, this attack will paint monsters with a lower level than the character blue, and upon defeat these monsters will drop their souls. Soul items can transform into monsters at any time during the game, letting you play a different character as an extra gaming experience. This is a very useful yet limited gimmick that effectively gives you an “extra life” since the death of the monster avatar does not mean death for your character, you are instead transformed back to normal.\n\nPulling off specific tasks such as defeating bosses in your journey will sometimes reward you with extra skills you can freely equip on your character, allowing players a certain degree of character customization. Leveling up not only increases HP and damage dealt and bolsters defense, this is hard to judge without seeing non-health and offensive stats, but existing skills are improved every three levels which adds a sense of progression. Transforming into creatures sometimes modifies stats depending on the enemy type. Items can be used by any character as long as they are equipped. Precious gold is gained through the descent in the Abyss and can be given to merchants in exchange for new equipment or checkpoint tokens.\n\nOnly when reaching the bottom will we finally see what the fuss is all about. At the end of the Abyss is the Warlock responsible for the mess in Chile. Defeating him grants the same sense of closure as in any other rogue-like, so be prepared to go down the Abyss over and over and over again to fight him! Abyss Odyssey is a simple and enjoyable game. That is, if you have patience for its learning curve!","November 7, 2015","true","27.4"," 43 of 57 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","43","57","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apsalar54/recommended/255070/","apsalar54","Apsalar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apsalar54/","1935 products in account",""You are not wrong, who deem that my days have been a dream...All that we see or seem, is but a dream within a dream." - Edgar Allan Poe\nI'll start with a quick breakdown of the common gameplay paradigms found in Abyss Odyssey so you understand the basic structure from which the game's extraordinary dream poetry is built.  Furthermore, Steam tagging can obfuscate a game's nature as easily as it can enumerate it, so I generally find it helpful to reconcile the competing descriptions.\n\n"Battle is an orgy of disorder." -George S. Patton\n\nAt its heart Abyss Odyssey is a brawler.  As in any other brawler the player moves through discrete play fields ("rooms") attempting to beat the crap out of, well, everyone.  Control is simple to pick up though as you continue to play new vistas of subtleties and complexities to be mastered reveal themselves.  Again, like most other brawlers, the game is built to be played with a controller (in fact, a controller is so crucial to this game that it's a condition of my recommendation).  One button is basic attack, one button is special attack (also called "light" and "heavy"), and there's jump and block and dodge etc etc- and then there are conditional controls for things like npc interaction.  The conformity with tradition makes combat feel intuitive and the controls are extremely tight and responsive.\n\nThen why, you ask, am I getting repeatedly slaughtered by crowds of ridiculously skilled and clever enemies, in what looks and feels like "an orgy of disorder"?\n\nI have two things to say to that. First, in addition to being a brawler, AOd is a roguelite.  You will die repeatedly but take solace in the fact that your characters will keep their levels and gold (but not their items) for the next run. The rooms, enemies, loot, etc, are all proceduraly generated from a limited set of predetermined allowable variable combinations. So don't worry about the map too much. Besides, once you get your skills right, a run from start to final boss on normal only takes a few hours (and doesn't "end" the game).\n\nSecond, what appears to be chaos is in fact highly refined technique moving very quickly.  You'll notice that pressing different directions and using different timing even just with your basic attacks will result in an enormous variety of moves.  Your enemies have just as many, and they know how to use them.  They are clever.  If you stand there blocking waiting for them to come to you they won't.  They will either try to get around behind your back and grapple you or they will wait for a comrade with a guard break move to arrive so they can all hack you to pieces as a team as soon as you are exposed. They also will not fall for the same combo more than once or twice, then if you try it again they'll find exploits. What often appears as chaos is actually your enemies coordinating their attacks for best effect. The maps are always different, the enemy combinations are always different...eventually you'll need to think on your toes and be creative about your brawl.\n\nIn some ways it's comparable to a very very fast, 2D Dark Souls: every battle has the potential to be fatal. And once I started to get the patterns and the flow of the controls I had that same familiar Dark Souls feeling- that I lost because of human error, but it's in my ability to win.\n\n“I dream. Sometimes I think that's the only right thing to do.” - Haruki Murakami\n\n"Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake up in the day to find it was vanity, but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act their dreams with open eyes, to make it possible.” - T.E. Lawrence\nThe setting of AOd is a vaguely Brazilian early 19th century city under which a great...abyss...has opened.  Deep down at the very bottom of the pit a mysterious warlock conjures strange shifting realms filled with nightmare creatures.  In fact, it slowly becomes apparent that the abyss is indeed a figment of the warlock's dreams...and perhaps you are too. After all, how else do you explain the elusiveness of your own death?\n\nI call it a setting rather than a plot because evoking a fundamentally poetic context for the game is evidently far more important than providing a traditional storyline.  If you are looking for a coherent plot arc with a tidy bow, you'll have to look elsewhere.  But the poetry! The game drips on the one hand with the heady unease, even terror, of that moment before you're able to seperate the dream from the waking day.  And on the other hand, it oozes the narcotic stupor that always accompanies the most ornate dream-nonsense.\n\nThe character design is a perfect fit for the setting- beautifully hand-drawn and styled after the posters and ads of the French Post-Impressionists of the 1890s (think Toulouse-Lautrec) but augmented with a far richer and deeper color palette.  The levels are lush and overwrought, depicting feelings and sensations more accurately than places and materials.\n\nI'll stop here before this becomes a master's thesis.  I hope it's clear by now that I have added this game to my list of games that offer very strong evidence for my assertion that video games are a legitimate and important literary medium.\n\nHighly recommended.  But this game is hard, and...eccentric.  A lot of the early criticism came from mistaken expectations about its paradigms.  But it's also really beautiful and poetic.  Most importantly, it's quality work that is both engaging and enjoyable.\n\nEDIT: I realized rewatching my video I should probably mention the enemy soul capturing mechanic.  There are 3 main playable characters (1 start, 2 unlock) but if your level is far enough above theirs you can capture the soul of any enemy in the game. Once you've captured a particular creature that soul will occasionally appear for sale at shops. At any time you can only hold one soul, but you can take its form at will.  The soul-form has its own lifebar and the soul is yours until you drop it or its life is fully depleted.  If your main character dies, besotted soldiers will give their lives in an attempt to reach an altar and revive you.  So in most cases you effectively have three life bars to go through before game over.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=506817422\n\nNo Drama, Just Reviews","August 26, 2015","true","8.6"," 89 of 138 people (64%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","64","89","138","6","1"

(Explained in review and comments).\n-Closest comparison: Rogue Legacy is way better.\n[/tl;dr ]\n\nI was super hyped for this game, i hyped myself with the idea of a beautiful platform figher procedurally generated.\nThat was until i finally got it and regret.\n\nFor easier reading i will try to put this in bullet points:\n\n-Enemies sometimes attack instantly without any kind of telegraph, your health chip down slowly every enemy you fight.\n-Enemies also defend attacks instantly, the grab move to break defenses requires proximity but impossible to execute because AI is frantic and react instantly.\n-Making my best combat strategy was EXPLOITING AI on ledges and walls. They cannot execute more than one action sometimes when climbing ledges, and walls prevent knockback so i can attack and stunlock most enemies besides the big ones that are immune to staggering.\n-One of the things i most hate on all games is animation locking, every action you start you are locked until it finishes.\n\n-The music, sometimes i hear 2 or 3 musics at the same time, so i stopped to analise and 1 of 3 was actually the skeleton guitar dude. the other 2 was actually only one music, good music but sounds like there are someone completely lost on the music background.\n\n-Double jump sucks, the crazy spinning animation is just odd, also misleading, when i double jump and see the whole character above the platform i think i made it but actually the hitbox did not, the then i fall back down.\n\n-When collecting gold from breaking jars a big load of coins explode from them, but actually just a few coins are collectable, most of it are just particles, this is nitpicking but is a little disorienting and freaking annoying.\n\n-When i die the "lost items but keeping gold system" is bad, this basically makes the player to grind for gold, the buy equipment all at once like "this run is all in".\n-I didn't played enough but seems that level is also kept between lives, same problem, grind for exp.\n\nThis last part can be easily compared to Rogue Legacy. Actually this whole game can be compared to Rogue Legacy. But the thing is that Rogue Legacy is way better than Abyss Odyssey.\n\nThe game is good and beautiful, but negative points are multiplicative for me, individual points weren't too bad but them all together just made me rage.","May 1, 2015","false","2.7"," 88 of 149 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","88","149","2","13"

It feels very much rogue like, with a simi-perma death. Upgrades can be kept each life (Like your level/HP/skill tree and Gold) however you may not keep your weapons, souls gotten from enemies and keys for unlocking chests and doors. Luckily there is quite a few ways to get all of these items as well as shops around each stage for you to buy these along with HP vials and Camp Tokens. Camp Tokens allow you to come back to the spot you've placed it if you were to die. Very good for newer players wanting to save their progress. However, I found myself never using them.\n\n\nThe art style is pleasing to the eyes and pulls you in at times. Aside from the "cut scenes" being sometimes choppy and somewhat a downgrade to the standard gameplay look, it's passable. This game has a very fun style to it and it actually allows for two player co-op, KB&M with a controller or a mixture of the two; however I found that online co-op was really slow, quite buggy and not a whole lot of worth in it. I've connected to people close by and hosted myself yet it doesn't seem like it helped any. There is online PVP as well, which still has a bit of lag and buggy in nature. It's still quite fun regardless of the prior said.\n\n\nThe story was not interesting at all really, however that didn't stop my enjoyment.

It is a fairly short game to beat; you'll probably be able to beat it in 5-12 hours depending on your skill, but it has a lot of replay value, thanks to the very compelling combat system, and the polish and brooding, odd atmosphere and lore are compelling enough to make me want to replay this game often. If there are any flaws to point out, it's how the enemy and boss design can be a bit lacking sometimes. I think that the final boss's arena is too small for it to be entirely fair, and that some of the other bosses can seemingly devolve into grab and dodge for inexperienced players over and over, and some attacks need hyper armour, but up until you master the fairly deep combat system ), you won't notice that anyways. This is a game where I'm willing to acknowledge its flaws, and be okay with them, because the game as a whole is so great. An atmospheric, minimalistic 2D dungeon crawler with a deep, robust and rewarding combat system, amazing real-world and folklore inspiration and a great backstory behind everything which I won't spoil; but if you like the sad backstories behind games like Dark Souls and Majora's Mask, you'll love this game's lore.\n\nHighly reccommended.\n\nEDIT: Also the versus mode is actually amazing and shows off how good the combat system is.

It's colorful, pleasant to look at and the animations are nothing short of great. You won't get tired of listening to the music either. Although the design of the enemies is not the best There isn't much else to really say about it\n\nThe story is really interesting, it seems like it is a twist on a story from the 1890's but I wouldn't know. For me it was really unique and the presentation of the whole thing is one of the things that kept me really interested although it had a rather abrupt ending that leaves little to no closure but aside from that the game being roguelike, the respawns, the monsters and pretty much everything is explained by the nature of the story. They all mix together rather nicely. There's some decent voice acting as well. Don't expect anything great from the soldiers but what little lines the other characters have are nice.\n\nThe combat... Here is what a lot of people have a problem with. I personally think it's because they go into the game expecting something else. The game includes 3 characters, 2 of which are unlockable. One fast character, one slow heavy hitter and one with a crazy reach.\nYou can have up to 3 specials with each character and there are 5 in total for each one.  You can bind each special to whichever direction you want, front, up or down(that's how the normal attacks work as well).\nThe combat system is based around cancels. Canceling your current move / animation to do a fast combo, canceling from normal to special to dodge etc. You can have up to 3 cancel points which act like stamina. There's also a block and grab button, the grab ignores the enemy block. You can upgrade specials with up to 3 different traits. One for defence, extra damage and mana regeneration. When the mana bar is full you can do a seal attack and the enemies you hit will be marked. If you defeat them in time and if you are on the same level as them you can capture them and turn into them. Here is where the game shines the most for me. Each and every enemy you encounter, bosses included, is playable each with their own skillset. It's amazing and there's a decent enemy variety.\nI personally love all of it. The mechanics are robust and the controls are responsive.\n\nThe AI. So when you first play this game you will get your butt kicked in and you will be so frustrated you will want to punch a hole through your monitor. Fear not, it does get better, although you will have to read a couple of guides. This should never be the case but the tutorial and in-game guide are not good at all. There IS a trainning mode where you can experiment at your own pace though.\nSo anyway the AI will seem really unfair at first. It will seem like they are reacting based on what button you just pressed but it really is just AI done right. With time you will get better and you will feel good about overpowering it. Some people though give up from the first hour and write a negative review on steam :lol:\n\nThe platforming. There's a certain degree of challenge to be found in the platforming elements as well. Lots of traps which you can use in your advantage in fights as well. The procedural generation is done really well. With most dead ends leading to trasure / check points and sometimes secret "doors".\n\nSo the actual bad of the game which is not a lot but is important.\nThe multiplayer. Now there are 2 modes. The coop and the fighting mode which acts as a regural fighting game with each person having 2 characters. That mode works as intended for the most part but the coop is buggy as hell. If you actually manage to get through the connection lost errors you will encounter the following:\nYour character level resetting to lvl 1. Don't worry it's only for the game session (not working as intended)\nKnocked down and not being able to get up.\nA looooot of lag.\nSHARED CAMERA. IT'S GREAT WHEN YOU FALL IN A PIT AND YOU CAN'T SEE WHERE YOU ARE (working as intended)\nAt least there's local coop as well... Plug in a second controller and play with a friend of yours.\nAlso the game comes with it's fair share of crashes. Mainly when you alt tab and tab back in but it's not a big deal.\n\nAll in all this game is great aside from the coop mode. Which will turn a lot of people away. Worth full price if you don't mind the multiplayer and definitly on a sale.

The game combat feels just a bit clunky sometimes and the hitbox a bit off at times and looking past that, the Abyss Odyssey has something to offer for those who wants some 2d/3d platforming rpg game with rogue-like elements with co-op included.\n\nThe game starts you off playing as one of the 3 main characters (Ghost monk is my favorite). Wielding a sabre Katrien who is part of a warlocks dream is who you'll start your game off with, your goal is to reach the heart of the abyss and defeat him. You'll encounter mostly blue soldiers npcs, sellers that you can pick a fight with, and singing skeletons along your way some of the wierd and unique npcs you'll meet with fully voiced and well done dialogues. You'll be able to explore and Collect money,potions, weapons and keys to access certain chests. There are tons of content to unlock and secrets to discover while traveling down the abyss\nIf you die in the game a soldier will take over your place where you'll have to find the ressurection altar before you really die and lose all your items causing you to restart the abyss. The abyss is an ever changing dungeon with random difficulties so each time you play or enter the dungeon it is always changing bringing the rogue-like element to the table.\n\nThe gameplay itself offers some interesting fighting game mechanic from double jumping, 2 hit combos, ground recovery, special cancels into combos, blocks, dodge, and parries. The game also has an rpg system in place so that you can modify your weapons and items you have on your character, you'll also be able to customize your moves the way you want and even add enhancement to them when you acquire skill points enabaling more damage. There is also a capture system in place where you can capture your enemies and use thier powers becoming the enemies itself. Each of the enemy type themselves offers completely different move sets and abilities that will aid you, along with thier strength and weaknesses.\n\n\nWhile the game is very interesting and unique the controls of the character itself felt very wonky, I didn't like the initial keyboard set up so I ended up plugging in my controller, It is possible to play with Keyboard and mouse but the game feels much better on a controller perhaps preference here. Either way the character movements in the game felt clunky at times and the enemies look like they are much smoother than me. The hitboxes seems to be off at times because I remember hitting enemies at certain times and having them walk past my hits easily hopefully these issues can be fixable.\nThe coop itself is a pretty cool idea because it lets you play along with a friend, there isn't an online arena and the only thing that bugged me from playing coop is the FRIENDLY FIRE, which someone can easily join your game just to troll you out ruining your gameplay if you leave your game public.\n\n+ The game is challenging depending on the path you take, quite brutal at certain areas. Choose Carefully\n+ 3 main characters, over 30 enemies you can capture or buy to become each with thier very own combat elements.\n+ Interesting mix of gameplay, fighting game mechanic with most of those elements combined into a 2d action platformer\n+ Rogue-like dungeons, it's always changing\n+ The music is good and fits each area really well\n+ Voice overs for ever character adds immersion\n+ Beautiful art and backdrops\n+ Rpg elements will keep you optimizing your gear\n+ Mix and match combos + skill system\n\n- Controls felt kinda wonky, moving the character just did not feel very smooth\n-hitboxes are off at time.\n- Combining combos are fun when ya get them, but the initial combos itself isn't too interesting, sub par at best and felt that way.\n- Friendly fire during coop is dumb, the first person who came in started attacking me so I ended up attacking him back until he was dead. It should be a choice\n- VS MODE IS LAN ONLY, WHY ISNT THIS MODE ONLINE!?  =(","July 15, 2014","true","4.4"," 38 of 62 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","38","62","0","3"

Unfortunately, the controls were unplayable for me. There's some sort of weird issue with the keyboard and mouse controls for the game that make jumping really difficult in the game. Pretty consistently I wasn't able to do a forward jump in the game unless I was already moving at full tilt. I could understand if this was some sort of intentional design, but this made it impossible for me to advance through the game once I was a couple levels in. I tried in vain for 5 minutes to double jump and grab a ledge that was mandatory to proceed through the level and wasn't able to do it.\n\nUnfortunately, this was a gamebreaker for me and rendered the game unplayable.\n\nI've tried using a gamepad with the game, to see if the controls worked better there, but I and many other people were having issues with our 3rd party controllers for the game. So, I tried to play off of keyboard and mouse, and hit the problem above.\n\nWhat little I played seemed like a great game, but unfortunately, I'm done with it, and I can't recommend you buy it either.

It's got a pretty amazing art style, with a good amount of enemy and boss variety.  You start out with one character in the campaign, and can earn two more for campaign mode.  Some say it is too easy, personally I disagree though part of that could be that I use a keyboard and mouse and they have a controller.  They recently added a higher difficulty level however (along with online co-op and other features), so that shouldn't be much of a problem now.\n\nThis game has two particularly unique things going for it.  The first is that you can capture your enemies souls (even bosses) and that will make them playable both in the Training Room and in Versus.  The second thing, is that over time you can earn new special skills and choose which ones you like (three on a character at once), as well as upgrade them with various bonuses.\n\nThe story is kinda cool too, with influence from Chilean mythology and also being set in Chile.  I should also note that they have continually updated the game as the community progresses together to "break the seals" by defeating the end boss.  Definitely worth playing.\n\n"And I am vengeance, here to strip your power away." -Ghost Monk","July 17, 2014","true","8.6"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"

I have to say though, I'm disappointed. For what appears to be a 2D beat-em-up, the combat is extremely slow. There are only a few combos, and the delay after each is frustratingly long. I will say that the art style is very unique, the music is great, and I appreciate some of the rogue-like aspects of this game, but the combat, being the core mechanic, just feels way too slow for me to properly enjoy it.\n\nIt's not just that it's slow, mind you. There can be slow paced gameplay that's done really well, but enemies tend to take a while to kill, and sometimes feel like they can easily get more hits in than I can to them, or that there are just too many of them for only being able to attack as much as I can. In addition, I don't feel very mobile while I'm playing this. I don't expect to be speeding through this game, but games like Rogue Legacy or Ascendant, similar 2D roguelikes, make me feel much faster and make the game more bearable in comparison.  There are hardly any mobile attacks either, leaving you standing in place for most attacks. In the end, as much as my character is supposed to be some type of experienced swordswoman, I just don't feel like I am while playing as her. If you're used to either of the two games mentioned before, or even something like Super Smash Bros., you will likely be disappointed with the combat system.\n\nIf you're not convinced, I implore you to at least look at the videos, and I mean really look at them (the first few moments of the second video show it pretty well). If you don't care about the combat (there is quite a bit), then by all means get it for the art, music, and rogue-like elements. But if you really want a roguelike with a fun combat system, I suggest looking elsewhere.","October 14, 2014","false","0.8"," 31 of 51 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","31","51","0","2"

After about 4 hours of singleplayer and co-op gameplay decided to wright a review as the game itself is really controversial.\n\nLet me start with some sad moments. After first 15 minutes of the gameplay I regretted the money spent on this game...\n\n-There were no any training or introduction in the start so I had to check the controls, combos, etc. and to find out how everything works in this game using that training mode with a dummy (probably it is this way only for PC version as on youtube I have seen a prologue as a training mission on xbox).\n\n-The control in this game appeared to be not very smooth for a 2d platformer as I've expected. Sometimes it just drives me up a wall, expecially jumps and character rotation.\n\n-I've tried to play with gamepad and keybord and unfortunately I liked the latter more, as for my gamepad not all the functions were available (like skills upgrade, just can't understand which button should I push to get the sub menu).\n\n-I've tried co-op with my bro and found out that co-op is pretty buggy here. Sometimes characters just stuck and do not react to anything, for example after resurection on the altar.\n\nThat is all bad sides so far, maybe just IMHO, but still. I think more will be revealed later.\n\nBut now when I have already looked closer into the game I'd like to say that the game is not bad, I even liked it.\n\n-First of all it looks just wonderful to me, I mean graph and art, atmosphere\n\n-It is not quite easy (especially taking into account control issues)\n\n-Co-op is still fun with its friendly fire enabled\n\n-Decent music\n\nI would like to add that the deeper you get into the game the more positive sides appear. It is not a typical 2d platformer where you can win by hitting 1-2 buttons and you may gladly spend several hours in the game mastering your skill. But ptobably after those several hours most people will get bored as the gameplay is not diverse.\n\nAnyway I will recommend to try this game to anyone who enjoys platformer/fighting/dungeon-crowler sort of games.

I love the character designs and level backgrounds so much. The soul capture mechanic is great as well, as you can literally capture the soul of any enemy in the game - as long as your level is high enough - and assume control over them, giving you an entirely different move set as well as an extra life, since your character doesn't die when the controlled creature dies. The roguelike elements in this aren't too strong because you keep your level and the gold you collected upon death, but the stages and loot are randomly generated.\n\nWhat I do want to elaborate on, are the controls and combat. Most of the negative reviews mention solely that the combat is broken and the controls are bad, which to me really isn't the case. This will probably sound elitist, but I feel like anyone saying the combat is broken and cheap just hasn't gotten good enough at it, doesn't want to get good enough at it or has never played fighting games a lot. The combat just takes practice and getting used to, and I personally really like this combat and its learning curve. This game takes a lot of inspiration from the combat of Super Smash Bros., one of the most beloved fighting game franchises which also harbors a learning curve. How can people adore Smash but hate on this game's combat, when they're identical in quite some ways? It even has i-frame upgrades on specific attacks which can be used very tactfully and there is also a button to cancel your move/combo, which is one of the most important mechanics to master to do well in this game. Most of the negative comments on the combat and controls do come from people who have played the game for around one hour, maybe two tops. So that just makes my first points that much more valid.\n\nI definitely also don't agree with people saying that button mashing is rewarded or that memorizing one or two overpowered combos will get you through the game, because I find myself playing very differently against different enemies. A specific powerful combo against one enemy could be horrible against another depending on what attacks they have and how quickly they can interrupt you and such, because they WILL take advantage of any openings in your attacks. Learning your enemy's attacks is probably even more important than learning your own attacks, just like in any decent fighting game.\n\nThis game definitely deserves a chance if you are up for taking your time to learn the game and not jumping in and complaining about it being bad, when it really is you not wanting to learn the mechanics.","May 18","true","20.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I must admit that when I decided to purchase the game, there was a little bit of worry coming alongside my purchase, but once I began playing, all my worries were gone. Abyss Odyssey is a game perfect for anyone seeking a challenge. After playing the game for a while I began to try to dig into the combat system to just be impressed over and over again with how interesting it is.\n\nThe combat in this game has a similar feel to it as Smash Bros. Abyss Odyssey is not as loose at Smash, but the way you move and attack are similar. As you progress down deeper and fight you will level up your character and find alternate attacks you can equip to expand on your potential. Depending on what kind of skills you equip, you'll expand your combo potential and/or give yourself benifits such as more ranged attacks.\n\nI feel the need to stress that if you're not interested in games that will push you and challenge you, this game is not for you. If you want a game that will reward you with feeling like you really accomplished something worthwhile, then you need this game in your library.\n\nI don't like to rate games on a number scale because I don't believe that can be accurate, so I would rather inform you on what the game has to offer instead of trying to sell you on buying it regardless of your type of game.\n\nThe player type I would recommend this game to is one who desires a difficult game with high reward in term of accomplishment. A player who is more into disecting a game to play it at its fullest potential will enjoy this game. A player who is interested in jumping in and just fighting without interest in mastery of the game will not get as much out of the game.","May 1","true","13.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/255070/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Abyss Odyssey exists at this weird crossroads between art nouveau stylings, Smash Bros mechanics, and roguelike design. It's a potent mix that you never fully get used to, one of those rare indie games that feels incredibly indie no matter how long you play it. Perhaps even more remarkable is the way these elements harmonize to form something not just unique, but entertaining as well.\n\nIt's the close of the 19th century and something nasty is happening under the streets of Santiago, Chile. You get dumped into the world as the absolutely drop-dead gorgeous Katrien, a hardy swordswoman who is refreshingly up-front about her mysterious origins. There's a warlock slumbering deep beneath the surface, and his nightmares are becoming reality. To put a stop to it, you descend through a randomly-generated network of caves, collect gold, weapons, and items, and defeat a bizarre host of monsters on your way to end the warlock once and for all.\n\nThe way this plays out is in a long series of short levels that are light on platforming and heavy on beat-em-upping. Comparisons to Smash Bros are not lazy, because this game uses the same facing systems, same jump mechanics, and it even has a sort of Smash button for special moves. If you ever played the story mode in SSB Brawl, this will feel very familiar. Monsters range from jaunty skeletons to deer people to flying regalia, and the bosses that you sometimes run across are some of the most unique I've ever seen. There's also a really cool capture system where you can claim an enemy's soul to use as a second character, making the wide variety of creative foes even more appealing.\n\nMy only real knock against this game is the uneven difficulty curve... or maybe it's actually the learning curve. The first few times I played, I couldn't make it more than a few floors. Then one night I had some kind of breakthrough, and I haven't died since. One irritation is what happens when you die, because you get replaced with a weak, clunky soldier and you can't get Katrien back unless you find a special shrine that only appears once every few floors. Floors can be rated easy, medium, or hard, which has a dramatic effect on how aggressive enemies will be. However, the AI can get confused pretty easily, slipping between countering every move and standing there to get wailed on. You'll need to stick with it awhile to really get into the flow, but there's a surprising amount of secrets and special floors to discover along the way.\n\nI don't need to tell you how good this game looks, because just look at it. The art style sets the whole thing off, working perfectly with the late 19th century setting and the dreamworld motifs. There are two additional characters to unlock, additional special moves to upgrade, and a colorful cast of NPCs to learn about. Once you learn the rhythm of the game and learn where to spend your gold, you'll have plenty of fun venturing into the abyss again and again.","December 13, 2015","true","4.6"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

If I was to sum the game up I would call it "Super DarkSoulsVania 2 Turbo". It blends rpg, action platforming, and fighting game sensibilities. The fighting mechanics are deep with a lot of elements for the player to master. Abyss Odyssey is actually quite a challenging game that demands precision mastery of your attacks, as well as your platforming skills.\n\nThe game also features many unique mechanics that really helps separate this game from the heard. On death, you get a 2nd chance by having a normal, human solder to take your place. He's basically a nerfed version of other playable characters, but if you manage to reach an alter with him, you can resurrect your hero and continue your journey. If your solder dies, that's game over, the game state is reset to the beginning. You can also capture enemy souls and become them, allowing you to play as a huge number of creatures, all with their own move sets, all with their own combat style. This game is incredibly diverse. Lastly, one of the most interesting features that makes this game so unique is the ability to work with all your fellow source hunters who are playing this game to unlock new things in Abyss Odyssey. Every time some one kills the end boss while online, they contribute to the destruction of the stone mask in the game. Once the mask is destroyed, whole new elements of this game become unlocked. This is a brilliant idea that helps with replayability\n\nThrow in some local and online multiplayer, add some classic Mucha inspired art nouveau, with a pinch of punishment, and we have one of the most unique, and gorgeous action platformer that has ever graced gaming culture.\n\n9001% recommended.\n\nPros:\n- Gorgeous Mucha inspired art nouveau visual style\n- Great sound track\n- Incredibly deep mechanics\n- Diverse rogue gallery of playable creatures\n- Unique blend of rpg, action platforming, and fighting game sensibilities\n- Challenging but fair\n- Very replayable\n\nCons:\n- Large learning curb\n- Can feel sluggish at first\n- Some animation quirks\n- Could pose frustrating for some","July 19, 2014","true","39.0"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

The fighting system is just SO BAD in this game that I can't tell anyone to stay away from it enough. When playing a side-scroller fighting rogue-like RPG the player shouldn't feel like the character itself is fighting against them. I've seen and tried to replicate some of the combos i've seen on youtube and failed every time. I have also encountered my fair share of bugs where enemies will get stuck in walls (especially if you get a premature attack on them in that shadow wall that surrounds you whenever an enemy pops out) and there was even a time where a tutorial message kept me from jumping away from a swinging blade and being repeatedly knocked into a black abyss... This game looks nice and has a load of fun ideas, but the poor execution of the combat system is just too much for me to recommend this game to anyone. I'll continue to try to play it.

Unfortunately it's difficult in ways that make it seem lazy, rather than by design; its controls are not quite so tight as they need to be, and while it does have the excitement of random dungeon layouts every time, it unfortunately is so random that it's frequently unfair. It would have been far better if it took the player's level and gave it any thought, but that is beyond Abyss Odyssey. While you do retain your money and experience even after a defeat, you unfortunately don't retain any items, adding to the frustration. The promise of playing as any number of characters is also similarly not what it is presented to be; an extremely unwieldy and difficult-to-use soul capture system, through the woefully slow-filling mana, is used to temporarily command that soul. All things considered, it's not really that worth bothering with. Additionally, the character designs for female characters in the game are elegant and beautiful, but of course male characters are either placeholders or hideous. Maybe if you like teeth-grindingly annoying 'roguelikes', you'll like this. But I personally found the promise far greater than the actual game itself.

The play style reminded me of the original Ninja Gaiden, but more modern. Each level is procedurally generated, which means that every time you play the game you will have a different experience. Visually I think there are certain aspects which look nice, such as the backgrounds, but the characters don't seem to have a lot of detail and are very repetitive. There isn't a lot of variety in the way the characters look. I do like the different levels, but after a while it feels like you are playing the same ones over and over even though they look different.

It felt like a really clunky side-scrolling beat 'em up, but I persevered as I'd coaxed a friend into playing Co-Op and found something well worth your time if you give it a chance.\n\nThere are some cool features to this game, such as the fact you've technically got up to 3 lives. Whilst your main character has one life, if you die, you respawn as a variety of weaker soldiers (I believe there are 3 in total, one different soldier per main character) which you can use to reach an altar to respawn. However, you also have the ability to collect fallen enemies' souls and then by using altars, you can purchase the ability to transform into the various enemies, they have their own health bars and you can switch between the main character and the enemy at will. If there wasn't a tactical reason to use an enemy character, I'd usually use them as a buffer to keep my main character alive and developed a tiered system of use:  Enemy Character > Main Character > Soldier\n\nI had never really played a 'rogue-like' game before, so I wasn't too sure how enjoyable the random levels would be, but after quite a few deaths, you begin to realise that the randomness isn't TOO unsettling.\n\nI didn't realise this at the time, in fact, I didn't notice until the final fight with The Warlock, but this this game was created by the very same people responsible for Zeno Clash 1 & 2; two brilliant examples of First Person Beat 'Em Ups done right!\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game for around the £5 mark, I'd certainly not pay £10+ unless you are really desperate to give it a go.

The story and platforming are simplistic but effective, and the voice acting is professionally done, but the game suffers from many small annoyances that chip away from immersion, and hurt it.\n\nThe game is artistically beautiful, full of rich detail and color, and is very distinctive.  The levels are randomly generated, which is a strong point of the game, as it offers a refreshing take at a basic linear path.   The characters and creatures are unique and creative, which draws you into the environment.\n\nUnfortunately, the inventory is extremely limited, and the UI adds extra unnecessary steps making upgrading of items clunky and time consuming. The allies that help you in battle, should they kill the enemy, you will not gain any experience even if you take the enemy down from 100% hp to 5% and your ally gets final hit.\n\nMore than all of this, though, the combat is the downfall of this game; it is sluggish and clunky,\nwith slow response times from the buttons and basic combat abilities, and a delay between those abilities, taking away from the fluidity of the game.\n\nThe enemies and characters are varied in their abilities, but the hero has a limited amount of attack, limiting the variability of combat.\n\nWhile the voice acting and story progression of this game is well done, and the artwork and music are beautiful, the clunky inventory and clumsy UI combined with the sluggish combat makes for an awkward experience that I cannot recommend.\n\nFor more reviews check out the channel here http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","August 22, 2014","false","3.9"," 19 of 32 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","19","32","0","0"

Animations lock you too easily and quickly.\n\nThe game is obtuse and offers almost no guidance on its quirky mechanics.  And I suppose I could handle death penalty if it wasn't so random and out of your control -- sometimes you just get mobbed by 3 fluid, well-aiming enemies who simultaneously kill you very quickly while you struggle with just aiming the right direction.  I don't want to grind for gold to replace expensive weapons so I can continue when that happens.\n\nThere are a lot of other minor complaints, like the common problem that it is VERY evident that the game was quickly ported over to PC from consoles with as little change as possible in UI and control scheme.  Hint: ESC should not take you to main game menu from anywhere in the game; it should function as a "back" button when you are in in-game menus.  Do NOT require the player to press the B key to exit a menu on a PC game; we hate stuff like this.  It's more irritating over time than it would first appear.  In the world of PC ergonomics, it's like putting the doorbell button to your house on the mailbox 30 feet away from the door.\n\nAgain, like others, I was attracted by the art and music and visually fluid animations, but had enough of the unresponsive controls; and terrible, poorly-ported UI; and the death penalty + death by UI + need for grinding to get equipment again.\n\nNote on hours played: I played a few hours on my son's account, so you can consider me as having about 4 hours in.  If there is indeed a gem buried under the punitive barriers to entry, I couldn't bring myself to play further to see it.  If I hear that these issues have been addressed later, I would be happy to try again and revise my review.","September 5, 2015","false","1.6"," 31 of 55 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","31","55","0","0"

When I move my character, I don't feel like I have full control or at the very least can expect where my actions will take me.\n\nThe UI is a bit of a buzz-kill. It's lacking the necessary information to help me understand what I'm doing. I ended up getting the "special cancel" ability (whatever that is) by mistake as I was interested in what it did. Nope. Turns out I wasted a skill point on it and still didn't figure out what it, or the other special abilities I received, actually did.\n\nUltimately what got me to stop playing was when I died as Katreina and revived as a soldier, I was stuck in a pit. The controls for each character differ and the jumping for the solider is much shorter. Because of this, I couldn't jump up over a ledge (which did not at all seem intentional).\n\nSorry, but I can't recommend a game that just doesn't feel complete. :-(","January 27","false","1.8"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","10","15","2","1"

I saw this game  that sounded liked Smash bros. mixed with castvania. Which is actually a perfect way to describe this game's controls.\n\nPoint 1 combat - The combat is slightly clunky by design. It hards to turn around because you suffer from a massive amounts of ending lag. This means if you are overwelmed getting quickly comboed  by enemies can happen.\n- You can cancel all your actions into dogdes or specials you must ,however have a charge in your cancel meter(which recharges over time). This makes you have to strategize on being more offencive or defencive\n- You can also block in this game but so can enemies. Both can be simply grabbed out of block.\nPoint 2 Platfroming- The jumping in this game feels the same as Smash brother if you hit back and jump at the same time you jump back facing in the same direction as when your feet were still planted. This allows for retreating attacks in fights but can make the platforming feel a bit comberson at times. Wall jumping is also by my experiance useless. You gain so little height it is better just to try to just make the jump with your mid-air jup alone. The wall slide is also delayed so wall jumps are even more delayed and useless. You can however use dodges in the air to get extra distance which is nice.\n\nBe prepared to get used to the controls, and have fun.","April 12","true","13.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hotax/recommended/255070/","hotax","WTF 3 finals 1 day PogChamp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hotax/","732 products in account","Product received for free\n\nAbyss Odyssey is one of the best indie games I have played this year.\n\nThis game is a rogue-like 2d brawler with combat similar to the Smash Bros games set in an alternate universe 1890s Chile in which the dreams of a warlock have started physically manifest in the real world and threaten everyone's wellbeing. The story is actually very interesting. However most of it is told through notes you randomly find during gameplay and a few cut scenes. Animations and combat look and feel great. Also the visuals are some of the best I've seen from a 2d platformer. They aren't on Trine or Ori levels of greatness, but they are pretty damn good. There are 3 main playable characters each with a unique weapon and moveset complex enough that this game's combat system could have easily been made for a competitive fighting game. Not only that, you are also able to captures the souls of every enemy you defeat as long as your character's level is high enough. Then you can use those enemies, all of which also have their own unique and fun movesets.\n\nFor a rogue-like game, this game is actually very lenient. When you die you get the chance to continue as a soldier, which while obviously being weaker than your main character, is sufficient enough a lot of the time to last until you get to a respawn point for your character. If your soldier dies then it's truly gameover and you must restart from the beginning. When you die your character keeps all of his or her levels and gold though. As a casual player of rogue-likes I actually enjoyed this aspect because it means that every run, no matter how bad, lead to some progress. However after a while when your character gets to the higher levels and becomes somewhat rich, the game becomes a bit too easy in my opinion. Every single playthrough has a randomized map with different paths all eventually leading to the Warlock, aka the final boss. The Warlock is one of the most interesting boss designs I have seen in any video game. The idea is that as more people across the whole world beat the Warlock, all players will be contributing to the game's future content. Basically, whenever the Warlock is killed "x" number of times worldwide, the Warlock will gain a new ability for every player to experience. This is interesting because it means that people who play this game later actually get the "fuller" experience. That being said this game isn't that popular anymore so I doubt the Warlock will be changing anytime soon.\n\nEnemy AI is generally quite good. I do suspect that the AI is cheating a bit in that it probably reads some of the player's inputs directly. However, I am fine with that because the AI doesn't actually feel unfair most of the time, rather it just gives a good challenge.\n\nThe game also supports local co-op and online/local pvp multiplayer (which is sadly dead)\n\nSo at this point you are probably wondering. If I am giving this game so much praise (which is does indeed deserve imo), who does this game currently have a ~50% mixed steam review rating? I can pinpoint one glaring flaw with the game which didn't really bother me all too much, but will definitely bother some. Simply when you are in the middle of a combo, you cannot break out of the animation until it is done or you get hit. This makes it somewhat frustrating when you are flailing away at the wrong side, open for the enemy to attack for several seconds. This will be a deal breaker for some. For me it was not.\n\nAlso other people seem to be complaining about the controls in general. Yes they don't feel extremely crisp like a triple a brawler. But on a 360 pad they felt fine for me after a little getting used to.\n\nReplayability for this game is definitely high because it's a rogue-like. However, I think due to the nature of how the player will eventually snowball because of the permanent leveling system, this game has less replayability than most rogue-likes simply because eventually it will get too easy. There is a hard mode called nightmare mode tho.","May 30","true","6.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

There is also a problem when it comes to using a special move to go up higher than your jump I set the jump specials to UP and special, which will automaticly cause me to fall through the platforms aswell.\n\nItem labels:\nThere is a lack of infortmation in game.\n\nThe game is very basic and simple, so it is not a big fault point. That is unless you are like me, and love to have clear information on gear that your character equips. The problem is, main items have its damage values, and the magic effect / level. extra gear such as belts and rings may raise the magic effects stats by percentages, but I am not givin the base information on the main item to know excatly if what I have is doing anything significant.\n\nContent / length:\nThe game feels short, and the main core of the game does not have alot of substance to it.\n\nLeveling only gives you the ability to add three stats to your special ablities, damage, damage reduction, add mana,\na maximum of 3 times to each skill. The characters stats increase automaticly and are hidden.\n\nThere are only a few special core events e.g.: buy hidden random stat till death, get a free item to be attacked later, certain walls only break to certain weapons.\n\nI beat the game in about 4 hours, and again in about 45 min to an hour and half. (I have yet to play nightmare or experiance everything)\n\nReplayablity feels limited, I expect people will get about 4 hours out of this game before moving on.\n\nI did fight a random boss after the last time I beat the game, and started another playthrough. I got my ♥♥♥ handed to me, but I have yet to see if it will happen again. I hate the feeling of missed oppertunity that may never return.(I returned, beat the game and the special boss a couple of more times, all playthroughs felt the same).\n\nI have mixed feelings on the AI because it does feel like they use input cheats, but at the same time I am not a programer, but I still think that is a neccessary thing for a fast pace fighting game. My feelings are the A.I feels balanced and not overly cheap.\n\nPros:\n\nSimple combat with a basic set of moves that are easy to preform. game feels easy and natural to play.\n\nGraphics look awesome I give it a 10 for these reasons: Easy on the eyes, interesting to look at, little details, I can tell what and where things are, platforms and walkways are clear, hidden walls are not overly hidden.\n\nIn game story is simple. I  skipped the starting cutscene, but still got what i think is all the story. The story is non intrusive to the gameplay.\nEach character is diffrent, e.g.: stats, speed, move set, specials, feel.\n\nNothing feels tacked on.\n\nFor a rougelite (intent to die alot, random level / item generation). I never felt the game was overly hard or impossible. Even the end boss fight felt “fair” in terms of fighting games.\n\nUnlockable content for free as people play. I would rather have it as I beat the game and not others.\n\nMy thoughts and description:\n\nThis game is a side scrolling beatum up/random generated scenarios rpg. It was alot of fun and some what challanging without being overly frustrating. There was some controls to get use to, but it didn't take long to get use to; with the exception of the cons i put above. This is a game that I recommend because there is no other game similar to it that I would recommend over it. A nich game for sure.","November 24, 2014","true","12.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

This game has a lot going for it.  The graphics have a very particular style to them and the environments are truly phenomenal.  The music is also well matched to each particular environment to really make you feel as if you were in that area.  The entire game has a very dark and eerie feel, while still portraying enough action and even slight adventure to keep the player really involved.  In short, I really like this game.\n\nI love the uniqueness of the enemies throughout the game, and the ability to capture their souls and become them is just icing on the cake because it gives real variety to a game that establishes only three main characters.  This offers an enormous amount of replayability.  I was already enjoying the game as the main character, but right when I felt like she was becoming stale, I managed to capture the soul of a burning mummy, which is freaking awesome.  At any point now, I can become that mummy whenever I want to with no penalty until he dies and his abilities are vastly different from the main character's skillset.\n\nI do have to admit a certain affinity for the ghost monk.  I mean, come on.  It's a flippin ghost monk with a two-handed longsword.  Why would this not be the character you would want to play as?  The items come in massive variety as well.  Everything from swords and halberds with different elemental attacks, down to bracelets and necklaces that offer very helpful resistances or boosts.  All too often though, I seem to come across many more weapons that just happen to be for a character I'm not playing as.  If you can never equip these weapons in the current run you're in, and the game randomly generates a new dungeon run every time, why even have weapons that aren't for you appear?  They serve no purpose, rather than to taunt you with the hope of a gleaming new item, only to find out you can't use it.  Ever.  You can't even pick them up to sell them to a merchant.\n\nI'm also not too fond of the fact that you can't keep your items from playthrough to playthrough.  The only thing that remains yours throughout is gold.  Unless there is some banking system that I'm not aware of (and please let me know if there is)  Moving on from that though.  The character skillsets are nice and varied to offer up plenty of exciting playtime without getting boring and the skillpoints that can be used to level up different skills in different ways are nice too.  However, I do wish there was even more variety with that system.\n\nAnd then we come to the enemies in the game.  The baddies.  And some of them, randomly, can become very, very difficult.  It's interesting that in my short time that I've played this game, I've ran into the same enemies time and time again to find that at some times, the enemies will just stand there, while other times, will be relentless in their assaults, sometimes not ever offering up opportunities for counterattacks.  And this seems to happen regardless of what difficulty the current area is at.  This can get frustrating at times, considering how slow the controls can feel at points throughout the game.  After a while though, you do get used to the controls, because at first, they are not fun to deal with.  And I think that is a side-effect of other games that have similar fighting styles such as Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. series where the controls are nearly flawless in every aspect.  The controls in Abyss Odyssey aren't that bad, Super Smash controls are just that good.  And we've been spoiled.\n\nOverall, I do really like this game and I know in the coming months I will pour countless hours into this game (because I LOVE randomly generated content like this game has to offer).  It has it's faults, but I highly recommend it.","October 30, 2014","true","14.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/255070/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","Summary:\nA game that may not have the longevity to warrant comparisons to Rogue Legacy, but definitely has a unique battle system that relies more of slow but pointed movement. The combat system at its core felt like a good changeup for the genre as it reminded me of having influences from fencing, and it's complemented by a beautiful art style and a great soundtrack. The game does have content problems, as it's corridors and enemies do start to grow stale over time, especially in the layout department. However, combat surprisingly never felt TOO repetitive for me due to its mechanics, and I disagree with a lot of users saying that the controls are bad for the game: they perfectly fit in for what the combat was trying to do. In the end, the mixed rating on Steam really surprised me about Abyss Odyssey: I felt the game did give a great experience that stood out from others in the genre, and is definitely worth a look for fans looking for a slower, but more detailed combat experience in the end.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://youtu.be/XQMovTDE3PQ\n\nLists:\n+:\nCombat feels pointed and well refined with all the different characters and monsters that you can play as, and yet it working well for all of them. If you're looking for Smash/Rogue Legacy, it's not that, but something a bit different, where it punishes you for big mistakes.\nPrecision is rewarded well and I really enjoy that. You really do feel like you master combat in the game once you get a hang of it.\nSome claim the controls are bad for the game, and I have to say: nonsense. It works well for the kind of game that it was going for, that it complements the game in the right ways.\nLike the basic storyline they go for here, despite it not being that big in the overall picture. Enough intrigue to make you want to know more.\nInteresting mechanic in the soldier picking up where the hero leaves off, being a bit underpowered but having to fight his way to resurrect the hero. Liked it.\nCharacters feel unique despite seeing some of them before in other games of their series. Always loved these character designs, even the human ones.\nWonderful aesthetic with a great soundtrack makes a game that hits well with it's overall art style and unique 2D/3D models.\n-:\nOver time, the lack of variety in the environments will make the game feels repetitive.\nCould have used a lot more “random” events to spice things up over time.\nLeveling feels unbalanced in the long run, as having higher levels seems to make the game significantly easier, or at least it feels like it. Wasn't having problems at all around level 50.\nThere's some weird glitches that happen, and a reasonable slowdown at times when defeating enemies. It's not the most optimized of games, that's for sure.\nSome double jumps can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ with the secondary characters in particular. Too little leeway at times can lead to a lot of frustration.","November 2, 2015","true","9.8"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","9","14","2","1"

But it's not very good. The controls aren't great and it's the kind of game where you have a lot of trouble just trying to attack in the right direction. And there are a lot of invulnerability frames for enemies that don't make any sense. And there is very little hint as to when an enemy is taking an action. And a lot of enemies are based around a mechanic that makes some amount of damage unavoidable (which is a huge issue in a roguelike).\n\nAlso, the multiplayer is *completely* unplayable for the person who joins. There is just too much lag, even with <100 ping. It looks OK, but enemies hit you before they even begin an animation and it makes blocking utterly useless. And you teleport around a lot as the physics think you meant to dash / jump when you didn't, because you are in a slightly different position on the server. And even if you had a connection good enough to have little issues with lag, there aren't any servers. If you want to play this with a friend (like I did), it's a gamble of whether or not this will even work for you.\n\nAlmost a good game. Try Rogue Legacy, it's 1000x better than this one.

It's quite hard at first, and some things are frustrating but overall it's very fun. It's like a psuedo-rogue.  The idea is that you keep replaying, but all the levels are randomly generated, so it doesn't get boring. Each time you go through you unlock something new, be it charaters, areas, or whatever. Money in this game goes quick and seems hard to ever have enough of. If you keep dying, don't worry. You keep all experience despite losing items. Personally I think the item loss after a death is one of the most frustrating parts, but the items really dont do that much for you in the end. Your level is far more important to your damage and life bar. It seems that once I gain a sufficient level I'll no longer be dying all the time. Levels 15-20 seem like they're the sweet spot for making it through the game for the first time. Keep trying and you'll make it.

The combat system leaves a bit to be desired... you can have enemies on either side of you and if you want to switch direction to fight the other enemy you have to stop fighting and turn around which does not happen instantly. For me this is annoying because it removed the feel of fluidity from the fight. Played it with a friend which was fun   for sure... but we both noticed a huge lack of opportunities to regain any health after combat from slain enemies or smashing containers. Also we did not like how you have to PAY for your checkpoints with coins, and not just a few coins either. I've never in my life seen a game that required payment for a much needed checkpoint. Another big annoyance was loosing all your weapons and powerups that you payed a bunch of coins for when you die. After a couple instances of that we just stopped buying anything except for health vials.\n\nAll b-itching aside this game is very interesting and colorful. The music is very groovy. And there really is a lot of potential here. But that combat system (in my opinion) could use some tweaking. If nothing else being able to change directions while fighting would be a serious improvement.\n\nKeep up the good work.

From my extensive knowledge of smash brothers, even the best of people can get easily cheesed/comboed/killed when outnumbered with decent skill/AI; get ready to die when you're unlucky. This game requires  some skill level, and understanding of the combat system; tactiful mind knowing when to retreat, spacing, and etc. The speed of this game is not very fast paced compared to many other more recent fighting games so some might say it is slow/clunky so it takes a few tries to get use to (there is a training room). My friend is pretty bad at platformer games, so it was funny watching him die from failed jump attempts multiple times. I'm a terrible person.\n\nYou can play as 3 main characters, but you are able to capture/buy "souls" to transform into monsters and play as them until you want to switch or it gets killed (which then you return to your character as they were before you transformed). Using monster transformations makes getting through the game easier. Some monsters suck while others have really cheesy skill sets and/or incredible mobility (centaurs can jump very high and far). You can purchase/find items, but they are temporary (you lose them on death) so the only thing you really keep is money. The game also updates based on how many times the final boss was defeated (total of leadboard scores).\n\nCo-op mode is fun, but with friendly fire on (default setting) in this type of game I can see why only 2 players are supported. You would spend more time getting beat up by your teammates than the monster. Luckily, there is an option to turn off friendly fire with minor limitations (leaderboard related). Monsters can't hit each other unless charmed so I think it isn't fair getting mobbed esp in co-op (increased number of monsters boss/miniboss)if they all ignore your friend and decide to ♥♥♥♥ you instead. HINT: if you solo play in online settings make sure FRIENDLY FIRE IS ON so you can kill monsters you've charmed instead of waiting for it to wear off.\n\nBTW PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT CONTROLS BEING INCOMPATIBLE. People give diffrent suggestions, but I personally use Joy-to-Key program.

At first I wasn't too happy with it, because the game literally tells you nothing going in. However, after about a half hour or so it started to click - it's a a roguelike platformer with a combat focus, basically.\n\nI was expecting the combat to be similar to something like Marvel vs Capcom based on videos, but in reality it's much closer to Smash Bros, with normal and special attacks based on directional commands. Once you get the hang of it, taking down a bunch of dudes feels pretty satisfying. I strongly recommend getting the special cancel upgrades when you can, because it gives you a lot more freedom to play how you want.\n\nI also love the art and sound design - If you've played ACE Team's other games like Zeno Clash you know they have a tendency to get weird, but the atmosphere in AO skews much more towards "pleasantly trippy" than "uncomfortably disturbing" like parts of ZC did.\n\nOne complaint I have is that for a roguelike, the main difficulty isn't too hard - I beat the final boss on my second try, though it's worth mentioning the difficulty scales as you level up. Also, the devs just added a "Nightmare Mode," and it they're already tweaking game balance via patches. It sounds like ACE Team has every intention of continuing to update for months to come, so I'm definitely curious to see how the game changes in the future.

While starting out the controls felt clunky and heavy-ish, after some time in combat I understood that the way fighting was designed its just something you have to get used to. It does become more tactical, but in a sort of rock paper scissors advanced kind of way. Move in, are they blocking? I should throw or move away or throw a fireball to goad them into a dodge to catch them at the end of their animation. Which became more enjoyable as I continued playing the game.\n\nI didn't really play the other characters, however I was more concentrated on beating the game. If you're looking for a game to enjoy a playthrough and have a good experience based on that single playthrough, I don't recommend this game. However if you're looking for a game where you jump in, fight enemies for a while and enjoy a randomized dungeon experience through a bunch of playthroughs. I would recommend this game.\n\nI beat the game in two sittings and enjoyed the experience but its not a game that really sticks with me and makes me want to talk about it with everyone. If  someone was like "Hey I saw you play Abyss Odyssey on Steam, how is it?" I'd just be like "Its aight." and that's all. But it does feel like a good game for when I come home and just want to beat up some stuff with some strategy and don't want to put too much effort into.\n\nTo sound like an old fogey gamer (which I might very well be at this point) the gameplay is reminiscent of games from the SNES era where you just played it and got used to the controls, clunky controls weren't something to be like "Screw this game." as long as the clunkiness worked with the gameplay. Then it was just getting used to how to play the game and finding the experience you were meant to enjoy because you had 5 more days with the rental and you beat all your other games already, also you just moved to the area and realized it was a neighborhood of grandparents mainly so you had no other kids to play with.","February 25","true","5.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

You do the basic things one would expect from those latter 3 genres -- fighting heaps of disposable bad guys, hopping around on moving floors, and crawling through variable dungeons that change with each iteration. But it's the fighting game mechanics that will carry you. Your use of animation cancels, unforgiving parries, launches, juggles, and general purpose combo mastery will carry you.\n\nThe better you are at these fighting game mechanics, the faster you'll progress. A solid player can beat the boss within a few hours. There's a lot more to accomplish including fleshing out all the heroes, capturing all the enemies in the cool extra-life soul-stealing system, and multiplayer and nightmare difficulty.\n\nSo take this recommendation with a caveat. The price you get Abyss Odyssey at should reflect the extent to which you can explore the game's mechanical depth and it should reflect your willingness to play to completion. If Abyss Odyssey is a one-and-done game to you, wait for a sale that justifies 3 hours of play. If your fighter mechanics are solid and you tend to be a completionist, feel free to pick it up for retail price.","November 9, 2015","true","6.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

This aspects shine as the principal one.\n\nSince it's relies so much on frenetic, quick and precise controls, like old days games, you need to be prepared to learn well how to use all the functions.\nAnyway it's simple to get used to the controls functions, but...\nIt seems that some people had input delays on controls.\nI had the same issue and was really about to upset me.\nAnyway I understood that the reason for that delay was for my pc specs, so, lowering the resolution and removing effects with a bit of patience, trying, until the right one configuration was found.\n\nKeep in mind that this game works perfectly with a gamepad ( I use xinput compatible 360 pad), and is definitely high recommended.\nI have really enjoyed how works using the right analog stick for normal attacks, this function gives a sense of "fencing" to all the fights.\n\nAbout gameplay and replayability.\nSince it has roguelike elements it's intended to be played a LOT of times and it's quite enjoyable doing so, especially if you'll like the story since using one character will unlock new dialogs lines with the final boss.\nOne appoint could be done for the lenght of each stage-level for being too short: once the player get accustomed to various   game elements one run could be done pretty fast, around 45 min.\n\n-It reminds me old school games I used to play that I could replay day after day beating each time the game.\nUsing the main character made me recall the first Prince of Persia, maybe for the platform action and each fight was an actual duel-\n\nAnyway seems that more additional content will be done as well some adjustments for the options and configuration.\n\nGraphic and sound\nFluid animations, great pc/npc/creatures models, a lot of stunning background visible in distance (another unique aspect with some nice light effects) and a wonderful artwork set.\nMusic themes change on levels, nice, but not its strenghtpoint, proper voiceacting.\n\nRecommended to those in search for an original story and atmosphere, visually appealing artworks, and a bite of old school gaming.\n","July 16, 2014","true","64.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zaelle/recommended/255070/","zaelle","Zaelle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zaelle/","105 products in account","TL;DR: Having played a few hours so far I can attest this game is fun if you like side scrolling beat 'em ups with rogue-like elements and is worth the price ($10 that I paid, but I would pay $15). You can progress in the normal game by using basic techniques and skills or you can excel and go for the harder stuff by really practicing advanced techniques.\n\nNon-TL;DR:\n\n\nSome cons:\n\n\nThere really isn't a lot of balance when it comes to the enemy souls. Some dominate, others die way too easily. To be fair, though, some of this is based simply on how well you understand their playstyle. Some of them benefit from a semblance of button mashing, and others you will get horribly punished for trying that and require some finesse. Then there are those few that are just bad and need some work.\n\nThe controls have some small issues, but overall I have experienced much worse. For one, the climb up ledges mechanic has really plagued me. I'm not sure if it's just me or if it others have the issue, but I find myself falling a lot more than I believe I should when I feel I was correct in my controls. That said, very few times (I'm looking at you fiery shadow pits) has it caused me any big issues. Most of the time it just impedes my speed in progress. Actual combat feels well except for some rare instances of your character not wanting to turn around as snappy as you might be used to in most games of this type. However, personally, I feel as though this was intended to keep people from being button mashy and spammy.\n\nAs is, I think the item depth is a bit lacking. I am going to assume that the future will hold some updates that expand the library of items as well as souls so I am not too concerned with it right now.\n\nThe environments, while pretty, sometimes feel a bit samey (and this is after only four hours of gameplay). I know this is a curse of rogue-like/procedurally generated games, but it should be mentioned all the same. A little more detailed variety could really spice things up.\n\n\nSome pros:\n\n\nThe basic mode difficulty as it is now, is fair. I have gotten massacred quite a few times but also excelled quite a few times based almost completely on my performance with a bit of random thrown in for flavor. I have not tried Nightmare mode yet.\n\nThe art style is beautiful.\n\nThe music is great. I found myself grooving quite a few times while trouncing foes.\n\nI like having various souls and items show up randomly. It's fun having things not be the same all the time.\n\nThe characters are all well designed, as well as the enemies. I have not found one yet that I disliked.\n\nBeing able to respec your skills is a lot of fun and encourages experimentation and building for specific floors if you feel the need. (Small con: You can't respec your skill cancel orbs.)\n\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\n\nWell worth the price I paid and with all the feedback from the community pouring in I expect it to get even better.","July 20, 2014","true","28.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You're going to need to give the enemies more attention than you're used to, and the controls will not be like those of a platformer.\n\nBut if you're willing to put some effort into learning the controls, it can be a very challenging and fun title.\n\nThe art style and  atmosphere created make this one of my favorite games.  The enemies are interesting and well scripted, so that you'll need to learn their individual strategies and weaknesses in order to deal with them.  The three main playable characters have very different fighting styles and allow for customization of weapons, accessories and special moves.  These can synergize to give the player much more power when the right combinations are found.\n\nThe levels are procedurally generated, so each playthrough you'll want to pay attention to the map layout to find the most desirable route.  The different difficulties make quite a bit of difference in AI ability, and you'll want to stick to the easy levels until you get the hang of it.\n","October 27, 2015","true","64.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

However what this game lacks in smooth gameplay, it tries it's hardest to make up for in looks and variety. The game looks absolutely stunning, and the designs of the characters are varied and interesting. The different areas are all great, but I wish there was a little more variety in them. Once you've seen one particular "tileset" you've seen all the permutations of it.\n\nThe combat, which should be the core of the game feels a little bit "floaty". This doesn't feel great for what is essentially a fighting game. Sometimes moves that look like they should be hitting just go through enemies completely, and this just makes the combat feel not that great at times. It's still serviceable and has a ton of depth since you can capture enemy souls and play as them, which is the main draw of the game. Each enemy has a pretty distinct moveset and while some are clearly better than others each enemy has their own style and this gives a ton of replay value for the game.\n\nThis replayability is much needed, since the game is actually kind of easy. I played this both co-op and solo, and the solo experience actually felt a lot easier. Enemies are more passive when you are alone and usually come at you one at a time. While in co-op play you usually tend to get ganged up on and comboed by multiple enemies at a time which makes the experience frustrating at times.\n\nAll in all amazing art and music, decent combat, fun exploration and good replayability make this an overall great experience.","October 30, 2014","true","7.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The multiplayer segment is probably the biggest selling point for a metroidvania trying to differntiate itself from the rest\n\nAfter you get the hang of the game, progressing to the bottom of the dungeon is not particularly difficult, and can be accomplished relatively quickly. at that point of the game, emphasis changes from merely progressing through the dungeon to smaller objectives: collecting all note book peices (items that convey the game's lore) leveling and improving your character's equipment, and collecting all playable enemies.

Many have complaints about this mechanic in the forum, but I think it works just fine. Also, the game is designed for multiple play-through, so don't expect it to be long to reach the final boss (took me about an hour on the first try).

It's hardcore during the gameplay and it doesn't leave you with too many choices. for example, you can only carry and equip 2 weapons at a time so as you move on, you should only carry what you wish to equip for your ring slot and same for anything else. This also mean that you have to take your time to think what you will chose to take out for the right situation and what you will leave behind for good.\nNot only that, everything is expensive so the economy is perfect. It's hard enough to get your health and mana back which is cool. The death penalties will leave on on the edge of your seat the whole time, especially if you play on hard.\n\nNow, again, good intention, very bad delivery.\n\nThe gameplay is trying to Emulate Super Smash bros's combat style. I'm a big fan of this game, but in what AO fails is at the responsiveness of the game. The game itself is clunky as hell by nature; the game is unpolished. I feel like they rushed for the release button instead of making sure that everything was right before launching the game.\nThere's combos, but they're not good looking at all. The abilities are boring, nothing special to see here.\n\nNow, the worst part of the game is when you die.\nSo you start a new game or you come-back home from work just to play Abyss(A(0) waste of time btw). From the 3 heroes aivalable, you pick your favorite one or you resume your game with one of them.\nAs you go on and as you try your best to love the game that you just spent 14$ on, you suddenly die.\nYou think dying is what bothers me? Not at all. Becoming a regular soldier is what bothers me.\n(Wait), i usually play Mount & Blade Napoleonic war so playing as a French solder during the 18 century is really not what bothers me at all.\nIt's the fact that these soldiers they got a boring attack pattern, a boring gun, a boring whirlwind attack and a boring everything else.\nI have to put up with this soldier until i die. Having some random soldiers that can help you is cool, but that's about it.\nThe whole time that i'm playing as a soldier, it just feels like the death-blow aspect of the game for me. I just want to click on the Exit button when i become one.\n\nConclusion: It's not only worth a buy because it's too expensive for how poor the game feels like, i don't think this game can appeal to anyone as-well; not the hardcore gamers, not the casual gamers,\nnot even for players with an open mind(and i'm one of them).","May 15, 2015","false","2.4"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","0"

Beautiful created world, I love it. Very bizzare and weird. Characters are unique.\nThe story is interesting.\nMusic is good, sounds are good.\n\nBut, Oh, My.... the combat system is horrible. The worst combat system I've seen for very long time. Sometimes the enemeies are super easy, other times they won't give you a chance to stand up and mostly the combats are 1 versus dozens and the whole screen swarms with enemes. The A.I. is horrible and sometimes it kills itself. So the gameplay kills everything with this game. Terrible, shocking how bad it could be.\n\nNot  to mention that when you "die", you WILL lose all you equipement and will start all over again, unless you put special totem to a checkpoint but believe me, this totem costs a lot and you will find yourself grinding the sparce gold to get those, rather get new equipement, which is extremely hard.\n\nBossess are pain in the ♥♥♥ and you do little damage with the nomal weapons.\nYou level but there is almost no use of this leveling up.\n\nThere are some annoying bugs like- the game won't let you close the pop-up screen (a hint from the game) so you need to quit the level and start all over again. Other bug like from the beginning of the tutorial, the game bugged and you could not progress.\n\nThis game is made for console peasants and it is not for PC MASTER race. I wonder how Gaben let this game be on steam.\n\nI got the game on humble bundle sale, two copies and at least I got the cards.\n\nProbably if you play this game in co-op, it would be much better, that someone can help you out, but I do not have a co-op partner for this game, so it sucks to be solo.\n\nTo the devs, do not make this kind of games anymore. You suck at them. Go make Zeno Clash 3 or something like that.","December 22, 2015","false","3.8"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","16","30","0","0"

That's not really accurate at all. The game was clearly designed to evoke that exact comparison, though - a lot of mechanics, the art style, and even the controls are largely cribbed from the above influences.\n\nAbyss Odyssey has controls of Super Smash Brothers, but does not play at all like Super Smash Brothers. It plays like a traditional fighter: slower, methodical, combo-based.\n\nAbyss Odyssey has the look of Castlevania, but does not play at all like Castlevania. You do not explore, and the dungeon isn't really that interesting or well-designed (indeed, it's not designed at all, because it's randomly generated).\n\nI still like this game for what it is, but I do feel that the hype is misleading.

Three characters, many more monsters (which you can possess), and a huge, procedurally-generated dungeon. There's a lot to love here. The visuals are gorgeous, as well. It plays more like a fighting game than a beat-em-up (it even has a cancelling system!) but most of the moves have a lot of ending lag so the controls can seem a bit sluggish. I tend do only do aerial attacks because the ending lag is cancelled when you land (pro tip!). The game can get a bit repetative and easy after sinking several hours into it. I guarantee you won't get far at level 1, but by level 50 you won't even need to put much planning into your route or items. There is also a "nightmare" difficulty, but I haven't tried that out yet. I would have appreciated more character variety and faster-paced fighting, but I like what they gave me anyway.

This game has some excellent qualities, and holds on to you for a bit.  One of the greatest side-scrolling hack and slash games' I've found for those thirsty for some hack and slash, without the over-the-top gore and special effects, not to say it doesnt have it's own special effects.  Probably one of the most beautiful side scrollers I've played in a loooong time, the environments are either lush, or barren, dependening how deep into the abyss you get?  There is a Beautiful Soundtrack that enhances the mood tenfold, alot of thought was put into it, with beautifully instense piano clips, and music fitting the mood, perfect for the environments you find yourself in.  The Environments follow the old platforming standart of Earth,Wind,Water, and Fire, which are gorgeously Illustrated, with deep levels of parrallax scrolling.  You can sit and pick out details in the background that look like you could just reach out and grab them, not quite on the level of Trine or Trine 2, but beautiful, and effective nonetheless.\n\nNow here is the news on combat, you can either play this game just mashing the buttons and not get as far, but more than likely, you are going to have to develop some sort of strategy, at some point,  The game basically ramps up the difficulty to make it more of a challenge when you rank up, and it does subtle changes to the AI when the game realises you are dying waay too much.  The combat system is pretty nice it uses the Xbox 360 controller very well, all of the buttons are taken into account from the beginning.  I'll let you discover the combos on your own, it'd be a spoiler to take away the fun of discovering how deep the control scheme actually is.  I actually found it good enough to go into the "Practice" gamemode, This game wants you to beat it, but not too quickly.  Therein lies the good and the bad, the story is paper thin, which allows you to basically hack and slash your way through it without thinking too deeply, and adds a little emptiness and sorrow to the game, without detracting from it's character.   It sometimes gets real hard to navigate through the abyss you hit a "hard" room and it can be all over in one encounter (I.E. the Life that you enter the Abyss with Is all you get), which isn't bad, but you don't want to give up even if you only have 400+ health out of 2200, and you can still pick up characters that you defeat. and add them to your inventory to use in a pinch.  It's all really fun, and frustrating, which I believe it strikes a perfect balance.\n\nIn Closing, i highly recommend this game to any hack and slash platform lovers, it will not dissappoint.","November 14, 2015","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It's a rogue lite action game that sort of resembles Super Smash Brosh in its control scheme. Simple but elegant. The game has some bugs though, the end boss is rather lame and the controls aren't sublime either, but despite this it's one of the best games I've played in a while. The reason is Abyss Odyssey is one of those games that prove that games can be art too, and that art doesn't have to be all that pretentious and self-important. Abyss Odyssey is a piece of art that's fun.\n\nThe game has plenty of weird and interesting characters, like the duck man, the bull that shoots laser and samba Zorro. On top of that you can use all of them yourself. So although there are only three main characters, there's plenty of others you can use. The atmosphere is odd and mysterious. Its set in the Chilean civil war, there's the devil playing the fiddle, you can steal the shopkeeper's soul. You never know what you're gonna see next. The voice acting isn't that great though, but there's not much of it anyways.\n\nThe extra life system is quite ingenious as well. When your main character dies, a Chilean soldier appears, and you can control him. If you find a shrine, you can revive the character. It feels weird at first, but it's more interesting than the traditional "lose one life"-thing. There's also two player co-op that's fun and chaotic.\n\nLike I said earlier, Abyss Odyssey has some bugs, so it's not perfect, but despite playing it just left me happy, because I felt like I experienced something new and exciting. I've played hundreds of different games in my life, and games nowadays rarely make me feel like I did when I was 10; this one managed it. Abyss Odyssey is some group's incomprehensible Dantean vision which I was happy to share.","November 16, 2015","true","17.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game also has a unique option of giving you a "second chance" where a soldier steps in to take over the fight once you are down (at least for me).

Lets just say that I was not disappointed at all.\n\nI assume the description of the game above would suffice so I won't touch much on describing the setting or the events.\n\nI would like to start with the music, a core for such fantasy games if I do say so myself. This game has a rather memorable sound track that more then fits the setting and resounds with you as the adventurer traveling deep within the abyss. whether you are traveling through cold crystalized caverns or through the hot and humid depths covered with foliage and jungle vines the music seems to pop out and speak well with the player.\nI rather like orchestra based music so a 9/10 will be my rating\n\nThe graphics and art style are a good choice for such a game. The enviroment seems to pop and speak out very nicely.\nNot much else to say about the graphics so we will leave it with an 8/10\n\nNow the gameplay is what I liked the most. It reminded me of games like retro castlevenia with the side scrolling adventuring elements along with the diverse baddies and ability system. Its got a wonderful feel that I feel would have great replay value and while I keep dying and respawning just to die again I still have not felt that replay value lower for me. The AI is fun and advanced from the easy all the way to the hard floors and I have found no true patterns to their movement and attacks. oh.. I forgot to mention that you also have the ability to play as the enemies but that is only possible if you have obtained their soul through purchase of a merchant in the abyss or through a lucky drop. I would also like to say that you have no ability to collect equipment and that if you die you start back at ground zero, your levels and abilities stay at their respective level and status along with your gold value but your items themselves are lost to the abyss until you buy them or find them again.\n9/10 since it offers great gameplay and at a high replay value\n\nMultiplayer seems to be finicky for me. If I invite my own friend or brother it will work fine but if I join another person or they join me it has a lagfest now and then. I do love the support of several players on the same PC and since I just so happen to have several controllers laying around I gotta say, this is a very useful feature. It just so happens that you can also attack your allies so in a fight sometimes it is best to isolate yourself away from your ally unless you can find a safe approach.\n5/10 but when it is working 10/10\n\n\nMusic - 9/10\nGraphics - 8/10\ngameplay - 9/10\nMultiplayer - 5/10 but if working 10/10\nOverall this game is amazing for its price and I would recommend it to anybody who is looking into buying it.\nYou can add me to play with me if you want ;D\n","July 16, 2014","true","17.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have seen people say the controls are clunky, they are queued it's a game mechanic often used in platformers.

So I rejoiced when Abyss Odyssey actually let me set my own controls. INSIDE the game client! That always seems to be the first thing that lower budget titles and console ports leave out these days, as even the occasional AAA game forces you to muck about manually altering config files in a text editor. So I was overjoyed to be playing an innovative new smaller title that actually did things right!\n\nThen I actually started playing... and found things weren't quite as well implemented as they seemed, which this review formerly ranted about. Yet now I find, barely a day or two later, that they've already patched to fix them! Full points to ACE for rapid support! The controls, keybinding options and on-screen prompts are now top-tier, better than most games out there and leaving me nothing to complain about.\n\nWhich means I should really find something more to say about the game itself...\n\nBut for now I'll stick to my previous summation: "I'm immensely enjoying it, despite being quite terrible at it."","July 16, 2014","true","7.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's got many interesting aspects and if you're thinking about buying this, then go for it, you won't regret it. I will however give you a heads up.\n\nAs someone who plays online A LOT, as you might guess I have friends all over the world, while most games are fine across the world, this game falls into the catagory of low latency required. Even though it's only a co-op game, and that would allow for a much better netcode, the devs have gone for something that doesn't compensate for lag well at all.\nIf you join a game with a high ping, expect to fall though floors, hit/get hit often by your co-op mate. In general you're in for a bad time. This all would be a non-issue if friendly fire wasn't needed on, but if you want your progress to contribute, then you're going to need to keep it on.\n\nIt's only a small issue in an otherwise very good game.","July 31, 2014","true","18.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Provided that you've captured/bought their souls\n+Looks good graphic wise\n+When you die, you'll play as a soldier. As a soldier, you have a chance to revive you character at an altar, which is sometimes rare to come by.\n+Online coop\n+Community based objective. Don't know what the surprise it, but everytime a player defeat the warlock, it takes away a little chunk of the warlock's mask.\n\nThe bad:\n\n-It seems that the developer cannot make their mind whether to make a roguelike game or a roguelite. The gold you earned in a playthrough are carried over, but the items you bought from the merchants are not. In a single playthrough, you can get about less than 10,000 golds. A level 3 sword cost more than 10,000. This means that you need to save golds from multiple playthrough to get a decent weapon.\n\nHowever, you can complete the game without buying any trinkets/upgrades from the merchant. This is because none of your purchase from the merchant makes any significant difference in your playthrough. Except healing and mana potions of course.\n\n-Platforming is a mess.\n-Intentional lagging when turning right/left.\n-Friendly fire in coop sours the experience because you can't simultaneously hack the hordes of enemies.  Most of the time you will sit idle in a corner while watching your coop partner doing all the job.\n\nAbout the combat, I can't really say it's a bad thing. Combat sure feels stiff. It's like doing mathematics while hacking your enemies because you need to plan first your combos before engaging an enemy. Nonetheless, there is some moves that you can spam/abuse to make the game easier. This easy to execute moves are balanced by the fact that enemies cannot be hit when they were knocked down, plus the AI is REALLY HARD in a hard difficulty level - they parry, block and dodge your attacks, and only attack when there is an opening.\n\nThis game is hard to recommend but I don't think it is a bad game. It takes a few tries to like Abyss Odyssey but when you master the "clunky" combat, you'll love it.","July 18, 2014","true","13.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a fantastic concept with a bit of a learning curve, a beautiful environmental art style, strange and macabre creatures and a superb soundtrack.\n\nAlso Ghost Monk can tombstone enemies a la Ganondorf which is the best thing ever.\n\nEDIT: Ghost Monk's tombstone is no longer the best thing ever, becoming the Warlock is the best thing ever.","July 18, 2014","true","33.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For what it is it's quite good.  The combat system is a great synthesis of a brawler and Smash Bros. style combat with a few twists, though it does take some getting used to.  The visuals and sounds are both good with some minor issues that don't really detract from the experience.  There are also some questionable design choices, such as the oft maligned "camp token" save system, but the game's easy enough to complete without needing them.\n\nMy issue is the length and longevity of the game.  I put about ten hours into the game, beat it with each of the three base characters and there's just not enough left in it to make replaying worthwhile.  It doesn't have the variety of most roguelikes to give it a  lot of replayability, there's just not enough characters, items, enemies, or floor layouts.  There's a harder difficulty you can play on and three seperate entrances to the abyss to start from, but I just don't think it justifies the fifteen dollar price tag.\n\nPick it up on sale and put your time into it and you'll find a game with deep combat but not enough longevity to make great use of it.

Many people attempt art'ish approach in games , some do it because of low budget, some because they think it fits the game , but rarely they succed. As someone who studied visual arts , trust me , this game looks goreous.\n\nEnemy design - tired ofgeneric foes you've seen in all those other games? Abyss Odyssey got you covered.\n\nStory - Since this is roguelite game, story is kept to the minimal , but what's there is really intriguing. As i understand game's mythology has something to do with Chile's mythology and it helps it a great deal\n\nWhat i thought was okey/good in this game :\n\nMusic - what's there is great , but there's not much of variety .\nHeroes - There are 3 . I've played with 2 so far. One is really boring, second one is really intersting so its 50/50 for now\nMaps - they are randomly generated and it shows from time to time , but compared to some other examples this is really on a good side\n\nWhat i thought ( personally ) could've been better :\n\nFighting system - didint quite like it. Was it bad? Depends on personal opinion mostly i think. It's wierd mix of realtime and turned based.You fight in real time but you cant cancel your actions ( except for few cancel action points you have ) which makes it sort of clunky and unresponsive .. but again , thats what they were going for i think.\n\nSo what do i think about Abyss Odyssey? I like it. I like it a lot. If fighting system would be designed in different way i would even go as far to say this is one of the better games i've played in recent years .\n\nFinal score 8,5/10 .","December 17, 2015","true","7.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nauya/recommended/255070/","nauya","Nauya","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nauya/","321 products in account","Abyss Odyssey, it's a game you'll have to get used to before you can really enjoy it.\n\nI'm not saying it's bad, this game is REALLY fun and rewarding especially once you've got a hang of the controls.\n\nThe game is paced like your average rogue-lite these days, delve into a dungeon that's randomized everytime (although currently the biomes for the dungeon always stay the same) fight things to get exp and money, use money to buy weapons, potions, camp tokens (Checkpoints) along the way and try to reach the end to defeat the Warlock.\n\nHowever some bits stick out, the game lets you keep all your gold through all your runs so no matter how much you fail, you'll always have your gold to buy better gear at the start with. Another thing is that your level is kind of... Not integrated with Roguelike elements. Basically it kind of starts getting a bit more like an RPG where dieing is a part of the game until you get strong enough. Your level never resets, letting you grind until you can just beat the game by having too high of a level, which lets you have more and more HP.\n\nBUT! Then another element comes into play, where beating the game isn't the goal anymore. You see, this game has a "Capturing" system that lets you take the souls of monsters your level or below and transform into them. Your mindset shifts from "I want to beat the Warlock" to "I want to capture and BECOME the Warlock". Of course, the Warlock is at a high level, 70.\n\nNow, from a gaming standpoint without having played this or something with a similar "let you play as everything" system like Guardian Heroes, you'd think, "Why would I play as monsters? Aren't they usually weaker than players?" In Abyss Odyssey, everything has the potential to be as good and if not better than the three player characters. Especially considering how free form this game's mechanics are. By that, I mean there's no limits or gimmicks with anything. Every single enemy and also the players all apply to the same Smash Bros. like combat mechanics, so everything can be grabbed and thrown no matter if it's the final boss or a random goon or even the player, everything has the same amount of fighting moves (the Heroes have more but you can only equip 3 at a time), and every enemy and player feel like they are strong enough to be able to go through the game. Of course, later monsters and bosses are more powerful but nothing feels too much like super weak throw away trash.\n\nThis mechanic also works it's way into earlier gameplay as well because monsters you capture have their own seperate health bars, you can only have one monster soul at a time but the game lets you switch to them at any time so they can either give you another character to play as in that run totaling to 3 (Hero, Soldier, Monster) increasing your survivability and letting you delve deeper.\n\nOverall, I'd say this game is... Very niche. You have to like a lot of different game mechanics from various other games to really enjoy this. The game fights like Smash Bros. handles rogue-lites a bit like Rogue Legacy, platforms through dungeon areas like a Metroid-vania, lets you play as anything in the game (except small bugs that die in 1 hit) like Guardian Heroes or Code of Princess, and it also has Three Player Co-op with three characters that handle very differently almost giving it a Trine-ish feel, especially with the Art style.\n\nIf all of that in a jumble seems really awesome to you, there's no way you won't like this game, but if all of that sounds like it'd clash and make everything awkward and the game kind of... just flat out weird, I'd avoid it.\n\nStill, for only $15, it's got enough content to match if not, surpass it's price point. Especially with the new content that was slyly promised for everyone beating the Warlock enough times.\n\n[EDIT]\nFriendly fire is now toggleable but if you have it off you won't contribute to breaking the Warlocks mask. Think of it like a practice mode.\n\nDungeon variety could still use some more randomization since Biomes are still stationary, otherwise, it's a pretty enjoyable experience, especially with a friend.","July 16, 2014","true","12.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I mean, it looks like a Metroidvania with multiple characters and it's made by Atlus.  Impulse-bought.\n\nHaving said that, it's not a true Metroidvania, but I'll get to that in a second.\n\n-Similar games:  Azure Tower, 2D Castlevania games, Rogue Legacy\n\nPros:\n\n-The art and animations are BEAUTIFUL.  I mean, really gorgeous.  All the assets.  Sound is also fantastic, the guitar strings are particularly well done and haunting.\n\n-Jumping/Double-jumping are spot on, a must for a platformer.\n\n-The combat system is deceptively simple and can be compared to your standard fighting game.  Attacking, specials, block and grab for any opponent who is blocking.  The best part is that ALL the enemies have these abilities, and you had better believe that if you're leaning on that block button too hard, you're going to get throw and probably comboed.  Best enemy combat for this kind of game I have ever seen.\n\n-One of the core game mechanics is to switch your character with a monster you have captured - they then have their own fighting moves as listed above, and there are versus and co-op modes where you can adventure with a friend or fight them, and the playing field is relatively even no matter what character/monster you choose.\n\n-Upon death, you respawn as a city guard and have to fight your way to the nearest altar to resurrect into your main character.  Pretty innovative, though the guards could be a little better at jumping.\n\n-ZERO BUGS.  Phenomenally clean release.  Altus keeps up the quality.\n\nCons:\n\n-Though this looks like a Metroidvania in the trailer, it's not.  All the levels in the abyss are generic platforming sections with traps - your standard fare.  The backgrounds, though they change, do not affect the level play one iota - no monster is specific to a level theme unless you count the frozen fish.  So it's basically reskins all the way down the abyss, and there's no innovation in the level design at all.\n\n-The levels of experience are almost inconsequential.  Once you become good at the fighting system, this game becomes much easier, and I didn't notice much difference in the levels going down once I became semi-decent at getting combos.\n\n-Even though the game includes a training mode, this game could have benefitted from a tutorial and there was ample opportunity (with ALL, not just some, of the control scheme and abilities you have right off the bat) to present one in the prologue.  For example, I did not know I would dodge using the left and right shoulder buttons until I saw it in the menu, since the game only tells you to use the block+direction method.\n\nNeutral:\n\n-The story is sorta meh.  I get what they were going for, but there's no storytelling impact in finding random journal pages.  Outside of the intro wherein the heroine explains what she is and her purpose through expositional dialogue, I encountered almost no storyline in my playtime.\n\nBottom line:  This game lives and dies on its fighting mechanic and ability to switch characters, and thankfully this is executed really well.  Though all the levels are pretty much interchangable and uninspiring, the challenge is constant and fast-paced, and unlocking new characters is rewarding even if obtaining them can be difficult.  Recommended at its current price, and can't wait to play co-op and versus.","July 21, 2014","true","15.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Iggyhopper/recommended/255070/","Iggyhopper","Brownittoya","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Iggyhopper/","302 products in account","I see a lot of people having problems with the controls, let me justify.\n\nAside from the game being ABSOLUTELY beautiful in both sound, art, and mechanic design (I’ll get to this later), the controls are evidently the tipping point for how much the average person enjoys this game.\n\nFirst of all, don’t play using a keyboard\nSecond of all, in my experience the xbone controller is great with this game\nThird of all, stop complaining about what you can’t utilize well\n\nI will explain, but first, some background; I first played through dark souls with a mouse and keyboard. it wasn’t very hard at all. I just had to get used to the control scheme and visually map out what my hands would do the instant a certain action on the screen would occur. From here I gained and eventually had strong instinct in my movement, even while enduring the hardest of boss battle patterns I’ve come across in dark souls.\n\nThe problem that most people have in related to the controls of dark souls in using a keyboard, is that nothing works well and it requires too much thought to map out the visual que to the hand movements. Say jumping from windows 7 to windows 8 for instance, everything is better in windows 8 (EVERYTHING) but the ones who enjoy it in the end have a inky dinky windows 7 start menu program running and the ones who really don’t enjoy it say so because the god damn start menu is different. (Insofar, people who enjoy DS use a controller because it presents a much easier learning curve)\n\nI feel it too\n\nWith these example scenarios (I could go on but I digress), the problem in the controls lies within a deep crevasse that in some way, disjoints the expectation of combat, and the reality. Being a super smash bros player for quite some time, I can tell that there are a lot of scenarios involving a much too specific time frame in executing an attack in order to fight proficiently. For the time I have spent playing this game, I may have encountered 6-7 situations where I actually feel sluggish because I instinctually committed to my next attack when an odd ending buffer proceeding an attack was still activated and overlaid the next button I pressed. I ended up falling to the ground, having done nothing as an enemy stands beside me.\n\nThis sluggishness I felt really threw me for a loop as I did not expect it, but this doesn’t mean I can’t understand it. Every time this scenario happened I understood exactly how the mess of me losing 400 hp in a style uncanny to that of Oedipus's downfall came about.\n\nThe style I would assume most people desire is that of faster paced action and blazing up enemies that were weak, and having a challenging time calculating the pattern of the strong enemies. This does not happen in this game. Period. The AI, somewhat fun to play with, tend to predict your next action right as you commit to it, and this requires deep thought into what would make this fight easier for you. At this point, I fireball a guy and he dashes towards me then I jab him, I think this would start to get boring if I put in a couple more hours. Back to the point though, most people would not think of this as an actual technique in the fight as it involves subconsciously predicting the systematic error that the developer created for the AI. The AI is incredibly bad in a sense that they know what move you might pull within a millisecond and so most people would do away with trying to efficiently combat this systematic error. "Fix the [heartheartheart] controls" is the next thought process because in order to combat the AI at this point is to have luck, hardcore desire for achieving, and deep active thinking. I don’t mean to undermine anyone who think the controls produce a steeper than normal learning curve (because they do), I’m just saying that it can still be learned even in an environment as effective as this game's, and learn it I did.\n\nBut who has time for deep critical thinking when I just want to play games? let’s just give up right now because pressing the controls feel sluggish and between each attack, filled with hundreds of milliseconds (in a sense, bear with me) in desync between the user calculating his next move and emulating near instinct for enemies' patterns is morally crushing as they just come right back at you with a simple, 1 turn 100% prediction. Its psychological at this point in how people feel towards the combat of this game as well as its perceived sluggishness (maybe I’m just a good player as I only had 6-7 occasions where I wasn’t proficient (because of the desync, in which I noticed) in dealing with enemies up in the air, beside me, and/or firing a projectile at me at the same time)\n\nRun ons for days, boys, because this game is actually really good and unfortunately the enjoyment in its combat is based on how the average person deals with its near necessities. It may seem like I’m saying the combat is restrictive, but it’s not.\n\nThe sheer mechanical design in terms of the games combat intricacies and how each ability/movement is nearly woven with the next alongside the characters in which envelope the quilt, pleases me greatly. It does so because in getting past the debilitative learning curve in learning why you feel so sluggish, the combat starts to open up new opportunities for combos because you start to feel relieved that you don’t actually suck at the game and you don’t tilt as much (tilting would lead to one mashing buttons and none of them would actually make a pattern here as a byproduct of how the combat system works). You can weave your own patterns and still be effective against a part of the systematic error within the AI. This is what, in my opinion, allows for the winning edge to be had in most fights in both actually winning fair and square, and feeling good about it. I see many people saying how they just smash and bash their enemies against the wall because it’s… [Necessary I suppose?]\n\nI feel this correlates to how people feel in the keyboard controls of dark souls and in switching from windows 7 to windows 8. One, because the learning curve for both are so steep that some don’t even want change in the first place (dark souls: take me back to where I have a controller in third person please. windows 7-8: take me back where there’s a start menu that I "learned" how to use my entire life please.) you see my point?\n\nthere is an artificial learning curve for this game caused in the developer's lack of forethought (these are probably very inaccurate accusations, sorry cool guy/guys who enjoy actively updating this game in order to get out of the 68% (now 67%) rating crap hole) that has been evidently present because people don’t want to learn why things happen and just want to do what they already know.\n\nThose are pretty much my thoughts on why the general player base feels the need to act out and state why they feel that the controls are so bad (thanks for being vague guys, rock on).\n\nAlso, I love the otherworldly kind of phases in which you change into a character (such as a skeleton or metal golem, or something else I’ve only gone through 2 of these zones) with a completely different move set as the walls and ground tremble in a sweet droopy mess  around you in a unique black and white fixture.\n\nConcluding Statement\n\nI give this game a 9/10, with a 10/10 sufficing if not for the negative connotation provided by unfortunate souls who can’t take 3 seconds to assess the games current abstract situation. (Much as dark souls with keyboard or windows 8 with metro theme/tiles)\n\nI'm going to buy this game now, thanks awesome developer(s?) for your hard work. I hope that through my means this post does not offend you in your ways of bringing such a great overall feel and concept alive.

I had high hopes for it, but I felt the game play was clunky, and had a moderate level of bugs.\n\nClunkiness:\nThe simple act of jumping on ledges or platforms is needlessly difficult.  Often times it takes me 5 attempts or more to jump up a wall just to progress to the next area.  Fighting, in my opinion, doesn't feel skill-based, it just feels random.  I am still a novice at the game, but speaking as someone who has a degree in animation I felt that the enemies lack anticipation and signals that might give you queues on how to fight them. Blocking, dodging, throwing, attacking- they all seem instant and unpredictable, so fights end up feeling more like a dice roll than anything you can handle skillfuly.\n\nBugs:\nA friend and I were attempting to play co-op, but we had to host the game 4 times before it was even remotely playable.  Typically we'd load up the game, and one of us wouldn't be able to see enemies or platforms.  Even when we resolved this issue, one of us still wouldn't be able to see certain in game items like keys.\n\nDesign:\nI'm not a fan of the segmented stages (Metroid like), mainly because each individual stage doesn't seem to have a purpose or goal.  You progress through one stage,  kill a few guys, maybe see a vendor- and then the stage ends with out any real kind of punctiation.  What is the purpose of splitting the game up into these segments if each one is the same as the one before it. There are unique encounters, but they are far too rare.","October 16, 2014","false","15.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I can't recommend it unless you can get it on sale cheap enough like I did. It was $5 in the 2015 summer sale and I had like $1.25 in my wallet so I got it dirt cheap. Don't pay over $7.50 (50% off) for it because it is only about 3-4 hours long. The problem with buying it cheap is that after the summer sale it will probably never go on sale again less than $7.50, which even seeing that price is rare. The other problem is that once you beat it, there is not very much replay value. I had the game on my steam and isthereanydeal.com watch lists for several months before it finally went cheap enough. I already knew it was a short game but I thought it might have some replay value. It does a little, but not as much as I was hoping.\n\nAt any rate, it is a very enjoyable game for one or two playthroughs, provided you are willing to adapt to its purposely sluggish controls and incredibly cheap enemy combo attacks, even when you are helpless on the ground. When you figure out what moves to spam on what characters to spam combos and knockdowns, do not hesitate to be as cheap as humanly possible to enemies because that is how they are to you. I've seen a lot of reviews complaining about the sluggish controls and how long it takes you to turn around. While not being able to turn around instantly can sometimes lead to you taking a cheap hit, it is easily overcome-able once you get used to the fighting system. The controls for the monk are noticeably more sluggish than the girl's because he has bigger slower attacks with a 2h sword. The girl is fast and can get in and pull off moves quickly enough to wreck groups of enemies. Sometimes enemies can ground combo you several times, making it super cheap, and sometimes the cheap hits can get you in trouble before you can get to the last boss, but overall it was not much of a problem for me. My first time to the boss he crushed me mercilessly because he has some of the most annoying, cheap, unpredictable attacks I've ever seen any enemy have. All bosses in this game do, and some of the enemies as well. The second time I played through the game and got to him I beat him by working him over as much as I could with the girl's spinning attack, working the cheap move option in my favor as much as I possibly could, because if I didn't, he sure would've.\n\nFor the first 3 hours the game seemed really hard and a bunch of times I was getting pretty frustrated, but always having fun. When I got the combat down pretty good, hours 3-4 were much easier and I found the game to be considerably much easier than I had first thought.\n\nThe graphics are good but the game really shines with its awesome art style, mainly in the design of the characters and enemies. The music and sound effects are done nicely as well. Everything flows really smooth too. Once I got the hang of combat I was using the way the character animations flow to my advantage to look for tells when I could hit and when I should block. Which like I said means jack sh-t though on bosses because they are extraordinarily cheap and unpredictable.\n\nIt is too bad it is so short, but that is the fate of most indie games. For what it is worth, catch it on sale for no more than 50% its normal price. The short time you do have with it will be fun, and you might even want to play through it again as a different character. The sluggish combat and cheap enemy attacks, and your own ability to spam cheap hits, makes the game pretty much a one way street. A better more well thought out fighting system may have helped this game to a 7, maybe even 8, out of ten.\n\nLength 5/10\nArt/Sound/Music 8/10\nAnimations 10/10\nGameplay 7/10\nReplay value 3/10\nHot chicks with big knockers 10/10\nOverall 6.5/10","June 19, 2015","true","9.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","3"

Similar in a number of ways to Rogue's Legacy, both in setting and in mechanics, you start the game with one of three characters who, upon death will need to restart with only the default weapon and no items.  However, you do get to keep your levels, your special maneuvers and your gold.  This is important because you'll need to build up a store of gold in order to purchase camp tokens- these are required for save points throughout the Abyss.  Fortunately, while the better weapons are, of course, useful, the combat system is such that you don't *need* to have that level 14 sword over the level 10 sword you start with.  You can get by on your own if you want to save the coin.\n\nThe special attacks, meanwhile, cost no mana, which is a great aid and allows you to freely incorporate them into your combat style.  In fact, the attacks, which have a great deal of range- just the first two are a fireball and a jumping overhead arc with your sword- *build* your mana.  The only thing that appears, thus far, to consume your magic is the assimilation of your enemies, and that can only be done when you have a full mana counter.\n\nWhile I'm on the topic, one immediate con: so far as I've seen, you can only ever have one such enemy assimilated at a time.  There's no library of shapes you can shift into, which is disappointing, but the mechanic still does add some interesting variety to the game, as well as present you with a means of surviving (monster forms have full health when you first shift into them, giving your main character a respite).\n\nOf course, the most striking thing about the game, and what likely drew you to it in the first place- it's gorgeous.  Every character is individually painted and rendered and it looks beautiful.  The settings do not disappoint.  It's a lovely game and easy on the eyes.\n\nMetroidvania is going to be the watchword for any review- the game clinches it.  The fighting style, though, brings to mind something closer to fighting games.  Some enemies are setting-dressing, and you'll finish them off quickly.  Others, though, have a more dramatic flair, with the screen darkening at the borders and preventing you from advancing or retreating until the enemies are dead.  Fortunately, you are not without allies- the soldiers who are policing the hole leading into the Abyss have come down with and ahead of you.  They can easily pop up during a fight to lend a hand, an axe or a gun.\n\nControls are not as tight as I would like.  The right joystick both operates to pick up and interact with things, if you press it in, and has limited operation in moving and attacking.  However, because it's sensitive to that movement, you have to be careful about pushing it when you're in combat.  Further, even out of combat and away from a tense screen of platforming, you're going to be frustrated with figuring out which button, the direction pad or left joystick, actually has to be pressed to set your special attacks.  These are relatively minor in the scheme of things, but they add an unnecessary frustration.\n\nOverall the game is fun, and I wasn't surprised to see how quickly I was engrossed.\n\n7/10- will interrupt Skyrim to play.","July 16, 2014","true","11.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Fast falling, variety of moves (most platform fighters forget directions such as neutral and back for aerials, Abyss Odyssey didn't), dash cancelling for fast paced movement, the cancel system which brings tons of variability into combos, and C-STICKING (being able to perform moves with the right stick, which allows things such as retreating forward aerial attacks possible), which is a huge plus.\n\nThe single player is really just a plus for me, and a way to unlock characters. The fact that you unlock characters by capturing enemies is super neat in my opinion.\n\nI really hope this game takes off, because it's well worth the $15.","July 16, 2014","true","38.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Once you get the hang of it you'll be stomping baddies into the ground with combinations of aerial attacks, special moves and dashing. Decent replay value as there's 3 characters, each with an ability that captures enemies to tag-out and use in place of your hero. Once you run out of "lives" you have to start over, the dungeon resets but you keep all gold earned (so you can buy epic weapons early).\n\nWithout saying too much, I expected more from the end of this game but it didn't ruin the experience.","July 16, 2014","true","13.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

With some customization, you can create your own combos while levelling up, choosing to add special abilities that will, if well chosen, make your combos longer.\n\nBeing able to transform into enemies and monsters is also really fun. Each monsters have their own combo sets and special abilities. I'm a little saddened by the fact that these do not have levels and customization of their own, but them having a different Health bar can be very useful.\n\nThe game is pretty hard. Until reaching a higher level, dying every time you enter a Hard floor isn't too surprising. Dodging and blocking is fully needed for survival. Jumping and grappling will also help a lot. Co-op mode is sadly very limited. Although it's fun, the camera always centers between both characters, and when a player goes too far, they disappear off-screen and can make things complicated. Friendly fire is also always on, and makes for very cautious battles, while enemies are not always affected by this.\n\nAll in all, the game is fun, but better to play solo, (Unless playing in Versus mode, which is like playing a fighting game with the characters unlocked through the story) unless you and your friend are used to difficult/fighting games.\n\nEdit: The first patch will attend to some problems, as well as change something related to friendly fire being too harsh.","July 16, 2014","true","3.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

While the game's art direction, soundtrack and lore is charming and invigorating, the combat system plays much closer to an arcade fighter. Say goodbye to spectacle fighters' button-mashing and brawlers' single-button win-strategies. Abyss Odyssey's combat forces you to think before you act and make each move count. From zoning enemies using projectiles, to frame-canceling attacks into special moves.\nFor all the good the game does, its tutorial is sparse and lacking, and puts players into the hotseat of "die and learn".\nThe game's difficulty isn't excessive, with a single clear taking as little as a few hours of trial and error (your mileage may vary). If the game suffers from one single problem, it's the blatant input-reading that goes on during certain encounters. While this adds to the overall difficulty of the game, it's hard to tell whether an enemy is "smart", or simply cheating.","July 21, 2014","true","3.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Most of their titles are either hit or miss, and I've been flipping back and forth but it looks more and more like this game has more promise than I initially thought.  Abyss Odyssey is a mashup of Metroidvania-style level navigation, roguelike aspects to finding items and the construction of the abyss, Prince of Persia-style level dangers, and a combat system that is some smooth fusion of Dark Souls' one-on-one and dodge/defense heavy action and side-scrolling fighting games.  There's a clunkiness to character movement that compels you to learn move distances and timing, so every moment of battle is tense and exhilarating.  There's also permanent death in the roguelike fashion, but as so much of your success is going to hinge on your own ability rather than what you gain along the way, it doesn't matter too much if you die and you should expect to die a lot.  Money is carried over between lives, as are character levels, but a lot of items are ridiculously expensive and it's often better just to thoroughly plumb the abyss for your powerups.\n\nInitially you play as one avatar, and you unlock two more (with their own advantages and disadvantages).  This sets itself up to be very limited, at least until you find that you can purchase or steal monster souls (with a special mana power attack that takes a long time to charge) which lets you wear their forms and use their attacks, effectively using their souls as a meat shield for a little while.  This is nice and adds a ton of variety to the fighting system.\n\nThese features alone wouldn't hold my interest in the game, but I've noticed that it has a drop-in and drop-out online multiplayer.  Since I first purchased the game, they've released a patch to let people choose whether or not to enable friendly fire.  Friendly fire is enabled by default, and it introduces an interesting dynamic to online games;  You have to learn how to keep your space from your partner and learn how to block and dodge effectively so that you don't take the damage that's meant for the enemies.\n\nMy only complaint is that there is still a lot of patching for ATLUS to do for this to be a game as solid as it promises itself to be.  There is no way to determine your latency to online games right now, and if you're too laggy, the desynchronization is very much not pretty:  You constantly fall through floors, and are stuck in a mid-jump animation glitching in and out of the floor.  Good luck jumping or even trying to fight.  I hope this is resolved soon, because if you can get into a game with low latency and a considerate and dangerous partenr, this game is a great way to kill a weekend or few.","July 19, 2014","true","17.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Addictive, too, with its share of good and bad.\n\nThe Good\n\nYou'll find yourself getting lost in the visuals.\nChallenging game, so you won't be able to plow through it in a single sitting.\nReplay factor is exceptionally high, with multiple characters and gameplay styles.\nOnline co-op, since it's hard to find decent games with this feature (for me, at least).\nLots of different mini-bosses.\nNightmare mode keeps you from getting bored.\n\n\nThe Bad\n\nIt's hard.  Brutally hard, especially when you're first starting out.  Expect to die quite a bit.\nFor a rogue-ish game, fully dying or completing a playthrough may take the better part of a couple of hours or so, and the limited save mechanic isn't going to help you there.\nNo hand holding, especially when it comes to game mechanics.  If you want to know how to do something from the start of the game, you had better read the instructions, completely.  Even then, you'll be discovering things that you didn't know you could do, and things which seem intuitive are not (e.g. Save Token III means you'll get help from three guys, not that you'll be able to use it three times).\nStory is a bit light, but I'm not finished with the game yet, so it may get a bit deeper.  Still, the story to date is a little thin.\nControls seem a bit unresponsive at times.  That said, I think it may be something where I was expecting Street Fighter-levels of control.  You get used to it.\nIf you want to both progress and do co-op, you need to enable friendly fire.  I'm not a fan of this, because if one character is getting his ♥♥♥ handed to him, you can't go over and help without possibly hurting him.  It may be an intentional thing, but I'm not thrilled.  The recent option change helped with this.\n\nAll in all, it's worth the purchase.  It may seem like I'm knocking it more than praising it, but it's only because the cons are like small obvious sore spots, whereas the game gets so many things right that it'd be a circle-jerk to list them all.  If you get past the first hour or so without getting frustrated (and really, just give it a shot), you'll easily put in another 10-15 or more, as I'm planning to.","July 28, 2014","true","12.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While the game is most fun in co-op, it  really seems like it was designed to be played single player.  For instance, until you unlock the alternate characters, you may have difficulty telling your character apart from your partner's.

The visuals are very artistic and well done.  I had to put the game down as I just found the double jump mechanism too much of a hassle to pull off.  You have to double jump a lot to get around obstacles and the point at which you have to hit the space button a second time to go higher and then go over, is just to small...I guess the float point in games that have this doulble jump.   It leads to, at least for me, to spending  minutes trying to get over one tall obstacle and jumping in one place over and over again.  Please do an update on this game and make characters jump just a bit higher more easily and or make the spot you have to hit the space bar a second time more forgiving.  Or make it that you just hold space to double jump to full height. Right now it just feels like they made something that should be relatively easy to pull off, unnessaarily difficult.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blendvai/recommended/255070/","blendvai","da  B man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blendvai/","408 products in account","Abyss is a dark fantasy game about adventurers going into the abyss to kill the demons and the warlock who summons them.\nPros: The game settings and atmosphere are beyond perfect. The animations are fluid and hard to predict for enemies. The skills are nicely varied and fun to fiddle with. You can dodge and block attacks. You can grab enemies out of their blocking positions. There are a lot of weapons you can collect. Dying results in playing an army bro who you have to reach to the nearest shrine to resurrect your character. If you fail to do this, you lose all items collected, and go to a dark death room where you can change character, allocate skill points and choose which entrance point to start in, so it doesn't feel like permadeath as much since you keep your current level and health amount, but losing gear and weapon is still punisher enough that you will work hard not to die. There are multiple characters and creatures you get to play, which is never boring, as some are quite unique to use. There's also a "training" option in the main menu that you can choose only to practice using skills with certain characters, it does not actually train you on how to play the game. The game does not hold your hand, and you are forced to find things out on your own, there is a "How to Play" in the options menu under "Help", which I will strongly recommend checking out as you will not find any other way of doing things. Personally, I think that's a pro, but can also be seen as a con.\n\nCons: Expect a challenge if you're set on playing this with a friend. The friendly fire is annoying at best, and the lag is ludicrous sometimes. The skills that you loved in single player are much harder to use when there's the CONSTANT risk of hitting your partner and feeling like an idiot. What's worse is sometimes the enemies will all dodge you skills, so even if you sandwiched the enemies, you still have a good chance of hurting your partner. That having been said, it makes it more difficult, frustrating, and yet oddly enjoyable to master with a friend, or kill eachother trying. The jumping does NOT improve the situation. There's a glitch, or rather, a difficulty with the programming where the player attempts to jump up onto a ledge and the programming cannot decide if it should jump onto the ledge or slide along the ledge, this causes the player to keep attempting to jump onto the ledge without success until they finally get it. I'm not sure to what purpose the ability to slide down ledges was added, but it's not nearly as useful as CLIMBING A LEDGE. I'm holding back a lot of rage on the matter, as with multiplayer games you will look the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ over and over again as you just can't make that jump, and your partner will be waiting for you... or you will be waiting for them to try and climb that god forsaken ledge that only took you one or a couple of attempts. There is no real tutorial in the game, and there should be. Even dark souls had a little tutorial on what to press and how to do certain things, especially when those skills are unique to the game (enemy capture!!!). The story is a little like dark souls as it does not go into much detail on why things are the way they are, and what exactly is happening in the game, which could be a game design choice as was with dark souls, so it's only a Con if it bothers you. Any other cons I could pitch off to my horrible skill in side scrollers/fighting games, so I will not mention them.\n\nThanks for reading my review!","November 9, 2014","true","7.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Seriously, I was a bit upset after playing it for the first time after buying it, but once I learned how to pull off certain combos, it grew on me like a bad case of hemmorrhoids. In a good way, of course. As of this writing, I only have an hour of play time in and there's a reason for that. My only beef with the game is that it's so unforgiving. An hour's worth of gameplay, and I have made so little progress, people have started nominating me for a position in the federal government. In order to respawn anywhere other than the starting area, you need a camp token. Where do you find them? Hell if I know. Some merchants (very few and far between) will sell one and only one, but they're ridiculously high, and you lose them permanently if you die. On rare occasions, you may stumble across one, but don't hold your breath. If you die (and you will die) you get one chance to respawn by means of fighting as a soldier until you reach an activated check point. My problem is that I've only found three tokens, of which I lost two, and my only activated checkpoint is a hell of a way away from anywhere I need or want to be.\n\nIn conclusion, get it, but be prepared to punch-proof your monitor","November 29, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can see from the screenshots: giant peacock warriors, creatures with glowing circulatory systems exposed, and this variety permeates down to each of their charactistic move sets. The whole game is immensely, impeccably stylish, with surreal and dream like colour and variety - yet somehow it all makes a coherent vision, with everything underwritten by art nouveau stylings and Chilean culture and folklore.\n\nCombat was extremely satisfying; skillful and involving. And progression down through the levels felt substantial but forgiving of failure. Playing carefully, each death is a setback rather than game over, though die too many times and you will be forced further and further back towards the surface until you have no respawn options left. It's a perfect example of punishing but fair game design, the combat and death system both.\n\nIt was a delight to play and a rich and fascinating world to explore.

It's like Rogue Legacy, Torchlight, and Smash Bros mechanics jumbled into a pile and painted by Castlevania's lead artist. I recommend it if you like dungeon crawlers and rogue-lites. Someone explained that it was like a metroidvania, but really it's not at all. It's an infinite dungeon crawler, which changes every time you die. The attack/dodge mechanics feel pretty stiff unfortunately. Attacking is done in combos by pressing the attack button or special attack with directions in certain patterns similar to Smash Brothers. Even more similarities include shielding, rolling, fast falling, attack-cancelling, short-hopping, and grabbing. Most of which really slow down the game and make it slog a bit when progressing in fights. Enemies can do all of these things too, which makes it really frustrating when there are four on a screen at a time all attacking or shielding you. What's really pulling me to play more is the art style which looks beautiful.\n\nIn the end what's here isn't a perfect gem, but it does have some pulling game elements.

I really enjoy this game. The character and level designs alone are worth at least looking at YouTube videos of the game. The game itself is pretty fun to play on top of that. I'm really not the biggest rougue-like fan out there, but this one has me.\n\nOn the positive side the combat is fun. It's not at all natural in how the characters turn. That is a giant flaw in the system, but when you figure out ways around it that combat flows really well and it's very satisfying to start laying in the combos. It's fun to swap out with an enemy that you've captured as well. Some of them are much better than others (like my personal favorite, the merchant). Some of them you can switch over and just take control of pretty much any fight. Some of them you switch to them and realize the only way the game could make that enemy challenging is if the game was reading my key imputs before deciding it's next move. Because some of these enemies are pretty awful to play as (like the boss with a sword for it's nose). Even then, just find enemies that work well with your play style and you'll be fine.\n\nI sort of put a couple of negatives in the review already, and really they're the only big ones. Sure the last boss could be more difficult, but I don't really mind the difficulty where it is. I haven't tried nightmare mode yet, but it seems like it's just a suped up version of the regular game, which is fine with me. I think the biggest thing working against the game is in the limited number of items and enemies. There's a good amount, but not that many. From what I can see there's three weapons for each element, a handful of trinkets and maybe... 25 or 35 enemy types. Ish. More variety would be nice. It seems like there are some characters missing too. The page where you choose a character has plenty of room for at least one more character, but it doesn't seem like there is one. Which is a shame.\n\nIf you were already interesting in this game you should just get it. It's a solid game that's definitely worth adding to your library. If you're looking for a rogue-like that has as many options as something like Rogue Legacy you might want to go some place else.","January 11, 2015","true","10.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Most of their titles are either hit or miss, and I've been flipping back and forth but it looks more and more like this game has more promise than I initially thought.  Abyss Odyssey is a mashup of Metroidvania-style level navigation, roguelike aspects to finding items and the construction of the abyss, Prince of Persia-style level dangers, and a combat system that is some smooth fusion of Dark Souls' one-on-one and dodge/defense heavy action and side-scrolling fighting games.  There's a clunkiness to character movement that compels you to learn move distances and timing, so every moment of battle is tense and exhilarating.  There's also permanent death in the roguelike fashion, but as so much of your success is going to hinge on your own ability rather than what you gain along the way, it doesn't matter too much if you die and you should expect to die a lot.  Money is carried over between lives, as are character levels, but a lot of items are ridiculously expensive and it's often better just to thoroughly plumb the abyss for your powerups.\n\nInitially you play as one avatar, and you unlock two more (with their own advantages and disadvantages).  This sets itself up to be very limited, at least until you find that you can purchase or steal monster souls (with a special mana power attack that takes a long time to charge) which lets you wear their forms and use their attacks, effectively using their souls as a meat shield for a little while.  This is nice and adds a ton of variety to the fighting system.\n\nThese features alone wouldn't hold my interest in the game, but I've noticed that it has a drop-in and drop-out online multiplayer.  Since I first purchased the game, they've released a patch to let people choose whether or not to enable friendly fire.  Friendly fire is enabled by default, and it introduces an interesting dynamic to online games;  You have to learn how to keep your space from your partner and learn how to block and dodge effectively so that you don't take the damage that's meant for the enemies.\n\nMy only complaint is that there is still a lot of patching for ATLUS to do for this to be a game as solid as it promises itself to be.  There is no way to determine your latency to online games right now, and if you're too laggy, the desynchronization is very much not pretty:  You constantly fall through floors, and are stuck in a mid-jump animation glitching in and out of the floor.  Good luck jumping or even trying to fight.  I hope this is resolved soon, because if you can get into a game with low latency and a considerate and dangerous partenr, this game is a great way to kill a weekend or few.","July 19, 2014","true","17.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Brutally hard, especially when you're first starting out.  Expect to die quite a bit.\nFor a rogue-ish game, fully dying or completing a playthrough may take the better part of a couple of hours or so, and the limited save mechanic isn't going to help you there.\nNo hand holding, especially when it comes to game mechanics.  If you want to know how to do something from the start of the game, you had better read the instructions, completely.  Even then, you'll be discovering things that you didn't know you could do, and things which seem intuitive are not (e.g. Save Token III means you'll get help from three guys, not that you'll be able to use it three times).\nStory is a bit light, but I'm not finished with the game yet, so it may get a bit deeper.  Still, the story to date is a little thin.\nControls seem a bit unresponsive at times.  That said, I think it may be something where I was expecting Street Fighter-levels of control.  You get used to it.\nIf you want to both progress and do co-op, you need to enable friendly fire.  I'm not a fan of this, because if one character is getting his ♥♥♥ handed to him, you can't go over and help without possibly hurting him.  It may be an intentional thing, but I'm not thrilled.  The recent option change helped with this.\n\nAll in all, it's worth the purchase.  It may seem like I'm knocking it more than praising it, but it's only because the cons are like small obvious sore spots, whereas the game gets so many things right that it'd be a circle-jerk to list them all.  If you get past the first hour or so without getting frustrated (and really, just give it a shot), you'll easily put in another 10-15 or more, as I'm planning to.","July 28, 2014","true","12.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The combat closely resembles a Street Fighter style fighting mechanic, and by default, friendly fire is on.  That gives the co-op a great deal of depth, and requires partners to use screen space wisely and communicate well, but requires a great deal of patience.\n\nThe game has an unfortunate nubmer of bugs, some of them game breaking, which can ruin a otherwise exciting evening of play.  While the game is most fun in co-op, it  really seems like it was designed to be played single player.

Some enemies are quick and agile while other are large and slow with powerful or long range attacks. The ability to play as all of them except ghosts encourages you to learn how characters fight and counter them.\n\nNo two traps work the same and you are likely to fall for them.

But it does not change the difficulty, level type (like ice or jungle) and therefore the enemies you will fight in tha area, or the prescence of a mini-boss, so it is largely predictable.\n\nThe combat is exciting yet unforgiving.  The game locks you into enemy encounters with more than one enemy until youve killed some of them, which can lead to one versus four scenarios. In spite of that, enemies tend to engage one at a time unless you have nightmare difficulty turned on, so the challenge is not impossible.\n\nEnemy AI (except in 'easy' areas) knows how to utilize all of their moves and will likely punish you for using the same move twice, staying shielded for too long or shoot projectiles if youre running.

All of this studios games so far have been taking conventional gameplay and kinda twisting it.  I'll tell you right now that's why many people like this game, and that's why also there's lots of negative reviews. From the looks of it, this game is a platformer hack and slash, but its a platformer fighter which has caused people disappointment when the game is a lil too clunky or hard.  That's not to discredit legitimate peoples criticism of this game, sometimes you wish you could jump just a lil higher or hit a lil harder or be a lil more responsive. But that doesn't get in the way of enjoying the game if you arent turned off so far.  There's endless replayability here as you have 2 main characters to level up as well as a later unlockable third as you travel down 3 columns of procedurally generated levels. On top of that theres 2 reserver characters that come in if your main dies.  One of the main mechanics is the ability to capture souls, allowing you to switch back and forth between your main and this monster soul.  As far as I know, you can capture every enemy in the game including the last boss, and each one has its own set of moves, though you cannot level them up.   If you like Castlevania but want something a lil different and new, get this.  If you like fighters, get this.  If you like Super Smash Bros., or Rogue-likes then you NEED to get this game.  Throw in an incredible art style, intense music, and a really great Dev team, and you get a wonderfully unique experience of a game.

The combat was very easy to control and get used to and yet hard to master as any good fighting game should be. The Abyss that you go into is interesting and there are several characterrs you can meet who are all interesting in their own way. The three playable characters are fun to play as, as well.\n\nOne thing I don't like is the levelling up system, but this may only be me. You level up by getting EXP by kiling monsters in the Abyss and for every 3 levels you get a skill point that can be used to upgrade one of your 3 special attacks in 3 different ways. Or you can use it to get a permanent cancel which lets you rapidly use a special or dodge during attacks. This is all the variety you get. I would have enjoyed it better if you had a bigger variety of skills you can upgrade such as your attack or speed or ability to dodge or defense. This to me felt limited.\n\nA funny story though is as soon as I unlocked the second character, The Monk, I decided to play as him. I expected to die pretty quickly because that's what I had been doing with the first character. But as a level 1 character, who eventually reached level 19 by the end, managed to beat the whole Abyss and the last boss in my first try. I hadn't ever played as this character before and I beat the game first try. Whether this is good or bad, is up to you. Personally I think I was just lucky to have found so many health potions in the dungeon. I personally recommend this game as it was the first Rogue-like I actually liked. 4/5","September 7, 2015","true","13.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For this, a controller is a MUST for this game. If you don't have a controller, don't get this game (or get a controller.

You have also a grab and a shield.\n\nAs a roguelike, you unlock stuff even when you die, so each play you encounter different things and events and you advance in the story. When you die you take control of a guard, so you have a second chance to revive your main character and continue playing. You can also transform into different monster with their own healt bar.

You will casually hit your co-op partner over and over.\n\nSome enemies can be brutal, but there are more than enough ranged attacks and specials for you to cheese your way through the game. However, there is no better feeling than taking out an enemy using nothing but pure skill, and no worse feeling than going from full health to no health against a single enemy.\n\nAesthetically this game is awesome, with an art style similar to many of the developers previous games, realistic drawings accentuated with thick dark lines really pack a punch on your eyes.\n\nThe games basic mechanics involve the characters abilities to move around and attack, which the player will quickly master. I never got into the advanced mechanics and combos, but there are videos on YouTube of people doing crazy high combos, so there is an indepth fighting system if your into that. Plus, multiplayer battles against your friends! Another mechanic is the ability to take over and use a single enemy as an extra life of sorts, this could've been explained better, as I could never seem to get it to work.\n\nThis is a game that encourages multiple playthroughs, as there are so many characters to unlock, bosses to fight, and even a couple of weapons with elemental attributes. The ending is a little lackluster, but then again, what else could they have done.\n\nLevel layouts are mostly the same, even in different environments, which can lead to slightly repetitive gameply, and I feel that there was a lack of differing content in each run, as each time I went down to fight the warlock, I was basically doing the same thing.\n\nI DEFINATELY recommend playing this on easy and without friendly fire if your with someone.\n\nBest brother relationship destroyer Christmas and again on New Years 2014-2015.","January 15, 2015","true","7.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","2","4","3","0"

And this one is no exception.  It's an action platformer that supports online co-op. The art style, the music, the setting, it's all gorgeous, even if the story might feel too simple. I noticed some people complaining the controls were clunky, I think that doesn't do this game justice at all. The controls do feel heavy, but it sounds to me clear as day that it was a design decision. They didn't want to make another generic action game, they want you to think before attacking. Also, there are some really neat mechanics that help the game to stand out even more among other similar titles. My favorite one being releasing a charged attack that lets you "capture" an enemy and use him as a playable character in the current run. You're probably gonna chance characters a lot when running out of life in the lower levels (forgot to mention this game is all about venturing deep inside a dungeon to reach and kill an old man).

I'll be surprised if I can force myself into a few more hours of gameplay on it.\n\nIf you can pick it up for cheap, give it a shot! Chances are you might like it. If you dig Smash Bros style combat, you might dig this too.\n___\n\nSo, after rage quitting somewhere in my third NG+ attempt at Dark Souls, I've decided to go through my library, give all the games I've accumulated a fair shake. First up is Abyss Odyssey.\n\nFull disclosure, I got Abyss Odyssey because it was thrown in with a humble bundle, and I am playing it with a mouse and keyboard. I am also realizing this is less than ideal. My initial intention with it was to beat it before settling on a full opinion of it. That very quickly became "give it five hours." That has now become "an hour and a half might be enough."\n\nAbyss Odyssey isn't necessarily bad. It might even be good. Visually, it's actually pretty inviting - the setting is evocative and immersive, the full character illustrations are pretty neat. While the characters are very, very much broad strokes, that works for the setting. The narrative setting itself is also largely intriguing, as the player finds themselves delving into the dream of a slumbering warlock made reality in 1890's Chile. I can't call that anything but unique, especially with the character's confession that they too are a part of the dream. Between the visuals and the mysterious narrative context, Abyss Odyssey certainly motivates the player to explore.\n\nFurthermore, exploration is a big part of the game, with the world changing each time you enter the abyss. Each time you can find new items and try a different approach into a new version of the dream. It's really a cool idea.\n\nMy problem arises with the actual gameplay mechanics. All of this setting and presentation is well and good, but it serves merely as a backdrop for the meat of the game, which is side scrolling brawler / fighting game in the style of the adventure mode for things like Street Fighter. So as the player moves sideways and up and down through the abyss they are confronted with mobs of different dream creatures, which drop keys and health and mana and what have you.\n\nMy personal inclination is to to say the mechanics are horribly clunky. The character moves very slowly and feels unresponsive. Constructing actual combos and meaingfully positioning yourself feels cumbersome. Now, people have said elsewhere that this is essentially the combat mode from Smash Bros, which I can see, and I am terrible at and do not enjoy. It is possible that this game is very fulfilling for someone who takes to this style of gameplay, but I do not. So overall my verdict on the gameplay is that it is horribly frustrating and ungratifying. My attempts to acclimate myself to the play style were so heavily thwarted in my short attempts at the game that I can't bring myself to go any further, even given how inviting the world is. Which is a shame.\n\nSo. A beautiful, intruiging game world. Massively clunky and frustrating fighting game mechanics pitting you against hyper responsive AI - though this hinges on my sucking at this game. A platformer utilizing unresponsive and clunky movement. This to me constitutes Abyss Odyssey.\n\nNot necessarily bad. For someone who can make this game work, which I'm sure they're out there, it might even be a great game. But I am not that person.  I'll be surprised if I can force myself into a few more hours of gameplay on it.\n\nIf you can pick it up for cheap, give it a shot! Chances are you might like it.

Abyss Odyssey looked promising, the majority of the reviews are positive and after beating the abyss once and making the video, I have to say that I wholeheartedly agree.\n\nFirst off, the options menu is good. 3 seperate sliders for music, voice and soundeffects enhance the audio experience greatly. The graphical options are a bit limited, but well enough for this type of game.\n\nBefore venturing into the abyss, the game gives you a tutorial in which the default controls are shown. In case you forget what button to push, the controls can be looked at or, if you play with the keyboard, rebound even while you are venturing towards the warlock.\n\nAs we venture down the abyss the game shows itself in a really nice artstyle. The background looks nice, though there are only a few times in which you can't distinguish background from foreground. Speaking of art, the sounddesign in this is game is top notch, which may be a reason, why you can buy the soundtrack seperately.(not that you start thinking that the game is bad...)\n\nThrough the nice looking areas we go, as we are attacked by some monsters. First off, the game sure isn't shy about its variety on enemies, which you can all unlock as playable characters in training and versus mode as well. The combat itself is in my opinion the weakest point in the game. The animations feel sluggish and unresponsive, which is a shame because apart from that the combat system is quite nicely built, especially when interacting with the environment.\nNot only in the combat also during small plattforming sections the handling feels weird, but that might just be me.\n\nDue to the fact that you start off the story mode with one character and one starting zone, the replayability of the game is definitely there, especially when you want to unlock all characters. Another collectable are pages for the warlock's book(actual name not coming into my mind), which you can read, if you so desire.\n\n\nAnd again we are at the point of the tl:dr/tl:dw! Is it worth it? If you can forgive the game for giving you a bad feeling about the handling in terms of combat and plattforming, I'd say it's worth picking up for full price. When the game goes on sale(which it is until 7pm CEST, 16th of July), I wouldn't even hesitate buying it. And even if the handling feels weird and you can't be asked dealing with that, you can still buy the soundtrack, if you are into it.","July 16, 2014","true","3.6"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","5","10","2","0"

Some enemies are quick and agile while other are large and slow with powerful or long range attacks. The ability to play as all of them except ghosts encourages you to learn how characters fight and counter them.\n\nNo two traps work the same and you are likely to fall for them. Randomly generated areas change the location of terrain, traps, and goodies. But it does not change the difficulty, level type (like ice or jungle) and therefore the enemies you will fight in tha area, or the prescence of a mini-boss, so it is largely predictable.\n\nThe combat is exciting yet unforgiving.  The game locks you into enemy encounters with more than one enemy until youve killed some of them, which can lead to one versus four scenarios. In spite of that, enemies tend to engage one at a time unless you have nightmare difficulty turned on, so the challenge is not impossible.\n\nEnemy AI (except in 'easy' areas) knows how to utilize all of their moves and will likely punish you for using the same move twice, staying shielded for too long or shoot projectiles if youre running. Learning how to grab, air dodge, and special cancel is essential to fighting AI opponents.\n\nOne simple improvement they could have made is too give more options to getting up. Against humans opponents who can be fooled it wouldn't be a problem but AI opponents know where you will get up and then knock you over again.\n\nThe PC version suffers from the game having been developed for console. The controls are hard to get used to, and features like co-op and versus fall short. Co-op online even between two computers in the same room was prone to crash often. And although versus mode is great and you can play bots you probaly wont find games without friends who play it.","September 8, 2015","true","14.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

All of this studios games so far have been taking conventional gameplay and kinda twisting it.  I'll tell you right now that's why many people like this game, and that's why also there's lots of negative reviews. From the looks of it, this game is a platformer hack and slash, but its a platformer fighter which has caused people disappointment when the game is a lil too clunky or hard.  That's not to discredit legitimate peoples criticism of this game, sometimes you wish you could jump just a lil higher or hit a lil harder or be a lil more responsive. But that doesn't get in the way of enjoying the game if you arent turned off so far.  There's endless replayability here as you have 2 main characters to level up as well as a later unlockable third as you travel down 3 columns of procedurally generated levels. On top of that theres 2 reserver characters that come in if your main dies.  One of the main mechanics is the ability to capture souls, allowing you to switch back and forth between your main and this monster soul.  As far as I know, you can capture every enemy in the game including the last boss, and each one has its own set of moves, though you cannot level them up.   If you like Castlevania but want something a lil different and new, get this.  If you like fighters, get this.  If you like Super Smash Bros., or Rogue-likes then you NEED to get this game.  Throw in an incredible art style, intense music, and a really great Dev team, and you get a wonderfully unique experience of a game.

The combat was very easy to control and get used to and yet hard to master as any good fighting game should be. The Abyss that you go into is interesting and there are several characterrs you can meet who are all interesting in their own way. The three playable characters are fun to play as, as well.\n\nOne thing I don't like is the levelling up system, but this may only be me. You level up by getting EXP by kiling monsters in the Abyss and for every 3 levels you get a skill point that can be used to upgrade one of your 3 special attacks in 3 different ways. Or you can use it to get a permanent cancel which lets you rapidly use a special or dodge during attacks. This is all the variety you get. I would have enjoyed it better if you had a bigger variety of skills you can upgrade such as your attack or speed or ability to dodge or defense. This to me felt limited.\n\nA funny story though is as soon as I unlocked the second character, The Monk, I decided to play as him. I expected to die pretty quickly because that's what I had been doing with the first character. But as a level 1 character, who eventually reached level 19 by the end, managed to beat the whole Abyss and the last boss in my first try. I hadn't ever played as this character before and I beat the game first try. Whether this is good or bad, is up to you.

Visually, it's actually pretty inviting - the setting is evocative and immersive, the full character illustrations are pretty neat. While the characters are very, very much broad strokes, that works for the setting. The narrative setting itself is also largely intriguing, as the player finds themselves delving into the dream of a slumbering warlock made reality in 1890's Chile. I can't call that anything but unique, especially with the character's confession that they too are a part of the dream. Between the visuals and the mysterious narrative context, Abyss Odyssey certainly motivates the player to explore.\n\nFurthermore, exploration is a big part of the game, with the world changing each time you enter the abyss. Each time you can find new items and try a different approach into a new version of the dream. It's really a cool idea.\n\nMy problem arises with the actual gameplay mechanics. All of this setting and presentation is well and good, but it serves merely as a backdrop for the meat of the game, which is side scrolling brawler / fighting game in the style of the adventure mode for things like Street Fighter. So as the player moves sideways and up and down through the abyss they are confronted with mobs of different dream creatures, which drop keys and health and mana and what have you.\n\nMy personal inclination is to to say the mechanics are horribly clunky. The character moves very slowly and feels unresponsive. Constructing actual combos and meaingfully positioning yourself feels cumbersome. Now, people have said elsewhere that this is essentially the combat mode from Smash Bros, which I can see, and I am terrible at and do not enjoy. It is possible that this game is very fulfilling for someone who takes to this style of gameplay, but I do not. So overall my verdict on the gameplay is that it is horribly frustrating and ungratifying. My attempts to acclimate myself to the play style were so heavily thwarted in my short attempts at the game that I can't bring myself to go any further, even given how inviting the world is. Which is a shame.\n\nSo. A beautiful, intruiging game world. Massively clunky and frustrating fighting game mechanics pitting you against hyper responsive AI - though this hinges on my sucking at this game. A platformer utilizing unresponsive and clunky movement. This to me constitutes Abyss Odyssey.\n\nNot necessarily bad. For someone who can make this game work, which I'm sure they're out there, it might even be a great game. But I am not that person.  I'll be surprised if I can force myself into a few more hours of gameplay on it.\n\nIf you can pick it up for cheap, give it a shot! Chances are you might like it. If you dig Smash Bros style combat, you might dig this too.","November 11, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And this one is no exception.  It's an action platformer that supports online co-op. The art style, the music, the setting, it's all gorgeous, even if the story might feel too simple. I noticed some people complaining the controls were clunky, I think that doesn't do this game justice at all. The controls do feel heavy, but it sounds to me clear as day that it was a design decision. They didn't want to make another generic action game, they want you to think before attacking. Also, there are some really neat mechanics that help the game to stand out even more among other similar titles. My favorite one being releasing a charged attack that lets you "capture" an enemy and use him as a playable character in the current run. You're probably gonna chance characters a lot when running out of life in the lower levels (forgot to mention this game is all about venturing deep inside a dungeon to reach and kill an old man). This game is its own thing, just like all other ACE Team games. I highly recommend giving it a chance.","November 18, 2015","true","7.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/postmanmanman/recommended/255070/","postmanmanman","postmanmanman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/postmanmanman/","575 products in account","This is an impression based on one and a half playthroughs of the game. As you can see I only have maybe and hour and a half of playtime so you'll have to take what I say with a grain of salt. If my opinions change in the future, I'll be sure to update this review.\n\nAbyss Odyssey is basically a randomly-generated platformer/brawler set in 19th century Chile. The idea is that a warlock has created a large, shifting labyrinth, and as one of three characters (the second two of which must be unlocked) it's your goal to descend the labyrinth and kill the warlock at the bottom to destroy the titular abyss.\n\nSo, let's start with the good: the game's presentation is by and large pretty wonderful. Beautiful character portraits accompany the sparse dialogue and stage backgrounds drip with color and personality. Enemies and allies share the same, saturated visual style as the backgrounds, and there are some imaginative designs among the rogue's gallery of ghostly soldiers, spiders, bulls, ent-like creatures, and so on. However, though they look good standing still, movement and attacks animate with stiff rigor, creating an effect that's somewhat unpleasant, marring the otherwise remarkable visuals. The music is mostly forgettable. There's a strange mix of atmospheric ambience and jarring, rougly-Genesis-era midi-esque themes that pop up almost randomly; some stages are silent while others are accompanied by energetic themes with little explanation. It's weird and a little rough.\n\nNow, the not-quite-as-good: the highly touted fighting system that supports the whole experience. The bottom line is that... it's not particularly deep or well-integrated. ACE have clearly taken inspiration from Smash Bros., featuring a system based around regular attacks (and directional variants, e.g. neutral air, up air, down air, and side air) and directional specials, but heavy input lag and slow, chunky animations make it feel like wading through molasses. Combos are heavily restricted by the fact that attacks and movements can only be cancelled with the use of 'cancel points,' a regenerating resource that allows you to cancel regular attacks into special attacks, dodges, or jumps. You start the game with just one of these, and have at max three. The result of this stingy cancelling policy is that most of the time the only combat options you have available to you are basic two or three hit normal combos or the slow-to-start-up, very vulnerable specials.\n\nFurthermore, attack and character hitboxes are poorly defined. It's difficult to explain, but things that feel like they shouldn't connect do and that the should connect don't. Many attacks have hitboxes that last for what seems like ages, resulting in attacks that can't be dodged through and which come out too quickly to be jumped over by your sluggish double jump. The developers seem to have tried to avert this issue by giving you a large amount of health and a reasonable supply of healing potions, but being able to tank a lot of damage isn't satisfying in the way that being able to dodge a lot of damage is.\n\nThe need for large health pools is further highlighted by the ability to 'capture' enemies and play as them. All enemies work on the same basic tenets as player characters, in that they have a small pool of normal attacks and three directional special attacks. Captured enemies have their own pool of health, essentially serving as extra lives for your main character. While it's a neat idea, and it certainly highlights the complex enemy design, a large chunk of the enemies are simply trash to play as compared to the main characters. Capturing the regular ghostly soldiers that populate most floors of the dungeon reveals that, surprise, playing them feels like playing a weak grunt in a beat-em-up, because that's exactly what you're doing.\n\nOf course, that just makes it more necessary to capture the few enemies that are somewhat useful, but the capture ability, like all other movements and attacks, is clunky and difficult to rely on. Even after capturing a decent enemy, it's hard to shake the feeling that they're anything more than a meatshield for your main character.\n\nAttack diversity is poor and combo potential is fairly limited. The combo videos shown by Atlus prior to release seem to promise at least some degree of complexity, but combos like those shown would only be possible under very specific conditions. Most of the time you'll be up against three or four enemies in small, cramped environments littered with evironmental hazards that render movement and combo potential very difficult. In these situations, the most effective strategy usually ends up being mashing your basic normal chains until everything is dead, since the aformentioned cancel points are never plentiful enough to afford more interesting tactics.\n\nHaving said all this, I don't feel like the game is bad. It's hugely clunky and clashing gameplay elements discourage interesting play, but the mostly-wonderful presentation at least makes it an interesting trip. I'm also willing to believe that perhaps the combat system will become more interesting with continued use, given that many other beat-em-ups, like Guardian Heroes or Code of Princess, took some time to grow on me. Based on these middling first impressions though, I'm inclined to say it's only worth it if you're very curious about a couple of the novel ideas. Otherwise, I'd be much quicker to recommend Double Dragon Neon (which is also slow, but is very technical and rewarding), or Fairy Bloom Freesia (which also adopts a Smash-Bros-esque fighting system, but is much faster and smoother to play).","July 15, 2014","false","2.8"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","1"

The fan base will kiss up to the developers and the both will completely disregard anything negative said about this game.\n\nThe A.I. (NPCs) all will input read. This means that if you press Dodge, the A.I. will know what action you pressed immediately and react to the best possible outcome. This is all based on how far you are into the game however, as the farther down you go into the game the more reactive the A.I. will become. Sometimes to the point where you can't even land an attack because it will always be blocked or perfect blocked.\n\nNext, the game has the audicity to sent multiple enemies at you per fight, all of which have no collision (IE. They can stand in you and inside their allies). All of which input read. Then, the enemies also can not friendly-fire themselves, meaning they can all form a wall and corner you and continusely attack and combo you. They will not interrupt each other, and they are near infallible. Sometimes you get knocked into antoher enemy which will immediately grab you, then thrown into another. They are so pin-point and exact that is just becomes blatantly obvious how broken the A.I. is.\n\nWant to bring a friend? Well, that's going to be make things harder as unless you enable friendly-fire (They say the game is balanced around it) you won't be allowed to post to the leaderboards. You can friendly-fire and interrupt each other, but the enemies on the other hand can not. You also share drops, meaning a partner can take everything leaving you with nothing.\n\nThe coding in this game is also very, very bad. Bad network coding leads to a lot of lag even between people that are within the same time-zone and country, leading to some really annoying mishaps. Such as teleporting, falling through objects, and desynchronization. It's just overall poorly done.\n\nI highly recommend not buy this game. It's fun for a while, but the clear problems and lack of interest of changing it because the fan-base kisses up to the developers just leads to countless frustration.","November 10, 2015","false","20.2"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

(plus there are a bunch of enemies you can turn into -if you find or buy the items that let you do so.)\n\nThe problem is the execution in the online-play. There are latency BUGS, oh sweet pete, the bugs. There's the 'stuck-in-falling-animation'glitch (which comes with a free 'mid-air-platforms-are-now-invisible' bug), the 'not-pulling-myself-up-onto-that-ledge-when-I'm-right-there' bug, and on rare occasion, the 'keep-spawning-1-or-2-platforms-ABOVE-where-you-just-dropped' thing.\n\nIt's a shame because I was really enjoying this game -on Co-op, at least- but unfortunately the connection seems to be the most problematic.* (the 1st & 3rd bugs mentioned are latency-related.) I can understand latency issues (aka. 'lag') but I've never had bugs this game-breaking in any other games I've played before, latency-related or not.\n\nThe ledge-detection/ Platforming is honestly the most annoying part, though, as it seems to be inconsistent, especially depending on which character you have at the time (and there are a lot).\n\nIn the end, this game is definitely worth it on sale for $3 or less. It's unique characters & unique ability to (sometimes) be able to transform into another bizarro character just makes this game an appealing co-op game.\n...but just know what you're getting yourself into.\n\n\n----------------------------\n*full disclosure: I was playing on high-speed Wi-Fi, and the game likely uses Peer2Peer servers. I only had the glitches when I joined my friend's game.

I've played plenty of other indie games that didn't have dedicated servers, but none of the bugs were this annoying.)\n\nAs of writing, my specs: GTX 760, 8 GB RAM, 3.3 GHtz AMD FX6100.","December 14, 2015","false","4.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It plays a lot like Rogue Legacy, though far more forgiving, and the controls are actually more akin to the Smash Bros. franchise. It's the type of side scrolling rogue like that will demand strategy rather than brute force, but within minutes you will be blocking, triangle jumping, and back-air-attacking your way to victory! Worth noting that the sound track and visuals are top notch as well.

The movement, combat moves, the dodge rolls and shielding (even reflecting projectiles with perfect shield timing).  The game does very little to innovate in this regard, and if anything falls short of the slick feather touch needed to perform some of the most delicate maneuvers in previous Smash Brothers titles.  Characters and their movements comes across as bulky and unwieldy at times.\n\nFor me, an experienced Smash Brothers player, The whole experience is reminiscent of Adventure mode from Brawl thus far, although it adds a deal more options, customization, and items of an action RPG type.  However, the style is basically a very monolithic set of platforms and randomly spawning AI enemies.  Once you die, you are replaced by weaker character who is supposed to find a shrine to revive you, although thus far I have found no way to locate these other than by pure memory or chance.\n\nThe story is very poor so far, almost nonexistent.  Brawl Adventure mode accomplished a better story with its universal zero dialogue, than this game does with it's castlevania/fire emblem type conversations.\n\nThe best thing the game has going for it is the art style, which is an obvious tribute to Art Nouveau posters from the 1890s.  It is also good for all the reasons super smash brothers is good, but it in no way exceeds SSB in any way except the customization and items your characters has access to.\n\nGranted, I've only put in 2 hours, so I will update this if it changes after more play.","December 10, 2014","true","1.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But that is really the only thing it has going for it to be quiet honest.\n\nThe fighting is complete garbage. There's no real combos because your moves hit them away from you. To actually get combos you have to juggle the poor enemy against a wall or use your super. All the reviews that are comparing it to smash bros are somewhat correct but mostly assanine and not really helpful. Lke in smash bros, if you hold up and press attack, you will do an attack that is known as an up tilt, and this applies to all the directions, like in smash bros. The same rule follows aerials but they don't really lead to combos that often either. That is literally the only thing this game has in common with smash bros. So do not think you will be getting a cool game where you can combo people. There's a super move you get to use when your mana becomes completely full that can get you a pretty decent combo relative to the rest of the game though. By that I mean around 6 hits, which doesn't even kill an enemy. Useful.\n\nEdit: There's fast falling like in smash bros as well. There's also grabbing and rolling out of shielding, but that's kind of standard for these types of games.\n\nYou get three specials as well, and they are pretty easy to spam and honestly make quick work of the enemies usually. There's no real reason to use the regular attacks after you get them unlocked. Hell the first girl gets a fireball which is mediocre but then she gets a counter, which you can just stand still and spam then you get a pokey attack that seems to put the enemy in enough hitstun to follow up with another pokey attack.\n\nThere's random items throughout the map, which is randomly generated every time you die and go down there. There's weapons which can range from being incompatable with your character to being able to catch them on fire or freeze them. There's other passive armor type things and potions, antidotes and mana things you can pick up. Not much to say about that. Then there's these other items that you can activate that will let you completely transform into one of the enemy units. I have no clue if these are helpful in any parts but so far I find my character to be more comfortable to use.\n\nNow, you're probably wondering why I bothered typing out most of that? It's because the tutorial does absolutely nothing to help you other than your movements and give you your first special ability. That's it.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game at $15.

The controls are fine with a controller (why fight controllers on PC for games it makes sense? Honestly...) But there is a hitch with the mechanics of the game, which some perceive as unresponsive controls.\n\nThe mechanics are slow, plodding and clumsy. This isn't a 2D Devil May Cry game and it's not even a Shinobi or Ninja Gaiden game. It's even more slow. Slow to the point that it should be tactical but it isn't even that. Enemies remain unresponsive for most of the battles. So, your inclination is to just spam attack them and if you do they'll invariably hit you with their own clumsy attack which staggers you and slows everything down immensely. Because there's no obvious skillset or pattern to enemies this can make the game rather random and frustrating.\n\nI can see the appeal to such mechanics if you have the patience for them but I just don't think it's very fun in the end just like hacking and slashing can be very boring. Beautiful art design and music is wasted on a clumsy combat system that never really justifies itself.\n\nIt's a shame but there is a chance you'll like it.","November 5, 2015","false","1.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This causes MASSIVE problems, with one player having to stop and wait for the other player to manage to out-♥♥♥♥ the bad controls on top of having a gimped platforming character. Who's idea was this? This ruined the experience so much that I'm going to just refund the game and get Castle Crashers or something. At least that game works properly.\n\nFun game by yourself probably. Heavy emphasis on probably.","October 24, 2015","false","0.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

If you are a casual player you probably won't like it, this game takes some skills and practice to get through (which I didn't manage to at this point).\n\nStill, when you do get better and manage to easilly dismiss enemies which gave you trouble earlier, it's extremely rewarding. The feeling is akin to getting passed difficult sections in the Dark/Demon Souls games.\n\nThe gameplay is basically 2D fighting with some elements of platforming. At first, you might feel that the fight is pretty simple but you soon realize that it's way deeper than it looks.\nThe animations are clear for the most part and support well the fight. The characters feel responsive and are fun to play with.\n\nI urge you to do the tutorial or at least read the guide in the community section to help you get a head start. I didn't until after an or so of playing and I felt It would have helped me a lot.\n\nFinally, the art & music are magnificient.\n\nWhat I didn't try yet is the multiplayer, I've been player alone and cannot really comment on the MP part of the game as of yet.\n\nOverall, I think it's a pretty solid buy if you want a challenge and you like that type of game.","July 15, 2014","true","4.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Do you enjoy fighting games such as SF, MK, KOF, or MvC? Then look no further than Abyss Odyssey, I recently picked up this game, installed and lost myself in it for the next 3 hours.\n\nIt's similar in goal to Castlevania(not LoS, more like HoD), plays like a fighting game(dash attacks, dodging, special moves, juggles, etc.), and kicks the crap out of you like Dark Souls. You can play as one of the three characters(I only have two of the three so I can make no comments on the third character), Katrien, the fencer style character, the Ghost Monk, the big sword waving, fireball-tossing, robed badass, and a third character who appears to use a spear/polearm.\n\nYour main goal is to work your way down to the Warlock and defeat him, picking up power ups, weapons, and levels along the way. You can pick up special summons which can be activated by pressing down on the d-pad(Also, definitely should play this with some type of controller), which will turn you into a monster, whether it be a skeleton soldier, a sea witch, or a legless bird masked weirdo. This summon allows you to have essentially two characters, but if you die as your main character(Katrien, Ghost Monk, other lady) you lose the summon and become a soldier. If you die as your summon you become your main character. As the soldier you are slower, a bit weaker, and don't have access to the same amount of mobility or damage as your main character. However, if you make it to an altar or defeat one of the mini-bosses as the soldier you can revive as your main character(missing most of your HP).\n\nOverall, I would definitelly recommend picking up this game if you're looking for a challenging and fun beat 'em up rogue-like. Definitely worth it to buy on sale.","June 15, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I like very much the three main playable characters (and their transformations, as you can impersonate most of the monsters from the game once you beat them and meet  a few conditions), especially the two female fighting types. The writing is quite good (though rather sparse, in this type of game). The music is good too. The atmosphere is great : magical/Gothic/eerie... I like it.\n\nThe levels layout is random and the level design is semi-random, but once you went through it a few times it becomes rather repetitive and doesn't surprise you much any more.\n\nThe controls are adequate for fighting, and for exploring (climbing/jumping/crouching/etc...)\n\nThe first few time you play with a given character, the game is rather difficult past the first few levels. Then, you level up, gain new abilities, get a tougher character, and things get progressively easier.\n\nI suspect it will become rather repetitive after a few dozen runs. But for now, I've fun. I recommend this game: beautiful, a bit challenging but not too much, pretty characters, tons of enemies...

Became very UGH!\n\nOk so it feels like a pretty sweet side-scrolling RPG. You jump around, you stab things, and it feels like it should except for the fact the levels all look the same when you're in the same theme.\n\nSo my first big gripe is the loss of items. You farm up enough for that sweet sword! Great! Just don't ever die because you lose it for good and have to buy a new one. I assume this becomes less of an issue as you level up but it's incredibly annoying to find a couple of good items and a new weapon and POOF. You lose. That's the first.\n\nThe second and worst part of this game is the multiplayer option. The game feels ok when you're alone but woe to those who have a friend or anyone else join in. The camera suddenly zooms out and shoots back and forth between close up and far away depending on how far you two are because the game insists both of you are on the screen at the same time. This means you both better go down the same branches and paths or else one of you will be mostly out of the camera and it doesn't really seem to have a preference.\n\nEven worse in the multiplayer is TEAM HITTING! You're using swords in a small area fighting swathes of enemies. Yes if your sword hits them or they hit you, somebody is going flying or getting stunned. I played with one guy who had a sword with a freezing attribute. He accidentally hit me, froze me in mid air, and then I got pummeled by an enemy. Why the heck would you make a game about meelee fighting hit your teammate?! You don't hit the NPC soldiers that come to assist you so why couldn't you make it so we couldn't hit each other?! It begs for trolls or at the very least your friends stand back and don't do anything while you try to take on the enemies you cornered.\n\nSo yeah. I played this for a little while to see if I could enjoy it. I was digging it for a bit until I lost my items and somebody joined my game to demonstrate the absolutely inane system they had set up for playing with others.\n\n","November 24, 2015","false","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The controls are clunky and unresponsive, and you have a very limited selection of moves. That alone would be reason to avoid this game. To make matters worse, however, all the enemies you face have uncanny response time to your input, and you can do nothing but watch helplessly as they outmaneuver and counter your incredibly limited moveset constantly. Each level you enter has a randomized difficulty, but even at the easiest difficulty, enemies have far too much health. I want to stress this game is not "dark souls hard", where it's difficult but still feasible with the potential to be satisfying.

However, given it is an action-platformer, I cannot overlook the fact that the combat system in it's current form is rather awkward for the player; it gives a feeling of helplessness as your character madly swings away, gets parried then juggled for half of your health bar by a single enemy.\n\nWhile input delay is always in games to some extent, the contrast between your character's actions and those of the AI controlled enemies is vast and makes the game artificially more difficult. The main complaint I would have regarding this is the blocking. If you could block as quickly as the enemies are capable of, the whole dynamic would change. However, there are many animation frames that your character is simply locked into, leaving them open to attack by enemies who take ruthless advantage. To some extent, this can be mitigated by investing stat points as you level into the animation cancel skill, which allows you to chain attacks; this is where the game became the most satisfying for me as I finally felt like I was playing a more normal fighting game.\n\nI would really like to recommend this game to others, however the visual and aural setting is not quite enough to overcome the drawbacks of the combat system for me. I would point out the caveat that, yes, it becomes more interesting as you unlock more skills, but even then it tends to devolve into spamming the same skill chain and taking advantage of weaknesses in the AI's otherwise incredibly timed blocks.","November 29, 2014","false","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay is weird first, the combos will be hard to make untill the player gets used to the fight sistem, but its well made and realy enjoyable wen you learn some tricks. The multiplayer is realy good too, you can make it harder with friendly fire ON and activating the nightmare dificculty to add more chalange ( adds all boss / mini-boss a little help with +1 mini-boss and monsters will be more agressive, nothing related with + HP or +DMG to them, wich is a realy good, just more agression and +1 mini-boss on bosses/mini-bosses ). The music is too realy enjoyable and fresh, some times the game wont play it, but when it does its amazing and fits realy well into the game. The acting voices are too realy amazing, personaly i think the Monk voice is the best.\n\nThe game inst realy long, untill the player get used to the game, it will be easy to finish it, at least on normal mode. But its not a ''finish the game and its done'' tipe, wen you finish it, you have a new task, the task of capturing all the souls of the monsters you fight, to unlock them to use on PVP (local only untill now 22/07/14) and on training mode, and not just regular monsters, all mini-boss and the last boss itself can be captured, but you need some player LVLs to take them (some 25 , some 45, some 60), all monsters have theyr on move-set and spechials to be discovered and its realy fun to descover new combos with them. Also, all souls captured can be found at the church stage, being sold there, so you can always get them to play withaut needing to capture it again.\n\nAnd, wen the community kills the final boss, it will add to a count, shown at the beggining of the game as the ''broken mask'' on the book, and when the community has killed the boss X times, new game content will be released, so you can say its a game that, with time, will keep growing even more.

If you start mashing and do the combat-mayhem in co-op you will most probably lose. They actually also included an option for disabled friendly-fire too now.\nYou can also capture ANY of your enemies (with time and levelling, not everything anytime) and play as them, which is actually a pretty fun concept and it works out nice. So if it doesn't seem so from the start you still have variety and replayability in this game and it only promises more.\nThank you Team Ace.\nA nice mix of a side-scroller action fighting rpg. Old-school-like gameplay revived with new ideas.\np.s. it still could use some work with some bugs, mostly regarding co-op and saving, but I'm in no doubt it will be fixed soon.","July 22, 2014","true","23.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I really love the concepts and with some games the artstyle and settings. But I tend to only play them for 30-60minutes before I get bored.\n\nAbyss Odyssey has been an exception for me. The 'Beat-Em Up' style combat is extremely engaging and you learn quickly that not all fights can be button bashed and require some timing. On top of that the different ranges of the special moves mixed with unique fighting styles of each playable character keeps you wanting to progress.\n\nArtstyle is a hard one to critique when it purely comes down to personal tastes. For me the fact it was a game made by ACE Team, I know I'd love their approach to creating a unique setting. Theres just an amazing blend of Anime/Mange, Greek & South American (especially with the Chilean setting) styles. Combined that with a soundtrack that feels almost fitting in a Studio Ghibli film and you've got a truely memorable universe.\n\nThe mechanic in which your character can capture a soul of an NPC allowing you to not only have a second health pool, but to bring the unique special attacks of each one (each NPS has several standard fighting moves that vary with each enemy type and 3+ unique special attacks which vary on the type or rank of the NPC). Also the transformation into the soul is quick, so for example - you can play as the undead who can projectile vomit a stream of poison (with a knock back) then switch to your main character for some longer ranger hits.\n\nMy only real critique of this game is its length. It is a short game and runs can take about 30 minutes and don't have as much of a unique run expierence as say Binding of Isaac. But each time your character levels up becoming stronger. Weapons and items don't carry over which means which does mix it up each time, as well as serval unqiue 'special rooms' and mini-bosses.\n\nTheres definately room to expand the game which I hope ACE Team utilise (and not restricted by its multi-platform release) but for the content and the quality of the game, it is most definately worth the price as it stands.\n\n*controller recommended*","July 26, 2014","true","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The combat system, at least on normal mode, probably isn't as deep or challenging as it likes to pretend, but is still entertaining enough (the controls, though, can be a little spongey, but not enough to spoil the experience).

The Abyss is split into short dungeon level, pretty much all of which are a straight line left or right, go down a bit, then travel left and right again, rinse and repeat. Each level will feature some minor outcrops of paths to take but rather than giving you multiple paths to the bottom they just serve as quick dead ends that usually have a chest or a weapon. Sometimes there'll be a wall or obstacle or can smash with the right weapon, but rather than being rewarded handsomely for finding these secret areas, you'll just, again, find a chest or a weapon. Sometimes you’ll find the shopkeeper, who isn't in the least bit thankful for you rescuing him from his imprisonment.\n\nThe game is also extremely light on the "loot" aspect of dungeon crawlers, in fact most weapons you find are considerably worse than the stuff the guy at the beginning sells, and many times worse than the starting equipment. They also don't scale with your depth in the abyss, so you can find the best equipment you're going to find on the first floor of the dungeon. You can equip a few trinkets, each have effects like increased weapon damage or extra health, but you do so little damage per weapon strike that unless you find something that doubles your current attack it's incredibly difficult to notice any increases. You'll find money littering the stages which you can use to purchase stuff from the shopkeeper who has no problems getting around the abyss or at the start, before you enter the abyss, from the soldiers that just decided to set up shop rather than help out.\n\nAs such how good you are at the beat 'em up part is of far more importance. Sadly while the game does give you a brief tutorial during the prologue, it doesn't really prepare you for what's ahead. Combat is essentially a single button + one of four directions to perform a particular attack, characters also have skills, which are a second button + one of three directions, however which skill is performed can be set by the player at a shrine. At first glance combat can appear sluggish in that the delay between performing moves is quite noticeable, however you can "combo" moves to an extent to remove this delay. The combat basically comes down to crowd control, as if the enemies overwhelm you, that's basically it, they can juggle you can keep you from performing a single action all night long. Overall, controls are tight, but at the same time a bit too rigid, like the inability to change direction in mid-air, so if you press jump a bit too quickly and haven't turned around prior to the jump, you can find yourself jumping backwards into a wall you're trying to scale. This happens all too often for my liking.\n\nYou can unlock two further characters; Ghost Monk who just seems to unlock once you've played a bit and is much slower but hits far heavier, and Pincoya who you unlock by giving money to a fountain on a "gold stage", who is faster and whose attacks generally have a wider area of effect. You can also get the souls of your enemies, which allows you to switch to whichever soul you currently have, giving you the chance to play as almost (I believe there's a couple you can't) any enemy character. This touch adds a lot of strategy as this soul has its own health meter in addition to its own attacks, so finding the most appropriate soul for your play style or switching between that and your character at an opportune time can help a lot in battles.\n\nWhere the game shines is in its aesthetics, the game looks amazing and while it suffers from generic dungeon settings (fire/ice/forest with no real logic connecting them), each environment has some traps and obstacles that are unique to them.\n\nHowever the story feels just tacked on, you're given the bare bones of the premise as justification for you to continue your descent into the Abyss. Sometimes enemies will drop "journal pages", which are the warlock's secret diary that he tore up and distribute amongst his minions... for some reason. This journal is where you find out pretty much all of the story and backstory... If you get lucky enough for the game to drop it, I'm still missing a single page about 10 hours after picking up my last entry...\n\nIt isn't exactly difficult to get to the end of the abyss, but it'll most likely take a few attempts to beat the warlock since his attacks are hard hitting and don't require him to be near you (he can also spam moves like crazy). They included some kind of community driven goal in that the emblem on the front of the book as the game loads will gradually break, revealing a new emblem once the old one is completely destroyed. This indicates that the dungeon enemies are different; however whether this means they're outright stronger it was hard to tell. The levels also seemed slightly longer, however it doesn't seem possible to go back to the "original" version of the game to compare.\n\nThe game *is* fun, which I guess is the most important factor, but it comes with the caveat that it relies more on the enjoyment of beat 'em ups than dungeon crawling. Also that each subsequent time through the dungeon becomes less fun since there really is nothing to explore. The game may change each time the emblem shatters, but if you're not actively checking the game for that, you may never know that it's updated, nor really care.","September 15, 2014","true","16.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While I have barely scratched the surface of Abyss Odyssey, it is easy to see within the first few minutes that this is one of the really good ones.  If you're looking for a more tactical title, this isn't Mark of the Ninja.  What it is, however, is a beautifullly stylized, side-scrolling platformer/beat-em-up.  I have only a few complaints.  First and foremost, in order to do what the game tells you to do, for instance, block, you have to go back to the default bindings menu.  This is a minor quibble as, once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature.  Second, the levelling up and upgrades are inexplicably unexplained.  You're simply told to assign skill point to a picture.  I've not played a lot, so I'm still scratching my head as to what the skill points actually do or how to use the skills axquired since none of this is explained at all, even though you get your first upgrade within five minutes of starting (no tutorial exists either).  Lastly, the game was clearly designed to be played with a controller to the point where using the keyboard feels unnaturally clunky.  No biggie there if you have a controller, but I don't, and I wish games designed to be played with a controller would advertise that fact through strong developer suggestions.  As I now have quite a few games designed in this fashion, acquiring said controller is an inevitability and I will update this review if anything changes after that.  Otherwise, this is a solid thumbs up with a few minor issues, easily worth the <$10 I spent during the sale.","December 27, 2014","true","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While I like the game's aestetics its gamepley is rather boring. Maybe it would change a bit if I would play a bit longer and if maybe eventually level designs and encounters would become more interesting, but it isn't only problem. Moving in this game is really awkward. It isn't as fluent as for example in similarly named Abe's Odyssey. In fact I had more problems with properly executing double jump and reaching certain areas then with fighting enemies. To make things worse the game is bugged. I ended my adventure with this game when I was unable to close tips pop up bacause the game wasn't responding to "B" key. Exactly this same happened to my friend on his PC. The fact that we both found this bug after few minutes of experiencing this game, as well as fact that such basic bug wasn't corrected after about a year that passed since release of the game, doesn't looks promising.","September 4, 2015","false","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goosederr/recommended/255070/","goosederr","goose","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goosederr/","63 products in account","I badly want to play this game to completion but cannot get myself to do it for a few reasons:\n\nOne: It's ♥♥♥♥ing difficult on just the normal difficulty... I cannot imagine the impossibility of completing it on the nightmare difficulty without dedicating hours to becoming skilled with the controls and the game mechanics; and I usually will just hop right into a game on one of the harder difficulties in seek of a challenge - I like challenge. What I don't like is seen in reason numero...\n\nTwo: THE GAME IS NOT COMPLETE. I enjoy the artistry, the music and the overall idea but besides the difficulty in itself the game has some faults that make it even harder. Such as the fact that gold might as well be useless since you cannot keep your weapons or inventory items after you die. This isn't all that bad though the fact alone will cause some apprehension while playing, especially since the controls are a bit difficult to get used to and in a lot of instances, players will find themselves faced against a multitude of highly-coordinated enemies who will need to be struck many-a-time before they die. This is enough of a challenge alone but if you're killed, you lose all of your items and you need to start from the beginning unless you buy a checkpoint coin...which inevitably ♥♥♥♥s you over as you start in the middle of the map with your default weapons.\n\nThree: Once your main character dies, you're given an alternative soldier character with much less ability to defend himself than your main. This is fine as it encourages a player to revive their main. A HUGE issue is that the soldier cannot always reach the resurrection shrine in order to do so since he can only jump like two feet in the air and in a lot of cases cannot even get around the map himself which, in turn, forces a player to just let him die so that they can respawn with their main... with, do I dare say it again...the default weapons.\n\n\nOverall I like the concept of the game but I think, like how any great story needs a proofread, this game should've been looked over a few times for any inconsistencies before it was released. I'm thankful I only bought it for a dollar.","January 12","false","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

E.g. if I perform a move, say left block, and then don't use it for 10-20 seconds, the next time I try to use it, the game freezes and then shows the animation at a fast pace.

This is horrible, it is simply inexcusable in any action game that u can’t move and attack at the same time.\n\nNext is the ranged combat, the inability to aim the ranged skills in any direction is absurd when u add in the fact u give us flying enemies...\n\nThe art is nice, the dialogue is great and the sound is phenomenal.

And paying only $9.99 didn't make it a bad deal.  The problem really arises with the controls and how the characters fight, as they are clunky and rather slow.  And many times I found myself at the end of an animation getting hit.  While I imagine this is what the designers were going for, it's not something I enjoy dealing with.\n\nWhen you die, you take over as a human who for the most part is weaker than your main character.  The novelty of this wore off pretty quick.  So in a way, this game is very much a rogue-like.  I admit I wasn't expecting this, and usually playing a rogue-like is pretty enjoyable but in this game it took away enjoyment from the experience.\n\nAnd why is it that they didn't give you the ability to customize the buttons on the controller???\n\nOverall it isn't a bad game and will be hit among those who like rogue-likes.  But in my overall opinion, I wouldn't recommend this game to people unless you were getting it really cheap in a bundle or you love rogue-likes and super smash brothers controls.\n\nAnd it looks like they did give you the ability to change your key bindings on controllers and gamepads.

Well it does, until you actually get to play this game. The big part of great brawling mechanics is having tight and responsive controls, great animations and overall satisfying feel of combat. This game has only one thing going for it - good animations, everything else is quite lackluster, the controls feel unresponsive and way too sluggish. Probably they were going for a tactical feel of combat, where you have to time everything right and avoid button-mashing, but it really doesn't work out. When you face 1 or 2 enemies at the same time the combat is bearable at best, but anything above that is a cluster♥♥♥♥ and it gets really frustrating really fast.\nThat's already enough to NOT recommend it, because combat was clearly the main focus of this game, and they failed to deliver, but there are some more things that keep me from recommending it:\nShallow level tiles - levels look bland and very repetitive, the level design overall is poor as well\nDeath mechanic - when you die you get to play as a support character, which is even more clumsy and awkard to control and you're basically stuck with it until you die for real\nPlay long enough, you can overpower anything - I mentioned how the combat in this game is bad, well... It's doesn't actually matter, if you play long enough - you can just accumulate enough levels and gold to power through most of the levels, which makes it more of a grind\n3D on 2D planes looks bad - maybe it's just me, but i don't really like the look of 3D models on plain backgroundsNow there are some good things going for this game: interestying art style, theme, good character design, interesting enemies, enemy capture mechanic is fun to play with.\nSo, overall, the awkward feel of the combat is enough alone to not recommend it, I did not enjoy my time with this game.","November 14, 2015","false","5.1"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

Perhaps it's not the kind of game I thought it was, but the lack of checkpoints or saves, plus the fact that I loose all the the weapons, rings, etc when I die or in between play sessions is a deal breaker for me.  The special attacks do carry over though, if that's some consolation.  This is one of those games that is very short and you just try to play through in one sitting.\n\nI can overlook all this and blame myself for not reading more about it before buying.  But on top of this, the combat is very clunky.  I spend most of the game attacking in the wrong direction, just because it's so slow to turn the character around.

It reminds me of the Adventure mode from Smash Bros, but randomly generated every time. It's random in the sense that the map layout changes, and the level setup changes. You will encounter a lot of the same enemies throughout the game, but there is a decent amount of them to make it not feel too repetitive. You will also experience a specific level type multiple times in a playthrough (as in you will probably do an ice level a few times).\n\nThe combat is also in the style of Smash Bros, but has less moves. Since I'm a big Smash Bros fan, this actually made the controls feel a bit clunky because I would expect to do a certain move, but instead did nothing. It's not really a bad thing, just confusing at first. I feel like there could be more moves and combos though. It's not the best combat in the world, but it's completely fine after playing with it for a little while.\n\nOne of my biggest complaints is friendly fire. There is no option to turn this off, and it makes co-op very difficult. My friend killed me almost the same amount of times as the enemies, and it wasn't on purpose. Since you share a screen in a small area, it's too hard to fight a group of enemies with a friend and not hurt them as well. There needs to be an option to disable friendly fire.\n\nA lot of items are crazy expensive at the vendors, so you will have to save up your gold. You can also find items from chests, which has been the easier thing to do so far. I feel like saving up gold is a challenge, and it's very possible that it could go to waste if you buy an item and die early on. Health orbs from enemies barely give you HP, and I think they could use a bit of a boost.\n\nIf you are a fan of rogue-like games, you should get this game. It is easily worth the price. I hope they continue to update the game with more content and maybe more combat mechanics. You should grab a friend to play with too, even though they might end up killing you on accident.","July 15, 2014","true","7.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

The turning(left or right) of the character is pretty slow, which affect pretty much when you're in combat.\n2. When your main character died, you have to play as the soldier to continue fighting through the stage and trying to revive your main character at the altar. This is when the problem occurs, the movement and fighting animation of the soldier especially katrien's soldier is quite glitchy. The swinging of the sword sometimes or mostly doesn't damaged the enemies, especially when you're overlapping with your enemy (even a little of overlapping).\n\nThese are the problems that frustrated me so much when playing this game, but if you don't care about these problems, then go ahead and buy it :).

Athough there are no command inputs, like quarter circles on the joystick, the movement feels a lot like Super Street Fighter.  The combat system is not build around flashy air combos and button smashing; instead it focuses on simple strikes, a few special moves and tight hit boxes where timing is everything.\n\nAlong with this familiar focus on timing, the developers also were wise enough to borrow some of the more familiar ways players take advantage of timing in Street Fighter.  Knockdowns, cancels, blocking, keep-away techniques like uppercuts and projectiles (think Ryu/Ken), wall juggling, as well as super moves that stop the animation for a moment were all welcomed discoveries for me.  Fighting games are of a special genre where dexterity and muscle memory actually matter, and when one is disguised as a rogue like adventure game or platformer like Abyss Odyssey might be, it can easily be unfairly compared to the wrong games.\n\nAs a fighting game, this gets a solid A-.  It's not fantastic, but it is rather good.  The turn-around animation is a bit slow and too long horizontally for some characters which make it frustrating to face the enemy in narrow places.  There also seems to be a lot of ways to break your block, which makes blocking less useful than it should be.  The AI is very smart and ramps up in difficulty nicely - although I do wish I could change the general game difficulty through the UI.  Nitpicks aside, this is the best $15 I've spent in a while - and I haven't even tried the multiplayer yet.  It’s beautiful, the rouge/dungeon crawling is light and fun, and it even has community based goals that will unlock more content.\n\nIf you like fighting games, this one is solid and unique enough not to pass up.  If you are not a fan of the genre however, the learning curve might be a bit too steep, but it also might be one of the more fun fighting games to learn on given it has so much more content  to enjoy.","July 16, 2014","true","38.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Before you read further, let me sum it up with a I give it a 6/10... So not a standing ovation, but not terrible either. The 2D art used in the game is wonderful and the characters they create are interesting and varied in this world that had so much potential. I honestly enjoy the 3 playable characters and their assortment of foes especially the devil. However, the game needs serious work; it does not feel like a fleshed out game at all. The maps are relatively stale (usually about 3-4 backdrops) and somewhat small, the creatures you fight are not varied as well and while some are well designed and are great to play as, most are not. In fact, if you can capture the spirit of the bird with the spear just right click and kill most AI in the game without challenge. The bird as well as the skeleton with the sword and the uppercut special are OP and kind of the only useful enemy spirits. As for the actual characters, the main fencer woman is nice but clunky to control till you get her specials. The hooded monk is nice but I haven't played him out yet. The female water god is OP with her axe, but her jelly fish special is completely worthless (you'll find out and quickly trade it out for melee specials). The weapons you find for the characters are horribly mundane and not varied. Most of the time you will not find a better weapon for your character and the levels on the weapons go up to about 3 (when your character can exceed lvl 30+). The game also has kind of low replay value. If they add to this game, flesh out the world, spruce of the character textures and add more variety, this game will be great, but as it stands, its a nice shade of mediocre.","July 20, 2014","true","6.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Feels like a rogue-lite beat-em-up featuring fighting game elements. The flow of combat in this game takes some getting used to, and will almost definitely feel sluggish and unresponsive at first. However, I noticed that this feeling disappeared after spending around two hours in the game. The different playable characters all feel unique with different play styles. The game does come off as a little on the easy side, but the procedural generation of the dungeon combined with the ~37 different possible transformations/characters increase the replayability. To top it off, the developers have stated that additional content (enemies, transformations) will become available as players, globally, defeat the final boss. I utilize a controller for playing this game, and would definitely suggest one to any potential players.

In short - it's fun and worth a buy. Though this game is not without problems. Mostly, you have to use analog to play, which should be fine for those transitioning from SSB.

The system is surprisingly deep for something that's pretty much relegated to two attack buttons.\n\nThe game is short, and at the moment it's fairly easy. Boss encounters can all be "cheesed" - making most of those fights devoid of skill of you so choose. Hopefully there's a difficulty patch to come later on which will add real difficulties not just "area" difficulties which you can't really directly control besides selecting other areas to visit. It also seems to me that some balancing may need to take place on the characters you pick up as items as some are clearly better than others, while the grappler character (the one who spits poison) is pretty garbage overall. He has slow pokes and as such they're low priority since they have such long recovery. Most of his special moves are inefficient as well. There's two who I've seen who are stand out, as in far far superior to the rest that I've tried.\n\nIt took me about 4 hours to beat the game, mostly because I was trying to unlock the final character. In the end I beat it with the default character but made it to the boss once with the cloaked spirit sword guy.\n\nOverall, once you get the hang of some of the advanced types of attacks and combos, the game becomes more fun than it already is, however its length is somewhat of a dissapointment, seeing as there's not much of a reason to replay once you've unlocked all of the main characters. Completionists can unlock the supporting summon cast, but these seem to be fairly random, and many can be purchased with gold in game.\n\nI have yet to try Co-op but I've read that friendly fire is an issue for some. I'll leave that TBD though. The devs plan on adding in online for the versus mode which may come in a later patch, but for now Versus sounds like a great idea but is something I won't get to play.\n\nOverall - somewhat of an expensive game ($15) for the amount of game time you may be likely to sink into this, but if you're a diehard SSB fan, or fighting game and roguelike fan, you'd probably deem the purchase worthwhile.","July 15, 2014","true","10.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It looked great, the controls and everything about it was interesting. I wouldn't say "don't buy this game", but I after I bought it, I felt somewhat ripped off. This is because when I bought the game, I went straight to multiplayer to go practice as the character I played at in EVO. Turns out you have to play the single player to unlock EVERYTHING for the multiplayer; The main characters, side-characters, even movesets. The moveset is customizable and that's cool & all, but I had anticipated to just dowload and play with some friends to show them the game. I had hoped that I would have played the exact same multiplayer build I played before, but I have to now put hours into the singleplayer game just to get the roster and all of their moves for the multiplayer. I honestly don't want to do that if I already got a taste of a awesome multiplayer build back in EVO. I don't know if they changed that or not, but that's just my exprience with the game. Get it if you want, but you'll have to put in a lot of time to get an actual good taste of the competitiveness in the game.","September 20, 2014","false","2.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Not because it's bad per se but because it has so much potential to be great.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Fantastic Soundtrack. I only wish you didn't have to own the game to buy it first. I'd pay the price of the game for the soundtrack alone. I will look around to see if I can find it elsewhere, though.\n\n- Unique Artstyle. While I admit I'm not a big fan of the character or creature models art style, it is still different. So, I give it credit there for not looking like everything else out there.\n\n- Interesting story from the little bit I've seen. I'd like to see the rest but since I won't be finishing the game that's not going to happen.\n\n- Great presentation. The menus and interface are all very well designed and put together. Everything flows pretty well as it should in any dungeon crawler like this.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Art Style. This one is strictly opinion but even though the art style is different than most, it's still pretty ugly in terms of the characters and even the environments at times.\n\n- Combat: One thing that's extremely vital in a game like this is good fliud combat. It's just not here. Don't get me wrong. You can have a decent game with stiff controls but considering most of your characters aren't exactly "power" characters, you might expect them to be a little more limber and agile. The animations are nothing to boast about and considering this is a core game mechanic, it's a big hit to the games playability.\n\n- FRAME RATE: Considering my machine is powerful enough to run Bioshick Infinite, Arkham Asylum, Portal 2 and Crysis 2 flawlessly on MAX SETTINGS, I would have expected this game to run the same. The game seems to jump slightly at times and there seems to be slowdown occuring almost consistently. I don't know what's going on but it's almost like someone didn't optimize this game to run very well.\n\nThis could really be a masterpiece almost but it just falls short.\n\nI'd recommend Outland, Dust: An Elysian Tale or Valdis Story instead.","September 3, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

I can't believe I didnt buy this game earlier. It has a fantastic artstyle - unsurprising considering it's ACE team (Zeno Clash had such a cool art direction.)\nLove how the game plays, it's one of the cooler brawler / rogue light games i've seen. Many people claim that the combat is "off" or clumsy and well..\nAt first I agreed - and it's mostly due to the fact that you can't cancel out of attacks and if you start a basic attack you are rooted until the animation is up. (You can, however cancel normal attacks for special attacks)\nThis is less of a problem once you start to use your attacks more carefully and less spammy (as it often is at the start)\n\nThe game is rather short though, I havent beaten it but i'm very close, most people are able to beat this title in 4 hours or less, even 2. But it has, since it's a rogue light a lot of replay value. The characters are really cool too - I just wish it had more of a story than it has, since the voice acting is prettty much okay and the story is pretty interesting.\nAll in all I recommend it to any brawler/roguelight fans :)","September 6, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Lack of real teaching tools for a new player makes it difficult to get into without having to memorize the keyboard shortcuts from the beginning instead of gradual learning.\n\nMaybe me playing this game with a less than ideal computer was a mistake and somewhat lessens the truthfullness of my review, but no matter. I simply didn't find the game enjoyable.\nI understand the game is inherently angled to people who like challenge, who want to be thrust into something and learn to conquer it themselves. But the fact I had to keep breaking flow in order to work out what ♥♥♥♥ing button did what (by going to the control menu) just sorta pisses me off. A game of this nature relies on flow, and if I can't keep that flow going because I don't know how the play the game, you're maybe doing it not too great for some of us.\nAnd the sheer speed the enemies move (coupled with low framerate from aformentioned ♥♥♥♥ computer) made it impossible for the game to feel natural. Something about clicking being the method of attack threw me off as well. Hearing my mouse rapidly click clack away as I tried to hit a skeleton just wasn't doing it for me.\nThe graphics look reasonably nice though. Perhaps the game is more enjoyable with a controller and a good pc. Perhaps pigs fly. Perhaps the fact I played for 8 minutes cheapens the opinion of the review. I don't care, didn't enjoy, would rather go play Symphony of the Night on an emulator.","September 4, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Characters hardly jump when you want them too, their movements are sudden and make me feel like I'm leading a lead brick through a side-scrolling dungeon.\n\nWhile jumping, you have little if any control of how far and how high you jump, and especially where you land. When the characters do jump, they feel as if they're jumping with a ton of bricks on their back.\n\nThe keyboard commands are also confusing and use minimal customization. If you want one key to jump and go "up" at the same time, you can forget it. What does "UP" Even mean? It's a side-scroller for god sake. UP means JUMP.\n\nThe combat system is clumsy and uncoordinated. The concept of blocking and dodging are completely lost to the fact that they're completely useless unless you block for long periods and then spam the dodge key away from enemies, and the fact that you can't dodge around an enemy and end up facing their direction is extremely frustrating, even though I know it's intended use was for dodging backwards, but c'mon, give it a bit of thought to crativity. And no, I don't want to have to keep spamming the attack key to win. I want to have to think to be able to win, damnit.\n\nDo I reccomend this? No. I don't reccomend this at all.

This game.\n\nAbyss Odyssey is a 2-Dimensional dungeon crawler/rougelike. It looks good(Both in trailer and graphics) but is horrible to play. Just as a note i played with a keyboard not a controller.\n\nFirst lets talk about the UI. It is the thing that killed this game the most for me. It SUCKS. To figure out most buttons I had to go to the controls menu. The UI its just looks... bad. Its mostly just brown-ish yellow-ish paper. Which I get it is in the 1890's but.. still. It looks bad.\n\nGameplay its self is not only annoying but un-intuitive. You have (in the beggining) a grand total of 4 moves. 2 of which are DEFENSIVE. I get you 'build it up as you go along' but seriously? 2 fighting moves? SERIOUSLY? Another thing is you start of as a character that can only use one-handed weapons, and I personally came across 4 really cool looking weapons that I COULDN'T PICK UP.\n\nGraphics and sound is good. Not the best, but it doesn't put your eyes and ears in agony. Its actually quite nice.\n\nNow time to grade!\n\nUI: 3/10\nGameplay: 4.25/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nSound: 7.4/10\n\nOVERALL: 4.3/10 and therefor a Thumbs DOWN.","September 3, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Problem is, its not just the controls.\nThis game is very porrly made, it has a horrible AI which will outnumber and ♥♥♥♥ your bumhole, and very sloppy controls even for controller. On top of that not only when you die the first time you get a character with a completely different moveset and you lose everything if that character dies, exept for money. Every item you bought (which have insanely high prices for this kind of game) is lost if your second character dies. Its like this game WANTS a bad review.\n\nSo, lets post the - and + of this game.\n\n+ .) 1.) Multi-player (which is very much needed for casual players)\n2.) Interesting Lore.\n3.) PvP.\n4.) NPC allies (sometimes)\n\n- .)   1.) bad voice acting for most NPC's.\n2.) Lose every iten you bought after 2 deaths.\n3.) Terrible AI.\n4.) enemies usually out number you.\n5.) bad community (people that dont know the game's controls and people that attack you when you want to co-op)\n\n\nSo, all in all, i didn't get very far through the game so i can't tell you all the Negatives and Plus's\nBut, in my time playing these types of games, i've never seen such a poorly made game in my life.\n\nIf this game compelles you, go ahead buy it or try it out in the next three days as it is F2P till then But, do not be dissapointed when you see sloppy controls, terrible AI etc.","September 3, 2015","false","1.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

They are just too damn clunky.  Fighting is more frustrating than fun.\n\nThe one good thing about this rogue-LITE, are the graphics.  The game looks very differant than most 2D brawlers.  This still can't save the game from terrible gamepad control's.  I beat the game in about 3 hours.  For 15 bucks that doesn't seem like it's worth the money.  Well you say, go level the other 2 characters and you'll artificially inflate the game time.  Yes this is true.  But when the combat is so frustrating for some characters, such as the monk, then I just cant endure it.  I just want to rage every time I play the monk becasue his attacks are so slow and his specials require space.\n\nI must be terrible at the game because the biggest combo I can muster is 4 hits.    There are just too many monsters on screen and too much going on for me to think effectively.  The monsters give you plenty of time on the easy levels to think out a strategy.  But most of the time it's just button mashing your specials.  There is definately some skill involved.  So if you're bad at fighting games, then avoid Abyss Odyssey.\n\nAs a game by itself. It isn't bad.  It is just VERY short. I honestly wish I could refund but as I said it took me 3 hours to beat the first time.","July 27, 2015","false","7.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Beautiful characters looking totally  lame and impotent!  Let's start with basic combat ommisions, can't turn around in combat, attack are planted stiff on spot, can't interrupt attack, even with blocking. Can't interrupt hits received.\n\nThen I activate good old couch coop! Be advised : FRIENDLY FIRE IS FULL ON! So your only coop strategy is to take enemies in a sandwich. Both character are also visually identical so it's part of the puzzle. And the enemies fight beautifully, to our demise. In five minutes I've beend introduced to at least 5 - 6 different enemy types that I couldn't humanely decode. You'll face butt kicking traps with infinite health for tutorials, they even have to play a silhouette of the character mimicking the solution and even then I'll tell you, you have to dodge in the air. And watch out for the swinging axe's return XD hilarious!\n\nWas just the first minutes, I'll go back into it because I think it's a great learning experience. But after those first few fighting humiliations and confusing level design, we put down the controller just disgusted and wanting to do something better with our time.

It's from indie dev ACE but publisher ATLUS who brings Persona, Fire Emblem, and Shin Megami, so is it really indie? Indie seems tacked on meant to excuse the shoddy game.\n\nDESIGN:\nThe nobody policeman pop in if your main character dies and they're the most memorable imagery in the game. They don't even get names but their art is all that stands out. The character art is alright but it's filler image that goes in and out just as quick. It might be more interesting if the level design were better but everything is drab and blends in except the policemen. I feel like I was half asleep while playing the game because it was so hard to pick out any details. The treasure boxes, the platforms, even the characters meld together so it's difficult to know what's background and what's interactable.\n\nThe jumps are (intentionally?) leaden so while you have a double jump, it rarely does much good. Trying to platform onto some of the moving ledges makes me more frustrated than Guacamelee's time warp/wall jump BS, and yet the punishment is 200 off your health. Three or four misses take half your health while enemies drop little orbs that replenish only 50. The actual fighting is boring and basically button-mashing, except you have to use the sticks so it's just stick wobbling. If there's a strategy, it's not apparent.\n\nThere's something to be said for a game that doesn't hold your hand in today's world of hour long tutorials and mobile games, but Abyss Odyssey teaches you--slowly--how to attack, jump, run, and dodge. Each of these are simple button presses that have to be figured out prior to the game prompt. However, nothing else is explained. Are there elemental weaknesses? There are apparently counters. The nuances are left mysteries. I wouldn't be surprised if major mechanics went unnoticed for a month in this game.\n\nSometimes health bars pop up above the enemies, but only as flashes that show you enemies still have health. How much? It goes by too quickly to tell. If you poison an enemy, a green number appears and counts down. What's this for? Possibly a timer till the enemy is hurt again or until the poison is gone. It doesn't count down in a timely manner though. Each numeric drop takes anywhere from 0.2 seconds to 5.0 seconds.\n\nIt touts procedurally generated terrain as a plus, but it becomes forgettable because there's no human touch to it. It's a winding path of dead-ends and sudden fights where you're fenced in until....something happens. It's a mystery as to what. Sometimes one of the three enemies will die and the fences will drop and sometimes you have to kill all of them. Sometimes after a bit of fighting, the walls fall prematurely. It makes sure that none of the playthroughs are the same, and each delve into the depths takes only an hour if you don't die, but they're all such a blur of boring that it doesn't matter that they're different.\n\nThere are three characters, but the two I have play identically. They have different weapons and as Katrien, I often find Ghost Monk's weapons or Pincoya's, which can't be picked up even for gold. If I find Katrien's weapon, then it's worse generally. Same goes for while playing as Ghost Monk.\n\nCONTROLS:\nI tried my Xbox One controller to start as it's run every other game I've played. The controllers were sluggish and sometimes Katrien wouldn't attack or dodge or whatever. After 20 minutes of that torture, I tried my 360 controller and it worked better but still the X button wouldn't attack reliably. I had to go to the Right Stick to attack anything, which seems to be the intended button, but all the special attacks and jump buttons are mapped to the A, B, and Y so why would I need to switch from stick to button for combos? The Y specials aren't reliable either. To attack, you press up or forward or down and Y, but trying to get the correct one to trigger is about 33% reliable.  There are all these attacks mapped to too few keys and other buttons left unused. It's bearable, but not at all intuitive. Maybe the keyboard is easier to use.\n\n\nSTORY:\nI don't know. You're a dream of the warlock fighting the warlock and if you die, you're reborn with your money and level but not your weapon or items. Maybe it's a Chilean legend as most characters have hispanic names and some have hispanic accents. It often feels like a Japanese name where everyone is named Suzuka or Takashi and the story is just going by without significance or weight for Westerners. There's not much there anyway. Little bits of dialogue. The Warlock and Katrien apparently used to do it in their marital bed, but now she's trying to stop him. After beating it once with Katrien, you unlock a Ghost Monk who uses a different weapon. He's death or something. It doesn't make sense.","July 16, 2014","false","2.6"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

They are all square block mazes. And they're not even hard mazes (logically).

There is no telegraphing of enemy moves either.\nYou best option is to discover bad patterns in the enemy's AI such as dodging right into a low sword attack after you fire a projectile into them. Often you can face away and just do a crouching attack which just kinda rolls back and hits them.\nBasically the combat is not fun. It's too sluggish to control, and you resort to exploits which is not fun either.\n\nTo sum up, control is not fun (moving and attacking), exploration is not fun, there is no action, it's just not a deep or fun game.\n\nAlso, when you defeat a shopkeeper he does not drop the loot he was carrying.\nWhy is there an option to attack him when it's a waste of time?","May 21, 2015","false","1.7"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I'd like to post something along the lines of "in spite of these difficuties" but the gameplay is terrible.  They force you along you a main storyline to begin which is fine to learn your basics, but after floor 1 the kid gloves come off and you realize that they weren't making this for the players.  It changes quickly from an experience that you think might be reminicent of a castlevania to wondering why there are no hit boxes for your enemies or yourself.  My genuine complaint is about the mechanics.  It seems like the designers wanted a beautiful game that could do a lot, but got kind of bored half way through the process.  If they patch the hell out of it I'll be stoked, but as it stands it's not worth a couple bucks much less the $14.99 they're asking.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BertieWooster/recommended/255070/","BertieWooster","William Shakesman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BertieWooster/","1087 products in account","tl;dr: The combat is laudable but still unsatisfying. The feel is off and there's little room to demonstrate superior skill against the enemies because they are all playable characters and thus can do anything you can. The dungeon and story are charmless. Interesting game, worth a taste, not a classic.\n\nI dream of battling huge steroided up jerks. The huge guy lets out a roar before his swing, I dodge, counter attack, he flashes before I finish my combo, I dodge out of it just in time to avoid a fearsome counter-attack. Really, give me an attack button and a satisfying dodge roll and I am a happy camper in most games.\n\nActually, scratch that, turns out I need a bit more than just Attack and Dodge. Odyssey has both in spades and it is not quite enough for me.\n\nOdyssey is a side-scrolling brawler roguelike-ish game with a random dungeon and permadeath and all the usual fixin's as well as persistent XP growth and move collection and what-not, the usual sort of thing you expect of the recent indie action roguelike trend. The combat is somewhere south of Smash Bros and east of Bloodrayne Betrayal (Only not nearly as awful.) Your moveset is limited, attack+direction, special+direction, but there is some combo potential here, though a lot of the fighting feels a little stiff and wooden. Watching enemies get up is a Chilean passtime, it seems; you'll do a lot of that. You have a limited number of dodge cancels before they have to recharge (See Valdis Story only less cool.) and can become pretty much any enemy in the game.\n\nYep, every single enemy is a playable character, and that actually feeds into a problem I have with the game.\n\nBack to my example at the start, I am reading the boss's attack patterns and reacting. I'm rewarded for learning the system and striking at the right time. The enemies in Odyssey, however, are really all just variations of your character with generally less openly useful moves. They block, dodge (Especially your projectiles), and can attack without warm-up most of the time. This means that you just have to take a lot of unavoidable damage each encounter just because there is no safe way through. Fighting your equals creates a cute dance, but it feels a lot more like battling Street Fighter AI rather than facing down Vergil.\n\nBut then there's a reason you're taking all that damage. Between your main character, his/her backup soldier, and the enemy you can morph into, you have three whole life bars. Match this up with persistent leveling and you can more or less kiss balancing goodbye. This will sound like heresy but I cleared the dungeon on my second try. For my reward, I unlocked the second town to start from, though I still have two characters to unlock as well as a third town. I only ever faced one midboss (Though he was absolutely no deviation from the standard enemies in combat style. Even the warlock himself felt like I was back to jump-kicking Akuma over and over.)\n\nI'll definitely go back to the game, but in the end I will likely forget it sooner rather than later.\n\nThis Warlock has some really boring dreams, to boot. Everything is muted, murky colors and all the enemies are just kinda ugly dull pitiable mutants.\n\nAlso, I have paid minimal attention to the story, and in return it has demanded precious little of my attention. I applaud the minimalist approach, though the huge dreary ugly world down here and all the story hints suggests we're going to be asked to pity that so tragic warlock because it's so dramatic to not have a villain (Really, having a proper villain seems like it would be the most shocking thing some games can do these days, but I digress. That's not Odyssey's problem...). Which actually brings me to a point I don't like about the story: You play as one of the few figments of the warlock's dreams that is not a slavering demon trying to kill everyone. You are not shocked by anything you see because you're a part of it. You can't die either, so you just keep coming back and trying again.\n\nBut the soldiers in the game are human beings just trying to fight the monsters of the abyss, protect their families, and when you fall, despite your immortality, they still will swoop in to do their damndest to save you. Hell, in my last clear, the soldier was the one who defeated the warlock (Only to poof out and be replaced by my character for the ending cutscene. What a snub!).\n\nSo you are playing an blob of memories with neither a personality nor a stake in this conflict and the people relegated to the sidelines are genuine heroes with personalities and fears who are to the last man engaging in wholly noble and heroic acts of holding the line against hordes of ugly monsters, all afraid, but all driven by duty. Someone at some point thought that it was better to tell the story of the Warlock's childhood trauma or whatever instead of the story of these gents. Good job on that.\n\nIf the story is somehow more interesting than NOW ON A VERY SPECIAL EPISODE OF ALL MY WARLOCKS, I welcome hints or even, properly marked, spoilers in the comments if you feel the need to convince me reading rather than playing the game is worthwhile.","July 16, 2014","false","2.5"," 10 of 25 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","10","25","0","0"

I wondered at first why this game was offering a pre-purchase discount, for over 2 weeks before it's launch, well now I know why... The game promised to have an in depth, well thought combat system, but immediately, it is very stale, boring, and simple. I bought the lie that this was a side-scroller "castlevania-eqsue" game with a unique "fighting style" combat system, and I was very disappointed. The worst is how an enemy who falls down is immune to all damage... You spend more time waiting for enemies to get their $%@ off the ground than you do actually fighting.This game is fun to look at, decently entertaining to run around in and meet the characters, but it is just simply not what the devs promised it to be.\n\nNow that the truth is out, I will say that this game IS very pretty. The artwork is awesome whenever you speak with a character. The art style is unique and obviously latin-inspired (of course). If for no other reason, buying this game simply to meet the characters and look at the artwork would make it feel semi-worth.\n\nPros:\nBeautiful artwork\nDecent Vocal Acting\nFun to get a new weapon\nVarious and diverse enemies\nFun to look at\n\nCons:\nTERRIBLE combat system\nUnintuitive abilities\nNo inventory system (cannot keep/sell old weapons/items)\nForced to watch enemies flail on the ground\n\n\nMy Inital reactions:\n\n*Have to pay in game gold to save the game and set checkpoints...\n\n*Enviroments are a bit stale, but still pretty detailed\n\n*Artwork is gorgeous in the chat scenes\n\n*Character feels a bit wonky when moving/jumping, but especially when landing, it's very odd...\n\n*Initial combat system is pretty to look at, but feels completely unintutitive, I sincerely hope this changes as the game goes on, because right now, the combat system feels terrible\n\n*It's not a big deal, however, I feel people should know you have to unlock the other characters to play as them. I wanted to jump right into the shadow monk (or whomever) however I cannot until I play more. Just a heads up.\n\n*Game just came out, so it's not 100% surprising, however, I've only played for 30 minutes so far, and have ran into 2 glitches already. 1 made the prologue impassible, had to restart, 2 game froze on screen switch\n\n*If an enemy falls on the ground, you cannot hurt them, or do anything to them... You have to wait for them to get back up... This feels odd and makes every single fight boring... You can't do much but hit twice, watch them fall, and just wait.... You may jugle enemies in the air, but the system isn't constructed well enough for that to work out in a dependable way...","July 15, 2014","false","2.3"," 9 of 23 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","9","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeoRizer/recommended/255070/","NeoRizer","NeoRizer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeoRizer/","368 products in account","So what happens when you take Castlevania Symphony of the Night... or more accurately Castlevania Aria / Dawn of Sorrow and combine it with Dark Souls clunk?\n\nWell let me answer that for you... You get a game about travelling in to a procedurally generated abyss delving deeper and deeper to kill some demon warlock Freddy Kruger guy, who's nightmares are your reality. In fact, you're not even real because he dreamt you up... except you want to kill him... that's what kind of game you get... yeah.\n\nSo this game tries way too hard to be epic and it just fails on just about every front. The art style is the only thing this game has going for it and it's just a shame it was wasted on such a giant turd like Abyss Odyssey. It's as if all the production value went in to the art style and none of it in to the game development, plot or music because it was all forgettable.\n\nIt's nothing new you haven't already seen, the point being is a lot of the game play mechanics are drab, boring and redundant... let me explain:\n\nIt's a rouge like game, where no dungeon you enter is ever the same twice... except that's kind of a lie because every area is almost exactly identical to the last, aside from some buzz saws and flowers trying to kill you.\n\nYou basically travel down a linear path and encounter a branching point here and there. These branching paths quickly lead to a dead end with a treasure chest or check point of some kind. Usually when there's nothing there I do what any veteran Casltevania player would do and smack the wall. 20% of the time there's a hidden area with a shop keeper or paltry weapon hiding behind it...\n\nNo meat though, I probably would of enjoyed a nice Castlevania roast beef here and there but no... it's usually just some crap.\n\nAnother thing about this game is how lazy the direction is... I mean, procedurally generated dungeons for a game with this kind of art style?\n\nWith all the effort put in to the art direction you figured they would of came up with some cool level designs and boss design concepts and made an actual game... you know, one where the developers have to always be one step ahead of themselves so players can't sequence break the game... either way it's wasted potential.\n\nThe game itself gets dull and tired way too quickly. It has unlockable characters and starting points but you need to rely heavily on luck... Okay basically everything resides on your luck, as well as time put in to the game.\n\nI beat the game once, unlocked some floaty chick with a spear who has a jelly fish for a companion (Yeah is this making you cringe yet? I was rolling my eyes the entire time... what pretentious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is this any way?)\n\nThere's also a heavy weapon user who looks a lot like Tyrael from the Diablo franchise (because THAT was purely a coincidence) and he's randomly unlocked by beating random bosses you encounter... random, random, random ....so have fun with randomly doing that.\n\nAnother thing that bothered me was the limited inventory space ... of 4 whole spaces. Enjoy managing poison antidotes, mana potions, health potions and check point tokens when you can basically only carry 1 of each item.\n\nThe number one biggest waste of resources though that made up most of the game's mechanics, or should I say gimmick, was the ENTIRE enemy capture system...\n\nI mean WTF is the point of all this? All the enemies I caught were even clunkier and weaker than my main character.... none of them had any really cool abilites and were all difficult to control... It's as if the developers were saying: "Hey switch to this centaur thing if you want to die... like right now... yeah there ya go, you're dead now, hope that helped."\n\nI never understood why the game forced you in to sequences where you had to play as random enemies either, other than to basically get their spirit afterwards... as some kind of reward? Great, thanks for THAT. Most of the time I had something better to do, like NOT playing as a worthless enemy character.\n\nEither way the game's plot and premise is a cryptic mess, just like Dark Souls, so I guess they got the worst possible aspects of that series right...\n\nClunky gameplay, in order to artificially increase the difficulty of the game; and a cryptic plot so it confuses the player in to thinking their mind has been "blown'.... except... no it hasn't, this game is just stupid and you're trying too hard to make sense of all of it...\n\nIt's a 5 out of 10 at best... it tries, it fails... go play Castlevania SotN... It's just a better game as well as the godfather of the genre... When are developers going to learn you can't reinvent perfection?","June 19, 2015","false","6.5"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","33","5","15","4","0"

Abyss Odyssey is a pretty decent rogue-style, side-scrolling dungeon crawler that can offer a few hours of entertainment.\n\nEnter the Abyss, a constantly changing nightmarish world with every load of your game. Choose among three different heroes, with different weapon-combat styles and spells at their disposal to vanquish the creatures of the Warlock's mind. To add a bit more to the customization, you are able to absorb a slain monster's soul, and make use of its skills to add to your own arsenal.\n\nCombat is quite fluid, and very easy using a game controller. Attacks are composed of simple directional and button combinations. Defensive maneuvers are composed of blocking, jumping and dodging around with the same ease in command. The combats give off a fighting game vibe - the AI is quite formidable at times as the use blocking and dodging as much as you do. (And they have a habit of just popping up around  you in different combinations.)\n\nThe game is packaged in a very pleasant art style resembling that of Tarot Cards (Art Nouveau, if you want to sound fancy.) Musical scoring is reminiscent of Castlevania which fans of the genre may find quite enjoyable.\n\nThe plot. Well. Don't expect much.\n\nNothing too fancy or ground breaking really - but it gets the job done with its simple mechanics. I actually haven't finished yet, as I'm still fumbling around with the three different heroes and trying to figure out which one I like the best. I haven't checked out any of the multi-player functions yet but I heard that it's quite good as well.\n\nIf you want something laid back, I'd really recommend this for you. My advice, again, get it on a sale day.","October 25, 2014","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combination of fighting games and roguelike elements has been under-represented since the PS1 era. (Hi, Tobal 2's Quest mode.)  Controls that draw from Smash Bros should have meant a maneuverable adventure game, something that should have had little difficulty surpassing Brawl's underwhelming Subspace Emissary mode.\n\nUnfortunately, that is not the game that ACE Team delivered.  I've waited quite a while to see if the game would change before posting my review, but I haven't seen evidence that my opinion will change.\n\nCombat simply feels off, as if it is sluggish or clunky.  Jumping feels floaty and forced.  Aerial moves do not mesh well with jumping.  While the control scheme in its most basic form is designed around the control scheme of Smash Bros, the actual mechanics and maneuverability (and lack thereof) are not.  The game relies on a cancel point system for combos, where you can cancel only if you have a 'cancel orb' available.  Cancel orbs are so important and integral to combat that you should spend your first levels unlocking them instead of upgrading moves, which begs the question of why they weren't unlocked from the start.  People will point to YouTube videos of various combos as examples of how amazing the combo system is, but those combos are almost always impractical within the single-player game itself.\n\n'Replay' consists in no small part of an unlock system that is designed to be a grind-driven time sink.  You cannot just encounter an enemy and defeat it to 'capture' it.  You have to have a full magic bar, and land a killing blow with a special capture move (that drains the bar regardless of success).  If it ended there, it might be acceptable, but the game goes further.  You have to be at a minimum level to capture an enemy, and the required level is heavily artificially inflated compared to the difficulty of the opponent.  The only solution is to grind your level through repeated plays of the same character.  It doesn't  matter that you can beat every enemy in the game when in your low teens for level.  The game will simply not let you capture various enemies until you are level 30, 40 or even 60, even if you have been beating that enemy without issue from the time that your level was a single digit value.\n\nAs for level design, Abyss Odyssey unfortunately functions as an example of the shortcomings of relying on procedural generation.  The component parts that the system has to rely upon simply aren't interesting, nor are the final results.\n\nAll in all, to some degree I feel a bit sorry for ACE Team.  They obviously tried, but their ambitions may simply have been beyond their abilities and business realities.  (A budget title with fighting game movesets and animations for all player characters and enemies?)\n\nDo I recommend the game? At full price, I find that I cannot.  However, if you do find the concept interesting, and find others say enough positive things, then perhaps consider buying it when it is at a good sale price.  At worst, you might find a disappointing title.  At best, you might find it a hidden gem that you will continue to play.  I, unfortunately, fell into the former category.  Others have obviously fallen into the latter.","January 25, 2015","false","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SiCk4/recommended/255070/","SiCk4","r|h","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SiCk4/","117 products in account","I love metroidvania games and I rarely write reviews, but I think this game has the potential to be a great game with only a few tweaks, so here I go...\n\nAlthough I really enjoyed several elements of the actual game (gorgeous visuals, music, level design, enemies and heroes characters and that low price is surreal for such an ambitious project), there are currently three BIG design ideas that I really hate:\n\n-Friendly Fire, I won't even argue much here as this is really obvious and already posted by several other reviewers - if you want to make co-op thoughtful in your game keep the "colision" part, but get rid of the damage! Just one additional note, friendly fire in fast paced platformers specially this one with a 2D fighting games combat system vibe simply don’t work well. It works much more towards increasing frustration, avoidance and restrict experimentation than adding excitement or tactical / strategic elements gameplay-wise.\n\n-Clunky controls, the controls schema is ok, but far from perfect. I'm using a X360 joystick and it would be great if the controls were as responsive as in some other recent 2D platformers like "Dust: An Elysian Tail", "Shank 2", "Valdis Story" etc or even real fighting games like "SFIV", "KoF 13" (slower) or "UMvC", BlazBlue" (faster) - specially the movement aspect: to block, parry, turn and recover.\n\n-No way to "save" between levels (there is a temporary way, an expensive and painful one, which means if you don't have the proper item, are far away in the Abyss and dies or don't have the time to finish the game, it's basically: gameover). FIX: just add automatic checkpoints in the current altars. For those of you that think this is a “casual gamer” request, let me elaborate: If you are not a bon vivant teenager and don’t have the spare time to play beginning to end every time you start the game (around 1h15) you will never enjoy this game as it already happened to me twice since launch when I got only about 20 minutes to play per session in my scarce free time. Checkpoints are needed to fix a design flaw that forces players to “play to the end at once or never play it”. PS: I hope you guys realize a checkpoint to save progress is a completely different thing than a free Healing Altar!\n\nI always try to respect and understand designer decisions (they are there for a reason), so for the first two points and to please everybody, simply adding a "Turn On/Off" option would solve it. Or even a difficult setting: Option1 (checkpoint to save + disable friendly fire) and Option2 (save costs items/gold + enable friendly fire).\n\nI believe this game has the potential to became one of the best 2D platformer games of all time, otherwise I promisse you I would never write a review this long, so hopefuly the devs will check the player's reviews and work on patches and enhancements. Until there, I found it hard to keep playing and/or recommend.\n\n\nEDIT:\nTo end the silly “casual” versus “hardcore” arguing here, let me be very direct: AO is a really easy-to-beat game once you get the basics and have the mandatory free time (just learn to properly parry and level up your char to unlock the 3 cancels: done). If you believe my negative review points to help enhance the overall game experience is a simply “nerf the game’s difficult!” you are insanely mistaken.  If you want to play a hard game and not make a fool of yourself here, go play Dwarf Fortress (PC) or Battletoads (NES) – both great games btw.\n\nEDIT2:\nKudos to developers! Only two days after release and patch 1.01 is already out fixing a major complain in the game (Toggle Friendly Fire On/Off is now possible), increasing some control responsiveness issues and more!\n\nEDIT3:\nAfter reinstalling the game and checking over the last updates I've changed my status review to a "recommended" game. Gameplay and other balances greatly improved in the last update! Kudos to developers!\n\nBest regards,","July 15, 2014","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","28"

I just didn't grab me or look exciting. I remember watching them and being unimpressed by them, but the thought of a street fighter/smash bros style dungeon crawler was pretty irresistable. I ended up buying it cos It was cheap.\n\nPeople complained in the reviews that the coop is stupid because you can't turn friendly fire off, well, they patched that so if you want to play the game with an 8 year old then that now becomes viable... and fun.\n\nThe gfx are good, the sound is ok (I don't know who would want to buy the music - bleugh), some of the monsters are pretty cool but I think a lot of them have weird moves and aren't very smooth. I think the gameplay is responsive enough but here is my biggest gripe : The combos don't work from training mode. I loved Marvel vs Capcom 3 because of the awesome, fun combos you can do consistantly. Abyss Odyssey includes a training mode that you can practice combos, but the problem is that the advanced combos that work on the training dummy don't work on the monsters in the game (at least not for me). That training dummy juggles easily but my dash-cancel jump combos just wiff on the in-game monsters. There also doesn't seem like there are enough moves per character. The supporting characters feel really restricted with their move set.\n\nI think the thing I love the most about this game is the concept. I've had to improvise my combos in game to see what works and what doesn't and the difficutly is pretty high - especialy on Nightmare mode. I guess I'm one of those players that love a challenge and when I get beaten I keep coming back for more.\n\nThe online multiplayer is pretty buggy at the moment so don't rely on that. I understand they are working on it, but as of now - it's plagued with problems. If you have a friend/child you can play with then there is still lots of fun to be had, especially with the 4 player vs mode. And if you can trust them to not throw fireballs into your back, turn friendly fire on and play like a pro.\n\n","August 16, 2014","true","34.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lovely to look at. I don't think anyone expected anything else. Though rather then the Fantasy-Punk vibe of Zeno Clash it is instead something of an Art Nouveau fever dream. Its distinctly late 19th century Chilean, and honestly that makes it feel almost as unique as ZenoClash. Simply because of the lack of well, games with that vibe.\n\nThe Fighting: It is not bad. It is also not that great. It reminds me heavily of the old Squeenix brawlers like The Bouncer or Ergheiz (especially the adventure mode) The primary point that needs to be understood is you absolutely must cancel animations in a careful pattern to actually make combos.  There are moves with a certain number of hits, but chaining together moves and quickly dispatching enemies, or preventing yourself from being torn apart requires a different skillset then most fighting games do. It's kind of like Orb Walking in a MOBA. I enjoy it greatly, but I think it should be called a 'side-scrolling combo-brawler' over a 'fighting game'. The only flaw I see is it takes some getting used to to figure out how not to get stuck in animations, and some things feel unresponsive. (Turning isn't as bad as people say it is, but it COULD use some work. I imagine it'll be tweaked in the future.  I also have a feelong allot of the extremely negative reviews are from earlier builds as right now, it's quick.)\n\nThe story: Small, compact, folklore rich and not particularly invasive. Its not some mesmerising story with a gripping narrative, but its a functional fairy-tale that conveys a rich and enthralling world. It takes multiple trips into the abyss to actually tell its tale.\n\nThe Monster-Capture-thing: Gonna be honest, I am sad. SAD I SAY. I reeeaaaaally am a sucker for cute monsters, and would love to just be able to choose them at the start of the game after catching them. However, despite people's reviews, they're more then a damage sponge (an alternate pool of hitpoints, really) While they can serve that purpose, they've got interesting movesets with specific advantages. Some of these can be used to cheaply deal with certain enemies. (The mimic can absolutely trash a few for instance) While others are more all around useful and versatile or even allow better terrain navigation. (Pudutaur is incredibly mobile and has fantastic range on her melee)\n\nFinally. Pudu-Taur. Seriously. Pudutaur. That enough should sell the game. Don't know what a pudu is? Look it up. Pudutaur.\n\nPudutaur.","December 29, 2014","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It starts out hard, but gets easier as you get used to the mechanics.

Friendly fire is a feature of the game, and being a side scroller beat-em-up means that combos are pivotal to clearing harder content. That being said, being juggled in your friend's combo while you can't do anything but watch and die means that you're not actually playing the game and since the encounter screen is quite limited this happens more often than you'd think.\n\nI'd say overall that it's a fun experience and definitely worth playing.

The art style is gorgeous and the sound track is solid.  The voice acting is pretty good with some well known names and the overall design and aesthetic of the world is very interesting and focuses on mythology seldom seen in other games.\n\nThen there's the combat.  Others may be able to enjoy it, but I have had so many issues with the stiff, frequently unresponsive controls.  The enemy AI is at times deceptively cheap and evil and also at times very thick, with enemies patiently waiting for me to get done with their buddy ten feet away before coming at me.  Maybe this has to do with the controls being based on fighting games, but it feels like a poor man's super smash brothers and the character's movesets are remarkably shallow.\n\nIt helps that you can capture and play as almost all the enemies in the game, but their moves are similarly shallow.\n\nI enjoyed this game for a bit, but it requires many play throughs.  I haven't finished them all and I'm not sure I will.  It's worth playing for the experience, but overall, it could have been better.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/baseman/recommended/255070/","baseman","Base","http://steamcommunity.com/id/baseman/","272 products in account","This game is actually quite good. I'm impressed with how many techniques they were able to take from fighting games, and the execution of them inside a platformer Roguelike is doubly impressive. The game is set up similar to a roguelike dungeon crawl-- go in, fight your way to the bottom, fighting a few bosses along the way, and defeating a final boss. But what makes it so good is the depth of the mechanics, and how they work together-- You may choose from three basic characters, yet there are many more available. To get them, you have to defeat them with a super and then you can pick up their soul-- and thus, you are now playing as a fully featured character whenever you want to transform. While you can only carry one soul at a time, it gives a much deeper mechanic to the game: Should you opt for a monster early on to help you along, or save the super to get one you really want later? It takes quite some time to fill up the mana meter, so the choice is important, as it gives you a whole life bar to survive longer. Each enemy plays completely differently, but gives a great deal depth as a result.\n\nOne thing that should be mentioned is that the game might feel somewhat slow and a bit clunky at first. I feel this is actually a good thing, though, as it leaves the player able to improve and attack much faster than is initially able, giving a real sense of progression in an intuitive way. This ties into progressing: If you're not good enough to defeat the enemies, you won't reach the end.\n\nSpeaking of the enemies, they are NPC opponents, which inevitably means they're 'not perfect'. That is to say, they're sometimes too perfect and too good at reading what you're going to do. I'd love to see more work made to improve on enemy AI as the game's life progresses, but this is my only real gripe, and it's not even a big one. The enemies are certainly able to be defeated, it's more of a survival gauntlet than anything, but sometimes they adjust their behaviours a little too fast when you input something.\n\nAll in all, an extremely enjoyable game, which I hope will have a fruitful life and a large community. The quality is astounding for the price of the game; puts many AAA games to shame.","August 18, 2014","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All and all it feels out of place at first, but it's easy enough to get used to. Speaking of characters, the design of this game is unlike anything I've seen before; many of the monsters the player encounters are very interesting to look at, and often have eerie glowing or melting effects to them. This entire game really looks strange, yet at the same time great.\nOther than that this is just an RPG rougelite where dying sends you back to the start without your equipment, but leveling and cash stay with you after death. I'm not the biggest fan of procedurally-generated enviroments, but the dungeon this game takes place in is varied enough to keep my attention.\n\nIn the end I have to say that this really is a good game. My only real complaint is that attack inputs often feel wonky or unresponsive since you're probably not going to learn the attacks of all the characters you play as.\n\n\nAlso a lot of people are complaining about co-op and KB/M controls.\nDunno anything about these; I've been playing this game alone with a 360 controller","October 31, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's almost as if you're trying to play the more recent Street Fighter games in a platformer on the highest difficulty possible.\n\nThere's three main characters and each has a soldier that jumps in when they die, basically like a second life. If you can get to an altar the main character resurrects and you continue on with them. The soldiers have similar combat styles as their corresponding main character but have different melee and special moves. Then you can absorb the soul of nearly any enemy in the game, even the bosses apparently, and fight as them. Each of them also has their own melee and special moves.\n\nEnemies seem to be reasonably varied, though three specific ones will be seen often the entire way through the game. As I said above, they all have their own attacks which they all like to use to stunlock and air juggle you until you die.\n\nSo, can I recommend this? I'm not sure. If you like Metroidvania style games and can deal with the complexities of the combat here, then yes. If not you may want to give this one a pass. Based upon my own experience and feelings, I have to lean slightly more towards the 'no' side.","January 11, 2015","false","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combination of fighting games and roguelike elements has been under-represented since the PS1 era. (Hi, Tobal 2's Quest mode.)  Controls that draw from Smash Bros should have meant a maneuverable adventure game, something that should have had little difficulty surpassing Brawl's underwhelming Subspace Emissary mode.\n\nUnfortunately, that is not the game that ACE Team delivered.  I've waited quite a while to see if the game would change before posting my review, but I haven't seen evidence that my opinion will change.\n\nCombat simply feels off, as if it is sluggish or clunky.  Jumping feels floaty and forced.  Aerial moves do not mesh well with jumping.  While the control scheme in its most basic form is designed around the control scheme of Smash Bros, the actual mechanics and maneuverability (and lack thereof) are not.  The game relies on a cancel point system for combos, where you can cancel only if you have a 'cancel orb' available.  Cancel orbs are so important and integral to combat that you should spend your first levels unlocking them instead of upgrading moves, which begs the question of why they weren't unlocked from the start.  People will point to YouTube videos of various combos as examples of how amazing the combo system is, but those combos are almost always impractical within the single-player game itself.\n\n'Replay' consists in no small part of an unlock system that is designed to be a grind-driven time sink.  You cannot just encounter an enemy and defeat it to 'capture' it.  You have to have a full magic bar, and land a killing blow with a special capture move (that drains the bar regardless of success).  If it ended there, it might be acceptable, but the game goes further.  You have to be at a minimum level to capture an enemy, and the required level is heavily artificially inflated compared to the difficulty of the opponent.  The only solution is to grind your level through repeated plays of the same character.  It doesn't  matter that you can beat every enemy in the game when in your low teens for level.  The game will simply not let you capture various enemies until you are level 30, 40 or even 60, even if you have been beating that enemy without issue from the time that your level was a single digit value.\n\nAs for level design, Abyss Odyssey unfortunately functions as an example of the shortcomings of relying on procedural generation.  The component parts that the system has to rely upon simply aren't interesting, nor are the final results.\n\nAll in all, to some degree I feel a bit sorry for ACE Team.  They obviously tried, but their ambitions may simply have been beyond their abilities and business realities.  (A budget title with fighting game movesets and animations for all player characters and enemies?)\n\nDo I recommend the game? At full price, I find that I cannot.  However, if you do find the concept interesting, and find others say enough positive things, then perhaps consider buying it when it is at a good sale price.  At worst, you might find a disappointing title.  At best, you might find it a hidden gem that you will continue to play.  I, unfortunately, fell into the former category.  Others have obviously fallen into the latter.","January 25, 2015","false","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though I am not very good at the game, I continue to come back to it because I am curious to see what will happen next and what new environments will be revealed as I slowly progress into the abyss.\n\nI highly recommend this game.

Finely drawn stills with clumsy polygonal animation and stunted voice acting. Welcome to a rogue-lite adventure where the combat may drive you mad, or be your cup of tea. A well planned introduction that is going to steep you in combat mechanics you either have the reflexes for or are willing to practice to obtain.\n\nHaving never been competent at fighting games (I beat Street Fighter II on the SNES but once at difficulty 'III'), I admit I'm in over my head and instantly grateful for the weapon and moveset upgrading system. If I've any chance at all, that alone is to be thanked.\n\nThis is a lucious game, and there's a lot to love, if you're a genre fan. Awkward voiceovers can be overlooked, the base character leveling system gives less skilled players a chance. Unfortunately the character animations are quite stilted and lack the polish that would have better integrated them into the classic, 1890s art style.\n\nFor an indie, this is an impressive start but for full price this is too much to ask for casual players. This is no minor distraction, but a lore rich, gorgeously presented nightmare. Know your quarry before spending your coin.","January 18","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although I'm not into Dark Souls, I've played it a bit, and that game at least gives you some serious power if you're careful and level up a few times. You get to keep your equipment and only lose the XP (souls) you hadn't spent yet if you die twice. In Abyss Odyssey, however, there's just a feeling of no progress at all. Honestly, I would recommend Rogue Legacy if you want a 2D roguelite experience that does it right. Check out folks' reviews for Rogue Legacy if you haven't tried it before but like the idea of a difficult but fair game with gradual growth even when you lose and start over.

The game is basically running the same yet different (Randomly rearranged) dungeon over and over.\nThe leveling is pointless really, it's simply a gate on which souls you can capture.\nReally doesn't feel like there's much of an end goal to it, since winning just lets you start again and dying starts you again. I haven't managed to win yet but I'd assume you'd get to keep your weapons in that case.

It focus on the Hero/Soldier duality, when the Hero dies then a Soldier comes to continue it's progress. You have a chance to revive the Hero at an Altar if you make it that far. The Soldiers are weaker but still capable on their own and provide an interesting gameplay ideia: you're forced to do with the Soldiers what you could not do with the Hero.\n\nThe art style is incredible, all characters including enemies are very well design and the environments fit well within the game. The combat is varied and allows you to choose between 3 Heros + 3 Soldiers + about 20 different monsters you can summon once in a while. Each one has its own style and unique special abilities.\n\nThe game is a bit difficult, to get to the final boss you have to pass through many levels with different difficulties and if both your Hero and Soldier dies you're back to square one. There are checkpoints along the way to save progress but these require tokens which are quite expensive. Any attempt to defeat the final boss is an expedition that requires preparation and nerves of steel.\n\nPros:\n- Amazing art style\n- 3 heros to choose + a bunch of other playable characters\n- Good combat\n- Random generated levels improve replayability\n- Made by the Zeno-Clash boys, guaranteed seal of Awesomeness\n\nCons:\n- Controls are a bit slugish\n- Better to play with Xbox controller\n- Being bum-rushed to death happens from time to time\n- Random generated levels end up being repetitive\n- Difficulty","October 25, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For those who are impatient, try to give it a chance. It gets better with time, and really ends up being a bit of a gem.\n\nPost-beating the game edit: this is a Metroid-vania platformer with Smash Bros combat (combat is literally identical in every way to Smash Bros). The game can feel slightly clunky but I believe it is more a result of the animations than the actual controls. Controls are very tight and responsive but the animations and hitboxes can make it "feel" clunky at first, at least until you get used to them.\n\nQuick pros: easy to jump into, combat can be fun, multiplayer seems like it would be fun in a non-serious way\n\nQuick cons: difficulty can seem really imbalanced at times, not enough character development or immersion in regards to the story\n\n7.5/10","November 4, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is the short attention span summary of my review: Abyss Odyssey combines a myriad of genres to provide a unique experience that might not be to everyone’s taste. The platforming is wonky, the combat takes some adjusting, and the game is ruthless in its challenge. Enemies will react to your every move and pay you back in kind, plus the randomness of the dungeon layouts can work both for or against you and involve a lot of luck. Still, if you’re a fan of all of the genres represented here and can handle the steep difficulty, you’ll likely have a good time. Especially if you have a friend available to play along with you.","October 16, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The player is tasked with venturing deep into the procedurally generated abyss with the goal of killing a warlock. In order to accomplish their goal, the player must learn the secrets of the abyss through trial and error. failure is common.\n\nThroughout the abyss, the player will battle a multitude of dangerous creatures through melee combat. This combat feels sluggish and stiff initially. Later on however, it becomes much more enjoyable as the player masters the combat system and unlocks more moves. As a result Abyss Odyssey runs the risk of turning new players away before it gets interesting. Players who persevere are rewarded as they learn how best to combo moves and abilities together effectively, yet even in it's later stages, it lacks some of the polish found in other side scrolling Beat 'em ups. I found that using a controller helped a bit with some of the combat's issues, as the game was clearly designed with a gamepad in mind. Altogether the combat is decent, but not great. Little things like not being able to change directions in the middle of a combo and poor aerial combat drag the experience down. Where Abyss Odyssey's combat makes up for it's lack of polish is in variety. The number of playable characters is surprisingly impressive, and while many are not as developed as others, they still help change up the combat occasionally.\n\nI was also pleasantly surprised by Abyss Odyssey's procedurally generated level design. While nothing groundbreaking, the levels it generates feel well constructed and reasonably different. While they still lack the same tightly focused nature of many hand-made levels, they serve as a good backdrop for the game's combat, even mixing in a bit of light platforming to break things up. Throughout these levels Abyss Odyssey offers the player many opportunities to make risk reward based choices which leverage immediate reward against the risk of long term peril. While a nice system, I rarely found any situations where the risks outweighed the benefits, effectively undermining the tension these systems could have created if they were more effectively balanced.\n\nAbyss Odyssey's most notable feature is its art and music. The environments on display are beautiful to look at and manage to help disguise the procedural generation. Character designs are especially good. Each one is reasonably interesting to look at. As a result, I always enjoyed seeing what creature I would stumble upon next. Abyss Odyssey's soundtrack is also fairly good, and manages to capture the mood of the game just right. I especially liked the eerie guitar pieces, which add to the unique atmosphere.\n\nDespite it's numerous flaws, I still believe I can give Abyss Odyssey a cautious recommendation. Anyone interested in a procedurally generated Beat 'em up will likely be satisfied, so long as they can overlook some frustrating design elements.","October 22, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All and all it feels out of place at first, but it's easy enough to get used to. Speaking of characters, the design of this game is unlike anything I've seen before; many of the monsters the player encounters are very interesting to look at, and often have eerie glowing or melting effects to them. This entire game really looks strange, yet at the same time great.\nOther than that this is just an RPG rougelite where dying sends you back to the start without your equipment, but leveling and cash stay with you after death. I'm not the biggest fan of procedurally-generated enviroments, but the dungeon this game takes place in is varied enough to keep my attention.\n\nIn the end I have to say that this really is a good game. My only real complaint is that attack inputs often feel wonky or unresponsive since you're probably not going to learn the attacks of all the characters you play as.\n\n\nAlso a lot of people are complaining about co-op and KB/M controls.\nDunno anything about these; I've been playing this game alone with a 360 controller","October 31, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's really cool.\n+ The RPG elements are pretty well done, although I'm not too sure about the skill points.

But maybe I'm just a noob at this game.\n- Unsure about the replay value.

I'm not going to say vague things like the controls are "heavy", tell you what art style it is, or load my review up with quotes. No offense to anyone.\n\nThis game is awesome. Let me express some things.\n-First, the combat system is actually very good. AI is well done and while exploits exist the oppostion isn't given crazy stupid powerful moves to compensate for lack of design. As well, if you think anything is overpowered guess what? You get to use a dream catcher and become one.\n-If you want to button mash use the ghost monk, it has very straightforward arcing attacks and the bouncing ball of flame can hit stuff you didn't even know it was going to hit. Not that you can't get skilled with the ghost monk. If you want to play quick and use reflexes play as katrien. If you want a mind puzzle that pays off use pincoya.\n-Use the surroundings to fight, it's one of the best things you can use to fight. If you have a guard helping try to flank your opponents.\n-Keep your enemies back by striking. You can hit one, dodge across the room, and hit another. Then jump dodge back to the first. One of the really cool things about this game is both you and the enemy get to hit on your way up from the floor and can dodge straight through some attacks. One great thing to do with a bit of practice is to use a ranged attack to get your opponent to dodge straight into your weapon. When they end their dodge you have a free shot for a follow up combo.\n- When you get to the fountain room you can get all the gold, take your time killing all the lame monsters for xp, and pick up a couple health potions, then exit the game and come back and do it again. Multiple times! Which is great to do if you don't like dying. But honestly, get ready to die. This game let's you keep everything but your gear. And rewards you after you die usually. You get new characters and all. Don't take it too personally, you literally only start back at the top and lose gear. Which you will regain from another waltz below.\n-Gear - Buy what you need. But everything has it's place. High damage output can be the difference between trying real hard to keep your health up and just walking through enemies. But I probably wouldn't buy high damage gear until I'm looking to get real low in the abyss. Accept that you'll die and have fun. One of the coolest things about this game is that you won't retain or have access to the same gear. You'll pick up a couple gear pieces most likely and buy a couple others. You might find some gear that you buy anytime you can find it. You might change your combat style because certain items are just too hard to get a hold of. You might end up like me forced to play something unusual and end up loving it.\n-If you are low on health, not a ton of awesome gear and an altar nearby... die. Let the guard hoof it back to the alter and reward you with full health. What a champ. And on that note. Dodge/attack is one of the best things a guard can do in combat.\n-Wear out your dreamcatcher first. After the monster you are turned into dies you come back as you. You can also change out of monster form to pick up health globes. And mana globes collected automatically go to your characters mana bar.\n-Use camp tokens in the earlier levels. Especially before the fountain room. It let's you stock up on things and gives you plenty chances to run into merchants that can sell you things for your big fight at the bottom.\n-Don't expect Nightmare mode to be beatable. It's supposed to be stupid hard. Laugh when you die. You're playing nightmare mode, you probably aren't that sane to begin with.\n\nIf you do all these things you will likely enjoy the game much, much more... the game you probably spent like <$10 dollars on. It's not hard to live up to $10.","September 4, 2015","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I hear clunky I think unresponsive, slow, or even glitched controls. I was initially turned off to buying the game because of this, but got it on sale anyway because it looked cool. I have to say I don't understand the complaints.  If you're looking to mash endlessly with gigantic hitboxes, then yeah you may not like the feel of the combat. Instead you have to consider each of your options and how to string them together to make them effective. It has a 2d fighting gamey feel in that each attack has specific ranges in which they are effective and everything can be special cancelled (up to three times in one combo). As a fan of many fighting games I enjoy this aspect of the game. Seeing what kind of combos you can pull off with each character and enemy soul is pretty fun. It is certainly a unique experience and I look forward to a sequel in the future.","September 13, 2015","true","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zabu_san/recommended/255070/","zabu_san","♫ ざぶ_さん ♫","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zabu_san/","168 products in account","ACE Team are keen on creating memorable, talked-about games, and their latest creation, Abyss Odyssey, will do just that. In a blend of Metroidvania-esque levels, rogue-like gameplay and setup, and Chilean-inspired themes, settings, and design Abyss Odyssey will test your patience. But like the Souls franchise, you will keep coming back for more and more punishment. Why? Because you will never let a game get the better of you, and as a gamer, you have to see those credits roll. Okay, perhaps Abyss Odyssey isn’t that hardcore, but you get the idea. ACE Team has recaptured an idea that has worked for 20+ years with series like Mega Man, Castlevania, and Metroid. And while it’s not a complete overhaul of the genre, it’s a step in the right direction for the side-scrolling dungeon crawler genre.\n\nEveryone’s game will start the same: you’ll control Katrien, whose Rapier will allow you to make considerable progress through the procedurally generated dungeons on your way to tackle the Warlock in the Abyss. I say considerable due to the fact that it’s unlikely you’ll make it too far before Katrien is defeated and you must then, as a weak soldier, return to a nearby resurrection altar and return her to life, or start over from the beginning. Not all is lost if you die though, as your solider ‘spirit’ (so to speak) isn’t completely useless, but he’s a much weaker competitor than you yourself. Katrien (and your soldier companion) has a bevy of attacks and special moves to accompany you in your journey ranging from arching swipes, to fireballs, and sliding attacks. Utilized in conjunction with one another makes her a satisfying warrior, but the no-so-tight controls and platforming leads level exploration a lot to be desired.\n\nPlatforming games have been around for decades, and they aren’t going anywhere, and when I get my hands on one, I’m personally spoiled by them. Having played every Mario game to death, Nintendo has perfected platforming; and with 2D Castlevania and Metroid games helping cement how graceful platformers can be, playing a game that’s a step back is really frustrating. Abyss Odyssey’s isn’t the worst of the genre, but it’s not up there with the best either. Most of the time, you can double jump then dash over crevices, but occasionally you come upon the dreaded ‘ledge’ wherein it’s 90% impossible to overcome unless you’re facing the right direction. Turning to get in the right direction is a bit of a delay, this making even the simplest of things, such as turning your character(s), rather cumbersome. Yes, this sounds almost elementary, but when you’re trying to hurriedly get somewhere and you’re halted in climbing due to such a minor inconvenience, it’s immensely frustrating. Again, it’s not ‘bad’, but it’s unsatisfying when it happens more often than it should.\n\nAnother issue with Abyss Odyssey is its lack of real direction in terms of explaining what you can and cannot do. For example, when your mana meter builds, you’re able to unleash an attack that not only deals damage, but allows you to capture the soul of your foe. You’re then able to freely switch between the soul of your newly acquired demon, each with their own set of attacks and moves, to help in the journey. Unfortunately, none if this is really implied or explained. ACE Team has created a world I want to explore, but provides no understanding of the rules or regulations. As far as plot goes (another lacking feature as far as its delivery) comes in the form of pages of the Warlock’s journal that randomly drop from vanquished adversaries. The twenty page journal tells you everything about the Warlock’s beginning, middle, and end, but not much else aside from small bits about the creatures in the Abyss. I’m all for subtlety and minimalism, but at some point explanation and direction is needed, and Abyss Odyssey loses on that front.\n\nWhat’s found in Abyss Odyssey is a solid exploratory platformer with minor aggravations, but with rich design marred by poor direction and exposition. You will spend hours upon hours collecting enemies, hunting through the various dungeons, and defeating the famed Warlock; and then come back for more. With multiple playable characters, each with their own distinctive characteristics and attacks, there’s enough content to provide second and third playthroughs. And while we were unable to test this while playing pre-embargo, ACE Team promises a ton of continuous changes and additions to the game as more and more people complete the task of defeating the Warlock. Abyss Odyssey holds a world of fun in itself. In the end though, it’s just a shame that what’s here, although it isn’t genre-changing, isn’t enough to pull it from the depths of a dozen of other lookalikes. There’s a bevy of treasures to discover in the great below, however, so don’t pass up the chance to explore it. When Abyss Odyssey stares in to you, smirk and say ‘let’s go’!\n\n(Review via Front Towards Gamer: http://ftg.operationsupplydrop.org/2015/02/09/hyperdimension-neptunia-rebirth-1-review-pc/)","May 26, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first the controls feel clunky but once you get a handle of things, it works out. The graphics, voice acting, aesthetics and overall atmosphere is wonderful and engaging, and the mechanic of controlling lesser creatures is pretty cool too, though it may take a while before you get there. The gameplay is also pretty cool, and it's fun leveling up a character and unleashing fun combos on enemies. Training mode is your friend. The rogue-like elements are also well-balanced; you keep all gold but lose items/weapons, so you actually progress further down the cave each time, but it's still difficult, and you may still lose on the first segment.\n\nHowever, changing directions in this game is clunky at times, unlike the rest of the controls. It feels like wading through gelatin. I'd recommend it on sale, or if you like rogue-likes. Maybe also if you like Trine. But otherwise, try playing another RPG, rogue-like, or maybe even a fighting game.\n\n\nOriginal Review:\nDon't let the 'Full Controller Support' thing fool you - PS3 and PS4 controllers are NOT supported and the developers don't care. And playing with a keyboard is an awful experience; akin to playing Mortal Kombat or some other fighting game using just a mouse.","January 20, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combat works just like in a fighting game, every character/enemy has a proper move set, but instead of just a one screen arena, you have to fight through a randomized dungeon with multiple floors and paths.\nThe game has around 40 characters, three of them are main characters with the ability to capture enemy souls. This is one of the key features of the game, because once you capture a soul you can use that enemy/boss in the game. There are some ballance issues with this though, some are near worthless some are op and this can impact versus mode.\nHowever it's not just a regular figthing game with platforming. The game has co-op and an inventory system, your main charactes can level up and gain skill points to strengthen moves they have found.\n\nSound/Music;\nMusic is excellent, sometimes reminds me of Castlevania, it creates a good atmosphere for the levels and characters. But it doesn't have any "God tier" songs that I would put on my mp3 player so it's "just" a 9 out of 10.\n\nGraphics;\nNothing extraordinary here, good dungeon prop variety and nice backgrounds makes the dungeons look good.\nBut that's it, doesn't look bad or particularly good, it serves it's purpose.\n\nArt desing;\nAbsolutely fantastic and very creative. The characters are very well designed, they are intersting, beautiful, creepy, terrifying. Things that look like a nightmare or a dream. (the game takes place in a nightmare) Levels are beautiful, and sometimes weird dream like. The menu is super cool.\n\nControls;\nOh my GOD the controls they seem bad, and they kinda are. But they aren't that bad once you figured out,  that you can actually climb over the ledges by pushing jump right next to them!!  You can also walljump which is completely useless and annoying. Blocking and dodging can get awkward too sometimes. Also might need X360ce for your controller to function.\n\nReplay value;\nRandomly generated dungeons with loot and secrets, every enemy has like a dozen moves not just 2 or 3 and you can play as enemies and bosses. With random encounters to keep things interesting. (some of them are pretty creative) It also has versus mode and co-op.","December 18, 2015","true","35.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is always refreshing to play a game that has interesting characters\n\n+ One of the main aspects of the game is that you can collect enemy spirits by filling up your mana bar and then unleashing a devastating area of effect attack. Once you collect an enemy spirit you can then transform into that enemy and play as them. The game has quite a few enemies so capturing and trying out all the different enemies is fun. The only stipulation is that you have to be the same level or higher in order to capture an enemy.\n\n+ The game has 3 main playable characters. You start with one but unlock the other 2 through different means. Each character has their own weapons, attacks and special attacks.\n\n+ As you level up you gain skill points to upgrade your special attacks. You can either make them do more damage, get more mana or provide you with defensive abilities.\n\n+ Soundtrack\n\nThe Average:\n\nGiven the unique art style, the level design is comparatively bland. This is a 2D roque game so each level is randomized. Although each level is designed differently in some way, every level feels the same. I find games like Spelunky and  even Risk of Rain to be good examples of randomization done right. The levels in those games truly feel different, hazardous and unique as you progress through the levels. Making it through those levels feels like an accomplishment, this game does not. Although there are plenty of environmental hazards to avoid the game is more about combat than navigating the levels.\n\nYou will either love or hate the combat. The combat IS good IF you take to the time to master it. The combat is a bit reminiscent of a 2D fighting game and it comes with some pretty advanced techniques to learn if you truly want to get the most out of it. The majority of players will probably just keep spamming their favorite special attacks over and over again.\n\n\nGold is useless. When you die you lose all currently equipped items which makes sense given the fact it's a rogue game however you get to retain your gold and experience making subsequent runs through the abyss easier. Many of the items the shopkeepers sell is usually over priced and since you lose your equipment anyways, buying any equipment feels somewhat pointless\n\n\nConclusion\n\nIt certainly is a very unique game something that I would expect from the developers of Zeno Clash. The combat is good and trying out all the different enemies is awesome the problem is everything else that makes a roque game good is average in this game.  This game certainly has potential to be a great game and a sequel that fleshes out some of the ideas would really help.","September 16, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You need to learn how the enemies fight and you need to build and adjust your characters skills and special attacks in order to progress.\n\nSome have described Abyss Odyssey as a mix of Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Castlevania? That comparision is only partly correct: the gameplay reminds me a bit of Super Smash Bros Brawl, but not Castlevania. Unlike in Castlevania, in this game, you cannot just whip&One-Shot-Kill basic enemies. A mob of low-level enemies can easily hack'n slash you into pieces, if you are not careful. Health vials are scarse, mana-vials are even more rare and good weapons cost a lot of coins. Did I mention there are no free save-points? In order to save progress, you need to grind enough coins, then you need to find a merchant who sells a camp token, and then you need to find an altar to use a camp token to have one or maybe two retries from that particular point.\n\nThe game graphics are sounds are awesome, but I am personally more attracted by the fair challenge of this game. The game is quite merciful to some degree: for example, dying does not automatically reset your character experience and it does not strip you from your special attacks you built, only your weapons and items are lost, and you are returned to one of the three starting stages.\n\nI'd say learning to use different attacks and gradually proceeding in this game is the main hook, so for skill-oriented players looking for a bit of a challenge in a game, this is one to pick.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thestubiter/recommended/255070/","thestubiter","TheStubiter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thestubiter/","156 products in account","Abyss Odyssey is procedurally generated, side scrolling Beat 'em up. The player is tasked with venturing deep into the procedurally generated abyss with the goal of killing a warlock. In order to accomplish their goal, the player must learn the secrets of the abyss through trial and error. failure is common.\n\nThroughout the abyss, the player will battle a multitude of dangerous creatures through melee combat. This combat feels sluggish and stiff initially. Later on however, it becomes much more enjoyable as the player masters the combat system and unlocks more moves. As a result Abyss Odyssey runs the risk of turning new players away before it gets interesting. Players who persevere are rewarded as they learn how best to combo moves and abilities together effectively, yet even in it's later stages, it lacks some of the polish found in other side scrolling Beat 'em ups. I found that using a controller helped a bit with some of the combat's issues, as the game was clearly designed with a gamepad in mind. Altogether the combat is decent, but not great. Little things like not being able to change directions in the middle of a combo and poor aerial combat drag the experience down. Where Abyss Odyssey's combat makes up for it's lack of polish is in variety. The number of playable characters is surprisingly impressive, and while many are not as developed as others, they still help change up the combat occasionally.\n\nI was also pleasantly surprised by Abyss Odyssey's procedurally generated level design. While nothing groundbreaking, the levels it generates feel well constructed and reasonably different. While they still lack the same tightly focused nature of many hand-made levels, they serve as a good backdrop for the game's combat, even mixing in a bit of light platforming to break things up. Throughout these levels Abyss Odyssey offers the player many opportunities to make risk reward based choices which leverage immediate reward against the risk of long term peril. While a nice system, I rarely found any situations where the risks outweighed the benefits, effectively undermining the tension these systems could have created if they were more effectively balanced.\n\nAbyss Odyssey's most notable feature is its art and music. The environments on display are beautiful to look at and manage to help disguise the procedural generation. Character designs are especially good. Each one is reasonably interesting to look at. As a result, I always enjoyed seeing what creature I would stumble upon next. Abyss Odyssey's soundtrack is also fairly good, and manages to capture the mood of the game just right. I especially liked the eerie guitar pieces, which add to the unique atmosphere.\n\nDespite it's numerous flaws, I still believe I can give Abyss Odyssey a cautious recommendation. Anyone interested in a procedurally generated Beat 'em up will likely be satisfied, so long as they can overlook some frustrating design elements.","October 22, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/prototyke/recommended/255070/","prototyke","Prototyke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/prototyke/","442 products in account","Abyss Odyssey is a platform based fighting game with a bit of story, a randomized map, and a whole lot of crazy. A major facet of the game is that death is not the end; not necessarily even in each playthough. When the main character, one of either Katrien, a dead dude with hands but no body, or a sea goddess, dies, they are simply replaced by a soldier (still playable, of course) who can revive the main at certain alters. Only when the soldier dies must you restart. However, death only costs you your progress down and your current one items. Level, exp, and gold are kept.\nThis game has a special mechanic that adds one more layer in. The main can use a special skill and rip the soul from an enemy, gaining the ability to transform into any enemy, including all bosses. Dying as a monster turns you back to the main, adding another layer of life. Which you will need because the monsters are brutally unmercifully good at beating you to a pulp. The AI is intelligent and each monster knows its strengths. If a monster is fast but weak and you shield, it'll wait for a hard hitter to show up and they will tag-team you to death.\nThe story (for characters, primarily. There isnt much of a plot.) and art of the game are amazing. The story is that a powerful warlock is in a asleep in a coma or something, and his nightmares are materializing in the real world. As one of his dreams, you are trying to stop him. Characters and monster are primarily from old Chilean myth and folklore and also a considerable amount from the Christian bible, plus many from various other worldwide myths, all with the wonderful wackiness of ACE. Plus there is also a crossover character from Zeno Clash now.\n\n\nPros:\nGreat visuals, music and designs.\nEvery character/enemy is playable.\n\nEither way:\nDifficulty. The game is brutal. There is no easy mode or tutorial. Only hard or harder. I like that, but not everyone does.\nEnemies are really smart and know you, so you have to know and exploit them. Finding ways to successfully spam attacks is generally rewarded with not dying. You can do it, but so can the enemies, so it could go either way.\nAnimation cancelling is a major mechanic. This means that learning combos through hard trial and error is the best way and messing one up can mean a lost battle due to long animations. The mechanic is really cool though, so again, either way.\n\nCons:\nControls can be a tad floaty, but its not that bad.\nSoldiers cannot jump as high as other characters, and I am bad at getting places with them. This is far more fruatrating than it sounds.\n\n\nVerdict:\nExcellent game. I really enjoy(ed) it. If you've never played a fighting game, or don't like them, or you're really bad, then this isn't the game for you. However, it is excellent for those who are willing to climb its learning curve.\n\n\nNotes: This is my first review. My apologies if I've messed absolutely everything up and offended everyone in the general vicinity.\nAlso, my playtime is very inaccurate. I've played it offline most of the time. Supposedly the multiplayer is good, but I haven't bothered with it yet.","October 30, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All and all it feels out of place at first, but it's easy enough to get used to. Speaking of characters, the design of this game is unlike anything I've seen before; many of the monsters the player encounters are very interesting to look at, and often have eerie glowing or melting effects to them. This entire game really looks strange, yet at the same time great.\nOther than that this is just an RPG rougelite where dying sends you back to the start without your equipment, but leveling and cash stay with you after death. I'm not the biggest fan of procedurally-generated enviroments, but the dungeon this game takes place in is varied enough to keep my attention.\n\nIn the end I have to say that this really is a good game. My only real complaint is that attack inputs often feel wonky or unresponsive since you're probably not going to learn the attacks of all the characters you play as.\n\n\nAlso a lot of people are complaining about co-op and KB/M controls.\nDunno anything about these; I've been playing this game alone with a 360 controller","October 31, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let me take a moment to explain what I mean.\nWhen I read the game description for this game I was assuming that this might be a game like rough legacy with some special moves thrown in and maybe a simple counter system. Because of this I went into this game with a button mashing mindset. The first few floors went by easy enough. But soon enough I found myself fighting against what seemed to be godlike baddies. They were blocking all my moves and striking me with ease. And when there was multiple eneimes I would just get slaughtered by them. Over and over I died. Earning a bit of exp and gold with each run I figured this was just one of the nonsense grind to get good games. Once I leveled up a bit and bought some nice impressive shiny gear I figured I was going to clear the game no problem... and then I was beaten to death once more.\n\nTo be honest I was thinking about giving up on the game, but slowing down a bit and taking the time to really understand what moves do and how the position you around your enemies I started  to understand the flow of this games combat. And once I took the time to learn about the cancel ablities the game started to become much easier.\nSoon I did not care about gold or what gear I had. I was chaining my attacks and was destoying all in my path. I feel like you have total control in this game combat wise. You setup your fights, with how your use your abilities it almost seems like you can even controll the enemies movements. Combat is really rewarding in this game if you stick it out. And with three diffirent characters to try out you'll find someone with a playstill that is more comfortable for you to play with.\n\nThough that does bring me to one nagative point I have with the game. Once you get combat down you find out just how short this game is. Of course the game does give you replayability. Whether you choose to grind for more exp, gold to buy the best gear to become godlike yourself, or maybe trying to clear the game again with a new character you'll still have something to do.\n\nIn short don't look into this game if you are looking for a simple button mashing game. The game can be difficult and seem almost unforgiving, but if you are looking for a game with rewarding game play and don't mind the rougelite mechanic of this game (nothing to bad here, if you die you just have to start over from the top gearless) I would reccomend giving this game a try.","October 27, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mantisofparadise/recommended/255070/","mantisofparadise","ParadiseMantis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mantisofparadise/","281 products in account","A clunky fighter rogue-lite hybrid that, while decently fun despite he game handling like all your controller inputs were first translated by a monkey and then handed off the game developers who then decide whether or not your button press occurred or not, pretends to have much more depth on offer than it actually possesses. Collecting enemy souls isn't really that big of an appeal, they handle differently but each enemy type has one or two combos or moves that are just much better than the others and I find it difficult to want to invest time into learning how to handle this game knowing that my reward for high skill play is more monsters to learn.\n\nSince the only thing you keep are levels and levels don't offer a significant enough increase from level to level the game feels the same the first time you beat and every time after that. You'll be strategically choosing monster souls based on what is and isn't good or what you do and don't know how to play which doesn't really encourage learning new ones even if the game throws a bonus stage with a random monster at you after every boss (actually this can be more annoying than exciting, having to learn a whole new moveset to fight a mob or two is actually pretty frustrating even if there isn't an actual penalty for losing.)\n\nI want to like this game but the RPG and rogue-lite elements are limited, monster collecting doesn't appeal to me as it only serves to add a flimsy excuse to learn more about a game whose versus lobbies are deader than the extinct species list, and the storyline is only a bit interesting (less so when you realize you don't have any actual influence on it and reading about it doesn't actually give you any real benefit beyond a decently arranged story.) It's a decent game but it can only ever be decent when it is so riddled with flaws and the fact that the main menu contains an advertisement is just icing on the cake.\n\nI can't recommend this purchase, I like it but it isn't where it would have to be for me to say you should pick this one up. If you really want to learn a clunky fighting game system so you can fight the same 12-15 enemies over and over then go right ahead but I'm not going to be the guy encouraging you to do it.","November 18, 2015","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first it can seem pretty difficult, but it's a game that requires some level of mastery. The way the combat system works is very similar to Super Smash Bros. There are shields, rolls, grabs, air dodges, directional attacks and aerial directional attacks. It handles differently though. It might take some time to get used to it even if you are familiar with Smash Bros. The campaign mode is like a randomly generated metroidvania with varying paths, monsters and bosses. There are multiple playable characters with all different skills, weapons, and movesets. You can even capture and switch between playing as your current character and a monster. The only negative things I can say about this game is 1) grabbing ledges is awful. You have to be really specific about how you approach the ledge. In some situations this can cost you a lot of health. 2) Sometimes you can get overwhelmed and wrecked by a group of enemies and/or stage hazards. They'll combo you to death if they attack you at the same time and get the first hit off. 3) Unavoidable hazards. There are some hazards that seemed too long to jump over. At least I couldn't make it with a double jump and dash/airdodge. I had to jump in and get poisoned. That's all the issues worth mentioning though. It's really good overall.","November 4, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really like the art style in this game, it's brisk and unlike most things you see in modern games so it's also really fresh. Similarly I also really like the soundtrack; immersive and fits the theme, very well done.\n\nThe unfortunate point is that these two elements are the only things which I found good about the game. The controls aren't given in the story; you're just told what action to perform without guidance, nor is there any form of tutorial that I could find in the game (granted I didn't look that hard). To have any idea about what you have to do you need to navigate to the help & options screen via the main menu. However once you've learnt the basic movements and actions they still feel really clunky and isn't very fluid at all. I've got to say I was really let down when I got into the game because of poorly the movements of the player controlled character were made.\n\nTL;DR: Great artwork and sound track. Bad gameplay mechanics, feels like wasted potential.","November 7, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It focus on the Hero/Soldier duality, when the Hero dies then a Soldier comes to continue it's progress. You have a chance to revive the Hero at an Altar if you make it that far. The Soldiers are weaker but still capable on their own and provide an interesting gameplay ideia: you're forced to do with the Soldiers what you could not do with the Hero.\n\nThe art style is incredible, all characters including enemies are very well design and the environments fit well within the game. The combat is varied and allows you to choose between 3 Heros + 3 Soldiers + about 20 different monsters you can summon once in a while. Each one has its own style and unique special abilities.\n\nThe game is a bit difficult, to get to the final boss you have to pass through many levels with different difficulties and if both your Hero and Soldier dies you're back to square one. There are checkpoints along the way to save progress but these require tokens which are quite expensive. Any attempt to defeat the final boss is an expedition that requires preparation and nerves of steel.\n\nPros:\n- Amazing art style\n- 3 heros to choose + a bunch of other playable characters\n- Good combat\n- Random generated levels improve replayability\n- Made by the Zeno-Clash boys, guaranteed seal of Awesomeness\n\nCons:\n- Controls are a bit slugish\n- Better to play with Xbox controller\n- Being bum-rushed to death happens from time to time\n- Random generated levels end up being repetitive\n- Difficulty","October 25, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let me take a moment to explain what I mean.\nWhen I read the game description for this game I was assuming that this might be a game like rough legacy with some special moves thrown in and maybe a simple counter system. Because of this I went into this game with a button mashing mindset. The first few floors went by easy enough. But soon enough I found myself fighting against what seemed to be godlike baddies. They were blocking all my moves and striking me with ease. And when there was multiple eneimes I would just get slaughtered by them. Over and over I died. Earning a bit of exp and gold with each run I figured this was just one of the nonsense grind to get good games. Once I leveled up a bit and bought some nice impressive shiny gear I figured I was going to clear the game no problem... and then I was beaten to death once more.\n\nTo be honest I was thinking about giving up on the game, but slowing down a bit and taking the time to really understand what moves do and how the position you around your enemies I started  to understand the flow of this games combat. And once I took the time to learn about the cancel ablities the game started to become much easier.\nSoon I did not care about gold or what gear I had. I was chaining my attacks and was destoying all in my path. I feel like you have total control in this game combat wise. You setup your fights, with how your use your abilities it almost seems like you can even controll the enemies movements. Combat is really rewarding in this game if you stick it out. And with three diffirent characters to try out you'll find someone with a playstill that is more comfortable for you to play with.\n\nThough that does bring me to one nagative point I have with the game. Once you get combat down you find out just how short this game is. Of course the game does give you replayability. Whether you choose to grind for more exp, gold to buy the best gear to become godlike yourself, or maybe trying to clear the game again with a new character you'll still have something to do.\n\nIn short don't look into this game if you are looking for a simple button mashing game. The game can be difficult and seem almost unforgiving, but if you are looking for a game with rewarding game play and don't mind the rougelite mechanic of this game (nothing to bad here, if you die you just have to start over from the top gearless) I would reccomend giving this game a try.","October 27, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

BUT the gameplay is so step by step, the fluidity of the character is 0, it almost feels like the got some photos and place one after another, the muvetment is dam annoying when you have to jump from a platform to another, because (you can jump 1 more time while in the air) the second jump fells like he was implemented so players dont anoy themselfs if they cant change the direction while flying from the 1st jump(just  details, not important, but there are plenty and sadly not in the good way :\ )\nNow what I like about this game is the character sistem (actualy i ♥♥♥♥♥ hate that boar caracter, it just dont make any sense to play as a boar that looks like TripleH + Steroids and have those atacks that just apear as pictures, you know what i mean if you played SF 2), now if I imagine that boar wast there the character sistem is rly nice, it brings a little more diverity, even if the first 2 heroes have the same muve set and WOW GUES WHAT the first char throws a FIRE BALL {FORWARD}, o wait, what is that, the seond character WOW it can SHOOT a BULLET {FORWARD} Such unicity.\nI enjoied games like this and i still do : Ex1: Lost Saga Online (It's free, 3D,Better graphics,MUCH MORE AND UNIQUE HEROES indeed <3, the bad thing : bcs of no funds, after 3 years of gaming it shuts down and after 6 months it opens again by another .srl)\nEx2: Trine1,2,3 (It is a 2.5 like this but it has awesome gameplay and graphics, awesome to play with friends, it got some puzzels too, I highly recomand these one to be played with friends it's lot of fun for like 6h)\nThe CONCLUSION for Abyss Odyssey : NO!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/prototyke/recommended/255070/","prototyke","Prototyke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/prototyke/","442 products in account","Abyss Odyssey is a platform based fighting game with a bit of story, a randomized map, and a whole lot of crazy. A major facet of the game is that death is not the end; not necessarily even in each playthough. When the main character, one of either Katrien, a dead dude with hands but no body, or a sea goddess, dies, they are simply replaced by a soldier (still playable, of course) who can revive the main at certain alters. Only when the soldier dies must you restart. However, death only costs you your progress down and your current one items. Level, exp, and gold are kept.\nThis game has a special mechanic that adds one more layer in. The main can use a special skill and rip the soul from an enemy, gaining the ability to transform into any enemy, including all bosses. Dying as a monster turns you back to the main, adding another layer of life. Which you will need because the monsters are brutally unmercifully good at beating you to a pulp. The AI is intelligent and each monster knows its strengths. If a monster is fast but weak and you shield, it'll wait for a hard hitter to show up and they will tag-team you to death.\nThe story (for characters, primarily. There isnt much of a plot.) and art of the game are amazing. The story is that a powerful warlock is in a asleep in a coma or something, and his nightmares are materializing in the real world. As one of his dreams, you are trying to stop him. Characters and monster are primarily from old Chilean myth and folklore and also a considerable amount from the Christian bible, plus many from various other worldwide myths, all with the wonderful wackiness of ACE. Plus there is also a crossover character from Zeno Clash now.\n\n\nPros:\nGreat visuals, music and designs.\nEvery character/enemy is playable.\n\nEither way:\nDifficulty. The game is brutal. There is no easy mode or tutorial. Only hard or harder. I like that, but not everyone does.\nEnemies are really smart and know you, so you have to know and exploit them. Finding ways to successfully spam attacks is generally rewarded with not dying. You can do it, but so can the enemies, so it could go either way.\nAnimation cancelling is a major mechanic. This means that learning combos through hard trial and error is the best way and messing one up can mean a lost battle due to long animations. The mechanic is really cool though, so again, either way.\n\nCons:\nControls can be a tad floaty, but its not that bad.\nSoldiers cannot jump as high as other characters, and I am bad at getting places with them. This is far more fruatrating than it sounds.\n\n\nVerdict:\nExcellent game. I really enjoy(ed) it. If you've never played a fighting game, or don't like them, or you're really bad, then this isn't the game for you. However, it is excellent for those who are willing to climb its learning curve.\n\n\nNotes: This is my first review. My apologies if I've messed absolutely everything up and offended everyone in the general vicinity.\nAlso, my playtime is very inaccurate. I've played it offline most of the time. Supposedly the multiplayer is good, but I haven't bothered with it yet.","October 30, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first it can seem pretty difficult, but it's a game that requires some level of mastery. The way the combat system works is very similar to Super Smash Bros. There are shields, rolls, grabs, air dodges, directional attacks and aerial directional attacks. It handles differently though. It might take some time to get used to it even if you are familiar with Smash Bros. The campaign mode is like a randomly generated metroidvania with varying paths, monsters and bosses. There are multiple playable characters with all different skills, weapons, and movesets. You can even capture and switch between playing as your current character and a monster. The only negative things I can say about this game is 1) grabbing ledges is awful. You have to be really specific about how you approach the ledge. In some situations this can cost you a lot of health. 2) Sometimes you can get overwhelmed and wrecked by a group of enemies and/or stage hazards. They'll combo you to death if they attack you at the same time and get the first hit off. 3) Unavoidable hazards. There are some hazards that seemed too long to jump over. At least I couldn't make it with a double jump and dash/airdodge. I had to jump in and get poisoned. That's all the issues worth mentioning though.

Once you get used to the controls, the combat system feels quite satisfying. It has enough depth and encourages varying moves. You can perform special cancel to chain up combo, throw enemies who keep on guarding, do a 360 degree attack against those who get behind you etc. Overall, the fighting mechanism actually feels quite like something you'd expect in a fighting game.\n\nEach hero and other unit that you get to control has a unique move set. While some are arguably better than others (when playing as enemy units), They're still all interesting and fun to play as.\n\nCoop is also fun. I always embrace games that include the coop feature. If you have a friend who to play with you, definitely check this out.\n\nGameplay wise, this game has a lot of rogue-lite elements. Levels are procedurally generated, and they offer a unique experience for every playthrough. Everytime you die, you'd have to restart from the beginning. The entire dungeon has to be cleared in one go and there is no in-dungeon saving. Also, if you die, all the items you're carrying are also gone. However, you do get to keep your levels, gold, and unlocked abilities, so there is a persistent progression. Because of the randomly generated levels and the uniqueness of each character, this game is certainly worthy of multiple playthroughs.\n\nThe visuals are beautiful. Backgrounds have an unusal amount of details for any randomly generated level.\n\nHowever, there isn't a lot of story. the majority of the gameplay centers on combat and platforming with some exploration for hidden rooms and loot. A single playthrough is also relatively short, which is something i don't mind since i can replay it multiple times and still get a different experience in each playthrough. However, if you don't like replaying, then this might something you'd have to think about.\n\nThe game has a local versus mode, but puzzlingly it doesn't have online versus (but it does have online coop).\n\nOverall, the game is fun, especially if you have a friend to play it with. Even if not, it is still worth getting for the single player expereince because of the randomly generated levels, which add a lot of replay value.\n","November 4, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combat works just like in a fighting game, every character/enemy has a proper move set, but instead of just a one screen arena, you have to fight through a randomized dungeon with multiple floors and paths.\nThe game has around 40 characters, three of them are main characters with the ability to capture enemy souls. This is one of the key features of the game, because once you capture a soul you can use that enemy/boss in the game. There are some ballance issues with this though, some are near worthless some are op and this can impact versus mode.\nHowever it's not just a regular figthing game with platforming. The game has co-op and an inventory system, your main charactes can level up and gain skill points to strengthen moves they have found.\n\nSound/Music;\nMusic is excellent, sometimes reminds me of Castlevania, it creates a good atmosphere for the levels and characters. But it doesn't have any "God tier" songs that I would put on my mp3 player so it's "just" a 9 out of 10.\n\nGraphics;\nNothing extraordinary here, good dungeon prop variety and nice backgrounds makes the dungeons look good.\nBut that's it, doesn't look bad or particularly good, it serves it's purpose.\n\nArt desing;\nAbsolutely fantastic and very creative. The characters are very well designed, they are intersting, beautiful, creepy, terrifying. Things that look like a nightmare or a dream. (the game takes place in a nightmare) Levels are beautiful, and sometimes weird dream like. The menu is super cool.\n\nControls;\nOh my GOD the controls they seem bad, and they kinda are. But they aren't that bad once you figured out,  that you can actually climb over the ledges by pushing jump right next to them!!  You can also walljump which is completely useless and annoying. Blocking and dodging can get awkward too sometimes. Also might need X360ce for your controller to function.\n\nReplay value;\nRandomly generated dungeons with loot and secrets, every enemy has like a dozen moves not just 2 or 3 and you can play as enemies and bosses. With random encounters to keep things interesting. (some of them are pretty creative) It also has versus mode and co-op.","December 18, 2015","true","35.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Say, do you enjoy ATLUS games? Do you enjoy roguelikes? Well how about fighting games, surely you enjoy those. If the answer to any or all of these questions was a resounding yes then I have some great news for you! Abyss Odyssey is a game which manages to combine all of those things into one complete package - and then some!\n\nThis game has beautiful visuals, strong atmosphere and easy to get into yet hard to master gameplay. The combat has more in common with a fighting game than a simple side scrolling action RPG, there are several quick button combos and cancels that can be performed across each character giving all of the heroes (of which there are 3) a unique feel. The core game mechanic is that of the roguelike, you will enter into the randomly generated abyss and proceed up ways and down ways and sideways and the like, each section offering new peril and new reward. If you enjoy games that have a dark yet almost serene atmosphere about them I would say this is definitely one to pick up, the game does a great job with its varying environment types within the abyss and the subtle musical accompaniments contribute to that package.\n\nLike most roguelikes you can expect there to be a bit of a difficulty curve, items and levels will always be lost on death but your wealth will remain with you to make your next decent a bit easier. If you are on the fence about this one but you enjoy any of the things I mentioned above I would say go ahead and pick it up, it's worth it!","December 18, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My main complaint (which seems to be *the* complaint in general) is that the controls are a bit awkward. The combat took a little getting used to, but I got there in the end. Using the practice arena or the area before you select your entrance for the abyss helped me out. For some reason jumping is also oddly difficult, and looking at other reviews I'm glad to know it's not just me.\n\nThe replay value isn't the best (yet for some reason I personally find myself coming back to play more). Definitely give each character a shot though - I've found that I've enjoyed playing as Monk and Pincoya more than I've enjoyed playing as Katrien. Experiment with your special attacks and see what fits your personal style the best. It makes a massive difference.\n\nThe art in this game is truly amazing. My love for Art Nouveau became helplessly solid after playing this game! The music isn't bad, but sometimes I'm just not in the mood for it and I turn it down and play whatever else I want instead. The game alt+tabs with no worries, but the pause menu doesn't seem to be a pause in the expected sense, but when it pauses you can still take damage when you're in the middle of a fight. There are clever and interesting references to various mythology and other games throughout the game, and I didn't pick them all up straight away. It was nice to realise them later.\n\nI paid full price for this game and I don't feel ripped off. However, I know not everyone else feels the same way. I recommend the game, though. Ultimately it's a fun and beautiful game that I fell and love with and I keep coming back to, despite some of its flaws.","June 18, 2015","true","21.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The concept is full of promise, but the execution is lacking. The controlls are stiff and feel far too unresponsive for this kind of gameplay. The procedurally generated dungeon still manages to feel linear and never throws anything unexpected your way. After about an hour, the game feels more like a grind than exploration. A little more polish could have made this game exceptional.","June 5, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
