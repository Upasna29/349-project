It allows an alternative way to play this game with clever obstacles that require you to use them.  Trust me, if you play hard you would definitely use them pretty often.\n\nBoss Fight is a gem. Each of them requires a different set of way to defeat them and discovering how to do so is really rewarding.\n\nThe story is immersive and I really like the voice. It’s much better than the older trailers and without doubt, the art is amazing.\n\nWhat can be improved?\nFrame rate gets really unstable sometimes with steam overlay.\nMinor bugs can be found here and there\nLoad screen gets stuck occasionally.\n\nIf you are a beat-them up lover you should really try this out.\n\n#Also noted that it is their first release,  there are sure to be bugs around but I really like how responsive and active the developers are in dealing with them.\n","February 19, 2014","true","13.9"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","33","42","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/252430/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The single-plane side-scrolling beat-'em-up is alive and well. There aren't exactly a plethora of them, but the ones that are available are quite good, with Dragon's Crown, Dust: An Elysian Tale and Shank being some of the best in the field. It's not a crowded genre, so there's always room for an upstart to surprise people, and that's what PD Design Studio did with Dusty Revenge, its first major title for the PC.\n\nDusty Revenge is set in a mix between the Old West and Steampunk/Electrical Age populated by anthropomorphic animals. You play the role of Dusty, a bunny that wants to leave behind his tumultuous past and settle down on the farm with his love, Daisy. Things don't go as planned. One night, Dusty returns to find his farmhouse burning and the love of his life dead. Three shadowy figures leave him with a scar as they flee the crime scene. After regaining consciousness, Dusty sets out for revenge.\n\nThe story is simple in its setup and maintains that simplicity throughout, even if it sometimes gets a little heavy-handed. There are some expected story turns, such as allies teaming up with the hero because of their own agendas against a mastermind named Kraven. There aren't any twists in the tale, and the characters are one-dimensional. Story was never a big thing in this genre, and the game doesn't try to buck that trend. The story can get surprisingly dark, though. Despite the use of anthropomorphic animals in the cast, the plot can get quite gruesome, with blood splatter and characters' heads getting ripped off. It isn't extremely graphic, but the game isn't meant for kids, despite the appearance of the cast.\n\nDusty has three types of attacks that use different weapons. His light attacks use his fists and feet. Strong attacks utilize his scythe, which has slower execution but increased attack power and range. Distance attacks let him cause some damage with dual pistols or a shotgun. Both the light and strong attacks transition well into combos, which expand rather nicely when you level up. If you need extra help, you can call on one of your two compatriots. The big bear Rondel launches rockets to hit large mobs of enemies and break down touch barriers. The hound McCoy uses a sniper rifle to hit switches, free boxes from their cables and shoot down enemies.\n\nThe combat makes the game enjoyable. The flashy combos add some spark to the combat, and the somewhat uncomplicated system makes it easy for players to execute great-looking combos without learning difficult button sequences. Combos are air- and ground-based, giving the game a Devil May Cry flavor without resorting to 3-D. The game also does a good job of balancing platforming and fighting, and it even throws in some light puzzle aspects for good measure. Coupled with a good checkpoint system, adequate difficulty and a decent amount of gameplay, and you have the recipe for a game that is fun and worthwhile for genre fans.\n\nUnfortunately, the good, varied combat and interesting boss fights are dragged down by other elements. The combat shows some flaws when you use any of the assists. The automatic blocking doesn't always activate, resulting in some free hits for enemies. Foes also don't get hurt by their own ordnance, so you'll get shot out of your attacks. Some hitboxes are improperly aligned with the sprites to the point where attacks pass through an enemy without damaging him or her. The camera also has a tendency to not cooperate, since it's a bit dynamic instead of sticking you in the middle. This becomes problematic when platforming is introduced in the latter half of the game and the camera stays put instead of moving with you; you'll be forced to make blind leaps in order to progress.\n\nPerhaps the worst part of Dusty Revenge is the execution of the controls. While the light and heavy attacks are fine, shooting your guns isn't as smooth because both firearms are handled with the same button. Tapping the button makes you use your pistols while holding it down makes you use your shotgun. Far too often in the heat of combat, you'll shoot your pistols when you wanted to fire a shotgun blast, and vice versa. Opening chests is also annoying because a button needs to be held down for the action, and the accompanying animation makes the whole thing feel slow. You can also accidentally cancel the action by not holding down the button until the animation is complete.\n\nGraphically, Dusty Revenge is quite beautiful. The character sprites, while not exceptionally large, are very detailed. The scars on enemies, grimaces when someone gets hit, and the gritting of teeth when shooting a shotgun are all visible and look great. The animations are also quite smooth, with rarely a hitch during transitions. The backgrounds are also nicely detailed, and the use of a watercolor-style of cel-shading adds to the visual flair. There's a lack of any real particle effects, though. Smoke is rarely used, and even then, it looks simple when compared to the other visuals. Laser barriers simply fade instead of pulsate, making you think it's part of the background instead of something lethal, and downed barriers and platforms simply fall or fade away without any ceremony. When compared to the rest of the game, the lack of spectacular effects makes the title feel a little blander.\n\nUnlike the graphics, the sound doesn't fare quite as well. There are only two voices in the game, both of which only play during cut scenes. While Dusty's father sounds fine in his brief segment, Dusty lacks the expected emotion, considering the recent events in his life. He doesn't sound forced, but his inflections never change. It also doesn't help that he sounds like a gruff version of Jean-Claude Van Damme. The sound effects also vary wildly in their quality. While anything coming from Dante and friends sounds fine, enemy effects fall under three categories: they'll play fine, they'll play but lack any power behind the effect, or they'll simply go silent on certain actions. You get the feeling that the money ran out when they were working on the audio because explosions don't have the same punch as a shotgun blast, and sword slashes and machine gun fire are completely silent. On the bright side, even though the music doesn't match what's expected from a Western theme, it's rather good and is a nice accompaniment to the action.\n\nDusty Revenge has lots of potential and looks very eye-catching. The combat system is satisfying enough despite some cheap enemy tactics, and the boss fights are quite good. However, the camera/HUD issues and the limited use of sound is disappointing, and collision issues and bugs pop up occasionally. The varying quality on the controls can infuriate, especially during the platforming segments in the latter half of the game. For the price, the experience is still worth it but only if you've already played the better titles in the genre.","January 12","true","17.9"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","19","23","2","0"

I am yet to play this game for more than 15 mins without it crashing or glitching. Every now and then the enemies will just turn into white pixels, which can be a completely jarring experience. The combo system is intriguing as it allows you to air juggle, along with incorporate a number of different weapons in combat. However using the assist character isn't a fine tuned enough feature to use outside of the brief puzzle/platforming parts. The levels, background illustrations and character design are gorgeous and the steam punk feel is fresh and consistent, however sometimes hard to appreciate the manic action on screen. Speaking again on the combat, while it has its flashy moments, its not the most rewarding system. True it packs in a bunch of abilities such as dashing, side rolls, and dives, but battle range from simply pressing one button to beat the crap out of all on screen enemies, to furiously trying to dodge bullets and fight at the same time. I think this game has tons of potential, but it needs some serious updating to be worth it.","September 2, 2014","false","1.5"," 22 of 36 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","22","36","0","0"

It is very difficult to get certain combos out without mashing (which is something a polished character action game doesn't have), and the launchers tend to only work sometimes. I could see this being fun with two players, but the combat needs a serious rework before I could recommend it. It is fun when it cooperates, but after a few hours of play, it feels like you're fighting the controls and input lag more than the enemies themselves.

It seems not very professionally made.\n\nThe art style is very cool (sorta Shank meets TMNT) and I hope the game gets patched to work better but for now its unplayable for me. Maybe others are having a better experience.","February 17, 2014","false","0.6"," 24 of 55 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","24","55","0","0"

Other similar games have no trouble running on my computer, but this is a pretty big issue in my opinion. Doesn't help that there's input lag with the fps drops. It's a game with good potential if the technical difficulties didn't hold it back so much.","July 1, 2014","false","1.8"," 9 of 24 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","9","24","0","0"

Playing on easy and this thing beats us after watching playthroughs and whatnot. Very sad to not be able to finish the game, but throwing in 3 normal enemies that respawn with the second 'form' of the boss is really overkill. Sorry, because of that I can't recommend the game.\n\nForgot to mention: The health recharge that we saw in the walkthrough after defeating the first 'form' also didn't work for us. Hopefully it's just a bug...","April 13, 2014","false","4.2"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","7","22","0","3"
