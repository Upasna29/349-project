A mixture of a monster battler and a JRPG, but with the depth of a roguelike.\n\nIf you like complex RPG mechanics, then buy it. If you like satisfying progression, exploration and experimentation, then buy it. Support a fantastic developer who communicates with his playerbase, and make your monsters go and beat up other naughty monsters.

There's an exciting amount of potential, and exploration thereof is roundly encouraged by the constant stream of new options afforded to you. There are lots of questing options too to exercise such possibilities: besides the main story, there is base building and side quests and boss fights galore, all of which have a variety of incentives and possibilities for further shaping your party's development. The sense of potential is staggering, and encourages constant tweaking. It will take many hours and much exploration to have any sense of what is optimal or preferred. All this variety alleviates the potential grind. Siralim 2 is built to scale and challenge.\n\nThough in Early Access the game feels remarkably developed. A few bugs have cropped up, both in my playthrough and as I've seen on the forums, but there have already been multiple updates to address them, which has left me feeling confident that development and trouble shooting will continue apace.","May 27","true","22.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Some people build teams entirely made of tanks, others build full casters, some like a nice balance, I personally build my entire team around a single super creature and it all works, runs smoothly as far as graphics issues goes. The crashes happened a lot in the early hours, and have since slowed way down.

It does however offer much more complexity and customization when it comes to team composition than those older titles.\n\nBattles are turnbased and require you to think about what to do depending on what enemy creatures you face (their info is available by using inspect during battle, which does not consume a turn). Although enemies also have hidden bonuses, like stats and effects from artifacts they have equipped, making them less predictable and more varied.\n\nThe story is there, but it is not the main focus of the game. It works as both a tutorial of sorts through the game and includes unique boss encounters at certain floors.\n\nBoth spells (in the form of gems you can equip and de-equip form your creatures at will between battles) and attacks are viable options, although the gems you obtain from loot is random, so you might get lucky/unlucky.\n\n\n\nIf you played Siralim 1:\nYou can now adjust volume ingame (yey!). Seriously though, its better in every aspect, and if you liked the first one, you will love the sequel. If you did not enjoy the first game, you might still enjoy the sequel if the problems you had with the first game has been fixed by:\nThere is now floating combat text as opposed to everything being told through scrolling text at the top of the screen in the first game.\nEnemies no longer level up with you, so the difficulty of a certain floor is always the same.\n\n\n\nEnd notes:\nRemember that the game is still in early access for bug-squishing and balance-tweaking. As of writing this review most of the discovered gamebreaking bugs/crashes have already been fixed, so expect them to be few and far between in a couple of days (after this was written).","May 28","true","36.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

So, there's still some grinding, but it's the fun kind.  The spell gems themselves add so much to this game that it's an entirely different game.\n\nI get a Dragon Warrior Monsters vibe from this game, and that's definitely a good thing.

(staffs seem to increase attack and intelligence, whereas axes seem to increase attack and speed) there are also gloves, shields, and other armors that boost your defense and other resistances and there are even ribbons and necklaces and other accessories that boost intelligence or speed and other stats like that. all of the artifacts will endlessly (i think it's endless-i have some at level 1 and some as high as level 9) level up while equipped to a monster. as your rack up kills, you level up the artifacts.\nthis game is something i can see myself playing forever. an endless amount on endlessness. i wish i could more than recommend it.","June 4","true","48.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Daily updates. A dev who chats with the players during early access. Great music. And all the monster collecting you could want. Now lest talk about gameplay. On its surface this is a basic monster collecting and breeding game. You start off selecting your favorite critter from five choices. Each one is specialized in it own way, be it offense, defense, spellcasting, debuffing, or support. You will find all kinds of playstyles to choose from. Then you are sent off on your first quest; to kill some powerful monster summoned by a BBEG. Well along the way you will find more critters than you can shake a stick at and you will eventally fill your party with them. You can have up to 6 in your party at once and like I said before, each has its own thing that its good at, which can be further customized by equipping spells and artifacts. You want a tank that taunts enemies and every time he gets hit he places a DoT on the entire enemy team? go for it. Want a ninja that can dodge lightning and summons meteors every time he swings his sword? yep, you can do that too. Ok, ok, what about a dragon that resurrects allies whenever a spell is cast? you know it.\n\nUnlike other capture and breeding games in the genre, this time you can only evolve critters by breeding. You will come across breeding recipes along your journey. The downside is every time you breed or aquire a new type of monster, that creature can also show up in random battles. So while filling out your codex, the enemy list gets larger. At first you only fight about 8 types, but this list will quickly grow. There will be some where your party composition take easily and some not so much.\n\nTL;DR this is a mildly interesting game in early access. devs are receptive to their userbase. and the game should be checked out if you like the genre.","May 31","true","38.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It feels like they added in every feature they thought of: SMT-style monster fusion, Diablo-style equipment rerolls, light base-building elements, infinite dungeons, tons of achievements for hunters. Playstyles are surprisingly diverse, and most builds are viable--the skill system feels almost like a deck-building game in this regard. The graphics obviously aren't a priority, and gamers who hate repetition won't like the dungeon and quest format, but those of us in love with the earlier Final Fantasy/Dragon Quest/etc games need to give this a shot. No need to play the first game (this is super light on story).","May 30","true","30.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Much has been improved since the prior game, especially the spell system as each creature can now equip gems to cast spells based on their element type. This makes party configuration and customization miles better than the previous entry. Additionally, the reputation based systems add a compelling reason to revisit the different realm types, of which there are quite a ton. That, coupled with the new breeding system grants almost endless playability, as you can increase the "gene strength" of offspring giving them greater possible stats with each new generation. There are also many combinations that cause new "evolved" type creatures to be formed which combine two creature types.\n\nIn terms of criticism that could be leveraged against the game, I would say that the art and map generation are a bit lacking. The game reuses most (maybe all) the creature graphics from Siralim, but there are new ones included as well. This, I don't mind so much as it only means more content. However, I would have liked to see a change of tileset for Siralim, as the layout is more dynamic this time which is great, but the textures/feel of the city are the same as the previous game.\n\nThe game (as of now) is still only at version 0.1 in early access so much may change, but for those who haven't played the first game I would recommend to pick this game up as the content included already surpasses the first game and overall I find it way more fun to play than the first game.","June 5","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
