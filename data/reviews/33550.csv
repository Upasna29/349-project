While yes the four starting characters are a bit odd they make very little difference as to what you can achieve in this game. If you like being able to do whatever you want whenenver you want as a mage then this game is simply amazing. Want to be an evil Necromancer and go on a rampage in town turning the people you kill into mindless fodder then go right ahead. Want to be an Air mage calling down lightining on your foes then by all means do it. There are Twelve seperate schools of magic each with there own spells and passive's. Or you can go the way of the warrior and bash your foes heads in with a myriad of weapons. Plus the spells that you chose to specialize in change the way that your character looks and provide passive buffs and debuffs of their own.","March 4, 2014","true","16.8"," 38 of 38 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","38","38","0","0"

The graphics are outdated.  But the game has some really neat features.  You can kill anyone, including townspeople.  Leave area and hostility is gone.  Also your highest level spell in a category transforms a part of your characters body.  This means your character will be a hideously deformed freak.  This explains why they have such classic character choices as "the bakers wife" (a fat middle aged woman).  It is worth 20 bucks if you can dedicate the time to justify that price.  I paid 10 bucks.  Well worth it.","September 29, 2011","true","3.8"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

I like it and its open world even better. I do recommend using the tutorial to learn how to play it.","March 13, 2014","true","0.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/samnornal/recommended/33550/","samnornal","sam.nornal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/samnornal/","115 products in account","The greatest flaw with this game is the design of the gameworld. The very first area I was thrown into was wide and open...and completely barren. And I'm not just talking in terms of the appearance of the area, but of the design. Yes, there was a huge area for me to go around in, but that space was filled with nothing. Repeated textures for trees and dry bushes, random enemies with no rhyme or reason to their design were rampant, and I was left with the feeling I was walking around a huge chessboard, not the desert area I was supposedly wandering in.\n\nHeading to what I could only presume was the hub city, I was greeted with more of the same. The city was a wide open space, but still empty. What fills the world are either a combination of random swarms of enemies you combat with a subpar, unrealized magic system, and NPCs with mismatched voicework and little to no reason to care for them. This on top of the needlessly cluttered, unorganized spellbook make the game a chore, and all for little to no reward.\n\nMaybe the game gets better later. Maybe those first few areas are the black sheep and the world becomes alive and interesting later, and somehow the magic system starts functioning without being needlessly obtuse. But if just playing the tutorial and two starting areas make me as unexcited and eye-rollingly critical as this game's starting areas made me, I doubt the rest of it is worth it.\n\n","July 6, 2014","false","1.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

In this case they are so bad they actually detract from the experience. Absolutely atrocious. Games much older look a great deal better, Torchlight and Titan Quest pop to mind immediately. Time of Shadows cant even display correctly. In widescreen everything looks stretched and weird. In fullscreen everything looks squished and weird. Animations are horrible. Textures are chunky. The lighting is worse than Unreal and Quake 3.\n\nThe gameplay itself is rotten. Abilities are unimpressive and its difficult to fight thanks to poor controls. Too many useless idiots filling up the screen. Plot and storytelling are lousy. Dialog is lame. Audio is poor quality.\n\nStay away. Theres much better in the hack'n'slash genre. If you are super bored, go mow your lawn or take up flower arranging. This is just a waste of time.","January 24, 2015","false","0.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","2","5","2","0"

It's like a cheap, broken version of diablo. I honestly don't really mind some of the wierd textures and bad voice acting too much, and honestly, I had fun playing this game. For ten dollars (or free in my case) it's not too bad. If you want the game (unless you're sitting on fat stacks of cash) you should probably wait for a steam sale because though it  is interesting enough to play, it's definatly not something you would absolutly need  in your steam library right away. Also no trading cards...","December 18, 2014","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
