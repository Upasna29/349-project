It has linear plot, pretty graphics (although it isn't perfect). There is no mature content, it's definitely suitable for all ages. 3 hours is enough to complete it on hard difficulty with no hints whatsoever.\n\nDon't expect very original plot or puzzles. It's just a decent, relaxing, definitely casual, short game.\n\nGRAPHICS: 7/10\nAUDIO: 6/10\nGAMEPLAY: 7/10\nSTORY: 5/10","April 6","true","3.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

You've Played Them All! This One!!\n\nThis entertained me and I finished the complete story; for that reason alone I have to rate this positive. The game overall is pretty mediocre to the core. There must be a hidden object template out there where you simply insert your own content; or at least that's what it seems like. The storyline is pretty weak, graphics are average but the hidden object elements were nicely done and that's why I really play these games.\n\nYou play as a mother who must scour the land in search of your kidnapped daughter. You will make your way through tons of maps, puzzles, hidden object games and more. Will you have the wit and resolve to defeat the Soul Reaver and save your daughter from the clutches of evil?\n\nWorth about $3; I wouldn't pay more than $1/hr for average gameplay!\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaotia/recommended/428250/","kaotia","Kaotia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaotia/","310 products in account","Short Hidden Object Game about a mother trying to save her daughter from an evil spirit. There isn't a map, you'll have to solve the puzzles and HO scenes of each location to proceed, so no backtracking. Graphics are nice, the entire game has a slightly "horror" setting and this is a good change from most HOGs on Steam, unfortunately the cutscenes and the few dialogues are nothing special. Achievements are in-game only, 4 difficulty settings, sadly there isn't a bonus chapter or other extras like similar games but I still recommend this one, especially if you find it on sale (I got it with a bundle).","March 30","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
