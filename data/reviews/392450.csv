The only thing I did notice is you do have to be positioned in the correct spot in order to collect things such as blood samples. For example, say you walk up to a blood splatter on the ground. If you're on the left of the pile of blood and use the spacebar or enter button to interact with the object, nothing will happen. However, if you're standing in front of the pool of blood then use the interaction buttons, you'll collect the sample. This is minor but could still be improved.\n\n*Sound: 8/10\nI couldn't tell if there was background music or not because it was so faint! The sound for entering and leaving buildings was weird and when dialog took place no one talked. It was all reading. There is a point in the game you have to listen to a recording, this part the voice actor did a nice job and I liked that you could read along to what he was saying.\n\n*Hours to complete: 8/10\nI beat chapter one within 44 minutes. I did have to listen to the sheriff's recording again though (which you can't skip unfortunately) and that's about 2-3 minutes long. So if you don't make that mistake you can easily beat it within 40 minutes. I gave it an 8/10 score only because I wish it was a little longer! I really enjoyed playing it and I'm not sure when the next chapter will be released!\n\n*Story Line: 10/10\nYou play as two detectives from out of state and travel to Silver Creek Falls (which is a real place, btw) to learn about a recent mystery case that has troubled the local police department. You must investigate 3 different crime scenes to help unfold the mystery located in this small town.\n\n*Game Play: 10/10\nI had such a fun time playing this game. I love 2D pixel games. It reminds me of my childhood. From the moment I started playing, I was intrigued and entertained. My inner detective was constantly trying to figure out what could have happened to this town. Before you play there is a note in the beginning to let you know to keep your eyes out for anything that could be used for evidence. This actually did help me because I literally checked every room, locker, shelf, etc I could and found things that could have been easily missed. I collected every blood sample (43 total, which is one of the steam achievements. The other is to drink one of the blood samples) and any other evidence I could find. At the very end of the game I never suspected what happened and I'm still very confused because even the cliff hanger didn't give any information and left me with more questions! I want more of this game!!\n\n*Price: 10/10\nThe best part: as of right now, the game is free to play!! I would easily pay up to $10 for this game with more chapters being available and/or being released quickly. So get it while you can!\n\n*Overall:\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes:\n>2D pixel games\n>Detective/mystery games\n>Short, casual games\n>Chapter/story games\n\n**Note: This review was made for CHAPTER ONE.","August 16, 2015","true","1.8"," 62 of 70 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","62","70","4","2"

A mystery game with a potentially interesting Chapter 2, the end of Chapter 1 has an interesting cliffhanger.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, it's a little buggy, but mostly it's "search everything".  No combat at all (and due to the nature of the game there probably won't be any).  If you like a story, this game seems like it has potential.\n\nMy only real gripe is that it starts off fairly slow and there's some cutscenes where you can't skip at all (in case you accidentally interact with it again).  I can also tell that going over every pixel for a clue will be frustrating.  Maybe if this game was done as a visual novel or maybe a point and click adventure using AGS instead of RPG Maker would've probably made this game feel less grindy and more intriguing.\n\nI'll put this at recommend because the story potentially sounds great, but the gameplay is slow and tedious.","August 12, 2015","true","1.0"," 40 of 45 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","40","45","0","0"

It'll take you in and around 40 minutes to an hour to finish the game, it's short, and story driven.     The first part in a three part series, this one starts the story, and a very good start to say the least.\n\nThe price...  free..  free always works for me.  You lose nothing by trying it out..\n\nI'd recommend this game as it doesn't require much of any time investment, it's simplistic, free, and best of all interesting.\n\nThe Story...  seems to be inspired by movies like Twin Peaks, or games like Deadly Premonition.\n\nIt's not scary, or overly complicated atleast not yet.  The bones are there for a interesting story to be laid out, it's just a matter of how good the developer will keep the story moving forward.  Like all great mysteries not much is revealed in the first part.\n\nThe gameplay..  Is your typical RPG maker fair, move around with either the K&M or plug in your controller and kick back..  The gameplay  consist of you finding items in three crime scenes,, the items all lay in plain sight and no real puzzles exist just yet..  A few items you're required to pick up have no use just yet...\n\nI'd recommend playing this one, if enough people download load and play hopefully the developer will finish up the three part series and the remainder of the story will be revealed...","August 30, 2015","true","0.9"," 35 of 37 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","35","37","2","0"

There's no combat, just clue searching & dialogues that advance the story, but the story is the best part.\nEven though it was over way too fast for my liking, i thought that it was a really good intro, to what might end up being a very cool story.\nI'm definately keen to see what happens next.\n\nIt took me almost 2hrs (i do pause quite a bit) to finish, & that included getting the 2 Achievements.\nIt's a RPGMaker game, so that should give you an idea of the graphics style. The Back Ground Music was (from what i could tell) mostly mellow piano playing, that was fitting for the story & setting.\n\nYou should definately try this game. I can't really think of a reason not to. It's free. It's a small download. It's an easy Perfect Game (100% Achevo's). And it's actually good.\nHave fun.","September 5, 2015","true","1.9"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/392450/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","Silver Creek Falls - Chapter 1 is a free-to-play game, destined to promote the two next episodes. However, there is a DLC that you can buy, which is the soundtrack. You know how Steam is working with F2P or free games: once uninstalled, they're not showing in your library anymore. The only way to keep them listed is to buy a DLC - many F2P propose packages, soundtracks or extras. I've bought the DLC, only to keep it in my library. But it's not a useless purchase: I loved the soundtrack.\n\nYou're Sara Fitzgerald, a detective partnered with a foreign man, sent to Silver Creek Falls to investigate a series of bloody murders. However, what you will find there is bigger than the simple result of a serial killer.\n\nThe plot is interesting and is meant to be expanded in the next games. I'm in the middle of the second chapter and the third one is being released at the end of March 2016. Right now, the story is holding up its promise.\n\nThe game is also using RPG Maker, however, it's an adventure game, so, you have nothing to upgrade or to level up. The controls are good but I got an hard time to get used to them, mainly with the inventory. I missed a tutorial in the game. Compared to Space Pilgrim, it was less intuitive.\n\nThe fact that it's a RPG Maker game didn't bother me, I found the graphics very acceptable, besides, given the fact that the first chapter is bloody, you're not going to find any fairy tale. However, the achievements coming with the game is very explicit: find all blood samples and drink one of them... I don't know if there is a link to vampires but it's sure saying something: you're not here to have cute characters, cute crime scenes or a cute world. The game is set in our modern era, so, don't expect futuristic buildings or castles... Expect houses, warehouses or streets that are very common.\n\nI would say that given the fact that the game took only a half-hour to be beaten, it's nice to have released as a free game. However, after some thinking, I wouldn't have minded to spend 1 euro/dollar on it, just to support the developers. It wouldn't hurt at all. However, as they've released the soundtrack, I've given that euro/dollar to them by buying it.\n\nSilver Creek Falls is a promising game. I mean by that that the next chapters should be interesting - I can say that the second chapter is quite intriguing. As for chapter three, it's "Wait and See" as it will be released soon. Given the fact that the game is free, it's not hurting anyone to try it.\n\nBy the way, if you're familiar with Rizzoli and Isles and The Legend of Korra, don't you think that Sara has the look of Kuvira and behaving a little like Jane?","August 13, 2015","true","1.5"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","13","17","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/392450/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4393 products in account","TL;DR: The first chapter of an investigation and mystery game saga promises an intriguing story line but lacks in its potentially coolest features.\n\nRPGMaker game that is not an RPG, Silver Creek Falls puts you in the shoes of two police detectives who are presented with a case of ominous disappearances at the small town of Silver Creek Falls. I will try to keep this spoiler-free for the important bits, because the story is so short for the time being. Note that only chapters 1 and 2 are out. The third and last one will come in 2016.\n\nThe case presented is indeed ominous: large pools of blood are found at the scenes with no bodies to be found. What's going on? It's for your pair of investigators to find out. There are hints of occultism, secret societies and a shroud of mystery around the case. Gameplay consists of looking for evidence at the crime scenes and a couple of times you need to make minor deductions based on the evidence.\n\nThe deductions part could have been so much better executed. You are presented with a multiple-choice questions and got to choose the right answer based on the evidence. However, guessing wrong is not penalized, instead you get to try another answer right away. Being right straight on is not rewarded in any way either, rendering these deductions dull. It would have been cool if you were to chase the wrong lead for a few minutes: done right it could have sparked an additional story arc or at least a source of humour. Think about it: the investigators going to a café instead of the right scene, enjoying a coffee and finally realizing that "Nope, there's no clues here. Where to next?" and then resume the story.\n\nAlso, the beginning lets you think that you should keep a keen eye at crime scenes but there's no actual deduction similar to e.g. Murdered: Soul Suspect or Contradiction: Spot the Liar required. That would have been cool. Now it plays more like an interactive novel: find all the evidence and see the next set of dialogue.\n\nDialogue between the investigators and the local deputy is perhaps the strongest part of the game in addition to the storyline. Of the investigators, headstrong and impatient Sara is a nice contrast to the calm and patient Philip. They will discuss the evidence when found and offer remarks as to its significance. This has been done very well, as is the soundtrack and graphics, which fit the theme splendidly. The soundtrack manages to capture the mystery theme excellently. There's also one cutscene with voice-over, which was really cool.\n\nYou also have a map of the town that you can look at any time but it's not really used for anything useful. The town is empty of any people or other activity whatsoever, like a proper ghost town. Perhaps it's because of it being a really small town but it frankly looks just unfinished in that respect.\n\nYou should note that others have experienced game-breaking bugs of various kinds: I was lucky enough to have a smooth playthrough. Just be sure to save every now and then to avoid them.\n\nStory lasts a mere hour and closes in on a cliffhanger that leaves you wanting for more. It's a thrilling story and it's even free, so if at all you like mystery games do give it a try! Despite their initial kickstarter to produce Chapter 2 it has now been released, Chapter 3 supposedly coming in 2016.\n\nEDIT: New information on the release date of mid to late September added to the very end.\nEDIT 2: Chapter 2 is scheduled to be released on September 30th.\nEDIT 3: Chapter 2 has been released. I made a couple of small updates to the beginning and end of the text.","August 23, 2015","true","1.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","2"

The atmosphere is as thick as a RPG Maker Game can be, and it seems to be well thought through.

So far so every story ever.

I can't wait for Chapter 2 to come out!\n\nThanks, BeechKa-at\n\n( P.S.

The story is interesting, the dialogue is well written, the characters are multi-dimensional, the graphics are nice, and there's more to interact with than in most of these games. The music is beyond phenomenal and the little bit of voice acting is well done, maybe not the best, but better than average.\n\nI only have three real complaints with the game.  The first is that you can re-trigger interactions with items and sometimes that leads to lengthy dialogues being repeated.  It would have been nice to have a second dialogue trigger after the initial examination for these longer exchanges.  My second complaint is that this game plays in a rather small window and I couldn't find an option to set it to fullscreen.  My third is that there isn't a WASD movement option and it's awkward for me to use the arrows.","May 7","true","1.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abbydonprime/recommended/392450/","abbydonprime","AbbydonPrime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abbydonprime/","515 products in account","It's tough to recommend this. It seems to serve as bait to get people to buy the other 2 chapters. They could've just as easy made it one complete game. I've seen massive RPGMaker games going for less than $5. To get the other 2 chapters of this story, it would cost $9.98. That's a bit much.\n\nUnlike many of the other RPGMaker games, this one strays from the typical [J|A|C]RPG storylines and goes with a crime/investigation mystery story. It's fairly predictible most of the time, but that's okay. The genre tends to be that way for the most part unless the writer happens to be really good with setting up mysteries.\n\nI haven't played the other 2, so I can't speak for the series as a whole, but this chapter is extremely linear. The map is very small, and each scene is limited. The only actions available are collecting things, examining prop items, talking to NPCs when required to continue, and entering/exiting a scene. They all must be followed in a given order. The characters aren't all that special, either.\n\nThe only reason it would take more than 15-30 minutes to complete is because of the extra fluff dialog, such as the history of the park. Or, in my case, you miss some things needed for the Dracula achievement, so the first scenes would need to be played again.\n\nWith all of this, I'm still recommending it.\nIt's free. I wishlisted the other 2 chapters for when they go on a steep sale in order for me to continue the story.\nEasy achievements. For completionists like me, this is a good thing.\nIt's not just another JRPG. It doesn't even come close to being awesome like To The Moon, but it does bring something different to RPGMaker.\nIt's short. Yes, that's a plus in my book.\nSo, for it being free and short, you may as well give it a go if you have any interest in light mystery stories.\n\n---\n\nFor more...

Very short though, I'd like to play the other parts, but I'm not sure they're finished yet. Like the music, atmosphere, story, and you can't go wrong with the classic JRPG pixel sprite style graphics.\n\nThe thing I disliked about the game was the audio file of the sheriff's tape. The voice acting was pretty terrible, and I felt it would've been better as just more text that you read and imagine the voice yourself, just like when all the characters are speaking. I also feel it went a little overboard with information. Many of the things the tape said were things that a player 'should' have already known if they were paying attention to all the details of the game, and some of the things the sheriff said on his tape were almost cringe-worthy because they didn't leave enough of it up to the player's imagination. Short and sweet, slight hint drops, and no audio file with crappy voice acting. That would improve this a lot.\n\nEither way, I'd like to finish the other parts!","October 15, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Investigation here basically involves examining and collecting blood at three different crime scenes as well as picking up any items littered throughout. It's all very minimal and arguably more focused on story over gameplay. Between that and its old school, top down, RPG aesthetics, it reminds me a lot of To the Moon, though without that particular masterpiece's nuance for a well-crafted and touching story.\n\nI'd review this game positively, not because I'd necessarily recommend it exactly, but more because, while I personally found it largely forgettable and mostly a non-event, it feels pretty clear that it was made with sincere intent that means well and wants to pay respect and homage to the inspirations that informed it. That and because, being free, there's nothing to lose by anyone interested in it who has an hour to kill. Though I would warn that there are some aspects that may potentially bother, like the fact it can only be played in a very small window with no options to adjust anything, and the only controls of any meaningful use are the arrows keys to move and the Enter key to examine or use items.\n\nGiven that it has "Chapter 1" in its title it should come as no surprise that a follow-up is also available, and by the end of the game I very much felt like this is serving as a teaser to try and entice people in to purchase the second part more than anything else. To be honest, nothing about it grabbed me that much though, so unless it was on sale at a large discount I wouldn't be too concerned with making that purchase myself and finding out what happens next.

Who says 'Cool!' when asked to investigate a crime scene?\n\nThe voice acted bit was...Hm. Well, the accent was far too 'Southern Belle' when it should have been more 'Decorated Lawman'. I was honestly reminded of Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal of Clay Shaw in 1991's JFK. While Jones' performance was stellar...the accent does NOT fit this kind of character. Also, I find if difficult to believe that the Sheriff would leave a cryptic sounding note for HIMSELF. If it were re-worded to be intentionally listened to by a third party from the beginning instead of at the tail end it would have been easier to suspend disbelief.\n\nAlso, there are far too many contradictions to the story to be believable. You have a Sheriff who takes detailed notes on the crime scene, photos, etc...but leaves key pieces of evidence at the scenes? A deputy who didn't bother to even gather evidence because 'we don't have the facilities?'\n\nI dunno...there's a lot of potential, and FREE is a nice price, but the continuity and plot errors of the game are glaring, and in a story-heavy game that's almost unforgivable. Also...Sara or Sarah. PICK ONE.\n\n\nTLDR: I'm recommending it, hesitantly, and only because it is free. It's a decent story game, but the plot hiccups and continuity errors are enough to sour your taste.

You bet I'm in! This game is a simple little story driven detective game, with a solid UI. Although  the pixel hunt on the 2D background can make finding bits of key evidence kinda tricky. The few minor problems are the written dialogue seems rather wooden and not howtwo humans would converse. Second is the tape recording you listen too, the voice acting isn't 100% (sorry but it's true) with a almost comical accent. And the biggest issue is there is  no skip dialogue button if you accidentally interact with somethin/body again (TIP dont touch the car again after listening to the tape once). All in all the fit and finish is good and there is a good attention to details. The story is where it shines, i found by the end of the chapter i was fully engrosed and was left on a titilating cliff hanger.

Though take note, that this is only part of a story, it doesn't have any closure.\n+ The plot gets somewhat interesting by the end, too bad only the 1st episode is free to play :P Smart business model! Luring in the players with f2p achievements :D\n\nCons:\n- That voiced recording is more funny than anything else. The guy sounds bored and his accent overacted. That said, it's a nice touch to have some voiceover in an RPGMaker game. The photo background of that scene was a bit weird too. I get that the guy is a photographer, but it's such a sharp contrast to the visual style of the rest of the game.\n- When I tried to take a Steam screenshot, the game exited to the title menu, losing my unsaved progress ToT","November 22, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

As you can see, it is an RPG Maker project, though the game obviously not an RPG, but rather a visual novel, the first chapter of it.\nFor now, all you can get from it is an easy full completion game, hence there are only two achievements, of point-and-click nature, one hour of your time at worst. For the real game... guess we should wait for other chapters to be released. Were it me, I'd made all that in one piece, but perhaps authors wants a feed-back before a full release?\nWell, here's mine: guys, you're doing good.

Basically nothing happens til the very end of the game, in the last 10 minutes I'd say, which in my opinion is not enough for a 1hr and a half long-playing game. All you do is hanging around collecting evidence.\n\n\nI would recommend the developer to improve the dialogue quality (which are fundamental in a thriller/horror story based on clues like this one) as well as other voice recorded stuff: the tape recording acting was awkward. I also experienced some sort of slow response when changing direction with arrow keys, and when I first saved I wasn't able to open the saved game - this didn't happen the second time I saved game for testing.","September 15, 2015","false","1.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shaide/recommended/392450/","shaide","GaNoo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shaide/","1883 products in account","This RPGmaker serves as the first chapter/teaser for an ongoing game. One thing to keep in mind, is this is an RPGMaker game, so expect your standard birds eye view, cutesy 16 bit style anime graphics and over sized headed characters. If you enjoy those aspects then yer set! Otherwise beware!\n\nThe game so far has been getting rave user reviews, however I am mildly disappointed..and I will tell you why!\n\nFirst, the game has no guidance. I while playing the game first investegated 1 of the 3 crime scenes. After looking around a bit, it didn't tell me what else to do. The car wasn't allowing me to enter it. So, I remembered a sentence used by the deputy that neighbors had called the police the night of the murder. So, I assumed I would check in with the neighbors!\n\nNone of the neighbor doors were interactive so i tried the ones across the street. One let me enter, and inside was a tape, that essentially ended day one, and and assumed I had visited crime scenes 2 and 3...which I obviously hadn't! At first I thought "Well, maybe there wasn't a crime scene 2/3 even though the NPCs were talking about evidence that I hadn't encountered or seen. However, when checking the store front page for the game, in the screenshots area are screen captures of 2 crime scenes I didn't see....so...it's a safe assumption that I accidentally skipped them.\n\nThe story seems disconjointed, however that COULD be because it let's you skip through a big chunk of the game(Seriously dev, you REALLY need to patch that and change the police station to a seperate instance that doesn't phase in until after certain objectives have been met, or at least at some guideance like "Ok, well....crime scene 2 is north of here, let's check that out next".\n\nThere is no combat in the game, at least in the chunks that I played, however the type of game isn't really a combat game. It's less RPG and more story driven adventure.\n\nWill I buy any future chapters? Not if this is any indication what the future chapters will be like. The story seemed interesting, but the skipping two crime scenes thing? That's a major flaw in my opinion, and is something that SHOULD have been prevented, and could have been with a little extra elbow grease.\n\nYes, I know it's free...and for a free game it's ok, however I am assuming future chapters will cost $$$ and like I said, if this is the amount of effort the devs going to put into them as well? I'll pass.\n\nProsInteresting Story\nAt least one scene with voice acting.\nCute 16-bit graphics\nIt's free! DUH!\nDecent controls for a KB game.ConsBugged! Can skip half the game.\nBad BAD voice acting. Not sure if sheriff is southern or from new orleans..or somewhere else.\nNo controller support.\nNo way to go full screen(That I saw?)\nRATING: 3.5/10","August 16, 2015","false","0.6"," 11 of 26 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","11","26","0","2"

Blood all over the place.\nFirst thing I found was a Ouija board... who doesn't have one of those right?\nDid I mention there was blood? Good, cause you can start to collect it all... 22 pieces total(if I got em all).\nThe deputy tells you there were 4 girls living there but 5 went missing... (how would he know that that missing person was also there, right?)\nThe biggest mistake the creator made was; leaving a note in a room saying that there were 6 girls, not 5... how did the deputy not see this? He even mentioned they swept the place once and took some pictures.\nWell all riddles aside, the next crime scene one of the main characters just takes out his gun, starts shooting, the other main character asks "What made you shoot like that out of nowhere?" and he replies "I just saw something looking at us from that bush" and that's the end of it... no further questions asked!\nAt least, after about 10 minutes, you do know that the Red Sox played last night, that Norfolk is closer to the crime scene than Dunham and that the Sheriff was once invited to an important persons party...\n\nTL;DR\nToo simple for my likings, picking up 22 blood samples from a murder scene is not realy the game I'm looking for.\n\nBut it's free so that's a plus.","August 12, 2015","false","0.2"," 6 of 25 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","6","25","0","0"

Mostly I've collected clues & samples and listened to stories from he other police officer about the town, victims and so on.  I love it a lot right now.  I really hope that this encourages other RPG Maker creators to bring their Horror/Mystery games onto Steam as this one is fantastic and very fun to play through so far.  I would love to see a growing trend of this as RPG Maker games are some of my all-time favorite.\n\n*************POSSIBLE SPOILER*************\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have to point out though, the voice acting work on the video tapes kind of hurt the atmosphere for me.  I'm not going to say the voice acting was bad or anything like that and I am not trying to, either.  But it just sort of halted the pace and took away from the feel of the game up to that point.\n\nAlso, it would be nice if there was some indication telling you if you had collected all the clues from the scenes, just so you know.  I was looking all over the place, unsure if I had finished them (not wanting to leave anything out at all, of course) so having the game leet you know when you had collected everything for sure, would be a nice touch.","August 31, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is at this point in fact entirely prelude. Thats not bad, and while the games giving off something of a twin peaks vibe, and the dialog reads a bit rough here and there... I really can't say how the rest of the series will break good or ill. What I can say is its not terrible.. but its not really standing out. Well for me.... I played a lot of wierd RPG maker games in a similar vien. I can say its better then I've seen in a bit. So for this one... I'm recomending if you don't mind running about looking for stuff and trying ot peace things together. Its simple its short.

Surprisngly, I found myself wrapped up in it. Recommend it if you're looking for something short and sweet. It might lead you to go look for the other chapters.","May 22","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
