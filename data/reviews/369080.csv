The dev Jason aka Seattletek is rude and bans anyone at the drop of a hat for scolding this so called "game" *Cough. He has also purchased MOST of the positive reviews for this game, they all have the devs on their friends list. A few of them have even admitted they got the game for free and I can provide screenshots for proof. They also admitted the game is not worth it at this state and a rip off, what you are looking at is a game that has been in the making for 2 years! With 2 devs that have 7 hours gameplay put together. The graphics on the store page are not even the gameplay graphics, the real graphics (you can watch in a review) are about 1/10 of what the store displays. I purchased this game just so I could write the review to help warn people of this scam. I was banned from the discussions for saying the sound/game/animations looked bad. People aslo mention in the threads that the dev bans/reports/locks anykind of negative response to help the game sell. There are more placeholders than gameplay, this game will be EA forever and at $19 is just a joke on its best day. Do not listen to anyone defending this game because they got a free copy from the dev or are a tester/friend.Save your money because in 2 months this game will be dead, im kinda wasting time writing this as is because its going nowhere and thinking your money will "support" the game...It wont, its already set sail for fail. The animations/sound is just something that will make you cringe, THIS IS A SCAM! THEY ARE STEALING FROM YOU! For $19! ( they are not thinking right) you can buy miscreated, h1z1, day z mod. Anything really is better than what you are getting here. In 13 days I will get my money back, All this just to try to save people from getting ripped off. P.S devs if you want people to support this awful thing you should have done a gofundme because steam is a place for games, not a way to release a engine with a couple alterations to raise money for something that should already be in the grave. BUYER BEWARE! P.P.S The 5 minutes I had to put in before I could write a review was the worst experience of my life. I jumped on top of alligator and all it did was walk in circles and moan. What are you guys trying to pull? honestly? Also wanted to mention it runs bad but like you should care anyways?  GTX780TI i74930 32GRip Ram x79extreme11 MB. If I cant get above 30 frames I cant imagine what other people are getting. MY REVIEW BURRIED THIS IN THE MOSTLY NEGATIVE ZONE! SEATTLETEK U MAD? (Everyone needs to report this game on the steam page for being the scam that it clearly is.)  8/31/2015 they have a upcoming patch that has "working ai" as one of the things in the patch! Banjo Kazooie came out May 31, 1998. The alligators in that game had aggro and chased you/attacked you. Im just saying.... If my review stays in the direction its going I may have to just take the bullet for gamers everywhere and keep the game for the review to continue helping people be aware. Its something i really really dont want to do because I will be in a way supporting thieves but everyone seems to find the review helpful so I just may. Update 9/1/2015 The dev "Jason" commented on a discussion "This post is still here is it not? Well, then, end of story." Because 1 post didn't get deleted that means the people I see in the comments all the time for getting banned or post removed are just lying? How can you be that snarky and lie with a game this bad? I'm honestly trying to help you here, you CAN'T AFFORD any more bad rep for this game thats already looking pretty grim. How does it feel to know people have screenshots that prove you are lying yet you continue to try to remove all the bad rep? Why do the legit positive reviews say the game is broken and expensive yet give it a thumbs up? I just dont get it but I can't say anything else to help people from this point. If you read this and think well maybe he's wrong and buy the game and feel regret 5 minutes in just remember I tried my very best to help you and i'm truly sorry I failed you.\n\nToday is the 1st! The game goes full price now. As you all know at $19 lol, I just wanted to thank everyone for all the support, research, and work they have done to make the steam community better. We have educated over 800 people and prevented $13,900 from going to devs who think they can be rude, ban/censor happy, all while putting little effort in this game to get free money. Much love!\n\nUpdate 9/1/2015.  Two more positive reviews just came up on the store page, "TFoxxer" "SurvivalHorrorTV" (LOL THE DEVS ACCOUNT) - Seen this review and changed it to Jesus, Adult III epq - You would never guess. IT'S THE DEV TRYING TO SELL THE GAME "SurvivalHorrorTV" IS HIS YOUTUBE ACCOUNT! NICE TRY! The other has the devs on his list. This is your perfect chance for front row proof. If you try to look at the profiles and they are private now that means they have seen this and tried to cover more tracks. The devs will go to any extent to make a dollar and it's getting more obvious by the day. One of the devs has 60+ hours on the phantom pain, it's been out 4 days. Guess the hours in age of survival? Give up? 7 hours. Save your money this game is going nowhere.\n\nUpdate 9/4/15 Programmer stops showing up to work on the game. People need to wake up and see this game is going nowhere, don't believe me? Go check on the devs post in the bugs thread.\n\nUpdate 10/9/15 We are down to one dev! lol it's not been out 2 months and has already been left to die by everyone except 1 person. Not to mention he will not comment on anything but the bug section because he got upset that no one likes his cash grab.\n\nUpdate 1/13/16 MULTIPLAYER REMOVED!, enjoy this broken single player game kiddies.\n\n(If anyone would like screenshots I will be happy to send them to you. Just add me).\nCHECK OUT THE ARTWORK TAB IN MY PROFILE FOR PROOF!\n\nHere is the amount of people in game and its peak for the days LOL\nhttps://steamdb.info/app/369080/graphs/\n\nPLEASE LOOK AT THIS!  IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BOTHER READING THIS SAYS IT ALL!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=517690350     Special thanks to my friend Cpt. Falconator!

You can't..all I could do was finding a pool of water and drinking..hurray.\nI ended that session walking on the bottom of the ocean (due to lack of swimming animations) and drowning myself thus putting myself out of this misery.\n\nAfter that sketchy first try I figured I'd give the Voxel Experimental version a shot.\nWell, altho I did spawn with a backpack, a helmet and a canteen, the game decided to spawn me under a gorilla which resulted in insta-dying.\nTo my frustration the game decided to spawn me at the same location 5 more times with the gorilla still punching me silly..great.\n7 or 8 characters later the gorilla was gone and I ended up harvesting some wood, stone, iron and gold, all of which turned out to be useless because the crafting menu doesn't let you actually do anything with it..great.\nAt this point I decided to find the gorilla again so he could end me, was the most fun I had in the game.\n\nAfter my encounter with the gorilla I figured I'd give it 1 more try, I saw some stones/ores in the distance so I made a run for them.\nWhile running I fell through the map and it was impossible to get back, exit game.\nRestarted the voxel version only to see that every new character now gets spawned under the map, GG.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm all for EA titles, but this shouldn't be on Steam as EA as of yet...it's completely broken, you can't really do anything, and the fps are a joke. DON'T and I repeat, DON'T waste your money on this.","December 6, 2015","false","7.8"," 329 of 354 people (93%) found this review helpful 138 people found this review funny","93","329","354","138","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BamaKaPow/recommended/369080/","BamaKaPow","BamaKaPow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BamaKaPow/","16 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe concept is very strong... a true survival simulation game with animals and environment instead of zombies and monsters. However, in it's current version it is hardly playable. The entire time I played I not once encountered an animal either on land or in water. The developer suggests finding a village to acquire logs which are needed to build your first weapon, a "beating stick". After about 20 minutes of wondering around without a map or coordinates or any other navigation tool, I finally found a village and two logs. Crafting is difficult and not intuitive but with practice and effort it will be ok. I was able to craft 4 sticks from a log. To create the beating stick you need sticks and stone shards which are crafted from stones. I was walking around on a stoney beach but was unable to find a stone. I became frustrated and gave up playing after about 30 minutes.\n\nThe game has nice graphics. The day/night cycle is a bit confusing as it seemed to get dark as night was approaching but once the sun set and the moon began to rise it became so light that I thought it was day. Just as I was about to quit playing, I heard a helicopter. It sounded like it was right above me or at least very near. When I was finally able to see it I saw it was very far off in the distance. Way too far off for the engine noise to sound so close. I couldn't see if it dropped any supplies or not.\n\nI'm not writing off this game yet. I'm writing this review on the very first day of release. There's bound to be issues. Allow the developer to correct the early issues and see if playability gets any better. I would not recommend this game at this time but with the strong concept I'm hoping it'll get to a point where I can recommend it. I'll add to this review as the developer releases new patches.\n\nIf you wish to see a video of my playtime, please see it at\nhttp://youtu.be/Jmpi2T9b7Jw","August 25, 2015","false","4.5"," 209 of 224 people (93%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","93","209","224","9","26"

Get your refund, because everything this game says its does is a complete lie.  0/10 - What Lipstick on a Pig Looks Like\n\nJust an update to my review, there is a user going by the name "Achskelmos" who apparently has nothing better to do with his/her time than to counter all the negative reviews on this page with some sort of snarky comment.  If this person is a part of the dev team, I would be ashamed.  If you spent as much time trying to fix this game instead of countering all the negative posts, then perhaps my comments concerning this game wouldn't be negative.\n\nTo get down to the nuts and bolts of why this game is bad... here are the base reasons...\n\n1.) Has a lot of glitches and other issues that make the game borderline unplayable.\n2.) The fact the game was released and to even play it you had to go hunt down a village to even craft anything because of the sheer fact that you had no way to gather or build rudimentary tools to even start play yourself.\n3.) Game is far from fluid, graphics are acceptable for a Unity engine game, but all in all, this game feels rushed, and for the money this game costs, there is no excuse for it to be this rushed, even for an alpha game.\n\nI personally love survival games, and trust me, I wanted to like this game, but there is no saving grace to this game at this point in its venture to even try to talk myself into any ideal that this game is worth the money.  If the price point dropped or perhaps if the devs took some of the negative feedback from the community and applied it to the game, then perhaps they could win back my business, but not in its current state... and thats as honest and straightforward I can be about this game.","August 30, 2015","false","0.2"," 208 of 228 people (91%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","91","208","228","19","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_SilverSurfer/recommended/369080/","_SilverSurfer","Kickz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_SilverSurfer/","956 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMy Experience so far\nCurrently the game starts you in the middle of a Jungle with no tool or weapons.\n\nEven after the 0.0.0.1.2.9 Patch which noted that you do now start with a default tool, the Beating Stick, this is not the case though, at least for me in SP.\n\nYour character does not attack or do anything without anything in its hands, which is fine. I'm just mentioning it so you know there is nothing wrong with your controls when you hit the attack/action keys without anything on you.\n\nTo get started crafting you must find one of a Villages which are located somewhere near the beach areas. When you walk around and see gigantic Rock formations, walk to those as the Villages are usually close by.\n\nThough, depending on where you spawn, finding a Village did take me anything from 5 minutes to 40 minutes.\n\nWhen you find the Village you will find your first Log, pick it up and using the crafting diagrams provided by the devs in the "Day one Survival guide" announcement start making some sticks.\n\nThe 4 sticks will then let you make the "Beating Stick" which will be your first tool. the Beating Stick, which is a branch, lets you now fell trees and mine small rock formations for rocks and ore, diamonds, sapphire, sulfur, etc..\n\nOnes you have a few rocks and made some more sticks, you can make the stone hammer which is a slightly better tool, chopping trees a little faster, I think, though that could be just my imagination.\n\nCrafting your first building is a little time consuming as you need 4 -8 logs for each item, such as walls, doorways, walls with window holes, foundations, etc.. Placing them is easy and very straight forward.\n\nAt this point I played 2 satisfying hours of doing the basics of this game.\n\nAccording to the crafting diagrams and the devs, there is tons of items already in the game, but I only found a few, such as plants or potatoes, which are plants you just hit with your stick/hammer and then pick up, similar to the potato plants in Stranded Deep.\n\nYou can craft a workbench as well but it takes 10 x Iron Ore. Iron Ore I was only able to get from destroying the small rock formations. Though Iron Ore is only a chance and those rock formations are scarce so that will take you a good while.\n\nUp to this point this all sounds great, while the game didn't really offer anything unique on functionality or features yet, I was looking forward to its more complex and unique crafting features, like tailoring, or making a reloading table, workbench , etc..\n\nAs I got ready to get more wood, one of the trees ragdolled out and smacked me in the face, killing me instantly while the Tree continue to fly across the map.\n\nDying, spawned me somewhere random in the Jungle, though I was able to keep everything I had on me which was OK, so of we go find our base. After another 30m I finally reached the Village again I started my base in.\n\nAs I reached the Village the game crashed. That's OK, no problem, it is Early Access.\n\nWhen I logged back into the game I was re-spawned in the middle of the Jungle starting from scratch. I just lost 2-3 hours of gameplay. Assuming this was only due to the crash I spent the next 1-2 hours re-doing everything I already had done, just to get back to the point I can continue grinding for Iron Ore.\n\nIt was late, I played for 4 hours now and needed a break. So I exited the game to the main menu and had some food.\nWhen I got back I clicked to continue my single player.\n\nI was now again looking at a screen with all my items and work gone. Wiped.\n\nConclusion\nWhile the game seems to offer so much in functionality already, the only way right now you can experience it is by playing a massive session and hoping the game doesn't crash.\n\nFor me the close to 6 hours I spent on this game so far were walking and wood chopping/mining without any feeling of progress or the ability to continue at a later point.\n\nWhile I was on the fence for a while, it was for that single reason that I cannot recommend the game in this current state.\n\nI know Early Access games contain bugs but the game is selling for €15 at this time (after the 15% discount) and I feel it is not worth that price at this time in the current state it is in.\n\nOnes the issue is fixed and I can save my state and can continue my game to access the other crafting diagrams from Workbenches, Looms, Reloading Stations, etc.... I shall re-visit my review of this game and re-evaluate it.\n\nEA Disclaimer\nBefore anyone starts mentioning "This is EA, relax, the game will eventually be OK"\n\nI do NOT buy or review EA games for promises, awesome road maps, developer’s best intentions or things that might make it into the game at some stage. Those are values I take into account when supporting game developers on Kickstarter but not when buying EA games on STEAM :)\n\nEA games, I buy and review for what I get right now, taking very, very much into consideration that bugs are acceptable in EA but also take into consideration that the developer felt the game was ready and in a good enough state to be going to the public and be worth the price specified.","August 26, 2015","false","5.5"," 90 of 96 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","90","96","3","8"

To sum the whole thing up i had extremely little fun in this game the most fun being staring at the sheeps. This game makes me question looking at greenlight games to purchase. If Gaben himself were to see this game he would spit on it and remove it from the game catalog.","February 9","false","0.3"," 77 of 89 people (87%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","87","77","89","8","5"

Controls are not intuitive and can not be altered without causing other issues.  Graphics leave alot to be desired.  Good concept but this game is at least a year from being in what I would consider a playable state.  Should never have been released so early.  This game is not in early access state, more like pre-alpha.  Don't waste time or money until there are some major updates not just the minor improved graphics to the game.  If the developers spent more time fixing the actual gameplay instead of trying to make the game look pretty it might be worth looking at.  A pretty looking game is not necessarily a good game and a game that's not pretty looking is not necessarily a bad game.  Seattletek has a great idea but just needs to focus on the important parts of game developement.  Get the mechanics working then make it look good.  Not the other way around.  I hope to see more mechanical fixes in the future not more graphical updates.","October 19, 2015","false","0.9"," 80 of 94 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","80","94","0","0"

There are many small details I really like, like the sounds, the realistic looks of the waves in the ocean, the thunderstorms, and the realistic looking lightning in the stormy skies.\n\nCrafting and resource harvesting is in and it does work for the most part.  Animals are way too hard to find and rare right now.  Bugs and glitches are overly abundant in contrast.  Physics and animal AI is simply non-existant.\n\nThe best and most entertaining part of my experience is captured in all it's glory in my above video at about the 30 minute mark when I witnessed my first and only animal I saw in the game, a zebra.  Watch the video to see how evasive it was in it's attempt to escape me chopping it into resources!  Also notice what the state of teh zebra was as it evaded me so well, lol.\n\nAgain, I can see glimmers of HOPE in this game however, and I don't get the feeling like the developers have made this game just trying to make a quick buck.. so that part is refreshing.  But it is a long ways from being anything that I can recommend at this point unless you just want to help support this game or the development of it.\n\nThis game at this point scored a 27% out of 100, and for more details about how it got that score, please watch my video linked above.  Two thumbs down right now, HOWEVER.. this could be a "game to keep your eyes on" as it develops further.\n\nThank you developers for showing me hope and promise in this game even though I can't honestly give it a high score at this point.  ..I'll keep my eye on it and perhaps re-review it after a few months time!\n\n\n-  Zaxx","August 27, 2015","false","1.9"," 83 of 99 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","83","99","3","8"

For 17 Euros there is no excuse for the state this game is currently in.\n\nHaving said that, is does look great, but at 0.4 FPS it better be. That is all the positive I can say about this game at the moment, since it is quite unplayable.\n\nPractically everything is broken, meaning that when you start a game, it is laggy as hell. Now that's not a problem per se, I mean I don't have a really fast processor, and I have to wait a few seconds for the world to load and stabilize even in Minecraft, but in this game the engine doesn't stabilize, it is stuck at less than 1 FPS...\n\nSo you try lowering the settings to the bare minimum, and that's what I did. Problem is, the game keeps rendering the world while you do this, even in Single player. Then you change the settings and find out you can't reduce the grass...hmkay, np... Usually this is done over the graphics pipeline and my graphics adapter is more than capable of handling that, so you press Save and return to the game...then the game crashes.\n\nWhen you want to quit the game, meaning you close the game using the interfaces in a controlled manner, the game crashes...???\n\nSince I was unable to even walk around, that is about all I can say, there is too much broken and too much questionmarks about the price, the state and the engine chosen to put more faith into this project.\n\nBut I have seen other teams start off like this and pull out quite succesfully, so I'll wait a few months, give the project some time to mature and give it another try. But bear in mind that this game is running on a personal license for the Unity 3D engine. This means that the developer(s) are allowed to sell only a limited amount of copies.\n\nBuyer beware, wait for others like me to check this game out and make sure it is playable, regardless of the content or features. The people from Steam have more on their minds than giving people refunds ;-)\n\n\n\nUpdate 18-10-2015:\n\nGame is now running at 4.0 FPS (in single player). Game no longer crashes after changing settings, and actually seems to apply those settings now. Starting a single player game takes a long time during which there is no loading bar and the game is registered by Windows as unresponsive, so a bit of a pitfall there (should load stuff asynchronized, so the interface doesn't freeze up).\n\nA little bit of hope is growing regarding this project.","September 4, 2015","false","0.2"," 72 of 83 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","72","83","5","14"

Yes ONLY ONE, UNO, UNE, 1 ! You can't delete it nor start a fresh new on it and by the fact erase the old one and since it doesn't have any savinf features because it save your game by itslef (like in 7 days to die), if you drop an item by missclicking while you are discovering for the first time, it is lost :D FOR EVER since it seems that the items dropped don't appear on the ground. So you better not do any mistake in your game or you will simply live with it even if you uninstall and reinstall the game, you will be stuck with the same game you did your mistake in.\n\nOf course this can makes me look only like a rage quitting guy but just imagine you couldn't delete nor go back by "exit without saving" your old gbc or gba pokemon game ...... what a pain in the ♥♥♥ would it be?\n\nSo at the end of the day, Age of Survival seems to have a big potential but if I could restart my real life, I wouldn't had buy the game at this stage of alpha.

I tried to equip the so-called "beating stick" to start resource gathering (this mechanic actually worked last time around), but it was bugged out (the beating stick slot said "11" - while being in the traditional "1" quickbar slot - and upon pressing "1" the number changed to "10", but still no beating stick equipped. Tried to press every single key on keyboard but no beating stick activated, so it was impossible to harvest anything). Quit game.\nTried launching the game a second time (wanted to give it a second chance) - now the game world was totally frozen, could not move nor do anything at all). Quit game again.\nConclusion: Uninstall game.

But it is worth it!\nI believe not really crucially I hope that in the future there will be an optimization of this tremendous game and for weak computers.\nI after all hope that many will agree with me and will understand me for the reason that the developer isn't guilty that the user has very weak computer and that the computer doesn't cope with modern game graphics on which engine Unity, this game is made.\nGame is tremendous!\nI very much hope for development of this game as I think this game has a high potential.\nI want to wish success to the developer!\n\n\nЯ очень доволен игрой!\nБольшой игровой мир.Неповторимые природные пейзажи, которые создал разработчик в этой игре- впечатляют! Это выглядит потрясающе красиво и я не видел ни в одной игре такой красоты!\nДа,конечно, чтобы лицезреть всю эту красоту вам понадобиться мощный компьютер. Но это того стоит!\nЯ полагаю это не очень критично я надеюсь на то, что в будущем будет оптимизация этой потрясающей игры и для слабых компьютеров.\nЯ всё-таки надеюсь, что многие согласяться со мной и поймут меня по причине того ,что разработчик не виноват в том что у пользователя очень слабый компьютер и что компьютер не справляеться с современной игровой графикой, на движке Unity ,которой сделана эта игра.\nИгра потрясающая!\nЯ очень надеюсь на развитие этой игры,так как я думаю у этой игры есть большой потенциал.\nЯ хочу пожелать успехов разработчику!","June 3","true","0.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","17","1","6","3","1"

I enjoyed the little while I was able to craft and use items like the axe and knife, managed to build a house, then I died to a hippo and was not able to play after that, each time I tried to log in, it kept my items but nothing was usable at that point.

The concept of the game is spot on, with survival game, where alot of them are about ganking ether than actually survival.   I'm an actually developer as well so I could knit pick the hell out of any game and say what is wrong, and I will not do it.    I feel we need more indie devs, so we can see different type of games,  I also see people wanting games cheaper, games have been about 60bucks for years, so asking 19bucks is not alot..  The devs lose 30% to Steam, so alot of people do not understand  that devs getting 10 bucks is not alot, game development is not cheap..\n\nJust for 3DS Max I have spent over 5k for it..  Thats just for me, if you have other devs, thats 5k per person.   Many other software is needed as well and cost money, so if a game like this does not make atleast 30k or more, than, they are not breaking even. Now I don't  what they used, but if they used free lance  programmers, artist they cost money as well.. Since I know they did use some , as I seen them asking on Unity's site.\n\nPS : I think if you want to see an indie do well and this type of game, I would support them.\n\nNow if your the type to get upset over bugs and indie devs , then I would stay away..\nIf you do not understand what early access is about, then do not buy either.\n\n","October 14, 2015","true","0.5"," 15 of 171 people (9%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","9","15","171","17","28"

Is it worth the price tag? No seeing as you can get similar survival games for cheaper and they're a lot more advanced.\n\nI will say though, these guys run a three man team. While the game has so much more progression to make, they're updating the game everyday / every second day. Small things, but it's a lot of progression for a small team.\n\nAs said, it has a long way to go.

WRONG! I paid for this game just like most people have. Yes i paid $20 for a game that is still needing a lot of work, b/c its a good game that has a bright future and it could go in any direction. I want to be their to help guide it along. to make it the best game possible.\nIf that makes me the bad guy, so be it. you can thumbs down me till the end of time. not going to change what i have to say about this game.\n\nI have many hours on it b/c i looked the game over, ran around and built buildings, cut trees down, mined rocks, all to make some of the guns and gren's that are in the game.\nI do take graphics into consideration, i take sound into consideration, i take FPS into consideration, but thats only a part of the game. I look at the game's depth and its ablity to broaden its core. b/c if a game has no way to expand, what good is it.\n\nim not going to lie, the game as issues. but the Dev team is doing everything they can to fix bugs. granted, their not a very big team so it takes time to fix bugs. but they are fixing them.\n\nGraphics:\n\nfor a game that is still in its early state, the game has very beautiful graphics. The game places very well for the amount of graphics. I like watching the trees fall, as they actually interact with other trees, and not just phantom though it, also don't stand to close to one, you can get killed by a falling tree.\nI have not phantom though rocks or fallen though the world. Some of the trees bug out and you can pass though them.\nThe weather in the game was totally unexpected. The clouds look like their about to rain on you. The first time I happened to me I was like, what's going to hit me now.\n\nTextures\n\nTrees look like trees and not something pushed out of a playdough cutter.\nThe water has a very realistic action to it, better than I have seen(as most games have all water moving in one direction, this one actually moves like water should), yet they have been out longer.\nThe rocks have good textures to them, though they do look the same.\n\n\nitems:\n\ntheir is a large range of weapons that can be crafted and just as many foods and so many more still to come.\n\nGuns/weapons: AK's, 12 gage shot guns, M4's, pistols, GRENADE's, nail bat, lead pipe, axe\n\nFoods: stews, pies, bread and all the animale meats.\n\nSmelting: iron, steel, copper, lead, stainless steel, Platinum and gold.\n\nGear: clothing, beds, ropes, rope ladders.\n\nObjects: nails, copper wire, scrap metal, shovels, bear traps, springs and much more\n\nConstruction. at the moment limited to wood, but their are circular sections and square sections. walls, windows, doors, roofs, work bench, engine mold(to make guns), furnace, loom, stihl.\n\nSounds\nThe sounds in this game are great, as I said above, when the storm that moved in it sounded like a storm that something big was about to come down on me.\nSounds transition from grass to rock to gravel to sand is extremely good.\nAnimale sounds are good and getting better.\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/pYfWE9At5sw\n\n\n\n(update 9/4/15)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ZXdOMv7NtB8\n\n\nAll games have bugs, and just like all games you have your people that take it upon themselves to attack the game and its creator.\nSeattletek is working insanely hard to fix the bugs, since its release\n\n\nI will post a few video's in the next few days.\n\nI love this game, it should be the one the other so called "Survival" games should take a hint from.\n\nUpdates:\n\n(update 8/25/15) he has released 15 bug fixes and is expected to put out more in the next few days.\n(update 9/3/15) new islands have been released, more to come. new crafting system, new inventory, and more items are do out in the next week.\n(update 9/4/15) new island maps to explore with new textures\n(update 9/21/15) new types of trees have been released with new textures.\n(update 9/21/15) new weather system, new sky textures have been released.\n(update 9/21/15) animales now attack if you get to close.\n(update 10/3/15) new terrian generator that creates unlimited(or as much as your Ram can hold) maps.","August 26, 2015","true","46.0"," 16 of 237 people (7%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","7","16","237","24","12"

It started as a nice looking project but in a short time from it's EA release turned to garbage. This is one of those titles that you really should wait until it's released. The selling argument for this game during and it's first release as EA sounded promising. However the updates since then has been a real disappointment. So do your self and your wallet a favor and stay as far away as you can from this title.
