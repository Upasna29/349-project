Developers seem to be really hard working, gameplay is great, and there are a lot of intresting things to find. This is also the only game that truly creeps me out when nighttime comes.\n\n\========PROS========/\n1. The only harvesting I've seen is mining, which is very quick and easy to do. Other than that, it's foraging, which keeps you moving.\n2. Combat is great. Not too easy, not too hard. (Though the enemy AI could be improved to make it more intresting)\n3. "Man I sure love sailing, I-" *Epic, heroic music starts playing* " OOOOOOOHHHH YEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!" (Good Music)\n4. Islands are very varied and intresting.\n5. Item spawns and drops are fair. It won't be "play-for-80-hours-to-find-that-one-extremely-rare-thing". You'll probably keep finding things you don't really need, but with such a large inventory space, and being able to sell them and buy awesome stuff from merchants, it hardly matters.\n\nOkay I can't think of anything else good to write about this game... so let's move to the cons.\n\n\=========CONS========/\n1. If/when you flee from pirate bosses, they seem to run loose across the entire (usually massive) island, instead of back to camp. So if you really want their loot, you'll be running around the island until you're bored.\n2. I'm not sure if this was fixed or if it was a bug at all, but last I checked, if you save, you die, and you go back to your last saved game, all items you consumed or lost are gone forever. Meaning saves only remember your location, not items. (Ex. Save before fighting pirate boss, whilst fighting use up 10 bandages and 2 potions, die in battle, you return to the location you saved at, but the items you consumed in battle are gone. Again, this may have been fixed, or may not have been a bug)\n\nHuh... you know, I thought I'd think of more things to write about in both pros and cons... oh well. Last thing.\n-----------\nNeither pro nor con (Stuff that takes away or adds to the game as the player dictates)\n\n1. Night creeps me out. It's realisticly dark, and you'll hear weird noises that sound like foxes. If you haven't heard a fox, last time I heard one, sounded like someone screaming. You can see why it would creep me out.\n2. "Oh man night is so creepy I-" *HISSSSS* "WH!? WAGH!? There's nobody there!? WHO THE HECK IS DAMAGING ME!? AHHHHHHHHHH!" (Unable to see spiders and if they spawn on any island is usually unknown. Keeps me on my toes when nighttime comes!)\n3. The new design for the Old Pirate Ship (And I assume others, haven't found them all yet). Don't get me wrong, it's great! But if you accidentaly land your ship up against the island's beach, it's pretty much impossible to shove off again without replacing said ship\n------------------\n\nOne thing that should definitly be added is colonization and being able to harvest resources. That way, if you want to be on the move all the time, you can still pick up logs (And sometimes stop to mine), but if you want to colonize you can chop down trees with an axe and build houses and stuff. How awesome would it be to make a huge port and town on a big island?\n\nHopefully the way I wrote this review doesn't annoy you, and the review was mighty helpful.","July 20, 2015","true","51.5"," 206 of 216 people (95%) found this review helpful 68 people found this review funny","95","206","216","68","0"

And then I fixed up their boat and sailed away on it. Colonialism Simulator 2015.\n\n10/10 Would "explore" again\n\nNo but seriously, Salt is an amazing game. There actually is quite a lot to do, even at this stage of development and you'll still spend hours playing it trying to kill all the named pirates, get all the ships, get the best armour, explore every island, etc. My favourite part though is that it isn't a punishing game in the slightest. It's "survival" in the loosest sense of the word. Running out of food only stops your stamina from coming back quickly, and as long as you have a basic club, you should be able to fend off most of the dangers of the world. That being said, you're never really truly invincible in the world and though there will come a time where you're pretty much self sufficient with your accumulated resources, it will take you a good while to get there. But the heart of the game is really about exploring the lovely landscapes, building cool ships, and watching the beautiful sunsets. So if you're looking for the Dark Souls of exploration games, this ain't it. But if you loved Eidolon or Proteus, you'll almost certainly like this. There's plenty to do already and plenty more coming with active updates and testing branches available for those who care about those things. There's plenty that still could be done (the UI could use an upgrade, the 2.5D grass could mesh better with the landscape, the AI movement could be better, etc.) but what is there is extremely promising and already a great pleasure to play with. I will definitely be following this game closely to see where it goes because I'm loving the direction it's taking right now. So try it now! There's a free demo, so you really have no excuse not to ;) Now if you'll excuse me, I must go back to being a pira- *ahem* an "explorer."","December 31, 2014","true","14.2"," 250 of 275 people (91%) found this review helpful 165 people found this review funny","91","250","275","165","5"

Islands contain mostly the same biome: a standard tropical environment with trees and bushes. Sometimes you'll find deer and rare resources. If you're lucky, you'll find some pirates on an island and some treasure chests. There is an early selection of loot to obtain. Other than that, after 4-6 hours you will have seen most of what there is to see.\n\nNonetheless I love the premise and potential to this game. A massive, island-scattered world to calmly explore, with manual ship control and plenty of ships to build. The  Windwaker-styled art and seafaring give this game real character. It's all immensely exciting and I do think the developers will succeed. In many ways they already have, as I personally have had a swell time.\n\nBut before I can recommend it to the general gaming audience, it needs more of the following:\n\n- Environments. Snowcapped islands, deserts, volcanic peaks and flow, cities, etc. Exploration demands variety here.\n- Activities to do on the islands. Let's see some dungeons and homes to explore, castles on cliffs, etc. Quests that aren't fetch quests.\n- Loot: more weapons and armor and categories.\n- More NPC's and creatures than just pirates and spiders and deer. I'd love to see the developers tap into various mythology for creatures to inhabit the islands and the sea, for example. Imagine leviathans occasionally slithering out of the deep sea and peaceful whales surfacing for air.\n- Speaking of the sea: there should be more to do while sailing. Whether that means interacting with creatures, dropping anchors, searching for treasure on the sea floor, anything to reduce the monotony would help. The fishing is good, but could be expanded.\n- Music. The main-menu music is a beautiful, Elder-Scrolls-like tune. But music rarely plays in the game itself, and it needs to start a little more often.\n\nThe good news is the developer is targeting many of these features and the game is still early in development. I have high hopes for this title, and once I feel it has solved some of these issues, I will update this review accordingly.\n\n(but if you're like me, a gamer who loves nautical and exploration games who can overlook some of the emptiness, then by all means jump right in!)","January 19, 2015","false","6.5"," 425 of 533 people (80%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","80","425","533","20","18"

There is a game to play, stuff to fight, better stuff to get, boss enemies to fight and so on.  But what really strikes me about this game is just how it stands out of the sandbox crowd for it's unique approach to the genre.  Light is always playing with the flora, land and water,  creating a neverending kaleidoscope of coloramas.\n\nWhile some may complain about the cartoonish style of the graphics, they compliment the game perfectly.  The ability to sail around in boats obtain better and bigger boats adds to the already bountiful list of things to do.\n\nIn short, if you are looking for a very relaxed, but very well made exploration game that doesn't pressure you with timers etc,  and want to just take in the amazing sunlight effects now and then,  look no further.","November 10, 2014","true","55.6"," 117 of 132 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","117","132","0","0"

You'll sail across a huge ever-expanding procedurally generated world looking for loot, hunting, fishing, fighting pirates, discovering ruins, customizing your ship and crafting new gear to help you on your journey.\n\nEvery Salt game starts the same: you wake up on an island with no enemies, a journal, a basic crafting guide, all items you need to build your first boat, weapon and pickaxe. What's next? Engage the high seas and discover!\n\nAs other players have said, this game is very relaxing and feel almost therapeutic. Kudos to the sound designer; all ambience sounds are top notch and very immersive. There's music too, but it only plays at the right times, like when you're on deep sea with angry waves, discovering something completely new, etc.\n\nWhile the graphics are cartoonish, the lighting is very realistic. The sunset in this game is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen on a videogame. It's so beautiful that you'll want to stop everything you're doing just to admire the view. Another element that means a lot in your experience is the waves. They feel like real waves, reacting to the wind with unpredictable patterns. You really feel you're sailing into the unknown as you see your last visited island disappearing and with nothing in front of you. You can craft a sextant or look for a compass to help you find your localization.\n\nThe downside of this game is that you can't explore underwater, there's only one biome and there's no weather changes. The good thing is that new biomes and dynamic weather are already planned and are coming soon. To know more about what's planned and the stage of development you can read the devs development blog (http://saltthegameblog.blogspot.com). Every friday they post something new. Worth the read even if you don't own the game.\n\nIf you don't know if you might like Salt, download the demo. There's little limitation on the demo (you can't go very far, can't use world seeds and can't play on hardcore mode), so you can almost feel like you're having the full experience. If you enjoyed what you played, buy and support the devs. When you launch the game you'll notice that you can continue your adventure from where you left on the demo. How awesome is that?\n\nAll in all, I recommend Salt for everyone looking for a relaxing experience. You can play without worrying of dying (you respawn every death) or you can play in hardcore mode with permadeath to see how far you can go. Don't be turned off by the cartoonish graphics. There's an incredible game here. Try the demo and see for yourself.","January 30, 2015","true","4.9"," 105 of 116 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","105","116","4","0"

This is a very addictive game if you enjoy aimlessly wandering around and loot hoarding, lol.\n\n\n\nEDIT: So, now stars have been added, pretty cool, only one issue, now when the stars come out there are fireflyesque things floating all over the place which first of all make no sense and second of all don't completely take away from your ability to navigate with the stars but they are definitely extremely distracting and well, they might make sense on an island but there should be no fireflies out on the water so I don't understand their purpose at all other than to add some kind of forced atmosphere during the day and a slight distraction at night.\n\nThe character models were really rough when I played it before but they have since been cleaned up quite a bit they kind of gives off a rough legos + campy feel, if that makes any sense. There also seem to have been a lot of other modifications made so it's looking really good. I haven't messed with the building options all that much, not sure if you can build a house or anything complex like that yet but you can put together a lot of other things like bow and arrows, shovel, mining pick, clubs, swords, etc. I definitely recomend giving it a try, it's a very simple/basic game yet rather vast due to how far you can travel from island to island.","June 14, 2015","true","11.3"," 75 of 84 people (89%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","89","75","84","13","3"

(your ship sails over the rising and falling seas)\n-Crafting system that requires either trial and error, a book, or a wiki. (I don't like ones that tell you immediately what you'll need and make the resources rarer to compensate)\n-Tons of lore, loot, and quests to complete. (and apparently now a story)\n-Good variety of items, ships, and environments.\n-old school tools for location finding.\n\nnow the things that should make this game a negative review\n\nCons\n-the combat system still needs some kinks worked out. (It's mostly either shoot while backpedal or hit, run to the water, heal, repeat)\n-no NPC ships or ship combat. (Boats and rafts are impervious fortresses that are never attacked by pirates, GET ON THIS PLS)\n-no guns. (around the era this game is going for, muskets have been around for a long time)\n-no wind system. (ships are the same speed in any direction)\n-no risk/reward for getting bigger ships. (if a ship you repaired gets stuck you can respawn it right next to you which is fine, but if you leave a ship anchored at an island, you can spawn it miles away, for small ships I don't care)\n-not many different types of NPCs. (bounty/wanted system would be cool, 3 main types of NPC, Shop owner, Inn owner, bad guys who KOS)\n-not much progression in terms of crafting.\n\nAll in all I like this game, however many more people may not, I reviewed positive because I personal would suggest other people explore this world which is really fun to explore.

I personally have grown tired of the Zombie Survival games out there and Salt brings back a more realistic and exploring feeling without all the zombies. Although you may encounter a random giant spider sometimes, it's definitely not hard to kill and they don't lag around in any way. You will have to fight off pirates as well on certain islands, but there aren't hordes of them and escaping from them is usually pretty easy by just running back to your boat.  There are a couple different kinds of boats you can craft to get you to the several islands all different from eachother. Some having abundances of food and materials while others house pirates and other threats, you might even stumble upon some ancient ruins and find a nice simitar or sword. You may also stumble upon a pirate ship floating out in the ocean. These require some maintenece to repair and get working again and also hold a locked chest with valuble loot inside. Killing a pirate Captain granted me a key and I was able to access the chest in the ship but from what I have read you can get these keys sometimes from regular pirates or if you happen to come across a merchant, you can trade or buy one from him. It's the only thing thats really useful that they sell at the moment, The other stuff can be found quite easily. The worlds are created via seeds and anyone using the same seed will experience the same generated world. You must hunt and scavenge for food in order to keep yourself alive while sailing from island to island. Getting lost is probably one of the easiest things to do in this game especially if you have a urge to explore a lot like I do as exploration plays a huge role in Salt. Take note of the different types of Pirates you encounter. One I found to be really useful was the Cartographer Pirate.  Upon killing and looting his body I was able to get my hands on a compass which really made things a lot easier when it came to navigating the almost identical looking islands. The game is single player only which is one thing that bummed me out a bit as I would love to be able to explore this world with a friend, but it is still very interesting. As far as graphics go, The art syle is great, the textures and models aren't that impressive until you see a sunrise or sunset which can really make things look beautiful. Overall the game looks very promising for its future and I will definitely continue playing this. The developers are very active with the community in the forums and I see them replying to almost every post which is what we all love to see with these Early Access games. I definitely reccomend picking this game up if you like Survival and Exploration games. You won't be dissapointed.\nPlease take note. This early access and there will be bugs.

And now some time later I've got some ancient armor and got myself a giant ship.\n* No hand holding. The game gives you a few hints of what you can look for in the beginning but that's it. Try to avoid the wiki or the maps floating around! It's more fun to figure it all out or to stumble upon a derelict ship all on your own.\n* Dev seems to be updating pretty frequently, so I'm excited to see what they will come up next.\n\nCons:\n* Combat feels a bit clunky, but it's not too bad. I wish it was more involved\n* We NEED a cartography system of some sort, even if it's manually inputting waypoints/coordinates. So far I've MacGuyver'd something in MS Paint. It works, but it's a pain to have to keep tabbing out. We need something in-game.\n* Enemy AI could use some work. Right now they run like a maniac if you stand in 2 feet of water.\n* Ran into a coulpe bugs, but to be fair it was very few and nothing too horrible. Worst one being getting hopelessly stuck in a tree after I got spooked from a giant spider nipping me in the bum. This was after sailing really far away to try to get to a jungle island the innkeeper told me about. It really bolocks'd up my entire expedition.\n\n\nOverall I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of exploration and want a relaxing experience.","December 27, 2015","true","21.4"," 55 of 56 people (98%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","98","55","56","6","1"

I'll be assuming you know the general theme it contains.\n\nThe time I spent playing Salt was incredibly relaxing. Like others have stated before, it's almost therapeutic. I believe this is what the game focuses on, instead of your typical Minecraft rip-off. Speaking of which, it's not a Minecraft rip-off. It's an exploration game of its own and definitely has a lot of potential to become an awesome and original game.\n\nIf you're looking for a fast paced action game, Salt isn't the game for you. Salt is the game where you'll find yourself idling more often than doing things of major importance, but in my opinion that's what makes it so lovely.\n\nPros\n-Relaxing\n-Original Gameplay\n-Open World\n-Good Lighting\n-Unique Water Dynamics\n-Very 420 Friendly\n-Arrow Physics\n-Plenty Of Things To Do\n-Bug-free (I haven't encountered anything)\n-Dev's Seem Active\n-Growing Mod Community\n\nCons\n-Strictly First Person\n-No In-Game Mapping System\n-Save files are not local (If you mess up, your items used while fighting will still be gone if you die)\n-Delayed Response Time (barely noticeable)\n-Pirates Are Landlubbers (they don't leave land)\n-Unoriginal Textures & Goofy Models\n-Animations need lots of work\n-No Guidance (You're often left wondering "What will I do next?" and not in a good way)\n-Unbalanced Difficulty (No Actual Combat Scaling)\n-Mediocre Combat System\n\nAll in all, I downloaded the Demo and shortly after I made a purchase of the game. Is it worth the $15? That's debatable. The Demo contains a lot of what the full game has to offer and will show you all you need to know about how it plays. The game currently offers about 6-24 hours of gameplay before you get less inclined to play it.\n\nMy personal (possibly biased) review and summary: Salt is a great game for relaxing after a hard day, and it's the only game I find myself able to play in those moods where nothing seems to be entertaining. It's very smooth and runs great even on my crappy laptop. There's occasional moments where I can see the game could make basic improvements but from what I've seen the developers are working on fixing all of the issues and take their gamers seriously on suggestions. If they keep up the work then Salt will become an endlessly entertaining and unique game.","January 18, 2015","true","11.9"," 59 of 67 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","59","67","5","2"

It has very few survival elements. I have seen some reviews either crediting it with being a good survival game (??) or expressing their distaste at it's poor survival mechanics. THIS GAME ISN'T MEANT TO BE A SURVIVAL GAME. It focuses much more heavily on exploration and adventure. You can't even starve to death at this point in development. (You should also try the demo before buying the game).\n\nSalt doesn't have the best graphics, not by far, but it has amazing content and amazing sounds, minus the combat. It is also in Early Access, with a lot of the features already implemented at the time of writing this review. More luxurious features are currently in the works, such as a weather system and multiplayer. Other features such as an underwater world and pirates sailing on the seas are planned, but don't look to be coming any time soon.\n\nThis game also has another interesting EA topic. It has, if you will, recieved the perfect pinch of Salt, in terms of attention and money. By this I mean that Salt hasn't gotten a lot of attention from famous youtubers, meaning it hasn't gotten the large playerbase of games like The Forest or Stranded Deep. What you will notice to be similiar about both of the latter games mentioned, is that their development is very slow at this point. The devs have slacked off quite a bit, as they have recieved the fruits of their labor before completing the task. They have millions of dollars at their fingertips, so why bother to finish the game? Salt hasn't gotten this treatment, mostly because it's graphics turn people away. Howver, the devs don't seem to be struggling with money. They have just enough to keep development going, and, hopefully, when the game is released, they will be rewarded with a much larger playerbase. They don't look like they will be giving up anytime soon.\n\nAnyway, on to the actual game. The game has very few bugs. It has only crashed once for me, and I think that actually may have been more of an issue on my end. It's not very realistic, though. The deer seem a bit out of place, for example. These may just be placeholders, though. Or they will be explained in the lore that the devs are working on. There are all sorts of islands, from desert islands to ancient islands, with crumbling pillars and statues. However, all islands except the desert ones are forested, and the desert ones are very rare. But this isn't a very big issue. Some islands are flatter than others, with rolling plains, while others have towering mountains that stretch far above the horizon. Some have pirates on them, and I have heard of rare Cultists and ancients reanimated statues on others. Some are uninhabited completely, while others have the occasional deer. Some have a merchant, or an innkeeper, or an entire pirate vallage. And the best part? It's all randomly generated, unless you choose to use the default world seed. The current quests are a bit dull, though. I have only seen one, Helping the Innkeeper, a one-part quest in which you must recover an innkeeper's hat from a nearby pirate village. However, he gives you an excellent sword to do the job, making the entire quest a bit too easy. Or maybe i just got lucky.\n\nThe seas currently have no dangers, not from sharks, not from pirates, not from drowning. However, it is possible that with the weather update it will become possible to be capsized by waves. And sharks can be caught using a fishing pole. You can't currently go underwater, and if you try you will be greeted with a dark blue rectangle. There's nothing there. However, the seas do look beautiful and the currently have dynamic tides, but at this point you can't get capsized, only look cool sailing through 4-foot high waves. (Which, honestly, aren't very big, but I think that's as big as they get at this point). The seas are used only for 2 things: fishing and travel. Travel is of course important, but fishing is, at this point, pointless, as you cannot starve.\n\nCombat isn't the bare minimum, but it isn't Chivalry, either. You can dodge and block (with certain weapons), and some weapons have secondary functions, like a backstab. You can find better weapons in your travels, and harder enemies. I believe the hardest one has 1,000 HP. To put that in perspective, I believe the player starts off with around 55 or 50. Of course, you can get armor that gives you an edge in combat. You will normally fight 2 types of enemies: Pirates and spiders. Other ones, like Cultists or Ancients, are very rare in the world. The AI is basically the same: all enemies seem to sprint at you, sometimes zigzaging, until they reach you, at which point they will attack you relentlessly. The pirates that I have seen make no attempt to block or parry. They only way to escape from enemies is to run to the water, which is thankfully usually not very far it your slashing adventures go wrong. However, I wouldn't even bother if I were you. Why?\n\nDeath doesn't matter. When you are killed, you respawn at the last point where you saved. However, you retain all of your equipment, even anything that you may have gotten on the island where you died. In Hardcore mode, you die for good, but your saves are retained, so you can just reload an older save. I hope this changes in the future, but perhaps that is just my opinion.\n\nTL;DR\nSalt is exploration based, not survival based. If you're looking for an in-depth survival game, look elsewhere. Salt has a very large amount of content for Early Access with more features planned in the future. The world is very fun to explore, save for the seas, which are a bit lackluster in content. The combat is very good, but nothing we haven't seen before. I would certainly recommend this game to anyone that is looking for an adventure in a game for a cheap price with a good amount of replayability.","July 12, 2015","true","5.6"," 55 of 61 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","55","61","2","0"

(I make the Minecraft comparison lightly, as Salt is very much a different beast entirely.)\n\nI would like to describe my feelings coming out of the Demo, though.\n\nFirst I started playing, and decided "Well, this isn't much, but let's try and build a boat." After some time running around, laughing at the terrible pirate models (Yes, they're cute, but I still don't like 'em.), failing to kill a deer, and not understanding how to craft at all, I finally make a raft. Then I sail around the islands that I started on for a bit. And then I get bored with that, and sail off into the endless void. Then the music kicks in. And I feel shivers down my spine. And I feel hope. Excitement. Joy. Elation. "My word," I think to myself, "This is exactly how I felt when I first started playing Morrowind and realized that I had this entire world at my disposal! So much to see! So much to explore!"\n\nI heartily recommend this game to anybody who loves the thrill of exploration. It made me feel things no game has made me feel in a very long time.

Shortly after you arrive amongst its vast chain of islands, you’ll learn how to build your first watercraft and then you’re off on a journey of adventure and discovery.\n\nYes, there are items to craft. There are tools and weapons you’re going to need in order to thrive in this world. But, for the most part, crafting is just a means to an end. You won’t find yourself investing hours in creating a fortress-like home for yourself. You’ll primarily build what you can carry with you. Your home, if it’s anywhere, is the endless sea.\n\nYou’ll travel from one island to the next. On each one you’ll find something. Maybe it will be as simple as food or the wood and stone you need to craft another set of arrows. But sometimes it will be something else. A village of pirates. Someone who needs help to finish a quest they can’t accomplish on their own. Ancient ruins. Or a tantalizing clue about a greater mystery hidden out there across the ocean. Whatever it is, there’s always just enough to keep you sailing to the next destination on the horizon.\n\nThis isn’t a frantic game. Not at all. It’s slow paced and for the most part, it’s relaxing to play. Sure, there are adrenaline invoking moments, such as when you’re trying to cut a pirate down to size. But overall, it’s about exploring. Finding out what might be on that island you can just make out in the distance.\n\nThe environment is rendered beautifully. The island foliage, the ocean waves, and the sunrises and sunsets are all exceedingly well crafted. Some have complained about the simplistic appearance of the pirates and other NPCs. While I would agree that they are very basic in design, from my perspective, they fit the world of Salt well. The sound design is excellent, particularly the noises that fill an island at night and the steady sounds of the sea. The music fades in and out at appropriate times and is never intrusive. The piano theme from the title screen is very well composed and particularly memorable.\n\nThe developers appear to be invested in the game and updates, at this point, are made steadily. Based on what I’ve seen on the forums, the developers readily communicate with those that have questions or feedback. Yes, Salt is an Early Access title, but based on what is here thus far, it is already a very satisfying experience.\n\nIn short, if you have a love of exploration and the idea of setting out across the sea in search of adventure appeals to you, Salt is a game you will probably enjoy. At the very least, give the demo a test drive. You may find the world of Salt as compelling and hypnotic as I have.","April 5, 2015","true","12.8"," 47 of 53 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","47","53","3","1"

I know this game is early access, but there just isn't a lot of things to build or do.  There are only a handful of boats to build at this point, and the bigger boats aren't that cool.  You can go faster, but it is harder to see where you're going.  I found myself ditching my boats all the time and building new ones.  Once you make a boat once, you can make it again without using any materials, but it just seemed silly to ditch boats and make new ones only because it is easier than turning boats around or traveling back to where you left them.  It would be a lot better if the bigger boats had some cooler featuers that went along with them which you could customize more and there was an incentive to keep them.\n\nOverall, the graphics are pretty bad.  I'm not someone that normally worries too much about that, but they seemed particularly bad on this game.\n\nI ran out of things to build and I'm less than 15 hours into the game.  I kept collecting all kinds of materials thinking I was going to find some recipes to build cool stuff.  After searching forever and not finding more recipes, I broke down and looked up a list of recipes online and was suprised to see I had already built everything.  I seemed to spend a ton of time collecting stuff that really wasn't good for anything.\n\nTons of people appear to like this game, but I just didn't think there is enough content to make it a good game (yet?).

Sometimes while playing Minecraft, sailing my little boat off into infinite oceans I wished...\n\nFor this game.\n\nYou start on an island. Your head hurts. You had been unconcious. A stranger has left you a note, and reccomends you leave your little island as soon as possible. You stumble around, getting your bearings. You pick up everything you see, you pick some fruit, you find a pickaxe and break some boulders and collect your belongings from a chest.\nYou have enough to make a raft and leave your tiny island, clumsily learning to sail for the first time, as you fight the wind and the tide.\n\nYou sail, you explore, you stop off at islands in desperate search for food. You craft, you fight. You manage to put together a fishing rod, and relax awhile. You build a sail boat, which is faster than your dingy raft. A compass. A sextant. Suddenly you feel more confident to explore even further.\n\nI very much reccomend this game, it is very zen and relaxing. And once you are involved in it, fairly pretty. I'd like to be able to retexture it and that is really my only gripe with it at the moment. It's a game I'm rather comfortable sinking hours into and for the price, you really can't beat the experiance.\n\nI'd also reccomend getting the 'Salt Charts' tool that someone made, it makes navigation easier on you.

The whole point of the game is to explore, and let me just say that Salt IS a great exploration game.  However, most of the mechanics were poorly concieved and/or do not function well.  Combat is less than appealing, as there is very little to do besides click and swing your weapon repeatedly.  Archery is frustrating in the least.  Crafting is, if not well thought out, reasonable.  The killer is that you need to simply spend large amounts of time gathering resources with virtually no gaurentee that you will find them.  Logs spawn randomly, as far as I can tell.  I would love to see features where you can harvest wood from trees, and rocks from cliffs, but until then, your only way of gathering resources is hopping from island to island searching the ground for stuff that (hopefully) has spawned there.\n\nCombat stinks, can't figure out how gravity affects arrows, and grinding for resources all take away from the truly fun exploration aspect.  I could tolerate this, but unfortunately the detract from the game dramatically.","January 9, 2015","false","14.4"," 52 of 71 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","52","71","3","5"

And for some reason it is extremely captivating (maybe because I love exploring).\nThe graphics are not too impressive, but from time to time you can find some nice scenery (sunsets and sunrises are pretty awesome too).\nThere is hunting, although at the moment there are only deers to hunt. There is fishing, but I'd found just roaming around to be way more fun.\nThere is trading, you can actually stumble upon merchants and sell the things you don't need, or buy something you want. Although, so far they wasn't too useful.\nThere is combat, but it's pretty basic (think minecraft style of doing things).\nAnd then, there's Exploration. Where you can just spend countless hours roaming around the seas and poking around different islands to find another chest, or another fancy item laying around. It's very, very fun (again, if love exploring).\nUpcoming quests, new biomes and other cool things will only make it better.\n\nOn the downsides:\n- combat is way to simplistic and could use a bit more depth (again, it's not the main thing in the game as I already said).\n- graphics are still quite glitchy on some GPUs (but devs are aware and fix is coming soon)\n- UI is not the best one out there (especially if you are playing on a large screen/have bad eyesight)\n- controls for boat could use some refinement\n\nMore detailed look in the video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp2fQYIFYWk","October 19, 2014","true","8.3"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","0"

It's early access and by no means near completeion, thus making it's price of £11 quite a gamble.\n\nMy experience with the demo was fulfilling as someone who's looking for something calm, peaceful, and relaxing to play. Although mush of the game's content is missing from the demo (not surprising), it allowed me to get an insight into what the game has to offer me as of now, and what it may offer in the future.\n\nIt was satisfying to control my raft as I sailed across the waves between islands, and - aside from the simple, yet altogether beautiful, graphics - felt very immersive.\n\nMy first encounter with an enemy, a pirate carrying a sword, was interesting - the combat in this game is simple and predictable, and provides users with the typical "attack", "powerful attack", and "block" features present in most games of this nature. Impressively, the combat in this game, although sometimes predictable (the enemy I fought only had one single attack) was an enjoyable quick break from the usual serenity of the rest of the game. Hunting, similarly, gives a small sense of achievement, and the rewards follow suit.\n\nThe scenery is very eyecatching and I have taken lots of screenshots of this game already, from the vast valleys in the islands to my boat drifting on the surf. There are substantial amounts of graphical settings which allows this game to be played on a wide variety of machines (and on high settings, I can safely say that I am impressed with what the graphics of this game has to offer).\n\nCrafting in the game is easy and simple, as well as logical, and there's a decent variety of crafting recipies already. Like most games, there is a slight learning curve (not just in crafting, but in respect to the whole game), which serves as a little challenge for new players.\n\nThere is lots of content in the game already, which is surprising considering how new it is. The developers have promised future updates, however having had the game for such little time I can't vouch for them. Any improvements I'd like to see in the game are very likely to be added in the future.\n\nAltogether, I find no bad points to make against this game. It does what is promised, and providing the developers stay faithful to their noteworthy creation, my rating of 10/10 shall stay as it is.\n\nPlease, before you purchase this game, do your own research. As with all early access games (and this game is VERY early access) you're paying for what a developer has promised you. I must say that the current game content is not worth £11 - what the developers say they will be adding, however, works out as quite a good deal for £11. Early access games are a gamble for the consumer, and this provides no deviation from that. Purchase with care.\n\nI, myself, am glad to be a part of this game's development, and will be eagerly participating on the forums.\n\n10/10.

If you are looking for cutting edge graphics, linear storylines, well developed NPCs, or  an incredible combat system this may not be the best game for you, but what it lacks in pure aesthetic areas it more than makes up for with game style, originality, and pure joy of exploration. I found myself completely immersed in Salt to a point where I was legitimately freaked out by some of the games content, inquisitive about other things and quite pleased with how serene the randomly generated worlds are. The early access game does leave some things to be desired; multiplayer, smoother graphics, etc. but the content, as lava boots implements it, feels very well placed, there are very few loose ends that are common with many early access games.\nI do have a few things that I would love to see in future updates; better sailing mechanics (let's face it, square sails are historically accurate, but are not the most efficient or visually appealing, Assassin's Creed Blackflag found a great balance in the sailing department) The weather cycles and new night sky are in the works, I am very excited about those, they will really help with an already immersive game. The story line could use a little work in order to ease the player into it sooner, but the journey of exploration is indeed a good one. The pirate captain bosses could be a little less random, I had trouble hunting down the last one.\nOverall a stellar game, It runs (fairly) smoothly on most machines, the new menu system is great, and I am looking forward to using my controller with the new patch. If you don't feel like buying it now please keep an eye on it, Salt is riding the waves to something great.","June 19, 2015","true","27.0"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","1"

As many reviewers have said, this is an exploration game, and it's still in Early Access. Best to return to it when it's reached a more complete state.\n\nI've really tried liking this game, but there are so many things which end up being just pointless grinds, and with no goal. I'll try to list the things that finally made me give up on the game:\n\n*Resource gathering - a huge grind. There are plenty of trees around, but the only way to gather wood is to find it lying on the ground. I find it really annoying that there's so much wood around, but I have to jump from island to island picking up a few measly logs each time. And to gather bamboo you have to run around in all the bamboo bushes to randomly pick up one bamboo, what?! Mining is the only basic resource that's quite acceptable at this point, but gathering a few rocks just takes too darned long time...\n\n*Food - Food is optional, but it does allow your char to regain health over time. So it's not a necessity, but finding some small morsel in a tropical island paradise should be easy, right? No! Trees don't carry fruit (although they supposedly do),  killing a deer is nigh impossible, and fishing requires you to have a fruit to craft the fishing pole. Maybe food is just a luxury.\n\n*Ships - Seeing on the wiki, I can't really see that there's much point in gathering lots of loose logs on the ground to finally be able to create one of the few ships available. The raft seems quite good enough imho, I can't see anything justifying the time needed to gather the required materials.\n\nBut the thing that really frustrates me is that the world is so incredibly dead. Like not being able to cut down trees for logs, are they made of plastic? Other than the sporadic deer, I can't find any other wildlife. A few spiders, yes, and something that (if you really squint your eyes) resembles a humanoid pirate, but other than that the world feels completely life-less.\n\nI really hope that they can fix these things in coming versions, especially making it possible to do stuff which feels like it should be a natural part of the game (ie cutting trees), and trying to make it feel alive. I'm not much for this graphical style, but as long as the gameplay is good I don't mind it. Like I said in the beginning, if you're expecting adventure with some action, you'd better return to this game sometime later when it's more complete.\n","July 21, 2015","false","1.2"," 96 of 152 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","96","152","2","6"

This game gives you freedom, makes you feel adventurous, and relaxes you at the same time. The survival aspect of the game at the time I write this review is not the main point of interest in this game, you only need to find food and eat in order to survive. There is no system for drinking/sleeping like in other survival games, this game does not focus on that. Let's not be fooled by this, Salt focuses on exploration, crafting, fighting for your life, fighting for loot, scavenging, and living adventures, and it is excellent at delivering that. The need to eat is just to spice it up without interfering in your immersion, and is quite enjoyable to hunt for some meat or search for anything to eat without feeling that desperate.\n\nThe only thing I can point out right now, knowing is still in early access, is the lack of wild life. I would love to see more animals implemented into the game, like small animals and birds, and maybe predators also, like tigers or wolves.

Yet I feel like after close to two hours I've seen practically everything on every island in what is an infinitely procedurally generated game. The reason is that (with extremely rare exception) every island follows this formula:\n\n-There is a beach\n-The island is mostly a single steep grassy hill\n-The hill is mostly covered with trees and bamboo and a few boulders\n\n\nHere's what sets the majority of islands apart:\n\n-Sometimes there are pirates who you cannot counter early on if you choose to fight them.\n\n(Side Note: Fighting more than one of them at once is impossible due to simplistic combat being combined with constant stamina drains, so no content is really added here other than you dying.)\n\n-Sometimes there is a deer that you can hunt.\n\n(Side Note: Why hunt it when you can hit the trees for fruit that doesn't run away from you constantly? It seems that if you can get close enough, stabbing a deer in the back with a sword takes off around 1/5th of its HP, at which point it doesn't even flinch, it just runs off with most of its health expecting you to repeat this long procedure of following it across then island then sneaking up on it again over and over again until it dies. You can find the means to craft arrows for a bow, however I have not been able to do this easily due to the resources I need for them not being very obviously attainable.)\n\n-On the starter island there are some starter items and a chest\n\n-You will very rarely find a resource called hardwood logs lying around for use in some specific recipies. Finding these is entirely based on luck and it can take a tediously long time to obtain a decent amount of them as a result.\n\n\nWhen I first hopped onto my raft and started sailing I found the experience quite charming. The idea of exploring a bunch of islands and discovering the mysteries of the world seemed really intriguing yet also pleasantly peaceful. I had come to understand I'd find pirate islands and new crafting recipies for decorations and larger ships, and yet while I discovered most of these things the game has already begun to feel stagnant, almost like there is next to no chance that I will find anything new or interesting about another island desipte sailing between many of them.\n\nMaybe there is something out there on an island that is really exciting and different, but after playing for almost two straight hours I certainly didn't find it. Hopefully as development continues much more content and island variety will be added and I will be able to recommend this. Until then save your money.\n\n\ntl;dr, The concept is great, but as of writing the game gets repetitive fast. Can't recommend the game in it's current state but I would encourage people to keep an eye on Salts development if you like the genre. Shows potential.","February 8","false","1.7"," 98 of 157 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","98","157","3","40"

However, if you are still interested then please read on.\n\nLet me start with the good stuff:\n\n-This game has captured a sense of wonder that I haven't experienced since Minecraft. With Windwaker style graphics, everything is visually appealing, and sailing to and from islands is somehow always exciting. Whenever I'm done exploring an island, I get giddy about the prospect of getting in my ship (you start with just a raft but can end up with a 3 mast behemoth) and sailing towards a new island or even just sailing without direction at all.\n\n-Though I mentioned a lack of constant quests, there are in fact a lot of quests in the game. The issue is that you'll have to do a fair bit of sailing to find merchants, innkeepers, and other quest givers. For me, this is actually a plus since the time inbetween quests really makes them seem special when you finally get one. The rewards don't let you down either. Just about everytime I've finished a quest I looked at my new item and said, "OH SWEET!" Even after 60 hours of playtime I am still aware of at least two quests I have yet to complete.\n\n-Fishing is great. I know this may sound crazy but I have spent hours fishing in this game. The great visuals combined with the realistic rolling of the waves out in the open ocean make for a very peaceful experience. Fishing itself is simple, click once to cast and click again when you get a bite, but it's not the fishing mechanic that is exciting. It's the peace and quiet, and the something like 30 different things you can catch (its not always fish). I found some really interesting stuff out there.\n\n-Ease of access. The game was super easy for me to get into and understand. The crafting system is pretty straightforward (you also start with a book of basic crafting recipes to get you going). It's a little hard to keep track of where you are going at first but I found a compass and sextant at about the time I actually started caring about where I was going so no problems there.\n\nThe bad stuff:\n- Combat. Combat at this point is rather uninspired as it consists mainly of standing toe-to-toe with enemies and hoping you beat them to death first. There are bows and arrows as well, and they do have different types of arrows which helps to spice things up. I've been lurking on the dev website however, and they say they aren't finished with combat yet so it should get more interesting as updates roll out. As of yet I have no reason not to trust the devs as updates seem to be regular and they listen to their community.\n\n-My other complaints are all things I've seen the devs address, such as the lack of weather (a planned but not yet implemented feature), and framerate drops on jungle islands (planned to be optimized). My complaints are basically that this game can't get out of early access fast enough!\n\nSo, if you enjoyed minecraft's sense of adventure and wonder and think you would enjoy sailing an endless world with lots of islands to epxlore, then I would definitely give this game a shot. Happy sailing!","January 3","true","83.0"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","17","17","3","0"

Well, I have found it.The controls are simple. Super easy. It literally takes like 2 seconds to figure out how the game works lol. It feels like The Elder Scrolls for toddlers, but it's so fun haha. It's still early access, so I wasn't expecting much to begin with. I actually put more than 7 hours into the game, Idk why Steam didn't record that but whatevers. From what I can see after putting some decent hours into the game, it seems like a Pirate themed exploration game. It's kinda' like a survival game, but it really doesn't come off that way. This game isn't challenging enough to be a true survival game. You start off on an island, you wake up left with a note, you see a chest, grab some stuff out of it, make a boat, get on it, and start exploring islands and whoopin' pirate cheeks, hunting deer, mining, and crafting stuff. That's literally all you do. The game lacks content, or at least I think so, but it's enough to entertain me. I kep playing because I wanted to keep going to different islands and exploring, that's what won me over, the thrill of exploring new islands. After a while it got old because I kept seeing the same stuff over and over again. BUT like I said, it's early access so I'm not complaining... I imagine the devs will keep building onto it over time, adding more and more content. AND OMG THE MUSIC...... THE MUSIC IS SO GOOD. I went to my boat at nightime while the moon was out to go sail some more and while I was out on the water this emotional theme song came on suddenly, and I mean it hit the feels hard. Kudos to whoever composed for this game!! But you want to know what the BEST part of the game is???? :D I got stuck in the middle of the ocean, I had no idea where I was and I didn't see any more land for 20 minutes, I was like "wait a minute..... what the h3ll is going on?". Completely screwed, then I decided to stop playing :D\n\nI still give it a thumbs up though, if I said I didn't have fun I'd be lying :)","October 29, 2015","true","8.1"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

It felt like the first time I had played minecraft, where I had no idea what to do, or what to build.\n\nAfter a few minutes of getting my berrings and looking around the starting island, I finally built my raft and got sailing. Steering the raft was a hell of a time, and I loved it. It felt like I was actually steering a raft with a stick. When I upgraded to the small sail boat, which was a huge improvement from the raft, I felt like I had accomplished a feat. The Pirates are challenging, at some point I wandered onto more than a few islands where I had no hope of making it out alive because I had the worst gear, yet still hadn't found the materials to make anything better.\n\nSalt definitly needs improvement in some aspects, but I cannot wait for what else they have in mind to add. I think what I would want added to the game most of all is some sort of rough sea areas where the waves are higher and more chaotic, and toss your boat around.\n\nI would definitly recommend this game if you want a chilled survival game with no zombies. Sailing around is great for relaxing while listening to the waves, the same for hunting deer on the islands. The bird sounds are impeccable.","February 2, 2015","true","12.7"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","22","26","0","0"

The core gameplay is fleshed out very nicely & despite the lack of in-depth content due to the game's early stage, it's quite enough to draw you in to see the finished product.\n\nOn that note, the gameplay is very unforgiving & gets harder the farther you sail. Before I realized there are beginning supplies for you on the starting island I had a rough go of throwing a raft together and decided it better to swim to a not far-off island to visit the locals. Spoiler: you won't see but a handful of friendly faces. Combat is difficult and that can prove frustrating until you figure out that every pirate has a dire fear of the ocean and as soon as you cross the tide's threshold they turn tail and run clear to the other side of the island.\n\n* the current lack of content may cause you to wanna wait on the purchase for a bit as in my 3 hours (at the time of this writing) I feel as though I've seen everything the game has to offer right now. Still, give it a follow.","August 30, 2015","true","5.3"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rebelraime/recommended/327860/","rebelraime","Rebel Raime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rebelraime/","264 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTL;DR: A finely tuned combination of satisfyingly simple sailing, well-handled first-person combat, and easygoing exploration in a gorgeous quest-completing lootfest package.\n\nI don't usually write reviews,  said everyone writing Steam reviews.\nI really like games that do something well. That special something, so to speak. The Soulsborne games have perfectly-tuned, responsive combat, and JC3 is all those kickass cutscenes you wish other games would let you play.\nWell, Salt has some of the most amazing exploration of any game I've ever tried. Sure, it doesn't have that moment-to-moment tension in something like RE4, or the feeling of 1:1 recreation TW3 has, but the feeling of quite simply being  free  (more on that later) is unparalelled.\nIt's not a complicated game. It's simple in its "Hey, you haven't eaten in two days, have an apple" survival mentality, and its "Y'know, you could just do this quest to get this one material" crafting mentality. Despite player-aid features ranging from bare-bones to not-implemented, the friendly community and ample player-created resources are easy to get through and easy to work with, and immersive ways of keeping tabs on your location and quests are coming soon, according to the (very active) devs.\nNow, don't mistake this simplicity for ease. This is not an easy game. It's no Super Meat Boy, but, at least until you figure out what you're doing, it will keep you on your toes. From trying to find a merchant, through brief (and responsive) combat sections, to realizing you're lost at sea and have no clue where you are in reference to islands and landmarks.\nSee, this is where I think the game both shines and drags itself down. Essentially, Salt is a hypothetically endless (its content may or may not be finite, there's just so much of it there's really no difference to a human player) first-person Wind-Waker-meets-Skyrim-meets-Latest-Survival-Game-on-Early-Access. The only "point" of the game is to get nicer gear, harder/better/faster/stronger ships, and shinier decorations, through two core gameplay loops somewhat like this:\nSail to an island\nDepending on what type of island, collect all the things/kill all the enemies/repair derelict ship/etc\nPut loot to good use\nProfitOr\nSail to an island\nReceive quest\nComplete quest by sailing to location and collecting X amount of Y (and possibly Z, A, B, and C) item/killing X (possibly Y and Z) enemy/find X NPC\nReturn to quest giver to receive reward\nProfitIt's relatively grindy, but I personally find the gameplay well-tuned and very enjoyable, from the amazingly weighty and relatively simple almost-two-button sailing to one of the best first-person combat systems I've ever tried. The acquisition of gear, materials, gold, and ships fills a particularly under-filled niche in my gaming desires, and the fact that the game looks so nice only makes it better.\nAnd don't believe the screenshots, because it does look  very  nice. The not-quite-cel=shaded lo-fi & low-poly graphics style is relatively easy on the hardware, but even when not turned up all the way still looks gorgeous. The colors pop in all the right places and, along with very tasteful placement of landmarks, make it easy to distinguish between the different types of islands, all with their unique features.\nAt the end of the day, Salt is still not a finished product. Little stutters and a few places that lack optimization (as well as a somewhat underwhelming options menu and little-to-no anti-aliasing) make that very apparent technically, and to a casual player the all-but-nonexistent beginner help in-game (there's a little more of it in the testing branch as of 3/5/16 than in the main release) may be offputting. But all the things that keep Salt from being an amazing game, rather than a really really great one are all things that will be fixed as it moves out of Early Access into being a full release. As is, it is better than a staggering majority of Early Access games by a very large margin (hell, it works, so that's better than 90% of them), and better than many full-price AAA releases *cough* SF5 *cough*.\nBest of all? It's $14.99. If you're at all interested, there's no excuse to not try at least the demo.","March 5","true","7.8"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","20","24","0","0"

In general, the game has a relaxing vibe to it, with the sailing across the vast blue, exploring the (seemingly) peaceful islands, and the colorful transistions from day to night. Filled to the brim with secrets and things to do, you'll get a lot of hours of play. Don't let the game's sweet candy coated outside fool you though. The game doesn't hold your hand after you begin your adventure. It gives you the bare minimum knowledge to set you on the right path, then that's it. Anything else is up to you (or you could spoil everything by looking it up online, you cheaters).\n\nThe only problem I can see most having with the game is the long calm before the storm. You're going to be sailing a lot and you're going to be foraging for crafting componets a lot. It takes a while to get some of the more decent equipment, but it makes getting them more worth while.\n\nSalt isn't that fast paced, but it can rise at any time. Its main attraction is the forever expanding seas and islands. If your a patient player who wants a never ending adventure, Salt is good choice.

Similar to minecraft but less complex in some ways. Making boats and traveling by sea is easy, crafting doesn't require a crafting table or anything at this time. The depth is probably lacking after a few hours of play but just in 60 minutes everything seemed new and exciting, I was learning the controls (which leave a bit to be desired) and discovering some new things. Different islands you will see when you travel have different plants, rocks, and other loot from pirates possibly. There is no set map, you have to draw the map yourself if you want to know how to navigate the sea. The environment is great. Combat is iffy so far. Pirates hurt a lot, though this is definitely a casual survival experience. It takes you a long time to get hungry right now, and usually you'll find something to eat anywhere you go. Check it out if you're looking for something easy to get into but do not expect a lot of depth in early access.\n\n\nUpdated review:\nAfter I've spent a bit more time playing this game I can say that there is a bit more depth to it than I first thought. There are more items and enemies than I expected. The map is huge which is cool. If you're getting tired of seeing the same stuff you can just sail far in one direction. There are some quests, buried treasure, loot from ancient monsters and other things I haven't even discovered yet. A lot of really cool, random, useful items. Different craftable weapons, armor, boats, and potions. Once you get a bigger boat you can even keep treasure chests on your boat, which will spawn with the boat every time you place the boat. My biggest complaint so far is the inventory system. There basically isn't one. You can choose to only see boats, weapons, usable items, but it doesn't sort them by default. There's no bag system at this time so you can pretty much keep whatever items you get on your character but I do not like this. It feels cluttered. I hope they introduce an improved inventory system soon. I've ran around my boat with my different treasure chests trying to remember where I put what. Aside from that, everything else is really fun and exciting. You can decorate your boat with paintings, fire pits, torch holders, and treasure chests. Gives it a nice personal touch. Once you get a bigger boat and start getting some more rare loot the game definitely starts to feel more satisfying. MOST of the time however, you will be running around, collecting resources. Wood, plant fibers, metal ore, and treasure. It's only once you get a few hours in that you start feeling more of the games depth.","April 11","true","25.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

As addictive as it is in it's current state, it's only at its early access stage which is incredible to think this fledgling game will keep getting better with regular updates, customisable pirate ships and other crafts etc etc.\n\nBe a part of this fledgling game as it takes flight.","January 7, 2015","true","70.5"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

I thought to myself: could there be any harm in trying SALT with its free demo?\nAnswer was: if I consider time spent in a flow of having fun and relaxation a loss, then "yes!" :)\n\nAfter playing the free! DEMO! for more than 8 hours, I clearly had to buy the full game. Just to show my appreciation to the developers for both: the opportunity to try out the game for free before buying into EA and their great work with this amazing piece of exploration game.\n\nIt clearly is a pearl and worth every cent I spent (I didn't even wait for any sale, this game deserves what the devs currently charge for). If you are the explorer type of gamer, you will find this "sailing-simulator" worth its salt ;)\n\nAnd if you are not sure: just try the free demo (it is the same game, just only the isles in your starter area spawn, so exploration is limited) - but for me it was enough to experience the soul inside the game.\n\nShip ahoy, sailor!","March 29","true","18.2"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","13","16","2","0"

Find food for survival, battle pirates, fish, hunt, craft items, read various lore, go on quests, go on adventures, and more importantly.... SAILLLL!!!!!!!!! If you love being on a boat or are fascinated by the ocean or both, then you will love this game. Take the life of being a lone castaway on a small start off island. You need to thrive. You need to gather resources that will help you survive. But these are not all on one island. You need to sail from island to island (which are randomly generated) and survive. It is a very relaxing time passing game. Its for the true adventure type players who are always up for some good exploration. The only bad thing about this game...no multiplayer. Seriously, this game would be ♥♥♥♥ing epic if you could sail and explore with friends or go head to head against other players. But not having multiplayer does not effect this game's awesomeness.

In the future it would be nice to see building.\n\nHiring crew to work for you would also be very nice to have. Pherhaps you can, provided the resources, set one to fish for you?

Now that they have added in the journal and map, I can happily make a decent review for this game.\n\nI will give this game, at its current, a 7/10.\n\nFor an early access game it provides plenty of game time that is completely sandbox and is no way linear whatsoever. The graphics are retroy like, and I like that. The combat mechanics do need some work. Archery in the game could be tweaked a bit and guns need to be added in. I mean it is a pirate game, there needs to be guns.

It is also highly replayable since the main goal is exploration-even if you are trying to get the same things again the journey to those items will be different everytime. Of course there is also fishing, searching for loot and secrets or merchants, finding various tree fruits, hunting, gathering materials like wood and stone, etc.\n\nThe graphics for this game don't seem very good initially, but in reality they are fantastic. When you are actually playing they turn out to provide a very islandy tropical feeling. Even the balloon shaped pirates (of which there are different types) turn out to be nice. Also sounds are great - Crickets chirping, birds in the morning and after, ocean waves near the beach...\n\nAnother thing is farther you get from land the bigger the waves get, which is just a nice little touch to have.\n\n10/10 best 15$ game you can get.","October 28, 2014","true","41.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","1"

Unlike most games of that genre (e.g. minecraft or unturned) Salt is a very calm and relaxing game.\n\nSalt is in a very early access, keep that in mind before purchasing it.\n\nThe game is based upon exploration, discovering new islands, finding new items, and meeting new enemies.\n\nThe AI isn't very good, deer that are runnning away from you tend to suddenly move backward toward you then forward away from you. But it's good enough for the game to be playable and infact, be quite fun.\n\nThe crafting system is simple and easy, just click on what materials you want to craft with and it'll tell you all that you can craft.\n\nThe enemies of this game are pirates and spiders.(I have yet to encounter others if there are.) Pirates use an axe as a weapon while spiders use their teeth, some spiders poison you.\n\nSalt may get boring quite easily, as game is set somewhere in an ocean you'll need to swim to other islands before you find cloth which is what is used to make a sailboat, and as we've learned from many games, swimming isn't a very fast mode of transport and will get dull very quickly. If you do find cloth and you make a sailboat, boats aren't a very fast mode of transportation either. So if you aren't that patient you may not enjoy this game.\n\nThe sound and music for this game was great! The music fit very well with what was happening and was quite good. The sound was very well done, most games today have sounds that only slightly sounds like what it's supposed to.\n\nThe art as you can probably already tell is not great, it seems that it's making alot of people immeadiately decide not to purchase it the moment they see the artstyle, not knowing that the game is good.\n\nIn conclusion, Salt is quite good in it's current state and has alot of potential.\nArt 4.5/10\nGameplay 7/10\nSound and Music 8/10\nAI 6/10\nOverall 7.5/10\nRecommended for those who like open-world, suvival, adventure games but also want to be calm and relax.\nKeep up the good work lavaboots!\n-Mark","October 28, 2014","true","2.9"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

Why? Because it's unique and takes a very simple concept that alot of people have wanted for a long time and makes it fun and enjoyable even in its early stages.\n\n----Gameplay----\nThe gameplay of the game is similar to games like 'Minecraft' where you gather items and craft them although this isn't a voxel game so don't expect any digging. You start with nothing and have to gather wood and plant fibers from around your little island to make equipment but you don't have to look too far as somewhere on your island will spawn a chest that gives you the essential items to build a small raft which you can use to explore other islands.\n\n---Combat---\nThe games combat system is currently buggy and not great but for early stages it works ok, it's your basic left click attack and right click block or for items such as the dagger left click is another attack. You can dodge which is something you should do often as they do do quite a bit of damage and without a good weapon they will lower your health fast before you can lower theirs.\n\n---Sailing---\nThe one key aspect of this game which makes the game what it is. It's simple, you hold 'E' on the wheel or paddle and use the mouse to steer manually, you will have to recenter yourself if the waves knock your ship or if the wheel/paddle isn't straight.\n\n---Crafting---\nCurrently all I know of the crafting is the basic guide you are given at the start which gives you essential things such as Clubs, rafts and other items so I can't comment on how much you can craft but I have found few things not on their such as the compass.\n\n---Other Things---\nAcross the vast ocean you will come across broken ships which you will need to repair in order to use them and on the ship are chests which you can open if you have a key which can be obtained via pirates on islands, you can also obtain gold for merchants off them. I believe you will find 1 pirate per campfire so be warned if you see quite a few. 1 Variation of a pirate are the 'Pirate Captains' which are more powerful and have more health so be warned. There are also wildlife such as deer on the islands and their meat replenish alot of hunger. There are also merchants but I am currently unsure of their wereabouts.\n\n---Things I hope will be in it---\n\nMultiplayer: Obviously, who doesn't want to sail across the vast ocean with their crew, maybe even mmo type servers with PVP.\n\nWorkshop: Maybe have a character creator for online similar to Minecraft. Maybe even custom worlds and stories.\n\nMore Items: The more items the better!\n\nMore Ships: The more ships the better!\n\n---Conclusion---\nThis is a must buy game for survival and pirate lovers as it truly is a great game.\nI give the game a 9/10 for being fun, unique and really well thoughtout.\n\n---YouTube---\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO7tW_s6Mpo","October 19, 2014","true","5.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It's one of the best survival games I've played in a while, and is filled with content.\n\nI was initially  turned off of salt due to the graphics. I though it couldn't hurt to play the demo, so I did. After around 2 hours in the demo I bought the full game. Salt allows you to start off from ehere you were in the demo, which I think is great. If I hadn't played  the demo I probaly wouldn't have ever played Salt, but I'm happy I did.\n\nBefore this, I was playing Subnautica(also a great game) and I felt there just wasn't enough content, and I was worried this would be the case for Salt as well. After 50 hours, I'm almost at the end of the story, and theres still a lot to do after that. I feel, even with mapping implemented you should find a map online. I just sailed around initially, in a random direction.\n\nI almost stopped playing Salt. I was sailing around, killing pirate captains, and I had 2/4 materials used to make a new ship. I sailed to another island and found no materials for the ship, and assumed I would have to find the islands where I initially found the pirate captains. I sailed to another island, and another. And I found another captain, to my delight. I used a map from then on, as finding some of the items I needed was taking a very long time. Salt's sailing seems boring, until you see how much you can do while sailing. Fishing, mainly.\n\nSome quests are irratatingly vague, and some of them, even after looking on the wiki are incomplete. Salt's main quest has you sailing around, at first with coordinates, and then until you find the island type you're looking for. This is another reason I recommend using a map, as you won't be wasting you're time.\n\nNow onto things I didn't like about Salt. The crafting system makes you wait for thing to get crafted, but was overall a minimal annoyance. Fishing is fun sometimes, but you never know how to catch certain fish without looking it up in the wiki. The combat system is pretty lackluster, as the most advanced technique you can use is a dodge. I also wish you could build on islands, but this is upcoming feature.\n\n\nIf you're considering buying Salt, play the demo first.","April 17","true","50.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The sailing feel in this game is one of a kind, just sailing made the money worth.

The devs really did a fantastic job on creating the ocean. Sailing on it you could almost get seasick. At night the moon reflects off the swells and it is so calming.\nOn land, you have many challenges to face, pirates, etc to fight and also spiders to kill.\nThe trees and plants offer fruit or some type of flower that you can consume to heal or run faster or glow brighter...\nThere are lots of different quests to do and some are harder than others. But when you complete one, you get a reward.\nKilling pirates is also rewarding. Each one carries some type of item that is useful to keep or trade to a Merchant.\n\nThe graphics have become a great deal better since I first played. Every friday there is a post on the blog about what's to come and so far, I have not been disappointed. It just keeps getting better and better every week.\n\nIf you have an issue or question, the forum is very helpful  always giving advice.\nThe devs are doing a very good job on responding to your requests.\nI initially got the demo and played it for about a month, then finally purchased the full game.\nI am so glad I did.\n\nCheck out the Salt Wiki or their Development Blog to find out more.","July 14, 2015","true","770.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Some of them can be crafted others require a certain quest.\nYou start with a basic sailing raft, repair an old pirate ship and finally build you own huge bark.\n\nIt takes some time to get access to the really big and fun ships but it's really worth it.\nYou'll just start feeling like a pirate sailing one of those heavy bulky things through the ocean.\nIt's even possible to customize your ship by placing beds, torches, chests etc.\n\nOnce you have a decent ship, it's time to explore the different randomly generated islands.\nDepending on their type (desert, jungle, pirate township...) you can find different resources and NPCs.\nSome of them are very small and others are huge including mountains and small pirate villages.\n\nSalt has a very unique art style which may seem unrealitic and childish at first but it manages to generate beautiful flora and a very authentic island - caribbean atmosphere. Especially the lighting while sunset and sunrise is purely gorgeous.\n\nWhat I don't like\n\nThe start is quite tough. There are basic information about crafting and controls but it's hard to master the first steps. You may want to watch/read some guides and look up the official Salt Wiki for details.\nThe game itself isn't complex once you've learned the basic mechanics.\n\nIt has some mild performance issues like FPS drops and stuttering.\nIn general the game needs a lot of GPU power if you don't turn down the grass and foliage details.\nSo you should have at least a good mid-range GPU to maintain a rather dense flora at 60 FPS.\n\nThe good news? It has a demo, so just try out how good it runs on your rig ;)\n\nThe demo is a good way of testing the game anyway but keep in mind that the real fun starts after its limitations.\nSo just check if it runs well enough and you like the art style.

There are quests, boss fights, the ship models have been redone (and are MASSIVE compared to the old models), and the characters have unique designs now.  When the game was first introduced, NPCs looked like gingerbread men.\n\nThis is essentially the pirate version of No Man's Sky.  You won't be finding insane aliens, but you never know what you will find on an island.\n\nAfter a while they become repetitive and you can see the patterns on how they're generated, but the creator is pretty good at adding new content to spice it up.\n\nThis is a great game to play when stressed out or overworked.  You don't need to worry about death or starving, you keep all your loot and hunger is just a buff to your health and stamina.  It isn't really a survival game, it's all about exploring and mapping where you've been.\n\nSpeaking of maps, the most recent update finally added the ability to create your own map, as well as journal entries.  Set sail and write about your adventure!\n\nPros:\n-Massive sense of scale.  I don't know if the map is infinite, but so far it seems like it\n-cute designs on the NPCs\n-great sense of exploration\n-rewarding combat (learn to use traps, parry, and use the terrain!)\n-repairing an Old Pirate Ship or crafting a massive ship after using a dinghy or raft is a great feeling of accomplishment\n\nEarly Access Cons - stuff that's wrong for now but will hopefully be resolved:\n-A few bugs, but it's still EA.  The cartographer NPC can spawn below the tideline and just stand there as the tide washes over his head, for example.\n-NPC enemies can be OP at first, meaning the only way to beat them is to trick the game into getting them to stand still or run away by jumping to and from the edge of the water.\n-While there are quite a few island types, it could use more\n-ships appear to have cannon ports, but there are no gunpowder based weapons of any kind.  Not sure if this is to be changed.\n\nNeutral:\n-No multiplayer.  Not sure if this is a pro or con.  Pro because it's nice and quiet, a good way to escape, con because this would be a great way to explore with friends.  Especially since ships are so massive\n-No wind direction.  Makes sailing awkward when you can sail full speed in any direction, but if there was wind direction you'd be tied to the wind...\n\nOverall, 9/10, can't wait to see how much more Salt will grow!","May 20","true","45.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It has crafting, exploring,fighting and uncountable small islands. There is a hardcore mode to choose if you like.  So far I've only played a couple of hours and know very little about this world.  I expect to play many more hours. After starting, I quickly became used to the limited graphics, etc. I hope that improves sometime, but the game is immersive for me now anyway.\n\nStarting small, I began to experiment with what I found to see what I could craft with it.  It might be a good idea to gather materials for a campfire because nightime, until the moon rises, is very dark.  A basic crafting book was included in my inventory.  I found that starting with this book made the learning curve OK so far. I didn't have to find a log, pick it up and wonder what to do with it.  Making tools and weapons is critical. It's all about surviving first, more later.  Hotkeys made it quick to put what I needed in my hands.  I learn to make a basic watercraft and hit the seas!  (Salt water, I assume) Steering to an interesting looking island was difficult for me to learn.  Other people will certainly find it easier. The first unknown island introduced me to someone who seemed angry and determined to remove me.  He announced his attack with a little yelp, which I appreciated.  I hotkeyed to my neanderthal style club and engaged!\n\nThe day/night cycles are fast.  I haven't timed them but it seems about like Minecraft.\n\nTry this game! I believe most will enjoy it.","November 17, 2014","true","18.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

It has alot of potential. I love the atmospheric noises such as the ocean water, the birds and much more. However, There are alot of spinoffs of survival games recently; The Forest, Stranded Deep and FarSky just to name a few. Therefore, the Salt Devs are going to have to compete for thier spot on Steam. This could mean alot of things such as Play to Win features, DLC including super OP weapons, and Advertisment Spamming.\n\nI doubt very much Lavaboot Studios (Salt Devs) would do this because overall, they seem pretty laid back and just trying to get by. Also, the support for Salt is outstanding. The Devs listen to what you say in the Bug Reports and always get back to you within 1-3 days with progress.\n\nAdditionally I am not 100% satisfied with the game, There are alot of things I would like to see such as:\n\n1) VR Support\n2) Better Ocean mechanics (looking underwater in the ocean will display a pitch black screen)\n3) Multiplayer (This Idea has been brought out by the Devs, but alot will have to be added to make multiplayer enjoyable)\n4) Redesigning People. People in this game (Merchants and Pirates) look like a midget with a slight case of aspergergers and/or Down syndrome. Not making fun of anyone with those illnesses but its true.\n5) More Merchant Locations: I only found ONE measly merchant while playing Salt! I mean Cmon.

By the time you read this, the game might drastically have changed.)\n\nSalt is an open-world exploration game featuring boats, pirates, spiders, islands, and lots of water.\n\nYou start off on an island without anything but a book, and you're tasked with creating a boat, or rather, a sailing raft. "How do I create a raft?" Press "u" to open then tutorial book. It'll tell you that you need to find logs and cloths. "Well, how do I find logs and cloths?", you explore the island. Logs are scattered everywhere, and cloth is made out of plant fibers, which is also scattered everywhere.\n\nOnce you've made you raft, you're free to explore the ever-expanding, randomly generated world of Salt. On your journey you will discover a lot of different things, and you might have to consult the wiki at times. The wiki is however, not your only way of finding recipes. The are books scattered around the world which contain several recipes, telling you how to craft different weapons, boats, and even potions, among many other things.\n\nAs I said earlier, the game contains pirates, spiders and boats. This really adds to the element of the game. It might make you rethink how you approach a pirate camp, or how you  might go hunting for loot, and deer in the night. During the night, it's pitch black. It's hard to see anything, really. You can craft a torch, though, to make it easier to see what's infront of you. However, before you do that, I recommend making a weapon.\n\nBack to the pirates though. Unfortunatly, there are no pirates on the sea yet. You can find abandoned pirate boats, but without pirates in them. You can however, find a variety of pirate establishments on land. They all contain different tiers of pirates, each of them harder than the other. You might not want to fight the highest tier pirates at once in the game, so I suggest you make a sextant and write down the coordinates of that island for later (Recipe can be found on the wiki, or in a book).\n\nSalt is one of those games that lets you explore it's gigantic world without limits. It lets you upgrade your method of transportation to make it faster, and it makes you rethink how you might approach a horde of bandits. I am very eager to see how this game will develop in the future, and I have high hopes for it. This is a game that I would recommend for anyone.","January 25, 2015","true","12.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

You find a dead pirate next to that of a chest, You aquire some supplies. You build a raft, and venture out to other islands. There is no main quest. (aside from little reward side quests.) You can literally make your own quest, like saying to pillage every pirate you see, or create a massive house on an island and name it Haven, or something along the lines of that.

I would personally recommend it, but I could see how some people could find it boring, and at a few times just gathering resources. I don't really mind that though because it's habitual for me now to just pick up resources when I stumble over it.\nThe music plays infrequently (only when you are in deep ocean, near a merchant/inn, or some special fight), but its very nice when it does play.

Also, the boat models are really cool, and at this time I can't wait to see the other models.\nSo, if the boats and the pirates were just so bad that they were bothering you, fear not! They look much nicer now. There's also a new jungle island, but I can't say much about that because they are accessible farther into the game.\nIf you are thinking about getting this game, keep in mind that although it may seem rather shallow at first, Salt has quite some depth and hidden treasures, both literal and figurative.","April 5, 2015","true","96.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Salt is one of those games where you can barely tell it's in early access, and each update feels like you should need to pay for a new game.  Salt is quite possibly in my top five games for the genre, (believe it or not) surpassing minecraft and gmod, and about tied up with Rust.  with base building  on the to-do list and multiplayer, this game will be amazing.\n\n10/10 would play for hours on end and forget to sleep.","December 30, 2014","true","8.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","5","6","3","0"

It reminds me a lot of Zelda Windwaker, which I loved, so finding this game was a major win! The world feels a little empty still, but I imagine that will change as the game continues to develop prior to full release. Right now there are a lot of fairly empty islands and it can get a bit tedious stoppings at every one to see if there's anything interesting there, especially when the answer is usually no. Still I'm enjoying it a lot, just managed to repair one of the scattered pirate ships and am decorating it and enjoying having a full blown home on the seas, not just a wee sailboat. :)\n\nI do very much recommend this game, with the caveat that it IS early access still and it shows with the emptiness of the world and some quest givers don't have quests to give yet. I look forward to being a part of it and watching the game progress and fill out.\n\nTo the developers, I'd love a more comprehensive help guide, perhaps even a tutorial 'quest' that shows you how to do most of the necessary things. Also, a more user friendly crafting recipe book would be great - as it stands it's lots of scattered recipes in handfuls of books that clutter up my inventory. I'd love to see it all compiled (as recipes are discovered) into a single journal accessed through a UI button/icon. Or at least just one book in my inventory for all recipes for crafting things of all types. Also a MAP! Right now I'm writing coordinates in an IRL paper notebook, but it'd be fun to have a map I could open and, as I discover things, mark them on an actual in game map I could then go back to. Perhaps in conjunction with the sextant, have an option to mark down a location when you get the coordinates from the sextant such as "Do you wish to save this location on your map?"","June 26, 2015","true","30.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","2"

It's a very relaxing and tranquil game, but it also has it's moments of excitement. I nearly jumped out of my skin the first time a deer cried out near me when I was exploring in the dark, and I've scared myself silly with natural jump-scares caused by the realistic shadows from the torch at night, or by bits of foliage that I was sure were monsters. The pirate battles can be pretty exciting too.\n\nThe graphics are amazing. A simple design but very nice lighting effects. I get a real feeling that I'm exploring paradise.

Light is the focal point for the majority of the impressive visuals, with shadows not only playing an important aesthetic role but also playing a minor practical role in allowing you to see which direction you're facing while in the middle of a forest without being able to see the sun itself, seeing an animal's shadow before you actually see the animal itself, etc. The game environment simply looks awesome. However, I took two points off because of the minecraft-esque pirates and other blocky models of objects within the environment. 8/10\n\nSound\nI find the music to evoke emotions of hope, exploration, and/or mystery. It's very appropriate for the type of game and I actually enjoy finding deep ocean because of the music. However, there simply isn't enough scenarios in the game where developers find music appropriate. You won't hear music for much of the game, but when you do you'll be asking why there isn't more.\n\nThe sounds are on the right track, but need some more TLC (add more "scary" ones that play under certain specific conditions). There's one sound in the game that (from my experience) tends to play when you're running through the jungle at night. It's a loud "HHWWWOOOOSH" in a high pitch that sounds like some sort of shade attacking. Maybe it's supposed to be an owl or something, but it makes me jump every time. On one occasion I shot an arrow into the shadows of a tree I heard it from, and shortly after laughing at myself for it I turned away to look at a deer down the beach. Right at that time my character's head made a "thunk" sound and my character's vision went down as if hit in the back of the head, temporarily turning my vision downward. I turned all around and nothing was anywhere near me. WTF. I left the island and camped on a nearby one until sunrise. 8/10\n\nStoryline\nYou are a person that wakes up on a tropical island with nothing but the bare essentials. On your person is a journal left by someone else that tried waking you. This is how your journey begins, and as far as character backstory or finding the person that left the journal, I can't speak to that since I haven't come across either. I didn't rate this since it's an exploration sandbox adventure game with an anonymous protagonist. There's only so much you can do with story in a game like this. Open-ended is just better in general for this type of game.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay reminds me heavily of classic Everquest. Not necessarily the combat, story, or any other aspects that make a game an MMORPG, but the first-person perspective, the blocky character models, and the large expanse of water and oceans reminds me of the old boat routes, only now you can sail your own boat. I think my review is skewed because of my nostalgia for that game, so keep that in mind.\n\nCombat is mostly just left click, right click to block if it makes sense with the weapon (otherwise hold left click down to do special attacks), and manage your health with buffs/bandages/potions. The accurate trajectories the developers put into arrow paths makes bows easily the most fun weapon you can obtain. At least there's some skill in that.\n\nThe sailing in the game is intuitive if you understand rudders, and you'll pick it up quickly enough if you don't. They make it so you can't lose your boats, which is nice, but I think they also coddle players. The game itself seems pretty easy after you get over the hump of not initially being able to find food easily. However, I've never ran out of food and I heard it doesn't do anything but prevent stamina regeneration (also similar to EQ!). There is a huge aspect of the survival game that eventually gets thrown to the wayside after about five hours or so once you stockpile food.\n\nOverall the gameplay is very much what I expected, but they should put more on-use items in the game, or add some way to spice up combat/cartography/whatever. The game just needs new things to do. A lack of bugs and smooth gameplay keeps this rating from dropping lower. 8/10\n\nOverall Experience\nI have mixed feelings about Salt. I think at its core it's a really good game with a lot of potential. The basic premise pulls you in, and the graphics and immersion that they provide with the environmental sounds and lightplay create a really beautiful sandbox.\n\nThe problem therein lies that this game is part adventure/RPG and part sandbox. There is some semblance of progression, but never pressure to actually progress. Progression also seems to fall off after a time, though I haven't explored more than a 20x20 grid to the southeast of origin. This doesn't sound like much if you've only play the game a little bit or not at all, but it's actually a huge time investment to clear an area of ocean and take note of the islands and what's on them. In fact, it can sometimes be a little tedious. I've also sailed a straight southern bearing for 40 grid markers to corroborate some of the info in the wiki.\n\nWhat I'd like to see is an in-game system of cartography so that I don't have to use coffee-stained grid paper for my map. Additionally, I think the game needs to explore its adventure/RPG side a bit more and come up with an overall storyline for the world that players can figure out over time, exploration, and an inquisitive nature. There should be pirate clans that war with one another. There should be islands with dungeons related to the ruins you find around the world. These things should be introduced in the same way that all things in Salt are introduced: through exploration. The story and hard content simply needs to be there for players to find. The worst thing they could do is simply focus on allowing players to collect decorative items for their ships...\n\nSalt is a very clean game that has a lot of potential. I really hope they'll consider adding more content to up the replay-value of the game. Right now I'm not sure there's enough content in the game to keep me playing past 24 hours. For a sandbox adventure explorer I would expect a much higher replay value. For its current stage of development I give salt an 8/10.","March 22, 2015","true","24.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I purchased this game on a whim one day, and I can say that it did not disappoint.  Salt is not a game for Action lovers.  It's not even a game for adventure buffs looking for an engaging story, but Salt provides a beautiful open-world sandbox adventure game with just enough mythology and folklore to keep you sailing on.  Travelling can be dull at times, especially when you sail for long periods of time without even seeing another island to explore, but these moments are not overly common.  There are a plethora of items to find, gather, craft, etc. though the crafting and inventory menus are still a little rough around the edges for me. (I should note here that I have not played the game since the latest update and the developers say they have addressed some of the issues with the inventory/equipped items etc.)  The beautiful scenery is the real star of Salt.  The sunrise and sunset will never disappoint you, and the islands, though all fairly similar in appearance other than elevation, look nice enough.  Grass blows in the wind, fires crackle in the distance at night, and combing through a dense island at night with nothing but a dim torch to light your way can be truly haunting.  After playing the game for some time I really only have two outstanding issues I would like to bring up.  One, the enemies of Salt are the biggest nemesis of the game itself.  The graphics just seem sort of lazy and the AI is almost nonexistent.  I'm not a stickler on graphics and I love playing older games, but with the polished look that the rest of the game has you will find yourself wondering why the developers fell flat in this regard.  The other issue I want to address is the absence of other ships in the game.  While sailing you will literally never encounter anyone.  I don't mean to imply that the game should be known for ocean battles, but it would be nice to include something like a trade ship that sells supplies and upgrades for your ships, or even just friendly passersby who could give you missions and what not.\n\nMy overall rating for Salt would be 7/10\n\nIf you like adventure games where you have a minor story overview but also largely craft your own story i think you will enjoy this game.  Gathering supplies and crafting never seemed repetitive as long as I had something to gather for.  Eventually you will most likely run out of missions, but I can honestly say even though I have largely completed what the game initially had to offer I feel It was an absolute deal for the price.","July 2, 2015","true","35.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It's has superb visuals and the crafting system is simply and very easy to understand. - Aharrrr mateys! < i'm not very good at pirate talk. - Good game.","October 19, 2014","true","1.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

The graphics betray the atmosphere of this game - don't be fooled.  Remember, this is a pre-release version.  The placeholder graphics are somewhat simple or cartoony, but there is some solid game design and very good coding here.  Never had a crash or any issues with it at all - rock solid.\n\nThe exploration and survival aspects of this game are second to none.  The interface is spartan and minimal which increases the overall atmosphere of the game.  The music and scenery are gorgeous to behold.\n\nThis game also has a demo version that you can try out first.  Press "h" to learn how to manuever the interface.  Then give yourself about 10 minutes to wander about, find the chest on the island, craft a club to smash rocks and a bow and arrows to shoot fruit from the trees and at that point you'll start to understand what the game is all about.  Then craft the raft and the game really starts to shine.  Explore other islands, encounter and fight pirates, hunt animals and monsters and gear up!\n\nAgain, this game is a gem that I know I'll keep coming back to again and again.

Rip world reset later, but I can move on.\n\nPros:\n- Beautiful game.\n- Neat features like hitting trees to make fruit fall from the branches and repairing old pirate ships.\n- Added NPC vendors in huts.\n- Neat UI.\nFixed:\n- Confusion on how to open chests.\nCons:\n[Note these are likely just things in the works, I'm confident in Salt's amazing dev team!]\n- New issue, I can't figure out how to craft the pickaxe. Components involve mining I believe.\n- Sharks? Please no Stranded Deep. Comments:\n= Normal or small sized sharks are better.\n= Sharks bumping the boat/raft is fine, but when your sailboat has the physics of a beach ball and you a stone there is a problem haha. Rip SD.\n- Average combat system, making a new flare of strategy is better than hack and slash. (This hasn't bugged me too much).\n- * No Multiplayer or Co-op. I'm 100% sure this is in the dev's plans. I really hope that they can steer Salt away from the KOS boat that every other survival game floats in.\n\nI know that this is an amazing exploration game, but frankly making an island into a home would add a lot of playtime into the game. I just hope that you would have the means to find your base if you died.\n\nA cool idea: if players discover and land on an island for the first time they can name it. The more time you spend on an island the longer it will say it is claimed to you. Say Jim plays on St. George for 15 hours, and Timmy for 10 then it says Claimed by Jim. If Jim named it and he still lives there with his friend it will also be claimed by Jim and Friends. Jim just needs to be semi-active.\n\nThis game is worth the money, sale or no sale. 9/10 this survival game will one day make a 10/10.","November 27, 2015","true","1.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Salt is a great game that is getting even better and I hope to see it grow in the future!\n\nVisuals: 8.5/10\n- The art style is amazing in my opinion, it can be a bit overwhelming at first, but you'll soon love the Stranded 2-esque look of it.\n- The models in the game are not too great. Item models like bows and swords aren't the bad thing, it's mainly the Pirate models. They were improved recently, so I won't give it a worse rating for that since the models are placeholder, and don't really matter so long as the gameplay is good.\n- Could use a skybox. Doesn't currently have stars or clouds, but there is a Moon, a Sun, and little particle things floating around that adds to the great art style.\n\nOptimization: 7/10\n- As good as this game is, the optimization isn't great. After tweaking the settings a bit to adjust to my computer I found a happy medium but sometimes it's annoying that you have to turn down the settings to have a decent fps, because in this type of game, framerate and good graphics are almost a neccessity.\n\nGameplay: 9.5/10\n- Many people would complain about the combat. Which I get; the hitboxes are glitchy and enemy AI is like if you were playing tag with a 4-year-old. But this game is not about the combat. Sure, there's a few bosses and some pirates to fight, but the game doesn't focus on combat at all. So this might be a let-down for some of you, but for the people who wanted a game heavily focused on exploration and crafting, keep reading.\n- Exploration at it's finest is basically the definition of Salt. There are currently around 3-4 ships as of this review, and they all have their own purposes. Islands are infinetley generated, and you can literally adjust how fast and how far the islands spawn, and put limits on the spawn rate so that your fps can reach a stable point. There aren't any really unique biomes, except for things like sandy, grassy, foresty, and maybe a few npc houses. But each island offers a unique experience, for there might be a pirate captain waiting for you to grab his loot, or an innkeeper asking a favor, or even ancient temples.\n- The ships of Salt are simple yet satisfying. The first one is a raft which is basically a bed of logs with a small sail and an oar. The next is a small personal sailboat, which is an upgraded raft at its core, but is bigger so sometimes cant land in small spaces, and so on and so forth. You can build these boats by gathering wood and fibers, or finding one of the larger boats next to pirates and repairing it.\n- In terms of storylines, I don't know much of it. There are lore books you can find and read, and since they aren't super long and abundant like Skyrim or something, they're worth a read.\n- Progression is great in Salt. You can find Innkeepers to give quests that lead to bosses and loot. You can find different rarities of loot and enemies, and even glowing moonrock swords!\n\n\nOverall: 8.5/10\nSalt is definetly worth the price tag, and is great for exploration and adventuring.","August 16, 2015","true","18.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","7","12","2","0"

Maybe it's because so little of what you can do is documented in-game; you're constantly looking for more materials to combine to see what else you can craft - because the crafting books don't tell you everything. Or maybe it's when you realize that you can get enough equipment to be a fearsome anti-pirate. Or maybe it's just how damn pretty the game is.\n\nI found myself jotting down sextant coordinates of interesting treasure caches, merchants, or ruins. On actual paper. And using those notes to double-back at a later time to profit. Normally, I'd say that any game that forces you out-of-game to "jot down notes" is a failure. But for some reason Salt makes it work. It's refreshing not to have some kind of minimap and HUD. It's a relief to actually fight with the controls of your boat, rather than it just being a speedier version of walking. It's satisfying to plow full-speed onto a beach, hear the grind as your hull skips onto the ground, jump off of the bow and feel like the conqueror of some little patch of land.\n\nIn any event, it scratches the itch for an explore-combat-craft game without dropping itself into any major tropes, and making the "explore" part more than "walking simulator".","March 15, 2015","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dont turn this game into an RPG, just let the player feel more attached to the charecter by letting us create him/her.\n4). More Enemys! Things like Tribal Warriors awoken gods Sharks.\n5). More Hunting! things like spear fishing and hunting would be a cool addition.\n6). More passive creatures. to make the game feel more alive!\nThanks for reading through my list, adding these features would make my playing experince even more enjoyable thank it already is!

Randomly generated islands, craftable weapons, first-aid, armour, and 5 different boats to obtain and use in your travels! Not to mention the scenery and locations are amazing, even if it's not the greatest of graphics! You can hunt, fish, fight other pirates or nasty nightcrawlers, dig and unlock treasures! Even the sailing requires time, patience, and a knowledge of which way is north! This is what is feels like to be on the open seas, and Salt captures it perfectly!\n\nAll in all, if you've been look for a good pirate game ever since Pirates Online went down, then look no further! This is the game for you! The possiblities for this game are endless and amazing, and I cannot wait to see where the developers will take us next! I haven't stopped playing since I bought it!

The atmosphere is really nice with a beautiful style in day time, and a really erie style at night (stay away from islands in the dark kids!) But one complaint i have and i have with all sandbox survival games, like minecraft for example, when you have pretty much done everything, and you start over, its the same thing again, get this material and make this where you have already done that multiple times in multiple worlds. And some may say world gen would comepleatley change the experience but for me it does'nt really. The thing that makes it for me a good experience in a survival sandbox is the ammount of content the game offers, how many hours will i want to sink into this game. The reason salt is so damn good is because this, it has a good amount of content, but it feels so big because every thing takes very long to do, making the experience longer and making the player (at least for me) enjoy it  more, (if that was or was not intentional) on Lava Boot's part, Well done to them for making a really nice game!)","June 25, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Here are all the pros I have come up with:\n- Infinite world ++++\n- Easy Crafting\n- Every Island is different\n- Looting is for sure valuable and pirates always protect their precious loot\n- Pirates set up a good challenge\n- Campfires heal you if you wait\n- You can "wait" for hours or the next sunrise (like skyrim)\n\nOf course there are some cons with the game as every Early Access Game does. Here is what I've come up with:\n- Pirates can be a bit too tough, meaning make sure you have good armor and good strong weapons to destroy the pirates without dying immediately\n- Pirates can also be in a group making it extremely difficult to avoid hits and survive for long.\n- Valuable Resources can be very tedious obtaining and are rare\n\nOverall this game is great and I can only see it getting better.

If you're hesitant, at the very least throw it in your wishlist and snag it on a Steam sail... See what I did there?\n\nIf there was a genre of "relaxing survival" this would be it. It's a very chill game, with no real immediacy involved, which I actually love. It's a nice change from the dime a dozen zombie survival games out there. Since you can't starve to death, and death has no terrible penalties, it's more focused on exploration than survival. My guess is that the survival aspects will evolve as the deveopers progress with produciton.\nI love sailing around the ocean in this game, it's very calming, and to me it sparks a more visceral imagination of being on a boat, unfurling the sails and going, quite literally, wherever the wind takes you.\n\nOf course as an early access game, there's a ton missing, and I frankly won't come back to this game until they've incorporated a map. The worlds are too vast, and there's far too many islands to take on without some sort of cartography. Also, combat hitboxes need some fine tuning, it's a bit difficult to hit things as it is now.\n","December 8, 2014","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Mix up different items found and see what you can create. How many items can be created, only the adventurer (thats you) will find out. Fishing (look out for the Orange Garibaldi), building boats, weapons, medicals, tools... finding boats, weapons, medicals, tools... its all here.\n\nIf your looking for a game of exploration, open world, creativity. It is right here.\n\nIt is a game that requires patience, and steady progress in terms of building your inventory of equipment.. take your time to see what items you can create, look for abandon pirate ships to repair, keep and decorate.. going straight for the pirates from the off, is just suicide and they will trounce your hind immediately. The captains are even harder (har-harrr, pirate impression gone wrong me thinks). (REMEMBER TO SAVE)\n\nHowever, there is so much advenutre and discovery to be done, your searching for items to craft adds tons of excitment and before you know it you'll be chinning bad guys in ernest and no pirate will me laughing at the Masters of Quack-fu.\n10/10.\nBring on the Trumpets!!...I mean the completed game","July 10, 2015","true","74.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

But don't let that deter you, if you love ocean exploration and don't mind meh graphics buy this game.\n\nSome things I would like to see added to this game:\n\nLarge land masses, they could have small castles or towns, or have underground dungeons, to keep the sense of exploration alive. Just going from island to island killing pirates and picking up logs is going to get boring after a while, and I don't mean entire continents, just something larger than the usual as seen in the game.\n\nRoaming enemy ships, how cool would it be to come across a pirate ship, and board it, killing all the pirates and taking the loot. Pretty cool.\n\nA crew/companions, to help with fighting. And boarding enemy ships would be much even better with people to help you.\n\nOther threats at sea: Maybe storms, sharks and squids, and maybe even a kraken boss if you sail out far enough.\n\nDiving: You know whats better than exploring the ocean surface?

Between making a new boat, foraging for food, fending off pirates, and sailing off into the sunset, I have had hours fly by with ease before I even notice its happened. There isnt any building or magic or anything like that, the game is actually rather simple. It focuses solely on the exploration factor, with a small part on combat and "survival". Theres money and some merchants, ruins and ancient relics, pirates and giant spiders galore, but the primary focus on the game is sailing into the distance and finding new lands to explore. Honestly my only two issues so far are that the music does not play nearly often enough and that there isnt enough to do while sailing. These are seriously minor complaints and do not detract from the value of the experience as a whole, but they have to be said. The music is atmospheric and beautiful, but it rarely pops up. And sure, you can fish or manage your inventory while sailing, but if you want to go off into the wild blue yonder in a small sailing boat against the wind....youll be sitting there for a while. It would be nice to have some crafting or smelting or something to do during that time. Maybe charting a map or a captains log to fill out, something that fits the theme. Either way, it is still a truly wonderful experience and sometimes just sailing in itself passes the time. It isnt finished, but what it is has enough potential to make it easily one of the best exploration games of its genre. Honestly, the only reason I dont have 50+ hours dumped into the game by now is because I get so absorbed into each time I play it that I have to limit myself from playing on days I have to work, else I risk losing hours of time without realizing it! Definitely recommended, 10/10, gold star, thumbs up, etc etc.","January 10, 2015","true","14.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

You can make it anything you want; exiting or just meditational (yesterday I tried to fight a large spider, got frightened; there were many more on the small small island, and i was already nearly dead, so i quickly sailed away and went on exploring the vast ocean and more friendly islands). Also nice graphics (even on the lowest level; my computer is not at the recommended settings, but still the game runs smoothly, though I do think it may make it somewhat more easy since stuff is easier to see at low graphics; logs etc. are not caught up in the grass...).

So, for the sake of it, here's a pros and cons list\nPROS\n+The game has a good artstyle. It looks good.\n+The water looks great, it really does.\n+Boats. Boats are love, boats are life\n+There is a huge, infinite ocean to explore\n+You're a pirate, and you kill pirates.\n+The music is great\n+You can kill giant spiders\n+Its a very unique game\n+Its quite calming\nCONS\n-Combat is really dull\n-The game needs a better tutorial\n-Some really low resolution textures\n\nAlso, on a side note. Most EA games don't have much content, only enough for maybe 3 hours. Salt, on the other hand, seems like it has around 20 hours of fun. Granted, I wont be playing it for that long, but just keep that in mind.\n\nAlso note, the combat is really bad. You take a swing, you hit, he takes a swing, you block. Its really the weakest point of the game, and as you'll end up doing it a lot, just keep that in mind.","January 3, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/weilard/recommended/327860/","weilard","Weilard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/weilard/","1061 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nРедкий симулятор выживания предлагает своему посетителю что-либо кроме самого выживания. Задачи в играх такого плана довольно просты. Набить брюхо, выспаться, чтобы найти чем набить брюхо перед следующей спячкой. Знакомство с большинством из них рано или поздно ставит перед выбором – чем себя занять? Либо построить красивый дом, либо водрузить на крышу лачуги акулу, либо вырезать всех мирных игроков, которые строят что-то вокруг, а затем наслаждаться воплями ограбленных и обездоленных вашими загребущими руками, в том случае, если симулятор выживания предполагает избиение невинных.\n\nПриобретая «Salt» я думал, что это еще один такой симулятор. Что я научусь делать мечи и кирки, пробурю пару ходов, построю себе землянку и буду жить подобно медведю – набивая брюхо и впадая в сезонную спячку. Я ошибался. Точно также я ошибся, когда глядя на скриншоты подумал - «вероятно, игру делал программист». Ошибки уже давно вошли в привычку, ибо вкус безнадежно испорчен клонами одной и той же игровой механики «найди десяток бананов и собери пистолет». Целый сегмент индустрии эксплуатирует жанр «выживания» точно также как до этого эксплуатировали казуальные игры класса «найди пять бананов».\n\nОднако оставим стручки стручкоедам. Оказавшись в игре, я резво пробежал по острову и собрал нехитрую снедь, которой оказалось достаточно, чтобы собрать утлый плот с небольшим парусом, на котором я незамедлительно отправился в плаванье. Начнем его и мы с вами, и проплывем по перечислению того, что дает эта игра в отличие от других подобных ей.\n\nМоре? Море. Оно волнуется и перекатывается. Есть высота волн, и движение судна по ним. Это выгодно отличает «Salt» от «Stranded Deep» (как наиболее близкий по тематике) где движение происходит по одной плоскости. У вашего судна есть руль, который позволяет управлять кораблем. Вы можете передвигаться по плоту или судну во время движения не опасаясь, что каким-либо багом вас сметет прочь.\nСойдя на землю, вы можете невзначай выяснить, что флора и фауна на разных островах различаются. Что на островах есть сундуки, пираты, капища и другие секреты. Что на них, как ни странно есть другие люди, и не все из них норовят выпустить вам кишки. О да, здесь можно поболтать и получить квесты. Что второй лук или еще один меч, что вы нашли это не такой же объект, и что у него есть свойства. Что описаны лишь базовые элементы крафта, а остальные вы найдете сами… в книгах. Недурно, не правда ли? Кто бы ожидал этого от маленькой и цветастой игры.\n\nИ вот я уже несусь между островами осмысленно, ведомый выданным мне заданием. Попутно обнаруживаю разбитый корабль, который можно починить, в трюме «компас, что не указывает на север». Книги, в которых полностью или частично описаны предметы, которые я могу собрать. Описаны не как список предметов, которые дадут другой предмет. Нет. Это настоящие книжки. Дневники пиратов. Схемы написанные кем-то. Мемуары скитальцев. Каждый остров может таить в себе секрет. Каждый остров может и будет отличаться. Каждый остров не будет спрайтом на горизонте как в «Stranded Deep», который затем заменится на совершенно другой остров, делая навигацию не то чтобы не нужной, но невозможной. Нет. Здесь всё по-честному – какой остров увидел, такой формы он и будет когда вы подплывете. Это позволит вам плыть на глазок. По памяти. Ну а если глазок хромоват – существует секстант. Да и блокнот на столе, с ручкой и координатами в нем никто не отменял.\n\nГрафика, когда вы уже в игре, не кажется работой программиста. Это некий минимализм. На пределе. Он уместен. Он к месту. Он самодостаточен.\n\nВы когда-нибудь охотились в симуляторах выживания? Чаще зверь это невероятно тупая тушка, которая стоит на месте и ожидает, когда её превратят в гамбургер. Куда реже это тушка, которая делает вид что удирает, но будучи медленной от рождения всё равно попадает к вам на обед. Ещё реже вам приходиться гоняться за дичью, загоняя её и думая с какой стороны напасть так чтобы зверь не ушел. Это тот самый редкий случай.\n\nСимулятор... симулятор выживания? О чем это он? И верно. О чем это я? Все мы знаем, что частенько разработчики добавляют своему проекту разные теги. Adventure, или RPG. Даже если игра содержит лишь их куцые элементы. Эта игра ещё не рпг, но стремится к этому. И это абсолютно точно - приключение. Не в поисках банки тушенки. Не в поисках кого бы ограбить. Нет. Это настоящая игра про пиратов, море и клады.","April 1, 2015","true","7.4"," 21 of 42 people (50%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","50","21","42","12","0"

It is described as action and adventure, but it lacks that majorly. The only adventure is traveling between islands that are practically replicas of each other. Also, the only "survival" aspect in this game is hunger. It poses no challenge whatsoever.\n\nTL;DR - Unless you want a mind-numbingly slow game, do not purchase this.

Making a freely available demo is probably one of the smartest moves I've seen in a while from a small developer, as experiencing the gameplay turned my 'maybe' into a sale.\n\nThe developers are incredibly responsive within the Steam discussion forum and listen to player input and suggestions. They do not seem to be trying to cash in and genuinely want to make a fun game for people to play. I wish more developers would follow in their style.\n\nAs far as the gameplay, it's a 'light' survival game with great colors and scenery. Sailing is an element which in my opinion is underutilized and the random generation of islands provides great potential.\n\n'Great Potential' is essentially how I would summarize this game currently. Since the world is randomly generated from a seed it can be rather expansive but right now content and gameplay components may be found to be somewhat thin. I feel this is due to the true 'early access' nature of the title as new content comes with nearly every patch.\n\nIf you're curious at all about a survival and exploration game set in a beautiful environment, check out the demo. Check out the discussion forums. I suspect you'll purchase once you experience a taste of Salt.","November 15, 2014","true","13.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Actually has the core element of most survival games : figuring it out for yourself. It's not a big game, so there isn't a wiki full of information on it. You have to learn your way through the books and survival guides that pirates drop ingame. Already worked my way up from a raft to a large pirate ship (one sail), and I'm island hopping trying to get pieces for the "PardonPusher". Great experience so far, awesome adventure.","November 26, 2014","true","12.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It even has some longer term goals to achieve.\n\nSalt is definitely a much more fleshed out survival game than other early access games out there, it has a lot of items and doesn't limit its gameplay with realistic constraints.\n\nUnfortunately, any real further character development gets cut short after some 10 hours. While there's still things to do it is stretched too far, too thin, and the base gameplay does eventually get tiresome - Why can't I just cut down a bunch of trees for my logs? Why can't I build a mansion with the gajillion stone I have?","March 5, 2015","true","13.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You'll find yourself darting island to island Gathering, Looting and Killing to upgrade your Tools, Weapons and Armor. The game does get somewhat repettitive (from what ive played of the game) but grinding up to cool new weapons and rare armor works as a neat incentive.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPositives: 1: Sailing. Big boat or small, manning a ship and sailing it island to island is amazing. Not to mention sprinting\nand jumping off your ships deck onto an island and charging into a pirate camp with your ship full\nmast, sailing into the distance, is even more amazing.\n\n2: Customisable Ships. With smaller ships you can throw some torches for extra light, or storage crates. For\nbigger ships you can put up weapon plaques, chests, fire pits and even a bed.\n\n3: Armor/Tools/Weapons. There are an expansive variety of different armors, tools and weapons, all with\ndifferent uses and buffs to suit what you want. Most noticable are armor set\nbonuses that can give out extra sailing or movment speeds.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNegatives: 1: 'Boat Menu'. As you work throught the game there are several different vessels you can craft, however\nwhen you eventually craft a boat its saved to your 'Boat Menu'. After that, they pretty much\nwork as summonable mounts, useable at any time. Allthough its not a major issue, I feel like it\nbreaks the immersion of the game.\n\n2: No death penalty. From what i've seen, theres no real death penalty with a regular playthrough and with\nthe mentioned Boat Menu theres no real detterant to staying alive.  There is a Hardcore\nsetting for this game, so for now it has some optional difficulty curve.\n\n3:Bottomless Inventory. Once again, as far as i've played there is no restrictions to how many items you can\ncarry. Besides the point of having too much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t clogging up your inventory,\nthe storage crates and chests and not much use.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExpectations: 1: Misc Customisation. I would love to be able to stick down flagposts with a sigil and colors that i've\npicked out to represent my character, More of a finished product thing, but would\nstill be great.\n\n2: Additional Fauna: Im enjoying hunting down deer with my bow and arrow, though it would be nice to see\nsome other smaller or larger game to hunt.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlmost all my points are subject to change at this point in time, but I strongly urge people to give it a go. Its not too bad\nfor $15.00 and it will be great to see some of the additions and alterations they make in later patches.\n\n- Skedar","March 25, 2015","true","16.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Can't wait to see how this will develop over time. Already well worth the money\n\nSurvival is a lot less dramatic as compared other games, just need to eat every couple of in game hours depending on your playstyle.

Playing other games and trying to find a reason to play this one was limited. Going into the world and thinking you have the ability to forage is very limited in itself. Special objects are placed in the world for stone and so on, mining into a cliff isn't possible, look for a node (object) shaded the same color randomly laying around as the exposed cliff to mine with a pickaxe or in the earlier part of the game a club. Need wood? I would think cutting a tree down (which there are an abundance of trees on the islands) would give you some but that isn't possible, looking for wood chunks on the ground is the way it works, just run around the island and pick them up. Its a neat game, just wish it was structured differently. If you are between the ages of 12-16 or need something simple to play, this should keep you busy.","January 8, 2015","false","1.0"," 31 of 65 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","31","65","0","6"

It's not done. Whatever. I recommend this game IF you are wanting to pass some time, maybe wait for Steam to download something else and not suck up bandwidth playing a game.\n\nTl;dR It's a great time waster if you're into exploration and open worlds and ships and stuff. Plus you can act like a pirate. Arr.\n\nPROS:\n- Relaxing! It's a really low stress game. My heart rate climbed above 30bpm only when there were pirates rushing at me with axes. I almost had a heart attack.\n\n- Fun! It's actually pretty fun if you're into exploring and open worlds. The map (I believe) is endless, with random generated islands always coming up on the horizon at some point. You actually do get a small sense of discovery and it's just as intense as Capt. Picard discovering a new planet, or a cheap street walker discovering a new wart in her nether regions.\n\n- Deep(ish/er than I thought it would be)  crafting system. If you don't look up recipes on a guide, it can be mildly entertaining to experiment on things! Also, it's a good way to pass time when sailing between islands, sail time can be long.\n\n- Interesting loot. I actually found myself scouring islands mainly for better weapons and armor, and was surprised at the level of bonuses and whatnot that the devs have put in the game. I wasn't expecting passive skills on different stuff, and armor sets, it was unexpected and interesting trying to find all the pieces of a specific set. It's basically Skyrim on steroids but when i say that I mean after it grows lady lumps and stops and becomes a scrawny chicken man again. So no, it's not Skyrim but it's better than I thought.\n\n- Interesting islands. Scouring for resources on islands and searching for pirate bases and especially traders and treasure hunter islands was a great time waster while I waited for Elder Scrolls Online to take 20 ♥♥♥♥ING HOURS TO DOWNLOAD.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Early access! It's buggy sometimes. It'll still have a ways to go. But it's entirely playable in it's current state so you can't knock it TOO much here. Unlike DayZ which is STILL BUGGY as HELL.\n\n- Graphics. They aren't for everyone. Myself personally it doesn't bug me that they're pretty dated graphics, but to some people they'll be turned off.\n\n- Repetition. Repetition. The game is basically the same thing over and over. Basically it's the same gameplay repeated. It's pretty much the same objectives repeatedly. You'll find yourself doing the same thing over and over. There isn't much variety in the gameplay, it kind of repeats itself a lot. HOWEVER. You WILL have a purpose generally, especially if you're trying to follow the questline, or collect supplies for certain in-game items that are pretty impressive that require mass amounts of supplies to inherit...almost kind of a spoiler what you can find, so i won't ruin it. It was cool discovering one for the first time.\n\n- Pirate AI - Garbage. Might change with early access, but the AI is heinously bad.\n\nOverall, Salt basically boils down to one word. Mild. The game is mildly entertaining, mildly exciting, and mildly deeper than i thought it would be. It's great for playing to pass time while waiting for another longer download if you don't wanna use bandwidth and for just passing the time exploring.\n\n7/10 would Jack Sparrow again","June 17, 2015","true","8.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You bump into lots of Salt everywhere you look, it's all over the place.  Salt on the beaches, salt on the water or in the water, salt on the craft raft, salt in the air, and salt in your hair.  Salt in places you'd just never care!\n\nI like that this game is very simple and relaxing to play, sometimes I enjoy playing the game without wearing any pants.  I'm speaking for myself sitting on the couch, not my character.  So far I don't know if he has found pants yet either.  So if you think about it we could coexist in some sort of parallel universe and never even possess the realization of this uncanny miracle.\n\nOnce you craft the basic things you need to explore and defend yourself it's pretty relaxing and cool to play.  I don't like to fight the lego looking pirates without getting at least 1 shot off with the bow.  They grunt like my former college roommate when he used have sex with tank ♥♥♥ the redhead with a huge butt that resembled a shelf.  you could place decorations or plants on that thing.  it was non structural but it was load bearing enough to handle light storage.\n\nThe part of the game that makes me ornery is the raft placement and steering, this thing just doesn't cooperate at 1st.  Even at sea it's very tricky and sensitive.  It reminds me of Tom Hanks in BIG.  He was very lost at the time and upset with the decision he made, and you probably think i'm jumbled and should have written Castaway...no that's a farse.\n\nThe 9th Pirates of the Caribbean movie featured several islands from this game.  The island of Sloar is infamous for Pirate raids and Treasure troves of chests just ripe for the looting.  The Pirates from Salt do not look anything like Jack Sparrow but they walk just as if they are more intoxicated.  I like their style.  this game is cool\n","July 30, 2015","true","1.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","2","2","0"

OK to describe the combat system.\nyou can have a few types of weapons, bows, one handed swords/handaxes, (i think) and two handed swords/axes.\nok so it works like this, the player/AI with the most health and damage wins, or if you cheez the AI then you'll win to. ehhhh, that is not a good systeam, and those damn pirate leaders! Are so unfairly powerfull.\nso the game needs to be more interesting. like... a quest where you need to go to an island, on this said island the is a castle. The story goes that who ever sets foot on that i island never returned. So the player go to the island to investigate on arival the player can hear a loud and might roar. and then strange things happen. He finds treasures people, and... the castle. When the player enters the castle he/she can hear snoring sounds from some where deep in the castle. When the player gets to the source, the player finds themselves in a dragon lair and a dragon is faceing them. now they are faced with the task of beating/killing this dragon. After they have successfully beat/killed the dragon they find an egg the player then has 3 options, take the egg, leave it, or destroy it. if the player takes the egg he/she needs to raise the dragon when the egg hatches and watch as it grows. (maybe even ride it, maybe being able to talk to it when it gets older teach it how to talk maybe?) the other options basically dose the same thing you just don't have the egg or dragon. now, that is just a message to the developer that. that would be interesting, i think this game is good at giving you the sense of adventure it's just every thing around that is not that good like sea battles. That would have been awesome(if they add it that is) or fighting a sea dragon, seeing mermaids. A town would be great where you can upgrade your shipe and get jobs. All that cool stuff so can i recommend it. well for me. Am going to have to say no i can't but this game is some where in the middle for right now, but it can be great am waiting for the developers to suprise me with a cool update.

But every minute was a chore. The glaring colors didn't jive, despite them trying to make it look tropical and warm/bright. The whole GUI and HUD are a complete mystery, along with the controls- especially since they didn't use typical controls for a pc game like this. There's not even a click and drag from inventory to the hotbar. What game EVER doesn't have a click/drag, or an easy way to move about items when the WHOLE GAME is about scavenging items. And sometimes you gotta run over items to pick them up and other times you have to use E and sometimes you gotta stab at stuff...I don't want a guessing game. Are you *trying* to anger your players?\n\nAfter what felt like a hellish lifetime of playing, scouring not only their 'instruction manuals' but their oddly placed control/more instruction manuals in their pause menu, I STILL couldn't find out how to put things in the hotbar. I've had an easier time figuring out a mmorpg.\n\nAnd the story. The story is just no good. It felt...let's politely use the words tired, strained and boring. It gave me zero motivation to do anything- no, it actually gave me negative motivation. When you make a game, you go into it with a *writer* in the team, if you are going to include story. And by writer, I mean someone who is creative and somewhat skilled in the art. Narrative is something you need to build up and finesse. Not just slap the first thing you think of on paper when you think of the ocean. (spoilers, I'm talking pirates)\n\nReal talk here, I would have more fun reading a car manual aloud to kindergarteners.\n\nIt really felt like they were trying *too* hard to set themselves apart from other open world games, like Minecraft and such. The controls and crafting were just...barely functional. Like a termite infested peg leg. Oh and golly gee, if you're trying to not be Minecraft, don't make the peoples' anatomy look so much like their model. I thought herobrine was chasing me down the beach. If you want exploration, crafting, open world, survival, narrative (or at least just cohesive context)....fun....there are MUCH better early access games out in the market.\n\nUgh.\nLet's just say this game made me...Salty.\nAnd I most certainly wouldn't be if this game wasn't so expensive, the reviews weren't mostly positive or the preview video showed only a small fraction of the gameplay that looked adventurous and appealing, when the reality of it is...just not that. I seriously feel offended as an artist/writer, and cheated as a gamer.\nThis game is literally BARELY playable. And even at that, only if you feel like punishing yourself.\n\n...I'm getting my money back.","December 24, 2015","false","1.4"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","4","11","2","0"

There's not a whole lot to do. I found myself mostly just wandering around the islands picking up every log and flower I could find. When I first started, I made a small boat, only to have immediately dissapear, taking my resources with it. I found out I didn't even need a boat, as I could just walk through the water to other oceans. With that being said, I think it's got loads of potential, and I do look forward to seeing how it progresses. But I think until a few updates, i've just spent 15 bucks on a game that's going to sit there and not be touched.","March 1, 2015","false","1.2"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","2"

And the traders... well they will be f*cking impossible to find after a while... like seriously... they are so hard to find that you can hardly believe that there are traders in this stupid game... that was one of the reasons i stopped playing this game... Plus you find empty ships you can repair and make them your property... but when you want other types of ships in this game... because there are a lot of other types of ships in this game that have other types of functional things... it's just unbelievably weird that someone would just abandon them like that... oh yeah... no-one other than the player him or her-self ride ships in his game -_- ... so boring.\n\nAnd the spiders that are the only monsters in this game... they are more disturbing and irritating than exciting and scary enemies... So if you want a better pirate-game with enemies that aren't so stupid so clocks stops ticking, then i reccomend you to buy the film-license Pirates of the caribbean: the end of the world... or minecraft maybe? I don't know... but please don't do the mistake i did... to buy this game. 4/10.","March 13","false","15.4"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

I didn't play for too long but I can tell from expierience it needs a lot of work. Ok so the graphics absolutely suck, but it somehow still manages to be laggy on my high-RAM PC. The water just sits there but there's still wave sounds, which destroys the immersion. The raft controls are really weird and hard to use. I found some pirates on an island (they look like something out of roblox), and the combat is like minecraft only 3 times as bad. Boring, mind-numbing, and skill-less combat. The other islands seem pretty much alike, with nothing too exciting on them. The sound effects sound like comeplete crap. You can hear the same bird noise over and over, even though there are no birds in sight. You can even hear the sounds starting and stopping. You can't go in the water or swim. This game COULD be good, if they changed and improved a long list of things, but in it's current state I can't reccomend you spend money on it.","May 27","false","0.4"," 5 of 22 people (23%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","23","5","22","4","2"

Banishment to an island was a bit harsh.  Still, they left me a chest of items I can use to create a raft and I found the pickaxe they left lying around.  Time to go exploring...\n\nSalt is not for those wanting instant gratification - it takes a long time to build up to owning that pirate ship of your dreams - and that means a lot (and I mean a LOT) of running around islands looking for resources.  The scenery is beautiful, the occasional bird singing in the trees as the sun shines down.  A lovely gentle game Salt.\n\nWell, I guess hunting deer with your bow and arrow isn't exactly gentle, fun though.  And then there's the spiders.  And the pirates.  And the really tough pirates.  And the really big momma spider - phew she's scary (I decided I'd rather go swimming than get et by her [and swimming isn't a good idea in Salt]). Oh, and the pirate captains and the huge stone throwing living statues.  But apart from them.\n\nWell, the sailing and the fishing is peaceful...","January 31, 2015","true","140.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With this raft, you can sail to a multitude of other islands and survive by hunting deer, knocking apples out of trees, fishing, or looting the inevitable Pirates that you will stumble upon.  You can make (or find and repair) larger boats as you gain supplies, and you can customize these boats with beds, crates, chests, torches for lighting, and even paintings.\n\nThe most fun I've had in a survival game in a long while!  Minecraft had some of the most primitive graphics but it was a ton of fun because you were able to mold the world to your liking.  In this game, you may not be able to mold the world like in Minecraft, but the world itself is so large (possibly infinite) that you will never run out of places to explore and things to do.  My favorite part so far has been to sail around islands to scope them out, then land at ones that I think have pirate villages and systematically wipe out the pirate population and take their treasure.\n\nThere are bosses in this game that you have to watch out for too - and vendors that you can find that will give you quests!  For an early access game, this one is definitely worth the price.  I have already gotten $15 of fun from it!  If open world survival games appeal to you, I'd definitely recommend this one.  And since they have a free demo, there's no reason not to try it.","January 8, 2015","true","18.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game places no expectation or urgency whatsoever on the player in terms of goals, missions, objectives, etc., instead providing those gameplay features and allowing the player to pursue them or ignore them entirely. Playing this game is supremely relaxing, personally reminding me of summers spent sailing the seas of Wind Waker. Only the bare minimum of direction or guidance is provided, which is a true rarity among today's games dominated by quest arrows and nagging tutorials (and yes, I realize most of those options can be disabled in many modern games, but still...). The sense of wonder of exploration and adventure has stayed very fresh in this game and I'm looking forward to many more hours put in. And finally, if you've ever wanted a game in which you can do nothing besides scavenge fallen wood, mine for rock and gems, shoot apples out of trees with a bow and arrow, and hunt dastardly fast yet ungainly deer, well maybe you will discover as I have that this is your game!","January 4, 2015","true","68.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Usually, I am hesitant about buying into an early access game, having gotten burned myself when devs would all but take the money and run. However, Salt is an early access gem, and I personally feel that this game will achieve huge things in the future.\n\nThe magic of Salt is it's atmosphere. Looking at the sun through a bamboo thicket and seeing the shadows stream through to the ground, wistfully shifting back and forth as the trees sway in the breeze. The way the ambient environmental sounds change as you travel from a beach into the inner part of an island. A quiet sunset that turns the sky a bright red hue. This game is dripping with cool scenery, and the Wind Waker-esque visuals really help it's case.\n\nOh, and speaking of Wind-Waker, Salt's gameplay reminds me of that game's wonderful open world sailing, mixed with (for those of you who are old enough to remember) exploring the island of Myst. But don't worry, there aren't any annoying puzzles. Salt is purely about achieving open world zen through gentle, thoughtful exploration.\n\nI've sailed to many islands in my short time with Salt, and I have to say that the procedural generation is amazing. Every island I've visited has been unique. Never have I seen a cookie cutter layout, or one of those Diablo 3 style map-is-the-same-but-ever-so-slightly-changed scenarios.\n\nI feel that one of the reviewers here on Steam said it best when he likened playing Salt to the first time you fired up Morrowind. Like, "WHOA. I've got this entire alternate world open to me?!" It's that excited feeling you would get as a kid, entering into a fantasy world where you could just simply be. That feeling is one that Salt has in spades.\n\nHighly recommended.","December 12, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's difficult to get too far into the game though...the A.I. navigation gives me nightmares about the human grunts from Half-Life, and the fact that the enemies turn into greater damage sponges makes the combat feel only as challenging as the A.I. decides it wants to jerk left and right while trying to make it's way towards you. A good portion of the time, arrows seem to go through the NPCs...I could swear they do, at least. I've shot some of them dead-on and seen nothing happen to the NPC, besides them becoming aware of my presense.\n\nDemo did exactly what it needed to for this game. Without it, I probably wouldn't have bothered with checking out the game. Beyond the A.I. issues, this is the kind of exploration that survival games should be aiming for.","December 12, 2014","true","27.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

An open world survival game\n\nThis game isnt finished yet but damn its good. There are basically no glitches from what i have seen so far, the randomly spawned islands are great how ever the first couple i wen't to nothing really spawned. The ships you can craft are really nice. There are 4 ships you can craft from a small raft to a apirate ship, these are good but maybe a few more should be added to give more of a choice, also the ships can be customized as well witch is a great thing. From how it looks thats really a personal thing but we can all agree that the lighting is amazing, it runs smoothly and since its nor finished i am exited to see what the future of this game holds. Things that need to be there or need in proving: a 3rd person or HUD view to see your person with the different armors there are, the spawning of plants to be a little better since some spawned in the air on hills or on smaller hills & well thats it really i can't think or any major bad things that people won't like apart from you can't build your own home/fort and its not multiplayer. I almost forgot you can but or sell things with traders on islands plus you can find tressure hunters and find tressure for them and they reward you.\n\nThis is a really good game and i recommend this game to anybody who likes sirvival or sailing or fighting pirates and adventure. 10/20 from me.","March 28, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(You are going to have to do some trial and error when crafting things.)\n\nThe game itself is great because the point is to find and acquire items so as to defeat pirates and captains; and ultimately, deal with ancient ruins and such that come later in the game.  It's paced a little slower than some may like, but that's the point.\n\nI enjoy the game because it's laid back and I can unwind.

The execution could use a little pick me up.  That being said, this is a short, sweet adn to the point review.\n\nIts a fun game I played for about 14-15 hours and took a break, yet to go back again, I might though.  It's but it has little in the way of things to do after you see the first 20 or so islands.\n\nPros:\n\n*It doesn't crash.  EVER.  thats always a plus.\n*It allows you to sail an open sea and control your boats in ways that no other game other than Zelda The Wind Waker has.  Complete open world, non linear navigation.\n*The exploration aspect is pretty fun\n\nCons\n*The AI could use a re write, When running from Aggro pirates when you hit water, they run away.\n*It is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to find wood, as you cannot cut down any of the hundreds of trees on any given island...  IDK, but to me its not a true survival game if you cannot lop a tree down with an axe.\n*The gameplay ATM is limited, I would LOVE to see more AI in the game, Maybe but not limited to:\n-Other boats on the seas\n-Native VIllages to conquer or befriend\n-Forts, towns, and docks to Conquer or befriend\n-Definitely more than 5 Ship Types, because as it stands the player can ONLY create two when you start, a little Sail raft, and a slightly less little Sail boat.  If you are lucky adn have a CRAPTON of materials, which took me 4 or 5 hours to get, you will stumble upon a wrecked Pirate ship which is considerably larger than your little pontoon boat with a sail.  and two others which one is obtained by completeing a quest, the other by killing named pirates and collecting the parts..  None of which I have obtained yet.\n- ALL of the ships are EXACTLY the same speed, I would think that a Pontoon with a sail, would be considerably faster than a Raft.  And a massive Pirate ship would be faster than a single masted Pontoon.  Which brings me to my next con.\n- The pirate ship only has ONE sail, the type of Ship it is modeled after is a caraval should have at LEAST three Sails, Two Square sails, one being the Main Sail, the other being the Fore Sail, adn the third Sail being the Lanteen, or the Triangular sail attatched to the Boom at the Bow of the ship.  Instead it has one sail plopped in the middle, looks a bti tacky to me.\n\n\nALl in all, it was a fun half day spent on this game, but as it stands right now, I don't see much more fun out of it in its current state, but still if you are a Sail Boat Enthusiest, like myself, or just want to take to the open wave this game be good for ye'\n\n\n-Adam C Morrissette.","February 12, 2015","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But, my one disappointment of this game is that even at the lowest graphics, I can still only manage to get 15 fps max. I can run TF2 at 60 fps steady, and with this games rather simple (but charming) graphics I dont see why it is so resource intensive. With a bit of optimization, this truly has the makings to be a great little survival game. Seeing how updates seem to be rather steady, I assume it wont take long for those optimizations to come out.","April 16, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The execution could use a little pick me up.  That being said, this is a short, sweet adn to the point review.\n\nIts a fun game I played for about 14-15 hours and took a break, yet to go back again, I might though.  It's but it has little in the way of things to do after you see the first 20 or so islands.\n\nPros:\n\n*It doesn't crash.  EVER.  thats always a plus.\n*It allows you to sail an open sea and control your boats in ways that no other game other than Zelda The Wind Waker has.  Complete open world, non linear navigation.\n*The exploration aspect is pretty fun\n\nCons\n*The AI could use a re write, When running from Aggro pirates when you hit water, they run away.\n*It is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to find wood, as you cannot cut down any of the hundreds of trees on any given island...  IDK, but to me its not a true survival game if you cannot lop a tree down with an axe.\n*The gameplay ATM is limited, I would LOVE to see more AI in the game, Maybe but not limited to:\n-Other boats on the seas\n-Native VIllages to conquer or befriend\n-Forts, towns, and docks to Conquer or befriend\n-Definitely more than 5 Ship Types, because as it stands the player can ONLY create two when you start, a little Sail raft, and a slightly less little Sail boat.  If you are lucky adn have a CRAPTON of materials, which took me 4 or 5 hours to get, you will stumble upon a wrecked Pirate ship which is considerably larger than your little pontoon boat with a sail.  and two others which one is obtained by completeing a quest, the other by killing named pirates and collecting the parts..  None of which I have obtained yet.\n- ALL of the ships are EXACTLY the same speed, I would think that a Pontoon with a sail, would be considerably faster than a Raft.  And a massive Pirate ship would be faster than a single masted Pontoon.  Which brings me to my next con.\n- The pirate ship only has ONE sail, the type of Ship it is modeled after is a caraval should have at LEAST three Sails, Two Square sails, one being the Main Sail, the other being the Fore Sail, adn the third Sail being the Lanteen, or the Triangular sail attatched to the Boom at the Bow of the ship.  Instead it has one sail plopped in the middle, looks a bti tacky to me.\n\n\nALl in all, it was a fun half day spent on this game, but as it stands right now, I don't see much more fun out of it in its current state, but still if you are a Sail Boat Enthusiest, like myself, or just want to take to the open wave this game be good for ye'\n\n\n-Adam C Morrissette.","February 12, 2015","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I fully enjoy it through and through, keep in mind this is in early acess still, its got a lot to do as it stands. I will say that I don't think it's for everyone though, the game is a much slower paced than most of its type. Mainly the reason is because you spend time sailing between islands, I personally love this. I sail at night, and fish at night, and explore during the day.\n\nI like how the game has multiple ways of crafting things, so you're not confined to doing it one way. Don't like spiders? Just get the better plant fibers, and the same goes for wood and stone. As of yet it can be somewhat frustrating to find resources because you can't just chop a tree down, and not every rock you see can be mined. So this can cause some frustration, but if you're me, and enjoy a bit of challenge to scrounge for resources then this is just for you.\n\nThe sea voyages can be lengthy if so choose and its nice, it gives you time to craft, fish and navigate. The game's features are ever expanding as this is early access so everything I love will only get better from here on out, for its price tag I fully recommend it. I got this on sale and even at its full price tag its worth it, so just buy it and enjoy slaying pirates, hunting deer, and sailing into the sunset.","January 4, 2015","true","98.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Salt has great atmosphere that's reinforced by it's awesome music and stunning visuals. You get to explore an expansive ocean with various types of islands that are home to a plethora of enemies. Survival really seems to be a non priority and there are no real consequences for not feeding yourself. I have to say I enjoy that. I'm sick of survival games where I need to eat every five minutes real time. They're unrealistic and annoying. The current state of the world is lonely and I'd love to see larger npc settlements or other inhabited vessels. Combat and the GUI both need some love (So does controller support but we'll pretend I didn’t say that as it's blasphemy) but I expect they'll get it in time. Please add hot keys for weapons and tools. I'd like to see some more music added even if it's more ambient because sailing long distances early game is too quiet. Part of me wishes for a leveling system also. That may conflict with the core design philosophy though. Oh well. Some textures look great while others are what I assume to be place holders. I really expect the game to get a graphical update once Unity 5 comes out. No more blow-up doll pirates maybe? Once the game is fully fleshed out and multiplayer is added it'll be a real gem especially if they add things like naval combat. All in all Salt is an already really promising exploration/role playing game with a ton of content and no major flaws (for an early access)for the price and it definitely deserves your support.","March 24, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game places no expectation or urgency whatsoever on the player in terms of goals, missions, objectives, etc., instead providing those gameplay features and allowing the player to pursue them or ignore them entirely. Playing this game is supremely relaxing, personally reminding me of summers spent sailing the seas of Wind Waker. Only the bare minimum of direction or guidance is provided, which is a true rarity among today's games dominated by quest arrows and nagging tutorials (and yes, I realize most of those options can be disabled in many modern games, but still...). The sense of wonder of exploration and adventure has stayed very fresh in this game and I'm looking forward to many more hours put in. And finally, if you've ever wanted a game in which you can do nothing besides scavenge fallen wood, mine for rock and gems, shoot apples out of trees with a bow and arrow, and hunt dastardly fast yet ungainly deer, well maybe you will discover as I have that this is your game!","January 4, 2015","true","68.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Salt is pretty much like the Wind Waker, mixed with MineCraft, with a touch of survival elements. The amount of things you can do in this game depends on how patient you are, but I have seen most of the creations you can build and putting in the extra time will pay off in the end. Piirate ships abound, sailing the sea has never been so addicting, and relaxing. If you love Pirates, and enjoyed the sailing in Wind Waker, you will most likely have a soft spot for Salt.","July 8, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I fully enjoy it through and through, keep in mind this is in early acess still, its got a lot to do as it stands. I will say that I don't think it's for everyone though, the game is a much slower paced than most of its type. Mainly the reason is because you spend time sailing between islands, I personally love this. I sail at night, and fish at night, and explore during the day.\n\nI like how the game has multiple ways of crafting things, so you're not confined to doing it one way. Don't like spiders? Just get the better plant fibers, and the same goes for wood and stone. As of yet it can be somewhat frustrating to find resources because you can't just chop a tree down, and not every rock you see can be mined. So this can cause some frustration, but if you're me, and enjoy a bit of challenge to scrounge for resources then this is just for you.\n\nThe sea voyages can be lengthy if so choose and its nice, it gives you time to craft, fish and navigate. The game's features are ever expanding as this is early access so everything I love will only get better from here on out, for its price tag I fully recommend it. I got this on sale and even at its full price tag its worth it, so just buy it and enjoy slaying pirates, hunting deer, and sailing into the sunset.","January 4, 2015","true","98.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like the slow pace start of exploring your first islands and building up your supplies and experimenting with how things are crafted. You start with a book that tells you how to craft some of the basic items and another book gives you a brief explanation of your initial situation. From that point on its go west young man ( or N,S,E ). I like the unexpected discoveries. Saw a large galleon off shore, decided to board it, expected pirates and instead found a ship that you can repair with a locked treasure chest on board. Subsequentaly was killed by captain on island, when i revive i was on galleon by captain, but captain apparently swam away with chest.\n\nstarting out helpers\nX does indeed mark the spot, start digging\nblack flowers=poison. poison + arrow = deer dies over time just follow it.\nif you dont like night, which does last awhile, make a campfire.","June 21, 2015","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It had the potential to be a fun ,relaxing , peaceful game.  I do not know what the developers original plan was, but I think they made a mistake with the direction they have gone.\nIt is more violent, you have no choice but to kill if you want to get better armour and weapons and boats.\nBut beyond that , this game is unplayable.  It takes hours to get anywhere, sailing is tedious, there is no ingame way to tell where you have been (signs are useless).  Even with the sextant  and the better compass (which are not very accurate) it is difficult not to just sail around in circles and many times you find your self on islands where you have already been.\nThe  inventory is difficult to see for all but 20/20 vision.   The combat is unweildy and you have very little control over where your  sword is landing.   the only people that will be able to find the time to play this game are teenagers with no job or family or  chores to do,  The last people that will want to play this now boring game are teenager.\nI tried the latest test  game  and we are back to the glitch of finding oneself draowning int he ocean after dying,  where does my ship go?\nI can see where they are trying still to give the forum comenters what they want, but there are just to many things wrong  and they seem to be concentrating on the  visuals and not the game play.\nI would not recommend and I want my 15 bucks back.","January 24, 2015","false","238.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However steam don't count your hours ingame when you are offline. Warning sometimes when they update your save gets a bit corrupted (last time i spawned a different place than i quitted but they warned me before i loaded it)\n\nTLDR: Very good potential of a game 9/10\n\nCrafting: It has a somewhat good crafting system (you don't know the recipes but you can see which things that are able to have some sort of crafting but not that you have all the items) The "only" way you can craft then is to know the recipe from an earlier game, find a book which tells you how to craft it or just try to put some different things in the crafting box and see if it tells what can be crafted out of it. (of course there is wikis for the recipes but this seems quite fun to try for some time).\n\nNext is the games AI: The AI of the enemies in the game is pretty well made when you shoot a pirte with an arrow the pirate runs in zigzag (he runs against you but swaps direction from a little left to a little right) which makes it hard to kill him with arrows before he finds you. There is some fails in the system with when you go into water the pirates stop chasing and when 2 pirates stand side by side the person you shoot with your bow only reacts not the other one. A thing i miss is some kind of stealth system when you shoot a pirate or animal it always knows where you are.\n\nNext the landscape variaty (going to be placed in spoiler hold mouse over to see because it spoils the landscapes and things on the islands).  There are 2 different landscapes: Desert islands with palmes and standard grass/tree islands. However on these islands there can be quest givers, pirates or even pirate towns. I hope they make more different kinds of islands but remember it is early access\n\nCrashes and bugs: The time i have played also the offline time i have not experienced any major bugs or crashes.

There's still a lot of polish/features I think are needed eventually, but the core game functions and is pretty fun. There's not a ton to craft at the moment and my biggest disappointment is that you can't build structures. You can build or repair several ship models, add some items to them and sail them, you can explore the awesome procedurally-generated maps and craft stuff to wear, fight with, fish with, etc. You can see from the videos what the character models look like. It initially put me off, but it's like playing a Lego game, they just look cartoony but it doesn't really detract from my enjoyment. The team is finishing off the main story questline, so there's still active development and updates. Watch the videos and read some of the reviews to see what you are getting. This is not The Island or early Stranded Deep, but it's got a lot to offer.","January 7","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But we'll get to that.\n\nPros:\n-enemies are hard, but not impossible, you just need to plan out a little before hand\n-world seems almost infinite and wonderous\n-even when everyone uses the default seed, no-one yet agrees upon a set map (randomness FTW!)\n\nCon:\n-no built in map system.\n\n\nNow, this game has a LOT going for it, except the graphics, which frankly if you base games on graphics, you never played any "good-ol-games" like this one. but the map thing almost breaks it for me.  now there is an app outside of the game for helping to map, but again, it is super imprecise and after you're done, you know know if that was 3 separate little islands, or one long 3x1 island.  The game does include a sexant and compass, or else mapping in gerenal would be impossible, but you can never be quite sure of the units (i'm asuming they are "miles" or "knots" or something), but many of the starter islands are so close together that when you map it out, it almost looks like the center of the map is one big continent.  If there was a skill where you could draw or craft a map and put it in your boat like many other items, and update it as you go, i would love it.  it would make keeping track of where i've been and where i need to go a breeze, instead of "well i'm lost, lets go back to starter island (which BTW is never really at 0N-0E) and try to find where i was going.\n\nSo i don't totally feel like i'm bashing on this amazing game, i'll talk about MANY of the positives.  The landscape is wonderous and varied.  No two islands are the same, and sometimes it even seems like some islands change when you return (or i'm just super lost again). Remember when Assassin's Creed said that it would be unlikely that you cold take on more than 1-2 enemies or else they'd wreck you and then it turned out an entire army couldn't do ♥♥♥♥ to you? well this game made good on their promise.  If you tackle 2-3 pirates (the low level ones) on that first island you swam to with nothing but your pickaxe, you're gonna have a REALLY bad time.  That's not to say they are impossible, you just have to kite them with your bow and then pick them off 1 by 1.\n\nFinding, looting, and repairing an old pirate ship makes you feel like a boss.  they don't require too many materials, but they do require you to totally loot 2-3 islands to get enough, and then find that ship again.  but when you do, sailing the seas is easier, you feel like you have an actual ship, and that the world just became your oyster to cut open and find all the juicy pearls.\n\nInn's and Merchants, while being generic, have quests that have excellent stories and require you to find your own way through the world, none of this "bad guy here, kill, give me his head", it starts with a pirate stealing the inn keepers hat, then it grows into a cultist killing nightmare involving ancient moving statues and nighttime escapades. and the best part is, you have to find all this out on your own.  the inn keeper just says "the pirates stole my hat, get it back" and you have to go find which island it's on.\n\nPerfect, relaxing and makes me want more every time i play","January 10","true","29.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However steam don't count your hours ingame when you are offline. Warning sometimes when they update your save gets a bit corrupted (last time i spawned a different place than i quitted but they warned me before i loaded it)\n\nTLDR: Very good potential of a game 9/10\n\nCrafting: It has a somewhat good crafting system (you don't know the recipes but you can see which things that are able to have some sort of crafting but not that you have all the items) The "only" way you can craft then is to know the recipe from an earlier game, find a book which tells you how to craft it or just try to put some different things in the crafting box and see if it tells what can be crafted out of it. (of course there is wikis for the recipes but this seems quite fun to try for some time).\n\nNext is the games AI: The AI of the enemies in the game is pretty well made when you shoot a pirte with an arrow the pirate runs in zigzag (he runs against you but swaps direction from a little left to a little right) which makes it hard to kill him with arrows before he finds you. There is some fails in the system with when you go into water the pirates stop chasing and when 2 pirates stand side by side the person you shoot with your bow only reacts not the other one. A thing i miss is some kind of stealth system when you shoot a pirate or animal it always knows where you are.\n\nNext the landscape variaty (going to be placed in spoiler hold mouse over to see because it spoils the landscapes and things on the islands).  There are 2 different landscapes: Desert islands with palmes and standard grass/tree islands. However on these islands there can be quest givers, pirates or even pirate towns. I hope they make more different kinds of islands but remember it is early access\n\nCrashes and bugs: The time i have played also the offline time i have not experienced any major bugs or crashes. The only thing that can get wrong i have experienced is some AI problems and your save when they update however the write that saves bug when they update since they can update faster then which seems fair.\n\nThat was it hope you buy it because this can turn out to be a very good game (it is good now but it can be better).","July 1, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somnomania/recommended/327860/","somnomania","somnomania","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somnomania/","147 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI loved Miasmata's concept, but I hated how weak I was and having to deal with the monster for most of the game. I love Unturned but it's always felt very limited; you explore a map and that's it, there's no real need to keep surviving after that. I adore Minecraft, but it's too expansive in some ways and too easy in others. I have 500+ hours in Skyrim, and so much of that is exploring. Salt is the best of all of these games. It's been on my wishlist for a while, because I was immediately attracted to the concept of infinite places to explore, plus the crafting and travel and, unusually for one of these big survival crafting games, no forced multiplayer. I'm one of those weirdos who plays MMOs and wants nothing to do with other players most of the time, especially if they're total strangers, so the fact that this game has started with single-player development is a huge bonus for me.\n\nIt's in early access, but it only feels like it a little bit. The sailing and loot in particular feel really fleshed out already, and seeing the beginnings of lore and plot are reassuring. It could really benefit from a wider array of enemies, I think, both aggressive and passive; I've been mostly resting at night, and all I've seen is two types of pirate (one way more common than the other) and deer (which do have rarer colorations). And a merchant, finally, but that's not an enemy. Even some non-interactive wildlife would make things better, like some of the birds I hear on the islands, or seagulls, or even insects flying or hopping or crawling around. It just doesn't feel as populated as it could just yet, and part of it NEEDS to feel unpopulated, because it's infinite deserted (or not) islands, but at the moment the average of two deer and 3-5 pirates on most islands just feels kind of empty and lacking. Where are the hunters whose hideouts I find sometimes? Where are the villagers from the little clusters of huts? (Unless those huts were built by the pirates who are found nearby, but what self-respecting pirate lives on land?)\n\nOn the technical side of things, Salt is great. The range of graphics settings is good, the graphics themselves are that fun mix of stylized minimalism and realistic things like water and sun glare, and while there are some issues with things having weird white outlines (it's only the generic plants that give plant fibers that have this problem for me) and strange over-lit places among trees, that's stuff that can be fixed down the road. The ambient sound is lovely and peaceful. The music, where it appears, is fairly sudden, but so far it's been for things like my first actual ship ride, and finding my first merchant. I'm amazed that a game with procedural generation and theoretically infinite maps is under 500MB, but I'm not an expert on how games are built (yet).\n\nI really recommend this game if you like exploring and passive/low-effort resource collection. The devs are working on cartography as a priority, which I feel will just enhance the resemblance to Miasmata, but in all the best ways. A game featuring sailing as such a big part of gameplay really needs the accompanying maps and charts, so I'm really looking forward to that being in the game.","February 6","true","26.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It feels lazy since other games have the ability to cut down tree's including the ♥♥♥♥ ones.\n- Destructible terrain is also a must and instead of having boulders it would be nice to have mining with tons of more minerals adding on to the crafting of tools and other stuff which could expand on the crafting system.\n- I get that this is not minecraft but seriously X marks the spot also feels lazy when you find treasure and if you add in a mining system you could have a chance of running in to dungeons and even random chests of treasue.\n- More ships is also nice and even the ability to build ports and build your own big ships with the materials you gather.\n- Islands cant just be everywhere like in stranded it needs to be rewarding when you find an island which could make better use of the compas.\nOverall I am having fun playing the game but I am giving it the thumb down because even though  I see a lot of pottential however what worries me is the lack of updates, the last update was a month ago and it feels like not enough was added which worries me the the developers have just given up. So dont just buy it. If you must I would wait till a sale because the game at is current state is not worth 14.99$ asking price and should be lowered to 10$ or lower.","February 6","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's still a lot of polish/features I think are needed eventually, but the core game functions and is pretty fun. There's not a ton to craft at the moment and my biggest disappointment is that you can't build structures. You can build or repair several ship models, add some items to them and sail them, you can explore the awesome procedurally-generated maps and craft stuff to wear, fight with, fish with, etc. You can see from the videos what the character models look like. It initially put me off, but it's like playing a Lego game, they just look cartoony but it doesn't really detract from my enjoyment. The team is finishing off the main story questline, so there's still active development and updates. Watch the videos and read some of the reviews to see what you are getting. This is not The Island or early Stranded Deep, but it's got a lot to offer.","January 7","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It feels very rewarding to find treasure, especially when you're starting off and happen upon a resource rich island. If you're into exploring, a relaxing atmosphere and artful scenery then you better get this. Although, every now and then the low-poly, derpy looking pirates come out of no where and scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of me (the combat it surprisingly fun, if simple).\nI bought this game a while ago from the dev's website and recently came back to it today to realize that I needed to activate it with Steam since it's easier for them to update it that way, they responded quickly and gave me a code.","April 17","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I took exception to this and began hitting him back"\n\nA game to restore your faith in Early Access.\nLovely, simple, relaxing.\nFirst of all the graphics, they are stylized not poor. Sure they are not realistic, but they dont have to be.\nGameplay is absorbing and easy to handle if you have played a few survival games (although apart from combat, survival is assured). And the journeys from island to island with even the first boat you can craft are relaxing and wavey (nice to just drift and bob). The old familiar collecting of wood and rocks and plant fibres to craft are here, but crafting is not a major factor.\nOk I would like to see more content, but hell, don't we always? And I'm sure more will come and I have only just started and there is lots to do still.\n\nIt is a simple game but full of great gameplay and I am so far very happy with the purchase. 9/10\nUpdates will follow.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUPDATE:14/4/16\nWell my initial high hopes are wearing thin as this game has not really developed since the last review. The general feel of Early Access (unrefined UI, purpose of "why your here and what you should do next") is still overpowering and although updates have brought minimal new content and navigation improvements, It now really feels like this project could suddenly announce that it has reached full release because developers have new projects to be getting on with.....I hope this is not the case.","June 15, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
