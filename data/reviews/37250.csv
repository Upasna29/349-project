Great thing about this game is there is NO need for google, all of the puzzles are very intuitive which is rare in a mystery game. For mystery game fans or gamers looking for a change of pace this is a great game that will challenge your mind without becoming overly frustrating.\n\nRating: 9/10  Value: $9.99\n(-1 point because this is a series and the others seem to be missing on steam for those looking to continue their adventure in the realm of the Fairy Kingdom)","May 21, 2013","true","5.5"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

I loved it and always played the 1 hour demo of it when I was younger. After that I forgot about it for a long time. When I rediscovered it, I wasn't disappointed. The artwork is pretty, the sound is nice and the puzzles aren't too hard nor too easy. Sadly, the game ( and mainly the mouse) lagged a bit, but this  might be a problem just on my computer. One of the things that bothered me was that the game was a little slow paced at times, but that is just my opinion.I really hope the other parts will become available on steam too.\n\n7.5/10","January 20","true","3.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
