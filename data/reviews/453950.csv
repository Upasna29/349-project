When I complete it I will update the review to reflect the full playthrough.\n\nTo start out, let me say I'm not a huge fan of RPGmaker games. They tend to be slightly uninspired and use generic tilesets. Many of them I feel should be cheap or free at best. This one is different.\n\nThis is the opposite of the fantasy JRPGs you've played. You don't get stronger over time, you get weaker. Your character is but an old man, whose time has already passed. You start out with the best skills in the game and over time you lose them, mirroring the desperation of age.\n\nYour closest friend is a sentient shield who provides you with all kinds of information. You also meet some others along the way like a mercenary who admires you and a crazy woman who really likes to beat the crap out of people.\n\nThe major draw here is the writing. I don't want to spoil anything, but I've encountered a side-quest involving a little boy and his pet sheep that made me question if lying to children is wrong. If being in denial is better than knowing the truth. I've visited a forest full of floating eyeballs, and a town built against the side of an active volcano that could go off at any moment.\n\nDamn this game's world is just fascinating.\n\nSo far so good.","March 31","true","2.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","1"

From simple decisions such as to fight or flee, to weaving the story via their choice of words, this game excels in attaching the player to the story and the character.\n\nThe combat in this game is quite tactical, and this is thanks to the stance system. Without going into too much detail, it's basically a system that allows a player to alter their attack, defence, and magic-orientated statistics, as to minimise damage taken, and maximise damage output. Another thing that defines this game is the way in which the game deals with the effects of battle; As you fight, you're weakened. This system, yet again, makes the player think, and this is what truly defines the combat in this game.\n\nThe story, for me, is the best part of this game. Don't get me wrong, the design and combat are great, but the story offers something truly magnificent; it offers ideas that question our own values and morality. It shows us what all heroes eventually become, and this adds a layer of realism to the game; it reminds us that 'not everyone is a hero, and those who are, will meet the same end as you and I'.\n\nOverall, this game is a very deep, yet enjoyable experience which truly does test the emotions and psyche of the player. Would I recommend this to a friend? Most definitely, in fact this game is a game that should be played by everyone, due to the ability it possesses, in allowing people to measure their 'acceptance of mortality,' as well being an enjoyable (and in many ways relatable) game to play.\n\nLastly, the developer, Kyle Ballentine, should be held in high regard for creating this game, and developing the themes within it. Neon Skies Studio should also be held in high regard for their brilliant job on designing the original art for this game.","March 30","true","2.6"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","20","30","0","1"

The battle mechanics are fun and the storyline (so far!) is engaging. Without getting too much into it, it's an exploration of death and as that, it succeeds.\n\nThere are two things that I would point out in the interest of fairness.\n\n1) The aging (getting weaker) mechanic is basically the reason I bought the game. It seemed like a very interesting idea. I practice, I can't say the implementation actually changes much. Yes, you get weaker. But you also get stronger weapons as you progress and so it kinda levels out. Mostly, I expected to be invinsible in the early game and have to rely more and more on clever strategy as I progressed. But you're not that strong when you first start out and I've yet to feel the effect of growing weaker. It's still a fun game, but the mechanic is not as noticeable as I expected. I do find myself trying to avoid unnecesary battles but that's something I do anyways in most rpgs that are not horrible grindfests. Maybe a mechanic where the player get winded might've been nice. I don't know.\n\n2) The overall success of the game is undercut by the illustration work which is scattered throughout it and which features prominetly on the trailer. Simply put, it could be better and almost persuaded me not to try the game. (Which would've been a real shame beacause it's a pretty good game)\n\n\nThe writing is solid. The gameplay is good. I love the alternate game mode. I do hope people give this game a chance.\n\n","April 8","true","4.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
