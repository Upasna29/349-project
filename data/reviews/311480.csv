Vertical Drop Heroes HD is like Rogue Legacy "lite"...in a very good way.\nMost of my playtime with Vertical Drop Heroes HD has been with the GOG (DRM-free + original VDH) version. So my Steam stats don't reflect my total experience with this game.\n\nPROS:\n+Pick up and play accessiblity.\n+Easy to learn, difficult to master.\n+Fast arcadey action.\n+Stages are randomly generated, assuring replay value.\n+Unlocked abilities can be used with future characters, but characters can only carry 2 unlocked abilities with them at a time. This allows for very customizable gameplay, while keeping it challenging.\n+Gamepad support: Xinput (360, or Logitech F series set to "X").\n+Modest hardware requirements; most PCs built in the past 8 years should run VDH-HD.\n\nCONS:\n-No Linux support at the time of this review. But, given VDH-HD uses OpenGL, Linux users may be able to run it via Wine.\n-No Direct Input (Logitech and generic) controller support...yet.","October 28, 2014","true","2.4"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","30","33","2","1"

Here there's instant gratification including temporary level ups you lose after dying and permanent upgrades that are purchasable in the levels and in the hub with gold (which you only lose between runs when rerolling the heroes offered). Keys are important as well as they're used for multiple purposes like opening chests, removing obstacles, freeing computer controlled helpers or even bypassing a mini-boss with five keys. And there's more, for example short quests that get you XP, water that flows around when blocks are destroyed, the possibility to warp back to the top and lots of tombstones which e.g. spawn artifacts but also enemies when activated. Enemy variety is high, graphics are good enough for a 5-7€ game and the artstyle reminds me of Scribblenauts (in a good way).\n\nAlmost forgot another nice touch, you can play as 'pacifist' and gain more XP by picking up symbols that disappear after killing one enemy (kills by ai companions don't count). Also levels have modifiers, enemies with less HP but more damage, two bosses instead of one etc.\n\nA few cons: No online coop, only local and LAN. Sometimes enemies spawn right into me and when the health is low can lead to an unavoidable death. Or there's a bunch cuddled together and it's impossible to fight them without losing a lot of health (but avoiding those mobs is an option most of the time, plus health gets restored when leveling up which happens frequently). Lastly the controller config needs work due to a few inconsistencies and bugs and button icons would've been appreciated. Overall the controls are fine though, very responsive.\n\nSo thumbs up from me so far, a pleasant surprise.\n\nPS If someone cares for that kind of stuff the achievements are done right here, reasonably difficult and going for them will teach you some of the game's mechanics.","July 26, 2014","true","1.2"," 38 of 48 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","38","48","0","2"

This truly does its predecessor justice, giving that fantastic risk-reward system and adding so much more to it. There are some aspects of the game that are easy to exploit (using Confusion on the Worm boss makes the fight ever-so easy, especially when I know recharges are around the corner), but even with that, the game provides a good challenge and requires you to put both your platforming skills and rogue-like decision making skills to the test. I especially like the addition of the pacifist system. Normally the choice of "To fight or not to fight" comes down to whether or not you can gain more than you lose, but in this case with many fights being winnable without much or any loss, a reward for avoiding the easy massacres is tempting and very worth it. The story itself is also simple but very befitting; so often do games tell of the great hero that overcame evil with the dozens of game-overs in between never even being acknowleged. Knowing that each failed attempt is simply another step in the story makes me even more anxious for the next attempt.\n\nI look forward to seeing what comes out of Nerdook Productions next. Even if it's another remake of an old Flash game, I know it will be as good-- if not better than-- the original.","October 26, 2014","true","19.0"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emuholic/recommended/311480/","emuholic","emuholic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emuholic/","1742 products in account","Vertical Drop Heroes HD is a platform action game with RPG and rogue-like features. The story explains that a great hero will enter the portal at the Temple of Knowledge and fight their way through strange lands in search of the Holy Sanctuary that holds a great secret. There are many attempts by heroes to complete this challenge and you play as them.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osu9OwdSiCM\nWith each restart of the game, you will be given a choice from three random heroes to play as. The heroes stats are randomly generated from what has been unlocked. If you are not happy with the choice you can regenerate another three for a small amount of coin. The main stats generated at random are health, damage (dmg) and what traits, abilities and powers the heroes have.\n\nThere are 20 traits, 15 abilities, 15 powers and 16 weapons to unlock, mainly from merchants found in game and paid for with coins that you collect. These unlocks are persistent and are used in further replays. Your character has two traits and these include extra health, double jump and automatic coin collecting. Abilities include casting fireballs and lightning, to calling heroes to assist and creating traps. The powers include Dwarf Turrets and Sandstorms through to health regeneration for your character. The variety gives you a great degree of randomness when the characters are generated. This initially starts of with similar characters as nothing has been unlocked but as you progress and unlock more, the variety increases.\n\nThe game is split over ten stages of varying themes such as forests, caves, and lava filled volcanoes. The aim is to reach the bottom of the procedurally generated stage by making your way downwards via platforms, enemies and other obstacles. You have two options to complete a level; all out attack or pacifist. Pacifist is enabled by default, you must not kill any enemies. This may sound strange as you level up by killing enemies, instead you collect hearts which reward you with XP and gold. If you kill an enemy then the pacifist mode is disabled and it is business as usual; killing enemies for XP and gold.\n\nAs you make your way down each stage you come across hazards such as water, lava, spikes and guard posts which spawn more enemies if touched. There are a good variety of enemies, usually designed around the stage theme. They can also have different abilities and traits which can change with each playthrough such as the ability for all enemies to fly. This also extends to the bosses at the bottom of each stage, including a devastating gun toting boss who destroys everything on screen! You will also come across Shrines which are often helpful giving you a chance for attacks such as lightning strikes or rewards such as coins or keys in return for a small payment or spawning some enemies. There are also chests which are unlocked with keys and reward you with health and coins. Finally, there are cages which when unlocked, release a hero who will help you in your journey.\n\nVertical Drop Heroes HD manages to get the gameplay spot on in my opinion. Personally, I like to play a stage as a pacifist for as long as possible and if/when it goes wrong, start attacking. The stage design usually allow you to do this and it is great fun spending a little time working out the best routes to avoid enemies as much as possible. As you progress through the game, the new unlocks play an important role and greatly improve your chances to complete the levels as you intend to.\n\nThe ten stages may sound short, but after the first couple they increase in difficulty. You can choose to start from the first stage or if you have unlocked a later stage you can skip straight to that. A New Game+ mode is available after you complete the game and offers a harder challenge. It is very addictive, your characters death is usually welcome as it means you get to experience new characters with new stats to learn and play with. I have played the game for several hours over the past few days and it is perfect for quick ten to fifteen pick up and play or longer sessions. Priced at only $5.00 (homepage price), Vertical Drop Heroes HD is great value for money and comes highly recommended!\n\nGameplay - 9/10 - Addictive gameplay that keeps you coming back for one more go. Procedural generation and upgrades to keep the game feeling fresh every playthrough.\nGraphics - 8.5/10 - Nice cartoon style graphics and designs. Slightly annoying tooltips get in the way of the action occasionally.\nSounds - 8/10 - A good selection of music which changes across the levels and work well with the themes.\nFinal Score - 8.5/10\n\nOriginally posted on gamergeddon.com.","July 26, 2014","true","7.3"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

The width of your screen is always the width of the level. You will fight your way down each floor to the bottom where a sealed portal lies. To unlock the seal you must defeat the boss or unlock it using 5 keys (which you also expend to open locked trapdoors earlier in the level and treasure chests) or, if the situation or an aspect of your character allow for it, destroy the wall surrounding the portal.\n\nAs you defeat enemies you gain experience and gold, the experience goes directly to your current character to empower him/her, the gold is primarily used between runs to get better base stats and upgrades as well as at merchants you encounter randomly on some floors that will sell you new weapons, traits and spells.\n\nThe whole thing wraps up nicely with a satisfying and challenging final boss.\nOne of the main things that sets this game apart from similar games (or specifically Rogue Legacy) is that not killing enemies is a viable alternative. Until you've killed your first enemy on each floor you'll be able to see and pick up pacifist sigils that are dotted around the level. Picking these up will grant experience and gold, same as killing enemies. It's not always a viable option (sometimes you'll really need to dispatch enemies in your path), but it's nice that there's an incentive to change things up every now and then and not kill everything in sight.\n\nI've compared this game several times now to Rogue Legacy, which might not be entirely fair.\nThe question is, though, does this game offer anything that Rogue Legacy doesn't?\nIt does, and it's a game I recommend. However, if you've not yet played Rogue Legacy I couldn't recommend this more, so I would suggest playing that first.","January 12, 2015","true","4.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

And I am one of those people who finds them annoying.\n\nBack in the day when I didn't have many games on my Steam account there was this wonderful place called the internet to search for old games, Java games or Flash games which were pretty much free and easy to pick up. When I still played Flash games I played quite some of these games made by Nerdook and they were somewhat fun to play. A lot of stuff to play for a low price of website ads.\n\nUnfortunately the charm didn't really last after seeing the massive collection of great indie and AAA titles on Steam and finally being able to buy them. Vertical Drop Heroes HD is pretty much the same game as the Flash version with just small changes but overall features the same gameplay.\n\nThe game is roguelike 2D-verticalscrolling-"platforming"-game where your goal is to upgrade your stats, gain levels, defeat bosses and finally be powerful enough to complete the game. It certainly sounds like a neat idea and the game plays quite nicely but after a while some people will notice the reason why I can't recommend this game and some will just enjoy it hour after hour.\n\nThe keyword here is time. Overall, the game is quite easy, Money grinding is time consuming and doesn't really reward you enough to keep doing it so you'll just use all your cash on level skips instead. You either play it the long way getting all the upgrades for your run and maybe reaching the final level in a couple of hours or you take it slow and get bored with the game.\n\nEven though the levels are randomly generated there is not much difference between the levels on each run. Same enemies and block on every certain level and the only things that do change are the bonuses and mini-quests on levels. These award you bonuses for your current run only.\n\nThis game certainly works for those who don't really like games with deep story plots or multiplayer games but still want something to play on your coffee breaks this is just the game for you. But even then this game lacks power of you wanting to complete the game for other reasons than getting the Achievements.\n\nMight be worth picking up on Sale. But be very careful since this game maybe won't be the game you desired.","November 11, 2015","false","6.9"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","19","27","0","0"

Instead of scrolling left or right, your hero will be going straight down! This twist offers some interesting strategies, for example, planning where to drop down will be important. Since you can't go back up with out a special block, you could miss important loot if you went down the wrong path. The game does have a passive progression system, comparable to Rogue Legacy. You earn money to buy either in dungeon help, new abilities to randomly gain later, or save it up to earn permanent stat upgrades back at home base. It also plays like a standard Rogue-like/lite. Out side of the dropping down aspect, for any one who is experienced with this genre, this will feel very familiar (this can be taken as either a good or a bad, depending on what you're looking for).\n\nThe most addictive aspect of the game is certainly it's plethora of modular upgrades, giving players near endless combinations of characters and dungeons to crawl...er... fall through.\n\nThough the game is quite fun and addictive, it's not with out it's flaws. The combat is very basic, simply mashing the attack near enemies or use 1 of the 2 specials your toon gets generated with. I'm also not really a huge fan of the visuals. This is a personal critique, as some will find it quite charming, but for me, it just doesn't float my boat.\n\nOverall, The game doesn't do too much to evolve the genre, but what it does, it does it well.

In general, nature of the game as a roguelike offers a tempting challenge to complete 10 levels, but once you do that, you don't want to play it again. It’s more a game you enjoy completing than actually playing. While there’s some joy at the start, it’s too easy to get burnt out on the grinding, dying, grinding, dying, grinding, dying pattern, all the while hoping you’ll get the perfect combination of character traits that you would both enjoy and succeed with. Back to the original question: does Vertical Drop Heroes HD succeed at making a flawed Flash game into a worthwhile PC gaming experience? Well… it doesn’t fail. It’s difficult to ignore the things it does well (level design, variety in abilities, etc), but it’s just not up to the challenge of balancing the tediousness of a roguelike with the fun of an action platformer.

The main mechanic of each hero's run through the levels, and inevitable death, slowly improving your future heroes until you can finally overcome all 10 levels is quickly becoming one of my favorite gaming tropes. The music is solid with a few outstanding tracks supporting the more mundane forgettable ones. I also like the idea of a platformer being vertical for a change, especially one where you descend, that's a nice fresh take I've not seen since Tobe's Vertical Adventure.\n\nIt's a strong recommendation in my book and well worth the asking price.","July 25, 2014","true","14.0"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","5"

You can summon a dragon to fight for you how awesome is that !, i really mean it a  huge selection of spells to unlock.\n\nThe gameplay is basically on the game's title, you keep going down, and each level has a (SideTasks) that either gives you Exp or Gold or DMG or whatever, and asks to ( kill XX monsters or find secret item and other more ) they are fun to do and benefiting.\nAt the end of each level, you will find a Guardian which is basically a boss, need to kill it to progress to next level, At each level they get harder and harder.\nyou also have the ability to (start from level 2 .. 3 .. etc ) (Like spelunky) so you dont always have to restart from level 1.\n\nWith the more you progress in the game the harder the enemies get and the boss fights gets crazier!.\nThe Game is pretty challenging on its on way.\nMake no mistakes the singleplayer is 100% done and perfect, and the multiplayer is basically 2 players adventure, or you can also Do a local SplitScreen.\n\n"Note that this game has a very great replay value so its not a One gameplay thing."\n\nOnce you finish the game you can unlock NewGame+ (NG+) That has its leaderboard, and extremely harder than the original game and you get to keep your progress and upgrades.\n\nIf you are an Expert with platformers, it would take you 3 to 4 hours to finish this game, and to unlock all the abilities and upgrades another 10+ hours to add so thats really great.\n\nThe Good thing about Multiplayer is that the enemies are harder and gives more experience, so its harder to play with a friend which is good : ).\n\ni LOVE gamemaker studio games they are simply amazing this is my 2nd most favorite game created in it, Valdis being my first, And I definitely recommend this game to Rogue-like platformer player out there. 8/10\n\nit is sad some voted this down because they heard its like rogue legacy and got disappointed.... so they felt mad and failed to see what a beautiful game it is on its own.","July 28, 2014","true","5.8"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","18","32","0","4"

I was surprised, but I also ended up liking what I found. It's a much more complex game now, while still keeping the fun and speed of the original.\n\nThe big difference is the relationship between your character and the trapped heroes. Freeing a hero from their cage doesn't transform your player character into that hero, but instead releases the hero into the game world to fight alongside you as a friendly NPC. Luckily, your player character is no longer the powerless vanilla jump-man from the original either. In a system that, yes, is a lot like Rogue Legacy's, you start each game choosing from a trio of characters generated with different statistics, traits and equipment. You can unlock new character options through achievements and in-game merchants.\n\nMy main complaint about this new system is that the AI heroes can sometimes be quite unhelpful, particularly the paladin breaking blocks you'd rather leave intact and the archer, who lacks mobility-based powers, getting stuck and being unable to contribute to the battle. AI heroes can also trigger alarms, though this never felt too obtrusive or unfair.","July 28, 2014","true","5.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

At first I was looking at that screen thinking there are three set character classes to choose from. But then I realised that the characters themselve are randomly generated. Yeah you can't pick and choose exactly what you want, but it is still really really cool. With procedural level generation you obviously have variety in the stages which is good. Occasionally randomly generated terrain can seem hard to navigate or get through safely, but it works pretty well overall.\n\nI liked the way the game looked. Some of it's really cute. I like the way you pretty much just wave your sword around like a feather duster when you attack and the happy expression on your characters face when you beat a boss. I liked the spiel before character selection about the prophecy and how every hero thinks that they are the chosen one but most of them die during their adventure. I think that really goes well with a game that has perma-death and where you take control a new hero after each death. The music was really cool. It and the sounds effects brought back memories of older console games like the Super Mario Brothers.\n\nSo yes, I reccommend this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/311480/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","Vertical Drop Heroes is a port of a web browser game, so as you might expect, the graphics aren’t the game’s selling point. Think of the game as a time killer that you can theoretically beat in about half an hour if everything goes your way, but most likely you’ll die and restart a bunch of times due to the game’s random nature. -  8/10\n\nThe game doesn’t have much of a backstory, but that doesn’t matter since you’re just trying to work your way downward through randomly generated levels gathering money and treasure keys. The gold coins you collect carry over to subsequent playthroughs, so the more times you play the game the more powerful your randomly generated character can become. You’re able to buy upgrades for things like life, damage, and treasure value.  Every time you start up the game you choose from 3 randomly generated characters with random stats / powers / perks, meaning if you get an awesome character you can make an attempt at beating the game.  If all 3 of your character options suck, just spend the game picking up as much money as you can before dying, and hopefully you will have a better character to start with next time.\n\nAs you descend each level, you’ll find various mini quests to gain money / exp as well as locked up allies that you can set free with one of your precious treasure keys. These computer controlled allies will fight alongside you until they inevitably die or until you beat the level. At the very bottom of each level is a boss with significantly higher life that you can either kill for a bunch of money, or avoid by unlocking the door to next level (using 5 of your keys). Personally I’d suggest killing all the bosses since money for upgrades is so important.\n\nPros:\n+Despite how short the game seems, there is a lot of replay value because of the randomly generated levels and the characters you can choose. You probably won’t beat the game until you’ve amassed a large amount of gold and purchase a bunch of upgrades for your characters.\n+You can play for 20 minutes at a time just gathering money, or for several hours trying to work your way through every level to face off against the final boss.\n\nCons:\n-The random nature of the game might turn some people off. Personally I’ve never been a big fan of rogue-like games. If you’re into RPGs, it could ♥♥♥♥ you off if you only have crappy characters to choose from over and over. Fortunately, you can reroll for a different set of hero choices (at a small gold cost).\n\nOverall, if you enjoy rogue-like games but don’t want to completely start over from scratch every time you die, give Vertical Drop Heroes a try. If you’re like me you will appreciate the option of grinding for gold and upgrading your hero options. I’ve never liked games where you have to start over after making a tiny mistake and dying.\n","January 19","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Like games like bardbarian, annoying how it doesn't let you beat the game until you've died like 100 times and grinded enough money to get stronger from the start. Also combat is wonky as if you get hit unless you have spear you get auto hit. Nice how there are perks, abilities, different weapons (although most suck). Stupid that some weapons are just strictly better than others. Some abilities are wastes and there are clear bests. Would have liked more than 1 levels total and dumb how boss you have to kill 7 times, and he gets random abilities and with certain ones you auto lose. More heroes to unlock would have been nice. Not worth it unless you have a friend or more to play with, although no online co-op which is a misstep.

This means that you will hit enemies when you are close enough to do that. In addition to this you have two skills that depend on which skills you have already unlocked through playing. You pick from 3 slightly different characters that are randomly given some stats (i.e. damage +50%, health -25%), skills (i.e. magic bolt, arrows, daggers) and weapons (i.e. sword, spear, bow).\n\nYour task is to descent down the "dungeon", kill a boss at the end of each level (or unlock the door to the next level by other means) and move to the next level. Enemies and bosses get tougher of course and you will die a lot during the process.\n\nWhen you die you will start from the "village" where you can purchase persistend upgrades for your future characters like more health, damage or better rewards from collecting pasifist-items that dissappear from the level if you kill any creatures yourself (activated shrines or allies don't count).\n\nI haven't tried the co-op at all so I can't tell if the game is more fun like that but usually more the merrier.\n\nPros:\n-Cute (though mobilelike) graphics\n-Co-op\n-Easy to pick up and play couple of characters\n-Great distraction in between other games or activities\n\nCons:\n-Basic attack feels awful\n-Some cheap deaths (first time you see a boss and it one-shots you)\n-Movement isn't as sharp as I hoped for\n-The upgrades in the village don't feel fun or meaningful enough\n\nI give the game 7/10 and probably 8/10 with co-op included.

I keep only using the bone dagger basically since at least you're doing some tactics (the weapon does more damage from behind the enemy) whether you want to or not. And personally I always try to go for back kills anyways due to the hitboxes. (read about the hitboxes at the end of this review)\n\nChoose from one of three different heroes à la Rogue Legacy each with their own two sets of abilities, stats, weapons. You can be everything from a dual blade rogue to a powerful mage shooting lightning and whatnot. What I also find great is that there's a type of double jump incorporated so when you fall or walk off a ledge you can jump once again in mid-air. Allowing for some interesting tactics and paths.\n\nApart from challenges in the game and achievements which also work as a little guide for weapon unlocking. There's coins, keys, chests, small quests, upgrades and effects that are both temporary or permanent for future characters, which you can also buy from shops and shrines. There's also certain shrines that will allow you to buy shortcuts to the level you're in. Which is both good and bad naturally.\n\nThe game controls really well with my 360 controller and all your gold carries over when you continue after dying. Though you get a minus 5 gold when you reroll at the character screen. Graphically it's very Battleblock Theater and Scribblenauts-ish and I think it's a very fitting and welcome artstyle. The soundtrack is also fantastic in my opinion and far from repetetive. Definitely worth the pricetag.\n\n2] Bad parts and wanted changes\nAfter a couple of more hours there are some annoyances, the first being that button mashing and rushing is basically a no-no especially in NG+ which so far feels very luck based. And since there's a timer on normal and NG+ it'd be fun to speedrun but I'm not sure if this is worth it sort of.\n\nBosses are quite dull with predictable with very similar attack patterns. So you end up with the exacty same tactic everytime, either spam all your magic/refill magic at the shrine near the boss and spam it again. Or hide under him and hit him once, back away quickly, rinse and repeat.\n\nI also don't like the hit boxes at all, no matter what weapon you have you're better of hitting them from behind carefully. After spending quite a lot of time grinding both HP and Strength powerups I kind of feel that they do little difference. I just end up with personal favorite Magic powerups and the Gifted trait and hope for the best basically. Even at level 25 in HP upgrades you can still die very quickly.\n\nFinally, it's not a huge deal breaker but it can sometimes become a bit too chaotic where you can't see your character with all the bombs, exploding blocks, enemies, projectiles etc.\n\nAll in all I think with some balancing, nerfing (for once) it could be even better. Still highly recommended.","July 27, 2014","true","14.5"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

It would be ok as a flash game to kill an hour or two but not worth buying. The only redeeming quality is the local co-op, but the game still has fundamental issues with their design.\n\n[Combat]\nVery repetative and dull combat. Hitting someone isn't an issue of hitting them with you weapon but more of them being in front of you when you strike (as in the weapon never connects). Every battle is composed of hitting the opponent then stepping back quickly so you can go in and stab them again (with slight variation if you still have your spell left to use).\n\n[Store system]\nYou can buy two things that makes you stronger. More damage and more health. You can also purchase an upgrade for the passive coins on the maps (they are worth experience and gold, they disappear when an enemy is killed).\n\nSpread out through the map are merchants selling a single ability each. These will then be shuffled into your random spells for your new generations. Most of these purchases are regretted as there is no way to confirm if an ability is good until you purchase it and use it.\n\nThe store system is over all very underwhelming and it feels like the store system was added last minute to balance the fact that levels only get harder because the monsters have more health and hit harder.\n\n[Level design]\nThrow in random blocks in a maze where you navigate to the bottom where the boss is. Add prisoners (that help you if you let them out) and treasures. Plus a quest per level that is either find Y of X or kill Z and come back to me. The map is not designed so that you can travel upwards, to combat this there are teleporters that bring your to the beginning spread out across the map.\n\nYou start from level 1 and progress upwards.  Some levels have the ability to pay gold so that you can teleport there instantly (for a negligible price) in new generations. Monster design is pretty limited, the higher level the map is the harder the monsters hit. They look different and sometimes they might be ranged but all in all this doesn't change much.\n\n[Stability]\nCrashed only once every 30-45 minutes and never in a way that progress was lost. Starting the game is quick and easy through Steam Big Picture Mode so this was more of a nuisance than a problem.","November 27, 2014","false","3.5"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","17","33","0","0"

You can spend the gold you find and/or earn to increase the starting damage and health of all you future characters. You can buy and unlock new spells that do a wide array of cool stuff. There's even a Pacifist playstyle if you want, where you simply go through the level dodging attacks and avoiding killing. So long as you don't kill anything(directly), there will be 'Pacifist Orbs' floating around which gives you a small bit of experience and gold to compensate for what you miss out on when you don't kill, which is basically experience and gold.

The game has you level up while your playing and each time you level up you get more and more powerful until you are one shotting enemies... until you aren't, in which case the game gets challenging again. I find this much more pleasant than the cruelty of being killed by a neon green snake.\n\nUsing your recovered loot, you can permanetly upgrade your health and weapon damage which further changes the difficulty curve. You can also purchase portals to individual levels so that you can go straight to them. Some of the weapons you get are very fun. A spear does knockback damage, there is a buckler which will cause you block most attacks. There is a sword called a reaver that heals you as you damage others. These extra weapons add a lot of dimension to the game.\n\nOverall, I have played this game for 4 hours, which is more than I have played any other roguelike and I forsee myself playing it for at least a few more hours. Definitely buy.","November 6, 2014","true","7.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's like Rogue Legacy, but it's actually well-designed and optimized for having fun.\n\nFor one thing, you get to keep your coins through deaths. So even if you die, you still feel like you made progress towards your next upgrade. (Unlike Rogue Legacy where all coins are taken away each death and if you don't have enough for an upgrade, you just completely wasted 20-30 minutes.)\n\nAnother positive is that there's generally a lot fewer projectiles flying all over the screen so it doesn't feel cheap like other 2D games (again like Rogue Legacy).\n\nThe various power ups also are fun, well-designed, and distinctive to make every play through surprisingly strategic. Your choice of character really changes the way you attack the game. For example, you might choose a character that has a ranged weapon, or a character with +33% damage but -33% hp, or the ability to open chests without keys (but then you forego an offensive trait). There is an extremely deep strategy in this game and you always feel like you are progressing.\n\nLast but not least, every level has a crystal that you can activate (by spending a lot of coins) which allows you to skip to that level on the next playthrough. Something that Rogue Legacy desperately needed. If you get sick of the early levels, you can simply just skip them with a few coins (the caveat being that your character won't be as high level as if you played through those levels).\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic 2D platforming rogue-like with fast and light-hearted, but deeply strategic gameplay. By allowing you to keep your coins through death, you're always progressing. I finished the game in about 8 hours in single-player. I didn't get a chance to play split-screen but I imagine that would be even more fun.\n\nHighly recommended!","October 25, 2015","true","7.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

When I first looked at the still pictures the game really doesnt impress. However see it in action and it looks really good. Your character can die very easily at first. A monster looks at him the wrong way and your dead. However you can raise your stats after you die to increase damage and health and other stuff. That part is a lot of fun once I figured it out.\n\nThe bad or downer side for me would be the randomness of the game. Sometimes for whatever reason the game will spawn  bad guys right on top of your head. I thought it was the people I freed doing it however it appears to be random and that is not so much fun due to the fact that my character is paper thin and anything hitting you seems like it does double damage.\n\nYou can try to sneak past the boss at the end if you have enough keys. Also even if you do nothing sometimes your going to end up with a no win option. Meaning some game rooms are designed for you to fail. Not enough keys bad level design take low on health take your pick. That part is extremly annoying. I dont mind getting killed due to my actions but when the game gives you a terrible room or unkillable things. Some stupid squid I could not kill due to them being like casper the ghost however they could kill me very easily. BS by the way.\n\nThen that gets on my nerve. So fun game, interesting concept. Good looking graphics. The downers would be rooms were you cannot win, lame enemies you sometimes cannot kill and or bosses your trapped with and cannot kill.\n\nAfter having played this for about 4 hours and getting only to room 5 or 6 decided to end my playing time with this game. The idea is sound in theory actual game play leaves much to be desired. To much grinding to much cheap deaths either by your stupid suicidal helpers  or by they game insta killing you in some spots.

Something that is obvious from the title.\n\nIn addition to that 'pacifist orbs' reward you for collecting them before killing any monsters on the level.  After players can take advantage of teleporters to warp to the top and slaughter enemies on a second pass to optimize each level's run.\n\nThe rest of the game is standard rogue like hooks: use gold to unlock abilities, upgrades and warp points.

It is a "side-scrolling" platformer per se, except that you don't really go to the "side". The basic goal in Vertical Drop Heroes is, well, to drop vertically. It's like Ice Climber in reverse where you have to traverse and fight your way through enemies and obstacles in order to reach the bottom where you have to beat the level "boss" in order to "win".\n\nSuch a simple game, so what could possibly go wrong? Nothing actually, if you only look at the gameplay. So let's look at the overall model.\n\nVertical Drop Heroes only support local split-screen multiplayer or LAN. This is where I put my demerit points at. Being an avid cooperative gamer with lots of friends in gaming, I find it not worth the value. You have Maple Story, which is a massively multiplayer online game, and it's free. So why exactly would you pay for a game that limits your multiplayer options? No, it's not even worth it even if it's on sale. This kind of game is not something you should pay for. And no, it's not even worth all the trouble to find online multiplayer mods for it.\n\nMy two cents? Only buy it if you're planning on playing alone. But seriously, you're better off playing Solitaire, or join the crowd at Maple Story.","April 7, 2015","false","3.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","4","10","2","0"

I figured it would be a fun game to play with others, so I ended up buying it for my wife too... that was a mistake.\n\nFor one, the "Local Network" multiplayer option is unreliable.  It seems as if at any hint of a network error, the game drops all connections and kills the server.  Very frustrating if you make it far in a run.  Furthermore, I ran into numerous bugs that crashed my client (problem 1) that meant that the server (my wife's machine) would quit too (problem 2).  Combined with the constant lag, LAN multiplayer was simply unplayable.  I know it was not my connection because other games work fine over LAN (e.g. Terraria).\n\nAnother gripe I have with this game is that it seems as if it were designed for multiplayer, but it handles it so poorly.  Split screen is hardly any better than LAN, as the screen is split vertically into THREE chunks (one for the stats), which means you get much skinnier screens to play on, and have to potentially look on the other side of the monitor to gauge your stats... this wouldn't be so much of an issue if it were easy to discern what was going on.  Instead, there are so many strange user interface choices that finding your character can be a hassle.  All characters (be they your hero, any ally, an enemy, a clone, an NPC, etc.) all have the same color health bar, so in fights it's easy to get lost.\n\nThe poor user experience choices don't stop there.  If playing with another person and they die, you have to complete the level before they are resurrected.  If they died at the beginning, that means your ally cannot join for potentially a long time... not exactly "fun."  On top of that, there is no option to "restart game", so you either have to suicide or exit + recreate the LAN/split game to continue.  It's just such a pain to play with all these (intentional) decisions and (unintended) bugs.\n\nThis is a fun game with a lot of potential, but it clearly was designed from a gameplay standpoint to be played with multiple people, but from a UI standpoint of being played with one (or even fewer).  I'd love to see an update, but I doubt it will come.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saganx420/recommended/311480/","saganx420","sagan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saganx420/","296 products in account","First off: I got this game for free from some giveaway so I felt sorta bad giving it a negative review, but in the end I decided that a frustrating gift is strill frustrating and someone might be buying this game with his money so here I am.\n\nSomeone called this game "Rogue Legacy Lite" and personally I think he was high on meth or pcp. Real talk though I see where the comparision is coming from: it's a 'roguelike' game where you get a new character with somewhat random statistics and perks influenced by what you uncover via playing the game. I can see the developers being strongly influenced by Rogue Legacy but they took a wrong path midway.\n\nI want to start with the menu and first impression. Game's got 3 gamemodes: single player, splitscreen and LAN. Alright, why is there LAN, but no Online option? You can fool no one, this doesn't require much more work, nobody asks you to run a server, let one of the players be the server, come on. Another thing: why is there no volume control? Why is autoattack set to ON on default? I'm gonna talk about that in a second, cause that's SOMETHING completely different.\n\nYou start the game, ready to rock, you spawn in some sort of a chamber (which is kinda nice) and they introduce you to very basics of upgrading stuff and there's even some nice "teasers" of what's about to come. Then you start the actual level and oh boy, is it fun.\n\nWell, first thing's first: the audio is just... crackling? The levels are too high sometimes and it seems like it never got compressed which leads to you hearing crackling noises, but it's only a minor annoyance. Overall the music and sound effects are just average. Nothing special, nothing memorable, but not really annoying or bad.\n\nThe gameplay's whole lotta worse. When you first play this game it's ok and sorta fun, then you start realizing it's EXTREMELY repetitive, every level has got the same basic pattern and some mechanics are really frustrating. Most weapons are basically melee and you're bound to get hit by most enemies, except for the ones who stand still and have long attack cooldown. For all the other kinds of enemies you just get hit when you hit them, unless you're being extremely careful and the enemy stands in place due to the fact he's got nowhere to run.\n\nGame offers "Pacifist runs" (without killing the enemies) and for the most part, at beginning I was wondering how that works. It doesn't really pay off for the most part, unless you're willing to backtrack and kill all the enemies after completing a pacifist run. Also the first couple of times I tried it I couldn't do it because I would end up killing people unwillingly 90% of the time. Mostly due to the random nature of the game. Sometimes enemies can be placed in a way that you HAVE TO take a hit and since AUTOATTACK IS ON AT DEFAULT you end up killing them as well. So, disable the autoattack and you can complete a sado-masochistic run, you don't even benefit from (only in some special cases).\n\nEven though the platforms and 'blocks' are placed randomly, it's always in the weirdest patterns with horrible enemy placement, none of the runs are memorable and due to how every level is made (just a vertical level with a boss on the very bottom), it gets boring REALLY fast. I tried to play that game for as long as I could without killing myself or driving myself to psychosis, and I didn't perservere for long.\n\nIt's not that this game is completely bad, but they tried to 'remix' a concept and failed. It doesn't feel good. Mechanics are weird. Balancing is done poorly (why are damage upgrades done in step of +1, why not make a more expensive upgrade of +3 and then balance it better?). I think developers also KNEW the fighting system and enemy placement was terrible and you were about to get hit by EVERYTHING, and that's why they decided you're gonna level up every 5 enemies and replenish your HP that way. Jumping controls are a bit off. Why is there limited ammo for ranged weapons (to elaborate a bit: I know why, but this isn't the right solution, since you're basically forcing players to save it up for bosses, because they can't allow to trade hits with them)? Why are all the upgrades so 'meh' (actually 'unlocks'). Why is this entire game such a 'MEH'?\n\nPlaying this game feels like cheesing it, there's no appeal to it whatsoever, it's pretty bad, gets boring quickly and no amount of recycling ideas from Rogue Legacy or Godlike (♥♥♥♥ that game, seriously) is gonna fix it. Fix the basics, play your own game a bit, balance it and maybe it might become playable.","October 17, 2015","false","1.3"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","8","20","0","2"

It wasn't until two days ago (as of writing) that I actually launched the title-and, admittedly, I had more fun playing this than I had expected of a "Metroidvania Rougelike Puzzle Platformer Action RPG Extravaganza" or whatever catchy buzzword advertisements are currently affixed.\n\n1. Linear progression that is partly Random Number Generation (RNG) but mostly linear. Permanent hero upgrades, which are applied to all future sheep sent to the slaughter (this game is about dying several times until you win), are reasonably priced to improve damage potential and starting health.\n\n2. RNG isn't awful. I don't know what the map design algorithm is, but it works. The right combination of abilities and traits (the roster of which expands as you play) allows most levels to be beaten without killing any monsters, albeit this is difficult and does require some strategy. Merchants, who sell new abilities and qualities/traits (I don't remember the mechanical title), are occassionally dotted throughought the 10 levels who sell at a reasonable price.\n\n3. Intuitive. Enemy tactics and abilities are easy to learn through observation before confrontation, and information kiosks are everywhere (though most of the game is easy to guess or learn by trial-and-error)\n\n4. Non-punitive difficulty. You are not going to beat all 10 levels on your first "Run" (attempt); you will lose many, many heroes in your quest to achieve glory (or fame or riches or whatever). You are going to throw several heroes to their deaths, each time making it *slightly* further, knowing your odds will be even better on the next attempt. In most games this is a god-forsaken grind; VDH is built around making small improvements and gains between runs in a manner that is actually fun. Dying doesn't result in all of your grinded currency (used to make permanent hero upgrades, or to purchase healing/offensive help during a run) being stripped arbitrarily. Money is only lost when it's spent.\n\n5. "Pacifist Mode" As I mentioned above, it is possible to complete levels without a single kill. While it isn't as large an accomplishment as Deux's Pacifism achievement, you are rewarded with orbs that are worth about as much (if not more) $ and XP as killing would. This isn't a tacked-on option, either; some abilities make pacifism easier (like stealth-based powers), and in addition to using gold to improve a hero's attack and health, money can be spent on permanently increasing the value of pacifist rewards.\n\nMy only gripe is that split-screen (local) multiplayer is a headache. The camera centers on either of the 2 heroes (who each get half the screen) and moves slightly to track movement. I'm not very susceptible to the headaches of high saturation, screen tearing, etc that most people complain about, but trying to beat 1 level in split screen mode by myself (for an achievement) was extremely difficult. I don't think this is an issue that can be fixed, but it's something to keep in mind: The splitscreen multiplayer has slightly awkward tracking, and the general blur of explosions, abilities, and enemy attacks can make it a true excercise in patience.","March 31, 2015","true","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, that only kind of makes the game easier because once you FINALLY complete one round, the levels get harder.\n\nRandomly generated heroes is definitely a huge plus sign.\n\nSadly, the split screen multiplayer is difficult to follow because it's half as big without any proportional adjustments.

With your hero you will collect gold and keys. The gold is used to buy new traits and abilities. Gold can also be used to buy starting higher starting health and damage. You will descend down each level killing enemies or not killing them and collecting passive orbs. You will find keys in each level as well. These keys unlock chests or cages to free other heroes. The heroes will attack enemies, but some do other things as well. The wizard will periodically protect you with a shield. The rogue will drop gold and if he lives long enough he will drop a gem. The black flags will turn red and summon enemies if you trigger them. Shrines also exist in the level offering the ability to replenish abilities or allow you to stealth past a section. You can also pay shrines to provide a lightining, fire, or ice attack. There is also an option to upgrade the passive orbs you can gather with gold. Keep a look out for areas that have two key locks on top that lead to a green crystal. Activating it will allow you to pay a small amount of gold to skip to that level instead of starting at level 1. Each level ends with a boss which must be killed to unlock the portal to the next level. Alternatively you can use 5 keys and skip the boss.\n\nThe Good:\nIt's a very addicting just one more run kind of game. The cartoon graphics are fun. It's a huge leap forward from the old flash game it started as. The variety of differnt moves and passives are fun. The controls are pretty tight and don't really feel floaty like other small titles end up. It's not as difficult as Rogue Legacy so it's less likely to frustrate new comers to the genre.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe enemy AI is very stupid. I mean honestly you can beat the final boss by making him step on spikes over and over. Not all abilitis are created equal. For the most part I beat the game with confusion alone. It's very short. To be honest when I found out level 10 was the end boss I was shocked. I mean the levels aren't very long. It's probably possible to finish the game in two hours or less for someone who's already amazing at Rogue Legacy. I guess it doesn't over stay it's welcome that way, but honestly it was off putting to know I had reached the end so quickly. There is still new game plus mode granted, but still. The story... well basically it doesn't have one.\n\nConclusion:\nIt's a good game if your just looking for a few hours of fun especially if you liked Rogue Legacy. It's easy to ignore the bad AI, short length, and no real story just because it's still fun at the end of the day.\n\nValue:\nI probably wouldn't fork over more then $3.

The only problem with this game is that it crashes all the time. This wouldn't be so bad if you could just pick up where you left off, perhaps at the start of the level, from when it crashed. Unfortunately it doesn't work that way. You lose your hero and are forced to reroll a new one as if they had died. This is immensly frustrating as it can take a while to build up a hero and advance through the 10 levels in the game. At most I've gotten to the end of the 6th level only to have a crash just as I beat the boss. The money you earned stays though but that's not really any consolation if you were doing a run to try and beat the game. In those situations you won't have all that much money because you'll have been spending it on one run only buffs at shrines.\n\nAs long as the game is this unstable I can't recommend it.","September 17, 2015","false","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game plays somewhat like a 2D sidescroller, except vertically. Overall, the game is not hard despite it being a roguelike, but it bodes well for this game. You are presented with randomly generated heros to begin with each run. They have different abilities and traits that can be purchased during runs.

On the way down you can kill enemies to level your character up, collect coins for upgrades, and buy random upgrades and teleporters to skip earlier levels. Now you don’t have to kill anyone, in fact game rewards you for decided not to do so. As long you go through the level without killing the game is in Pacifist mode where you can collect extra XP to level you character up.\n\nThe kicker however is that when you die that character and his level progression is over with and reset. At the start of the next game you begin you pick a new character who starts at level 1. Though that makes it the basic rougelike game your powers and abilities you buy do carry over between all characters if they are able to use them.\n\n\n\nThe graphics look great with a bright crisp almost cartoon like look to them. Thankfully the game controls just as well with the only times I found myself complaining of getting hurt was because of being my fault or just some odd level choices.\n\nThrough my several hours in the game the more I leveled up and got further the more fun the game got. You become stronger each time and gain new powers to make the game easier.

Very easy to get into with simple responsive controls, with just enough depth to provide replayablity.

It is a procedurally generated dungeon crawler, what kids might call a "roguelike" (if they've never played Rogue or any of its true derivatives like Nethack). The twist on this title is that maps run from the top down with only limited ways to re-ascend after you've fallen a given distance. This makes it play like Kid Icarus in reverse. Heroes can be improved upon generationally a la Rogue Legacy.\n\nSprites are cute and well designed, putting me in mind of Castle Crashers or Battleblock Theater. Sounds are good with catchy music. Control is fair, befitting the origin as a flash title, but it's suitable for the style of game and a touch of blockiness doesn't feel out of place.\n\nI can definitely recommend this for people who like games that have long replay value.\n\nFor: Fans of Tallowmere, Rogue Legacy, Battleblock Theater\nNot for: People demanding polish, fov sliders, surround sound effects.","August 3, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
