Either solo or with a 2-4 member party you hack and slash your way through 4 unique acts which have levels (and bonus levels) within them. New enemies are progressively introduced as well as having a boss level at the end of each act. There are five character classes for you to choose from (Knight, Wizard, Ranger, Warlock and Thief) and each character has its own unique trait specific to its class.\n\nWith all of the above being said, the game can be quick to get repetitive unless you switch it up often with the characters and the pre-game options. (Such as, shared mana pools, no hp pick ups, no extra lives etc.) I found the game to be most fun when at its most challenging. However, even though the game is repetitive, you can definitely burn quite a good few hours with it: I've played around 60 hours and I still plan on playing more.\n\nAnother problem I encountered is more of a community issue. Unless you have friends who want to play with you already or if you happen to be lucky at a certain time of day, jumping into a random game doesn't often get you very far. People are quick to just kick you instantly - which once or twice isn't so bad but I've actually given up on playing the game completely on a number of occasions because everyone that was online just kicked me. However it's not all bad, as I have made quite a few good friends that I wouldn't have had before without this game.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone wanting a fun dungeon-crawler to play that you can enable or disable the roguelike feature at will.","June 28, 2014","true","57.6"," 197 of 208 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","197","208","0","10"

At one point about two hours in we found ourselves in a situation where we had to deal with one of those lurkers that shoot spikes from the ground. To give our ranger the space to kill the lurker we needed to clear away all of the giant worms that were guarding it. Our thief ran in, threw his knives to get the worms' attention, then ran back around the corner where my paladin was waiting. As the worms circled around the corner to chase our thief they ran into my sword, and while a couple managed to poison me, our priest standing behind me had his healing beam running to keep me topped off. We killed off the horde and the ranger gave us the all-clear that the lurker was dead and the rest of us joined him in the lurker's lair to clear out to the booty.\n\nIt was at this moment I said over voice chat to my friends, "This game is awesome.

From the comfortable pixel-art visuals, to the simple Gauntlet-style gameplay, I spent a good number of hours playing just through half of the game's basic campaign with a few friends and enjoyed it. Each choosable class feels different from one another, and as you progress, you can further your abilities to defeat swarms of tougher monsters. There's a few problems with the game, such as graphic bugs here and there, but they're few and far between. Top it off with a map editor that has as much potential as a set of dev tools, and Hammerwatch is definitely worth the $10.","November 25, 2013","true","6.1"," 221 of 256 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","221","256","0","0"

Game is fantastic!  It's so simple in setup, yet so god damn challenging in execution.  I find it super addicting.\n\nThere's so many game types combined here, I think that's what makes it so addicting to me.  In some aspects, it's pure hack and slash dungeon crawler.  Then you run into another type of monster, and it's a bit like a bullet hell shooter.  Then you get your exploration jones.  You get some simple puzzles.  Spike mazes.  All sorts of stuff!  They change it up a bit in that you're not gaining xp and levels, but you're hunting every shiny gold piece you can find to level up your skills, keeping it from being bogged down in stats and number crunching.\n\nI've played just under 2 hours and I think I'm on floor 2.  My only slight concern is that everything keeps looking the same in the further levels, as in the drab green and brown pain job.  This isn't even that big of a concern though, since the exploring's done pretty well and just the sheer fact of pressing on so you can find a save state is a pretty strong drive.  I just hope there's some other even cooler environments later on!","August 30, 2013","true","9.1"," 169 of 206 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","169","206","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pakkidis/recommended/239070/","Pakkidis","Pakkidis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pakkidis/","1250 products in account","Rating: 8/10\nOverview: Top down Hack and Slash\n\nThe Good\n\n+The game has 6 main characters: paladin, ranger, wizard, warlock, priest and thief. Each character has their own unique combat traits, skills and passive abilities. Playing with different characters to see how they play differently is part of the fun. Collecting gold throughout the game allows you to unlock new skills and abilities from shop vendors.\n\n+The main game is split into 4 acts. Each act contains 3 dungeon levels. Each level contains a seal that you have to unlock to fight the boss for each act. Every level on the dungeon contains secrets and hidden passage ways. Exploring and finding these secrets is rewarding.\n\n+The bonus campaign is handled differently and just as fun. This bonus campaign is much less linear and allows you travel back to previously visited levels, it is also much harder. Sadly, you cannot transfer your main character to this campaign.\n\n+The game pushes a ton of enemies on screen. The pixelated graphics work really well in that regard.\n\n+Cool boss battles\n\n+Steam workshop support means there are plenty of custom maps you can play\n\n+The multiplayer community is still active and I was always able to find and join a game easily.\n\n\nThe Average\n\n-difficulty achievements do not stack\n\nThe Bad\n\n- The game can get very repetitive at times. Unlike most ARPG's this game doesn't have a robust character creation making things somewhat boring after awhile. This game has no loot providing little incentive to kill all the enemies. I found myself playing in short sessions simply because the game play formula started to wear thin the farther I went along.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a game you play to try out different characters that fit your play style and then kill wave after wave of enemy as you progress through the level. If that excites you then this is a game for you. This game is ARPG lite and for the most part, works very well but if you are looking for something with a bit more depth you may be disappointed with what this game has to offer.\n","February 2, 2015","true","30.6"," 62 of 65 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","62","65","4","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tawnylawns/recommended/239070/","tawnylawns","Tawny Lawns 💗","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tawnylawns/","1734 products in account","TL;DR - Brilliant dungeon crawler, simple yet fairly strategic. Play with others if you can.\n\n\nChoices with pernicious consequences call for sacrifices to be made from the very start of Hammerwatch. It is a rich blend of HnS and RPG. Superbly it preserves the riot of strategic elements within role playing games while maintaining non-complex arcade-like features of any good hack and slash through making use of basic skill upgrades and combat, loot usage and simple story progression alike (the patch expansion, Temple of the Sun is a bit more story orientated).\n\n\nChoices must be made, and self-sacrifices be willing.\n\nAn openly avid indie game collector and player, my dirty little secret is an obsession with enjoying indie co-op and multiplayer games (online and local). It's dirty and a secret (well, up till now) because I'm a sporadic multiplayer and don't consistently play with other people. Hammerwatch is of a select few which lure me out of the mole hole, blinking against the raging sun. And this is one furious Sol as people will curse you for your mistakes if not careful. Like I have mentioned, sacrifices and choices must be made and other than a secret puzzle in the game, Hammerwatch should not be played reliant on chance (unless you want a quick but painful death). Nothing here is eternal (unless you cheese or cheat for some wild reason). Though Hammerwatch has solid single player, and campaigns can be beaten at a similar difficulty level to that with any number of players in a team (2-4), it's a game which shines when you're fighting off the baddies together. It will also feel less tedious as being all alone in a dungeon can get mighty lonely, long and arduous. Co-op forces you to make choices that directly affect your teammates and may free or crush them. This makes it crucial to comprehend early on the definition of teamwork as you cannot just play as you please with friends and hope they'll clean up after you or that it won't matter as long as you keep eating fruit and meat and hoard lots of gold by cheesing between dungeon entrances (nooooo). You will literally get into altercations with friends if you do not pay attention to what you're doing and why. Gold is divided equally between each player but lives are pooled together. If you waste your lives or gold for selfish reasons your team will die. On the bright side, for such games reliant on skill, efficiency and the cost of your actions, Hammerwatch is relatively forgiving. Had it not been made so forgiving and added procedural level generation and perma death* it undoubtedly would have made a flawless roguelike.\n\n*Note: You can add challenges through the modifiers menu to make it seem similar to a roguelike with perma death at least. Crutches on the other hand aren't needed.\n\n\nIf you enjoy games like the Diablo series and have a fond memory of the more classic action adventure games in The Legend of Zelda series you will thoroughly enjoy Hammerwatch. I play this smashing title with my SO and expect we'll get plenty more hours than we have so far at a measly 15. There are two separate main campaigns and survival/custom modes as well. It is fun to go through the different classes to compare play tactics as they differ for each level and boss. Although my SO is rarely sold on any game I bring up (I play some odd indie games...), the moment I described Hammerwatch as dungeon crawling, he was on it in a heartbeat and never looked back. The mechanics are simple but by the end of a level, both hands will be aching like heck. This arises from the downside of this game where players are often required to press four keys together or in close succession and not much better variation from key binding to relieve this especially for some classes. Though I've only ever tried medium level so far and even on that the last level of the first campaign went a bit crazy because we had to press the bloomin' button, hard mode still sounds like great fun and will definitely be played.\n\n\nOn the subject of balmy levels, the uniformity of blazing energy balls, poisonous spit, spike traps beneath your feet and arrows whizzing past your head every second as well as ever spawning ticks nipping at your ankles and minibosses that don't seem so mini when clumped to excess will frequently lead you to reminisce the non-stop craziness of shoot 'em up games with lasers blazing in all directions trying to kill you. Oh yes, the shooters we'd mastered so cleverly only for being an eight year old too poor to play much else at the arcade... ah no... wait, so deprived of pocket money (from spending it all on crisps?) that we'd honed our own expertise by ever watching the screen of the older children bashing the keys like maniacs with little skill. At least the knowledge will aid us in Hammerwatch while all the bad guys focus all their energy on you, all at once. But soon enough you'll snap back from your nice little stroll down memory lane and WHAM, you'll be dead and your bodily remains will decorate the ground in a pile of fizzled heroic dungeon crawling, like a bomb blew inside you. The death reminds me of how vampires die in the HBO version of True Blood, a neat pile of gore on the floor which is quite adorable in an 8-bit influenced game such as this. The zombie-like skeletons will literally surround you in a tight circle *shivers* if your mind ever drifts and you will be mauled to death and ripped to shreds in the manner of season 5, episode 14 of The Walking Dead (RIP Noah and Aiden). Leaving more popular culture references aside, with everything considered Hammerwatch is delightfully difficult as you progress yet will never make you rage quit because it is merely too entertaining. The secret rooms and Easter eggs will also add to the fun so you can keep your eyes peeled for the walls and buttons as well, and not just kill, kill, KILLL.\n\n\n\n\nExtra Tips for Hammerwatch\n- Rangers are great to start off and the most versatile against enemies and traps for beginners. Personally I like warlocks as their power increase is much more intense further on, helping make swifter and heavier attacks for large mobs and swarms which more combat based classes just cannot pull off. Obviously this depends on your style of play so test everything in single player. It is also fun to try many different combinations with friends as it will change gameplay extensively.\n\n\n- If you're an experienced player, start off in co-op rather than flying solo. Proficient as a single player game, but with many games that have an excess of multiplayer excitement, Hammerwatch is such an addictive co-op game that you'll likely prefer it as one if you have someone you'd like to play with. It's easy to get into and forgiving at the beginning so definitely a blast for players to jump in even without knowing a thing.\n\n\n- Use port forwarding, Hamachi or Tunngle. Hammerwatch has local multiplayer which means you or a friend may need to host a server or you'll need to join someone else's server (hosted by them) unless you're playing alone. This requires port forwarding, which if you can do you probably wouldn't have read this far. It is handy for a lot of fantastic multiplayer games which do not offer online multiplayer. But don't fret if Googling port forwarding and not getting too far hinders your progress in having some fantastic time with friends. I'd suggest trying LogMeIn Hamachi as it is quick and easy for tech dummies (you'll need to download and create an account), and clean and efficient as long as everyone legitimately owns the game and you're not stealing someone else's connection to begin with. Tunngle is also a great option as well as is just sticking to port forwarding.\n\n\n\nEdited for format and note","May 24, 2015","true","36.9"," 67 of 77 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","67","77","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/239070/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The story of Hammerwatch truly is a modern masterpiece in storytelling. As the campaign begins, the line "The small bridge broke behind you...there is probably no way out!" is displayed. And that's it. That's the plot. Hammerwatch isn't the type of game that really needs a plot, however. The fact that the bridge broke and there is probably no way out is actually a decent introduction to the game as a whole: a light-hearted, if not a bit shallow, romp. In addition to the campaign, there is also a wave-based defense mode and the inclusion of a level editor for creating custom levels.\n\noing its best to harken back to classic Gauntlet, Hammerwatch is a cooperative hack-and-slash action game. There are four classes to choose from: Paladin, Warlock, Ranger, and Wizard. Each class starts with a regular attack as well as a special attack that drains a certain amount of magic points. More special attacks are eventually unlocked, though it takes a bit too long to actually earn them. In my experience, nothing comes close to the effectiveness of a Ranger since their default attack pierces through enemies - continuing its trajectory to harm even more enemies - and their bomb special attack is perfect for kiting and killing large groups of enemies at a time.\n\nt's also possible to strafe while moving, which is perhaps the most important thing to take away from this review if you buy Hammerwatch, as it’s not immediately apparent within the game. Mastering the strafe-and-attack is crucial for any class' survivability, since moving diagonally while attacking is so freaking useful.\n\nThere are a handful of secrets, puzzles, and obstacles that don't necessarily require fighting at all. Hidden rooms permeate each floor, and if the player keeps an eye out they should be able to find just about all of them. Puzzles are never too difficult, and in fact sometimes they are insultingly easy. These variants do a good job of breaking up the monotonous wave-clearing gameplay that makes up most of Hammerwatch.\n\nPlaying alone feels hollow, since a large part of the difficulty comes in the form of more and more of the same types of enemies being thrown at the player - a challenge that's far easier to enjoy when in the company of friends. Single-player reveals the game's shallow mechanics; movement and two attacks don't really make for the most compelling gameplay.\n\nProgression comes from a variety of vendors throughout the levels. Early on it is a very linear progression since only certain vendors are available. The first upgrade is the ability to combo, which allows players who kill at least 10 enemies in a row very quickly to gain a temporary boost to their stats. Later upgrades will build off of this, making it easier to combo and giving better benefits for comboing. By the end of the second act, players will finally have access to more special moves as well as having a little more open-endedness to their character's build.\n\nThe problem is that the end of the second act is a decent chunk of game away -- especially for players going it alone. While the level design is very open-ended and non-linear, the character progression is the exact opposite and takes way too long to become interesting. It can feel like forever when slogging through the seemingly endless waves of enemies with the basic attacks, waiting for something cool or interesting to happen.\n\nThis is where the bosses come in. After a pretty easy time mowing down countless enemies, the first boss steps in and SMASHES YOUR FACE INTO THE GROUND. Seriously, the difficulty shift from regular enemies to boss fights is gigantic! The bosses are quite challenging, but don't cross the line into becoming unfair (though this can easily depend on the player's class). The bosses utilize genuinely interesting mechanics for the most part and are a real blast to play through cooperatively.\n\nBesides adjusting the difficulty, there are a variety of modifications that players can include to make the game way harder or way easier, or both! Things like limiting all players to 1 HP per life, removing mana regeneration, and allowing no extra lives can make the game super difficult if that's what you're into. On the other hand, you can add infinite lives, HP regeneration, and double damage if you just want to breeze through the entire game and not worry about a thing. The amount of options, gameplay or otherwise, is really delightful and a beautiful sight to behold.\n\nPlaying cooperatively can be done locally or online, the latter of which doesn't require sharing the same screen. Playing online does tend to stutter a bit, but never so much that it affects the gameplay in any meaningful way. The worst thing that seemed to happen was that it would look like my buddy got hit by those spikes, but on his end he was just fine. Just be warned ahead of time: you may need to open router ports if you want to host a game.\n\nThe default controls for the keyboard are okay, but if you've got a controller you're going to want to use it. The keyboard uses WASD for movement and the arrow keys for attacks. However, the arrow keys don't attack in their respective direction; they just each perform a different attack in whichever direction the character is facing. So, the up arrow will always use the basic attack in front of the character. It can get confusing since naturally players will think that the up arrow attacks upwards, but I suspect that most people will get used to it easily enough. Plus, the controls can be remapped, so everyone can find something that works for them.\n\nThe game does look very nice, as the pixel art is some of the best I've seen. It's basic enough to allow me to reminisce about the old NES days while providing enough detail and animation to really look fluid and alive. The enemy design is generally nothing special, but I love that it is immediately apparent when a stronger version of a previous enemy arrives just by looking at it. The audio is likewise great, but there is no fading in and out of music tracks; one will end abruptly and another will begin, causing a very rough and noticeable transition.\n\nThe deciding factor for Hammerwatch depends on if you’re planning on playing it cooperatively. If you've got a buddy or two who would play through the game with you and you enjoy some mindless hacking and/or slashing, then it will not disappoint.\n\nAs a solo venture, the game can feel boring and tedious as it starts off way too slowly, despite throwing in some interesting boss fights later on. My recommendation is that you play it with friends, chat over some third-party voice program, and forget about your worries as you mindlessly slay hundreds upon hundreds of worms and skeletons and bugs and bats.","November 10, 2015","true","12.7"," 58 of 65 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","58","65","3","0"

They put in auto attack but it was too slow to benefit. I gave up on the game and just recently installed it again to see if they fixed it and yes, now auto attack is very fast. On the surface this is one of the most amazing indie games that has ever been made with some outstanding music. However it can get pretty repetitive.

Has that old school rpg look while incorporating smooth and responsive modern day controls. I'm sure this is a good game to play solo. Though I'd highly recommend playing it with a friend. As any shared experience is always the more fun one. And with this game dropped down to £1.74 on winter/summer sales. There really is no reason not to treat a friend to this game (Though you're really treating yourself to a more enjoyable experience).\n\nHammerwatch currently has six classes with ranged and/or close quarters attacks. With each having a magic spell or ability and other ones unlocking later in the game. Multiple upgrades including health, mana, armour, damage, and many more. Seven dungeons which include multiple layers and have seven challenging bosses to go with each.

It offers you exactly what you would expect from hack and slash genre plus a few extra things. I am yet to find more enjoyable game where all you do is run around and kill stuff. The secret areas are a different thing though.\n\nI believe this is my first game of its genre and I must say I enjoyed it a lot. There are 6 classes to choose from. All give you different abilities and game strategies. There are no skill trees, instead you can purchase your skills and stats from the shopkeepers during the game. There are different possible combos for every class. You will have to look for hidden doors, which is not always easy. Sometimes you have to go around 1 level a few times to actually see everything and find out if something moved due to your actions. Game keeps you in pace. Closer to the end the pace of killing enemies and you dying becomes a bit faster. I must say that the game is actually not frustrating at all. You enjoy every gold coin you find to spend on yourself.\n\nThe sound is very not friendly to new users. You have to install a program yourself, which is actually located in the files, but it does not tell you where and why. Without sound this game would actually suck. But, once you get it going it's just amazing. It makes the gameplay so much better and gives you a feel of really old game. I found a bug, when you get to special are the sound from previous area plays together with the new area's sound. Otherwise, the music is very pleasant and I have not grown tired of it at all.\n\nGraphically the game looks like it was made for SEGA during 90's, but it's still a modern game. You can actually adjust the post effects so that you game looks not even 90's but 80's. You can get a rounded yellowish screen, how about that for a change on your nice flat screen huh? Everything you see is perfectly understandable and there are no visuals artifacts because the graphics are so simple. In all, graphical solution adds up to the feel you get while playing Hammerwatch.\n\nControlls in general are a fine, but can be a bit wonky for some classes like range for example. Shooting and walking can be a bit of nuisance sometimes. There's only like 8 buttons to push, so you should be fine with any character to be honest.\n\nReplayabilty is under question. I guess once you finish the game with every class there's not much to do unless you gather friends to play online.\n\nIn the end the game is so good for the offered price. I would even say that buying the game at a full price is not going to disappoint you.","December 13, 2014","true","10.9"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","34","37","0","0"

With amazing music composed by Two Feathers, plus the Online Multiplayer Co-op Adventure, this game hands down is one of my favorite pixelated dungeon crawlers to date!\nIMPORTANT: This is more of a informational review that won't be going into the game-play.\nThere are now two campaigns that you can play-through in this game.\nCastle HammerWatch: The first and original campaign. Recommended to playthrough at least once before moving on to other campaigns\nTemple of the Sun: The second campaign or Expansion campaign made by the HammerWatch developers. With lots of new mechanics compared to the first one.\n\nThere are 3 different difficalty settings.\nEasy/Easier: Enemies do less damage and die easier.\nMedium: Standard difficulty.\nHard: Only for very skilled players.\n\nThere are now currently 6 Very unique classes all that play an important role.\nThere is the Paladin, a melee fighter with good mobility and high defense.\nWizard a ranged spell caster with good area of effect damage.\nRanger a versatile fighter with long range. Recommendd for new players.\nWarlock a melee spell caster who can replenish health.\nThief a high damage melee fighter with low defense.\nPriest a ranged spell caster with good defense who can heal.\n\nLike I said all these classes play an important role when playing multiplayer and is recommended not to have more than one of each class, one is enough.\n\nMy take on the game:\nI play Paladin 95% of the time and I am at the best of my game when I play as him, He is a good class to have on your team of adventures. His shield can block projectiles which can be very helpful for your teamates who don't have a shield. As the name says, the Paladin does have a healing ability, some may say that his healing ability is better than the Priest's, but that is another arguement for another day. In general the Paladin is a "Hero" among the other characters and I reccommend that you always have at least one Paladin on your team.  But, this is coming from some who almost always play Paladin and this is just my opinion, but remember it's your choice whether or not to have one.\n\nConclusion:\nIn my opinion I recommend this game to anyone who loves hack and slash action adventure games. It's an amzing game well done. And before you could argue that the price was not worth it because there was only 1 campaign but now there are two to playthrough. If you buy this game, I guarantee you will have a fun time playing it. It's one of the best hack and slash adventure games of all time in my opinion. ;)\n\nI hope you found this review helpful.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/239070/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Hammerwatch is a game that feels like an old school (and intentionally looks like one) hack-and-slash game similar to Gauntlet. The story consists of one box of text at the beginning: "The small bridge broke behind you...there is probably no way out!" From there, your job is to kill and collect anything in your path and stay alive. When I was younger I used to play the hell out of the Nintendo 64 version of Gauntlet, it was fun when I took on the levels alone, but things really got going when a friend or three joined. Hammerwatch is similar. Due to the non-existent story, your motivation for moving forward is take your selected character from a choice of a Paladin, Warlock, Wizard and Ranger and take them to the end.\n\nPlaying alone, Hammerwatch is fun enough, fighting large groups of enemies as a lone Ranger, wiping out hundreds of bugs and creatures. The first act of the game is quite lengthy, where the constant killing and exploring for secrets slowly turns into looking for the way out. Fortunately there are save points around the world so when I began to burn out I could come back later refreshed and ready to go on. There are RPG elements in the game in the form of upgrading your attacks and adding in combos. At times I forgot that I could alter my skills, as it felt way too long between finding the vendors that I can purchase the skills from. Initially you have a basic attack and a special attack that feeds off of your magic meter. With combos added you gain bonuses such as health regeneration after killing 10 enemies in short time.\n\nGoing with old style pixel art, Hammerwatch pulls it off well and feels like a game you could have been playing in the 90's. The music works as well. For controls you can use the keyboard or controller. I recommend using a controller if you have one over using the keyboard. Not that the keyboard is a bad way to play, but I found dual sticks the way to go.\n\nPlaying co-op can be done by sharing the same screen or online. If you can, plug your computer/laptop up to a TV or have a big screen - sharing a screen can be good fun with a group of friends together. Online is great for if your friends aren't nearby or it's hard to get people together. The online experience isn't always smooth, there is stutter at times and a few graphical hiccups but neither really impact on the game and really I can't remember the last time I played an online game that ran super smooth so it's hard to knock Hammerwatch for the same.\n\nIf you feel that you are up to some level editing that is available too, you can tailor make levels that you and your friends will enjoy. If you just want to make the game harder or easier there are sliders to adjust.\n\nThere's not much to dislike about Hammerwatch unless you hate having fun, it's a fun Gauntlet style game; great fun with two to four people and fun enough playing it alone. Combined with some nice 'retro' visuals and good music to quest to, with the game editor you shouldn't run out of content anytime soon.\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 9, 2014","true","49.0"," 44 of 60 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","44","60","0","0"

It's like an oldschool Gauntlet game with RPG elements mixed in. It's great for co-op gameplay, but perhaps too difficult in singleplayer.\n\nThe way they balanced the different classes is quite amazing - each one has strengths and weaknesses that go beyond arbitrary mathematics. For instance, the Warlock has great AoE spells, but struggles to kill spawners, turrets, and bosses. The Ranger is great at killing spawners, turrets, and bosses from afar, but has trouble taking on enemy archers in large numbers. The Paladin can block enemy projectiles (archers? no problem!), but can't cope as well with masses of enemies and turrets. The wizard has very little health, but is great at taking out groups of enemies and their spawners, as long as he's not overwhelmed. It's a bit tough to put into words how great the variety between the classes feels, but these strengths and weaknesses are one reason why it helps to bring friends.\n\nMy only gripe with the game is that the levels are all manually created (no random generation option), so they might not be as fun to play through multiple times. They're still adding content to the game, so it looks like there will be more to play in the future.  There's a level editor so the community can create additional content for it, but it's a bit more difficult to use than I expected - you can't just whip up some new levels with minimal effort.\n\nOverall, it's a great experience with friends. Fun for couch co-op or online multiplayer.

If you're wise and cautious, you'll be rewarded with large swathes of treasure and the satisfying feeling you get when the enemies finally crumble before your ire.\n\nI'd highly recommend this to any person enthusiastic about the "golden ages" of dungeon crawlers. The main campain will take at least 20 hours to clear if you search far and wide for all the secrets; and there is even an expansion offering an entire additional dungeon.

The endless dungeon crawling should get tedious, but it doesn't. The lack of variety in enemies should get boring. The oh-so slow grind of upgrading powers should be faster. The huge difficulty spikes of boss battles should be frustrating.\n\nBut somehow, Hammerwatch manages to be more than the sum of it's parts, and provides an answer to all of the potential failings I've mentioned.  The lack of variety in enemies is offset by the fact that there's an enormous number of them, which come at you in various combinations, and the interaction with the level design keeps each encounter fresh. While the character upgrades are very slowly drip-fed, that means that you have ample time as the player to master nuances of each before having more powers laden on. The boss difficulty spikes are offset by the fact that the game provides you plenty of extra lives, notably handing you a stack of five at the end of each boss fight, presumably to make up for the slew of them you lost during said fight.\n\nIt's that balance that only starts to shine through a few hours into the game. Hammerwatch rewards and demands careful, smart play. Wade into a battle without an exit strategy in mind and you'll quickly be swamped by 50 enemies. Get surrounded, and you're toast. But go in knowing that you've cleared the hallway behind you so you can retreat that way, kiting the enemies into a more manageable grouping, and that you can trigger a combo with one power and use a combination heal/AoE with the other. and you'll stroll through the encounter.\n\nThe only possible downside is that once you've got your build mastered and your careful approach strategy down, the challenge can slacken off (with the exception of the punishing boss battles). Though to be fair, there are harder difficulty levels that I've not yet explored that may solve that issue.\n\nI'll also note that I haven't even tried the co-op, which I expect will change up the feel of the game dramatically.","May 4","true","23.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

The various skill effects are also nice. In fact, there is enough detail in the levels to reward explorers and those with attention-to-detail - there are a large amount of secret areas to find.

The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with dungeon crawlers - one of the most difficult parts of the game is being able to effectively micro and dodge enemy attacks (especially since you will encounter endless amounts of mobs throughout the levels). The game plays a lot better if you are playing multiplayer, but singleplayer mode is still a lot of fun.\n\nGameplay consists of you navigating through (what seems to be) non-randomized levels, killing enemies and picking up many collectibles like gold, keys (bronze, silver, gold), health and mana, and a variety of other things. There are secret rooms that may give level shortcuts, allowing you to bypass a decent section of the map. The game is fairly linear, however, it really rewards exploration. You will encounter merchants that provide mana/health bonuses, combo enhancements (achieve a kill combo to produce numerous effects), new abilities, etc. These merchants will offer you a % discount based on how many shop tokens you have, and many of these are located in secret areas and secondary routes. There are also a number of puzzles and traps, requiring you to manipulate pressure blocks most of the time in different ways.\n\nThere are different classes to play, easily warranting multiple playthroughs. This also makes playing with a group lots of fun because watching the different abilities massacring mobs of enemies can be really satisfying. There is some varying degree of difficulty depending on who you choose to play as. For example, the thief deals massive melee damage, but is also extremely weak with low health. The warlock (my favorite) has a melee attack that also poisons the target, causing damage over time and a weak explosion upon death. He starts off with a chain lightning ability for clearing mobs.\n\nThe variety of shop upgrades offers a bit of strategic diversity. For example, one of the first upgrades is a combo enhancement - so achieving 10 consecutive kills will cause your character to move faster and deal more damage (very short amount of time). You can then upgrade things like health and mana, or you can choose to make your combo timer longer. You can also buy things like bonuses to offence (a rapid-fire nova when you achieve a combo), or a healing buff instead. Upgrades are initially expensive, so exploring a lot will help you upgrade effectively - especially when you find more shop discount tokens.\n\nOverall, the game is a lot of fun - especially if you play with other people. If you are the least bit interested in the dungeon crawling genre, then you must give this a try.\n\nDefinitely recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","February 25, 2015","true","2.5"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","1"

It is really addicting and VERY fun to play, solo or with friends. The setup of the multiplayer is really easy and there are different game-modes in the default pack and you can download a few more on the official site.\nThe only thing i was bothered by is the imbalance of the classes. I have 3 other friends who played it solo or with each other and we all agree that the ranger is the class you can easily get very far with. The second one but still immensely weaker is the wizard. The melee classes(paladin and warlock) are just way too underpowered.\n\nBut I still have 30h+ playtime already, mostly with the ranger and the wizard. I do not regret buying this game AT ALL.\n\n9/10","November 27, 2013","true","55.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","3"

Alone or online with up to three friends, choose one of 6 different classes and work your way through Castle Hammerwatch, filled with traps, secrets, and of course thousands of monsters to destroy, while spending your hard earned gold on upgrades for your characters.\n\nHammerwatch is at its normal or hard difficulties a punishing, yet rarely unfair game that gives a real sense of mastery as you get better, but it also has an easy difficulty as well as custom mutators you can set to tailor your game experience exactly how you like it.\n\nThe game is presented in simple top down 2D sprite graphics that have a retro feel to it, which may be offputting to some but I personally adore the art style.  The controls are simple, the action is fast and the Castle itself is very well designed with tons of secrets and puzzles to solve between all the killing.\n\nI'm having a great time playing this game, at time of writing having finished the main game in a private co-op group and just getting started on the (free) expansion.  While the game is fun if you're going it alone, it definitely shines the brightest in multiplayer, especially if you want to play a melee character as certain situations are very, very tricky to pass without proper ranged damage.\n\nWhile I haven't looked at it myself yet, there is also a level editor included and the Steam Workshop has a whole bunch of community created adventures you can play, potentially adding a heckton of hours to the longevity of the game.\n\nIf you see the game at a discount somewhere I can safely recommend a purchase if you like some throw back, uncomplicated dungeon crawling action.  Especially so if you have a few friends you can pass around 4 pack copies to and drag along for the fun!","April 8","true","28.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The game starts off by allowing players to pick between 1 of 4 classes and from there they begin to progress through the dungeon in order to achieve...well that goes unsaid.  There's plenty of enemies to slay which come from spawns, each 'hero-type' has a unique ability unique to them that comes some mana.\n\nWhat I enjoyed about the game was its simplicity yet ability to punish the player for simple and silly mistakes.  Its also a good game in the 'time killing category' as the player can continue from the last checkpoint without too many concerns.  Another part of the game I enjoyed was a lack of leveling systems.  To upgrade your character one must collect gold and then find the respective vendor to upgrade a stat such as health, movement, armor and ability to execute combos (combos are created when you kill 10+ enemies in a row within a time frame and can be enhanced with difference effects such as self-heal or aoe radius attacks)\n\nSome items I was not a fan of was movement speed.  I honestly wish there was an built in button of some sort to allow for a dash (aside from one of the character specific skills).  Some points might be spent back tracking and as large as the maps are that can take a considerable amount of time.  This is particularly difficult when trying to locate switches or button that may have been overlooked.  The other element I didn't enjoy was the amount of boxes that required to be broken to find currency.  Currecy in this game is a finite source (as far as I know for the base campign) so you want to gather as much as possible.\n\nIn terms of connectivity I really can't say much.  The standard port opening/forwarding or utilizing a VPN may need to be done in order to connect to a server but I haven't really experience the game online.  In terms of controller support I didn't experience any real issue.  Set-up DS3 Tool configured it to recognize PS3 controllers as Xbox controller and was good to go.\n\nI'll have to give some of the level editors a go in the future.\n\nAt this time I really can't recommned or not recommend this game.  I would recommend it to those that enjoy grindy style games with a bit of customizations in terms of dungeons or if you want a quick game to play with a friend...but I wouldn't recommend it if your trying to play with a friend across the net if your not familiar with using say Hamachi or Tunngle or some other VPN protocol.","December 4, 2013","true","3.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crunchyfrog555/recommended/239070/","crunchyfrog555","crunchyfrog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crunchyfrog555/","822 products in account","It's fair to say that when one sees an Indie game (especially when for sale cheaply) one can lower one's expectations a bit. You might forgive some length of the game, or quality, or clunkiness in mechanics. This is one of those rarer games where NONE of that applies. It's extremely polished.\n\nAs others may well have commented, there's obvious parallels here to the old classic Gauntlet. I'm probably going to commit gaming heresy here, but I'll confess that Gauntlet was rather a mixed bag to me. As an arcade game that certainly popularised hack'n'slash (and there was so very little DnD related stuff in the arcades up until then), I loved it. I also loved the merits and fun in having 4 players crowd round the unit, each with their own controls, and I also loved the fact you could stick another 10p in to just add HP to your character, extending your progress.\n\nHowever, I disliked that it was obviously an arcade game, written with the emphasis of milking coins from you as quickly as they could get away with. You would often think "that was a fairly good and long game" only to realise you'd stuffed a quid's worth of 10p's in, where you'd probably get the same amount of game time on another game for half the price. This ias the main reason why I felt it never really translated well to home conversion.\n\nThankfully, Hammerwatch takes the best bits of Gauntlet, throws away the coin-stuffing problem, and improves on a few things too, making it very much it's own unique thing. It is, of course, very retro in nature - older, large-pixelled graphics, 2D view, low HP and more old-fashioned gameplay. However, these are not done for the sake of nostalgia - they perfectly fit, and are indeed designed very much around these premises.\n\nWhere the game truly shines are in mechanics - it's not-too-fast offers fluid movement, and solid nimble attacks. You soon pick up the distance from enemies which are best for bashing them, and the time-honoured tradition of funneling enemies works so very well here. In a nutshell, it just plays so beautifully.\n\nThere's no levelling up of character through XP. However, your character can be improved through amassing the tons of coins thrown around the place (you'll need them), and by visiting specific vendors. One quite lovely trick of the game is utilizing where these vendors are - a 2D map can easily fall prey these days to being quite old-fashioned and tired. Thankfully, due to where these vendors are, and that there are several exits and entrances to each level, you'll need to dart back and forth quite a bit, and it never really feels like a chore.\n\nPut simply, this game does very much "what it says on the tin", and does it brilliantly. It does adopt a traditional 3 lives system (extra lives can be earned), but you really feel that it is well-balanced, appropriately challenging and I never once felt that a death was cheap or anything other than my fault.\n\nIf that were not enough credit to it, then there's one massive one that is very dear to my heart, and that concerns difficulty. I openly admit to being an older gamer (I'm nearly 50) and disabled. A lot of the time, it doesn't really hinder my gameplay too much, although my reactions have naturally slowed a bit over the years. But I do have bad days, and there's nothing worse than starting a game, getting many hours into it and then having a bad day which means you simply cannot progress in that game because you're finding it too hard that day (and nothing takes your mind off the bad days better than gaming).\n\nSo, I'm a fan of the theory that you can NEVER have too many difficulty options. If you select the "vanilla" easier option when starting a game, you'll find Hammerwatch still quite challenging, and if you're used to the standard of what easy mode truly means, then you won't get to the end, most likely.\n\nHowever, you can tweak the difficulty even further, with "crutches" (strangely appropriate for me) - regenerating HP, double-damage just to name two main ones. Conversely, there are also the opposite - tricks to make the game harder still, such as no earning of extra lives and more. So, a number of options for anybody.\n\nIt's often a situation that I'll end up modding the INI files of some games due to inadequate difficulty settings, but the downside of this is it can often be a balancing act to get it just right for you without it destroying interest in the game. I found that these "crutches" were perfect for me - they made the game much easier, but kept it interesting enough even though only the stupidest of mistakes will leave you in trouble.\n\nIn summary, I can't recommend this game highly enough. It offers what you'd expect and much more. It is so very well polished and designed extremely well. With those added thoughtful difficulty settings, that really makes it a cherry on one delicate, but utterly more-ish cake.","January 1, 2014","true","5.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","4"

There's a campaign mode, survival mode, and a mode that is sort of like a tower defense, but the game supports custom content, so it really doesn't end there. Hammerwatch supports couch co-op (so it's an excellent Steam Machine candidate) and online co-op.\n\nThe classes are: Warrior, Wizard, Archer, Warlock and Thief. They all have their own upgrades that can be purchased in the various modes that improve their specialities, such as the Thief earning more money to use for skills, and the Warrior being able to upgrade their projectile blocking radius. Character upgrades persist through a campaign, but when a new campaign is started players start from scratch. The average campaign time is a few hours, and progress can be saved mid-campaign and resumed later.\n\nThe game is fun as a single player game, but it's at its best when when friends are involved.

It's very clear from the start that it pays homage to many games (in the form of easter eggs, too), including old classic arcade style games such as Gauntlet. Alone or with friends, it's a game like no other!\n\nFrom the start, it's a delight for the senses. The graphics have a retro yet "modern" look to them, featuring dynamic shadows and ambient occulsion that have absolutely every right to be there to enhance the crispy pixel visuals. The music, oh lord the music, is some of the greatest music I ever heard in a game. I don't know why it's so good, but "Two Feathers" is a brilliant composer and makes some of the best "epic retro game orchestral pop" music I've ever heard. Rolls off of the tongue, right?\n\nThe gameplay is a button mash fest. A very fun one! There is very little delay between attacks or abilities, making button mashing your way through hordes of enemies or pesky loot hiding crates an absolute dream! It's not even an easy game in the slightest, positioning and ability usage play a key role in your survival. Otherwise, you are going to get wrecked in this difficult game filled to the brim with monster hordes! When you aren't throwing yourself into a massive army of creatures, you will find tons of secrets, upgrade your abilities with money, and stumble upon a brilliant game design decision: Tease the player with loot that they can clearly see on screen but can't reach! All of this in huge, sprawling levels that might take hours to finish!\n\nHammerwatch is just a breathtaking little game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/239070/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nHammerwatch is a Dungeon crawler that takes you through 4 levels or “acts”. There are several different classes you can play as. The game feels like a throwback from older 8bit video games, while enjoyable to play occasionally, to try to power through the game was a bit excessive for my tastes (the game play was very repetitive).\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: There isn’t much of a story, you start the game out separated from your companions because “the bridge is out!” Because you simply couldn’t jump across that stupid bridge you had to wander throughout the four acts for several hours until you get to the last boss. (and at that point, I really hope you got all the planks, or else you’ll need to do it… AGAIN!)\n\nGame Play: Hammerwatch requires excessive spamming of my forward key (it would work better with a controller, or maybe rebinding the attack keys from the keyboard default). I understand that it’s my own fault for not taking the care to get a controller or rebind the key. But I preferred the default set up. I really got tired of spamming my forward arrow, while kiting around and holding down the space bar to strafe.\nAfter my 10th hour, it stopped being amusing and fun. I only played as the Ranger class; those of you who know me know I like to play Range classes in video games. In Hammerwatch the ranger seems to be rather over powered as well. There are several other classes that are really fun to try out though.\nMany dungeon crawlers the dungeon changes shape as you play, or they’re so big you cannot remember where anything else. I found myself getting very bored wandering around trying to get every single thing inside the dungeon. Worse yet; when you play the story mode a second time the dungeon doesn’t change at all. That made “exploring” pretty impossible for me, and finding secret area’s I had missed my first time playing only gives me so much of a thrill. Simply put: I felt like I was grinding, not playing a game.\n\nAchievements: The achievements are pretty straightforward. I earned all of them aside from two: don’t plan to get the last two “Slay the Lich achievements” until I have help, or I’m really, really bored with time to burn.\nThe achievements are three categories: 1) Beat the game/boss on _____ Difficulty. 2) Find the secret area. 3) Grind the ____ Amount of NPC’s/Gold. There are good guides in the steam community that assist with the secret areas, which for me was the most work. I had to redo the story mode part of the game Three times.\n\nPrice: Hammerwatch’s standard price is $9.99, I really didn’t enjoy playing this game solo that much. I’m sure it’s more fun with friends. I guess $9.99 is a fair price, but I think you can get a better game with more enjoyment out of it for that price. I would skip this game unless you really want to try out new games. My recommendation is to wait for a steam sale before you purchase the game.\n\nConclusion: Pro’s: The game was a fresh idea, it was fun to play through once and leave it alone. It was very easy on my graphic’s, I could play it on my laptop (most people could probably play it on their phone).\nCon’s: The game is very grindy in nature, I was quite tired of spamming my forward key to do attacks, I had to repeat the same story at least three times with no real dynamic differences between the dungeons or NPC’s I fought.\nI’m not sure if I should be giving this game a recommended or not recommended. I wouldn’t be telling the truth to say I was unsatisfied with the game. I don’t think that most people will get as much entertainment out of the game as I did, and like I’ve clearly outlined I felt like I was grinding most of my time. I would like to say I’m uncertain which way I lean.","May 4, 2014","false","92.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

I soon gave up on it though, because it felt dull.\n\nIt had been out a while and I decided to get it during the christmas sale. Sadly, I don't think it has improved much. Mind, I haven't played it a lot at the time of writing, so take it with a grain of salt.\n\nThe levels are designed, not randomly generated, which might hurt when it comes to replay value. The levels are very large, but are mostly empty. Most of the time you are smashing near-endless amounts of containers that primarily contain coins. The rest of the time is spent on effectively killing hordes of enemies in bullet-hell type of situations. There's a littlebit of puzzles and secrets sprinkled around, but not a whole lot it would seem. Checkpoints allow you to try again if you die, but you have limited lives. Reaching a new floor saves your progress.\n\nYou can select from a few different classes that behave quite differently. You can bring some friends with you in co-op mode if you wish. Sound-wise, there's not much to go on, but the art style is cool. Shops spread out in the dungeon allow you to purchase upgrades.\n\nWhat I find to be the issue with this game is than it's simply not a lot of fun. With an addition of randomly generated, faster-paced levels and more interesting things to do, the game would look a lot more interesting. I think it has potential, but the experience, as it is, doesn't allow me to recommend this game. If you still think you'll like it, or just want to show your support to the developers, consider getting it during a sale. The regular asking price is rather high.","January 2, 2014","false","1.8"," 21 of 39 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","21","39","0","0"

It's not the kind of game you can play casually. The game supports up to 4 players I believe, but you can't join somebody else's campaign midway.

There are 4 distinct classes to play as, and they each unlock different paths and methods of playing the game, so yet another piece in prolonging gameplay. Lastly, and favored mostly by me, is the level editor, which basically contains as much power as dev tools. It can be a bit confusing at first, and I still have trouble figuring out how to do some things, but it is very possible to continue on with experience.

If you get this game you will NOT be disappointed. I highly recommend it and think it's absolutely fun and amazing. It offers 4 player multiplayer co-op and the fun can last for hours on end. I recommend having a controller though as tapping the same button over and over for an attack and get repetitive and fast. The only other thing that this game doesn't have is online multiplayer saves. Say you reach a save point in a multiplayer session and it takes 5 hours to reach a certain point. If you save and then turn it off and then turn it back on try to get back to where you were, it won't let you and you'll have to restart from the beginning which is a super downer :(. However despite that, it's super fun and there is no other game like this on steam! It's fun, unique, and it has 6 different classes you can play as now!!! (it used to be 4 but with updates it's 6). There's plenty of content to explore and it offers a challenge every time you play it (unless you use cheats ;P) and not only that but you can even get mods for this game online making it even better offering different modes of play- and yes they all offer online multiplayer as well. Even if this game is full priced I HIGHLY recommend it, but I would say wait as this game does go on sale, and recently I saw it for .83 on indie gala during the spring sale recently and it also can drop down to other prices too like 2.50 so be sure to pick up this game when it's on sale.","May 29, 2015","true","19.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Choose a hero, hack through waves and waves of enemies, buy upgrades, kill even more enemies, get more upgrades, kill a boss, get to the next level, start the whole process over. However dull that may sound, player will often suffer from the "one more" syndrome - "I will wipe one more floor and I will go to bed", "I'll clear one more level and I'm going to do something else" - which prolongs the time one spends playing it.\n\nHammerwatch has a very pleasant art style. The graphics is pixelated (in a good manner) and generally looks quite pretty and also fits the dungeon crawler theme. The only problem would be some single coins being too small to notice when lying directly behind a wall.\n\nThe game seems to have lots of content - enemies, levels, secret areas, traps, puzzles, bosses, upgrades. But the gameplay itself is a little too shallow, so playing for more than 2 hours feels like a chore (and makes your fingers hurt for bashing the skill buttons). There is a level editor and Steam Workshop integration, so probably there are more fun scenarios to play rather than the original ones. There's also a multiplayer mode, which I had no chance to test and I deeply regret it because it looks like the game's value shines much brighter with it.\n\nThe game could use some improvements with loot system being the most important one in my opinion. Currently, there are only 4 things that can be picked up: gold, hp/mana pots, vendor coins and extra lives. Implementing some more interesting loot system could really improve the overall value of the game and increase the feeling of playing a good roguelike (luck based drops that sometimes set you up for a level and sometimes require specific play style to benefit). Lack of randomly generated worlds is also a little bit bummer, as it decreases replayability value a lot, however, it is understandable that some of the current elements (puzzles, secret areas) would just not work with generated floors so devs had to make a decision there.\n\nAs I said in the beginning, Hammerwatch is not a great game. However, it is often to be found at 90% discount (1€~), which is a crazy good price for a solid game like this one. I bought it on one of such occassions and I don't regret it. Paying the full price might be a bit to steep, though. All in all, I had some fun playing it and I will have some more, because I am not finished yet.\n","January 2, 2015","true","8.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At it's core, it follows the same 'find all of the keys to get to the exit' formula, but this gameplay is augmented by player progression, special abilities, backtracking, and boss fights. It's colorful, lots of great effects, and has a generally high production value.\n\nI'd also like to express a few issues I have with the game, but at the same time point out that these should not necessarily deter you from buying/playing the game, just give you a better idea of what to expect.\n\nFirst, there's no steamcloud support. To me this is a basic feature if you're going to put a game on steam.. it'd be forgivable if it were a roguelike with no persistence, but this is a long-play game. Anytime a game doesn't support steamcloud I have to copy the save to my dropbox before I go to work.\n\nThe decision to make the paladin the 'default' character for players who just start the game without changing options is questionable. The paladin takes a fair bit of skill and nuance to play effectively- not to mention that just about any other game that has a paladin gives that class some sort of healing ability. This paladin has a charge/dash. It's a great skill, but just not what people are going to expect when diving into the game for the first time. Your average player is going to start the game, get swarmed and die repeatedly. Personally I think the wizard probably would have made a better default character.\n\nThere is virtually NO onboarding in this game whatsoever. The closest you get to a 'tutorial' are these little 'hint boxes' that you have to attack, but if you happen to take a warp or staircase past the first floor (not as hard as it sounds) you'll never see them. An actual onboarding level or optional tutorial would go a long way to making the game more digestible for the average gamer. After my first 30 minutes of playing this game I nearly wrote an angry email to the friend who recommended I buy it, but I persevered and found the diamond in the rough.\n\nThe soundtrack is nice, but personally it doesn't gel with the art style. I feel like a retro chiptune style soundtrack would have fit better, but that's just my opinion. What's in the game is good, it's not distracting, so in the end it is what it is. I just feel like it's an area where they could have given the game a bit more personality.\n\nA lot of the encounters aren't really balanced for single player. It's clear to me that they are pushing for coop multiplayer for this game, but a bit more thought could have been given to making sure the singleplayer experience didn't suffer. It's not bad, mind you- I have a singleplayer game going right now and as an example- I was able to full-clear the first 3 floors without dying once, but during the first boss battle I died 9 times. It's not so much that the fight is hard, it's just that they spawn you right in the middle of an area where you're going to take damage immediately (and a low armor class is going to die quickly). So that's just an example, but you'll see little hints of it throughout the game. Not a huge deal, still very enjoyable as a single player game.\n\nSo, TLDR version: It's fun, great, awesome. Hard, steep learning curve. Stick with it and you'll love it.","January 3, 2014","true","16.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game appeals to the more nostalgic gaming crowd(such as myself) and gives them a game that looks and feels like one coming straight out of the 80's but has much more effects within the game and generally looks better than most of the 16-bit games prior what with all the technology today. The gameplay itself can be a bit of a challenge by yourself if not using any sort of handicaps but can certainly feel rewarding when accomplishing a dungeon or even just a floor of a dungeon, but the real fun lies when playing with friends. You can play up to four people on a single server that can be created very easily compared to most of the other pc games that i have played since no portforwarding is involved or anything of that nature; with that being said there are no dedicated servers either which is completely fine for a game like this. The four playable calsses each have some advantages and weaknesses which of course balance the game and variation of them will keep the dungeon crawling interesting. There is no voice chat support so your fingers will be more dedicated than ever to the keyboard if you are accustomed to using a microphone, but then again there are 3rd party software like skype and even the steam voice chat system to use. I only wish that there would be a system of picking and choosing which dungeon you would like to explore because i find myself wanting to start where i left off in multiplayer but must start from the beginning(this only applies to multiplayer). Although I really do enjoy the game I feel like the price is a bit high and suggest that when the game drops to a lower one(summer sales*) that should be the moment you buy it because the game, all-in-all, is pretty fun in all of its facilety.","April 3, 2014","true","23.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

This is a 2D Retro top-down dungeon crawler with an extremely large dungeon for you to explore. There is a limiting factor, however, in that every playthrough is based upon that same dungeon. But this doesn't stop the game from still being very fun. There are 4 distinct classes to play as, and they each unlock different paths and methods of playing the game, so yet another piece in prolonging gameplay. Lastly, and favored mostly by me, is the level editor, which basically contains as much power as dev tools. It can be a bit confusing at first, and I still have trouble figuring out how to do some things, but it is very possible to continue on with experience.

If you get this game you will NOT be disappointed. I highly recommend it and think it's absolutely fun and amazing. It offers 4 player multiplayer co-op and the fun can last for hours on end. I recommend having a controller though as tapping the same button over and over for an attack and get repetitive and fast. The only other thing that this game doesn't have is online multiplayer saves. Say you reach a save point in a multiplayer session and it takes 5 hours to reach a certain point. If you save and then turn it off and then turn it back on try to get back to where you were, it won't let you and you'll have to restart from the beginning which is a super downer :(. However despite that, it's super fun and there is no other game like this on steam! It's fun, unique, and it has 6 different classes you can play as now!!! (it used to be 4 but with updates it's 6). There's plenty of content to explore and it offers a challenge every time you play it (unless you use cheats ;P) and not only that but you can even get mods for this game online making it even better offering different modes of play- and yes they all offer online multiplayer as well. Even if this game is full priced I HIGHLY recommend it, but I would say wait as this game does go on sale, and recently I saw it for .83 on indie gala during the spring sale recently and it also can drop down to other prices too like 2.50 so be sure to pick up this game when it's on sale.","May 29, 2015","true","19.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Choose a hero, hack through waves and waves of enemies, buy upgrades, kill even more enemies, get more upgrades, kill a boss, get to the next level, start the whole process over. However dull that may sound, player will often suffer from the "one more" syndrome - "I will wipe one more floor and I will go to bed", "I'll clear one more level and I'm going to do something else" - which prolongs the time one spends playing it.\n\nHammerwatch has a very pleasant art style. The graphics is pixelated (in a good manner) and generally looks quite pretty and also fits the dungeon crawler theme. The only problem would be some single coins being too small to notice when lying directly behind a wall.\n\nThe game seems to have lots of content - enemies, levels, secret areas, traps, puzzles, bosses, upgrades. But the gameplay itself is a little too shallow, so playing for more than 2 hours feels like a chore (and makes your fingers hurt for bashing the skill buttons). There is a level editor and Steam Workshop integration, so probably there are more fun scenarios to play rather than the original ones. There's also a multiplayer mode, which I had no chance to test and I deeply regret it because it looks like the game's value shines much brighter with it.\n\nThe game could use some improvements with loot system being the most important one in my opinion. Currently, there are only 4 things that can be picked up: gold, hp/mana pots, vendor coins and extra lives. Implementing some more interesting loot system could really improve the overall value of the game and increase the feeling of playing a good roguelike (luck based drops that sometimes set you up for a level and sometimes require specific play style to benefit). Lack of randomly generated worlds is also a little bit bummer, as it decreases replayability value a lot, however, it is understandable that some of the current elements (puzzles, secret areas) would just not work with generated floors so devs had to make a decision there.\n\nAs I said in the beginning, Hammerwatch is not a great game. However, it is often to be found at 90% discount (1€~), which is a crazy good price for a solid game like this one. I bought it on one of such occassions and I don't regret it. Paying the full price might be a bit to steep, though. All in all, I had some fun playing it and I will have some more, because I am not finished yet.\n","January 2, 2015","true","8.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's worse than some of the flash games I've played of the same type.\n\nFirstly, multiplayer is a travesty. They could have used Steamplay and made it super simple but no, you need to port forward to get hosting to work properly. It's not that hard but, an extra step that never needed to happen.\n\nAlso, you share lives. My bud & I went through, he died a bit due to being the melee tank Paladin while I was the ranger and when I eventually died, the game was basically over because we had no lives left.\n\nSecondly, the level design is utter rubbish. I'm adjusted to play Rogue-likes however having to walk very, very slowly back to where you were after dying is just poor design. They do give you checkpoints but they are so far spaced/poorly placed you may as well not bother.\n\nThird, while I did not get too deeply into the game, you start each class with next to nothing. A basic attack with a horrid default layout (Up to attack, really?) and 1 spell (Bound to Left, on the arrow keys, okay dev, okay.) It wasn't until far later that we found a shop to buy something new, which wasn't even something really good mind you. It was a combo skill type of deal, requiring you to kill 10 enemies in a very, very short time frame (Which in multiplayer, good luck as the counter only increases with YOUR killing blows) and you'll receive a minor movement speed buff. Wow, neat-o.\n\nFourth, the random death drops. Now, I'm okay with crates and barrels occasionally being booby trapped. In Diablo & Path of Exile, it's a minor inconvenience at best, especially when you start getting a lot of health/resistances. In this game, however, your character is made of wet paper and when you break a crate open to a black bomb (Which, mind you, blends into the environment seamlessly) and it blows up .3 seconds later, taking over half your health on the squishier classes, it's annoying as hell.\n\nThis got lengthy real quick and I doubt anybody will actually read this but, hey, there you go. I do NOT recommend buying this game. I'm not whining about the difficulty, I love hard games with learning curves, etc but this game has none as you'll just get bored after your first game over.\n\nI just now decided to try the game again/collect the trading cards (Which is why I now have 2 hours of this *shudders*) to at least get some minor return on the cost of this steaming pile, it's still utter crap.","November 28, 2013","false","1.5"," 37 of 71 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","37","71","0","4"

I played through the whole game with friends, and that didn't enhance the fun one bit. A few minutes into the game I realized the soundtrack (at least in the first area) is just some generic and uninteresting chiptune music played on loop that added nothing to the mood of the game, so I muted it. So then I went on my adventure where I spammed the A button on my controller, occasionally the B button, sometimes the X button, and sometimes Y I guess while facing or being in near-proximity to very boring monster types. I'd also like to mention I played through this game while high, you'd think that would make it more enjoyable but no, it doesn't.\n\nOh, and if youre expecting a challenge: don't. This game was stupid easy, at least on the normal difficulty. I can assume that the higher difficulties are nothing intuitive and are just enemies with more health/damage/speed or whatever, basically making the grind to finish this piece of ♥♥♥♥ game significantly longer and more frustrating than difficult. You are hardly punished for dying. You go back to a checkpoint and lose a life, wow, sounds punishing and roguelike right? Yea. Maybe if you couldnt buy lives, they're really cheap too. On the final boss I literally just bought us around 30 lives giving us around 45 and I just ran at the boss and spammed my lame wizard ♥♥♥♥ at some dragon balls or whatever, died, respawned, and did the exact same thing until the boss died, and I was doing most of the damage.\n\nExpect to run around boring environments trying to find boring keys while fighting boring enemies all while literally destroying every wooden box and barrel around you for money that you use to buy boring upgrades, ultimately leading you to an underwhelming duke out with some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dragon that can easily be beaten by taking advantage of this games poor mechanics. This game literally has nothing interesting about it other than a level editor.\n\nIf you feel like sitting on your ♥♥♥ mashing A while listening to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ chiptune music, then whatever that's your thing. If your someone who expects to get your moneys worth of something, or someone who likes video games that aren't ♥♥♥♥, than this game is not for you. ♥♥♥♥ this piece of ♥♥♥♥.","January 18, 2014","false","5.1"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","3"

Old school dungeon crawler experience. Highly receommend you play with friends though to really get the full experience. This game took me and my friends about 6-8 hours in one straight run through, and that's without finding all the secrets and suprises this game has to offer. A controller isn't needed but it can make strfing a lot easier if you aren't used to a keyboard (I used the keyboard, a mouse isn't needed for gameplay). If you want to play with friends, Hamachi is easiest way to connect with each other.

There is just so much to say about Hammerwatch. It is everything I have ever wanted from a dungeon crawler and more. The game is very reminiscent of classic dungeon crawlers such as Gauntlet. First, i'll talk about the combat. The enemy variety isn't that great. The further you get, you get different enemies, but for the most part, you'll be fighting the same old things. Despite this, the game does get very hard. The controls are very responsive, later in the game it is extremely skill based and the enemies become stupidly hard. Now onto the characters. Hammerwatch has four different characters, The Paladin, The mage, The archer and The warlock. These four different characters moves change to suit any persons playstyle. The only problem there being that The warlock is ever so slightly overpowered despite how you play. The maps are very well put together and offer a decent ammount of variety, although, they suffer the same way the enemies do. The tiles and textures/sprites used in the floors don't differ much until later on in the game. So, to sum this all up, Hammerwatch is a very tight, fun and hard Action/RPG/Dungeon crawler. It has some problems, but the game is fantastic and will be a masterpiece to fans of classic dungeon crawlers.","April 10, 2014","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Local Co-Op works very well, the classes are pretty diverse and good teamwork is needed, especially during the boss battles.

From the second I watched the impressive trailer I knew how fun this game looked, and I wasn't disappointed. Spent a number of late nights running through this challenging but thrilling indie wonder, still one of my top indie games of this last year.\nEdit: Months and months later, I am still playing Hammerwatch. This is a truly amazing game with a devoted indie team that is continually supporting us with new content for free. The new campaign was amazing. Seriously, they could have called it a whole new game and charged more money for it, and I would have been happy. Grab a copy, or much better yet, get a four pack and play with some buddies. I have gotten so much entertainment from this game for the small price I paid. There are few other games on Steam I could reccomend more for co-op fun.","November 27, 2013","true","111.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's incredibly nostalgic and reminds of an old school Gauntlet-style arcade adventure. The graphics style looks dated for effect, but suits the game incredibly well. There's a little bit of snark in the dialogue throughout the game too, which actually helps with the immersion.\n\nGameplay is straightforward, but surprisingly complex. You can never fully level your characters, so you have to pick and choose your abilities. This makes for a unique playthrough each time, and with the addition of more characters now, you can see the game many different ways.\n\nWith lots of hidden passages, and the ability for up to 4-people play, this game is a hidden gem on Steam.","December 24, 2014","true","26.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

First of all, i think that the allows for a wide and varying way to play the game. While you always play the same levels each playthrough, you get a completely different experience with strategy and pacing depending on both difficulty and character class that you choose. Becuase of this, playing the same levels is not much of a problem. Single player is a very enjoyable experience, with the game being balanced for any character to compete the game on their own, at least with enough skill. Multiplayer is also a lot of fun, changing the gameplay by a lot, increasing the ways you can enjoy the game even more. With the hours I've spent playing the game, i do think it is worth buying.","June 22, 2014","true","84.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was an impulse purchase, spurred on by the ability to set the game to look like it’s being played on an old CRT screen, complete with phosphor scanlines and curved edges. I’m a sucker for that stuff. The little-hero pixel artstyle is also charming enough, but trudging through the pre-built campaign just didn’t gel with me. It took too long to kill the huge hordes of monsters, to find the keys needed to open doors.\n\nThen I tried it multiplayer, and everything fell into place. This is Gauntlet, for a new generation. Working together, covering each other’s backs, or accidentally killing your partners by triggering traps - it’s a blast. Hammerwatch is an incredibly reserved game design. There are four classes, each unique and upgradeable with new attacks you buy from vendors across the maps, but nothing carries over into a new game. It’s a bit one-shot, and might change as the game evolves since it’s still in a bit of a “beta” state.\n\nMultiplayer works local, LAN and online, and loading a savegame for an online campaign in progress requires a bit of finagling. but it does work. Likely too simplistic for most, Hammerwatch is an acquired taste. But with the right friends, it’s a kind of magic straight out of 1985.","September 22, 2014","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Combined with an old style of play that will make fans of classic Gauntlet smile, but with enough new features to give it a fun and more modern set of gameplay mechanics.  Add some challenging bosses that can be beat by fighting intellgently and learning their patterns with a little bit of finesse to dodge, challenging at times, but not difficult enough as to be completely frustrating.  Also any time co-op is in a game only makes it more fun, check it out if you're a fan of some old school fun.","December 4, 2013","true","24.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is just so much to say about Hammerwatch. It is everything I have ever wanted from a dungeon crawler and more. The game is very reminiscent of classic dungeon crawlers such as Gauntlet. First, i'll talk about the combat. The enemy variety isn't that great. The further you get, you get different enemies, but for the most part, you'll be fighting the same old things. Despite this, the game does get very hard. The controls are very responsive, later in the game it is extremely skill based and the enemies become stupidly hard. Now onto the characters. Hammerwatch has four different characters, The Paladin, The mage, The archer and The warlock. These four different characters moves change to suit any persons playstyle. The only problem there being that The warlock is ever so slightly overpowered despite how you play. The maps are very well put together and offer a decent ammount of variety, although, they suffer the same way the enemies do. The tiles and textures/sprites used in the floors don't differ much until later on in the game. So, to sum this all up, Hammerwatch is a very tight, fun and hard Action/RPG/Dungeon crawler. It has some problems, but the game is fantastic and will be a masterpiece to fans of classic dungeon crawlers.","April 10, 2014","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would not recommend playing it with random people on the intenet, but with three friends this little game really shines at its best. I can't really imagine it being fun played alone though.\n\nThe combat seems a bit repetetive and simple at first, but the game is really difficult, because of the sheer amount of enemies and everything feels very precise. I never felt bored when slashing through the absurd amount of enemies on the screen. There are some random elements, like randoms crits and stuns, but everything feels really skillbased. Everytime you die you know that it has been your own fault, there are hardly any cheap deaths (outside of the boss fights...).\n\nThere are some minor flaws in the game though:\nOne being that you have to do portfowarding, which isn't a problem for exerienced players, but may be a problem for some people. Also I could not get a local game to work, but I did not really bother me.\nAlso I didn't enjoy the boss fights all that much, but maybe thats just me, since my friends seem to have enjoyed it. I found them quite cheap honestly.\n\nBut overall this is a great game with a nice difficulty curve, challenging but not frustrating and it really encourages teamwork.","December 1, 2013","true","13.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is very skill-based and reminds me of old school classics like Alien Breed or The Chaos Engine, yet it gives gamers the possibility to tweak its difficulty, which effectively lowers the entry level to a point suitable for almost everyone. The graphics are really nice (if you like this stylization) and the OST is really great. The downsides? I’m really missing gaining XP for killing mobs here. This and learning extra skills. The two basic ones you get at the beginning become quite boring after a few hours and new ones come late into the game.

You then have standard gameplay modes wiht different dificulty. whch offer you the vanilla gameplay experience.

You run through multiple dungeons and kill various monsters. You collect gold with which you can buy potions, life, combo moves etc. There are four classes which are quite different to play.

I have trouble trying to come up with any reason not to get Hammerwatch. It has everything I look for in a game: great level design, fun yet responsive controls, a decent amount of difficulty, pretty visuals, a non-distracting, more inferred than told story and the best coop I've seen in a while. Each of the four classes is fun to play, I found that neither is more suited than the others in every situation, each having its own set of advantages and disadvantages depending on the situation at hand. It's very satisfying to master each class, that enough had me coming back even after beating the game once. The secrets hidden in the world of Hammerwatch are a big part of the game and I found that going after all of them adds a lot to the experience, which can be said about very few games. Playing the coop campaign in this game is the best part of it all. Having two or more players of complementing abilities adds a whole new level of combat strategy with the teamwork that arises. Hammerwatch is one of the rare games that come up once in a while and remind me why I love games.\n\nPros:\n+ fun in singleplayer\n+ better with friends\n+ the music, the visuals\n+ just about everything else\n\nCons:\n- might be fixed by now but my Creative sound card had a few issues with the game when I started, I got a bsod and the save got corrupted so I had so start over","January 19, 2014","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You then have standard gameplay modes wiht different dificulty. whch offer you the vanilla gameplay experience.

There are only a handful of characters when we played but they all have interesting powers that really ramp up as you level.  The levels are long and really challenging, so you'll want to play with as many friends as possible.  Sadly death comes easy, and you'll have to start at the beginning if everyone falls without making a save along the way.  What's interesting is that you can choose handicaps to make the game less challenging.  But then it feels like you're giving in to the difficulty. so you'll try to use as few as possible.\n\nThe level selection is rather limited as well, and you can't choose an individual level within a campaign, which we found very debilitating.  Hammerwatch does have a level editor and community content, though we've never found the urge to try them with the amount of professionally done content the game had to offer.

The graphics are charming, and dungeon crawling element is very entertaining. Although, the 8-direction movement can make combat difficult and choppy, but it is not very hard to work with. Another bothersome aspect is the saving feature. you find places where you can save, and it is also your new spawnpoint, and if your game ends in a game over you may return to your game through the ''load'' section, which is confusing. This section only displays the date you played the game on, so if you play more than one game, it becomes confusing. Also, games played through the ''load'' section can not be played with other people, whether or not the game began as multiplayer. The multiplayer function is easy, flowing and fun. The different hero choices are between 4 characters, each with there own attacks.\n\nOverall, the game is fun, and has potential for more maps and possibly characters. One major annoyance to me is that there isn't any type of gear whatsoever, which seems like a standard for rpg games.\n\nThis game is cute, fun, but seems to need improvement.

It was an impulse purchase, spurred on by the ability to set the game to look like it’s being played on an old CRT screen, complete with phosphor scanlines and curved edges. I’m a sucker for that stuff. The little-hero pixel artstyle is also charming enough, but trudging through the pre-built campaign just didn’t gel with me. It took too long to kill the huge hordes of monsters, to find the keys needed to open doors.\n\nThen I tried it multiplayer, and everything fell into place. This is Gauntlet, for a new generation. Working together, covering each other’s backs, or accidentally killing your partners by triggering traps - it’s a blast. Hammerwatch is an incredibly reserved game design. There are four classes, each unique and upgradeable with new attacks you buy from vendors across the maps, but nothing carries over into a new game. It’s a bit one-shot, and might change as the game evolves since it’s still in a bit of a “beta” state.\n\nMultiplayer works local, LAN and online, and loading a savegame for an online campaign in progress requires a bit of finagling. but it does work. Likely too simplistic for most, Hammerwatch is an acquired taste. But with the right friends, it’s a kind of magic straight out of 1985.","September 22, 2014","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not a whole lot to say as it's a very simply designed game, but it was much better than expected.","August 29, 2013","true","24.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a truly amazing game with a devoted indie team that is continually supporting us with new content for free. The new campaign was amazing. Seriously, they could have called it a whole new game and charged more money for it, and I would have been happy. Grab a copy, or much better yet, get a four pack and play with some buddies.

I would not recommend playing it with random people on the intenet, but with three friends this little game really shines at its best. I can't really imagine it being fun played alone though.\n\nThe combat seems a bit repetetive and simple at first, but the game is really difficult, because of the sheer amount of enemies and everything feels very precise. I never felt bored when slashing through the absurd amount of enemies on the screen. There are some random elements, like randoms crits and stuns, but everything feels really skillbased. Everytime you die you know that it has been your own fault, there are hardly any cheap deaths (outside of the boss fights...).\n\nThere are some minor flaws in the game though:\nOne being that you have to do portfowarding, which isn't a problem for exerienced players, but may be a problem for some people. Also I could not get a local game to work, but I did not really bother me.\nAlso I didn't enjoy the boss fights all that much, but maybe thats just me, since my friends seem to have enjoyed it. I found them quite cheap honestly.\n\nBut overall this is a great game with a nice difficulty curve, challenging but not frustrating and it really encourages teamwork.","December 1, 2013","true","13.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can't imagine it'd be particularly compelling solo, but the co-op is fantastic and the classes really are unique and mesh well together (<3 forever my Priest buddy).\n\nWorkshop integration is a great touch, and the included expansion seems huge!

Remember how awesome games like Gauntlet Legends were? This game takes that concept and executes it in some sweet ♥♥♥ ways. Skillful dodging and timing your attacks is much more prominent. You choose what to level up OR NOT if you want to conserve your money and have more later for more options. Use positioning and abilities to get the best out of the health you have remaining.\n\nI've been fortunate enough to experience this quite a bit with some friends. This is not an easy game. You can't just mosey on into a room willy-nilly. You will get smacked down by a horde of beetles or magic weilding mages. Bait a few enemies out at a time OR if you think you can dodge,  GO IN SWINGIN'!\n\nYou have the option to choose from some very different classes. One of the problems with games like this is the melee classes all feel the same. Maybe all of the classes feel generic as if it doesn't really matter what class you chose. It's all about mashing buttons. That's not the case with Hammerwatch. You will play each class differently I guarantee it. Not only because it makes them more efficient, but because you will die if you don't.\n\nJust be careful. I've given myself quite a few blisters playing this damn-good game too much at one time. I suggest a controller, however you can manage without.\n\nOh and be sure to keep an eye out for secrets. There's more than you can shake a stick at!

All of that is easier said than done, as you've got hoardes of fun-to-kill creatures intent on feasting on your intrails, various traps, and challenging boss encounters between you and success.\n\nControls 8/10\nControls can be abit sluggish occassionally, but definitely nothing to toss your keyboard through the window over.\nMovement is with the WASD keys, and your various attacks are with the arrow keys. This game has controller support though I have never used it, I have heard some say the controller support is poorly implemented, but the keyboard controls just work, and they feel right after your first few OOOOH dude moments. Holding Space bar "locks" you into whatever direction you are facing while you move around, and holding Left Shift makes you stand in place so you can face any direction you want without moving. F key drinks whatever potion you may have from Rejuvination to temporary Invulnerability.\n\nSound 9/10\nThe music is what happens when 8 bit whackiness meets intense symphonic orchestration. It will be in your head, and matches the frantic pace of the gameplay perfectly.\n\nGameplay 8/10\nThis game is Amazing! You can set various 'challenges' before you begin a map, such as starting with 1 HP, or sharing HP, or set some 'crutches' or handicaps like unlimited lives and health regeneration so you can really tailor the already great experience to your own twisted needs. There are a a number of classes to choose from like the Paladin who is a defensive animal, hiding behind his shield blocking most projectile attacks while slashing away valiantly when monsters get foolish enough to get close to him, the ranger who can shoot from a good safe distance, the priest who can heal or deal damage with a beam of energy and drop some neato energy draining fields that will heal people who stand in it if monsters are getting damaged in it. Warlocks who can poison creatures with their dagger and toss some cool lightning around.. And mage, with his AoE short range fireballs, and ability to call in a meteor shower to rain in some arcane devastation. And each class really brings a different feel to the game. Everything is in a nice top down view which really helps in this type of game.\n\nOverall I'd give this game 8½ / 10, and totally reccomend it.","January 14, 2015","true","62.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Noob (Nightmare Lyra)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightmarelyre/","406 products in account","Brilliantly done retro Action RPG that is a lot of fun to play with friends. The goal of the game is to get through a number of sprawling dungeons, filled with enemies, loot, obscure secrets and boss fights, with a big emphasis on combat and looting.\n\nThe gameplay reminds me a lot of Zelda: A Link To The Past in the way you control your character, though instead of fighting one and one enemy, here it is all about fighting stupidly huge hordes of enemies and getting the highest kill combos possible to activate special abilities, while also dodging a large ammount of projectiles, which lend itself really well to this type of gameplay due to it's smooth controlls. However, you do want to play it with friends, as there appears to be little to no difficulty scaling according to the ammount of players, and you are gonna die a lot if you don't have some friends with you to help.\n\nSomething also worth noting is that despite it's retro look and game style, it avoids going into Rougelike territory and instead opts with premade maps and a extra lives system, which I like myself as I prefer a well designed static map and more tries per game, though if you want your experience to be randomized you might have to look elsewhere for that. However, the game comes bundled with a map editor so you can make your own dungeons to spice things up after beating the official campaign.\n\nIt's a bit repetitive, but as a pure multiplayer game it's entertaining, challenging without being unfair most of the time and sports a great retro look and feel without having that limit the quality of the gameplay itself. Worth checking out for sure along with some friends.","June 21, 2014","true","19.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Be warned, though, that it can be terribly difficult (especially The Temple of the Sun campaign on hard difficulty). The difficulty is probably what turns most people off, and it may prevent them from seeing everything Hammerwatch has to offer later in the game. For its pricetag, the campaigns are fairly long. The art is great, and the soundtrack (by Two Feathers) is even better. It provided the perfect amount of nostalgia, and feels most like the early Gauntlet games.\n\nMy only complaint is that to "level up," you have to collect gold and spend it on upgrades at vendors, rather than by killing enemies.\n\nKeep in mind that I played the game by myself for both campaigns.

Reminiscent of old classics such as Gauntlet, players are thrown into the bowels of Castle Hammerwatch as one of six playable classes, and must proceed through four Acts of increasing difficulty as they struggle to ascend to the top of the castle and find what treasure awaits them; fighting off seemingly endless enemies and four blood-thirsty bosses as they do.\n\nEach class in the game has its own unique traits and abilities along with upgrade paths available for purchase from hidden merchants throughout the various dungeons. Of these classes, the Thief is the one I frequent the most. With high mobility and a wide attack range from his dual wielded daggers, the thief is all about getting in and out dangerous situations while cutting down swathes of enemies with his blisteringly high attack speed. As for skills, the Thief starts out with Fan of Knives, which upon activation throws multiple knives in an arc in front of him, damaging and piercing through multiple enemies. His two other unlockable skills are Grappling Hook and Smoke Bombs, the first of which can be used to hook any nearby wall and then quickly pull you towards it, stunning foes in the process; while the latter acts as a large area of effect (AoE) stun. A unique feature that only applies to the Thief however is that while all his skills cost significantly less mana than the other classes, they also have a secondary cost of gold, which partially balanced by his passive ability to steal gold off the corpses of slain enemies. In addition to the Thief, the other five playable classes available at this moment are the Paladin, squaring off behind his towering shield, the Ranger, which focuses on ranged attacks with his bow and wave clearing bombs, the fireball casting Wizard, the treacherous Warlock, wielding a poisoned dagger and blood magic, and lastly the Priest, who you guessed it, has a knack for healing teammates.\n\nA feature that really adds to the depth and replayability of Hammerwatch is it’s accessibility to being modded. This means custom campaigns, custom game types, new enemies, and hell, I’ve even seen prototypes for brand new playable classes on the forums. When the game first came out, it was all about downloading custom files and then manually adding them to the correct file folder the game’s directory for the mod to be installed correctly, but recently this all changed when the game finally got full Steam Workshop support, nearly a year after its initial release. This gives a huge new audience access to the piles of custom campaigns already out there, as well as inspire new modders to create even more content for that larger audience. In addition to its accessibility to installing and using mods, Hammerwatch also comes packaged with its own custom Level Editor/Development Program. With this tool you can do anything from drag and drop existing resources onto your workspace and make your own custom dungeons to even going as far as scripting and uploading your own custom resources. While the level editor program has a ton to it and can be rather intimidating to get into and start working in it, there are multiple Youtube video tutorials on the subject which will walk you through at least the basics.\n\nAlthough at its core, Hammerwatch is a retro hack-n-slash dungeon crawler, the base difficulty and default settings give a very rouge-like feel to the game as well. The players have a set amount of lives shared among them and once you run out, your progress is lost; and on top of that, even on normal difficulty, the game can be incredibly dangerous and difficult, with most traps and some enemies being able to kill you in just a single hit. And even though I happen to find enjoyment in getting dismembered time after time and then drowning in my own pity and incompetence at the game, others who have issues with the initial difficulty of the game can give themselves handicaps such as having infinite lives in the game settings to get rid of these rouge-like elements.\n\nWith more than 25 hours logged in on it already and more to come once I gather my old group together to tackle some of the new Workshop content, I can say it’s been more than worth the low price point, and even more so if bought on Steam Sale. So if you’re into any game with high difficulty, looking for a game with some great nostalgic vibes, or just an enjoyable easy to get into Co-op game to play with some friends on your day off, then I highly recommend looking at Hammerwatch.","September 6, 2014","true","40.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is highly recommended to play this game in multiplayer (class synergies will make exploring that much easier), though you can play singleplayer with little issue (depending on what class you select for yourself).\n\nHighly recommended, especially those nostalgic for this style of game.","July 27, 2014","true","21.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Be warned, though, that it can be terribly difficult (especially The Temple of the Sun campaign on hard difficulty). The difficulty is probably what turns most people off, and it may prevent them from seeing everything Hammerwatch has to offer later in the game. For its pricetag, the campaigns are fairly long. The art is great, and the soundtrack (by Two Feathers) is even better. It provided the perfect amount of nostalgia, and feels most like the early Gauntlet games.\n\nMy only complaint is that to "level up," you have to collect gold and spend it on upgrades at vendors, rather than by killing enemies.\n\nKeep in mind that I played the game by myself for both campaigns. I imagine that playing with friends online or locally would be even more fun.","January 3, 2015","true","87.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fliggys/recommended/239070/","fliggys","Fliggyz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fliggys/","151 products in account","The story of Hammerwatch truly is a modern masterpiece in storytelling. As the campaign begins, the line "The small bridge broke behind you...there is probably no way out!" is displayed.\n\nAnd that's it. That's the plot.\n\nHammerwatch isn't the type of game that really needs a plot, however. The fact that the bridge broke and there is probably no way out is actually a decent introduction to the game as a whole: a light-hearted, if not a bit shallow, romp. In addition to the campaign, there is also a wave-based defense mode and the inclusion of a level editor for creating custom levels.\n\nDoing its best to harken back to classic Gauntlet, Hammerwatch is a cooperative hack-and-slash action game. There are four classes to choose from: Paladin, Warlock, Ranger, and Wizard. Each class starts with a regular attack as well as a special attack that drains a certain amount of magic points. More special attacks are eventually unlocked, though it takes a bit too long to actually earn them. In my experience, nothing comes close to the effectiveness of a Ranger since their default attack pierces through enemies -- continuing its trajectory to harm even more enemies -- and their bomb special attack is perfect for kiting and killing large groups of enemies at a time.\n\nIt's also possible to strafe while moving, which is perhaps the most important thing to take away from this review if you buy Hammerwatch, as it’s not immediately apparent within the game. Mastering the strafe-and-attack is crucial for any class' survivability, since moving diagonally while attacking is so freaking useful.\n\nThere are a handful of secrets, puzzles, and obstacles that don't necessarily require fighting at all. Hidden rooms permeate each floor, and if the player keeps an eye out they should be able to find just about all of them. Puzzles are never too difficult, and in fact sometimes they are insultingly easy. These variants do a good job of breaking up the monotonous wave-clearing gameplay that makes up most of Hammerwatch.\n\nPlaying alone feels hollow, since a large part of the difficulty comes in the form of more and more of the same types of enemies being thrown at the player -- a challenge that's far easier to enjoy when in the company of friends. Single-player reveals the game's shallow mechanics; movement and two attacks don't really make for the most compelling gameplay.\n\nProgression comes from a variety of vendors throughout the levels. Early on it is a very linear progression since only certain vendors are available. The first upgrade is the ability to combo, which allows players who kill at least 10 enemies in a row very quickly to gain a temporary boost to their stats. Later upgrades will build off of this, making it easier to combo and giving better benefits for comboing. By the end of the second act, players will finally have access to more special moves as well as having a little more open-endedness to their character's build.\n\nThe problem is that the end of the second act is a decent chunk of game away -- especially for players going it alone. While the level design is very open-ended and non-linear, the character progression is the exact opposite and takes way too long to become interesting. It can feel like forever when slogging through the seemingly endless waves of enemies with the basic attacks, waiting for something cool or interesting to happen.\n\nAt the gnarled and gore-encrusted heart of Hammerwatch is a combo system of pleasing simplicity. To trigger it, you must kill a bunch of enemies very quickly, and then once it's in motion, you can upgrade it in a number of straightforward ways - to deal 360-degree damage, say, or to heal. You can build it, too, by killing more enemies. It's action game design at its most basic, and it works.\n\nIn order to feed the combos, Hammerwatch needs to ensure that you have plenty of enemies to massacre at all times - and this is a favour it's very happy to grant. Grubs, skeletons, wandering eyeballs: these standard fantasy baddies wait for you in packs around every corner, spawning from pits or rotten tree trunks or mysterious fountains. Along with a standard attack, each character has a special that can generally be counted on to do a lot of damage at once, and so, as you move from combo to combo, a pleasant rhythm settles in. Throw yourself into the fray to power yourself up. Get into trouble so you can get out of trouble again.\n\n1\nThe early levels drag on for a bit too long, and enemy variety is weak throughout. The thrill comes from the sheer numbers.\nAround this central relationship is a game of equal simplicity, a straight-up dungeon-crawl in the spirit of Gauntlet. There's a handful of familiar character classes (the paladin's a melee tank with a deadly dash, for example, while the wizard's low on health but just look at the flames he can conjure); there's the lightest trace of a backstory (the bridge has collapsed behind you, so why not keep going, eh?); and the bulk of the game consists of working your way up through a series of stacked dungeons, eviscerating baddies, standing on rune-splattered pressure plates to unlock secret areas or open the path to the boss, grabbing all the gold you can find, and then using your spoils to make you incrementally better at eviscerating baddies.\n\nLike Gauntlet, the whole thing's designed around multiplayer, of course, and you should know in advance that if you're soloing Hammerwatch, it's a bit of a slog. Levels are longer than you might expect and the odds are stacked heavily against you from the off. The perks you buy at vendors scattered about the maps take a little too long to get entertaining, and the bosses present roadblocks that will eat through your remaining lives with astonishing speed. On top of that, Hammerwatch goes against the current trend of procedural generation, so you're going to trudge across identical early levels over and over as you get better.\n\n2\nBonus levels make the homage even clearer. Gauntlet forever!\nWith friends, of course, none of this matters: you bundle around the corridors and arenas in a bait-ball of chaos, letting rip with melee, ranged and specials at anything that presents itself. You'll stop only to glug a potion or to check the map, and in the midst of the carnage, you'll start to realise that Hammerwatch's simple pieces are surprisingly effective at generating moments of proper panic.\n\nThis is the kiting-est game ever made, for example. Most enemy behaviour is tailored to give chase, so foes quickly form huge pursuing crowds - and this might explain why the best levels on offer turn out to be mazes. Dead ends and blind corners present glorious risks when you can't shoot backwards over your shoulder, and they tend to bring out the best in you as a result - they transform you into the frantic, cornered hero, determined to blast a way out of trouble no matter what. At times, Hammerwatch almost feels like a racing game (at least it does if you're using a pad rather than the surprisingly wretched keyboard controls) as you steer through wandering fiends at speed, gathering a pack of nasties in your wake.\n\nBeyond all that? There are wave-based and survival modes and a rather daunting editor, and there's the delightfully grubby pixel art to take in throughout, which offers just the same kind of mead-splattered ambience as the game that so obviously inspired it. There's precious little depth lurking in Hammerwatch, then, but if you've got a few friends handy or are willing to wait around online for the worryingly small community to make itself known, this is genuine old-fashioned skeleton-bashing with a gloriously tidal approach to chucking in the enemies.\n\n7 / 10","January 1","true","3.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","0"

There are strafe and stand modifier buttons that allow you to lock the direction of either movement or aiming while held down, and that is the only way to do one without doing the other.\n\nFurthermore, controllers are more capable than the keyboard setup because the game allows you to disable 8-way aiming on the thumbstick; and since there is no mouse aiming, this is impossible on a keyboard because you are only allowed 8 directions over 4 keys. Same goes for movement, though every game is like that.\n\nI'm sure people are thinking, "Dude, you're just not good enough." Well, I seem to be surviving just fine, so that's not it. "It was intentionally designed like that as a throwback to games like Gauntlet." The games it's throwing back to were from a period where design philosophy wasn't as refined as it is now. It's especially hard to understand such design choices since these problems have been solved for quite some time.\n\nI'm going to continue trying to beat the campaign with my friend just so we can feel like we got our money's worth.

Lots of secret areas, multiplayer is fun, and overall good game.\n\nMy only gripes are that you can't use the mouse to aim or anything, they could have done better with that and that you either need to use Hamachi or Port Forwarding in order to get multiplayer working (as a host).","March 1, 2014","true","17.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The only problem I have is the faulty net code(somewhat laggy but not bad[Example, sometimes the monsters or even your team mates "teleport" around but it's so rare that I wouldn't even worry about it.]) and that every time you start a multiplayer from a load save, anyone but the host has to repick their characters and hope you are near the merchants or else you start with the starting stats but you have all the gold you spent. My suggestion for a patch or even if they make a Hammerwatch 2 is that they make it so that you must join a lobby every time even if you do it from a load and have the save file on everyone's computer that has "their character" data.\n\nRegardless, it's still a good game and using the local co-op has been what I've been using a lot with my brother and friends.

What more would you want? maybe a few post processing options to make the game appear as if it is being played on an old CRT monitor? the nerd in me exploded at the sight.\n\nIt features a campaign that is designed to last around two to three hours, but could be done quicker with serious practice. There is also a lot of strategy when it comes to which class you have picked specifically, such as when you are a priest in co-op ideally you should stick to your teammates; without them your combat skills are very limited. So you tailor your upgrades to support (levelling up healing, increasing movement etc.) and this really helps the characters actually progress. But as these reset every time you start a new game it still keeps the game fresh and allows new strategies to be tested out. I love playing Hammerwatch and recommend it to anyone who wants to have some fun with friends also.\n\n5 Stars!

Even though I had very much completed the game with about 700 hours of game time in, I still wasn’t satisfied. I’d played Dark Souls 2 for a while, but it just wasn’t the same as the first game. I know I picked up Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate and while I’m still playing the game, it doesn’t quite fit the niche of what I was hoping for. I wanted a game which was as unforgiving and just as rewarding as Dark Souls with the same kind of co-op that would make me appreciate the power of friendship. Since there aren’t too many games that copy that feel, I find myself diverging into the Roguelike genre. Just so it happens, the game Hammerwatch seemed to sell me right away.\n\nNow, I don’t usually delve into Roguelikes as they’re known for being intentionally and notoriously unfair and difficult. They’re something I often play to challenge myself but they’re not something I would ever see as a party game. When I bought the game on sale for 8 dollars(including three other copies), I’d initially hoped to find three other friends to traverse the dungeons of the evil castle to fight with. Unfortunately, first impressions really let me down and I had to give away a few of my copies out of pure disappointment. Then, I had one person come up to me and offered to do some co-op to which I gave the one more chance to tickle me…and I’ll be damned if that’s not what happened.\n\nHammerwatch is a Dungeon Crawler Roguelike in which you are a member of 6 dungeoneers who have made their way into the titular castle. Though some adventuring is implied to have occurred, you have been cut off by the rest of your party and you are forced to find your own way out of the castle to meet up with the rest of the party. Your chances appear to be slim, however, as they deduce you are unlikely to get out alive. With what weapons and skills you have, though, you hack and slash your way through hordes of various creatures.\n\nMy initial run through the game was me starting as a Thief on standard difficulty and my first time going through the game could be described as very much challenging going alone. Enemies often come in mobs large enough that you can find yourself easily surrounded and have the psychic kind of AI where they can detect you from a fair distance, even if you were behind a wall. The experience ended abruptly when I discovered that you have that archaic lives system and dying results in permadeath. Upon this discovery, I learned of quite a few other features through research that deterred my desire to play anymore. It wasn’t until my co-op experience that I entered the game a little too harshly.\n\nWhen you start the game, you have a choice between six characters(two of which were added in later patching), two campaigns, a difficulty setting, and a series of modifiers that make the game customizable to the player’s comforts, making the game experience as hardcore or casual as you’d like. Gameplay is simplified with one button for attacking and three skills to use. Unlike most RPGs, you do not level up by killing mobs. You actually go to merchants scattered throughout the campaign who you use gold to buy upgrades for your character. In most multiplayer experiences, collecting gold and treasure gets antagonistic. Fortunately, however, any gold you do pick up is gathered as a whole by the party and, better yet, you spend it as though it were separate.\n\nIf I had any complaints about the game, however, it’s that the save feature can be unforgiving when playing with random players. If they’re especially uncoordinated and uncooperative like two players I’d played with, they basically wandered off and soloed areas, getting killed off and wasting respawns. It wasn’t until I didn’t respawn when I discovered that the other party members had burned out all our lives and had been spending the time upgrading themselves and saving the game before they quit. If you’re playing with friends, this proves detrimental since saving doesn’t reset your respawns or health. If you get game over and reload your save, you start off with the amount of health, mana, stats, players registered, and number of respawns you had from the last save, regardless of who saved the game last. If you’re going to be playing with friends, I’d recommend making the game private.\n\nAlso, while four players are needed to make a balanced party, the ranger and priest are especially unbalanced in that the former is overpowered for going solo and the priest is so completely worthless by himself—this is because the priest can’t heal himself when he starts out. The game was clearly made more for multiplayer in mind rather than single player which may make going through the game on your own a varying experience.\n\nOverall, a lot of flaws and issues aside, the game, while repetitive at best, is definitely worth playing with friends, but I’d hardly recommend playing with random strangers or even the single player if you’re the sort who wants a balanced experience going it alone. It’s definitely got a niched audience who is going to enjoy it, especially those who like Roguelikes. It's just a shame not many of my friends share that taste. Personally, I’m actually planning on starting over the solo mode with features to make it as dark souls-like as possible…but then again, I’m just one of those self-loathing masochists who can’t get enjoyment out of a game anymore if it doesn’t somehow stop to ♥♥♥♥ on my face once in a while.","September 29, 2015","true","9.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you liked gauntlet but wished that it had been more of a real ARPG then you'll like this game. You don't really "level up" but there are "merchants" where you can increase your damage/health/etc using the gold that you find all over the place. There are still significant action type elements to it like dodging traps. While you have limited lives, you can reload saved games. The only thing I wish were added to this is procedurally generated levels, because it looks like the levels are the same every time. So it doesn't have the same replayability as a real "roguelike", but aside from that it's pretty close to a roguelike game. Very worthwhile if you can get it on sale for less than $5.","December 27, 2013","true","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That said, I am not especially satisfied with it, and after playing a few hours last night and completing about half of it, I do not intend to play it again.  I guess rather than "good" or "bad", I would use the word "standard" to describe this game.  It is just a remarkably ordinary, run-of-the-mill game to me.  It seems well polished, has fairly pleasant music, but nothing really sets it apart or makes it special.\n\nI killed hundreds upon hundreds of identical enemies in rooms that all kind of felt the same.  The game warns you in the beginning that it's especially difficult, but it took around an hour, maybe more, before I even took a single hit (normal difficulty).  The two bosses I encountered were "difficult", in the sense that they did hit me a fair bit, but there were so many extra lives being thrown at me that they were never actually a threat.  I'd enter the boss fight with ten lives, lose two or three of them to the boss, and then gain five as a reward.\n\nThe game seemed alright when I started, but after a while I found myself just waiting for it to be over.  I just spent way too much time essentially repeating the same fight over and over.  Stand still and shoot into a crowd of 100 skeletons until they're gone.  Move to the next room.  Repeat.\n\nI'd give this game like a 6/10 rating.  Not what I consider a bad game, as it seems to be polished and do what the devs wanted it to.  But not an especially good game either, as what it does is pretty unremarkable.","August 30, 2015","true","4.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lyrit/recommended/239070/","Lyrit","Lyrit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lyrit/","167 products in account","I'm going to summarize the two main disadvantages to this game (note that these only apply to single player, and I have no knowledge of multiplayer at all):\n1. The map is terrible.\nIn this game, each dungeon can last literally hours. That may not be too terrible in itself, except it takes even longer because the map screen does not allow you to see the whole dungeon that you've explored at once. The map only shows the areas nearby which you have already seen, and thus is severely limited in its usefulness. This can make exploring the full dungeon a nightmare. It can become a chore trying to find where to go next, sending you running in circles, simply because your map has practically no range beyond you.\n2. The saving system and game over system are completely horrendous pieces of garbage.\nYou can have several save files, only one per character you start. The game works like this: you have several lives for your character, and if you lose them all, you completely game over and have to revert to your last save or revert to the very beginning of the game. That is complete rubbish. The saving works in that you have one save per character, as said before. You can't revert to old saves of that character. Any time you step on a checkpoint or go to another floor, your game is automatically saved. This hurts you, as if you find you have only one life left and critical health, this game becomes a joke between running to enemies and back to a save point, hoping to God you don't get hit even once. In my personal experience, I went into the first dungeon's boss room during single player. As a reminder, whenever you travel to another floor of a dungeon, your game automatically saves. However, this time, without any warning, the door in which I entered became locked, meaning that I was literally save-locked into the boss room. In a GOOD game, if you found the boss to be too advanced for you, you'd be given the opportunity to backtrack and get more upgrades so that you stand a chance against the boss later. However, in THIS game, since I die in literally two hits to the boss and I can't do anything about it, I have to restart an entire 2+ hours of gameplay, making sure I clear out even more of the dungeon than I did the first time. I'm sorry, game developers, but would it really kill you to take it more like a Legend of Zelda game? In LoZ, if you game over, you get sent back to the beginning of the CURRENT dungeon and all of the enemies are respawned, but you don't lose any upgrades, items, or progress throughout the dungeon. This is still a punishment for losing, but it doesn't make you redo literally hours of gameplay. Even the original Legend of Zelda on the now-archaic NES had this methodology, as Nintendo knew their audience wouldn't want to restart every detail of a long and difficult dungeon. You crazy guys instead, for the far worse, force someone to restart literally the whole game over in the case where they get save-locked into a fight they can't win. This is the kind of design people joke about from the NES era, and it seems you did not pick that hint up. Game-overing someone to the title screen is a joke. Stop using it. It's an easy way to kill a game.\nOh yeah, and remember that I haven't even tried multiplayer yet, and I've heard some terrible things about multiplayer. Since I have no experience of it, though, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt (or at least exclude it from this review).\nIt's a huge disappointment, as this game actually would be tremendous amounts of fun otherwise. The characters are unique, the fighting style is linear and remarkable, and the dungeons can hold many great secrets. I swear that if you simply made a better map to allow someone to see more of the dungeon at once, a better save system to allow people to revert to older saves on a character, and a better game over system that doesn't literally force you to do the entire game over again, this could easily become several times more enjoyable and popular.\nThose things above shouldn't even take that much work to fix. If done with actual care, a developer wouldn't even have to edit any campaign levels.\nUntil the above are fixed for better enjoyability, I highly recommend that you, reader, STAY AWAY from this game. You'll find yourself addicted for a few good hours, then curse its name for such a crappy game over and save system. This game is not too old yet, so maybe the developers will take some heart and at least try to salvage it.\nIn short:\nThis game has tremendous potential, but it is horribly ruined by a bad saving and game over system, along with a map that doesn't help you get un-lost. Generally avoid unless you don't mind replaying literally hours over.","January 3, 2014","false","3.8"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","9","18","0","0"

If you liked gauntlet but wished that it had been more of a real ARPG then you'll like this game. You don't really "level up" but there are "merchants" where you can increase your damage/health/etc using the gold that you find all over the place. There are still significant action type elements to it like dodging traps. While you have limited lives, you can reload saved games. The only thing I wish were added to this is procedurally generated levels, because it looks like the levels are the same every time. So it doesn't have the same replayability as a real "roguelike", but aside from that it's pretty close to a roguelike game. Very worthwhile if you can get it on sale for less than $5.","December 27, 2013","true","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That said, I am not especially satisfied with it, and after playing a few hours last night and completing about half of it, I do not intend to play it again.  I guess rather than "good" or "bad", I would use the word "standard" to describe this game.  It is just a remarkably ordinary, run-of-the-mill game to me.  It seems well polished, has fairly pleasant music, but nothing really sets it apart or makes it special.\n\nI killed hundreds upon hundreds of identical enemies in rooms that all kind of felt the same.  The game warns you in the beginning that it's especially difficult, but it took around an hour, maybe more, before I even took a single hit (normal difficulty).  The two bosses I encountered were "difficult", in the sense that they did hit me a fair bit, but there were so many extra lives being thrown at me that they were never actually a threat.  I'd enter the boss fight with ten lives, lose two or three of them to the boss, and then gain five as a reward.\n\nThe game seemed alright when I started, but after a while I found myself just waiting for it to be over.  I just spent way too much time essentially repeating the same fight over and over.  Stand still and shoot into a crowd of 100 skeletons until they're gone.  Move to the next room.  Repeat.\n\nI'd give this game like a 6/10 rating.  Not what I consider a bad game, as it seems to be polished and do what the devs wanted it to.  But not an especially good game either, as what it does is pretty unremarkable.","August 30, 2015","true","4.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Maybe the game could use a bit more depth and be less repetitive/tedious at a time, but if you like the genre, you'll probably enjoy it. Grab a friend though, it improves the experience. I see a good potential in the moddability of this game. If you're highly critical of details or expect an RPG, you should probably avoid the game. At least i was happy finding that i can bind autoattacking on the same key as regular attacks. If devs could try and improve the few issues i've mentionned, it'd definitely make the game much more fun.

Occassionally you'll see old things mixed together in new ways - an enemy spawner next to a difficult stationary enemy, for example - but then that combination will get re-used dozens of times before you run into anything new, and that new thing may very well be a slightly faster version of an old enemy with different graphics. Tough enemies can take a minute to kill even if you're taking no damage and they pose no threat to you, making them more chore than threat, which only adds to the sense of tedium.\n\nThe difficulty is also extremely inconsistent.  Some enemies plink away with 1 damage and easily avoided attacks, while more difficult to avoid attacks often take half your life bar or more.  The game's first boss was vastly more difficult than the second.\n\nI would have been happy to play this same game with levels a tenth as long and a constant stream of new situations, instead of its current form, which feels like mostly padding.","November 30, 2014","false","5.2"," 25 of 50 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","25","50","0","1"

How original. I understand I'm in the minority if you look at the Steam ratings. I just don't agree with them.\n\nHammerwatch is a fairly basic, straightforward action RPG. It's a dungeon crawl that compensates for the few enemy types with an overabundance of them. It's the same game that I've played and seen dozens of times. There are no new mechanics to speak of here. It's spam the attack button and clear out enemies. Rinse and Repeat. Careful positioning of your character and taking care to min/max your build is what's needed.\n\nHere's the problem. That sounds like every other action RPG game in the last 20 years. In this case the devs decided that since they didn't have any graphical skills, they should just create ugly pixel blobs for everything and try to pass it off as "retro". I saw better looking games on my Atari 2600. I'm not kidding either. I'm all for a unique and interesting art style. It doesn't have to have modern graphics. But I find these muddled and frankly dull. With the same kind of gameplay I've experienced a dozen times before, I'm not finding any joy in Mudville.\n\nWhy would I want to play this over any dozens of other games that do the same thing, look better and play better? Maybe there's some cool novel mechanic or awesome story later on (though by all indications there isn't), but if there is I can't be bothered trying to find it given the derivative gameplay and horrendous graphics. I get the sense when I play this I should just go play a similar game that does it better and looks better.\n\nI hate to hammer on the graphics so much but when they're this off-putting, it's a massive issue. The meal may taste OK but if it looks like a plate of dog doo your dinner guests won't want to eat it. That's how Hammerwatch makes me feel. Then when I play it and get the feeling that I've done all this before there's no incentive to go on.\n\nAgain, I recognize that I'm in the minority here but I'm not giving bonus points for ugly, derivative games just because they're indie.","December 14, 2014","false","0.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

A simple dungeon crawler with effortless multiplayer and loot, lot's of loot. It's not the most difficult of games, but there's no real hand holding either. It delivered on my soft spot for games that throw ludicrous amounts of enemies your way and lets you wade through them like a hot knife through butter. There's also a healthy dose of secret areas, and shop-bought upgrades...\n\n"That's a pretty low score for such a gem", you might say... and if I stopped playing after the first two hours, I'd be inclined to agree with you...\n\nHowever the game reveals it's hand too soon. If you ignore the new skins, each level contains the same set of monsters, button pushing & key finding tasks and secrets. Once you see the formula you'll watch it repeated over and over. Plus if you start a new game with a different set of people you're destined to repeat even more. There's no randomisation of rooms or key locations, it's all 100% identical every time. Don't even get me started on the ending...\n\nIf this game is super cheap, and all your mates can get on it at the same time? You'll have a blast for a few hours... just don't take it too seriously after that... unless you're one game behind Reece on the leaderboards and need what you thought would be a quick win. 12.5 hours says I was looking in the wrong place [5.4]","October 18, 2014","false","12.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The problem here is that it's an updated version of the original Gauntlet with more RPG elements in it. And yes there is a secret level on Floor 2 that takes you right back to the first stage of Gauntlet as an homage to the original.\n\nProblem is, Gauntlet actually evolved itself as a game to include a character and progression saving system in Gauntlet Legends and that was an Arcade game, so what's this game's excuse?\n\nThis goes right back to basics... like clear a 100 floor dungeon in a single sitting, if you lose all of your lives or actually manage to get a real life then you have to start over from stratch again... No thanks, I'll pass and find something more productive to do like watch paint dry.\n\nAnother gripe of mine, that's been occuring all too frequently in indie games lately, is the old school I.P. connection system which is just unaccetable at this point in gaming...\n\nI mean really? I have to go open ports on my router because the developers decided to use an archaic connection design for their game... just ♥♥♥♥ off already with this nonsense.\n\nIt's more trouble than it's worth as you'll probably be the last man standing and want to fall asleep after 40 minutes of this tripe.\n\nWhen you're expecting to connect to your friends after first booting up the game and discovering you have to go play with ports... it's a bit disheartening. Honestly if I didn't already have Hamachi installed I would have just closed it and watched a movie instead... or maybe played a game with a server system.\n\nI wouldn't pay more than a couple bucks for this game and if you're planning on beating it, hope to God your power doesn't go out or the game doesn't crash while it's minimized because no one has the kind of time or patience to complete this mess.\n\n2 / 10\n\nWorthless waste of time.","January 8, 2014","false","3.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","4","9","3","0"

I have read so many complaints about the game not working and nothing fixing it and the developers are already touting some new game they are working on in the official hammerwatch forum. This is insulting considering I paid for the game it will not work and I am not very hopeful at this point that the issue will be fixed.\n\nIf there is no reply from someone on how to fix this or that there is a fix on the way in a timely fashion then I want a refund for the software I was sold that didn't function.\n\nMy biggest regret is not reading more about the game not working or I wouldn't have bought it to begin with.\n\nI cannot recommend this unless you like to gamble.\n\nAlso the game is 7.99 on the hammerwatch website and is DRM free and steam redeeemable and it is 9.99 on steam without the DRM free version.

The game's presentation and story, within the first 45 minutes, is nowhere to be found. There's no goal beyond kill pixelated enemies and grabbing coins (which works for some games, but not in Hammerwatch's case). This type of beginning setup is only fun for the first playthrough, and quickly becomes stale afterwards.\n\nAlso, losing all your lives to an enemy or trap that you haven't yet learned how to overcome, and THEN being forced to start back at the very beginning of the game, is an extremely archaic function and has no place in the modern world of gaming. It absolutely killed my desire to go back and replay. This game isn't randomly generated and offers little incentive to return to it, and trudging through the snore-inducing level design was not going to happen.\n\nOverall, Hammerwatch plays just how it looks - a game from 10 years ago.","March 13, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Kiting big groups of weak enemies and blowing them away with your attacks gets old quickly, and that's how almost every enemy encounter goes. Add to that the fact that you can only attack the direction you most recently moved (meaning you have to turn around for every attack) and combat becomes an excercise in tedium. This problem is compounded with minibosses which have a lot of health and do a lot of damage, meaning that the only way to fight them is with constant "pokes", moving toward them, attacking, and moving away. And you must do this very quickly and do it a lot. It just isn't fun.\nLevel design looks awkward like in many roguelike games, but it is entirely pre-designed. There are some pretty horrendous "puzzle" systems, most of which consist of re-exploring empty areas looking for switches, breakable walls, and de-activated traps to find new routes. Think Metroid-vania but without movement itself being an enjoyable experience. In fact, movement is pretty bad all around. You walk slowly when unhindered and attacking cuts your speed even further.\nAlso, there's a lives system. Why? Lives were introduced in arcade games to keep people from hogging the machines. There's no reason for this to be here in an individually owned singleplayer game. There's no reason to keep players from continuing and retrying in a pre-designed area, It's understandable in roguelike adventures where there's always something new each time you play, but here all it does is add a cheap attribute of difficulty.","October 10, 2014","false","1.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anoriginalconcept/recommended/239070/","anoriginalconcept","Fish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anoriginalconcept/","66 products in account","In Hammerwatch, you'll fight hundreds of reskinned enimies, smash countless containers for coins, and solve simple puzzles.\n\nEnemies are beaten in the same way: aggro, attack, and backpedal.   This cycle makes up the majority of the gameplay.  Larger groups can be killed as they vainly attempt to path around a corner.  It's trivial and boring.\n\nIt's important to be careful.  Groups of enemies can kill you in a few seconds so it's unwise to play recklessly.  Health restoring items are limited and if you run out of lives, you're forced to start all over.  Cautious play is required.\n\nMoney is acquired by smashing pots that litter the corridors.  It's not fun, but it's necessary to improve your character.  Some pots randomly have bombs hidden in them - what's the point?   It just makes the process more tedious.\n\nUpgrades are purchased from shops scattered around the map.  For the most part, they're bland, numerical improvements.  On my Wizard, I increased my range, damage, and blast radius by roughly 20% across the board.  I also purchased the ability to combo.\n\nBy killing ten enemies in quick succession, your character is granted a buff that increases movement speed and damage.  This buff can be upgraded to provide minor healing and radial projectiles that fire every second.\n\nHowever, as I previously mentioned, Hammerwatch punishes aggressive play.  The combo system doesn't really fit in a game where health needs to be conserved.\n\nLoot consists of money, keys, health pickups, shop tokens, and small buffs to stats.  Shop tokens reduce the cost of upgrades by ~.5%.  Nothing here makes me want to play.\n\nHammerwatch is simply a boring game.  Any enjoyment from killing ememies is lost after the first couple hundred, it's annoying to scrounge for money, and character customization customization is dull.\n\nIf you're considering buying this game, watch a youtube video without a voiceover for ten minutes, and decide for yourself if it looks fun.","December 31, 2014","false","5.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This sounds like an rpg but feels more like a fast paced action game. The controls are simple and it's easy to pick up. The game can be played cooperatively up to 4 players which is perhaps the biggest draw to this game. Also the art style is quite nice.\n\nPersonally, I do not recommend this game because it's really shallow and gets tedious quite fast. The classes don't feel very unique, the fighting is simple button mashing and the puzzles are not that great to begin with. With some friends it's a tad more enjoyable but the horrible lag and netcode makes it hard to enjoy. It is actually quite impossible to get decent servers. After playing a while it just gets boring and it's not worth it.\n\n","January 6, 2015","false","3.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This is the definition of a hack n' slash. If you're into that genre of videogame, Hammerwatch is definitely for you. The graphics are poor of course, as it is developed by an unknown indie label named Crackshell. But that doesn't bother me as much as does the world (or lack of world I should say). The whole of a nearly 7-hour campaign took place underground in a single dungeon. I get that it's a dungeon-crawler, but at least change the setting of every few levels or something. Furthermore, it didn't have much variety when it came to the enemies you fought: scarabs or bats, take your pick. The only positive thing I can think to write about this game is the variety in classes. For the limited artwork, each class had an array of abilities that were quite aesthetically pleasing as they tore through hundreds of monsters at once. Also note that the game is planned to have a free DLC available sometime in the near future with implemented changes. Thus, be aware that they may fix some of the negatives I've mentioned above.\n\nWith that said, it is still not worth the full $10. If you are persistent in trying it, wait for one of Steam's bigger sales.\n\nThumbs down for now.\n\nEDIT: The game recently updated and has introduced a new campaign set in a desert of sorts. Feel free to comment whether or not it's any good, as I have not yet had a chance to play it.","December 29, 2015","false","7.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The retro graphics of this title seem to work out pretty well as they reflect on its minimalistic nature which btw.\nis just as absolutely uninspiring as the generic battle music that plays in the background without context.\n\nThis is dungeon crawling striped down to it's bare bones.\nNo inventory, grindy/slow character progression, beyond-basic combat\nthat comprises of mashing the same melee/ranged-attack button over and over again.\nExtremely inconsistent difficulty curve. There are hords of enemies that go down with one or two\nhits yet swarms of tanky slugs that you will need to run from in order to avoid a barrage of projectiles. Later enemy encounters often feature combinations of previously fought ones untill they are used to death.\nThe level design is somewhat interesting as it's vast with quite a number of secrets to seek out\nyet involves a lot of fetch-quests and levels are all in all way too long for what little gameplay they have to offer. Having 40 long achievements to unlock (Collect 1.000.000 coins...srsly?...) doesn't help in raising the playvalue/replayability one bit.\n\nThis title gets -1/10 "I don't even"s from me.\nI absolutely recommend to stay away from this title by all means.

The different characters means you have several ways even at that to do it and the checkpoints say that there is only a set amount of errors or not. Lives do play a factor so spend them wisely. It's like i'm playing gauntlet all over again. All though i'm not spending quarters standing at my feet with 3 other's at the cabinet is not the feeling there. The curvature on the screen feature at least gives me the benefit to have it somewhat like i'm there. It helps relive some suble memory of it being a arcade cabinet while having fun.

I would highly recommed playing with friends as you can shout at each other when someone dies or appreciat each other and you will feel great satisfaction when beating bosses.

Alas, those few positive traits are all the game has to compensate for the uninspired monotony of the core gameplay.  Disappointingly dull for an action game, disappointingly simplistic for an RPG, and incredibly repetative.\n\nSince I'm tired and lazy like so many other steam users, I will now stop writing an actual review and just make a list of positives and negatives.\n\n+Very good pixel art.  Always nice to see games where pixel art graphics are a stylistic choice, and not just used because it seems easier than other visual styles.\n+The secrets make the game a lot more interesting on their own, and would increase replay value substantially if the core gameplay it was built on had any kind of nuance.\n\n-If there's a tutorial of any kind, it's not immediately apparent.  Thankfully the controls aren't particularly complex, although they are a little odd by default.\n-I don't think there's any story.  If there was, I wasn't made privy to it.  I don't need anything great, it doesn't even have to be a big part of the game, but really?  The only story I get at the start is an NPC across a broken bridge saying "The bridge!"?  Not even a quick "the castle is overrun please save us!"?\n-Thus far it seems the entirety of combat is handled with 2 buttons, one mana using ability and one main attack.  This might have been enough to make for an interesting game, but combat really ends up just being about mashing main attack button while trying to strafe, with the occasional special (usually just a higher damage attack of some sort) thrown in.\n-Repetative af\n-Slow movement makes for a dull action game","July 27, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/campeao/recommended/239070/","campeao","BARBA","http://steamcommunity.com/id/campeao/","104 products in account","I'll start with my veredict on this game: despite being addictive, it's not a well made game.\n\n\nThe gameplay: what most annoyed me in this game was that the designers didn't care a bit about explaining important things to players - the first example that comes to my head are potions: you found an yellow potion? that's cool, bro! now Alt+Tab and GOOGLE it 'yellow potion hammerwatch'. That adds to the amateur aura the game has because of its graphics (see below).\n\nThe gameplay(2): I don't think a game necessarily has to have a history, it actually annoys me. But Hammerwatch just drops you on a dungeon without a single word! It's just like that: this is you and this is your dungeon. Now walk and fight. It's pretty odd.\n\nThe graphics: they certainly made the increasingly commom mistake - they mistake retro visual style with ugly graphics. The colors haven't been well chosen, the sprites of the scenarios aren't attractive at all. Comparing this game's graphics with, for example, 8-bit-like-graphics Retro City Rampage puts this one to shame.\n\nThe audio: the soundtrack isn't really bad, but they could have come up with more tracks, because the loops make the current ones annoying.\n\nThe enemies: I remember playing Castlevania - Symphony of the Night and having to fight over 300 different kinds of foes. Meanwhile, in Hammerwatch, they didn't really feel like designing more than 5 different enemies for a game you take a few hours to complete. "Oh, you think we should have made different foes? Well, let's just give some of the existing ones a new color and more speed and health"\n\nCo-op: You played for 2 hours with friends but you would like to change your class? FORGET IT! i mean: what's this guys' problem? Why can't i start with another character and no upgrades at all?\nOne of your friends has to leave and you and your remaining 2 friends wanna carry on playing? FORGET IT! start again just the 3 of you.\n\nWhat's sad, in the end, is that it could have made an outstanding game, had it been made more carefully","May 5, 2015","false","22.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Multiplayer is fantastic... until you run out of lives. Then it feels like single player again with your friends watching. The game doesn't give enough lives to balance out multiplayer and you will eventually end up trying to find lives just so that your friends can play again. This is a horrible setup for a multiplayer experience.","March 27, 2015","false","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
