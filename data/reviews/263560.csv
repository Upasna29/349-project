The skills for each character feel unique and the enemies are diverse.  The difficulty ranges from super easy to nearly impossible “80s” style.  The main downside is that all of the dungeons look very similar and can get repetitive.  The optional catacombs can be explored to break things up but I would have enjoyed more diversity of level design.  The music is definitely not winning any awards but I felt like it fit in with the style the developers were going for.\n\nI really had fun with it and if you enjoy turn based RPGs then at $5, it’s worth a buy, but if you are on the fence and you feel like the graphics/style might not be for you, then skip it.  You’re probably right.","January 23, 2014","true","8.9"," 87 of 105 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","87","105","0","2"

Yes, it's nice to see an old-school turn-based dungeon crawler being made. Yes, it's really impressive that it's pretty much all the work of one guy. Mad props to him.\n\nBut none of that changes the fact that Paper Sorcerer is a glitchy mess with serious balance issues. That these glitches and balance issues remain after the game has been out for so long is surprising. There are many game-crashing bugs - seriously, if you ignore this review, save often - especially before you try to leave your room in the game's town area, as there's a glitch there that will randomly crash the game. And the first three bosses will kill you, while the rest will meekly let you by - one of them will literally refuse to fight you.\n\nWhat really killed the game for me, though, and what prompted me to write this review, is that there's this neat minigame within the game where you're solving puzzles and opening secret doors throughout the dungeon, in anticipation of a big payoff near the end of the game. That payoff, the thing you put in the extra hours for, the thing you put your characters at risk for, is glitched, such that when you finally get to the end, you can't get it. When you get to the final set of doors that the big reward lies beyond, the game forgets you have the key to those doors. You get nothing - no in-game reward, no achievement, nothing. From perusing the forums, this is a huge bug that has been around for a long time, and which the developer has refused to fix.\n\nGlitchy, unbalanced, plays all of its neat tricks right up front, wears out its welcome. I'm disappointed.","June 21, 2015","false","17.0"," 69 of 86 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","69","86","0","0"

There are numerous "secrets" throughout the game, though they are pretty easy as the game almost always tells you when there is something to be found nearby. But the dungeon crawling/looting/fighting part is...well, fun.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot recommend the game at this time. There are some serious bugs, such as a door not opening even if you have the right key (and it has to do with the hardest "secret" in the game - so it's extremely frustrating doing all the work towards that for nothing). There are also some achievements that have been broken since release nearly two years ago, and as the developer has quit coming around months ago after the promise of an update that never occurred, it seems that this game has been abandoned.","September 17, 2015","false","19.1"," 39 of 49 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","39","49","0","0"

Whatever happened to simplicity? Simplicity is bliss and we should enjoy simpler elements without them being saturated in heavy cutscenes or hand holding. Well my friends, welcome to Paper Sorcery.\n\nAt its core it's a strategy, dungeon crawler RPG, examples of this would be the Wizardry series and to some extent Final Fantasy. You traverse dungeons, slay monsters, get loot. Simple right? It would be if there wasn't a strong skill system, character choices and loot options, yes there isn't always a X>Y when it comes to loot. While the combat may seem bare bones to the average incomprehensible fool, it's actually quite deep and for the most part well thought out for a game of this size. There is a huge variety of skills and character combinations, making every group unique and gives them a different playstyle from one another.\n\nNow to acknowledge the elephant in the room, the art style. The game's sprites are hand-drawn, and might I say very high-res. Now while the monsters look very generic when it comes to a fantasy setting there's such a large variety of monsters it can be glanced over as you never really see the same types of monsters outside their respective blocks. Less could be said for the UI and the animations of combat which leave much to be desired as they're very simple and seem nearly uninspired when compared to all the other art assets. My favourite sections would have to be the open areas before each boss, huge rooms which boast no boundaries, allowing for some unique backdrops\n\nSo is this game perfect? No, but for $5 you're not going to get much better. The game suffers from no options menu outside resolution, which are chosen before you load the game. At least audio sliders are needed, as much as I enjoy some of the music they're very overpowering and sometimes I just like to listen to the combat sounds. Keyboard functionality is their, but it is very very lacking, clicking through menus seems sluggish and keys such as 'esc' do nothing for the most part. There are also some graphical glitches, though very minor and in no way affect the gaming experience.\n\nFor $5 this is a steal, tonnes of content and replay value. It boasts a unique artstyle using blank space which only adds to the amazingly solid RPG experience. Also, did I mention a single man made this?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dtox508/recommended/263560/","dtox508","d.Tox508","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dtox508/","217 products in account","For every horrible game that Kickstarter is responsible for, their’s always one that breaks the mold and stands out. I remember supporting Paper Sorcerer from the beginning stages when it was still in Kickstarter, waiting patiently for the day that I would finally be able to play this masterpiece. Its hard for a game to be so simple and complex at the same time, yet Paper Sorcerer seems to do just that. What you might think is a plain and boring video game ends up coming to life and involving you deep into the plot.\n\nMy first thoughts and impressions had me thinking that this game was obviously going to be totally awesome. I knew I had to have it after watching only the KS trailer, and once it made its way to Steam I was all over it. Within the first 5 minutes I was reminded of Dungeons & Dragons, playing with friends and calling out tactical moves. The turn based fighting system is well thought out and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Over are the days of the 3 minute bash sessions of games like Pokemon or Final Fantasy; Paper Sorcerer delivers tactical, powerful and serious battle sequences lasting longer than your average role player. The story line is action filled, as well as giving you the ability at points to choose what direction the scenes will go.\n\n“A powerful sorcerer is on the cusp of dominating the land. A group of heroes bands together and seals him away inside a magical tome. Now as the sorcerer you must escape from this ancient prison and find a way to regain your magical powers using your wits and an array of summonable creatures to aid you. There may be more powerful forces at work as you navigate the dungeons and fight the heroes sent to subdue you… Paper Sorcerer is a stylish turn based RPG focused on strategy, party-building, and environmental puzzles. Fight with the skills and spells you have learned in a battle system that emphasizes strategy over grinding. Assemble a party of monsters and dark creatures to fight alongside you. Explore and solve environmental puzzles to unlock secret paths and find extra loot.” – Paper Sorcerer\n\nGraphically this game must have been more challenging to animate than it would seem. With basically only 2 monochrome colors to work with, Paper Sorcerer is a artistic masterpiece and plays out more like a graphic novel than a video game. Although you have full navigation as the game is in the first person, on my 32 inch its like playing a giant fairy tale book that’s come to life. The subtle use of color throughout the game is genius and fits perfectly, from the effects of spells to the health and energy bar every detail has been covered. Each battle is reminiscent of the older Final Fantasy, where instead of the hero moving and performing each command, its represented by a small graphic, color or sound. As I’ve said in the past, its the simplicity that can make a game as good as it is, and that is certainly the case with Paper Sorcerer. The imagery in this game is absolutely amazing, and the use of essentially 2 colors is almost intoxicating.\n\nPaper Sorcerer is as fun as it is challenging. I like games like these because the battles later in game are hard, but you’ve been prepared by several battles before it so you have an idea what you’re in for. I really enjoyed the turn based fighting system because each member of your party has a role that is greatly needed during battle. Party formation is one of the toughest parts of early game, and essential to continued play in later levels. You will need a tank, healer, and a ranged hero to make it anywhere (you already have magic covered, as you are a sorcerer), and Paper Sorcerer certainly gives you that option with a choice of several different heroes to choose from. Items are pivotal to game play, equipping each of your heroes with the proper weapons, shields and runes are key to completing each floor. Fighting is very important, because this game doesn’t focus solely on damage to end battles, you need to play more tactfully and use skills to buff strength and agility while making sure you keep your defense up.\n\nIts the little things that count sometimes in a game that make or break it. One of these things is the difficulty setting when you first begin your game; you’re given the options Easy, Medium, Hard & 1980’s. The first time around, i chose 1980’s for the hell of it… lets just say that your first battle which is almost a guaranteed win, is a guaranteed loss. This was obviously a setting for the more experienced players of Paper Sorcerer. About the only thing I really didn’t like about the game other than the fact you cant use a controller, is the music. I have no idea who is responsible for it, but it needs a major overhaul and update. It just doesn’t fit well with the game whatsoever.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, Paper Sorcerer is a great game, and highly suggested. So many different elements hold this game together making it a solid play through. Loaded with secrets and strong attention to detail, each item counts, and every room needs inspecting. Retro like an old D&D MSDos game and as modern as a new age RPG, everything about Paper Sorcerer is entertaining.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nPlayability: 7/10\nStory: 7/10\nChallenge: 7/10\nReplay Value: 7/10","August 14, 2014","true","20.6"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","0"

Worried you might not have enough weapons for your party? Choose a werewolf and rip the enemy to shreds with his unnarmed claw attacks.

The trailer, screenshots, and overall aesthetic are impressive to be sure, but they belie a cumbersome user interface (for a genre that is 90% menus, why are the menus so annoying to use?), a sluggish battle system, and overall very dull mechanics that offer little in the way of exciting character molding or customization. A dungeon crawler must dangle the excitement of pushing forward and advancing your characters bit by bit, but Paper Sorcerer's skill system has no appeal and the battles are a chore of poorly-telegraphed information and so, so much waiting.\n\nI want to like this game, and I truly do appreciate the efforts to bring more dungeon crawlers to the market, but Paper Sorcerer is a meandering and unfocused product in serious need of more thought-out game design and revised UI design.\n\nAs a $5 game, it is admittedly worth a try, even with the simplistic gameplay & numerous bugs (none of them game-breaking so far, at least) -- but if you value your time even moreso, my suggestion is to try out Legend of Grimrock on Steam or The Dark Spire on DS, two games in the same style that deliver a much more captivating experience.\n\nIn short: be wary. The paper aesthetic is so fresh and appealing that it's easy to assume the rest of the game is just as polished, but unfortunately the core gameplay is miles behind what I would expect from a 2014 Wizardry-like. Will you find it fun? It's hard to predict -- but if you keep up with the scant few post-2000 dungeon crawlers like I have, the answer will probably be No, because Paper Sorcerer decidedly does not want to do anything unique with the core genre.","February 3, 2014","false","1.2"," 28 of 42 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","28","42","0","1"

Long story short; it's good but glitchy, get it later.\n\nThe battle mechanics make you think about every move you are making and the longer fights go the more dangerous they get.  This was definitely my favourite thing with the game. The battles are difficult and getting your butt kicked doesn't mean grinding, you just have to change your strategy.\n\nThe story was alright, it is paced well and has a bit of humor and charm. I like the graphics too, I've always ahd a soft-spot for stylized graphics. The sound is alright, some of the boss songs stand out and are pretty cool.\n\nI WOULD recommend the game but just not now, there are too many issues that need ot be corrected. The menu interface is garbage, it is quite awkward having to scroll through the menus for skills or items. I only went through my equipment after leaving a cell block because it is too much of a hassle. During battle the text often overlaps and selecting attacks often got a bit tiring. I often encountered sound or graphical glitches which were not too big of a deal, just made it feel unpolished. I even encountered a few problems with controls after using the Gem of Recall that made me have to reset the game entirely. The kicker came when I was in cell block 7-1, I had found everything I found the switch to open the last secret on the floor but when I when to the wall that should have moved it was still closed (I had saved after the switch, also). I could no longer interact with ANYTHING on the floor including the chest or the switch.

This is a great FP dungeon crawler RPG, heavily influenced by some of the best old school games such as the Wizardry titles. Very unique looking art design, and most importantly: no hand holding at all! The enemies offer fun challenges, it's not just generic trash mobs, with each level having its own unique elements and combat will require some use of tactics. There are different companions you can choose from, with many different viable party set-ups. Each main level has optional puzzles and hidden secrets; exploration is very enjoyable. The only downside is perhaps the music, which I thought didn't really fit the game. It would have been a much more atmospheric experience had the music been darker, more suspenseful.

I finally picked up the game in a bundle, and when I felt like some dungeoning, I started playing this.\n\nFirst of all, without even getting into gameplay, the music is awesome. This is easily a game I could see myself opening up just to listen to the music when I felt like hearing something upbeat, somewhat retro, and just...unique. From the battle music to simple background music, this game has some serious tunes, and that is not to be underestimated. The music keeps you pumped up through hours of playtime, easily.\n\nThe artwork never actually felt colorless to me. As you progress through the game, the hues do change, and some levels have a reddish hue, others have green hues, etc. The art is absolutely spectacular, and the battle action effects add color, movement, and even more flair. This is a fun game just to watch, even for others. There were plenty of times I caught my husband watching my battles from over my shoulder. :)\n\nGameplay-wise, this is a dungeon crawler at its best. You play as a sorcerer (believe it or not), and you get to summon creatures to help you, gaining more over the first half of the game. The numbers of unique skills these creatures have is unbelievable. Even after surpassing levels 30 and beyond, you'll still not only be unlocking higher levels of your skills, but more new skills. For anyone who loves unlocking awesome things while leveling up (and doing it often), this game is THE game to buy.\n\nReplayability is through the roof here. This game will take around 20 hours for a single playthrough, give or take depending on difficulty (easy through 1980s), player skill and strategy, and whether or not you stop to find all of the secrets in the game. Even though you can summon multiple creatures, you can never summon all of them (there are quite a few). There are enough summons to span across two playthroughs, and that's assuming you don't mix them up at all.\n\nThe ONLY negative I have to put out there about this game is a small one. There are quite a few spelling and grammar mistakes in the dialogue. The game could have benefited from having an editor go over the text, but in saying that, it in no way takes away from the enjoyment of the game, and not once did I get confused because of these small mistakes. It will serve as no more than a pet peeve for those of us who notice these types of transgressions.\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 5/5, or a 9.5/10, take your pick. It's a great value for the price, it has high replay value, and it's worth it just to experience the atmosphere, and without even considering gameplay (which as stated, is superb). The easier difficulties would also serve well as an introduction of a dungeon crawler to someone who is interested in the genre but perhaps not quite as experienced, as it is easy to learn, but hard to pull away from. ;)","June 26, 2014","true","29.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","1"

I'm not a fan of the 8 bit chip music but thankfully that changes as the game progresses. High level of tactical choice for your party and equipment can radically add to the high level of customisation. Plenty of secrets and varied boss fights.

Pleasant to look at both because it is different and nice.\n\nBut otherwise, I found the gameplay very repetative. The first levels are fun, but then I realized as I progressed, that the only differences were a slight change in the surroundings, enemies and music. Combat is always the same, and most fights end up being repeating one or two different combinations of skills from your four characters.\n\nWhat I found most fun about this game was the secret hunting. Not very difficult, but it was more or less the only thing that varied across the levels.\n\nThe story was presented in text, but I didn't experience any depth in it. The whole idea of it is different and entertaining, but it is presented casually, and after a short while I couldn't get rid of the feeling that it is just a context to put the game in without any farther meaning.\n\nI haven't finished the game, but I keep trying to progress to see if it may have anything else to offer, as it seems pretty long. But repeating the same combat sequences for 9 hours of gameplay appears demotivating. I can still recommend to try this game just for the visual style and some old school atmospherics, but I don't thik it is worth spending more than a few hours on.","August 30, 2014","false","9.9"," 26 of 42 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","26","42","0","0"

What's your killer combo party layout? Not surprising that the longest thread on the forum is about party builds.\n- Don't forget the special puppet you find along the way - Have you managed to get proper components to build him up to a killer puppet?  Build a tank, mage, flame thrower or artery slicing doll. You decide as you gather doll parts.\n- Skills galore. Later as you build up your skills every move is mostly a grand strategy of what skills to choose and when during combat. Game is generous as it allows a pretty wide range of summon creaturea that can be swapped in/out between fights as you wish. Each with their own specialities.\n- The 'paper' in the title does not affect mechanics in any bizarre way so don't be distracted by it too much.. it is more related to the plot and graphics style.\n- Good range of difficulty settings. This game can be really punishing or casual, just the way you want it. Hard it seems is the recommended setting for people who want punishment as the normal setting is such that early game is hard but later on you rarely break a sweat. 1984 mode for the truly hardcore.\n- Good looking graphics and artwork with a hand-drawn look.\n\nGame is silly cheap and discounted often too. a true gem that is easily worth full price.\n\n10/10","September 7, 2015","true","19.3"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

I really did. I want to support indie games, and the premise that this is based on - an homage to the choose-your-own-adventure books spawned of the 80's - is one very near and dear to my heart. At first, it even looked good, with the charming reproduction of pen-and-paper outsider art baked into everything you look at. But that charm quickly wears away, and what you're left with is grinding, bugs, and a seething, unfortunate sort of RPG genericness.\n\nThe battle system is quickly understood, and whatever quirkiness and customization the party-summon mechanic brings is quickly locked away behind a gruesome wall of grinding. The battles get very old, very fast, with little strategy beyond "kill the guys with the annoying abilities first". Even the outsider-art graphics get old, as you see so damn much of the same damn thing. I could write the story out on a bar napkin. By spitting on it. And then there are the rampant bugs, that make a dull experience into an infuriating one - doors that don't work, crashes when you return to town.\n\nThis game came from a good place, and had a good start, but it's awful.

I'd most probably continue playing the game, but I just could not withstand the user interface any more. It is so bad that it's hard to describe, it has be to experienced (and I suggest you do not). It is the worst user interface I've seen in games, ever.\n\nThe game itself is good enough, it has party variety, it has quite interesting enemies, and it has a few new concepts such as lowering defense during combat. I really like the fact that no matter how good your armor is, with enough effort you will cut through it eventually. Unfortunately this mechanic is not well explained and it lacks some polish and (especially) detailed explanation how it really works. But overall, the gameplay is solid. The environment is lacking, but it's still borderline good enough.\n\nWhat kills this game is UI. I think the developer would be in fact able to design better interfaces (just by copying what you see in ever other game you get a 100x more usable UI), but he's just not technically skilled to create it. This is his first game and he has no real programming skills. The official website even confirms it "Ultra Runaway Games was created when  one man with no industry experience or programming training decided to make a PC RPG.". And when you read his comments on forums that music volume cannot be adjusted because he doesn't know how to implement a slider, it's just... sad. Don't take me wrong, he has a courage and a passion, and if he really knew nothing about programming in the beginning, this is a very good result. But still, that doesn't make this game playable, unfortunately.\n\nThe UI is simply horrible and you spend more time fighting with the UI than fighting with enemies. Even basic tasks like looking at the inventory is extremely cumbersome and slow. Battles are excruciatingly slow because of the way how you give commands. And the list goes on.\n\nThere are even some bugs, but often it's just horrible UI or design decision in action. For example, you pick up a plate armor, then you look into inventory, and it's not there. WTF? You load and try it again, same result. A bug? No, a design decision to not show you any item in inventory that you cannot use at that moment. (Or at least that's what I assume it is, it is not explained anywhere). But it "appears" once you want to sell it. So much time wasted figuring this out...\n\nThere are other technical issues that will slightly drive you mad, but I think most of them boil down to simply insufficient programming skills of the developer.\n\nIt's unfortunate, because this is very close to the "my kind of game", but I can't recommend this at its present state. If there are some patches in the future that will completely overhaul the user interface, then sure, this can become an entertaining game. At present not worth it, though.","June 29, 2015","false","0.1"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

You explore various dungeons not in a way unlike the old school game 'Moraff's Revenge'.\nThe main appeals of the game are its atmosphere, its rpg setting, its choices of playable characters/minions and acessibility.

It has neat artwork, a decent story, and a host of interesting classes.  However, the programming team was either inexperienced or rushed in finishing this game.  The programming on this game is horrible.  While other areas, like artwork, look fairly well polished, there is a critical lack of basic polish on the code.  I've seen flash games with better polish.\n\nLet's start off with text prompts.  You see that screenshot showcasing the spell list, with the funky alignment issues?  That's a small taste of what I'm talking about.  Text is screwed up everywhere!  Much of the interfaces look like they paid some 16-year-old who barely speaks English to design it.  There are misspellings, case issues, text alignment issues, design flaws, and yes, bugs and glitches, which are well covered in other reviews.\n\nTrying to play this on a controller is fruitless.  Even when you map the keys, you'll find that the main button for doors and items is permanently bound to the left mouse button.  And sometimes it will crash in the middle of the binding menu.  Also, why are there two binding menus?  Seriously... there's one on the pre-start screen, and one in game.\n\nEquipment management can be a pain.  You can't revert to a previous character during the fight menu.  You can't see any stats from any of the enemies.  Enemies before a fight are just blobs on the screen, which is a bit of a cop out.

Really required luck and a fully rested party instead of skill.\n- Character status needs to show magic defenses.  Magic defenses are on gear and available through skill trainer, but not viewable.\n- Intro story concept was pretty neat.

It tries very, very hard. But it fails and ends up falling flat on its face. Grinding can become a necessity in this game, especially on higher difficulties. Unfortuantely, enemies in the main dungeons do not respawn. To grind, you need to go to the game's secondary dungeon, of which the lower levels are unlocked by finding semi-hidden spirits in the game's main tower. Normally this would not be an issue, but the secondary dungeon seems to have a random spawn rate. I competed the first floor with no encounters at all, while the second floor flung me into combat every few seconds. In addition to the grinding, treasure chests are completely random, and not in a good way. You could find one of the most common swords in the game, or you could find some overpowered god-slaying weapon of mass destruction. And if you don't like the loot, you can load your save and try again; this wouldn't be a bad thing if it wasn't for the fact that it could possibly require hours of resets to get the best items from each chest. The music also varies from fitting to incredibly annoying. After hearing the town, dungeon, and battle theme for the thousandth time, you will start to lose any motivation to finish this game. Some boss battles have nice music, but overall it's annoying music loops. Last but not least, the bugs in this game are everywhere and the developer has made no mention of them for over a year.

Don't be fooled by the minimalistic art-style, which I actually find to be refreshing.  It's nice to play a game where the challenge is one of my mental acuity and not visual acuity!  Letting my eyes take a break while I do epic battle is nice.\n\nStory is simple, but consistent.  You won't necessarily fall in love with it in the way you do some Epic poem like the Illiad or a game like Baldur's Gate or something, but it has a neat premise that fits well with the format of the game.  You'll find nice tidbits of humor laced throughout the game as well.\n\nYou will most likely have to become a better player to meet the challenge of this game.  It is a worthy adversary and one that I will treasure for all time.  Definitely one of the best turn-based RPGs ever.

Fun, but pretty hard.  1980's mode is freakin impossible!  But despite the fun, its got alot of flaws that made me kinda quit half way through.\n\nEssentailly, its a good game, but it needed alot of play testing that it obviously never got.  Not because its glitchy, but because the balancing is all off.  Some skills are basically useless (which happens in alot of rpgs), so your often limited to two or three viable skills per class.  Too many skills either are WAY underpowered, or simply don't give you the status effect they say they will.  (or the chance to miss is so freakin high that why bother.)\n\nAll in all, not to bad for a one-man shop, and I DO RECOMMEND IT, but it really is in desperate need of some skill balancing.

The wide variety of summons/minions that you get to pick from (limit of 3 at a time) gives you a huge range of different party types.  Don't worry about out levelling old minions though as they actually level up with you regardless which means you can swap minions in and out at will (outside combat) and try out new combinations for particular situations (for example the Abomination is perfect for dealing with spellcasters but only does light healing compared to the Witch) ...\n\nDon't be fooled into thinking this game isn't trying to trick you!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ceireavne/recommended/263560/","ceireavne","Rhavviepoodle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ceireavne/","189 products in account","Paper Sorcerer is a turn-based RPG and dungeon crawler with a stylistic flair. First off, there's a somewhat monochromatic theme throughout the game, alongside heavy contrast thanks to fairly common shadows. Thus when colors do appear, they're much more striking. While the sprites and animation themselves aren't the best, the total effect of the game was a minimalistic experience which I found rather refreshing. The developers are still sorting out a few kinks with the game, such as being able to adjust game volume and the like. That wasn't a problem for me, as I found the soundtrack helped set the mood of the game and all told was a fan of it.\n\nAs for the gameplay, you are a sorcerer bound in a magic tome, with the objective of fighting your way out. Your party consists of minions whom you summon with your arcane powers. Some of this game's stylistic charm comes from the fact that instead of the cut-and-dry mage/fighter/thief, your minions are themselves monsters: minotaurs, vampires, ghosts, imps, and the like. This comes off across a lot less as anti-heroes as you'd think it would, but it was another thing I found quite refreshing about this game.\n\nThe combat itself is quite fun and has depth, while managing to keep things simple enough. One of my qualms with the normal difficulty setting was that after a point, the combat was a bit too easy, though there are harder difficulties to fix that problem. A good deal of the gameplay comes from exploring dungeons and finding secrets. These can range from easy to very puzzling, with the harder ones being more rewarding to complete. This aspect of the gameplay fits in very well with the rest, the result being an excellent dungeon delving experience.\n\nSo I can't tell you this game is perfect, but I don't really think it tries to be. When I first saw this game, I got "art game" vibes from it, but actually playing it, Paper Sorcerer comes off much less pretenious than that. The final product here is a laid-back (if somewhat minimalistic) dungeon crawl. It has breadth without being overly complicated, and most importantly it was refreshing. For five dollars, this is definitely worth picking up: if you're a fan of turn-based RPGs, Paper Sorcerer is a solid game that you can sink both your teeth and your time into.","January 31, 2014","true","30.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game has a fantastic, unique art style and fun, classic turn-based battles\n\nWhat really sold the game for me though, was the interesting style used. Never played a game with a style such as this, and Paper Sorcerer pulled it off well. The game has you going about a black and white world that you, the sorcerer, has been trapped in. You'll end up building up a party of mythological creatures and monsters to fight alongside you in turn-based combat against various foes. There are plenty of puzzles scattered throughout the game, usually leading to some pretty cool loot.\n\nI'm not usually one to enjoy turn-based RPG's in this style, but this was a fantastic experience. It was just so much fun. Also, the game is only $5? What's not to lose here?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib6O6gkzZHM","February 8, 2014","true","0.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The first-person dungeon crawling is pretty much everything you've come to expect from these kinds of games, but the combat demands strategic use of all your party members' abilities and strengths. In fact, combat is really the best part of Paper Sorcerer. It may take the same amount of time to clear some normal packs of trash mobs in this game as it would to take on a boss from any other RPG, but the battles themselves are worth it and are infrequent and varied enough to keep from becoming too repetitive.\n\nUnfortunately, my recommendation of this game comes with some SEVERE hesitation. The entire user interface is an uncategorized, unformatted, and at times non-functioning mess. Thankfully the menu bugginess is mostly limited to non-combat situations, but it's still a major pain to work with such an aggressively bad UI. There are also a number of bugs that can occur while exploring the dungeon that may require a restart of the game, which will also re-close any doors you've opened making it harder to re-orient yourself afterward. There's either some slight inexperience going on here or the game needed to get booted out the door to satisfy Kickstarter backers.\n\nIf you want some engaging as hell combat and party customization and don't mind wading through some annoying bugs and terrible menus, by all means have a go at Paper Sorcerer.","March 4, 2014","true","17.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

With a great art style, solid gameplay, and interesting story it is definitely worth checking out if you are a fan of the genre.\n\nThe art in this game  is based on the fact that you are trapped in a book. The world looks as though it has been drawn around you . Essentially, Paper Sorcerer’s art style does what any good art style should do; it helps the game stand out, is pleasing to the eye, and further conveys the tone and story of the game. The sound also helps create a retro feel, with some 8-bit beeps and boops to take you back.\n\nThe gameplay can be rather repetitive, although, I never found myself bored by it. Battles are essentially clicking moves and watching the turns play out, which could likely be boring for many people but if you are a fan of old-school, turn-based combat, can be rather fun. Outside of combat there is a good amount to do with secrets and non-story areas to be found, explored, and conquered.\n\nThe story is rather interesting but could have been better told. I found it interesting, I just wish more attention was given to it.  Essentially, you are an evil sorcerer who is trapped in a magic book by four heroes and now need to fight your way out.\n\nIf you are looking for an old-school, turn-based RPG with a unique art style, interesting story, and solid gameplay then this is certainly worth the $4.99. Even if you are only possibly interested, I would recommend this as you will likely get more than your money’s worth with this game.","October 19, 2014","true","21.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The team making this game is obviously on a budget, and you can see some oddball errors (like inky shadows that are actually 2d planes you can see behind if you jump into the corner) but they decided to use their limited resources to make the most visually striking game they could, regardless.\n\nThe same can be said of combat, which is the real meat of the game.  The game uses pre-generated character archetypes that you add to your party in a team of your choosing.  The array of choices are unfortunately not overwhelming, and you don't get a very clear sense of who can do what until after you get them in your party, but if you save before the choice, and experiment a little, you can figure things out.\n\nCombat revolves around energy (which is used only 1-6 points at a time, and where you recover 1 per turn) and cooldowns on skills, as well as an unusual defense system.  Defense drops after physical attacks, and applies to both physical and magic attacks.  Since very high defense nullifies direct magic damage, you need to pound a target's armor down to make them vulnerable to magic.  Meanwhile, magic skills that debuff resistance to physical damage or can incapacitate a target are available, but only within the limits of energy and cooldowns.  It's a game that has unusual depth to how much you have to think to get through even regular battles. (Especially on the brutal "1980s" difficulty.)\n\nUnfortunately, the game also behaves oddly in many circumstances.  Ability cooldowns don't take as long as they say they do in the menu, and sometimes last into the next combat you engage in.  If you move the mouse while the 2d image of the town is loading, you actually make the perspective on the town move, as it's just a 2d cutout in front of the game's camera.  There's an achievement that you can't unlock because it was accidentally made inaccesible.\n\nThere's also some balance issues, especially with overpowered skills like sleep, where enemies  only wake up from normal attacks, while a skeleton that's using physical skills to kill the opponent never wakes the target.  This tends to make status effect and damage-over-time characters extremely powerful, while the characters that rely upon direct magic damage are extremely weak because of the way defense works against them.","November 11, 2014","true","98.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

TL/DR: messy and slow UI gets in the way.\n\nAesthetics: Tables aligned with spaces instead of using an actual grid layout, producing weird floppy margins.  Fill bars that don't fit in their containers.  Hard to read font.\n\nAnnoyance: between each line of dialog, the dialog window disappears and reappears.  That's useless, slow, and since the game is black and white it creates a disturbing flash.  Imagine someone flickering the light after each sentence.\n\nUsability: start the game in 1600x900 and look how the "Controls" button is covered by the others.  Admire how the mouse cursor lags behind...  the other mouse cursor? (yes, there are two).  You cannot use the keyboard to navigate menus because there is an artificial delay of half a second after each keypress so you have to press, wait, press, wait, press, wait, validate in order to select the third item from a list.  Speaking of validation: space, enter, numpad enter, click, doube-click, it's a mess.  The "Back" button acts sometimes as "OK", sometimes as "Cancel".  Fitts's law was totally ignored during the design, forcing you to swing your mouse all over in order to navigate the windows and menus.\n\nMaking UIs is hard, I know, there are entire books and university degrees about it, but when a game relies so heavily on it, one would expect basic errors to be avoided. If I cannot navigate menus at the speed of thought (which is totally possible, may games do it right), I feel like I'm fighting the game rather than playing it.","December 29, 2015","false","0.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Mildy irritating config bugs were irrelevant, just check after you load a game if they're correct. 5/5 stars... I'm sure the bugs will get ironed out. So far, I am only using the in-game config, but there is one when you start the game that I haven't touched... partially because the command descriptions don't mesh and I'm happy with the ingame one so far. (The inital one helps config controllers, so I give credit for that... just haven't tried it out yet)\n\nGames don't need next-gen graphics to be engaging, and this is proof of that. Well worth the money.\n\nPros: Dungeon Crawling Fix, easy on the eyes\n\nCons: Config could use work, no volume controls for effects & music.","February 14, 2014","true","142.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The art may be black and white and somewhat functional, but it is nonetheless stylish and helps you find your way around, which is really all you need.  The music problem (there is no ingame sound control) will be fixed soon, which is probably the only major gripe about this game. For me, though, it is the storytelling and the quirky sense of humour that shames other games that are ten times its asking price.  And that does not subtract at all from replays - maybe the normal setting is a bit easier than expected, but there are harder setting available, which are well worth the effort.  You will not get a better dungeon crawler for this sort of money.  Brilliant.

The ambience of the game reminds me of one of my all-time favourites, Ico.\n\nBasic idea of the game, as with many others, you start as a low level character, and have an end goal to complete, with smaller things to acheive along the way. Wander around dungeons exploring and completing them. Plus it lets you go back later to a level in case you think you missed something. (The acheivements are a clue to this!)\n\nPick up team members and let them level up with you. Party members can be switched in and out, depending on how you like them.\n\nCombat is nice, similiar in style I think to some Japanese RPGs. Turn based, decide who you want to hit/zap/heal/whatever and who you want to do it to, then wait for the round to play out.\n\nFor the price they are asking, you definitely get your moneys worth.","May 23, 2014","true","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It feels good.\nCHARACTERS: besides the main character (the sorcerer), you are able to summon other creatures, and there's a fairly wide variety of species to choose, with very distinct powers.CONs:\nMENUS BEHAVE VERY AWKWARDLY: sometimes they overlap each other and your keyboard keeps controlling the bottom one and your mouse the top one.\nHUD: I may be missing something, but I've played a few sessions already and never been able to see my opponents status. That's crazy! Oo\nINTERACTIONS: After the first time you interact with an object, it just ignores your later interactions, it reacts as if you were clicking on an empty space. Very annoying.\n\nAnd the list could go on and on....Super-honest (maybe harsh wrong) impressions about the team:\nGood artist + Bad programmer + So-so designer   = A game that has potential but needs better polish.","July 18, 2014","true","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirbumpsalot/recommended/263560/","sirbumpsalot","Bump","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sirbumpsalot/","152 products in account","What a fun game and a hidden gem. I picked Paper Sorcerer up on a whim and enjoyed my entire 20+ hour playthrough on normal. Probably will pick up again when the developer makes a few updates. You play as an inprisoned (inside a magical book) sorcerer able to summon 3 party memebers (thralls) to help you on your quest to escape.\n\nThe combat speed can be a little slow but I didn't mind. The variability of the thralls you choose to aid you is what I feel makes this game great. 3 healers, 2 (main) tanks, and several dps and buff/debuff characters to round it out keeps replayability high.\n\nI had a good romp with my team: Vampire (dps/heals), Skeleton (tank), Ghost (buff/debuff), on my playthough. I feel this game is about taking out or incapacitating your enemies before they take out you VS. a give and take of damage with a balanced party with a tank and healer. My opinion could change on a higher difficulty playthrough or if the developer changes the balance of the game.\n\nCombat remained fresh, really satisfied that RPG itch I didn't know I was craving. You constantly feel your team growing stronger through levels and new loot which is great.\n\nI also appreciated the visual style and music - different and maybe repetitive but I was sold on what the developer was conveying the moment I started the game.\n\nLike I said, a little game updating is necessary (some translations, which would make the ending more understandable / maaaybe a combat speed modifier / savable video and control layouts) but the developer seems to be on top of the community requests. Recommendation: Definitely Play - best 5 bucks I've spent in a long time.","February 15, 2014","true","30.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sadly, the campaign length is heavily padded out by the long and drawn-out fights. Being unable to speed up fights, restart already-lost ones, or load during one without quitting the game beforehand makes the fighting extremely tedious the further you get into the game (considering the difficulty jumps up noticeably on the last few floors)\nSome specific aspects of the combat system are unrefined. For example, if you queue up a heal spell on a party member, and they die before the spell is cast, you will essentially waste an action, as the game will still cast the spell on said dead party member, rather than using it on the next available/active party member (who may need it if the enemy has used an AOE skill or spell); small things like this really make fights harder than they should be\nThe random loot system makes it so the shop system is mostly pointless for other than selling items, as the equipment found in the field (even in the earlier levels) completely overshadows the ones sold in the shop. Finding unusable items (since you can find items for party members that you didn’t choose in the beginning, making them pointless to obtain for other than selling) is also pretty irritating- The games interface, while serviceable, is fairly slow to navigate and not streamlined enough\n- One of the few games where I barely paid any attention to the story beyond the beginning and ending; the gameplay is the only thing that will make an attempt to keep your attention until the end.\n\n\nVerdict\n“While I may have harped on a little about the minor gripes I have with Paper Sorcerer and its gameplay, those aspects of the game didn't drag the game down excessively; it was still an enjoyable experience (for the most part). If you are a fan of old-school dungeon-crawlers, and highly enjoy turn-based combat, this game does those aspects well enough to warrant experiencing. Considering how cheap the game is, even if you’re hesitant to pick it up, it won’t leave your wallet much lighter than before.”\n\n7/10 TJBs","January 30, 2015","true","11.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orpe11/recommended/263560/","orpe11","orpe11","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orpe11/","474 products in account","TL;DR: A first-person dungeon crawler with minimal story and some galling bugs, saved by a very fun combat system.\n\nThis is one of those reviews where I am rather conflicted about the recommendation. On one hand, Paper Sorcerer is one of the few games that I started playing, and I was compelled to keep going until I finished. No breaks, no stopping, I started and played it every evening until I finished it. On the other hand, it is a flawed game in some unacceptable ways, and I can understand other people not wanting to deal with the issues.\n\nPaper Sorcerer is a first person dungeon crawler. It is entirely that, meaning that once you start the game, you will be walking down corridors, opening doors, fighting enemies, finding treasure, etc. You do this for the entire game, except for occasional forrays into the hub town where you can buy things and rest. There is a story, and a reason why it looks monochrome-ish (You are in a book, hence the name), but it is entirely minimal, and it is actually a bit jarring at the end when the game suddenly seems to act like you care about the people you talked to. The cast is entirely limited to one friendly NPC who guides you through, a few shop NPCs, and the bosses you kill along the way. There are some further bits of story that you find in notes in rooms, but they are easily missable, and not very compelling. So if you want a compelling, interesting story...not really for you.\n\nPaper Sorcerer also has bugs. A lot of bugs. While the game does free itself from the adherence to grid-based movement other first person dungeon crawlers have, the designer didn't seem able to code some of it quite right. You will walk into a room, and the game will freeze for a moment, likely calculating some event, before letting you continue that otherwise smooth walk. This is most noticeable in your bedroom, where after initially looting it, you will most likely just walk to the bed, rest, and then walk out. This is hampered by every single time, the game hangs on something halfway to the bed, a second or two pause that will yank you out of the smooth movement every time. An actually major bug is that the game will forget doors are open upon loading. This includes doors locked with keys. So if you unlock a door, don't get everything inside, step back out, and save/load, you can't get back in. The most galling is the fact that the last puzzle in the game (upon which you have been gathering chess pieces for, working up to, etc), doesn't work. You get to the room, you have everything, and the doors just won't let you interact with them, denying you the last reward. Several achievements are bugged as well, not working on finishing the game (The book achievements) or puzzles (The last two or so puzzles),\n\nSo why is this still a recommendation? The designer has managed to make the combat in this game extremely fun. At the start, you just have the sorcerer, but soon you start acquiring party members by summoning old minions. Of a rather major note, all of the minions fall into 'DPS, Tank, Healer' sort of categories, but their actual play styles are quite different. In example, while the Vampire is noted as a Healer, he heals through draining life, using his own to cast major heals...and is also a fairly powerful DPS in his own right with his physical attacks. The large varieties of useful parties helps replayability if you enjoy the combat system...and I certainly did. The system eschews normal MP styles, instead using energy. Every character recovers 1 energy per turn, and most skills only use a few. After a few levels, every class gets a skill that lets you recover energy and gain a buff (For example, the Vampire recovers energy and buffs his magic for a few turns). All skills have a cool down, forcing you to use a wide variety instead of just spamming the same skills. This gives battle a bit of a rhythm, and lets you choose between low cost energy skills for rapid fire attacks, or holding back to unleash larger ones, and both have their place in different fights. Later on, your characters get more options, and have quite a massive list of skills, but all of them are usable in combat without completely overwriting others (older skills rank up as well as you go). In addition, instead of a straight 'defense reduces damage' system, your characters defense is a seperate HP bar. It is reduced when hit, sometimes leaking HP damage through, but a lot of the time if your defense is large enough, completely blocking an attack and just taking a defense hit. This plus the energy system allows for a rather varied combat game, as you use different skills for high or low defense enemies, and you have a bit of a barrier to losing HP to random encounters. As such, you can actually dungeon crawl for a while before having to rest and recover, and the battles always have a rythm to them. The lack of actual random encounters in all but a few areas means that you never get bogged down in the game.\n\nSo at the end of the day, it is a good game, but it is hampered by bugs and some annoyances. The designer still seems to be working on fixing them, but their existance is inexcusable in an otherwise well designed game. Pick it up if you like well designed combat systems, don't if bugs drive you up a wall or you need a good story.","April 19","true","95.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game has not been updated for over 6 months but still has outstanding issues (not to mention a lot of spelling mistakes)...\n\nYou explore dungeons in realtime while combat is turn-based with reasonable strategy (e.g. spell/skill choices, buffs and debuffs) and with a growing party of your summoned monsters. You can have up to three accompanying you at one time but those not accompanying you level with the party so you can try them if you struggle with certain enemies.\n\nI played on the hard difficulty and found the first part of the game very challenging as my party was low on magic and healing. The first boss took multiple attempts but after that hurdle you get optional dungeons that you can explore for gold (=gems), experience and magical items.\n\nThe game has buggy menus (e.g. they disappear and you need to reload an earlier save - has happened once but consistently on one save for me!), some of the sounds are repetitive and some of the levels have clipping oddities but nothing game breaking so far for me.","January 3","true","4.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I thought I'd write up a review of it.\n\nPros:\n* Old-school dungeon-crawl feel.\n* Nice art.\n* Neat little storyline.\n* Turn-based combat, which makes strategy easier.\n* Quite a bit of potential with skill training. Casters don't have to stay quite so "squishy," which has helped me in boss fights.\n\nCons:\n* Combat can be a little repetitive.\n* Minotaur minion seems a bit overpowered at the beginning, but he seems to balance out and be on par with other characters by around level 11.\n* Slight issue with the save function--it doesn't automatically update and show me my new save. I have to hit "back," and it shows me the new save for exactly one second, so it's hard to confirm if I've saved the game unless I watch it like a hawk.\n\n\nAdditional: This is not a complex game. Some people might see that as a negative thing, but in this case, simple is better. The precept of getting out of the dungeon is straightforward. I have a few slight complaints, namely that I would dearly like to see some sort of enemy status bar so I know what debuffs I have put on them, but ultimately, if you're looking for an old rpg dungeon crawl game, for $5, this one isn't too shabby, not too shabby at all. I'd recommend it. It's actually a pretty good deal for only $5.","February 12, 2014","true","15.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You play an evil sorcerer who gets trapped inside a book (hence the black and white look of the game). You have to travel from cell block to cell block defeating enemies and undoing the bindings from each area to ultimately escape. Helping you along the way are three creatures that you are given the choice of summoning, each with their own combat advantages and disadvantages.\n\nWhat holds this game back from being good are the bugs. Quest items and keys will vanish from your inventory upon reloading your game. Certain achievements are impossible to do as a result and consequently the whole game has a certain unfinished feel to it. There is no sound menu as of yet and the music in certain levels gets rather loud. All of this could be mostly due to the fact that it's just a one man dev team. Yup. One man. This is an impressive outing for one person to do. Honestly though, dev teams, even indie dev teams, need to be a tad larger to handle not only releasing, but updating a product to keep it bug free. That's where this game falters.\n\nI can't recommend this one right now. If the bugs get fixed then I might change my vote.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bropalm/recommended/263560/","bropalm","Bropalm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bropalm/","962 products in account","This game starts out pretty good, with an interesting artstyle and a fairly engaging combat system. But it's not as good as it seems.\n\nYou play as a sorcerer trapped in a magic prison in the form of a book (hence the artstyle). You goal is to make it through all 10 floors of the dungeon (each floor has 3 levels plus a boss). The first few levels look like generic dungeons, brick walled corridors and sparesely furnished side rooms. There is nothing particularly interesting, some bits of story, some buttons to press, some simple puzzles, some loot to pick up, and of course enemies to fight. You'd think they would change it up eventually but no, this is what every level looks like. There is zero variety, and it really feels like a slog after a while. Very far away from games with excellent dungeon design like Legend of Grimrock. Fortunately each level is small so it's pretty fast to get through, but what will take up most of your time is the battles.\n\nThe game uses a battle system that seems inspired by older JRPGs. It's a menu-based system where your group and one or more enemies take turns choosing attacks/actions. In the early stages of the game you get to pick from a list of characters to summon as permanent party members of your group. They all have different skills so there is a lot of customization there based on who you pick. You'll be able to get 5 in total but only 3 can be used at once (together with yourself) for a total of 4 party members. As you level up you unlock more skills/spells to use in combat, but you do not get to pick which ones, there is no skill tree or anything like that. Between levels there is a town area where you can visit a skill trainer which will let you upgrade your characters' various stats in exchange for money. It's all pretty standard.\n\nAt the start of a combat turn you pick all of your characters' actions, then both you and the enemies act, one after another in order of highest agility score. The order isn't made clear, and active status effects on you and enemies isn't obvious either, so it's often hard to plan ahead and really feel like you can properly use strategy. The result is that a lot of the time combat feels too random. There's no telling if an enemy will start with a powerful group attack that instantly almost kills your entire team (yes this happens), or if you'll be able to get off the correct buffs and attacks first.\n\nThe menu UI is slow and cumbersome to use, especially out of combat when you equip your party members and manage your items, and skills often come with only a vague description of what they do. I had one fairly high level spell with the description "deal damage based on the difference between current and maximum HP" and while using it somtimes it did some minor damage to the enemy, and other tiems it healed them! So I just ended up never using it.\n\nThen there's the loot system. It is very random. There are loads of items that only specific characters can use, characters that might not even be in your party, so there's no telling if you'll get unusable items, bad items, very good items or just gold or a potion. The result is that you can be very underequipped if you're unlucky, and equipment make a pretty big difference in this game. This might make you tempted to exploit the game, because if you save before opening a chest and you get an item you don't want, you can simply reload the game and try again for another random item.\n\nIn general the game gives you an unpolished and unfinished feel. There's plenty of bugs and glitches, spelling errors, unbalanced enemies and skills, a few unsolvable puzzles, and even several achievements that just won't unlock (including the ones you get for completing the game). The music feels out of place, it's not awful, but there's this weird constant crackle and you'll hear the same tunes throughout the entire game so in the end I just muted all sound and put on my own music.\n\nIn the end the game is mediocre at best. Decent artstyle but with no variety, forgettable story, boring dungeon design, unbalanced combat and loot system, and buggy. Only get this (at a 75% off sale) if you're a fan of this type of combat system.","October 25, 2015","false","22.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This keeps you from completing smaller puzzles soon after which, in turn prevents you from finishing the games biggest, and really, only side-quest.

Let me tell you about balancing, if you go up against a boss, the ideal situation is: He kills you once, then you know what you're up against and have a challenging and climactic fight. Games like dark souls, for instance, don't have to worry about that, since they're built to stop the player from progressing, rather than ease them on. But that justification doesnt apply to turn based rpgs. The balancing in this game is, and I'm sorry to say this, pitiful, while you'll likely go through an area without dying at all (albeit fighting some enemys with ridiculous health pools), you will not, I repeat WILL.NOT. be prepared for any of the bosses, excluding the first one. The four (presumably four, i haven't completed the game) bosses in this game aren't so much difficulty spikes as difficulty brick walls that can only be broken through by infinite revive items. I applaud it for expecting some level of rpg knowledge, you don't have a hope in hell for getting through the second area without a healer, for instance, but considering that, healer's dont help too much when faced with a giant with a massive f**k off sword that can bring down your entire group to half health in one move, then K.O one of them in another. What I'm saying is, the difficulty spikes in this game are pure industrially refined bull sh*t. *SPOILERS FOR THIRD BOSS* And that's not even mentioning the third boss, the customary "Uses stat alterations and minions" boss, but do you know why that kind of boss is customary? Because the minions in question usually don't do a wopping 70-100 damage in one hit, my tank minion had around 150 at that point, then there's taking into question that with one spell the boss can basically make every single move you use miss, and you sure as f**k aren't getting those debuffs down in time before the minions sweep you up like the underlevelled stain you resemble.\n\nAnd I say underlevelled, but as the trailer made a song and dance about, you cannot grind in this game. Now, rpg developers, I need you to listen to me for a minute, okay? Yeah, get real close, yeah just there, OK...GRINDING IS NECCESARY TO THE GAME. In most RPGs seeing bosses like this would immediately tell me that "Okay, im underlevelled, time to farm" and then I would probably quit and uninstall the game, but avid rpg players would go and farm that sh*t. What if I spent all my gems on revive items for the boss, then discovered my guys got killed too quickly to use them? What if i saved after buying them? I won't have the money to start training (which I assumed was just for people who didn't want to play the game like the manly man I am) and I also won't have anywhere to get more gems from because I've already cleared out all the levels. Basically, this game is a story of one f**k up and it's over, start again. Which is something I can admire from say, a roguelike, but not from a turn based rpg. On the same note, the paper-drawn art style was interesting to start with, and I'm fairly certain took a lot more effort than it would have taken to just use unity assets, but god does it make the environments boring after a while.\n\nBasically, paper sorcerer's balancing is sh*t on toast, and I couldn't care less if everything else was gleaming gold, if it isn't balanced, you're gonna have a bad time, it's got good ideas and an interesting concept, but the execution is pretty poor. I give this game a 5/10, just clinching the non-recommendation\n","August 22, 2015","false","7.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

As it began, I wasn't impressed, but after the first couple of fights, things started getting interesting. Eventually, I was having quite a bit of fun. The music is quite good, the "paper" appearance is pretty spiffy, and the fights were fairly strategic. Granted, I suck, so when I discovered that I could grind, I did for about half an hour before taking on the second big area. I felt guilty, like I had cheated a bit when I got to the second boss fight and I was taking hits to my entire party which dealt 50% or more damage to their HP. Despite having two healing characters, one of my healers was dead the next round, and my mage and warrior were dead within two more rounds. My final healer died swiftly after that. I had hoped to play a western RPG so that I wouldn't have to grind, because I want to experience progress moving through a game; not fighting the same crap for hours on end to get to see the next area, effectively making it easy for a developer to make less content but make it take longer to reach to conceal the fact that there is less content than in other titles, as with a Final Fantasy game or a free to play RPG. Perhaps a glorious strategist could do well in this game without grinding, but for me to succeed, I would have to grind for a very, very long time, and that's not entertainment; that's a job. I play games to have fun when I'm not working, and grinding is not fun. If you're quite good at turn-based strategy games or you love having to grind, this game is for you. Otherwise, I would recommend avoiding. I said it before, but great music and visual aesthetic, though...","May 16, 2015","false","3.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

I always loved high difficulty in rpgs, but I also loved the ability to grind for the absolute best gear and higher levels.  You can still make your way through the game on 1980's, but you'll always feel very weak.  Or you can turn the difficulty down, but then you'll feel strong for no reason.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/263560/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Paper Sorcerer is an old-school inspired dungeon-crawler RPG (In the same vein as Legend of Grimrock, although they're both very different games).\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots, it has a very unique art-style that draws you in, and while it has a couple of good ideas and its head on its shoulders, it's falls very short of expectations once you go deeper into it.\n\nYou're an evil sorcerer that was imprisioned in a book by the king. Once you're there, you'll gather allies and try to destroy the bindings of the book to free yourself.\n\nIn essence, the game is mostly about combat. You go through several floors on a dungeon (there are 10 in total, each with a Boss in the end)  to free yourself. You can "explore" each floor, but exploration is very limited, and mostly just there to break the monotony of combat.\nThere are also another 10 floors called the Catacombs, that serve more as a grinding place, and a SideQuest.\n\n\nLet's start with presentation.\nWhile the graphics' style is certain very unique, and I really liked it at the beginning, it barely every changes. Maybe a slighly different color scheme (between black/white and sepia), perhaps a different wall texture, but all in all, every floor looks very much alike, and it gets very repetitive later on, specially in a game that runs for about 15-20 hours.\nWhile in combat, you see the enemies' figure, but there's no animation in them. All you have is either particle effects for spells, or a simple swipe/throw animation for physical attacks.\nPersonally, I don't mind the simplicity of it, but one big issue I had with it is that, despite being very simple, it took a long time.\nThere's also a constant filter on the screen. To give it some texture. But it has no reason at all to be there. During the whole time, there's a translucid texture on your vision that makes no sense at all, and there's no option to disable it (unless it about turning the graphics down as a whole... only has Unity presets).\n\nTangentially, the interface was sluggish as well. Everything took more clicks than it should, and the text boxes jumped to different places for no reason, leading to more time looking for the right place with the mouse.\nFor example, with attacks in-combat: even if there only one enemy, is still has you selected the enemy you want to hit after choosing an attack. Unnecessary. If your character is either paralyzed or asleep, you only have one possible move. The game also has you have to select it anyway. Again, unnecessary.\nThese are mere examples, but it happens a lot in this game. Its interface is certainly not good, and that really detracts from the experience in a game like this that's almost exclusively about inventory/party/skills management. Everything takes way too long to do, really disliked it.\n\n\nHow's the music? Well, again, it missed its target. Sometimes the music felt like softer disco music. Some other times it felt more oldschool, other times more piano driven... very inconsistent. And for the most part, it didn't fit the game at all.\nAnd when the music is misplaced in a game, one tends to turn it off, right? Well, no sound options at all, so no deal. That's right. Either you mute the game, or you'll have to deal with it all. Not good at all...\nThe sound effects weren't all that great, but they do the job, I don't mind those at all.\nIt gets repetitive.\n\n\nThe story was told through books you found by exploring the floors. But each "book" gives you a very small passage of the story, and they're spread apart pretty far. Meaning that you'll not really keep the story in mind, unless you want to read all of the books in succession from your inventory. I don't think it was a very good way to conveying it, but hey, you can ignore it easily without affecting the experience.\n\n\n\nWell, let's get on with what really matters in this game: the combat. Despite all the sweet coating, this game is all about combat and party management/equipping.\nFirst off, and this is common practice, you pick your difficulty out of 4 (Easy, Normal, Hard and 1980s) before starting the game and I believe it's permanent. You'll also pick your team mates as you go, but also very early on (in the first 2 or 3 floors, basically). They make you make all these choices without letting you know how each one plays out. It's a shot in the dark. There's no adaptation period, no "extended" tutorial to let you try out the different classes... It's a shot in the dark. And I don't agree with it at all.\nWith the companions, they half overcome this problems. While you'll choose most of the members at the start, you'll have the ability of summoning others a few floors later, in the Catacombs. So, if you're not at all content with your party, you may be able to save the situation. But you may not. Each class has a short description, but it's not useful at all if you're not familiar with the mechanics, rendering it kinda pointless.\nYou can have 3 parterns at once (plus yourself, the Sorcerer), and have others as a backup plan, and maybe switch them up if needed (outside of combat). I had absolutely no need to switch them, but the option is there.\n\nI played on Hard Mode. While it was actually really hard for the first 3 floors (and required grinding in the Catacombs), it then became far easier after I rearranged my team, and found a viable strategy. Unfortunately, it takes a few hours for you to do so.\nAfter the third Boss, while it's still fairly challenging, that difficulty almost came to a halt, as the same strategy worked for literally every battle. The game became far too monotonous. The enemies became mostly upgrades of the previous ones, which meant that I didn't need to change my party or tactics to succeed, unfortunately.\n\nThe combat is typical RPG turn based. You have a basic attack, and you have skills. These skills can go from direct damage, damage over time, healing, improving X element of magic, increasing defense, control (like sleep, slow, paralyze) etc. It has lots of options, but it didn't seem to use them all very much.\nAs I said, the combat is very slow. And to aggravate this problem, late in the game, you'll fight several enemies at once, and they all have tons of HP. You'll be constantly fighting the same enemies over and over again, and each fights takes a long time, even if you're out of danger.\nAnd I mean a LONG time. It got infuriating in the late game. At the half-way mark, about 10 hours in, I was enjoying it. I overcame my difficulties, and was solidifying my strategy. After that, it was just the same over and over and over again. Same enemies, same strategy.\n\nThe mana system (Energy) in this game was quite cool. It was simplified, as you had far more limited amounts, but it would restore at a good rate, and you have to constantly managed how much a spell costs, or gives you, and try to keep constantly fighting. It really enjoyed this aspect!\n\nLet's talk about  encounters. Inconsistent, at best. It tries not to have random encounters, which is good! They place the enemies at certain points that you NEED to fight, but can prepare yourself. Great! Then, the catacombs have random encounters, and I saw it as a way to grind, if necessary. Even better! You only go there if you actually need to, so it's a good thing. But then, some of the main floors, seemingly at random, also have random encounters... It makes no sense to abandon previous design decisions for no reason! And it's infuriating to have random encounters appear out of nowhere! It destroys previously great design choices.\n\nThe puzzles followed the same inconsistency. First, they were all self contained in each floor. Great! Then, they start spreading through several floors with no previous indication...\n\nPaper Sorcerer could have been pretty good. But it's not consistent with its design, and gets too repetitive.

(I'm going to actually even add some to my music collection.) but it's just a little too cheaply made. For a game so simple, you'd expect it to be less buggy. But its not. It's got quite a few annoying glitches and bugs that I had to look up on how to fix.\n\nMost of the dungeons look exactly the same. completely empty hallways with doors that lead to more hallways or just the bed and shelf. The rpg aspect isn't bad, but it can also be lame. The first 4 party members you choose you can be stuck with for the whole game if you don't find secrets. I quickly found out that if I didn't find secrets, I was being MASSIVELY gimped to the point of enemies two shotting me. (yes I was playing on hard my first time, but once I found the secrets I breezed through and got new party members.)\n\nAll in all if you got the game for a dollar?

If you have a problem with what has been written, make a comment about it. **\nI find it absolutally hilarious that someone was so upset about this they downvoted all my other reviews. That's pathetic. This is a subjective review of a project. God forbid someone have their own opinion on the internet.\n\nPaper Sorcerer is a game in which we take on the role of a sorcerer who has been imprisoned in a book.\n\nThe soundtrack in Paper Sorcerer is made up of repeating the same short music blip over and over. There is an incredible lack of SFX and other gameplay audio. No Voice Acting, and repeating combat sounds really hold this game down. Audio- 2/5\n\nThis game features a beautifully unique art style, one that makes the world look very pleasing. This game contains well done textures and models- though in some aspects it seems as though the developers took the easy way out; such as blackness in place of shadows, or floating balls in place of enemy sprites. Nonetheless, the game is still very aestitically pleasing. 4/5\n\nThe story seems rather boring and underdeveloped. Nothing new or interesting. Standard "Escape the dungeon" story we have seen countless times before and no character choice or decisions to be made. Very bland. 1/5\n\nMechanically, this game suffers. The gameplay is simplistic, with little "customization" outside of changing a character's gear, or selecting new party members. We have no choice in our character's  traits or class. There is very little environment interaction aside from opening doors and enemies are painfully easy to evade as they are do not seem to move. It is possible to complete entire levels with no combat at all. Combat is quite frusterating; The energy/attack system is limiting, and the inability to gauge the status of enemies makes combat confusing. 3/5\n\nMajor issues that impacted the score- Stationary enemies, lack of character customization, generic story, frusterating combat system.\n\nFinal score- 10/20 or 50%   Buy at own risk","January 22, 2014","false","1.2"," 81 of 223 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","81","223","0","51"

The game was great and had some amazing little touches to it in the design of things.  The only thing I can say negative about it is that you cannot turn off the music (which gets old after some time because it is midi). The combat can be tricky and gathering your party to your design is fun and a challenge in itself.\n\n<IMPORTANT!> There is an early part in the game where you must choose whether to use a soul to summon one of your past minions OR use it for something "physical".  You only get this chance 1 time... so think about it before choosing.\n\nThere are nice puzzles and some very well implemented design to the them.  Not too tough but not frustrating or required to complete them to advance.\n\nParty variety is very unique but you cannot use all minions on a single play through. Reason to play again on a harder difficulty with different characters then  :)\n\nI definitely would LOVE a sequel to this which I hope would be much deeper on all aspects (and the ability to toggle of music )\n\nMaybe the next title will be "Paper Sorcerer: the Grimoire Temptress"  :)\n\nRegardless, if you like party based first person dungeon crawler games, this one is unique and well worth the inexpensive cost!","July 28, 2014","true","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is a gem for those who likes to find things on your own as there aren't much clues to be found.\n\nOh and don't try 1980's difficulty.","April 10, 2015","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game was great and had some amazing little touches to it in the design of things.  The only thing I can say negative about it is that you cannot turn off the music (which gets old after some time because it is midi). The combat can be tricky and gathering your party to your design is fun and a challenge in itself.\n\n<IMPORTANT!> There is an early part in the game where you must choose whether to use a soul to summon one of your past minions OR use it for something "physical".  You only get this chance 1 time... so think about it before choosing.\n\nThere are nice puzzles and some very well implemented design to the them.  Not too tough but not frustrating or required to complete them to advance.\n\nParty variety is very unique but you cannot use all minions on a single play through. Reason to play again on a harder difficulty with different characters then  :)\n\nI definitely would LOVE a sequel to this which I hope would be much deeper on all aspects (and the ability to toggle of music )\n\nMaybe the next title will be "Paper Sorcerer: the Grimoire Temptress"  :)\n\nRegardless, if you like party based first person dungeon crawler games, this one is unique and well worth the inexpensive cost!","July 28, 2014","true","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For the majority of the game the environments are the same, however this seemed to be much more of a design choice rather than a lack of innovation. The story is cleverly told with some elements humour that is both witty and well placed.The most stark flaw of this title is a bug on one of the final floors that blocks entry into a secret that had a considerable amount of multi-floor puzzle solving build up, that is yet to be patched. The party system does have a considerable amount of customizability, allowing the player to choose their followers, ranging from cultists to axe wielding minotaurs. There is enough loot in this game to sate the desire of any kleptomaniac as well as a shop with an unending supply of gems to your hoards to. The skill trainer introduces a degree of customizability in terms of combat traits to your followers outside of weaponry and armour but aside from this the role that each member will fill is predetermined. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Paper Sorcerer, on normal it is a good 13-15 hour experience, perhaps more on higher difficulties, however the bug on the higher levels (while not progression blocking in the story, blocks access to loot) certainly tarnishes its appeal; despite this the gameplay is fantastic and the story is well crafted possessing interesting plot points. Would certainly recommend this game.","July 10, 2014","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I took my time on normal difficulty, completed it in around 30 hours, died a few times, for a few bosses I had to adjust my party members (you have a pool of extra characeters). There's still replay value because I could try highest difficulty with a different party setup so there is a great amount of content for a casual game.\n\nStory: Loved it. Simple, easy to follow and get into, yet with interesting details along the way.\nI really felt like a paper sorcerer trapped in a book / digital world.\n\nMusic: Awesome. Electronics inspired by 80s dos sounds mixed with accoustics. Don't expect a medieval fanfare though, it's modern music, to me it fits the game and its inspirations perfectly adding a lot to the immersive factor.\n\nGraphics: Simple, original art style, fits with the whole game atmosphere very well. Beware however it is mostly black and white (some nice color effects here and there make it feel like alive ink art). Environments are extemely simple and repetitive . Not a lot of ennemy variety but interesting drawings...\n\nGameplay: it's mostly about long turn-based combats, which I love. Don't expect too much in term of exploration and puzzles, there's a few secrets to look for, some involve back tracking if you feel like it but it's all optional.\n\nControls: Average. With the mouse sometimes it feels like a tablet port. Controller support would have helped especially since this game would be easy to play simply with directions (cross or stick) + buttons for accept cancel and menu. However I was able to customize the controls in the main menu to my liking using mostly just a mouse with 5 buttons so it ended up OK for me.\n\nOverall: Great gem of a game, especially considering it was made mostly by one person. That person was able to express something with this game, I felt it and I greatly enjoyed the experience, very immersive (sometimes repetitive, just take a break when that happens!).","June 7, 2014","true","32.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Familiar with classic RPG games, or a sucker for the 8bit or 16bit games of old? Well then, give Paper Sorcerer a chance.\n\nEverything about Paper Sorcerer blends old-school RPG with modern touches, from the SID Chip C64 style music with a modern techno/dance thumping vibe, to the old-school RPG combat engaged through exploring a very 2D feeling 3D travel system.\n\nThe jarring visuals can be off-putting at first yet everything about this game grows on you if you give it a chance. I highly disliked the visual style just as much as I first loathed the music... But once I gave it a chance, its blatant merge of old and new grew on me, to the point of clocking up many hours (and would clock many more) as well as buying the soundtrack once I learned to appreciate what it was doing.\n\nMost importantly, if you're tactically minded and willing to stomach plain and simple RNG, then Paper Sorcer becomes that all important word - "Fun".\n\nSetup a party consisting of many different characters - Try to forge the perfect death-squad, gear them up, grow it and take down the game. Use your brain and plan your victory, because spamming auto-attacks or mindlessly using abilities won't get you anywhere.\n\nI've yet to re-play PS on Hard or even 1980's mode, yet I'm constantly tempted to try, simply because I enjoyed the game so much the first time.\n\nWell worth giving a go.","June 8, 2014","true","24.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style is exactly what it needs to be: simple, yet engaging. The combat is simplified but is reminiscent of just about all turn-based RPGs with a nice assortment of skills that doesn't get overwhelming. The music is appropriate for its setting and after a few turns of combat, I barely notice that it's there because it becomes ambient-I like that. It fills a void that other games just don't satisfy for me.\n\nIt can feel grindy to some, the combat can get particularly repetitive especially if turn-based combat isn't your thing. This is  what I would definitely consider a "casual" game, you're not going to find a lot of flashy environments, that said, however; at least it doesn't tax lower-end computers like mine. I can play it on the "fantastic" setting for graphics and there's no issue. There is really no options menu to speak of, you get a choice of three resolutions, the option of being in windowed or non-windowed mode, and the option to change the level of graphics. You can rebind controls as you will, and the game does offer information on it's in-game menu if you need some help deciding on which thralls to summon.\n\nIt doesn't exert any tactical thought, but that's part of its charm to me. It's a game I can just load up, sink an hour or two into, feel nostalgic, and then be satisfied. It never feels like "work" to me, but as mentioned, it can become grindy to anyone unfamiliar with the basic repetition of turn-based random encounters. All in all, a pleasant experience.","October 6, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was wrong, it's great. For $4.99 I'm seriously blown away with how much effort went into such a simple and minimalistic game. It's pretty much a modern old school RPG from simple combat to less-than-complex visuals and even dialogue that consists of mostly text describing things you can't see. True, there are a fair amount of glitches (visual and audio mostly, and rarely menus won't pop up), and the minimalist style can make dialogue and events a chore to sit through with no real visuals to back it up.

The game is old school like the old Might & Magic games whereby you create a party and kill enemies in dungeons, searching for loot at every corner. The visuals/graphics are montonous and the game doesn't rely upon too many assets so don't expect much variety from it - Especially if you look at the low price point. The gameplay however is addictive and if you're a fan of the genre, you won't regret your purchase.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/recommended/263560/","notsue","I'm Not Sue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/","465 products in account","This game is a pretty nice semi-traditional RPG with a good amount of thought put into it, whose only major flaw seemed to be a a few difficulty spikes / balance problems and a few bugs that actually just got fixed in a recent patch.  If you played the Shin Megami Tensei games, you may find some of the mechanics here very familiar and enjoyable.\n\nThe story of the game is strong enough that the premise and personality of the characters feels interesting.   Even if it doesn't get all that deep, it doesn't feel trivial or just there to hold the game together.  The black and white + paper aesthetic ties into this (you are trapped in a magical prison inside a book), but ultimately is just a nice aesthetic choice rather than being relevant to the gameplay at all.  The music is sort of an interesting mix of retro and electronic (but not chiptune) and seems to be disliked by quite a few others, but personally I enjoyed it.  The game performs and controls well at all points, although some menus become annoying to interact with if their contents become too long of a list.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are actually pretty interesting in how they both stick to and vary from normal RPG conventions.  MP recharges every turn and skills have independent cooldowns, thus letting you not feel like you have to conserve special attacks but also making it strategic to choose how to use it.  Status effects are applicable to almost all enemies and are actually useful to use in most encounters, as are stat-de/buff spells.  The game lets you build a party as you play the game and choose from a variety of tanks, healers, and both physical and magic dealing types, as well as specialize the main character partway through the game.  These characters can interact very well, with some setting up attacks for the other, drawing aggro, or blocking attacks along with the traditional buffing and healing.  Gear is fairly straightforward stat upgrades for the most part, and any excess money has a sink in useful stat upgrades.  Item drops are random and you can sometimes generate out-of-depth gear that carries you for several floors.  All enemy encounters are set except when specifically noted as random in a few specific areas.\n\nIf there are any complaints of the game, it is probably that there are strong difficulty spikes at the early part of the game (second or third boss IIRC) and the end of the game (Lv40 tier Assassin x2 + Sorcerer + Warrior mage encounter), and then later on seem surprisingly non-challenging.  I was able to pass these encounters without too much trouble even still.  There also aren't too many puzzles in the game, mostly a few perception based or riddle based puzzles.  A small complaint here is that a certain game-length chess key puzzle has the unfortunate quality of having your key break when used in the wrong lock.  All that really costs you is a reload and since you can have up to 10 saves it can mean a trivial amount of time lost, so I wonder why they didn't just say that the key doesn't work instead.  Also, said keys are removed from your inventory when successfully used, and all doors close and re-lock if locked upon reload.  Thus it is possible to accidentally shut yourself out of a chain of completed-puzzle-loot if you quit the game at a few awkward points, but you can't get yourself stuck as all such rooms can be opened by a level from the inside.\n\nOverall a really fun game, about 20 hours worth with a modest amount of replayability from trying the other party members you didn't play with or playing on a higher difficulty.  It gets a pretty solid recommendation from me!","May 17, 2015","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The dungeons you walk through are 3d, the battles 2d. The visuals are abstract/interesting, but not necessarily good. There's plenty of weapons and items and characters. It's a decent to good game. Not available on Linux, unfortunately. I liked playing it for a bit, but will likely not return to it.","December 27, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a neat rpg where you build up a team early on and see how you can do. It can be quite slow at times like the battles of the Pokemon Diamon and Pearl games (always wanted to use that analogy).\n\nIt has a nice art style to it. A simple color that makes it feel like paper as that name implies. It feels a bit bland though even as it hits the mark of the style it wanted.\n\nSound is great. The music and such sound nice but don't always fit the theme. I expected more mideval sounding music than the music you hear in the trailer. It is minor but I figured I'd talk about it.\n\nI would recommend this game at 33% off. But if you love RPG games you'll be fine with the price.","December 11, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was wrong, it's great. For $4.99 I'm seriously blown away with how much effort went into such a simple and minimalistic game. It's pretty much a modern old school RPG from simple combat to less-than-complex visuals and even dialogue that consists of mostly text describing things you can't see. True, there are a fair amount of glitches (visual and audio mostly, and rarely menus won't pop up), and the minimalist style can make dialogue and events a chore to sit through with no real visuals to back it up. But I was seriously entertained with this title despite these complaints. In my opinion, this game is easily worth Five bucks if you like old school RPGs.\n\nFetus of God/10 -Tom & Jerry","August 21, 2015","true","33.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
