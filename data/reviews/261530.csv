But in the end too many negative bits sucked the fun out of it for me. It just felt tedious towards the end. Here is what is good and bad.\n\nThe good:\nBeautiful Landscapes: You basically “run” (more on that later) through a series of truly well-drawn landscapes. The graphic textures are not always the greatest, but overall you get some stunning visuals. Especially the vertical elements can be quite remarkable.\nAtmospheric Sound/Music: Minimalistic, but appropriately used. Simply good.\nThe not-so good:\nSo… much… walking… : Unfortunately your movement speed is not very high. Which means that you transverse above mentioned landscapes step by step by step for what simply feels way too long. It certainly contributes to the atmosphere of solitude/lifelessness (because very little is happening while you walk). Just, that is not a very neat atmosphere to build up. The whole thing is compounded by the fact that:\nThe story does not move forward: Most of the time you are running somewhere you are doing so without much motivation, but simply because you are following the only viable way through this world. Not everything has to be open world, but at least give me a reason why I should now be traversing the lava level. God, I felt with my character when he character said “I demand answers! Now!” some hours in. Neither of us would get any for many more hours.\nUnmotivated Discontinuity: Sometimes a new level begins without any discernible transitions from the last. Example: Last minute it was daylight and you were standing on a cliff. Next second you are in a canyon and its night. Eh, what?\nPuzzles are way too easy: Most of the game you are following a giant “follow me” trail of glowing green, the only challenge being to keep your motivation for these long minutes. Puzzles are sparse (which in itself is a bit of a problem for a puzzle platformer), and never pose the slightest challenge. Like one-moveable-object-besides-one-landmark-easy: move object to landmark, done. When you get stuck, this it is very likely because you overlooked a required booster pack that is hidden a few hundred meters back. And who explores slightly off track at this walking speed?\nAbilities are arbitrarily removed: At some points you get a cool booster pack. Not only does it allow you to solve some platform puzzles, it also allows you to move quicker (yay!). Now you can spend an hour flying around with this thing in one level without a problem. But as soon as you cross a line the game declares it has run out of fuel (regardless of how long you have been using it). This is feels completely arbitrary. Similarly, sometimes the plot will decide you need more oxygen, regardless of when you refilled last or what you have been doing in the meantime.\nOverall, a tedious experience with some visisal perks. Did not go into the story becuase it might be subjective, but personally I am not blown away.","November 1, 2014","false","6.2"," 374 of 425 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","374","425","3","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexspeed/recommended/261530/","alexspeed","Alexspeed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexspeed/","6182 products in account","Lifeless Planet is a game well worth playing, surely one of the best Indie games I have played this year. It had a successful Kickstarter and passed through Greenlight to go to Early Access and to be released as completed game.\n\nIts made by Stage 2 Studios which consists mainly of David Board, and the game is the outcome of years of passionate hard work, while it utilized all the stages an Indie project can pass through, till its released on Steam.\n\nThis game is a unique work of art that inspires and entertains with its beautiful visuals and its story, unlike anything you can find in big budget titles. Words hardly can express the accomplishments this game reached. Its a Sci-Fi Story Adventure comparable to the books of Isaac Asimov or Games like The Dig.\n\nThe atmosphere is carrying this game. It makes you feel lost, helpless and afraid, even sad and isolated, but then again it evokes curiosity, hope and amazement. It has very little action but a lot of exploring and platforming and a bit of quite easy puzzling. Its pretty linear, but that's to be expected from a game that tries to tell a story I guess. There could be a bit more to do in some parts of the game.\n\nI will not reveal anything of the story, its yours to discover for yourself, because that's what the game is about. But I can assure you that it is very much worth it, if you have an open mind and search for something meaningful that you can enjoy without feeling pressured. It will take you around 5 hours for a playthrough. This is not a game for the impatient or simpleminded tough, those players will get bored or fail to grasp the storyline.\n\nIf there's one thought that I had while playing it, it was that the more you think you know about the world and the universe, the more you discover what you actually don’t know. The Storyline and ending is partly open to interpretation. Its not very strictly explained, which gives room for your own imagination. A freedom very few games ever trust the player with, and therefore it has to be complimented on such bravery.\n\nThe technical aspects of the game are robust for such a small team, reasonable performance, hardly any bugs, no crashes for me. I had to restart a level because something to advance the story didn't trigger first time, but that wasn't really a problem. Controls where fine for me with KB & Mouse, jumping around with the jetpack is a lot of fun. Gamepads are supported.\n\nThe graphical style is fitting for the game, although the way its done, also means that its looking pretty simple at times. Its definitely not a Crysis, but the aesthetics and level design make up a lot for it and make the game nonetheless a pleasure to explore and screenshot. It also has nice particle effects like dust, and the levels have a great variety of environments.\n\nThe musical score and sound is very good also, it really works well in combination with the storyline to emphasize important moments and add tension to the game. The voice acting is great, there are native Russian speakers who did the voiceovers and this makes this aspect really shine.\n\nIn conclusion I can say this game is well worth its price. The game has to be played and developers like these have to be supported. Buy and play this game, so we hopefully see more of this studio!","August 3, 2014","true","18.2"," 232 of 279 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","232","279","0","16"

The atmosphere in this game is simply amazing. I have to say this is one of the most atmospheric games I've ever played.\n\nYou feel pretty helpless all by yourself on this vast abandoned planet as you slowly uncover the story of this planet and it's inhabitants.\n\nThe music and voice acting is really good, nothing to complain here!\n\nThere are still some things annoying me. For example:\n\nI've got some FPS-drops sometimes and i run a GTX 680 and a i5 3570k + 12gb RAM... But the FPS drops won't make it unplayable but still it's a little bit annoying.\n\nAll in all this game is worth it's money (12.99€ for me [that was early access now it's 19.99€).\nI don't know how long it will take until you'll finish the game but for now it looks like you will spend a couple of hours with the game :)\n\n(Now I know :D it took me around 5 hours I think)\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nEDIT AFTER FINISHING THE WHOLE GAME:\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAfter finishing the game my opinion about this game did not change :)\n\nI will add some pro's and con's about this game:\n\nPRO:\n\n- breathtaking atmosphere (in my opinion)\n\n- really interesting story which makes you wanna play more and more :)\n(finished the game in one day because i couldn't stop playing)\n\n- easy controls (it's a simple jump n' run)\n\n- pretty graphics (not the best but they're okay)\n\n- many different terrains/locations (desert/ice/vulcanic/etc...)\n\n- AWESOME music, this is a huge plus\n\n- good voice acting\n\n- huge areas which have a beautiful view\n\n\nCON:\n\n- the gameplay itself can be a little bit boring, the puzzles aren't that hard and the rest is\nsimple jump n' run gameplay\n\n- it's rather short (finished it in one day in ~5h)\n\n- the graphics are okay but some textures are really "wishy-washy" :)\n\n- a few times i did not know what i need to do, so i needed to check out some youtube videos\n(but that could also be my own stupidity)\n\n- not very good optimized i had some fps drops while playing (~15FPS) even though i have\npretty good specs\n\n\n\nBut still I can recommend this game A LOT. Especially because of the awesome music, the great atmosphere and the really thrilling story which won't let you stop playing the game :)","March 6, 2014","true","6.6"," 382 of 505 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","382","505","0","27"

It isn't worth $19.99\nI wouldn't pay more that $5 for it\n\n\nAbstract:\nThe best way to describe why this game doesn't work would be to call it a "sightseeing" game. Large enviroments provide beautiful vistas, but traversing them, slowly, without any purpose other than to get from A to B makes poor gameplay.\n\nSynopsis:\n\nLifeless Planet's striking visuals, score, and intruiging plot are frustrated by ineffective controls, puzzles of arbitrary difficult, and at times, a lack of any direction whatsoever. Problems that wouldn't be terrible on their own, or in an actual exploration game.\n\nUnfortunetly, this game isn't an exploration game. In fact, it isn't anything it wants to be. The player onto the rails with lethal force. It wants to be story driven, but the story is could fit on a single page of paper. It wants to be a mystery, but the biggest mystery, (that of why the planet is lifeless, and where the Russian town came from,) are both answered early on. It doesn't want to be a platformer, but at times, that is the central feature.\n\nUltimately, once the player gets the hang of the controls, the story, and the repetative puzzles, the game simply seems ot drag on toward its conclusion... forever. This is the major weakness of this game: Length. There are other problems to be sure, bad controls, unforgiving puzzles and challenges. But the length its most agregious offence. There is less story here than Portal, but the game takes about twice as long to complete. Even at only 6 hours it's too long. If the enviroments had been shrunk to a less scenic size, the gameplay might have been rewarding.\n\nInstead, The controls are unforgiving. Walking around feels more like drving a small vehicle. At least onc death was caused by an inability of the main character to turn around in place. Nailing jumps can be difficult when distances become difficult to gauge.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe story is, surprisingly compelling, if lacking in depth. The puzzles simple. The controls are frustrating in that they seem more often like death is caused by the game being unforgiving than player error.\nIts best comparison would be a classic Sci-Fi short story. Like an episode of the Twilight Zone. If the game had fit into a 1-hour television block, it would have been great.\nOn the other hand, strictly speaking, I'm not disapointed I played it. I like those old episodes of the Twilight Zone.","March 20, 2015","false","5.7"," 143 of 184 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","143","184","3","0"

The story is pretty interesting, and really this should've maybe been a book instead of a game, because the gameplay just doesn't hold my interest.\n\nIt's a lot of really slow running through environments solving extremely basic puzzles like "put the X in the X" and jumping from platform to platform.\n\nThe music is nice, but I didn't find it to be deeply immersive like many reviewers seem to. The player character responds to the controls in a very jerky way and interesting moments are always going into cutscenes and doing other jarring things that really take you out of the experience.\n\nIf you're super bored or super high this might still be a worthwhile play for you, but if you're like me you'll find yourself just running through a lot of "this path only" monotony hoping to find another shred of plot .","June 7, 2014","false","3.6"," 315 of 438 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","315","438","0","5"

You play as an American astronaut that is sent to explore a planet that your readings suggest is brimming with life. Upon arrival you find that this planet is nothing like you expected. It houses strange secrets of past explorers and a nation trying to find the perfect life away from Earth only to find that meddling with things they don't understand almost never ends happily. An interesting mix of casual exploration and platforming, it keeps things relatively fresh most of the time. You should feel the want to get to the end to see how everything pans out and what the mysteries of this Lifeless Planet are, but at the same time your feeling of eerie isolation and the ambient sounds of the world make you want to take your time looking at the planet and chilling out as well. I became lost in the isolationist atmosphere and didn't want it to end.\n\nIf you peer at the store page for this game and look at the user tags you would think that this is a game in the same genre as Dear Esther and the other "walking simulator" sorts of games. In some instances this is accurate, but in Lifeless Planet you have more than just your feet to work with. You are in a space suit with a jetpack! So while this game is semi-casual most of the time, there are a fair amount of platforming situations in which you must use the jetpack to make some pretty intense jumps now and then. I wouldn't say that this is extremely difficult to do, but you don't just walk from point to point here like a "walking simulator" would suggest. Not only that, but there are puzzles that you will come into contact with that force you to ponder the environment a bit as well as some technology to help you solve these puzzles. So it definitely delves into much more gameplay than just walking from story point to story point.\n\nBesides the tags being somewhat misleading, that META Score is completely off base in my opinion. Lifeless Planet is a fantastic game with a fantastic atmosphere, a cornucopia of map changes that will give you an explosion of color in some areas that is intensified by the more “Lifeless” areas you will find. The game has about 20 different areas with about 15 of them feeling like something completely different from the rest. Each area can be blown through in 10-15 minutes if you want to unless there are puzzles to get through, but anyone that enjoys looking at scenery and taking their time to explore game worlds should find more joy. (While discussing the want for even more little discoveries outside collectibles like random gravestones and such to add to the flavor of the world on the forums the developer said that they will be adding in more of this in a future patch.) It is not open world, but the areas feel wide and spacious enough that you will be able to wander a bit. Not to mention that there are some collectible items such as minerals and documents found in the game to give you a reason to check some of the back corners. Documents, which add a great deal of the story aspects to the game tend to be on the main path, however so you shouldn't miss any of these.\n\nThe soundtrack is used sparingly, but feels like when the music comes into play it is escalating the situation and your feeling of isolation and the importance of where you are. It creeps into the feeling of the game and gives you the impression that it is pushing you towards an important moment when it begins to quietly chime in as you move forward. Most of the time, however the isolation you feel is intensified by the ambient sounds of a barren world. Winds and other strange sounds like rocks falling while looking into a great chasm add to the effects of your play.\n\nThe story is mysterious, creepy, and interesting. While the main protagonist is your view into Lifeless Planet, you can hear the echos of others throughout your exploration in documents. Some documents contain a sound file in which you can read along as a Russian speaker transcribes it in their own language. It is a Russian speaking voice from someone native to the language as well so it feels authentic. Based solely on the game's title graphic, it is obvious that there is a Russian aspect to the game, but a Russian aspect from the Soviet Union of old. While you are an astronaut from the United States, and there is a Soviet Union background within the game, it does not delve into politics of any sort, nor does it make any statements about either of these nations, or any conflict they had other than maybe a passing note here, or there if necessary to understand the story within the game. The story is one of DISCOVERY, and what it would be like for someone to travel many light years away from Earth and to explore a new world. Their excitement with seeing new forms of life, as well as their struggles with dealing with the unknown.\n\nThe best part of the story to me, however is your own discovery of something else being there, and your interactions with it throughout the game. Very little communication is had as you feel it out and it brings an aspect of humanity to the game that is wonderfully done I feel. Without talking, or actively communicating you do feel a sense of closeness to something while making your way to the end. It is too spoilerish to discuss it really, but it is something I feel should be mentioned because the impression you will get mostly looking at this game is that you are fighting the planet and the story is just one of looking at the past more than anything else. This is a major part, but there is the sci-aspect that all good sci-fi stories have in which humanity and human experience comes into play.\n\nGraphically the game is solid and gives you a great many screenshot opportunities. The game uses a bit of a filter on it that you would see if you were on such a place to blur it up some, but it is clear for the most part. On the outside of the FOV you will see blurring on the edges, however. Even on fantastic the game looks very good, but it is definitely not a AAA title quality level of HD graphics. For an Indie title they are great though and they fit the game perfectly.\n\nGamepad support is good and is preferable to me while playing the game. I used a PS3 gamepad with Xbox 360 plugins and it worked fine the entire game.\n\nThe game is predominantly bug free from my playthrough except there seems to be a bug with an Achievement that the developer has said will be addressed in a patch coming soon. There is an Achievement in which you must collect all documents in game, but as of now it seems the few of us that have looked for this final document to unlock the achievement cannot find it. The document is known to exist from the game files, but does not appear to be in the game anywhere. The developer is quite active on the forums and said they will fix this soon so there should be no worries here.\n\nTL;DR/BOTTOM LINE: Lifeless Planet is a great game that will appeal more to a casual gamer from a gameplay standpoint, but to a wider audience of gamers who like sci-fi mysteries, exploring new worlds, and feeling the isolation of a lost planet. The developer, David Board and his team should be proud of their work and congratulate themselves on an epic and unique game. I loved it all the way through and plan to play it again. There is an Achievement to beat the game in under 4 hours, so it could be completed in under that time, however it would be a complete waste to blow through it that quickly. It took me close to 10 hours to finish the game taking my sweet time. There is an Achievement for playing 10+ hours in one game as well too, and I got that without actually having to just idle the game so it is possible to spend over 10 hours in it easily.\n\n9/10 Space Suits","October 20, 2014","true","21.8"," 111 of 142 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","111","142","4","11"

Seriously, the game did not make the impression to be a platformer. How could the players of the early access version be satisfied with what they got? Even as a platformer, this game is underwhelming and I payed 20 euro for this. Aaargh. I thought I would get my personal game of the year but I got my personal embarassment of the year.\n\nThis game seemed to have so much potential, but when I arrived at the soviet village at the beginning it started to dawn on me that something went wrong. The village was deserted, ok. But there was nothing else to do than finding one of my crewmen and searching for oxygen (last of which occured now and then later on). And of course the "puzzle" here consisted of jumping around to find parts of a code... really, how boring with 10 'o's.\n\nIn general, all puzzles are not challenging as well as most of the jumping parts. There is a barrier on my way? Oh, how nice that someone forgot some dynamite some meters away... that's one example how dull the puzzles are and they did not become more complex which I hoped.\n\nThe story and the atmosphere are both good. But even story and atmosphere are destroyed many times. Again, in the soviet village, there was nothing really to explore. Sometimes there are personal logs or that of the villagers, but they don't transport the story really well. There are some occurences that give the hero a deeper character (remembering his wife's disappearence on earth). Still, it's not enough. The hero's character keeps to be very shallow. If the gameplay is so dull and linear at least the atmosphere should suck me in. But f.e. I could not enter any of the soviet village's houses to find out the personal tragedies of the persons that lived there.\n\nImagine what could have been done:\n- photos and other personal belongings of the former inhabitants\n- f.e. finding the soviet book at the beginning of the village, reading in it, finding hints about how to activate a scientific machine to examine probes of the plant life\n- the game is not so linear, the world gives more space for exploration with the danger to get lost in the desert. By carefully examining an reading logs of the people you find out how to locate the next colony or the power plant structures...\n\nSo many possibilities. I hoped this game would at least partially follow the spirit of Arthur C. Clarkes "Rama" novels or those of the Strugatzki brothers.

It's mostly a platformer, with a couple puzzles, and a lot of walking as you explore.  It's pretty linear--you cannot get off the track too far.  What made me quit playing is the awful "save" function.  The game does not actually save when you want it to.  If you are in the middle of a level and fall to your death, you spawn petty close to where you fell, and this is great!  But if you save and quit before finishing the level, you have to start the level over again from the start of the level (not where you "saved").  You cannot leave the game until you finish the level you are on, or you have to replay 10 or 20 minutes of the game as you restart the level  (I'm slow, I guess).  There was one level I found a bit tough, and I became discouraged because I could not leave the game until I succeeded with this level.  I  got to the LAST jump, failed over and over and set the game aside.  But next time, I start the level over from the beginning.  After I did this five or six times, I put the game aside and never finished it.  If you like platformers, this game may be for you...\nEdit:  I gave this game a "thumbs down", do not recommend.

It's part walking simulator, part platformer, part puzzle game, with an overarching strong story focus. You're an astronaut sent on a mission to explore a lush planet but end up on a deserted wasteland. Questions like "What happened to the planet?" soon meld into questions like "Did something happen to me?" when all kinds of weirdness starts popping up.\n\nElaborating further would steer the review into spoiler territory, so I won't go there. But unfortunately I have to report that while I make the game sound very mysterious (and it certainly is that, up to a point), the final answers provided do not end up being nearly as satisfying as I would've initially hoped they'd be. There is some neat psychological ambiguity lightly sprinked around, but most of the story is rather standard sci-fi fare.\n\nWhile you wait for the game to reveal its next story nugget, you'll traverse through some pretty arid environments and do a lot of jumping. And I do really mean a LOT of jumping. Most of the actual gameplay in Endless Planet consists of jumping and platforming, and it ends up being more of a nuisance than interesting or rewarding in any way. I feel like majority of the bouncing around could be replaced with just bog-standard walking sections, and the game would work a lot better. A few simple puzzles also felt a bit hastily thrown together.\n\nLifeless Planet is heavily banking on the player finding its story worthwhile, but at least for me, it just didn't hit home at all. The most interesting facets of the story are hardly explored at all, and the least interesting ones are shoved into the limelight and paraded around. I just can't root for this one.","October 21, 2014","false","4.0"," 56 of 81 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","56","81","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/261530/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","Lifeless Planet is the sort of game that is the reason why I don't start writing recommendations for games until I've completed them. If I had written my review after only playing the first hour of the game it would've certainly been a positive, but after playing the rest I just can't bring myself to do it.\n\nBefore I get into why this is the case, I feel it's important to actually tell what the gameplay is like, because the store page doesn't really do it justice. It sort of vaguely makes it out to be an adventure or exploration game, but what Lifeless Planet really is is a fairly linear platformer. That isn't inherently a bad thing, and at the beginning of the game it works fine, only occasionally marred by poorly placed jumps where you have to choose between jumping without using the jetboost and not jumping far enough or jumping with the jetboost and soaring past the platform because of the awkward placement in relation to the planet's gravity. But later on in the game they seem to decide that exploring a Mars-like planet with desolated Soviet architecture with audiologs explaining the history isn't interesting enough, and so for about the last 1/3 of the game it spirals into a nightmare of pitch black darkness where you just fumble around until something impales you and you start over turned around facing the wrong direction at the checkpoint to make you even more lost, or randomly guessing which direction you can move in that won't instantly incinerate you. There's a very good reason why these levels are only shown once in the store page's screenshots.\n\nThe story suffers the same fate, unfortunately. What begins as an interesting story of a doomed planet and a failed Soviet experiment suddenly devolves into a mess of nothing, with ideas like the protagonist's wife or a woman potentially being the planet's cure being tossed around and randomly introduced at moments that seem important enough that you think they might actually drive the plot along only to be immediately forgotten about a few seconds later. It feels like they had a bundle of ideas for stories from multiple people on the development team but none of them could decide which to include, so it just starts five stories and doesn't adequately end any of them.\n\nUltimately, it's just hard to recommend this game. Even though it's only six hours on Earth, on the Lifeless Planet it feels like at least double that because of how tedious the platforming gets in the darker levels. The graphics have improved enough in the Premier Edition that the game looks nice when you can actually see it, but there are still some noticeably bad models even in extremely prominent places like the model of Aelita, the only other character in the game. The game occasionally toys with the idea of being a survival game, with multiple points in the game featuring the player running low on oxygen at scripted points and having to traverse to an oxygen refill station, but it never really does anything with it. The whole game left me feeling like I would've been having a lot more fun if they had just dropped me off back at the opening Soviet station and let me explore and try to find a way to survive on the planet while exploring and reading the backstory logs, instead of actually slogging through the mess of a campaign that's there instead. You could maybe have a good time just replaying the first few hours over and over and restarting when you reach the first night segment, but otherwise Lifeless Planet is just a hollow disappointment.","March 20","false","5.8"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","22","26","2","0"

I wish I had just waited and watched the full let’s play to satisfy my curiosity. The trailer is a fantastic teaser for a game that drops dead as soon as first early access chapter is finished.\n\nThis game is DULL. It peaks early with the abandoned town and then it slowly drains all the wonder and drive out of the story with predictable platforming, boring action and empty character interactions. Oxygen is a joke, you are told that you have 8 hours oxygen upon filling up at a tank but I’m certain that you could leave the game running for days and it would not run out. But it just so happens that It immediately *runs out* as soon as you are within sight of a refuel point. This along with the temporary jetpack fuel powerups, that also immediately run out once you have completed the soul sucking large jumping sections only add to the predictability of this game.

Don’t worry I’m sure there is a perfectly rounded rock nearby that will be happy to help.\n\nAfter 2 hours I didn’t care about finding out what fantastic twist awaited me at the end as from what I could make out it was just going to be a disappointing as the journey.\n\nThis game will suck a lot of people in with a great trailer and an even better early access teaser, I recommend you give it a miss and satisfy your curiosity by just watching a let’s play instead.\n\nEdit* I've just realized how ironic the name of this game truly is\nEdit* Ha had a total brainfart with the use of ironic above","June 6, 2014","false","1.8"," 177 of 299 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","177","299","0","8"

Now I don't enjoy walking simulators and I'm unsure if this is one or not.  It does involve quite a bit of walking, but also a generous amount of jumping, jet-packing and puzzle-solving.  I'd say it is as much a 3D platformer as a walking simulator.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/35jBWITXsWA\n\nI found the jet-packing segments to be the most fun.  Our hero doesn't always have access to the full abilities of his jet-pack due to a lack of fuel.  The fuel is storyboarded to run out at certain sections of the game, it's not some resource that you can carefully manage to make other parts of the game easier.  It's designed so you can jump higher and further on the platform-type parts of the game and afterwards it becomes depleted.\n\nThe puzzle difficulty isn't too perplexing.  The couple of puzzles that had me stuck meant that I just needed to explore the area a bit further until I found an item or a switch that created part of the solution.\n\nDue to the game not having a great difficulty level it's a fairly relaxing affair, I found myself playing the game last thing at night to unwind a little.  There's a great atmosphere in the game backed up with some really nice ambient sound effects that demand the volume be dialled up a notch or two.\n\nThe graphics are pretty nice looking with the exception that a lot of the textures for the surroundings are fairly low-res.  This becomes apparent when the camera is close up to them, from afar the world looks quite impressive.  The hero is really nicely detailed, especially the reflection from the visor on his space helmet.\n\nIt took me about seven hours to complete the game at a leisurely pace.  I found myself picking it up and playing it for about an hour at a time.  The game holds a couple of achievements that increase the replayabity somewhat.  One is to complete the game under four hours and the other is to complete the game without dying.  I'll probably attempt these soon.

On arrival, you discover you are alone, isolated on a planet seemingly devoid of life, yet strangely there is a Soviet town abandoned long ago. How can this be & what has happened here? As the story unfolds, & you explore more of this intriguing alien world, you soon realise there is a much more going on than meets the eye. The planet is not as lifeless as it seems...\n\nThe sense of exploration, uniqueness in the alien world along with the snippets of story that you unlock through your progression was most enjoyable & kept me wanting to progress to reveal more.\n\nSound effects & musical score were also strong, & graphically there is also a cool film grain effect & blurring of the edges of the screen that add greatly to the experience. Would have been epic in first-person view to really enhance the claustrophobic feel of being stuck in the space suit on an alien world.\n\nFor those who love their Sci-fi movies, you will also come across many scenes throughout that feel somewhat familar (in a good way), yet meld together well. Futuristic yet retro, reminding you of old classic 50-60s B-Grade Sci-Fi, cold war era themes & some modern storytelling elements.\n\nWhen looking past these positives there are some parts of the game that I found lacking from making this a really excellent game. The controls for one, although basic & suitable for the layback style of gameplay are awkward. It is easy to mis-jump, your jetpack is limited in function (essentially only providing a double-jump type mechanic to traverse larger areas) & the puzzle elements feel somewhat clunky & difficult to complete. Even though the puzzles themselves are rather simple. It also didn't help things when you respawn (this will happen a lot!) facing the wrong direction all the time is very disorienting.\n\nDark, creepy sections that occur in several stages are way too dark, with only a tickbox option to lighten the scene in menus. You have a flashlight, but does little which is most frustrating at times. It really needs a gamma or brightness slider.\n\nThere are also the 'emersion breaking' elements, such as there always being an oxygen tank just when you need it, or dynamite just near where you need to blow your way through a blocked path or a nice round rock (unlike anything else in the surrounding enviroment) just at the right spot to jump to a higher platform. It seemed to lack some creativity in level design in this regards when elements like this are introduced essentially just for the sake of it.\n\nMost cut-scenes are limited being less than 30secs with most of the story elements experienced through translated logs found. This felt like a bit of a missed opportunity to really expand on the adventure; still good overall (& I am being picky to a degree) but could have been exceptional if the story continued as strongly as it began!\n\nSome later sections of the game feel padded out, with no real content or interesting things to see, just more running & jumping. Other parts are really awe-inspiring so it quite a mix. Some of the final levels just seem to go on & on without any purpose other than to lengthen the game. The experience would have more impact if the overall length was reduced by maybe 30% or so in my view. While shortening some areas, some larger cut-scenes & more back story to your character (only touched on for most of the game) would have been great!\n\nAlthough not quite as good as my expectations coming into Lifeless Planet, I still thoroughly enjoyed the story, the implications of the story (not to give anything away) & the final reveal. It was an interesting conclusion. Overall a fun & occasionally disturbing experience!\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","August 13, 2014","true","14.3"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","22","28","0","8"

Unfortunately, as they almost always do in games, something goes wrong. The ship crash lands. The themes brought up throughout the game, some subtle, some not so much, are widespread and generally effective. Our space-faring scientist has to deal with loss, loneliness, self doubt, the prime directive, and more.Something immediately noticeable about Lifeless Planet is that it has fantastically rich and convincing atmosphere. While the graphics leave something to be desired from a purely technical standpoint, the visual and aural direction really sell the whole thing. Some of the alien vistas are truly beautiful, and walking around the seemingly endless barren deserts feels as isolated and alone as being on the other side of space should.Unfortunately Lifeless Planet doesn't make exploring as rewarding as it should be. The game offers a lot of nooks and crannies for the player to poke into, but very few actually offer anything interesting. They tend to be empty corners, without any remarkable features at all. The game also has very few collectibles; just a handful of geological samples and scientific notes.With no combat to control the game's pulse, Board opts for a mixture of ambient storytelling, platforming and physics puzzles.Most of the platforming isn’t difficult because of complex timing or dangerous obstacles, it’s difficult because the controls were meant to act like a guy in space. Lifeless Planet is a really fun experience, but not a very good game. I’d still recommend it based on the entertainment I got from exploring the mysteries of the game’s world, but I wish I didn’t have to deal with questionable puzzles and mechanics to do so. I think it is unique enough to be worth its asking price for those that are fans of the genre though.

So I buyed a bunch of early access games, because I had a really boring time. From all the games I played through I liked Lifeless Planet the most. This game has sooo much potential to become a really, really good game. The following list is a pro/con list that refelcts my opinion about the game so far:\n\nPros:\n-On highest graphics the game looks so awesome, its like watching a movie at some parts.

Of course it's not really lifeless, because there's the whole soviet village thing. The first several areas are really pretty dull (baren, lifeless planet), but things do start to get more mysterious. Unfortunatly, my interest in the plot died about as quickly as the Russian colonists. Lifeless Planet quickly becomes Follow-the-Radioactive-Soviet-Pixie-Dust Simulator as you track the trail across a seemingly enless expanse. The voiced plot-points are predicible and the collectable documents read like a bad 70's alien invasion/Cold War crossover movie.\n\nI probably would not have noticed/cared about the weak story if the other parts of the game were better than they are. Aside from a noticible smattering of death-related glitches, there are a number of game mechanics that don't work well of don't make sense. Calling them out may seem nit-picky, but by their powers combined, they really detract from the quality of the game:\n-When transitioning into a new scene that should be geographically adjacent to the previous scene, the scenary changes as if you traveled a distance between scenes with no apparent explaination\n-A burst from your jetpack at the right time can save you from hitting the ground too hard... unless of course you're falling into the valley that isn't part of the trail you're supposed to follow, in which case you die before you hit the ground to prevent you from going out of bounds\n-The character is capable of pushing around boulders that are as tall as he is, but requires three sticks of dynamite to clear a blockade consisting of a couple of packing pallets and a barrel\n-You can only deply the robotic arm in very specific situations (i.e. puzzles)\n\nThe only thing that I actually like about Lifelss Planet is the robotic arm. The specialized GUI is the envy of my inner Kerbal cargo engineer.\n\nIn conclusion: if you're looking for graphically appealing exploration/mysterious story walking simulator, I strongly reccomend Dear Ester. If you're looking for a retro sci-fi mystery/adventure, read Space Cadet by Robot Heinlien. If you need an example of a game that was good in theory but was poorly executed, add Lifeless Planet to your list of references.\n\n\nFun: 4/10\nChallenge: 6/10\nBang for your buck: 4/10\nOverall: 3/10","August 10, 2014","false","3.5"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","1"

The love and care of a single man is shown in beautiful atmospheric music and, occasionally, the environments. However, this isn't enough to carry the whole game.\n\nPROS:\n- As I mentioned, GREAT music and occasionally magnificent environments\n- Draws you in\n- Interesting story\n- Enemies are awesome\n\nCONS:\n- The jump and the fact that the game is built around it\n- Put the rock in the hole puzzles\n- Very noticeable changes in quality\n- Poor pacing\n\nLifeless Planet's first hour drew me in; I wanted to find out more about the mystery. I was genuinely curious. But as the game continued, bits of story were more and more sparse and rapidly decreasing in cohesiveness. By the end, I found the story component of the game intriguing but not quite satisfying.\n\nMy first impression of the graphics were that they were pretty mediocre; in fact, I even thought the game looked pretty ugly in one of the first few environments, approximately an hour in. Then, suddenly, the next level was gorgeous, colour-rich, and stunning to look at. Unfortunately, the game kept going back and forth between beautiful and meh scenery. While the music really helped me enjoy the game, the change in quality sometimes broke the immersion.\n\nBut man, were the enemies cool. I loved them. I won't give anything away, but if you're into interesting enemy design, you'd probably like this game.\n\nMy least favourite part of this game was the jump (as well as the mechanical arm, but that part felt rushed and rather dumb). The jump was SO annoying that I became increasingly frustated with the mechanics of crossing a simple path. Some environments paired with the jump simply did not work, and it was infuriating just how simple the platforming I was screwing up was.\n\nEven the extended jet-pack time mechanic, by far the most fun thing in the game, kept being taken away at convenient times after I'd stopped needing it; same with the threat of running out of air. It doesn't seem real, but like it's an in-game scenario. The puzzles were occasionally interesting, but were basically never challenging, which saddened me. Some moments in this game were really cool, but it feels like a mixed bag.\n\nIn the end, I liked this game somewhat. The story definitely had some interesting parts, and I was invested enough to want to battle the jump out to the end. I'm not completely satisfied, but I am hopeful for what the creator could make with more money and resources.","May 19","false","6.1"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

But my least favorite part of the game was how lifeless all the environments were. I mean it’s called Lifeless Planet but come on, make it somewhat interesting. The environments were so bare they felt more like rooms to hold ♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzles than places to explore. And each level felt like the last just with a different color filter. I also felt like the story was poorly tied together.

Your objective, as a lone surviving astronaut that spent 15 years journeying to the now desolate heavenly body, is to discover what caused the mass extinction of life. You will discover this information not only through story progression, but also through collecting and reading documents along the way.\n\nThe game itself uses the Unity engine, so it should be unsurprising when I say that Lifeless Planet suffers from random frame drops in random areas. Aside from this minor technical issue, the only other complaint about the performance of the game is the loose controls when using the jet pack while jumping. You can overshoot or undershoot your target very easily, and trying to turn around when you overshoot your mark is nearly impossible. Sometimes the jumps are committed to the direction that you initially jump in, and other times they are not; it's a very touch-and-go mechanic that causes some platforming sections to be frustrating.\n\nThe story line itself is decent, although it's not entirely what I personally expected when I researched the store page and trailers. Given that the name of the game is indeed Lifeless Planet, it's a surprise when you find out that you are not exactly alone. I find that this detracts from the mystery and eeriness of the game itself. Being alone on a foreign planet that is completely devoid of life is a frightening thought, but without the additional party that you encounter on the adventure, the ending would not be possible.\n\nWhen it comes to the musical score, Lifeless Planet does well. There are a large variety of tracks and subtle ambiances that play during well timed moments, either spiking the fear and anxiety of the player, or soothing them on their long odyssey. However, I did find that the music does abruptly end at some points, and I am unsure if this is due to an in-game trigger when hitting certain areas or just a typical Unity malfunction.\n\nLifeless Planet can be easily beaten in under four hours, even during the first play through. The puzzles are easy, it's rare that you will not know where to go next, and there is little replayability aside from achievement collecting. That being said, I find the asking price of $21.99 CAD to be very steep for this title that most people will only play through once. On sale, or in a bundle, I can recommend Lifeless Planet. It's a decent little game with an alright story line, just don't go in expecting too much.

Having said that, though, I do not recommend it (read on to find out way).  You spend most of your time exploring the world, occasionally jumping across gaps or pushing rocks but mostly just walking around. The few puzzles really aren't anything extraordinary and the solutions to all of them are immediately obvious. The real enjoyment comes from exploring the vast and impressive environments and finding clues about what happened to this world and the Russians who first settled it. The story is definitely intriguing and kept me entertained the entire way through the game, which is good, because the exploration part unfortunately becomes quite boring by the end of the game.  The first two hours are fantastic!  The last two to three hours, are mediocre and bland.\n\nEarly on there are rock specimens, scientist logs, and intractable locations all over the place, but by the end of the game, there's pretty much nothing hidden for you to find. I feel the designer, by placing these items throughout the early levels, deliberately designed the game to make you waste time looking for something when there is nothing to be found. Either that or he just ran out of ideas for the second half of the game. I stopped bothering to explore about 75% of the way through the game and instead just kept to the obviously marked path since there was apparently nothing else to find or see in the giant open areas.\n\nThere are a few areas where the game gets in the way of the immersion. These are only minor at first, but they quickly become more prominent in the late game. Two minor aspects break the game's own rules: oxygen that you only need sometimes and jet fuel that is infinite until you move into the next area. The major problems I constantly experienced were:\n- the astronaut sometimes hits an invisible wall that prevents you from progressing down an otherwise obvious path\n- a rock will look like something you can stand on but the game doesn't let you\n- the astronaut suddenly dies mid-jump because you jumped toward an area you are not supposed to be able to reach\n- when walking forward up a steep incline, if you jump you lose all forward motion and actually go backwards (this one is a huge annoyance considering how often you have to jump uphill)\n\nMore commentary on that last major flaw... This game is a platforming game, and the fact that the platforming is broken is a huge dissapointment.  I was honestly getting angry at the game with how difficult the jump mechanics make it to follow an obvious path through the world.\n\nThe story and environments start really strong, but they significantly decrease at the end of the game. If you want to experience a good story and uncover an interesting history of a fictional distant planet, then certainly give this a shot. If you want a good game, you are probably best off looking somewhere else.","May 26","false","5.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The landscapes, 'biomes' and views were pretty cool.  Story was linear and hand-holdy but interesting enough (along with the scenery) for a play through.  There's also little to gain from checking corners, occasionally there's an optional point of interest that doesn't add a whole lot to the story (geology anyone?).\n\nWhat few puzzles exist are rather basic.\n\nOften transitions between 'levels' are disjointed. You walk to the entrance of a new area, then you get loaded into a completely different part of the planet, in no way resembling where you were or what you were looking at. No explanation for travel given.\n\nSome tension moments are very forced and silly. Filling up on air ("You're set for 8 hours!") and again running out 5 minutes after is not nail-biting tension, it's annoying.

I usually love all kinds of them.\n\nThis one couldn't keep me, only reason I kept playing this game is due to the fact that I don't like reviewing games that I haven't finished.\n\nNothing was really happening and the movement/controls was horrible, really jittery and I constantly got stuck in the envoirment, fell off of things and I also fell through the world multiple times.\nThis game is unfinished. To many bugs including random instadeaths, unreasonable invincible walls, and holes in the world that killed me multiple times. And the movement system in general, as I said, is horrible.\n\nThe game is to linear. Yes, I know this is a walking simulator but it wasn't like they usually are. There was a lack of a beautiful world to look at, lack of any atmosphere really except for triggered sound events and lack of any character. Making the walking through the designated path extremely boring, Dear Esther for example kept me invested. It didn't bore me to death like this one did. Dear Esther told an interesting story and had a beautiful world that kept my screenshot finger ready, this one did not.\n\nThe character you play has horrible voice acting, no personality whatsoever.\n\nI wanted to enjoy the story but I couldn't due to all the other bad factors but the storyline wasn't to bad.\nThis, in my opinion, is far from an adventure game, it's the exact opposite. You can't explore what you want or go where you want like 99% of good exploration walking simulators let you do. You can only follow 1 path, you can only mindlessly walk along the dotted path while pressing W and jumping every once in a while and it gets to boring as I explained earlier.\n\nAnd the graphics, I'm sorry but I can't let this go, this is, graphically, the ugliest walking simulator I've ever played. It looks like it was made in 2003, but no it was developed in 2014 and it has absolutelly horendus graphics, destroying yet another VERY important factor in walking simulators, it needs to have a beautiful world.\n\nThe price point is extremely high for this low content, horrible, unfinished game. 17$ is unacceptable, it's worth more like 2-3$.\n\nI also feel like this game was dragged out to long, the story was more than finished before the actual game ended but it kept getting dragged out through filler content. This game is to long in context of the story.\n\nI don't understand how this could also be called a puzzle game, there is no puzzles in this game, I'm sorry but if you call that hook stuff puzzles then there is something wrong with you.\n\nDo not buy this game, trust me, I've played my fair share of walking simulators and all kinds of games that are always reffered to as "not really a game".\nThis game doesn't hold up. It's horrible and I don't understand how it has so many positive reviews.\n\nGreat concept for a game, couldn't be more horribly executed.\n\n1/10.","April 8","false","3.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

This review ONLY covers the first six levels! With that being said, this is the best EAG I've purchased on Steam. This is one of those games where gameplay kind of takes a back seat for the story. It really does have the spirit of classic action-adventure games. There is no life bar, no weapons, and no HUD whatsoever. All you have is a flashlight, a one-time rechargeable boost jetpack (with an exception...), and a robot arm to grab things. From what I have seen so far the game is fairly linear, with some small diverting paths to grab some 'collectables.'\n\nWhat has won me over to this game is the atmosphere and the mystery of the story (No spoilers, I will be as vague as possible). You start off with one simple mystery: "Where are my buddies?" Then it grows to: "Who is that lady?" Then it snowballs into: "What is that thing!?!" Then the demo abruptly ends… My curiosity has never been so enticed for a game's story in a long long time! Needless to say I really want to play the next levels.\n\nThis game is different and I have trouble thinking of a genre to place it in. It's a Sci fi mystery, it has some elements of horror, some elements of plat-forming, and some elements of puzzle-solving. If you are looking for a horror, shoot 'em up, space horror, this is not your game. If you are looking for a story driven, creepy, atmospheric, sci-fi mystery, this is your game. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs a break from typical AAA gaming and who doesn’t want to play anymore 8-bit style indie games (sorry my 8-bit buddies, I need a break from you as well).\n\n","March 7, 2014","true","1.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

In this game we'll travel through a seemingly empty planet, only to realize that something happened and it's not as dead as we imagined.\n\n\nSpaceWalking Simulator?\nWe'll have to walk a lot, yes, we'll really have to walk long distances completely alone with a relaxing soundtrack in background, which reminded me a lot of Shadow of the Colossus, making long journeys from an objective to the next. It's clear that the focus is not in action, but in convey a feeling of loneliness we'd face if we found ourselves alone in a planet.\n\nThis characteristic could be interpreted as something dull and boring, but it's the complete package we have to judge: environment, music and story. Those three aspects form a symbiosis which amazes the player.\n\nAbout the gameplay: it's simple, with the low gravity of the planet as an ally and jumping to each goal. Other than a few puzzles, we won't find any big problems; this game is more focused in "appreciating" than "thinking".\n\n\nPrepare for amusing chasms\nThe game features beautifully crafted environments in which we'll be able to appreciate the inmensity of the place and realize that many times the lack of life doesn't mean lack of beauty. As I said before and I'm not getting tired of repeating, the scenery which we'll stumble upon are impressive, really a piece of art.\n\nGoing through all kind of environments, from big deserts, old craters, to abandoned towns, lava-filled volcanoes and patrified forests, to mention a few.\n\nThe lighting gives a special touch which we won't be able to forget, it's sky is almost always clouded where only some rays of sunlight can go through, which makes you feel the end is nigh and your time is accounted for, which is no doubt a decisive factor to involve us in the story.\n\n\nTake it easy dude…\nTranquil, and really quiet, with only a few abrupt changes to accelerate the game. If you're looking for a game with lots of action, violence or something alike, this is not the game for you; you'll probably quit after a few minutes.\n\nIt has a rich soundtrack which perfectly accompanies the gameplay, and the ambiance sounds really make you feel like you're in the game. This was all made by Rich Douglas, who also worked in the sountracks for Insurgency and Takedown. Douglas manages to jump from total calm to frenzy without any complications, moments where he conveys happiness and other moments where we'll be invaded with a feeling of adrenaline which makes us be alert.\n\nLifeless Planet is that game you need when you come home tired and need to relax, taking your time to play it and taking it to your own pace, appreciating every little thing in it.\n\n\nIn the last episode…\nDavid Board, its developer, originally planned the game as an action game, but as development progressed and the story expanded, Board decided to change the game's focus to center on the story. We'll be able to notice how it's inspired in classic adventure games like LucasArts' The Dig, as well as platformer game Another World, and science-fiction movies based upon the Cold War. Board said he wanted to convey a combined feeling of optimism and horror about what science is capable of in the hands of mankind.\n\n\nVictim of a great story and false advertisement (spoilers ahead!)\nWe're part of a team of astronauts whose mission is to explore a seemingly empty planet. Something goes wrong with the expedition and we wake up from a cryogenic sleep fifteen years after we boarded the ship to this adventure into the unknown.\n\nWhen we wake up we can't find the rest of the crew and that's where the loneliness starts to take part in our journey. Did the Americans get to the Moon first? Maybe so, but the Soviets managed much more... in a planet! When we arrive we can't find anybody, only the remains of what seems to have been a big enterprise by the Russian. We'll soon realize that this planet is not as lifeless as it seemed in the title, so I'm sorry to have to break the news for you but you've been victim of false advertisement! Irony aside, the place becomes more and more confused as we move forward, with hallucinations about our life on Earth, alien remains and the print of the Russians everywhere. This is where the story truly starts, for we'll soon discover what happened as we search for a way to go back home.\n\nExploration, which seemed like a big part of the game, regrettably doesn't exist... the game is completely lineal and most of the times the way is forced to make us move forward. Maybe it's because Survival and Sandbox games are increasing in popularity lately, but this game is neither; Lifeless Planet intends to tell us a story, show as a world which is dying little by little. And it achieves it so perfectly.","July 14, 2014","true","4.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I can see why some people wouldnt like it, but I also think it was unnecessarily panned by critics. It does a great job a creating an uncertain and desolate atmosphere, and the sense of adventure and mystery was always present. The world is pretty large, and there is definitely a lot of open space where you are just walking, but visually, those moments still do a lot to please the eye. I wouldnt really call this game difficult at all either. Some of the longer jumps can be challenging, but mostly, this game is about the journey more than the challenge itself. Although it took me about 7 hours to complete, it felt like a lot longer, and not in a bad way. The game does a good job of putting you in the astronauts shoes, and the distanes combined with the relative sense of desolation does a good job of distorting time a bit.\n\nThe story itself is pretty sparse overall, but well thought out nonetheless. There are really two stories happening simultaneously and they kind of feed off each other. One (the Russian settlement) is resolved nicely and is actually a pretty cool, 1950's sci-fi movie style story with a bit of an environmentalist message. The other story isnt well resolved in my opinion, but also doesnt really need to be. It sort of leaves it up to you to decide on what the story really means....it does carry a message, but it is also vague enough for plenty different interpretations.\n\nThe actual gameplay involves a lot of running around (a lot), a lot of jumping (utilizing air thrusts for added distance), and the occasional blowing up of or repairing of necessary objects. You are given (about an hour into the game) a portable mechanical arm (like they use in the space shuttles) to help with some of this, and find dynamite every so often as well. Everything has a specific reason for being there in the game (with only one exception), so if you see it and you can interact with it, you need to. There is a bit of doubling back to complete puzzles so you can move on, but for the most part, the game keeps driving you forward and doesnt bog down at all. Since this is story driven (even though it takes a minimalist approach), you are always led to the next stage of the journey smoothly and efficiently.\n\nThe setting itself was pretty amazing in my opinion. It was a beautifully crafted world. At first, its basically all barren and lifeleess, but as you travel across the planet, you start seeing more evidence of life, until eventually, you find verdant expanses of the wild. The subteranean sections are also really cool, but the show stoppers are when you start finding the alien technologies, and the final few sections are visually mindblowing (at least, I thought they were). This was really a stunningly well crafted world from a visual standpoint.\n\nSo, as I said before, this game is all about the journey, and for me, it was a journey filled with so many nuances of human emotion, that it siply could not be ignored. My only complaint is that perhaps it is actually a little long, but really, I thought it was a an interesting game. I'd give it a 7.5 out of 10 or 78 out of 100.","July 17, 2014","true","7.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

You might think that I should've been enjoying the scennery - but there isn't much to enjoy, everything is pretty monotonic - starting from orange and brown hills, through grey and black hills and even some blue glossy hills that probably were meant as glaciers, finally finishing with green hills.\n\nGraphics of this game were pretty outdated, which would be hard to notice, since most of what you see are rocks and hills, but... well, suffice to say that I've seen better character models in games made ten years ago. And you'd think that gamedevs would put some more work into character models, since there are about THREE of those in the entire game.\n\nDying - dying was pretty annoying. I understand the fact that dropping from 100 feet to the ground is lethal, but seeing me fall and turn into bloodied ragdoll about 30 feet above ground is laughable. Similarly, I understand that stepping into lava is lethal, but ragdolling with the cheerful sound of flatline after one step into a burning rock? Am I to understand that burning your toe causes immediate heart failiure?\n\nWell, you might say that this is a story-driven game and what I should look for is good story - and the fact is that story in this game is pretty interesting. But the way it is delivered is, in my opinion, horrible. Voice in this game is used only as single sentences spoken by main character (in plain, monotonic voice) or single words by the Russian girl (which are, obviously, in Russian). Pictures are so confusing that without reading full logs you're not sure what exactly is happening.\n\nSo to sum up, what we have here is neglegible quantity of voice acting, couple of nice pictures and several pages of text.

This Early Access game is a Demo. But don't let that distract you from what a lovely gem it truely is.\nThe game is basically a Story driven walking simulator/platformer. I've read some reviews saying its sort of a puzzler,the only thing that maybe a puzzel to some, is how do i get from A to B. The game is very linea and uses common sence (if there's no path this way, let's take a look that way, or look for some explosives to open a path) if you get my meaning.\n\nYou Play as an Astronaut, that crash landed presumably on the other side of a lush planet but ended up on an open barron lifeless landscape, all alone and confused you wonder where your crew have all gone, you set of your grand hike to uncover the mystery thats befolded you, with many more questions that will arise.\nWhen you first start playing  you may ask your self, ok now where the hell do i go, But with good observation, the path is very clear for you to take. i don't want to go into to much detail into the story, so it's best for you to personally experience it.\n\nSo far I've only came across one bug in the game, that was from selecting to load a last checkpoint while my character was on an elevator platform, Which resulted in me having to start that peticular level again. due to the fact each time i tried reloading, the Camera was stuck on the damned platform.\n\nVisuals and effects - 7.5/10\nEnviroment sounds - 8/10\nVoice Acting ( English and Russian) - 9/10\nStory - (Still a mystery that keeps asking me , whats going on here and who is that lady ) - 10/10\n\nAt the moment the Game is short, but the way the story is played out, it will keep you wanting to move forward and unconver the truth, that remains unknown.\nIf walking alot and not doing much but jump from here to there is not so much your thing, but you're passionate for unraveling mysteries, then you may want to hold out until the game is complete. Cuz damn i was so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at the end of the demo, only cuz i wanted to find out more as what is actualy going on.\nthat being Said; I still highly recommend that you purchase the game as it is, Solely to help out the development team","May 23, 2014","true","6.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Yep, thats right this game was entirely created by one man in Alaska, an impressive feat to say the least.\n\nLifeless planet tells the story of a lone astronaut who crash lands on his destination planet. Alone and running out of air, its time to go into survival mode, find air and see if any of your crew mates survived. You embark out into the wilderness of the Mars like planet with its red canyons and sand filled landscapes.\n\nThe sceptical astronaut soon discovers not only scientific wonders on the planet's surface but begins to see and experience things that cannot be explained. You soon come across signs of life, not alien signs of life mind you but instead the remnants of humanity from earth, specifically remnants of a soviet union outpost. This leads the astronaut to question not only if he is indeed on another planet but also if any of this is even real.","June 6, 2014","true","3.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Third-person exploration, with a good deal of platforming while you jump and jet your way across a beautifully eerie environment, and a fair amount of logic puzzles results in a game very worth breathing life into.

I merely bought it, because it wasn't too expensive and the trailer kinda sounded and looked interesting.\n\nThe main focus in this game is of course the story. And it is actually that story that keeps you glued to the screen for approximately 4 hours, and makes you want to reveal all the secrests of all these mysterious circumstances about an epiditition to an unknown planet. Do yourself a favor and don't read any spoilers, because that would probably ruin the whole game. Honestly, there is not much beside the story.\n\nThere are are some exploring features in it, but nothing goes beyond the level's borders and except for some stones or minerals, everything that is mandatory will be pretty much laid before your feet. The level structure is pretty straight forward. You can't really miss your goal, and the main thing you will do is jumping and running. At first this might sound a bit boring and not really special. But that's okay, because this game's forte lies in the story and that's why you will endure these countless jump and run passages and all these kilometers that you have to run by foot gladly in order to reveal another part of the story.\n\nThe animations and graphics weren't too great, not even on the highest settings. While they were able to provide a certain amount of diversity in the different "levels" or passages, you can't help but get the feeling that everything seems to be a bit simple and plain.\nThe character animations of everything that was not in a spacesuit (I counted 2 people), were awful to be honest. They really reminded me of N64 games where everything looked like a wooden doll. But even that isn't too much of a problem since you will be mostly jumping and running with your astronaut in his spacesuit , and these animation were more than okay.\n\nAll in all, I can recommend this game. Especially to those people who enjoy games like the Stanley Parabel and love to dig into a game's story. It probably won't matter if you are a Jump and Run fan or not. As long as you like storydriven games, you will enjoy this one a lot. When I started it today, it kept me glued to the screen for 4 hours straight because I desperately wanted to solve the mystery about this planet and all the strange occurences that accured there. And the same will hopefully happen to you too.\n\n","June 21, 2014","true","6.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Seriously, it starts very slowly, some clanky mechanics that might stop you playing but then, you start finding out curious stuff in it. Exploration is not worthwhile but the main goal, which is to find whatever the hell happened to you and your buddies, makes you see and go through a lot of hard terrain. The puzzles are extremely easy to solve but like I said, the fact that you're in a different planet, with erm, interesting stuff lying around, makes it a very compromising game for me. Seriously, I love day dreaming about space travelling and finding life outside the solar system so this game kind of hit that spot in me. Nothing really brilliant but the setting, the goal, the story and I must say, the graphics, make it all worthwhile.

It took me 5 hours to playthrough, and that was with LOTS of exploring, and leaving (almost) no corners unturned.\n\nGameplay wise, it's quite straightforward - you can jump and boost with your jetpack. No guns, no shooting. Essentially a 3d platformer set against the backdrop of a beautifully bleak alien planet. A relaxing combo for me personally, which is exactly what I wanted from this game.\n\nI found the story itself very enjoyable, however I had one major gripe: Between 'levels', the transition from previous to next scene was more often than not jarringly different, with no explanation. You could be walking down a path towards something, then the game would load the next area which was starkly different, and sometimes it would switch from day to night. The story is delivered via soliloquies and recovered logs.\n\nAlso, be prepared to get lost often. The path is not always clear, and the puzzles are not exactly well indicated - but this made the game feel more realistic for me!\n\nOverall, it was a very satisfying experience, but a little bit rough around the edges in terms of continuity/explanation between levels. Despite it's minor issues, I had a lot of fun playing Lifeless Planet, and recommend it to anyone with a love of sci-fi.","July 14, 2014","true","5.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I think $10 fits the value of the game pretty well. It's definitely an indie game, with lots of rough edges and levels of detail that are occasionally frustratingly lacking. You spend the entire game as a little astronaut man running around this planet with seam-heavy level transitions and a very linear path (not straight but definitely always on a rail). Given the type of gameplay, the linearity is definitely appropriate, it's just that it's a big, dull planet with some pretty ridiculous obviously computer heightmap generated canyons and crevices that steal away any suspension of disbilief.\n\nBut it does make for some interesting sci-fi. The concept is interesting. It's kind of a movie type of plot where all you do is sit back and learn, slowly, what it is you're looking at. The gameplay is extremely dull, however, because the only challenges, with the exceptional of three or four mini-puzzles, are "don't jump too far" and "*splat!* no not that ledge, the other one". You have no weapon and there are only about three types of things you can push or carry. That's it, the rest of the time you're running. Run! Run, Forrest, run!\n\nWith simplistic graphics and limited gameplay, I still recommend the game, but I rate it a 3.3/5.","May 17","true","5.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Started yesterday at last and finished just now.\n\nLet me preface by saying I like exploration and slowly uncovering stories through (audio-)logs. If done right it truly can make for great and immersive experiences.\nLifeless Planet is only about that. Without spoiling too much, you are an astronaut on a mission to travel to a distant planet and promptly have a crash-landing. From there you start exploring a barren and alien world which from the get-go grabs your attention with alien structures and mysterious occurrences.\n\nThe story I liked a lot. The one-man team has obviously interest in sci-fi. The pacing is fine but more on the slow-side. You have to bring some patience and be in the mood to walk. But I would not say this is a "boring walking simulator". Platforming with your jetpack and light puzzle solving are plenty. There is no shooting but that is just perfect for this game.\n\nGiven it is a small developer don't go in expecting high-poly models, high-res textures and whatnot. It might deter superficial players at first but I adjusted to it just fine after a couple minutes. One thing which I usually never give too much mind in games struck to me throughout the whole game though. Music, or better lack of therein. Big patches have no background music which made me much more uneasy than I expected. There are some short tunes at certain events here and there but they only emphasize the parts without it that much more. Music is much more important to the overall experience than one might imagine.\n\nI don't want to spoil much, so I'll stop here. It has a great story and atmosphere and I was always interested in unraveling more about the world. Loved the ending.

You get six levels (there are twenty) to play with and it took me a little under two hours.  I could probably have done it quicker.\n\nI don't really want to say much about the storyline, other than you'll soon come to realise the lifeless planet is and isn't.\n\nSo, is it good, or is it bad -- or even something in between?\n\nTo start, the game is fully playable.  The sparse and open environments do lend to a lifeless feel, although the opportunity to explore is very limited and in effect is very much a directed affair.  One shouldn't feel too lost or wondering where and what to do with visual cues.  But like I say, the player is very much funneled.  You can't get lost.  This doesn't mean it's a bad thing.\n\nI know in many reviews the atmosphere was highly rated.  Over rated, IMO, but still suitable for the game -- although it does have its moments.  The story elements that are slowly dripped to the player are what count here.  And I have to confess that I wanted to keep playing just to unravel the mystery of the planet.  That was the hook for me, and works very well.\n\nI wish there was a maybe button for recommendation.  I don't think it is justifiable to pay ten english sterling for this early access which in fact is (at the end of the six levels is stated as) a demo!  On the other hand, if and when the product is released and the rest of the game is free (or extrememly discounted) then it would be a thumbs up.\n\n**EDIT** In case the developer's reply/comment is missed, the full game is given to those who pay for early access.  And that's pretty cool.\n\nThe game is intriguing.   But if you're a frugal type, you may well be disappointed with what you get for your monies worth.  On the other hand, if you don't mind spunking a tenner and have a little bit of time to kill then give it a go.\n\nIt's neither a thumbs up, or a thumbs down.  But, if I had to pick one (and I do)...","March 8, 2014","true","1.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

There's a handfull of jumping puzzles and occasional "press buttons in the correct sequence" puzzles to solve to be able to advance the story. The path is pretty much linear but allows you to do a little bit of exploration in some of the areas. Visually the game is just about OK and the controls are about the same level.\nIf it had been a full price game I would have been furious due to how short the game is. I played it through in less than 4 hours, and that includes spending at least one hour trying to recover from what I believe is a glitch in the game that could have been avoided if there was a proper save function implemented instead of the automatic checkpoint save system.\nIf there was a "Maybe" option I would press it, don't buy if you want an adventure that will keep you entertained for a long time.\n","February 20, 2015","false","5.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It looks like an open world and there is a lot of space in which to run, but by and large there is only one path to progress the story and lots of dead ends along the way.  Lots of running, lots of jumping, and it does get to be tedious after a while.  Every time I ran into a situation where I couldn't progress the story but it seemed like if I just timed this jump just right I'd make the landing and things would go forward, but instead I'd just keep dying over and over, in truth it turned out that there was actually a puzzle hidden somewhere off-the-beaten path that was overlooked so I had to go explore every nook and cranny to find where the puzzle was.  There's a number of 'puzzles' in the game though once you do one or two to understand how they work they are pretty simple to solve.  As immersive and excellent as the atmosphere of Lifeless Planet is though, these shortcomings are pretty easy to overlook.\n\nAtmosphere - atmosphere is what Lifeless Planet does best and at a level not many games out there can keep up with.  The graphics are imaginative and alien and beautiful.  I would love to play this again on a high-end gaming PC just for that experience.  Mine's just middle-of-the-ground PC but the game really begs to be revisited whenever I can upgrade - it's just too beautiful and alien to not.  Music is spot on and never intrudes.  What little voice acting is in the game is done well, too.\n\n\nStory.........\n\nI don't know if the gamemakers were too overambitious or just lacked a professional writer on the team to tie it all in together better.  There's a few different plotlines and unfortunately they are all undeveloped.  The most story by far goes into what happened with the Russians and that is learned entirely by finding and reading documents or listening to audio recordings.  Far too much of the present-day story that you actually play in is progressed solely by you do this or you go here simply because it is the only thing to do or the only place to go.  Your are given a little bit of backstory for your character at the beginning of the game, which honestly is enough to get things in motion and get the game going, but any sort of character development is pretty much ignored until the very end of the game where those original few sentences of backstory are integral to so the whole thing ends up just coming across as shallow and anticlimatic.\n\nThere's also a few transitions between scenes or chapters where the screen will fade-to-black, sometimes unexpectedly, and the new scene starts in a new location and even if there is a cut-scene it lacks any explanation for the transition.  It was twice, maybe three times, I had to pause and look up some YouTuber Let's Play videos because I thought I had missed something.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nI enjoyed the game.  Spaceman on a dead planet and all you got is your spacesuit.  "Ummmmmmmmmm......."  Yeah, it's bloody brilliant.\n\nSetting and atmosphere are awesome and at a level all games should aspire to.\n\nIt's just the story falls way flat in a game that should be story-driven.\n\nI think you're better off waiting for a sale to buy.  Maybe I'm a cheapskate, but that $10-15 range seems like a fair price for an incredibly atmospheric game, but there's enough story issues I'd feel let down if I paid $20.","December 14, 2014","true","8.3"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

The story became even more engaging, the lifeless planet even more mysterious.  The resolution was satisfying.\n\nIt is difficult to classify this game without underselling it.  There is a great sense of exploration, like you are really trekking across an alien landscape, but the landscape itself - though it sometimes doesn't feel it - is very linear.  You have to learn to jet from ledge to ledge, but it's not really a platformer - even though there were two points in the game where I had to reattempt a jump repeatedly to get it right.\n\nAlthough there are puzzles, don't approach Lifeless Planet as a puzzle game in the style of Myst et al, because the puzzles here are really there to emphasise the alien wonder of the place, not to challenge.  On that front the alien nature of this place is well thought out, cohesive and, looking back, with all the information, absolutely realistic, even though as you progress it is hard to see where all this is going.\n\nNo, what this is is an exploration of an idea of what life could be like on other planets, and all the rest is the vehicle necessary to take us on that journey.  From that perspective it is very well executed, both technically and as a story.  The game is beautiful and stark and alien, the plot is perfectly paced, and the experience is deep and engaging.  When you stumble across the journal of someone who was here before you, you spend the next part of your journey pondering the meaning of their words until the planet throws something new at you you distract you, perfectly bridging the human story and the story of planetary exploration.\n\nYou can complete the game in one sitting of about three to five hours depending on how long you marvel at the scenery and how much time you spend thinking on the things you find.  There's not a lot of replayability here, as with most narrative games, but it feels the perfect length, with no padding and nothing skimmed over in too little detail.\n\nOne word of caution: I would advise ignoring the achievements, as hunting them can break your immersion.  If they come organically, they come, although several won't unless you do things completely unnatural given the circumstances, like loitering for a long time at a location where there is no reason to loiter.\n\nEarly Access review:\nBeautiful and evocative and mysterious.  Just be aware that it cuts off rather abruptly at a certain point when things are just getting really interesting, as that's as far as this early access game has been developed at this point.  Still very much worth a quick play though, even in its trunctated form, as apparently more elements will be added to the game so far, as well as its continuation.","May 24, 2014","true","7.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The environment and atmosphere are just stunning, and paired with a story full of secrets and mystery makes the player crave to keep going. I love it when a game makes you question things, try to figure out what's actually going on, rather than just handing you all the answers. The game reminds me a lot of Dear Esther as there are no monsters that need to be fought (thus far) and you are alone in this world (kind of...), but I feel that the story being told by Lifeless Planet is more compelling. I bought Dear Esther and plyed it a few times, and while the story was enjoyable, I have no real appetite to play it repeatedly. Lifeless Planet, on the other hand, I just cannot get enough of. I can't wait for the full release, or even to just get the next couple of chapters.\n\nI will say that the controls can bug on you, but they're very rare and easy enough to fix. The graphics may not be the most advanced in the gaming industry, but are still very high quality and really shouldn't take away from your experience at all.

Sure there will be more gameplay, but that Demo was very fun to play.

Otherwise, a really good game.\n9/10 Will wait anxiously for more content.","March 26, 2014","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay really leads you to focus on the story and character. Seems the developers really understood how to add a bit of suspense to this.

It does have a good mix of easy and more challenging puzzles, that you kind of have to think about, and has multiple facets in which the puzzles are based around so as to add variety. The current beta is rather short (around 30-80 minutes depending on how fast you go), and ends on a bit of a clifhanger, so if you are looking to play the full game right now, you can't, but once it is released, you can, and the beta is cheaper than the full game will be when released, so get it now and enjoy what is currently implemented, and make sure to give your feedback to the author\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nFULL RELEASE REVIEW: If you just read the beta review, then you saw how much I looked forward to seeing the end product of the game, and now that its here, I must say I am rather dissapointed actually. The beta levels had such rich atmosphere and mystery, and they had so much promise, but after I passed through that green door on June 6th, eager to play through the rest of the game, the mystery just fell apart, and took the game with it. I would forgive these if it wasn't for the $20 price tag. The game is too small, and, as just stated, falls apart after the beautifully crafted beta levels, to be priced at $20. I still recommend the game to cold war fans, platformer fans, and to people just looking for a nice fun game to spend a few hours in, just wait for a sale, I could justify $10 on this.","June 11, 2014","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As a sci-fi fan I long for a game that can take me to unknown worlds and let me explore them and Lifeless Planet seemed to be that game.\n\nI immediately acquired the early access and was very satisfied to it's initial promise. Plus, doing a bit of research I discovered that one of the main influences for this game would be my favourite game of all time - Another World - that not only is an excellent sci-fi work but, most importantly and in my personal opinion, it holds until today the top spot on how game mechanics can help you deliver a superb narrative.\n\nAnd in did, on the early stages, the game delivers. The mystery starts to unravel at a good pace, the environments do a great job on setting a mood by first offering the familiarity, and at the same time the duality, of a world that can be either Earth like or Mars like, and then throwing you with a very interesting twist that finally launches the adventure.\n\nHere the problems start, as the game is unable to hold the standards of its good beginning. With landscapes becoming tiresome and the wonders of exploration diluted on unimaginative mechanics and intrusive narrative.\n\nSadly the game never overcomes completely the said narrative and mechanics problems, but the world does gets better, with some excellent stages that made me connect again with my initial appeal for this game - I just wanted to feel like I was on another planet. Also, as you get to the latter stages, it manages to bring the narrative back to life and makes you realize that this could in fact be a much better game, but maybe due to inexperience it kind of get lost in it self.\n\nStill, despite the wasted potential, I say it's worth to buy. Specially to sci-fi fans like me that feel like videogames lack offer when it comes to sci-fi adventures.

If you're a fan of indie games such as Journey, you'll love this gem. The visuals are stunning in a minimalist manner, and even my poor little Lenovo i3 G560 can handle the graphics, albeit at the lower settings.  The in-game music is orchestrated beautifully.  The splash of Russian language (translated by your Holoreader of course) combined with the narrative of our hero adds to the desperate overtones and mystery behind what happened to the intrepid adventurers.

For a game to do that before you actually start delving in to the story and playing through the demo is impressive. At times, I felt this demo was truly impossible because I walked telling myself "I really have no idea where to go/what to do." It makes you think. The setting was another important characterisitic of the game that I enjoyed. I don't play games as much as I used to so I could be wrong, but I have yet to see a space game that relies on an abandoned planet. I see a lot of planets infested with aliens and such, but not one with an empty planet. I'm sure I speak for some when I say that it works pretty well. One problem I did have was urgency. I know I said that the player starts to understand that there is a problem, but I feel no sense of urgency or danger. Yeah you have rocks, tornadoes, electricity, and falling to your death, but they don't make me feel worried all that much. I'm not sure if this would but add more situations like the falling rocks and tornadoes cause I never those coming, which made them a nice surprise. All in all, worth playing, hope this helps/makes sense.","May 14, 2014","true","2.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love the engine, you can feel the atmosphere in this game, it is almost palpable.  I like the oxygen mechanic...I had some frantic moments making a dash for the nearest reaupply point.\nThe environment is amazing, I love the look of the world, and having multiple places to be able to get to, and explore, is a nice reward.  I eagerly await further developments, and contiunued exploration, of the Lifeless Planet.  One last thought, as i played, I wondered if what this engine could do for a game based on H.P. Lovecrafts's "At The Mountainsa of Madness"...I mean the terrain and views, with the ambient background music....man, I would love to see that, and I think this engine could do that story wonders.....snow covered peaks, footprints, and caves.

Thus far it's well-written, the voice acting is excellent, the atmosphere and mood are exceptionally well-set, and the environments and mystery interesting. I'm not averse to indie games, but they have to have something special to hold my interest. Lifeless Planet definitely has that secret sauce. Looking forward to continuing the journey.\n\nUPDATE: After finishing it, I have to say my opinion did not change one bit. This is a fantastic game and well worth playing!

The story progressed hastily and haphazardly, culminating in random information being thrown in at the last minute. All of it given great importance in an attempt attempt to explain the strange turns the story would take.\n\nThe controls can be very unreliable.  Moments requiring precision are completed more with luck rather than skill, the camera does everything it can to fight you, resulting in alternative paths(even neccessary paths) blocked, hidden, or difficult to get to.  The player can turn on a dime or require huge turning arcs.  Either happening at any moment, but usually not when you really need it.  Turning left on a rock can find your character swerving off the edge, where turning right can see you spinning in place.  Landing on the same rock in a slightly different position, can yield different results.\n\nThe saving system is unreliable at best.  Several times I would return to the game to find my character standing somewhere he had been ages ago, and having to plow through areas I had already completed just to progress the story(even having seen the game save my progress up to the point I remember).\n\nThough, there were also several moments where the game would lead to a dead end, which was actually the end of the level.  The screen would fade to black and return with you standing in a completely different and unrelated area.  Also, the camera is notorious for loading with you pointing or facing in the wrong direction.  One zone you can load with your character facing the right way but not the camera, the next, the camera is facing the right way but not your character.  When loading new areas that don't start at a wall similar to one the last zone ended with, you can find yourself exploring the "dead end" of a level's starting area.  Forcing you to turn around and trudge back up the way you came in order to advance.\n\nEventually I found myself towards the end of the game, pushing forward simply with the belief that I was almost done.  Thankfuly the strange turns happened in quick succesion and I found myself looking at the portal home.  I find myself disappointed at how the game and story turned out, and ashamed that my own stubborness drove me to finish it.  But, I'm glad its finally over and I can retire this title to the graveyard never to be touched again.","February 21, 2015","false","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Throughout the entire game you're going to basically be following a path that the game has laid out for you, and at times this can get boring but for the most part it's okay because you are going to constantly be faced with platform challenges, deadly plant enemies, puzzles, amazing sights to see, and hidden mineral collectibles along the way. Lifeless Planet also has alot of variety in its stages and each new "level" will have a different look to keep things fresh. Some stages are bright, some are dark, foggy, windy, hot environments, cold environments, overgrown plants, hot springs, huge cliffs, forests, deserts, ect.

It was fantastic, soaring, epic and really helped with the overall immersion of the game. Definitely worth $20.\nThe size of the game was also great, and the added bonus of the search for the minerals was also a plus! Game size definitely worth $20.\nThe story line was a little scattered.

I just reached a point in the game where my character remarks on what to him look like one type of entities that were engulfed by root creatures. But all I saw were knarly trunks that didn't take any distinguishable shape. The game also has jarringly brief and tense cutscenes that, due to their brevity, drop you back into gameplay before you have finished taking in what you just saw. And then, for some reason, sound affects seem to prefer being mostly in the right channel. And the game relies on awful 3D jumping puzzles. They stop the game pacing when you keep blowing a jump because of unpredictable momemtum. Final complaint is about the broken menus. Why, for a game listed as having full controller support does it stop responding to the controller? Seriously, I have to go back to keyboard just to close up the main menu.

It's always nice to have a simple one or two word answer to such foolish enquiries, and I can now safely add the words "Lifeless Planet" to my list of possible responses.\n\nThink Dear Esther on a mysterious alien world, with a third-person perspective and a great deal more "gameplay" and danger added into the bargain - mostly of the 3D "platforming" type, if a tag MUST be placed upon it - and you're definitely getting warm here.  Like Esther, it has gorgeous graphics, a genuinely interesting storyline and mood aplenty...with a fair few more "action"-y elements added for those who might require such things.  This still isn't a title likely to appease the aggro-gamer crowd who require something to be relentlessly "hard" in order to enjoy it, but for those of us who don't mind oodles of atmosphere and adventure along with our little bursts of action...it's a right little gem.  Let me put it another way:  While the game is still REASONABLY fast-paced - providing you follow it in as linear a path as possible - you're not liable to fully appreciate it unless you fancy yourself playing a kind of intergalactic "tourist" on a bizarre alien planet (hence the Dear Esther reference earlier...a game which really is, when all is said and done, a slightly spooky and visually stunning sight-seeing tour across an interesting landscape).\n\nWhich isn't to say that Lifeless Planet is a mere "walking simulator" as the cynics like to term such games, but, well...about half of it is, unless you speed-run the ♥♥♥♥ing thing.  And let's face it, if you're one of those speed-running types, do us ALL a favour and look at the ♥♥♥♥ing screenshots on the Store page...does this REALLY look like your kind of game?  Of course it doesn't.  Now ♥♥♥♥ off and play Serious Sam 7 for the twenty-second time, you boring ♥♥♥♥, and stop criticising games which are clearly labours of love, created for the primary purpose of taking those of us endowed with sufficient imagination on an enjoyable and - upon occasion, at least - genuinely AWE-INSPIRING journey.\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.","October 9, 2014","true","9.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Most of the time you had just the background music and nothing else – this created a good atmosphere. Spacesuit, surrounding objects and the jump and run appear fitting for this game and planet.\n\nIn my opinion you are very limited in your choices to run and interact on this huge planet. A lot of empty areas and little areas with exploring for achievements. Upgrades are only available, as long as you need them to proceed during the story. (Example: You receive a jet-pack fuel to jump higher. This is available an unlimited time and unlimited uses until you reach point X and it is immediately depleted). The chapters start and ending is also quite abrupt. No cut scene or a link to the previous chapter. You are running over a bridge and – bam – you are standing on a hill, no bridge or something in sight.\n\nI would like to vote ‘meh’ but it is not available.\nIf you like such ‘running and jumping around accompanied by a little story’ – go for it.","September 18, 2015","false","4.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Now that I'm playing it myself for the first time, I've assumed that no aspect of the game would surprise me anymore (I wanted to play it despite that assumption). But my assumption was wrong: in the first three levels I've stumbled upon goodies none of the players I've watched discovered: tricky ramps and hills, seemingly inascendable, that could be climbed on with a bit of patience; minerals others missed; scripted events (mostly noises and music); a few bugs and quirks here and there -- equally fun, at least for me.\n\nSo I'm enjoying every aspect of the game, even after having seen spoilers for months. That's how good the game is in my view.\n\nBut the main reason, maybe the only reason, why I love playing this game (which is by now almost completely spoiled for me all to the end) -- it's the incredible atmosphere that keeps pulling me in. The vast landscapes, the part-familiar, part-alien geology, the awesome soundtrack and the unfolding story are part of this atmosphere that just resonates with me.  I recommend playing »Lifeless Planet« and taking time exploring it.

I'll try to make this review as good as I possibly can.\n\nLifeless Planet sends the player into an unknown world full of mysteries and puzzles to solve. You play as an astronaut (whose name I have sadly already forgotten), who was sent to a planet far away from earth. After having spent 15 years in a spaceship, the protagonist finally arrives at the already described destination but is quickly confronted with a problem: a lack of oxygen. This is where the game starts.\n\nMy first impression: It looks nice. I have always been a fan of games showing an atmosphere that sticks with you for a while. This game probably is one of them, since it never ceases to amaze the player with nice-looking surroundings. Another aspect I really love about this game is the music and its voiceacting, whereas I would have loved to have more of both. The player gets to listen to small pieces of a conversation between the protagonist and a woman from time to time which I always thought were interesting. They give a small insight on the astronaut's past. The Russian audiologs were very cool as well. (9/10 for the audio. 10/10 if there had been more)\n\nThe astronaut soon discovers a Russian village and - of course - can't believe his eyes and thus believes that he is back on earth and that he has been played a trick on. From this point on the player moves from one area to another, which usually are connected to each other by small puzzles. The already mentioned audiologs and documents help the player to understand where he is and what has happened. Not too much time in the game and you are confronted with a female inhabitant, living on the planet you are walking on. Your main aim from now on is to follow her and to try to get some answers to the many questions that are still open. Don't worry, at the end none of them should be left.\n\nThe story was interesting to follow. At first I did not expect the documents to be able to tell a whole story, but now - after having played the game - I can say that I didn't have any problems understanding the plot. I find it very well thought out and would thus give it a 9/10.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful. Of course, you can't compare it to other newer titles or the Crysis games, but that's not what the game developers tried to go for anyway. I was positively surprised by the many areas you walk through and are able to (partly) discover. It varies from a desert-like landscape to glaciers, waterfountains, lava, forests, and much, much more. Designing these many arials must require creativity which this game sure didn't lack of. The graphics fit the game just well, so I'll give it a 8/10\n\nGameplay. That's where Lifeless Planet doesn't hold up to the price it is being sold for. I wouldn't say that it was not fun for me to play, not at all. There are many repetitive parts and puzzles which you usually soon get the hang of, but the different surroundings and dangerous, creepy traps made it a new experience every time. Nevertheless, most of it was rather easy to solve and I never really found myself in a situation, where I had to think for more than 5 minutes in order to find the solution for a problem. A big part of the game consists of jumping from platform to platform which - once you have required the extra boost for your jetpack - is really fun. The controls were the average ones which were not a problem for me (thus giving them a 10/10), whereas some other people have complained about them being too sloppy or unprecise when doing long jumps. All in all the gameplay could have been a lot better by adding a greater variety of puzzles and missions to solve, but the surroundings made up for it and I often caught myself simply exploring what there was - even though most of the times there was nothing worth to see expect a collectible mineral. 6/10\n\nIt took me about 7 hours to play through the whole game, but I really tried to take a look at everything instead of rushing through one area to the next one. In another review someone had written, the author said that the game was too short and that the achievement for the first playthrough being under 4 hours was too easy. Well, I have to disagree. You can get many more hours out of it when really looking for the minerals (which are worth two achievements too by the way) and exploring hills and buildings. I believe that 7 hours for a 10€ game is a good deal.\n\nLet's come to an end. I definitely recommend playing Lifeless Planet when you are someone who doesn't need highend graphics or a moment of action every five minutes. This game is - in my opinion - made for people who are patient, who like to take their time and who focus on music and sound, because that's where the game scores. It sometimes reminded me and can be compared to a game like "Journey" on the PlayStation. It is worth 10€, but I probably wouldn't buy it for the original price, which is 20€.\n\nI hope this review convinced you to either buy or not buy this game. Thank you for reading.\n\nP.S.: The game scared me at some points. It was all good and fun though. :)","August 6, 2014","true","7.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blindreflections/recommended/261530/","blindreflections","BlindReflections","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blindreflections/","520 products in account","More than a review, this simply aims to be a collection of thoughts on my experience with the game.\nI was honestly very excited when I first heard of this title. Sadly, it didn't really live up to expectations.\nNot that it's a BAD game, it's just not consistent and often breaks the immersion and atmosphere. Which is a shame: this game would otherwise really do a great job in creating a haunting experience.\n\nOne example:  roughly a few minutes into the game, after the impact, you find your oxygen levels are dropping dramatically due to a leak. After running to an oxygen tank, you will be able to fill up (and magically fix the leak) and be left with an autonomy of approx 8 hours.\n\nShortly after that you will find your way to the Russian town where, among other things, you'll find another oxygen tank. Remember where it is, because you are likely going to use it more than once, as oxygen will run out within minutes and you'll have to track your steps back to it quite often until you unlock the next zone - which is where the game just resets its own rules: for most of the time your oxygen will last you days, with the exception of a few areas. You can argue that, as the game has cutscenes, you will have filled up in the period of time we weren't in control of him for - but there are plenty of areas you'll be roaming for a relatively long time without a worry.\nThis may sound like a really minor thing to complain about, but it's one of many the immersion suffers from.\n\nAnother aspect that feels often unnatural is that of puzzles: more often than not, the puzzles will feel completely irrelevant - you can safely pick up the green stones with your hands, but you NEED the robotic arm to place them in a slot roughly at the same height as your head, triggering a mini game. When you feel you might actually have found a use for the arm it won't be available for use, as it's only triggered when close to an object it is designed to interact with.\n\nThe puzzles overall are never overly challenging, with the game mainly focusing on jumping, and simply feel out of place - situations that require you to interact with objects to actually clear a path are scarce, and when you do come up with a clever idea, the game just won't cooperate with you.\nIt's not a bad design choice in itself, it just feels like the dev threw any potential the game had out the window.\n\nAs for the story, it is obviously the aspect that should keep you playing the game until the end - but again, it starts with an intriguing premise and loses it's strength in the later chapters.\n\nWhat the game does achieve though, is in creating its atmosphere through haunting sound effects and a well placed soundtrack, which alone manages to keep the player on edge.\n\nOverall, I'd still recommend this if you can overlook it's flaws - the story is not without surprises, and the atmosphere it creates tries hard to make up for most of what the game lacks in mechanics.","November 10, 2014","true","5.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The environments in the game ar vast and the locations you goto are many.There are a few gameplay elements added that add to the fact you are a astronaut such as need to replenish oxygen and need to use suits jump gets. As you progress ingame a certain amount of time passes as you get from point to point so you will play from day to night.Ruins of what you find wil be found everywhere as well as signs of what happened.\n\nThe storytelling is done quite well and is more original than one would think.I can say the environment & puzzle/platforming meld quite well pulling you into the immersion exprience the game has. The puzzles are not too difficult at all,but there are some areas in the game where one can tell a slight design flaw based on if you mess up to much and cannot reset making you have to start from ur last save point area or checkpoint.\n\nOther than an annoying major bug where the save & quit function can become unacccessible the game is solid though a bit laggy at some parts. The game auto saves when you get to certain areas and there are checkpoints throughout your play so you hardly have to backtrack to much if something goes wrong. Get it on the cheap, or pay the full price, game is worth playing if you like the adventure/explore platforming puzzle gamess.","September 11, 2014","true","9.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

You're playing one of the Astronauts sent to a distant planet that is thought to be filled with various kinds of life. With the journey taking more than a dozen years to reach it's destination, even though the spaceship is travelling twice the speed of light, the crew is put into a cryosleep. On reaching the planet something goes terribly wrong and a landing pod with all of the crew still asleep is crashed into the planet's surface. Some time after the crash landing, the protagonist regains consciousness only to find out that all of the crew is gone, landing pod is damaged beyond repair, his space suit is leaking oxygen and the planet itself turns out to be the wasteland with no signs of life. However after spotting and following the footprints in the sand you discover a derelict Soviet Union outpost, and this is where the protagonist starts to question if their mission was a hoax.\nWith the game starting out as a more straightforward sci-fi thriller, especially after encountering a strange woman who can walk the surface of the planet without the need for a special suit with the supply of oxygen, even with the influences of the early science fiction films of the first half of the last century (particularly Aelita[en.wikipedia.org] and Woman in the Moon[en.wikipedia.org]) it is very interesting to watch how the game expands it's story into a more intelligent and thoughtful themes. If you're familiar with the works of the great Stanislaw Lem[en.wikipedia.org], particularly the ones that explore attempts at communicating with an alien intelligence (see: "Solaris", "The Invincible" and "Fiasco") you will know what I mean. Having said that, I also have to say that as other great pieces of art Lifeless Planet is using those influences to tell it's own story. With the main themes of game being the ones of ecology and how species interact with the biosphere; Fermi paradox[en.wikipedia.org] and the concept of otherness; and of course the story of the main protagonist, which ties it all together through his own personal loss in the past that he overcomes by finding out the story of that mysterious woman and the chain of events that led the planet to a state in which you found it.","November 7, 2014","true","6.0"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

The character controls like a drunk toddler, and it's hard to judge distances. This often leads to you walking off ledges unintentionally because you overshot a jump, and needed to turn around. On top of this the levels were HUGE, with practically nothing to explore. I didn't expect a lot of gameplay, but I expected to not struggle with hopping between platforms purely because my character handled horribly. The story was ok, but only because of there being a bunch of logs for you to find and hear little snippets of information from. I almost expected upon reaching the scene with his wife for this to all turn out to be some kind of delusional haze he was in, but instead I found the story of his wife having virtually no tie to the story.

While the action is pretty minimal in this game, it makes up for it in atmosphere and the soundtrack.  My only gripes are the platforming occasionally feels a bit wonky and sometimes what you're supposed to do isn't very clear.  I only encountered this problem twice though.  Oh and sometimes between levels, it feels like I skipped a cutscene.  Although, I don't think it was the case.  The level transitions are just a bit jarring sometimes.

I plowed through it in one play session lasting about 4 hours. It is very hard to put this game down once you take it up. The fact that the menu wouldn't let me hit "Save and Quit" for some reason was only a small contribution to my one shot playthrough.\n\nThe story reminds me very much of the 50's though 70's era sci-fi books I loved to read as a kid, and while it is not the most challanging game (the hardest puzzle only took me a couple of minutes to solve, and the hardest challanges of navagation took me less than 10 tries), the storyline is definately enough to make this game worth playing.\n\nI would recomend this game to anyone who loves games that have a story to tell.

The chartacter graphics arent anything to write home about, but the surroundings are great in most cases....and come on you have a bloody Jet pack, all games get points for throwing that in.\n\nHowever if your willing to pay this for the game, go for it, its a quick fun game to enjoy, although I was really hoping for allot more out of this game.","June 7, 2014","true","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story just became so addictive that I really couldnt put it down without finding out *all* the answers. If i'm honest, this game felt and played a lot like Portal 2. Between the mysticism of the woman and the wrecked terrain with a beautiful past, combined with the small collections of puzzles ( -which I *really* grew fond of) I really enjoyed just admiring the story that was presented to me.\n\nThe only thing I could nick at is that the wallpaper shown on a loading screen (the screen with the writing and mathematical equations) didnt really fit the story. "Three or Four crew?" really became redundant as after we'd met two of them and progressed far into the storyline.\n\nGenerally speaking, this is one of the best story-driven game i've played since Portal 2. I'm really happy with how it plays and functions as more of an experience than a game (which, contrary to some peoples opinion is OK!) and would love to see more games like this in the future.\n\n(Thanks for bringing my attention to this game, KurtJMac and YogscastSips!!)","June 7, 2014","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theneomaster/recommended/261530/","theneomaster","TFX | Neo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theneomaster/","368 products in account","Lifeless Planet is certainly a novel idea, and although this review is a "recommended" one, this game does have its issues, and to be honest I can't really say I RECOMMEND it right now. I just feel that anyone who sees the red thumbs down on a review for a game that they like will just instantly hate on it without seeing what it has to say. Overall, I have mixed feelings about it. This is a spoiler-free review, so please read on.\n\nI'm not going to say anything about the story, except that the ending felt really unsatisfying for me. Other than that, I enjoyed it, and it certainly is a memorable experience... but it's just one of those things that I feel would work better as a movie than a game, at least in its current form. There is SO much walking without much happening, so many jumping puzzles which are made extra annoying by the walking mechanics--which make you move FORWARDS a little upon pressing S, before turning around. This has made me fall off of the edges of things countless times. There are very few puzzles and gameplay elements in between the walking, which aren't paticularly challenging... just dull.\n\nAs for the graphics, they generally look a bit dated, but the skies and distant landscapes do look beautiful. The lighting isn't that bad either. However, I do seem to run into very random and inexplicable frame drops. (I have an i5-2500k and an AMD 7950.) Although this doesn't occur very often, one minute I can be getting 120FPS, the next it drops down to 15-30 in similar environments. Yes, I'm running on the highest settings, but my setup SHOULD be able to handle this game on the highest settings. The performance in this game is kind of unacceptable right now. Maybe it's something specific to AMD cards, who knows. I'm very disappointed with the performance in any case.\n\nNow, I love games about exploring desolate and abandoned things, such as in Portal 2 when you went though old aperture. That was honestly my favorite part of the game. Despite my frustration over the excessive walking and lackluster gameplay in Lifeless Planet, it managed to capture the same sort of atmosphere that made me enjoy the old aperture part of Portal 2.\n\nReally, whether I would recommend this game to you or not depends on your attitude towards "walking simulators." If you're one of the people who can tolerate Dear Esther, happy to just sit back and take in the pretty environments, then I'll hazard a guess to say that you will probably enjoy this game. If you dislike games where there is more walking than gameplay--in the case of Lifeless Planet, FAR more walking--then I would advise you to steer clear.\n\nTo clarify, I am someone who dislikes Dear Esther, but loves The Stanley Parable--in fact it's one of my favorite games of all time. So I don't necessarily mind games where there isn't much "gameplay", just ones where there is too much walking without anything particularly interesting happening. Which is sadly, at least in my view, the case for Lifeless Planet.\n\nI'd like to state that I enjoyed the preorder demo, the sense of discovery when you come across that abandoned town and bunker is wonderful.  But unfortunately that's where it peaks. From there on out it's mostly pretty dull. I've been looking forward to the full release for a while now and I wanted so desperately to enjoy it. If the rest of the game was as interesting as the first few levels I could forgive all of its little faults, but unfortunately I found the rest of the game not necessarily BAD, but mostly disappointing.\n\nI bought this game for £8 from the humble store and I've gotten about 4 and a half hours out of it, excluding the time I spent on the pre-order demo. It had its good parts, and for that I don't regret purchasing it.\n\nMaybe you'll absolutely love it, I don't know, I'm not you. I'm not saying you shouldn't buy this, I just feel that someone needs to point out this game's issues so that they can be taken into consideration before you purchase it.\n\nTL;DR Lifeless Planet is a nice, pretty, atmospheric exploration game with an intriguing and original story--let down by excessive walking, lackluster gameplay and, at least on my hardware, unforgivable frame drops. If you have a tolerance for "walking simulators" then you may enjoy it. If not, steer clear.","June 6, 2014","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

But there was a few little things that very very light soured the experience.\n\nLong story: This game is wonderfully made, the enviroments are interesting and the levels are very complex, i do admit i did get myself lost a few times but i played this entire game in a single sitting and i do not regret it. It never felt like a chore, just a challange. The characters in this game were very well presented both the Astronaut and the Woman are very rich characters both with tragic backstories and it was brilliant to see them go through hardships and end up ok. The sound and level design is excllent, giving me a real sense of isolation and loneliness, as if i was on a real alien world. Puzzles were somewhat difficult later on but they became easy to grasp but once again, didn't feel tedious.\n\nThere are a couple bugs but nothing game breaking, a few times i have phased through the various elevators, bombs have ungodly wide blast radius but it's ok. and there was certain glitch the robotic arm but that was easily fixed. I suppose there could have been more voice acting but the PDA based back story and logs were just as good. The voice acting however rare it was, was still very well done.

The author says it is inspired, among others, in The Dig. The atmosphere recalls The Dig, but the gameplay does not. It is a platform game. There is a lot of jumping around, and the puzzles are much easier than the ones you fins in an adventure game.\n\nNevertheless, it is very enjoyable.

I have seen a lot of reviews saying that is it boring which I do not really agree with. It was not super action packed for very fast pace but it was enjoyable. I found myself at home with nothing to really do for an afternoon and this filled the void perfectly. It was a nice casual game I could play without having to think too hard really and hold my attention. Price wise $20 is maybe a bit much but whenever you see it pop up on sale I would definitely pick it up and try it. I loved the feeling of the planet and the enviroments felt large and looked amazing. The oxygen in the game seemed a little useless because I never ran into an issue where I needed it. Maybe if their was actually a timer going for it would add a little more pressure to the situation. All and all though I enjoyed the game and totally recommend anyone to play through it at least once.","July 20, 2014","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't think it would be worth the money for the full-priced game, but on special or as part of a bundle... sure. I grew up reading a lot of sci-fi, so I was expected more from the story to be honest. And there was really only one type of 'enemy' in the game with really long, slow levels. Seemed as though it was intentially designed to be tedious to get from point A to point B. And if you don't like jumping puzzles, this game is certainly not for you... about 95% of the puzzles consist of jumping from platform to platform. And if you miss one step, you have to start all the way back at the beginning again. Also, the textures in the game were recycled over and over again, so the environments got really old, really fast. Not as immersive as I was hoping for. Oh well, still an ok time waster if you want one. Start to finish is between 4 - 5 hrs.","July 21, 2014","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its fine though, because you're playing this to uncover the story. Each scrap of dialogue and each found note leaves you wanting to find the next.\n\nI would suggest waiting for a sale for this game due to its length.

Instead I had 6 hours of exploration and adventure while a story was slowly being untold. Lifeless Planet has much more gameplay than most walking simulators, with puzzles to solve and a lot of precision jumping. The game also sported a good sci fi story, though I would have loved a deeper story. Music was good and graphics were ok. I played using Xbox One controllers and the control felt great.

Was that really an indie game? I didn’t pay $60+ for that.”? Indie developers are showing us more and more that the value of gameplay doesn’t have to come with the high price tag of a AAA developer. Lifeless Planet, from Stage 2 Studios, gives us an action game that has no shooting things up, yet still feels like a decent platformer but for the fact that it’s 3D.\n\nIn Lifeless Planet, Earth has discovered a planet teeming with life that is close enough to warrant a manned one-way mission. Of course, like all good action games that involve travelling to another planet, you crash land. Here you get to discover the planet and uncover the mystery behind your missing crew and try to get home. Things start to go off the rails when you encounter an abandoned Russian town on this planet. It’s difficult to say to much more about the story as every little bit of info I encountered story wise would be a spoiler if I posted it here.\n\nLifeless Planet gives you a gorgeous 3D, on rails, platform game that plays very smoothly. The game pays good attention to the sense of atmosphere needed when traversing various levels, so you get a really great mix of beautiful vistas and foreboding darkened spaces. Lots of little data packets are spread throughout the levels to further the story, along with some basic puzzle solving and route solving. There is also a small mix of “Run! Or you’ll be splattered!” thrown in too, and this is done in the right spots of the game so as to not disturb the overall flow of gameplay. You spend the entire game confined to your spacesuit, which gives the developers a good reason to give you a jetpack. A jetpack? NO!, you scream. Rest assured, the jetpack is a one-burst item, and only a small burst at that. Occasionally, you do get a small temporary upgrade to the fuel source at various points and this allows you to discover some hidden sections on levels as well as make it across larger gaps or get to higher ledges. The use of the jetpack here has been done well, and it is easy to see that it is considered more of a tool to achieve small goals rather than a thing you must use at every point everywhere in the game ever.\n\nThere were some issues with using the jetpack, mainly though these where just control errors as both analog sticks on the controller will move the player and the camera too, so this lead to quite a few deaths and a couple of Steam Achievements. I think that if the camera control could be limited to one stick and the direction control to the other, this might smooth over some accidental deaths. While the game ran very smoothly for the most part for myself, on two occasions it slowed to a crawl for no reason that I could fathom and caused some frustration with the frame rate drop. The only way to resolve that was to stick the game to the lowest setting as any other setting caused the frame rate drop. The first time was a large power generator I need to start to open a gate and the second was getting the bridge working in a valley.\n\nLike most Steam games, this comes with a host of unlockable achievements, some of which you may decide not to do, like collecting all the data packets gives you the “Planetary Historian” achievement. The levels kind of hide some of these quite well so you will definitely miss all the data packets on the first run through. Whether you go back and collect all the achievements at the end of the game is up to you, but the problem there is that once you have completed Lifeless Planet, going back and collecting all the Steam achievements is not going to be fun, since you already know the story. My suggestion, if you want to collect them all, write the down first and then play the game and tick them all off as you go.\n\nI hope to see more from the developer of Lifeless Planet. Maybe even a sequel? Like I said, this is one of those rare gems that surprises you and I think it is definitely on my shortlist for Game of the Year. Lifeless Planet is also proof that not all Kickstarter funded games get delayed indefinitely, never made or are generally rubbish. Go get it and enjoy.","July 12, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are nice slow-paced exploration parts, thrilling quick-time events that dont overtake the screen (take note EA) and a nice little bit of scare factor too.\n\nOn the technical side, the timing, soundtrack, sound effects and graphics are all top notch!\n\nThe only complaint, if any, is that some of the puzzles are obviously easy, and while this might be an annoyance to me, I prefer hard puzzles.\n\nCompleted the whole game in about 3-4 hours.

You will find very few structures along your journey. The graphics are average, with only 3 maps standing out.  Unless you're an achievement buff and want to find a few mineral deposits, there is no real reason to go out of your way to explore the maps because .... there isn't anything there. Also, if you're an achievement buff, is not a good idea to explore on your first time. 1 achievement is a 4 hour playthrough on your first try. Problem is that, after you do this game 1 time, you won't do it a 2nd time. The puzzles are done. There isn't any more exploring you can do. Thus, the player effectively gets PUNISHED for exploring the 1st time out.\n\nAll the jumping puzzles are extremely easy to do, except for one jumping puzzle where its at night and visibility is nill. I LOVED that map and made sure to not have my brightness too high so I could enjoy the difficulty. Got lost :).\n\nThe story info dumps are interesting and not exactly overwhelming to read, so do so. For an $8k budget kickstarter game, this wasn't bad. I DID spend about 4  hours 15 minutes on the game proper (left the game on and did some things so it reads 5 hours on Steam). I think this is a $10 to $15 dollar game, not $19, but you have to be the judge of that.\n\nDo I recomend this game?

I feel like it could be a bit longer or make a second one and i also did not understand the whole story with the portals and stuff with the woman why she was able to control the roots and WHO she is but it sounds like she is the astronauts wife. I THINK THAT WHEN YOU GET BACK TO EARTH IN THE FUTURE IT IS NOT ACUALLY EARTH I THINK ITS MORE OF HALUCINATING ON THE ALIEN PLANET. Could you possibly email me a whole story of what the whole story is about because i didnt really get the whole thing so other than that it was a really cool game and i liked the parts with the extended jetpack and the odd storm thing that would chase you, what exactly is the storm and the root aliens?\n\ni give this game a 9 out of 10 because it could have been a bit longer and you could have given a bit more story that actually made sense.","June 9, 2014","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Talk about underrated game.\n\n4.5 hours of my evening just evaporated into this game. And I couldn't be more pleased.\n\nThis atmospheric puzzle platformer was an enchanting experience, mixed in with a subtle and absolutely sublime soundtrack. The narrative and method of telling the story kept me completely engrossed in the game, and left me pressing on until the eventual and rewarding end.\n\nOnly two puzzles out of the many actually had me stumped. I'll say this, I'm terrible at puzzle games, and this game does not hold your hand, however the puzzles become fairly intuitive as you press on. But beware the 'forest'.\n\nThe platforming and controls were quite solid, and one unique thing to note was the characters 'building up speed' as you continued to hold the directional button. Which is a mechanic you should familiarize yourself with, as it becomes important in a few of the platforming portions. There were maybe 3 platforming sections that irritated me, mostly because I didn't know which way to go, but one in particular was due to my inability to time my jumps. I don't fault the game for this at all.\n\nIf you have 4-5 hours that you want to spend having a unique and pleasing experience? Then buy this game.","June 28, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It took me about 4 hours to complete. This is a beautiful game, minus the "human" models and animations. This is not the prettiest game I have ever seen, but the devs obviously took the time to get it right. Atmosphere is the name of the game here; the sound effects are great, the music is fantastic. Voice acting is average. The experience was wonderful, creepy, and played to my inner conspiracy-theorist. I played with maxed-out settings (with an EVGA 760) and only encountered frame rate drops when confronted with scaffolding; a little confusing, as this is not a GPU-heavy game. However, there are elements in the game that seem almost like an after-thought; oxygen hunting, some of the puzzles. I did not get stuck on any of the puzzles, although I will say this; the platforming was weak. Not weak because it was so simple a 2 year-old could do it, but weak because the controls were not as responsive as they could have been. It almost seemed like there was an element of momentum to the jumping, but it did not always work. Sometimes I had to run in circles a bit before I took the running leap. That being said, I did not play with k/m. I used a gamepad to play, as it felt more natural in this case. I'm not sure if my troubles were because of my use of a gamepad, so I would not hold it against the devs.\n\nOverall; this was a 9/10.\nThese guys know how it's done. If you think that $20 is too much for a 4-6 hour experience, try to remember the last time you went to see an IMAX movie. How much did you spend? Maybe $20 - $30? That experience probably lasted only an hour and a half. There is a lot to be seen here, a lot to be admired. They did a fantastic job, and I hope they make more games.","June 8, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

None of them refer to the story, all to locations you visit in the game.\n\nI'm going to say outright that I believe this game is truly worth your time, despite the fact that I, personally, was not as interested in the story as I should have been. This is entirely my own personal preferences of storytelling, yet despite this, Lifeless Planet is a solid game.\n\nI purchased Lifeless Planet during the Early Access period and was quite interested in the plot of the game: as an American astronaut, you are traveling to a planet far, far from home. A one-way trip, in fact. Yet, somehow, there was human life already on this planet.\n\nDon't let the tag "walking simulator" put you off. Sure, there's a lot of walking. However, in addition, there are puzzle elements (quite simple, though at times a bit hard to detect as other elements not involved with the puzzle would catch me off-guard) as well as multiple stages of platforming that were for the most part enjoyable. There are also multiple occasions where you could die, as well as fail.\n\nThe game does have an air of an indie title to it, especially with the developer's constant changing and fixing of the game even after release. It's a sign of a great developer when they are willing to listen to glitches and bugs and actively interact with the fans to fix the problems. Kudos to you!\n\nThere are a few bits of the game that reflect in a bit of an unpolished experience, however. Mainly this is in consistency. At a certain point in the game, you realize a certain plant in the game will kill you when approached. However, a bit later in the game, there is a plant in the shape of a flower that can be jumped upon. Gamers would assume that these objects should be avoided due to past experiences, and I spent a long while trying to find alternate routes around the flower, only to find I could hop right on for a bit.\n\nAdditionally, areas in the game considered "safe" at times are not, and can kill you without much warning. A lava portion later in the game gave me a slightly frustrating amount of deaths, as I was incapable of knowing where I was allowed to go without bursting in flames. Certain areas lacking plant life would stab and maim me before I knew why. At other points, canyons and craters that I thought unaccessible were capable of being traveled upon, despite dying several times attempting to navigate previous large holes. If you go for achievements, know that doing so requires a lot of effort for several of them. They truly are "achievements".\n\nHOWEVER, the game is sound. The voice acting is terrific, particularly by our main astronaut. Russian voiceovers are realistic and well-done (though they do clash when reading English text-logs). As someone who does voice-acting, I found this area particularly strong, and I congratulate those involved. On top of this, the game does what it says it does. It tells a story. An engaging, interesting story.\n\nSure, there is a lot that could be looked into gameplay-wise, but for the most part, I doubt you're focusing on that. You're focusing on the tale it has to tell. You need to have a mindset of "I'm going to walk around quite a bit with some platforming, while listening to a story." There are long distances in this game. Long, barren distances. You need to get immersed to enjoy it. When you do, however, you truly experience a memorable game.\n\nTake a look into it! Perhaps it was not my cup of tea, but what I DO know is that I'm not the "almighty lord of good taste". You're in for an interesting experience, and it's definitely one of the most original ideas I've seen for a game in many months.","June 7, 2014","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The load speed of the game is amazing, all the while requiring little from the hardware.  The game while enjoyable is not as polished as you would expect for a final release.  I would consider it 'Alpha' quality.  The transition from area to area is often lacking physical continuity.  The music is well done, but needs more variety.   Obstacles and solutions seem placed directly in the player’s path & require little thought, which removes a level of depth from the game.  A frequent example of this is the jet pack charge-once it is depleted you know that all upcoming jumps will be small, removing a level of unknown from the player.\n\nCharacter development is crucial for the player to become immersed in the reality of this game.  Too much time is spent on the technology development, and too little on Aelita.  You have the opportunity to develop a sense of sympathy for the planet, but very little for Aletia.  It would have been endearing to see the two parallel each other.  There are also small glitches with the PDA and claw.  I hope to see more games in the future from this developer.  On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest rating, I would give it a 3.5.","June 8, 2014","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It, of course, has some problems but if you finish this game you will get a strange feeling and it's worth it.\n\nWhile playing the game I had some trouble while jumping and sometimes I got lost (Inferno level e.g.) but give it some time and you will find your way. Sometimes I couldn't activate the robo-arm (m-key); I had to press escape and resume the game to get it working; no idea what went wrong. You can get stuck between rocks as well; not the best experience but you can restart from the last checkpoint; no deal breaker.\n\nThe puzzles are very easy: there are basically 3 types of puzzles and if you figure them out, you can follow the game until the end. This isn't where the game shines to be honest.\n\nThe story is good; you start to think about it from the first second until the end of the game. It's well written and I generally like it. It leaves some open space at the end; that I like very much.\n\nMy main criticism is play time; the game is simply too short. I played other "short" games like "I Am Alive" which is a good one but I payed a lot less for "I Am Alive" but play time was a lot longer than with Lifeless Planet :/.\n\nBut overall I can say that this is a good game.

You will find very few structures along your journey. The graphics are average, with only 3 maps standing out.  Unless you're an achievement buff and want to find a few mineral deposits, there is no real reason to go out of your way to explore the maps because .... there isn't anything there. Also, if you're an achievement buff, is not a good idea to explore on your first time. 1 achievement is a 4 hour playthrough on your first try. Problem is that, after you do this game 1 time, you won't do it a 2nd time. The puzzles are done. There isn't any more exploring you can do. Thus, the player effectively gets PUNISHED for exploring the 1st time out.\n\nAll the jumping puzzles are extremely easy to do, except for one jumping puzzle where its at night and visibility is nill. I LOVED that map and made sure to not have my brightness too high so I could enjoy the difficulty. Got lost :).\n\nThe story info dumps are interesting and not exactly overwhelming to read, so do so. For an $8k budget kickstarter game, this wasn't bad. I DID spend about 4  hours 15 minutes on the game proper (left the game on and did some things so it reads 5 hours on Steam). I think this is a $10 to $15 dollar game, not $19, but you have to be the judge of that.\n\nDo I recomend this game? If you're an explorer, jumping puzzle fan (mostly explorer) I tentatively recomend it.

WHile I wouldn't necessarily recomend it at its current price, it is still a very good story for those fond of very outlandish oldschool sci-fi.\n\nThe only real complaint is the fact that it was blatantly not designed for Keyboard and Mouse primarily, in the fact that the camera will move based on the direction your character moves, always trying to face where they're moving. This isn't a massive issue, but it stands out nonetheless.\n\nTo avoid spoilers, there are segments in the game that require the usage of geysers to lift yourself upwards. They are very finnicky in how they want to work, and if they want to work. This can lead to about five to ten minutes woth of frustration, but I do not feel this ruins the overall experience.\n\nOverall I would give the game an honest 7/10. Reasoning being that the game was very short, though I do understand that this was a kickstarter project, along with other small issues. Otherwise, this game is excellent for those wanting to be immersed in an interesting sci-fi world that gets more and more interesting as you progress, giving a very classic sci-fi vibe in the meantime.","June 7, 2014","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story just became so addictive that I really couldnt put it down without finding out *all* the answers. If i'm honest, this game felt and played a lot like Portal 2. Between the mysticism of the woman and the wrecked terrain with a beautiful past, combined with the small collections of puzzles ( -which I *really* grew fond of) I really enjoyed just admiring the story that was presented to me.\n\nThe only thing I could nick at is that the wallpaper shown on a loading screen (the screen with the writing and mathematical equations) didnt really fit the story. "Three or Four crew?" really became redundant as after we'd met two of them and progressed far into the storyline.\n\nGenerally speaking, this is one of the best story-driven game i've played since Portal 2. I'm really happy with how it plays and functions as more of an experience than a game (which, contrary to some peoples opinion is OK!) and would love to see more games like this in the future.\n\n(Thanks for bringing my attention to this game, KurtJMac and YogscastSips!!)","June 7, 2014","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theneomaster/recommended/261530/","theneomaster","TFX | Neo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theneomaster/","368 products in account","Lifeless Planet is certainly a novel idea, and although this review is a "recommended" one, this game does have its issues, and to be honest I can't really say I RECOMMEND it right now. I just feel that anyone who sees the red thumbs down on a review for a game that they like will just instantly hate on it without seeing what it has to say. Overall, I have mixed feelings about it. This is a spoiler-free review, so please read on.\n\nI'm not going to say anything about the story, except that the ending felt really unsatisfying for me. Other than that, I enjoyed it, and it certainly is a memorable experience... but it's just one of those things that I feel would work better as a movie than a game, at least in its current form. There is SO much walking without much happening, so many jumping puzzles which are made extra annoying by the walking mechanics--which make you move FORWARDS a little upon pressing S, before turning around. This has made me fall off of the edges of things countless times. There are very few puzzles and gameplay elements in between the walking, which aren't paticularly challenging... just dull.\n\nAs for the graphics, they generally look a bit dated, but the skies and distant landscapes do look beautiful. The lighting isn't that bad either. However, I do seem to run into very random and inexplicable frame drops. (I have an i5-2500k and an AMD 7950.) Although this doesn't occur very often, one minute I can be getting 120FPS, the next it drops down to 15-30 in similar environments. Yes, I'm running on the highest settings, but my setup SHOULD be able to handle this game on the highest settings. The performance in this game is kind of unacceptable right now. Maybe it's something specific to AMD cards, who knows. I'm very disappointed with the performance in any case.\n\nNow, I love games about exploring desolate and abandoned things, such as in Portal 2 when you went though old aperture. That was honestly my favorite part of the game. Despite my frustration over the excessive walking and lackluster gameplay in Lifeless Planet, it managed to capture the same sort of atmosphere that made me enjoy the old aperture part of Portal 2.\n\nReally, whether I would recommend this game to you or not depends on your attitude towards "walking simulators." If you're one of the people who can tolerate Dear Esther, happy to just sit back and take in the pretty environments, then I'll hazard a guess to say that you will probably enjoy this game. If you dislike games where there is more walking than gameplay--in the case of Lifeless Planet, FAR more walking--then I would advise you to steer clear.\n\nTo clarify, I am someone who dislikes Dear Esther, but loves The Stanley Parable--in fact it's one of my favorite games of all time. So I don't necessarily mind games where there isn't much "gameplay", just ones where there is too much walking without anything particularly interesting happening. Which is sadly, at least in my view, the case for Lifeless Planet.\n\nI'd like to state that I enjoyed the preorder demo, the sense of discovery when you come across that abandoned town and bunker is wonderful.  But unfortunately that's where it peaks. From there on out it's mostly pretty dull. I've been looking forward to the full release for a while now and I wanted so desperately to enjoy it. If the rest of the game was as interesting as the first few levels I could forgive all of its little faults, but unfortunately I found the rest of the game not necessarily BAD, but mostly disappointing.\n\nI bought this game for £8 from the humble store and I've gotten about 4 and a half hours out of it, excluding the time I spent on the pre-order demo. It had its good parts, and for that I don't regret purchasing it.\n\nMaybe you'll absolutely love it, I don't know, I'm not you. I'm not saying you shouldn't buy this, I just feel that someone needs to point out this game's issues so that they can be taken into consideration before you purchase it.\n\nTL;DR Lifeless Planet is a nice, pretty, atmospheric exploration game with an intriguing and original story--let down by excessive walking, lackluster gameplay and, at least on my hardware, unforgivable frame drops. If you have a tolerance for "walking simulators" then you may enjoy it. If not, steer clear.","June 6, 2014","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

But there was a few little things that very very light soured the experience.\n\nLong story: This game is wonderfully made, the enviroments are interesting and the levels are very complex, i do admit i did get myself lost a few times but i played this entire game in a single sitting and i do not regret it. It never felt like a chore, just a challange. The characters in this game were very well presented both the Astronaut and the Woman are very rich characters both with tragic backstories and it was brilliant to see them go through hardships and end up ok. The sound and level design is excllent, giving me a real sense of isolation and loneliness, as if i was on a real alien world. Puzzles were somewhat difficult later on but they became easy to grasp but once again, didn't feel tedious.\n\nThere are a couple bugs but nothing game breaking, a few times i have phased through the various elevators, bombs have ungodly wide blast radius but it's ok. and there was certain glitch the robotic arm but that was easily fixed. I suppose there could have been more voice acting but the PDA based back story and logs were just as good. The voice acting however rare it was, was still very well done. I cared deeply for these characters and i had a very nice experience with this game. I would indeed recommend to anyone who enjots quiet and interesting games.","June 6, 2014","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I never got stuck not knowing what to do or where to go. I did however die a lot while exploring the world outside of the main path of the story. Falling to your death is not uncommon trying reach that place up there...\n\nThe changing of levels sometimes lacks any explanation on how you got to where you are. When one level ends it's night and when the next starts it's daylight. Some narrative on why would be a good thing.\n\nSome of the Achivements are pretty silly; Rocketeer (Finish the game in under 4 hours on your first playthrough), and Survivalist (Survive the game without dying on your first playthrough). To me those are now unachivable since I already finished the game once. The "on your first playthrough" part needs to go.\n\nThose small things set aside it's a pretty fun game with a good story that draws you in to it. I played it start to finish in only two sessions.

It's kinda Portal meets Shadow Of The Coloussus, lots of puzzle solving, platforming and exploration. There are also survial horror elements, but these only intrigue, and ultmately this game is more tense then scary. The game is full of clever twists, that I have never really encountered before. These twists are sort of similar to those of The Twilight Zone. While some would compare this to Dear Esther, this is far more engaging and mysterious, and while the graphics arent as good at that game, there is so much more depth to this. And you know, you can actually understand whats going on!\n\nThis game is not an action game, and I am concerned this game will be dismissed, because it does not have the fast pacing of COD or *insert AAA title here*.

It took me about 4 hours to complete. This is a beautiful game, minus the "human" models and animations. This is not the prettiest game I have ever seen, but the devs obviously took the time to get it right. Atmosphere is the name of the game here; the sound effects are great, the music is fantastic. Voice acting is average. The experience was wonderful, creepy, and played to my inner conspiracy-theorist. I played with maxed-out settings (with an EVGA 760) and only encountered frame rate drops when confronted with scaffolding; a little confusing, as this is not a GPU-heavy game. However, there are elements in the game that seem almost like an after-thought; oxygen hunting, some of the puzzles. I did not get stuck on any of the puzzles, although I will say this; the platforming was weak. Not weak because it was so simple a 2 year-old could do it, but weak because the controls were not as responsive as they could have been. It almost seemed like there was an element of momentum to the jumping, but it did not always work. Sometimes I had to run in circles a bit before I took the running leap. That being said, I did not play with k/m. I used a gamepad to play, as it felt more natural in this case. I'm not sure if my troubles were because of my use of a gamepad, so I would not hold it against the devs.\n\nOverall; this was a 9/10.\nThese guys know how it's done. If you think that $20 is too much for a 4-6 hour experience, try to remember the last time you went to see an IMAX movie. How much did you spend? Maybe $20 - $30? That experience probably lasted only an hour and a half. There is a lot to be seen here, a lot to be admired.

The load speed of the game is amazing, all the while requiring little from the hardware.  The game while enjoyable is not as polished as you would expect for a final release.  I would consider it 'Alpha' quality.  The transition from area to area is often lacking physical continuity.  The music is well done, but needs more variety.   Obstacles and solutions seem placed directly in the player’s path & require little thought, which removes a level of depth from the game.  A frequent example of this is the jet pack charge-once it is depleted you know that all upcoming jumps will be small, removing a level of unknown from the player.\n\nCharacter development is crucial for the player to become immersed in the reality of this game.  Too much time is spent on the technology development, and too little on Aelita.  You have the opportunity to develop a sense of sympathy for the planet, but very little for Aletia.  It would have been endearing to see the two parallel each other.  There are also small glitches with the PDA and claw.  I hope to see more games in the future from this developer.

Sometimes I couldn't activate the robo-arm (m-key); I had to press escape and resume the game to get it working; no idea what went wrong. You can get stuck between rocks as well; not the best experience but you can restart from the last checkpoint; no deal breaker.\n\nThe puzzles are very easy: there are basically 3 types of puzzles and if you figure them out, you can follow the game until the end. This isn't where the game shines to be honest.\n\nThe story is good; you start to think about it from the first second until the end of the game. It's well written and I generally like it. It leaves some open space at the end; that I like very much.\n\nMy main criticism is play time; the game is simply too short. I played other "short" games like "I Am Alive" which is a good one but I payed a lot less for "I Am Alive" but play time was a lot longer than with Lifeless Planet :/.\n\nBut overall I can say that this is a good game. I enjoyed it.","June 8, 2014","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only explosions created are from natural rock slides and the few coincidences where you need dynamite to progress through the story.   I liked the fact that the creators managed to enable the use of controllers, but the controls were a bit iffy.   The story itself was very interesting and was probably the only thing keeping me from turning off my computer.   That said, you shouldn't expect this to be a huge RPG top seller, but I'll give it a 7/10 for it being what it is.","June 8, 2014","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You will find very few structures along your journey. The graphics are average, with only 3 maps standing out.  Unless you're an achievement buff and want to find a few mineral deposits, there is no real reason to go out of your way to explore the maps because .... there isn't anything there. Also, if you're an achievement buff, is not a good idea to explore on your first time. 1 achievement is a 4 hour playthrough on your first try. Problem is that, after you do this game 1 time, you won't do it a 2nd time. The puzzles are done. There isn't any more exploring you can do. Thus, the player effectively gets PUNISHED for exploring the 1st time out.\n\nAll the jumping puzzles are extremely easy to do, except for one jumping puzzle where its at night and visibility is nill. I LOVED that map and made sure to not have my brightness too high so I could enjoy the difficulty. Got lost :).\n\nThe story info dumps are interesting and not exactly overwhelming to read, so do so. For an $8k budget kickstarter game, this wasn't bad. I DID spend about 4  hours 15 minutes on the game proper (left the game on and did some things so it reads 5 hours on Steam). I think this is a $10 to $15 dollar game, not $19, but you have to be the judge of that.\n\nDo I recomend this game? If you're an explorer, jumping puzzle fan (mostly explorer) I tentatively recomend it. Though, as I said, you probably won't play it twice.","June 8, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The chartacter graphics arent anything to write home about, but the surroundings are great in most cases....and come on you have a bloody Jet pack, all games get points for throwing that in.\n\nHowever if your willing to pay this for the game, go for it, its a quick fun game to enjoy, although I was really hoping for allot more out of this game.","June 7, 2014","true","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story just became so addictive that I really couldnt put it down without finding out *all* the answers. If i'm honest, this game felt and played a lot like Portal 2. Between the mysticism of the woman and the wrecked terrain with a beautiful past, combined with the small collections of puzzles ( -which I *really* grew fond of) I really enjoyed just admiring the story that was presented to me.\n\nThe only thing I could nick at is that the wallpaper shown on a loading screen (the screen with the writing and mathematical equations) didnt really fit the story. "Three or Four crew?" really became redundant as after we'd met two of them and progressed far into the storyline.\n\nGenerally speaking, this is one of the best story-driven game i've played since Portal 2. I'm really happy with how it plays and functions as more of an experience than a game (which, contrary to some peoples opinion is OK!) and would love to see more games like this in the future.\n\n(Thanks for bringing my attention to this game, KurtJMac and YogscastSips!!)","June 7, 2014","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That said, it doesn't detract from what the game is. It's about 4 hours long and is incredibly atmospheric.\n\nIt is basically a "follow a path and do a few jump puzzles sequences" game. Every now and then there is a small puzzle to get through. There isn't a ton to it, but what is there is just fantastic. You will want to play this game for the atmosphere alone. The music is really great and fitting. The story is somewhat interesting. Interesting enough to pay attention to it. And though the name of the game isn't really acurate, it does still give a sense of loneliness.\n\nThe one thing I don't like is the achievements. A few of them are "do such and such on your first play through". If you don't look at the achievements before playing the game, you will have no clue that you need to accomplish these things on your first playthrough, and so after you screw up once on your first playthrough, you can never get the achievement then? That's not cool. "Don't die on your first playthrough." You die once, you can never get the achievement? That's just dumb.\n\nBut that's an incredibly small gripe that doesn't actually have anything to do with the gameplay.

The only way out was restoring form the last checkpoint. The arm object has problems for example picking up the green stone does not work and needs to be improved. The jumping and jetpack mechanics work well and easy to use. The environment is good great sense of space throughtout the environment. The voice overs and text is well done and keeps the player updated and informed about the world and how to use certain things.

Wait for it to go on sale, then buy it.\n\n*Spoiler Free Review*\n\nThis is firmly an adventure game, and it uses its horror well.  You never have a way to fight back against the dangers of the planet, which works in the game's favor.  I was on edge the whole time, examining my path carefully to avoid dying horribly.  The game does host invisible walls, but with one or two exceptions, I never encountered them, focused on not being killed by the enemies lurking about.  To further play up the horror, you occasionally hallucinate through the game, which left me frequently wondering if what I just saw was real.\n\nThe mystery of the first half of the game was phenomenal, as was the revelation of the planet's history, but this actually wound up working against the game.  The ending left me unsatisfied, and the twist revealed by the final document was disappointing.  I felt that it verged on pulling the game from Sci-fi to Fantasy, and after all that build up, it was a real let down.\n\nAs you travel, there are set points where your jetpack fuel will run out (limiting you to just one boost, down from seven), as will your oxygen.  The oxygen is done to show passage of time, as well as to play into the story, and the jetpack fuel is done to present new platforming challenges, but both came off as contrived and pulled me out of the experience each time it happened.\n\nThe controls work well on keyboard or controller, though a little bit more air maneuverability would have been nice.  Most of the puzzles are just a matter of finding the right object to drop into a hole, and the rest are figuring out a button sequence, but that's fine.  This isn't a puzzle game foremost, this is an exploration game.  The fact that the dev managed to make a linear exploration game not feel linear speaks volumes to his skill.\n\nThe graphics leave much to be desired, but so long as you're looking at the surroundings, it works fine.  It's when you're looking at a facial expression that it becomes jarring.  Faces here always seem to be either neutral expression or vaguely malevolent, which makes the protagonist's description of what they were supposed to be expressing seem canned and insincere.\n\nI didn't get attached to the characters at all, and I can't help but think that had the protagonist's personal story been left out and the player been left to project on the character, the game would have been improved.  Without spoiling anything not already spoiled in the description, the mysterious woman had little personality.  Several scenes were thrown in to make me feel for her, and while one or two did make me feel horrified or confused as intended, I never managed an attachment.\n\nThe level design is done quite well, though the transitions need a LOT of work.  Frequently a new level would start, I'd turn around and sit there wondering how in the hell I got here.  A few levels also felt that they were put in just to have them.  The fire level, or the hot springs level, for example.  The level in the volcanic area in particular was frustrating, as the game became one of guess and check to figure out which ledges were safe to land on, and which would kill you instantly.  A few times there were even invisible walls mid-air that would do the same.  Fortunately, the death system is done very well, or I likely would have stopped there in frustration.\n\nOverall, this is a good game, and it made me stay up far later than I should have to finish it.  A good story until the end, and I look forward to see more of the Dev's work in the future.  However, between the graphics, short run time (I finished it in ~4.5 hours), and lack of replayability, I don't feel it was worth the price of admission.","June 9, 2014","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is purely aethestic, and is no way meant to be combat-based. The game takes you, an unamed widow of a man, through an alien world where the Russians have somehow gotten to and destroyed the place (Yeah, go figure, the Russians ruined everything). Stranded and with an oxygen leak in your suit, you set out aimlessly for reasons unknown, probably because you have nothing better to do. The game's storyline is "Iffy" to say the least, the gameplay is boring and repetative... But that's the point. It's an art game. You enjoy the scenery. Believe me, as far as art games go, this is one of the best I've ever played. It's a lot like Journey, there's good music and good environment but it's really sandy and you just kind of do the same thing forever. Long story short, if you want an action game, don't buy this, if you want an art game that's about appreciating the long hard hours it took to but this absolutely stunning landscape together, then go on ahead.

An American Astronaut lands on a planet 30 light years from earth, only to discover that not only did the Soviet beat them there, but that they've all mysteriously disappeared...\n\nAnd so begins what is probably the best 'Walking Simulator' I've played in the last three years, and all the usual suspects of the genre are here; diary entries, simple puzzles, no enemies, and most importantly, an atmosphere so thick and intoxicating that it just makes the games many flaws all that more tragic.  The majority of the games 'walking' involves linear pathways with simplistic jumping challenges and the occasional 'put the battery in the battery slot' puzzle, while gravity and vegetation serve as the games biggest threats.  It's certainly more involved than the other mascots of the genre, like Gone Home and Dear Ester.\n\nThe graphics in particular deserve attention.  Specifically, they're terrible.  Even while playing on the highest graphical settings it felt like I was playing a game from the middle of the PS2 era.  Hope you like your worlds full of terrain morphing, because that's what you're getting, texture stretching on cliffs and all.  This plain geology is broken up with some simple rock models here and there, but it's no where near enough to fix how bland some environments feel.  The man-made structures are a mixed bag.  The simple utilitarian houses are well modelled and fit the theme well, while the larger structures are blocky and kind of silly looking.  The character models are also horrendous, and have such a cheap, low quality appearance.\n\nThe games plot is also a bit of a mixed bag.  Earlier parts of the game sprinkle bits of character back-story on you, before deciding the to leave that arc alone until the end game.  In fact, so many plot points occur in the opening segments of the game that a lot of the middle section simply feels like filler.  On the other hand, this 'quiet' gives the game, and the player, a chance to take in the scenery, and with a full play through lasting three and a half hours, it's not that big a deal.\n\nEven with the visual and story pacing issues, I found Lifeless Planet to be a generally pleasurable experience.  It's aura of mystery and discovery kept me interested enough to see it to the end.  That said, it's a bit steep at $20, so you're better off waiting for a sale or bundle deal.","October 11, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Of course, this is what makes it all the more endearing. The premise is instantly appealing and the ability to just wander this strange, seemingly lifeless world and its mysteries is fun. It's always linear, but the open spaces (compared to your little astronaut chappie) are vast, and rarely do you feel funnelled. Maxed out, it's also rather pretty, with a neat DOF effect and the only decent film grain I've ever seen in a game. The most exciting weapon you find is an extendable arm - woo-hoo, I hear you cry - but LP is a game that reminds you of the simple joys of the gaming days of yore, such that every opportunity to use said arm, brought a little cheer to my heart. Oh mechanical arm (thought I), how I long to reward you for your reachy-button-pressing and green-rock-thing-lifting by taking you back to earth in place of my missing wife. It also has a functional jetpack, which is 5/10 straight out of the box.\n\nOverall, while some may find this a little empty, dwell on the title and you may realise your error. It looks nice, has great sound design, solid controls, great variety of areas and a story which reveals itself over 3-4 hours as you explore firsthand and discover the relics on the planet, rather than being battered by hours of cut scenes and terrible dialogue. It's something of a cross between Dear Esther, LucasArts' The Dig and classic 2D platformer Another World. LP may not be very challenging, but it has charm and immersion, and you really feel for the lonely little astronaut chappie. Is he the first to visit this world? Is the planet really lifeless and, if not, do you get a refund? Is his story real or just lovesick hallucination?

However, I never really got sucked into the story the way I did with 'Ethan Carter', 'Dragon Age' or even 'Darksiders'.

The controls are a bit awkward, you can't strafe, but rather turn in a circle.  The levels are designed with extremely clear paths for you to take.  There are almost no puzzles in the game.  The only puzzles that really exist are jumping puzzles, and that's pretty much the only mechanic.  So if you like Parkour games in Minecraft, you'll love this game, but otherwise you'll find it extremely frustrating.  The terrain is also poorly designed.  There are many places where I just got stuck because the models were just a little too steep in an unsuspecting place.\n\nThigs in the game are either extremely easy or extremely frustrating.  I don't mind challenging or frustrating games, but when 90% of the game is as easy as following the path, when it finally tries to give you a challenge that is above average in it's level of difficulty, it's extremely frustrating.  Lastly, some things are just kinda broken.  Most recently, I went up an elevator, realized I had to go back down to find something.  On the elvator ride back down, I decided to jump off to save time.  However, when I jumped off the elevator it stopped where it was at!  There was no way for me to get back up.  I couldn't reach it.  And "intentionally" the call button is broken.  So i've had to quit the game.  I hope when I restart the problem fixes itself.\n\nFrustration aside, the story is very intriguing.  I'm still very interested in seeing how this story resolves.  That said, the frequency of details begins to drop off dramatically the more you play the game.  It's nice to be left in the dark for awhile so you can try to piece things together yourself, but the developers have defnitely not mastered the art of witholding information.  If you withold too much your audience will be confused or bored.  If the gameplay was more creative and challenging (in a good, well thought out way) I would forgive the major pauses in story progression.

Buildings and houses  in this game resemble something you would see in a dreamcast game.\n\nTo be fair i enjoyed the story and thought the ending was ok, but the pacing and the delivery of the plot was awful. and the transitioning between levels was so laughable bad, prolly the worst i have EVER SEEEN IN A GAME. It made it feel really unfinished. Your just walking along when the screen goes black with no sound, next thing you know your in a totally different area on yet another narrow path.\n\nVoice acting wasn't good either. felt cheap. Although i did enjoy the soundtrack, and they didnt over use it thank god.\n\nI really wanted to like this. and the only reason i beat it was because of how much i spent on it. Its been a day since i played/beat this game and i can vaguely even remember anything about it,  nothing stood out and made it memorable. There were no "Wow" moments.  Even if you buy this on sale be prepared for a repetitive, boring journey through what looks like an old dreamcast game with high res textures.(Not that there is anything wrong with old games, but you know what i mean)","February 11, 2015","false","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedeww/recommended/261530/","thedeww","PorkRub","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedeww/","500 products in account","I bought this game on Steam because the premise intrigued me. Loading up the game had me crash land on a strange alien world. The first thing that struck me while playing, was how generic the animations looked. Then how plain the landscape looked. It never got much better. I do realize it is an indie game, but I have seen better from indie devs. The overblurring of everything just struck me as lazy.\nThe story was not as good as I would have hoped. The small tidbits of information you find around the world as you explore are enough to keep you going, but ultimately it isn't enough. The developer may have thought so as well, as there is a very loose story about the main characters wife thrown in there. I cared more about the history of the planet, and who/what is on it than a character that I was never introduced to in the first place.\nWith the amount of jumping puzzles in the game, the mechanics are decently done. However I had problems trying to get my character to turn around without running in a half circle and walking off small platforms. This mechanic if you were running could be explaned with forward momentum, but it happens while standing still which creates an artificial difficulty with some of the jumps. Otherwise the game does a good job of holding your hand at the beginning as less as you go on. Where you need to go isn't clearly defined, but I found myself instinctually heading the right way.\nOverall the game wasn't terrible, but I was expecting alot more. the zones and graphics felt too recycled for me. I finished it (barely) in under four hours, and that felt like a good time to stop it. It might be worth buying on a Steam sale, but if you are expecting Gone Home on an alien planet, you aren't going to find it here.","March 19, 2015","false","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's interesting in the same way the "mystery box" of horror or suspense is, and offers some interesting thoughts. I'd love to see more support for indy games, but...\n\nOn the other hand, the game failes to follow through on those interesting thoughts. The platforming and controls are absurdedly weak for a game that relies on it. The movement, jetpacking, and other actions get old really fast, and this is for a game that boasts an achievement for completing the game in less than 4 hours on the first playthough. Half the puzzles are exactly the same as previous puzzles, and the other half feel inane and time-wasting. The protaganist is hardly there; rather than telling a story about his wife (as hinted at in the trailer), it becomes the story by lack of any competion, as we learn nothing about her besides her death and his nihlism; he leaves two crewmembers dead without a backward glance, ignoring a story about loss and space (especially in the context of a one-way journey where they likely expected to learn, live, and die together); he ends up following a ridiculously slow genetically altered Russian without ever discovering a way to talk with her and prompt any kind of story.\n\nIn all, the game could be worthwhile as part of a bundle (Yay Humble Bundle!) but terrible as an individual game. maybe 1.5/5 stars. Watch the videos on YouTube if you want to learn the "story"; GameKiller346 posted 8 videos that cover the whole thing.","January 24, 2015","false","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I could highlight New Game, but was unable to access the Options menu. After playing the game for a little bit, I would go to the menu and was unable to access the "Save & Quit" option. I basically had to just wait until I got to a save point and then Ctrl+Alt+Delete to the Task Manager and End Task to quit the game... This was only the beginning.\n\nGame Mechanics were a big issue for me, which makes it even more problematic knowing that this is a platformer from start to finish. Timing the jumps is part of the game, but basically missing a jump means dying and dying means restarting, A LOT. But then there are other problems with the game mechanics. There is a part where you have to use geysers to jump from place to place. Although, I was finally able to get through it (simply by luck), I was never able to figure out how the mechanic actually worked to make it happen. Basically, I just kept pushing buttons and after 50 attempts, I'd finally make it. Additional problems are that this was an obvious port from X-Box (still had places to push X or Y buttons), that was badly adapted to a keyboard and mouse. Finally, there were levels that I was able to complete without doing (what I would think are) necessary actibities.  Don't want to spoil the game, but in multiple levels there are these huge machines to turn on to get from one point to another. I went explorting before doing this and managed to reach the end of the level. This is just poor level design. In a game that is all about exploring, I should be able to explore myself out of a level without doing crucial steps.\n\nThe puzzles were a bit interesting. The problem was that they were generally the same puzzles time after time after time with very little variation between them. This almost seemed like cheating to me. Pick up stone, use it to power a machine. Walk for five minutes, pick up stone, use it to power another machine. Rinse, lather, repeat about 20 times. Opening doors? Find a code from six buttons. Next door? Same 6 buttons but in a different order. Next door? Guess what? Same 6 buttons but in a different order. This same puzzle for about 6-8 doors.\n\nThe most annoying part of the game was all the pointless dying. There were areas where it is difficult to tell where you could and could not go, but if you went to a area you were not supposed to go to, you died. Restart. One level (without giving too much away) sees the player navigating through volcanic activity. This level took me a good 30-45 minutes to navigate because I could not tell what was going to kill me and what wouldn't kill me. By the time I finally got through it, I was so frustrated, I wanted to delete the game. Another part of the game involves plants killing you by coming out of the ground and there was no telling (other than dying) where some of them would appear from. It got annoying because I was frequently not even close to a clump of plants, but still managed to die by getting spiked. Restart.\n\nThe story was somewhat interesting. It was the only thing that made me play through the game to the finish. However, it was so anti-climactic that I was disappointed when I finally finished it. Not even the world made want to keep gonig. I did not really find myself once thinking, I wonder what's around that corner, but wondered many times, what is THAT supposed to be? There was one level that (I think) had a glacier or ice on it, but it was so poorly implemented I don't know what it was. The biggest problem with the landscape development was that the rocky outcroppings and "boundaries" of the level were supposed to be stone, but looked smooth instead of rough and rock-like.\n\nWas it worth $20.00? Not even close. It took me roughly 6 hours to win the game and with all the problems described above, I'm not sure I'd really even pay $5.00 for the game. Maybe $1.99 if I had a free afternoon on a random Satruday. The only reason this did not get a 1/10 is because there weren't any game breaking bugs nor anytime the game crashed to desktop. So at least they got that right.","January 17, 2015","false","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game DOES support using the cursor keys to control your character, but DOES NOT support remapping any of the other keys. The need to combine the space key for jumping with camera control by left-handed mouse and cursor keys for movement is so awkward that this game becomes unplayable, considering that it requires very precise jumping.\n\nToo bad, because I was really interested in experiencing this game's story.\n\nI really do not understand why developers are willing to spend so much time on developing a game and then do not allow key remapping, which is quite easy to implement.

I wasn't sure whether it would be worth the money or not. I read a couple really good reviews though, and the game was on sale, so I took it. Gotta say, it was a really good impulse buy. Very worth it.\n\nThe game's atmosphere felt really mysterious, sometimes even a little creepy, and the planet was absolutely gorgeous (even being lifeless as it is). The game's more challenging sections were well spaced apart and even the "more challenging sections" as I am describing them, are not TOO challenging. You're never overwhelmed with super challenging obstacles or puzzles, but sometimes the game does make you think quite a bit.\n\nNow, every now and then you might find yourself wandering in circles, unsure of how to progress, but don't give up! The game is actually not that hard, and you just have to walk around for a bit and find out what you're supposed to do. And believe me, once you find out what to do, you may or may not smack yourself in the face and say "how did I not realize that I was supposed to do that?" or "that was there the whole time?!"\n\nAs far as dying in the game: yes, you can. I won't say how, but you can die, yes. So be prepared for a lot of parts where you're trying to avoid dying by... whatever it is that can kill you (no spoilers :3 except fall damage. I will say you can die by falling. It's also in this game's achievement list to do just that, so...).\n\nOverall, this game was absolutely fantastic. I don't know if I would buy it for $19.99 because really it's only roughly 3-5 hours of gameplay average (I beat it in just under 4 hours, even with getting stuck at a few parts and wandering around for minutes trying to find out what to do to progress) and is really only good for one playthrough I think, but I got it on sale for $9.99 and I think that was a good price for it. I say it's only good for one playthrough because once you know what's going on, you've read the documents along the way, and you finish the game, that's kinda just it. There's not too much reason to play it again, unless you want to search every inch of the game for all the hidden science-y samples you can collect, if that's your thing. I guess if you miss out on the Rocketeer achievement you may want to play again without reading the documents so you can beat the game faster (you have to beat it in under 4 hours to get that achievement) but other than just getting the achievements for sh*ts and giggles, I think one playthrough is enough to satisfy your needs.\n\nHowever, don't think that you shouldn't get the game just for that reason. That one playthrough, for me, was a true adventure, and one of the most fun experiences I've ever had with gaming. I haven't played a game like this one in forever, and I really really enjoyed every step of my journey, which truly felt like an immersive journey.\n\nThat's really all I have to say about this game. Basic rundown: The planet was absolutely gorgeous, I loved the scenery, the challenges aren't TOO challenging, you may get lost but don't give up, and the backstory was very interesting (READ THE DOCUMENTS! DON'T YOU DARE SKIP OVER THEM! I WILL FIND YOU AND MOO IN YOUR FACE VERY OBNOXIOUSLY IF YOU DO!)\n\nOverall: 10/10 stars. Just yes. I really had a lot of fun on my journey. I recorded a video for YouTube and will add the link to my review soon, but I have to edit and upload it still, so my playthrough isn't up there just yet, but it will be, once I get around to it.","January 13","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The Russians are at it again. ...Or is it were?\n\nLifeless Planet. What do I think about it? Honestly, it was a nice break from the usual shoot 'em ups and strategy games. The world you explore is beautiful, and it certainly has an open feel to it. There is some areas in which you can veer from the path the game leaves for you, but those times are limited. The puzzles in Lifeless Planet are pretty pathetic, it must be said, but don't let that ruin the game for you. I didn't let it, however, the animation... Wow. Is there even any real animation? I won't say any more in fear of giving something away, so I'll move on to the plot.\n\nOf course here I can't say too much, but I will say I was a bit dissapointed at the end. I was certainly expecting something more. When you happen upon the town the Russian settlers used to live in, it adds this aura of mystery and tension that I liked, which then disappeared as the plot progressed.\n\nSo with all this negativity, you must be wondering why I'm bothering to recommend this to you. Even with all its flaws, Lifeless Planet was an enjoyable game. It must be looked at as what it is, and that is an atmospheric game. The planet itself is amazing, and is extremely fun to explore. The mood of the game changes with your surroundings, and the change is often and welcome. Pieces of the story are scattered around the planet as well, and there is a certain glee in finding the ones you know could be easily missed, and slowly being able to piece together what happened to this strange new world.\n\nOverall I would give this a 8/10, a game that is a great break from the norm, but has its fair share of flaws.","December 29, 2014","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That’s a tremendous amount of work considering, that it’s a 6-hour game.\n\nGameplay\nIt’s a very-very-VERY simple game, more like a simulator where you control this little man in a space suit. He moves around and jumps, on occasions interacts with simple objects and that’s about it. It doesn’t have much of a character. He does comment on his surroundings at times and reads some documents that he finds but it’s nothing close to a fully developed character to have a bond with.\nThe game itself is noticeably uneven, being exciting and tight in the beginning and getting more and more stretched out, unoriginal as you progress. About half-way through the game I started to feel impatience when again I saw some long distances that had to be covered just for the sake of winning playtime. The last chapters felt plain empty to say the least.\nI also felt that so-familiar irritation that bug games like Alice: Madness Returns – you know the time when you have to jump from one ledge to another but the normal jump is too short whereas the double jump leaps you way over it and into the abyss below. Be ready to swallow a decent amount of this.\nOther than that it’s working, doesn’t crash and if taken as it is – a simple game, then you won’t be disappointed.\n\nDesign\nThe game felt like Kairo. It could have been named ‘Kairo 2’ or ‘Before Kairo’ or something. This means that the environment felt very artificial and made of elements that don’t blend so well with each other. Now, that might be a good thing. This way you can create a game that feels abstract and Lifeless Planet, despite of it’s realistic setting de jure, felt abstract. The elements felt unnatural and out of place, think of it as Dadaism or postmodernism in art. In Lifeless Planet this conflict felt deliberate.\n\nEverybody knows what a lifeless planet looks like, right? It’s a barren wasteland of sand and craters. The game starts out with the common idea of such a planet but how long can you show this before the player tires? No long. So, in every new chapter the design does get a little more daring, yes still trying to hold on to a sane image of a wasted planet and it was curious and funny to observe how the designer gave in to more and more of absurdities until it became a complete fantastical vista. This makes you give credit to games like Borderlands and Rage, which managed to hold it together.\n\nIf you happen to have played with Unity’s terrain creator then you will get some flashbacks from the kitchen side of game development. I never noticed that in a game before and can’t say that I liked it. It felt like seeing the first clumsy experiments of a digital painter who tries out Photoshop’s default brushes.\n\nVerdict\nAfter all the whining and complaining I still recommend the game. Why? Because it felt chill and because then you know what one person with little help is able to create. Most of all I disliked the running around but everything else I’m ready to accept. I have far deeper issues with games from bigger companies.\n","January 14, 2015","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't let the deceptively austere environment fool you - there is a high amount of detail and the atmosphere helps build the mysteriousness of the story. As for audio, music is sparse - in a good way. The tracks build slowly and help illuminate the progress you've made.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dronak/recommended/261530/","dronak","Dronak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dronak/","2192 products in account","Overall, I thought this was a pretty good game.  You play an astronaut exploring a planet, but it's pretty linear -- for the most part, you're following a relatively fixed path and having to solve a few puzzles along the way to progress.  The story is kind of interesting, but there didn't seem to be a whole lot of it; there's enough to keep things moving, but it's told in small pieces with longer stretches of silence (well, environmental sounds) in between.  It took me around 9-10 hours to get through the game, looking up some info/hints when I got stuck in a few places, and generally not too difficult.  But around the middle of the game, one sequence of ~7 jumps in a row had me stuck for a long time (easily 30+ minutes of play time).  I knew what to do, but had a lot of trouble actually doing it and that really annoyed me.  That could just be me and my game-playing skills, but that part really disrupted my enjoyment of the game.  I eventually got past it and finished the game, but it just wasn't quite the same after that point.  I was a little disappointed to find out that I had missed some things along the way (I still hadn't earned some achievements), and you only get a single save point that's automatically determined by the game as you go, so I'd have to start all over again from the beginning again if I wanted to look for what I missed.  Yes, there's some replay value here, but having seen the story and everything once already, I'm not sure I'd enjoy it as much when I'd really just be looking to find some missing pieces / get some achievements.  Also note that once you finish the game, it's impossible to "resume game" from the main menu; it just crashes.  I was hoping to go back and see the ending bit again, but I'd have to play the whole game again now to do so.  :(  So as I said at the start, I think this game is good overall, and would recommend it if it sounds interesting to you or you generally like games of this type.","November 1, 2014","true","9.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

To hell with those outdated graphics, but the game is not even optimized properly. I played it on my laptop whch runs Far Cry 3 with at least 30 FPS. But somehow my laptop was struggling with Lifeless Planet and the framerate was sometimes dropping below 20. You can choose the graphics quality from "Fastest" to "Fantastic", but there was no significant difference, so I kept it on lowest settings.\n\nBut what about gameplay? Well, there we go. At the beginning it got me intrigued with the story so I kept playing, but as you go deeper into the game it turns out to be a platformer with poor (or lazy?) level design. And the plot turns into some kind of low budget sci-fi that you don't even have to bother about, because to most of it you have to read from the notes found around.\n\nAlso the controls are not sharp, therefore there are some platforming you will repeat over and over due to that issue until you get it right. Otherwise it's just walking through a tunneled and long paths that are just boring. That's also because the character you control is slow and runs like he ♥♥♥♥ himself in his spacesuit.\n\nThere are puzzles too, but they're not very challenging and won't take you longer than couple minutes to figure out and are usually repetetive, so all you'll have to focus on is to where to find the objects needed to solve the riddle.\n\nI guess somebody was too ambitious with making an indie game.

The game generates great views of the planet landschafts, which change from chapter to chapter not allowing your get bored. I can agree with other reviewers that puzzles are rather simplistic and not much of a challenge, but that's not the point really. One thing was actually bugging me through the most of the game - rewards for exploration. The game start off with a promise that exploring every corner and small hidden pathways would bring a reward in a form of found samples or artifacts with a small explanation or story behind. This puts you in a mood of explorer initially, but the game subsequently fails to deliver on this promise. After 3rd chapter I believe, I couldn't find a single sample, note or artifact anywhere no matter how hard I was looking around, I was finding perfect places to hide such things with zero result. This really puts you off and exploring becomes a joke. Add to this a completely linear gameplay and you'll understand why there are no many bad reviews. There are invisible walls around areas and in some cases camera would just stop following you so you can not go further. Really? Isn't it so impossible hard to put some "natural" walls or cliffs or something that prevent me from going further instead invisible walls that I really hate in games.\n\nIn any case, this game could be absolutely awesome if there would be more freedom, more exploration, more elaborate storyline, more "unknown" (even not related to the main story line, man we are on alien planet!) to explore and study. Something like a soil scanner would cool to have to investigate surrounding areas in search for clues. Nevertheless I really enjoyed this game with all its drawbacks, so thumbs up! Hope the next game from this studio will deliver a deeper experience, lots of promise here!","February 22","true","12.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

In terms of gameplay, this is very decidedly a third person platformer. You'll be hopping from surface to surface, sometimes making mistakes, sometimes dying. You will jetpack. You'll roll rocks. You'll use a hydraulic manipulation arm. You'll solve some simple puzzles. And yes, you'll walk and look and listen, so it has a bit of the "walking simulator" in it, but it's very much a game with game mechanics.\n\nThe Steam description for the game already tells some details from the story so I won't worry about spoiling: you're an astronaut exploring a lifeless planet, yet finding remnants of a Soviet base, and then a figure in the distance who might be friend or foe.\n\nThe game's backstory is told in bits and pieces, as you travel through setpieces on this foreboding planet. There are themes of fear, sadness, hubris, and exploitation.\n\nIt's a lower budget game, evident from the models, the terrain, the quality of the cutscenes and animations. And I think they did an excellent job working within these constraints. Even with these limits, the game manages to be engrossing, even creepy at times.\n\nWhat I enjoyed\nWhile it's mostly forbidding Mars-like terrain, there's a wide variety of locations.\nThe music and voice acting, top notch. The music is especially marvellous: brooding, melancholy violins and cellos, and the occasional sci-fi synth, do much to set the mood. The voices, while few in numbers, are just as engaging. The voice journals left behind (yes yes, that tired narrative device; personally I never really minded it) are in Russian and help immerse you more into what happened to the colonists that left them.\nA few simple mechanics add some flavour to the otherwise simplistic platforming gameplay. Most of all I like the extended jetpacking that lets you cross wide chasms.\nIt's linear from start to finish, but there are a few collectibles to find if you wander off the beaten path.What I didn't like\nA couple of spots have fiddly platforming. Very few though.\nOne area of the game, towards the end, is rather tedious. Not only are you walking up thin walkways and jumping from one to the other, you're doing it in the dark. Thankfully, it ends before dragging on too long.\nSome strange lack of transitions between scenes. I get the feeling there were some cutscenes that never got made, or simply that the developers had no idea how to link the two areas. Can be abrupt and jarring. I wonder if they were going for a "jump cut" feel like in films.\nI can say I loved this game. If you want a semi-casual single player platforming linear experience, with a simple but engaging story, I say go for it.","April 8","true","8.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Minecraft-style parkour. I tried to finish the game, but its repetitiveness of walking a lot, listening to a story in Russian and then another parkour, I eventually gave up.\n\nThe game on itself is not that looking fantastic, I have to be honest in that. Its okay. I did not really follow the storyline, because it seemed like I was chasing someone in an environment that was basically a gateway from Russia? Sounds familiar? Stargate SG-1 would love to hear all about it. But the parkour is what eventually got me losing interest.\n\nThere is a LOT of parkour, a mediocre environment (it changes, but I feel like I am pressing the forward button a lot before it does), not really a good storyline and by the time I find something, I have visibly lost my interest in the game. I vowed to finish every game if possible, but I will have to pick this one up at a later time when my rage calmed down.\n\nIf you like to play a rather dull game with a lot of walking around, getting stripped of your jetpack and no way to progress forward unless you complete some parkour-style environment, then go ahead. If not, then I would not recommend this game at all.","August 29, 2015","false","4.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

They really start to quickly feel samey.\n\nThere are moments when you need to refill your oxygen tanks or top off your jetpack for some jumping puzzles which I felt were kind of hit-and-miss in their appeal. However, there isn't any kind of gauge or timer for either tank. You only need to bother with oxygen when the creators felt like having you worry about it at seemingly random points in the story. The jetpack also lacks any kind of gauge or limitation on it's longevity. You can try the puzzle and use as many boosts as you feel like all day long. But, no matter how quickly or slowly you solve a challenge, the jetpack's fuel level mysteriously goes low again a short distance away.\n\nThe game feels like it has so much wasted potential. It's entertaining for a while, but quickly becomes dull and repetitive.\n\nIf you want to try this game out, by all means do so. Just wait until it's steeply discounted in a sale.","September 13, 2015","false","3.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It looked beautiful, and supposedly had a compelling story, complete with mystery and a sci-fi sort of feel to it.\nWhat I got was 8 hours of walking through deserts, and a few notes about how the humans destroyed this planet almost as soon as they arrived.\nGameplay: Walk, run, and occasionally die at the same platform leap every time.  About 5 (very easy) puzzles in the whole game, I don't think I spent even 15 minutes total on puzzles.  Platforming, a few very very VERY tricky jumps but mostly a clear line where there's only one possible path to take, high above everything else so it stands out.  Walk, follow the green track (or footprints), avoid traps that are off to the sides of the footprints.  Walk across dunes. Walk across rocks. Walk up hills.  Walk alongside a canyon.  Walk up to a building. Find a note outside. All the doors are boarded up, so continue walking.\nStory: *SPOILERS* (well as much as there is anything to spoil anyway)\nI'm on this planet. My crew is missing. Oh there's an abandoned soviet town. Oh my crew is dead.  Oh the soviets are dead. Oh the planet is dead.  The notes say the Soviets killed everything on the planet because they used the sole energy source for power.  Humans kill everything.  Wait, there's one woman! Follow her.  Walk.\nSuper game breakers:\nI might have still enjoyed the game except for the jarring limits placed on me.  Oxygen ALWAYS runs out when there's a refill exactly far enough away that I almost pass out right when I reach it.  Oxygen refills last 8 (in game) hours, or overnight and half of the next day.  Jetpack ALWAYS gets a booster right before I have to make a series of long jumps.  The booster will last until I make the last jump in the set, and run out immediately afterward.  The boosted jetpack was lots of fun, two levels made great use of it's superior platforming abilities.\nThe world looks HUGE until you realize that there's invisible walls preventing you from getting too far off track.  (With the exception of the forest level where I wandered around in mist for a full hour until I rage quit, looked up a walkthrough, STILL couldn't find the way out, and finally found the answer on a forum here on Steam).  Most of the game felt like the creators were pushing me into one path and saying "Go THAT way! And get there on THIS path! Don't look for shortcuts, we're taking your climbing ability."\nThe "Save and Quit" function is broken. The only way to quit was ALT/F4 or Task Manager -> End Task.  The save might put you back a level when you restart the game.\nIn-Game options don't work.\nOverall:\nGraphics - 9\nPlatforming - 5 (some levels 0, some levels 8)\nStory - 3\nPuzzles - 2\nSubmersion - Nonexistent\nGameplay - 4 (A few good sections boosted it)\n\nI would not have bought this if any of the descriptions had showed what to expect.","February 14, 2015","false","8.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

For example, scary music plays when there's nothing scary.\n- Sometimes, some of the voice actors have trouble immersing in their roles\n- Story telling feels a bit confusing sometimes. It's like they forget that we don't know some things, and accidentally skip those parts.

The idea is great but there are glitches and issues that hinder the playthrough that really really frustrated me. First is the controls: in the main menu I had issues where the highlighted section never moved (made exiting the game a job for end task). Then i had some issues with the jump function. It would be delayed (though the game ran fine). Second was the achievements: one is (as far aas anyone can figure) not unlockable. This is the Planet Historian one. Either there is a glitch where the documents dont appear or just not for PC. Also for some of them you need to do it on your first playthrough. Turns out you can delete saved games and it will count again as "first" playthrough. I dont like deleting saved games so that was sucky.\nHowever, the plot is interesting and definitely moves the game along well. And even though some might complain about distances you have to walk I thought it was a great way to represent how large and empty the world was.

And more importantly, I should not be CONSTANTLY asking myself that question. And I am. The controls are gluey and frequently result in falling off ledges and platforms that you need to be following. And you will be doing A LOT of platforming, making the sticky controls unforgivable. But I still want to know what happens next. I want to know the story of this far-away planet. So I'm torn.

Yes, the title has its merits, but there was hardly enough in here to make the game interesting or really stand out. So you end up reluctantly advancing while picking up logs and watching at some other stuff.\n\nIf I had to put a finger on it, it is kinda like the Max Payne (1) dream sequence dragged out a lot in large parts. without the dizziness(except from the camera) or the horror-elements. Also there are levels that are just too dark and the brighten option hardly seemed to do anything.\n\nTbh it became really boring in the end and I only finished it because I thought I had to.\n\nIf you don't mind traveling over a countryside that looks in many places like the hills in Battlefield 1942 did, if you like exploring places that only occasionally yield another trifle to look at, if you don't mind kinda horrible platforming and some clunky mechanics and can immerse yourself in this, then get the game.

Fun atmosphere.. Dont want it to end! cant wait for full release <-- Early access review. After playing the full game, the developers should be ashamed. Its really short on content for  20 dollars, although I must say I loved the story and overall feeling and immersion of the game. The developer should refund the people who bought the early acess because that was exactly the same as the full release and lets face it, I saw no difference. It was great in  the beta, but for a full game release.. 3.5hrs of content just isnt worth it  The Content for the money just wasnt worth it in my opinion when you can get much more content in other games for $20. Story line shouldve went farther then it did as it was short to begin with, leaves a cliff hanger and there is no planned DLC or sequel. I feel like I wasted money. Shameful this game ended up cut short. It had potential and a really good atmosphere feeling when you played it but the developer seemed to just want to release it and make money quickly and cut the game short with minimal content. I would reccomend this if the price came down from its price when reviewed.","June 2, 2014","false","4.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Now normally I use that term as a kind of endearing, tongue-in-cheek term for narrative-driven exploration games like Dear Esther, Gone Home, etc. which I enjoy greatly. However Lifeless Planet is much closer to a literal going-for-a-walk simulator. You spend the vast majority of the game trundling along... well, a lifeless planet. The game is drab and brown and and boring looking. There are light platforming sections as well, which are serviceable but nothing really special. The jumping physics feel a bit off but don't get too frustrating.\n\nThe excessive walking sections might be tolerable if paired with an interesting story (like "Eidolon") or beautiful visuals (like "Mind: Path to Thalamus"), but they're not. The story is mildly intriguing, but never really goes anywhere outside typical sci-fi fare, and journal logs and story tidbits are too few and far between. You spend most of the game chasing after a mysterious woman, even though you don't really know why other than "there's nowhere else to go". It just feels kind of aimless.\n\nIt's a 5ish hour game, but it still feels like it drags on too long.

It trys to be a scary game by adding some "spooky" sounds and some dark areas where you need a flashlight to see.\n\nEdit: I came back to this game, somehow.

The puzzles can't really be called puzzles as a child could complete them, the only really difficult part of the game is not backtracking because everything looks the same. I know this game isn't supposed to be about gameplay and all about the story and while the story is interesting the logs are scattered too thin and in some places are quite hidden, however each log doesn't really add enough to make it worthwhile to search them all out. Having the logs read out to you while you are doing your running could've made the trek less tedious, but if you are an english speaker that's not going to happen because all the voiceacting is in Russian.

It could have been a new universe for gaming, even may expanding into RPGs, strategy games, MMOs, fanfiction and comics. Instead of building upon this great idea which allows a variety of paths to take about story-writing, it turns out to be dull and somewhat cliche (human greed ruins everything) plot and it kinda ruined the experience for me as only thing I knew before buying was the original idea.\n\nI was actually pretty excited when I first saw the utility poles upon setting foot upon the planet, my excitement doubled then I discovered the colony and in the first hour I deeply felt isolated.

This is a walking simulator with some puzzle platformer elements thrown in, but those additions felt more like chores to do for me as most of them were pretty easy and rest of them were just easy.\n\nI enjoyed only 1.5 hour of my 6 hours of gameplay time (story ruined by human greed thing, "wife" and the game's perception of other life forms, isolation feeling ruined by swiftly attacking roots) so I will give this 2.4/10 which should be pretty fair, as maths is always fair.","October 25, 2014","false","6.6"," 19 of 37 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","19","37","0","2"

This was NOT my experience at all. The voice recordings themsleves were nice quality, but there was no substance to what they were saying.\n\nI do not recommend this game mainly for its pricepoint. You can find countless games on Steam for $20 that have so much more to offer.\n\nEven on max settings, the graphics are not worth writing home about. They are ,at best, OK in certain terrains.\n\nJumping, puzzle, walking challenges are anything but challenges. You will not have any problem getting past any of the obstacles in this game. I don't think it was the developer's intention to make this game at all daunting to traverse.\n\nYOU WILL SPEND 90% OF THE GAME SIMPLY WALKING/JUMPING AROUND AN EMPTY AND "LIFELESS" MAP. Just accept it.\n\nFor the time you will spend walking from the beginning to the end of the game, the conclusion of the story does not deliver.\n\nIf you do still end up getting the game, please remember that it does not reward exploring. You will not find anything off in the distance that will aid or help you in any way. I wasted too much time walking around the outskirts of the map treating the game like it was a sandbox rpg hoping there would be some rare relic that would give me a powerup or something. The only resource you will ever need is oxygen and you only get the notification that you are running low when you are approuching an oxygen bay to refilll.","June 13, 2014","false","5.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game holds up well in the beginning, decent writing and pacing, but as the game stretches on the pieces of engaging story or backstory become much less common.\n\nThere are very long stretches of platforming with very little to recommend them. The character doesn't respond or move sufficiently to make those segments entertaining in and of themselves. Adding to the general clumsiness of the platforming is the fact that some sections, one in particular, have regions where merely stepping on the wrong area of a platform ends up in instant death and the coloration differences from "Safe" to "Dead" are so small as to be unnoticable.\n\nThe intro and beginning are an EXCELLENT use of affordances to have the player move in the right direction and find parts of the story and history of the Lifeless Planet, but these disappear later in the game leaving a frustrating feeling of trial and error in some portions.\n\nOverall the platforming and frustration of getting through various stages could be forgiven if the story and engagement of the first hour or so had held up. From about 1/3 in until about the last 15 minutes there's precious little to find or do other than follow a linear path of jumping and occasionally pushing buttons until something happens.\n\nFor a first shot at a game I think it did better than I would have expected, but the first 1.5 hours or so is undoubtably the best part simply for how the exploration and mystery are handed to the player. The rest is just abyssmal.","June 13, 2014","false","4.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

First of all, the premise is actually quite interesting. You crash land on a planet that is supposed to be full of vibrant life and oxygen levels close to Earth's, but instead you get a barren wasteland with no air. Right off the bat, you discover a deserted Russian colony, which should not be possible, as you're the first people landing on this planet after a 15 year journey. As story settings go, this one is pretty damn solid. The only problem is, the characters suck. Straight away, the main character is bombarded with situations both deadly and bizzare and 90% of the time he won't even bat an eyelash. For somebody who saw his crew die violently in front of him, he is pretty damn composed and that screws with immersion so bad! You're supposed to empathise with the guy you're playing, but most of the time I just wonder what the hell is wrong with him. If the game was trying to put all its chips on atmosphere and playing experience, the complete lack of emotion really kills it. The secondary character, who you follow for the entire game, is just as uninteresting, except she speaks in Russian.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, there are no new or exciting elements in Lifeless Planet. For most of the game, you're just jumping around. I wouldn't really call the obstacles in front of you puzzles, since they are entirely too simple. You just move from spot A to spot B, jump over some cliffs and enjoy the scenery. Skill is not really a factor in this one - if you happen to die to something, you just make a mental note of it and any sense of danger is gone. You also get get a robotic hand at some point, but that fails to inject even the smallest bit of fun. Without a single mechanic to pull you into the game, it gets boring VERY fast. Lifeless Planet is not worth the asking price of $20.","June 8, 2014","false","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(Now there's a visual for ya)\nI found the controls a bit wonky, but i guess they work.\nThe graphics are... eh... i mean, stale at best, you're not in for any remarkable visuals, just different shades of rock.\n\nThe story? Well, thats what you're here for, right? Sure you're interested in the first hour tops, but its a lot of running and jumping between miniscule diaries and recordings that reveal the backstory of your surroundings.

My first hopes for the game were dashed, expecting a challenge... no, a little wonder... no, maybe something new in the landscapes design... no. In fact the landscape could be created in an editor in one day; a large soft brush has lifted the ground to make bumps, these are hills you walk on and as not to make it too complicated we will use one texture... a lot with the same large rock sticking out every 50 meters.\n\nThe "only" well designed detail in the game is the little figure you play. The story is incredibly week and I soon found that following a set path incredibly boring. I wanted to give the game a second chance after the first 30 mins, yet had to wait a month for that to happen.

(Also was not an early access contributor).\nThe game starts out with a brilliant concept, beautiful visuals and atmosphere.\nIt quickly turns into jumping puzzles. Then more jumping puzzles, then vaguely timed jumping puzzles.

It provides the player with an incredibly moody game world, interesting platforming, and a touch of puzzle solving. The real meat of the game is its environments, and they are on full display here. If you love breathtaking scenery, doted by strange and lonely structures, then this is the game for you.\n\nHowever, the strongest part of the game is definitely its early stages. Once you reach the midpoint, and you start to uncover the mysteries of the planet, the game loses a lot of the mystique.\n\nThe use of documents to provide exposition is nothing new, but this is perhaps one of the worst implementations of it. There’s no way for the player to discover or interpret any of the plot, because everything is clearly spelt out in the documents. You might be wondering what happened in a specific location, only to pick up a note and have it told to you. For a game that reveals in the idea of exploring an empty planet, I find this extremely strange.\n\nThere are also some transitions towards the end that don’t make a lot of sense. You might be walking in a cavern one moment, then a transition will shoot you outside and you’ll be notified, via the document system, what happened. This was incredibly jarring, and threw me out of the fictive dream.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, the story is rather silly, and there is literally no foreshadowing of the two final plot-twists. I’d almost say that both break the game’s own atmosphere, but I recognise that might be my own subjective view. That being said, however, there’s no excuse for informing me via text what the outcome of an event was; especially if my character apparently bore witness to it. Just show it to me and I should be able to infer its meaning.\n\nThe final revelation is also just plain stupid, and literally introduced in the last ten minutes of the game. While it does provide a sudden burst of energy to push you through the ending, it was so convenient that I almost forgot the amazing sense of place leading up to it. And this is coming from someone who really likes happy endings.\nOh, and there was also a subplot about a dead wife that literally goes nowhere.\n\nIn conclusion, Lifeless Planet is an atmospherically impressive game that is let down by its poor story. It manages to capture the feeling of being the lone human on an alien planet, but shoots itself in the foot with terrible explosion and a ham-fisted ending.\n\nIt is worth a buy if you’re interesting in the concept or atmosphere, but I wouldn’t recommend it at full price. And now I have to figure out whether to give it a thumb’s up or down.

You see, this game is one of those which wants you to experience the views and vistas while having minimal interaction with anything else. No shooting, no big puzzles. Running and jumping.\n\nThe story starts out very intruiging and leads to a sub-standard and cliche'd ending. Running and jumping at first seems enjoyable and even quite fun and exciting until you jump from one rock to another for the 1000th time and wish the game would throw something different at you already, or just end. The jumping mechanic itself is done as poorly as possible. Yes it works, but barely. I kept getting stuck on rocks and canyons and the almost non-existent air control after a jump mostly lead to an untimely death.\n\nThe best thing about Lifeless Planet is the music and the artistic concept of some of the environments. Because even though technically this game is nothing to look up to, it definitely has great atmosphere and you almost always feel alone and helpless on an alien planet. The orchestrated music, as I previously mentioned, is brilliant. I would recommend listening to the soundtrack because along with the atmosphere, it's the only thing holding this game up.\n\nDefinitely not worth full price and definitely not for those who are looking for a long or special experience. The abundance of graphical glitches and audio bugs (music and sfx would suddenly disappear in many of the levels) hold this title back from becoming a true triumph.\n\nTreat the game as a 5-hour experiment from a promising bunch of indie developers and you'll probably find something to like. If you approach it with hopes of experiencing anything above standard (except for the music) it will lead to sour disappointment.","November 18, 2014","false","2.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Unfortunately, it falls a little short on the design and execution of the product - so much so that you can almost feel what David Board had intended with it, but didn't manage to pull off entirely.\n\nI'm still recommending this game though, as you can really feel the level of scientific literacy in the writing, and the story gives room for some interesting afterthought. The best part about the game, is perhaps discussing the story with other people, afterwards. It also has its moments where the ambience strikes the right chords, making for some memorable events here and there. But they are a bit far in between, which is a shame.\n\nPerhaps if he had been a little more experienced in game design, this could have been a really great game. You can feel that there's a lot of influences from places like Stargate, Alien, Space Odyssey and perhaps even a bit of Shadow of the Colossus? But it all wraps together in an, unfortunately, slightly monotonous jumping "road-trip" where not that much happens throughout it.\n\nI'm not sure if I can say that it's entirely worth the 20 euro it costs now, but you should consider it, if you ever see it on sale.","November 6, 2014","true","4.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's an engaging story - actually several stories, intertwined - that sucked me in right away. The atmosphere of uncertain danger and mystery is very well done. The story unfolds slowly as you wander through the world, and in between the moments of discovery what it all means is left to your imagination. A lot of time is spent wondering just what the heck is going on, which is a really nice change of pace from always knowing your mission.\n\nI was a little hesitant to buy this game at first because my enjoyment of both puzzle-heavy games and platformers is very hit-and-miss, but the story intrigued me enough that I was willing to give it a shot. I'm glad I did. The puzzles are straightforward - nothing that requires the internet to solve. Any time I got stuck, a little wandering around led me to whatever I was missing.\n\nThe first jump puzzle was almost a dealbreaker until I figured out how to use the jet pack properly, but once I got the hang of it it was easy. There was also one level where I got hopelessly lost for awhile, but otherwise the game played out very smoothly. Overall this game makes the platforming pretty painless, and there are some jump sequences that are acually bouncy fun.\n\nThat said, if you're looking for a puzzle-platformer you'll probably be disappointed with this. The platforming consists solely of jumping (and one high-wire sequence you'd have to be drunk to fall off of) and the puzzles are very easy. This is really more of an interactive story, and the game elements seem to be there mostly to make it more, well, game-y. On the flipside, those game elements are unobtrusive enough to make this a good interactive story, so if you like story games, this won't disappoint.\n\nAs far as the story goes, I enjoyed it, though I did think it could have been fleshed out a bit more.\n\nI didn't encounter any bugs or other technical issues, aside from the mouse cursor appearing in the game if I alt-tabbed while playing fullscreen.\n\nThe game is short - though I took almost 6 hours for my first play through, you could easily finish it in 4 - so the price seems a bit steep. But looking at the achievements I can see that I even missed some pieces of the story, so it's also worth another play through.","November 9, 2014","true","5.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The atmosphere is great and the overbearing loneliness of the situation is made very appearent, especially because of the soundtrack. Now, that being said, this game does fall flat in a few aspects. The journey is long, and I'm not saying that that's a bad thing, but it suffers from something that I think a lot of games are sometimes a culprit of; waiting.\n\nExample: There's a rocky platform that I need to get up onto in order to progress the narrative. Although, instead of just being able to scamper on up to it, I have to use a lift. Unfortunately the power is out so I need to follow the cables to the source to get it back on. I do that and then the path I took there crumbles and now I have to take a longer way to get back to the lift. Once I've made it, I then have to turn it on and time my jumps carefully to get from ground to platform, and finally, onto the path to move forward. The platforming in this game is very basic to say the least, but to put off the story to go make the player perform a tedious and time consuming jumping puzzle just to get back onto the right track is pointless. Why? Why couldn't I have just flipped a switch next to the lift to get it going, or maybe a master power switch just a few yards away? Instead I traveled a few football fields just to accomplish the mundane task of turning a lift on.\n\nI really wanted to like this game and i must say that, at least in the beginning, I was completely immersed in the lonely astronaut's plight. The peril of being abandoned on an alien planet 15 years from home is projected well and the look of everything is quite forlorn. The big problem is that the game itself doesn't seem to want you to progress through it. It constantly makes you stop and worry about doing the next thing to make a door open or a path become available.\n\nThere are other areas where the only way to go is onward, but you have to make it across multiple platforms. This isn't so bad, but the jumping mechanics aren't very fun to begin with. The astronaut has barely any weight to him and his movement is slippery making for a few frustrating retries at certain points. The jetpack only adds to the grief, sometimes causing you to overshoot a jump, die, and be taken back to the beginning of the platforming encounter to try again.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the first 1 or 2 hours, but then all of the problems I mentioned above started impeding my progress and began to drag it out way too long. Once I reached the end, instead of feeling accomplished for what I had done, I just felt relieved that it was finally over. It all felt like a chore. You can call this game a platformer but the fact that it can't do that right makes it a mediocre experience. The story is the high point most definitely. If only the controls were tighter and the level design wasn't so focused on having platforming obstacles just for the sake of platforming.","October 17, 2014","false","7.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The minimal puzzles aid in creating some appropriate confusion for the player while they uncover the secrets of the planet and the astronaut's own story. While some of the controls are a bit on the rusty side and there are some improvements that could be made, the game remains sound.\n\nThe impressive soundtrack sells some of the primary moments of the game and can leave you either longing to be back home on Earth or wanting to explore. Sometimes the expansive maps can leave you feeling overwhelmed. This can be a good thing for some scenes but also runs the risk of tiring you out just by thinking of all the exploring to be done.\n\nLifeless Planet won't have you solving difficult puzzles or shooting down evil aliens. Rather, it will provide you with a story you can immerse yourself into and experience more than anything else.","December 30, 2014","true","8.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Why ? Let me put it in + and - category:\nAdvantages:\n1. Good and fresh idea - there is not so many FPP/TPP games that you are not shooting to some monsters/guys.\n2. Music was quite nice - let say it was properly selected to create good mood.\nDisadvantages:\n1. Boring as hell - If you will decide to play "LifeLess Planet" you will spend several hours mostly on walking: you switch something - you walk, you push something - you walk sometimes you have riddle and then... you walk. And it will take you 30 seconds to solve the riddle and 30 minutes to get to the another.\n2. Inconsistencies in story - most irritating is companion of main character there is some lady, half human-half ?. The main character do not even try to ask: who you are? or how did you get in here? - just, ok there is a woman, she can bread with CO2 and has green feet - horrible.\nBut the top is where your character says - "it is time to get some answers" - you think: finaly there will be some cool explanation, but there is nothing, complytly nothing, again you just walk and walk.\n3. No final battle no middle bosses - just walking and trying not to step on  "vegetables" which leads you to be bored.\n4. music - yes,yes music is in advanteges - and it should be, but if you are listening most of the game 1 track you can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of.\n5. In trailer the story about wife seems to be realy important. But in the game it finished like 3rd order story with forced ending.\n\nI can create realy long list of "I hate" or "I do not like" points about this game, but I do not want to tell you full story.\n\nIn my opinion it will be less painfull for you to just read the story than buy and play this game.

The story is very well told, the atmosphere is immersive, the jumping puzzles are fair and enjoyable (mostly), and even now I'm extremely interested to see what happens.\n\nUnfortunately though, I'll be finishing this game vicariously through a walkthrough on YouTube.  The entire experience was completely ruined by the Inferno level, which in contrast to everything else thus far is poorly design, poorly lit, and beyond frustrating.  It is in this level that I realized this game has no real gamma setting in the options, and also where I discovered the gamebreaking problem of having to start completely over if you exit the game.  4 hours in and I quit to go look up a walkthrough.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MasterSmidgett/recommended/261530/","MasterSmidgett","The Voice of Reason","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MasterSmidgett/","286 products in account","Do I recommend this game? Yes, but not at full price.\n\nIntroduction:\nI'll get some of the more objective stuff out of the way. The game is a linear platformer with some puzzles thrown in for kicks. The term "walking simulator" is a very apt one as that is essentially the core of what you'll be doing in this game. Most of the game involves walking from place to place, discovering message and data pads that slowly reveal what happened to the colony that was previously living on this planet. The only real challenge that comes from this game are the platforming sections where you'll be jumping, frequently with the assistance of a jet pack boost, from rock to rock in an attempt to get to the next location. Puzzles are also a component in this game. They all involve either figuring out how to get a glowing green power core into a monolith or pushing rocks and barrels around to divert liquid or give yourself a higher place from which to jump. There is no combat in this game. The only collectables in the game are the documents which tell you a great deal of the story and samples of rock which allude to volcanic activity on the planet.\n\nThe Good:\n1. This game has a really good soundtrack. It is a mix of atmospheric, space ambient, and synth. While the soundtrack is very sparsely played, when it gets going, it has a power to it and I found myself standing, admiring the view while it played.\n2. There are a ton of beautiful vistas in this game, many of which I took screenshots of an uploaded if you want to see them. While the graphics aren't exactly what I'd call stellar, Stage 2 Studios manage to work with what they have and make an environment that captivates the senses.\n3. Atmosphere is one of the game's strengths. This planet truly feels dead. From the scorching deserts and abandoned bunkers to the fiery volcanoes and haunted dead forest, it truly does seem like all life is gone from this world.\n4. The story was quite good. You are an astronaut (I never caught a name if he has one) who has just crash landed on a planet which you were told was filled with life. You quickly discover that the other members of your crew have left the crash site and headed out into the wild. You follow and quickly learn that something happened on this planet to cause all life to vanish. Not all is as it seems. I can't go into anything else without spoiling the story. They story is told through both voice acting and documents you find. The main character gives the bulk of the dialogue, only broken up by a man speaking Russian in the documents and a couple of mysterious voices as your character hallucinates.\n5. For me, this game was the perfect length. I beat it in about four hours and feel that if it had gone on much longer, it would have gotten tiresome.\n\nThe Bad:\n1. The camera in this game annoyed me. While running, you can't rotate the camera around your character with turning the character and making the camera spaz out.\n2. Character movement is very clunky. This is particularly noticeable during the platforming sections. You essentially can't turn your character in midair and he slips and slides a lot while running, which caused me to slide off the rocks several times.\n3. I encountered several bugs while playing though none of them were unfixable. There are multiple times where I fell through the landscape and clipped through terrain to my immediate demise. I encountered a bug during a puzzle during the Ancients chapter where you have to push four stone blocks out of the way so that you can move a semicircle down a little strip to another semicircle. Due to the clunky characters movement, I accidently pushed the semicircle out of the strip so that it was floating in mid-air and I couldn't push it back in. I was able to fix this by quitting out of the game, load back in, and repeat about five minutes of walking.\n4. The save system in this game could use a little work. In some areas, it works fine. If you die, you won't have to repeat much to get back to where you were. There are several areas though where I had to repeat ten minute chunks repeatedly because the game didn't have any saves close by.\n5. Exploration in this game frequently doesn't lead to any rewards. There are a lot of giant flat areas with paths that seemingly lead somewhere but ultimately end in a dead end. There is nothing which tells you your objective so often you can be left wandering around until you figure out what to do. I found navigation in the Chasm and Inferno levels to be frustrating because I didn't know which direction in which to head.\n\nThe Ugly:\n1. Some of the textures in this game look like they're from the early '90s. I particularly noticed this during the Chasm chapter. Many of the texture are smeared and stretched so that they are just a giant blur.\n2. The framerate frequently dipped below 60 for me. I have 2 GTX 970s, both of which had no problem running poorly optimized games (as of the time of this review) like Arkham Knight at above 60FPS. I noticed the frame drop most prominently in the chapter called Ancients. According to the frame counter that was introduced in a beta client of Steam, I was getting anywhere from 15-40 frames in that section unless I was looking directly at the sky or ground. This shouldn't be much of a deterrent as there are only a few spots like that in the game. Most of the game ran at or around 60 frames per second.\n\nSummary: This game is good little game if not a bit rough around the edges. Most of the negatives can be overlooked and some people may not even have a problem with them. I would definitely buy this when it is on sale, around $10.00. It offers a good little story and some beautiful vistas and some a few interesting platforming sections.\n","July 25, 2015","true","4.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

While I don't think its worth full retail price its definitely something to consider during the sales.\n\nThe music was beautifully done and contrasted well with the gameplay. Parts had you on edge wondering what was going to jump out at you next, while other levels were laid back and you could enjoy the view. The scenery for each level was amazing, I especially liked the volcano and how it was in the background for the levels after that.\n\nThe gameplay itself is not difficult at all, I'm really not into puzzle games but the simplicity of this made it more of a parkour and follow the green glowing path. I think the gameplay was a little too slow paced for my liking in parts. You travel from A to B and thats pretty much all you can do.\n\nThe storyline does make up for a lot of its downfalls. The concept and plot throughout the game kept me playing until I could see how it all ended for myself. It definitely went a different route than I expected with the plot which was exciting to see unfold, I think this was definitely the main reason why I kept playing and why I am writing this review now. Its original and refreshing to see something so out of the ordinary for gaming.\n\nI'm recommending this because despite its problems I did enjoy what it had to offer. I'm happy to have supported the developer and hope to see another game from them with the right improvements.","August 5, 2015","true","4.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Key gameplay elements function as foreshadowing - if you see an oxygen drop in the distance you'll learn you have just enough time to beeline for it before you die; when you find jetpack fuel you know it'll run out as soon as you've cleared the jumping puzzle that it portends.  Air and propellant are otherwise infinite, which neatly avoids the tedium of "survival" resource management.  Jump cuts between levels are frequently immersion-breaking and serve as reminders that despite a very Open World feel, Lifeless Planet is a linear platformer with few, if any, rewards for exploration beyond the path set by the narrative.\n\nPretty, minimal, and functional, with very low replay value - Lifeless Planet is a short game and a short story.  The brief runtime (or rather, walktime) combined with shallow gameplay and a personal distaste for certain elements of the narrative lead me to not recommend the game at the list price, though I certainly recommend checking it out it when it's on sale.","September 11, 2015","true","6.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It looked like a neat "explore this alien world and no you don't have to shoot bad guys" game, which lately is something I'm very interested in.  So I was happy when it showed up in a bundle (Humble Flash KISS bundle) and gave it a shot.\n\nThe aesthetics of the game are immediately wonderful - this world was rather painstakingly designed for all the emptiness it invokes.  Hills roll, rock formations appear haphazardly, and you are free to explore quite a bit of it.  This comes in handy during some sections where it seems to allow you to create your own shortcuts simply because the designer didn't feel the need to have invisible walls all over the place (there are some, admittedly, but I was really surprised at how far I could wander without hitting one).  There are several different environments to see, though to be fair there isn't any real connection between them and they often seem to be there because they are neat.  The music is minimalist and effective; most of the sound in the game consists of your character's grunts as he hits a landing particularly hard, and the sound of your jetpack expelling air.\n\nWhat is Lifeless Planet exactly?  It's an explatformer (patent pending) - you wander around the world, picking up bits of information via glowing documents on the ground and assorted important landmarks and using your jetpack to clear gaps and obstacles.  The story reveals itself over time, with no pressure except the sequences when you arbitrarily run out of air and need to find a conveniently located oxygen station.  I'm not even sure why those parts are in the game, as they don't really bring any value to it.  At various times you are able to boost your jetpack to reach higher/further platforms, and you use a mechanical arm found early on to solve a few basic puzzles involving alien (?) technology.  One of the nice little touches is the weight and momentum you have.  It takes a few strides to get to full speed, and if you time it well, you can really boost with the jetpack beyond what you'd expect.  The crux of the game is always exploring, however.\n\nSo in a game where most of what you are doing is strolling through really cool environments, how is the narrative?  It probably isn't for everyone, but I think it tackles the sci-fi aspects pretty well and while it may wrap things up a little too tidily, I didn't dislike it, and I certainly didn't see where it was going ahead of time.  I had a good enough time jetpacking around hot springs and enormous forests with the occasional story interruption to continue through to the end.

The game looks great, but some of the game's platform mechanics are a bit frustrating. Of course, in a game which has no combat, you must have some other means of challenging the player. So, jumping puzzles for everyone!\n\nIt's a bit hard to discuss the game without spoilers as so much happens fairly soon. Your spacecraft has made a non-recoverable landing on what you expect to be a lush, living world some light years distant from Earth. What you find is a desolate wasteland until you discover signs of life, impossibly, yet somehow from Earth's past. You must discover what this is and how it happened before you run out of oxygen.\n\nAs I usually don't like platform games, I was a little hesitant to try Lifeless Planet. I'm glad I took the chance. The level design, while sometimes a bit obscure, didn't frustrate me nearly as much as I expected. The lava level, though, is notably very tricky to traverse. But it is a platformer game through and through.\n\nMusic in the game is quite good, enhancing the atmosphere and environment in just the right amounts. Sound as well is complementary to the game, and the Unity-engined visuals do a really good job of conveying the vast distances in the game.\n\nOne of the most glaring aspects of the game deal with the arbitrary requirements for oxygen and the boosted jet packs. These two items are used and required in only some very specific situations. It's almost like the game designers had something more in mind for these two gameplay elements but didn't get the chance to fill out the design.\n\nFor instance, if a level doesn't require you to find oxygen, you can explore that level for days and never run out. Then, at the next level load, suddenly you're almost out of O2. It doesn't matter how long you explored previously, the O2 only becomes necessary at the next level's load. So, that arbitrariness is distracting.\n\nAnother distraction is that the level transitions can be quite jarring. More than once I wondered how I went from the previous level to the one in which I suddenly found myself. Fortunately or not, the fairly linear design keeps you going in the right direction without being too obvious about it.\n\nSo, would I recommend this game? If you like good-looking atmosphere and slow, non-combat gameplay, then DEFINITELY. If you like any of the ingredients listed at the start, then give it a try!","December 31, 2014","true","6.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Everything about it has rough edges and much of it seems like the bare minimum amount of effort was put into it to finish it. The level design especially is either painfully amateurish or just half-♥♥♥♥♥. I'm not sure which.\n\nUsually a bad game is annoying. But this one just makes me sad. It could have been decent if not good with some more effort and experience on the part of the devs. But as is its just kind of shambled together to get a weak story from point A to point B. And you will spend 95% of your tiime going from point A to point B just walking. With nothing going on really. Just lots of walking and empty space.

The minimal puzzles aid in creating some appropriate confusion for the player while they uncover the secrets of the planet and the astronaut's own story. While some of the controls are a bit on the rusty side and there are some improvements that could be made, the game remains sound.\n\nThe impressive soundtrack sells some of the primary moments of the game and can leave you either longing to be back home on Earth or wanting to explore. Sometimes the expansive maps can leave you feeling overwhelmed. This can be a good thing for some scenes but also runs the risk of tiring you out just by thinking of all the exploring to be done.\n\nLifeless Planet won't have you solving difficult puzzles or shooting down evil aliens. Rather, it will provide you with a story you can immerse yourself into and experience more than anything else.","December 30, 2014","true","8.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You will have to push the rocks around, jump from rock to rock, and sometimes you will find yourself trapped inside a rock!\n\nFinishing the game with a fair amount of exploration takes about 5 hours.

These "puzzles" are nearly always just platforming (with one exception near the end of the game).\n\nThis game has a simple story that advances through the game, but provides the player with a somewhat hopeless ending (if months are weeks and centuries may have passed, would someone be kept on life support for 100s of years?)\n\nOverall, about 2/5 stars.

Why ? Let me put it in + and - category:\nAdvantages:\n1. Good and fresh idea - there is not so many FPP/TPP games that you are not shooting to some monsters/guys.\n2. Music was quite nice - let say it was properly selected to create good mood.\nDisadvantages:\n1. Boring as hell - If you will decide to play "LifeLess Planet" you will spend several hours mostly on walking: you switch something - you walk, you push something - you walk sometimes you have riddle and then... you walk. And it will take you 30 seconds to solve the riddle and 30 minutes to get to the another.\n2. Inconsistencies in story - most irritating is companion of main character there is some lady, half human-half ?. The main character do not even try to ask: who you are? or how did you get in here? - just, ok there is a woman, she can bread with CO2 and has green feet - horrible.\nBut the top is where your character says - "it is time to get some answers" - you think: finaly there will be some cool explanation, but there is nothing, complytly nothing, again you just walk and walk.\n3. No final battle no middle bosses - just walking and trying not to step on  "vegetables" which leads you to be bored.\n4. music - yes,yes music is in advanteges - and it should be, but if you are listening most of the game 1 track you can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of.\n5. In trailer the story about wife seems to be realy important. But in the game it finished like 3rd order story with forced ending.\n\nI can create realy long list of "I hate" or "I do not like" points about this game, but I do not want to tell you full story.\n\nIn my opinion it will be less painfull for you to just read the story than buy and play this game.

The story is very well told, the atmosphere is immersive, the jumping puzzles are fair and enjoyable (mostly), and even now I'm extremely interested to see what happens.\n\nUnfortunately though, I'll be finishing this game vicariously through a walkthrough on YouTube.  The entire experience was completely ruined by the Inferno level, which in contrast to everything else thus far is poorly design, poorly lit, and beyond frustrating.  It is in this level that I realized this game has no real gamma setting in the options, and also where I discovered the gamebreaking problem of having to start completely over if you exit the game.  4 hours in and I quit to go look up a walkthrough.  I come back, and there is no saved game to load.

Personally, I can't care about these anymore. Something went wrong on planet asshat, humans died, probably their own fault. Humans are stupid, that's a new one.\n\nTaken as a sightseeing adventure (personally, I love these, walking straight foward for 10 mins doesn't bore me) the quality of the vistas is a little uneven. Some are truly amazing - the screenshots on the store page prove it - and have a sense of place, others look like randomly generated pudding "hills" without any physical substance.\n\nPuzzles are very astronauty, they are about fixing things and survival, you do stuff with barrels, rocks, overcome obstacles. Sometimes you press a button and a platform moves.\n\nAs far as I've seen, there is really no combat in Lifeless Planet, something I approve. It focuses solely on platforming (imagining that Mario is under that helmet made the game more fun for me), path finding, problem solving.\nIt could have been the Martian Chronicles 64 or something else Ray Bradbury would have played in his lifetime.\nBut I can't recommend it.\nBecause there is barely any challenge. Pushing a button near a platform that then starts to move made me feel like a lab rat in a very linear obstacle course.\nAnd finally because it didn't make me feel lonely at all. I can't tell why exactly. Maybe because steady progression, simple, solvable problems create the opposite of feeling lost.\nI haven't finished the game yet. I'd really like to. But it bores me with linearity, engineering puzzles and a worn off, logfile driven story.","June 7, 2014","false","2.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The story is given almost too incrementally and feels very contrived, the main characters dialogue does nothing to further the narrative, or make it more enjoyable. Gameplay is basic, with puzzles a child should have no issue figuring out, and doesn't really challenge, except when it comes to judging distances and hoping to hell you do not over or under judge and fall to your death. Aside from jumping, the only other thing you have to worry about is your oxygen supply, but is just another thing that has been added in for a false sense of depth as everytime you're about to run out (scripted) there is a place to fill up just ahead, similar to the enhanced boost for the jetpack, running out at scripted areas instead of by actual measure. For a game that people are touting to be very atmospheric, it is seriously lacking it; as well as depth and fun, for the most part.\n\nThe graphics are very dated, sitting around turn of the millenium for texturing, shading etc, but it does have some decent models here and there. It's a mixed bag with nothing to really wow you. The still shots of the game look pretty but those are not in motion, where the lack of textures and mapping really glare and are pretty much the few pretty areas in an otherwise bland game. Though if the rest of the game was actually decent, and the price set to something reasonable, I wouldn't give a damn about the graphics.\n\nThe audio in the game is about as basic as the game itself, with only the soundtrack to be worth anything of note. Most of the sound effects could have been pulled off with an compressed air canister, a fan close to a mic and placing a coffecup heavily onto a wood desk. Like the rest of the game there is no real depth or realism to the audio to pull you in.\n\n3/10 It is a good effort, but all in all the game is bland and boring. I cannot find any reason to recommend it, especially at the $22CAD price point it sits at. If this was $6 or less the serious flaws could be overlooked for what it is, a basic game. People praising this game for all things it is not confuse me. We do need indie developers, we do need variation in our games, but charging what this dev is for something that would have been basic on even the PS2 is no better than paying EA/Activision for their half baked buggy games and DLC. If we convince ourselves and developers that this is okay, we will be sitting in a rut of half arsed games forever.\n\nThank goodness I got this as part of a bundle.\n\nUpdate 1) After another round trying to make it through the boring tedium my opinion of the game has not increased. More enhanced jetpacking, with it's arbitrary emptying, more bland graphics with a smattering of beauty here and there. Still looking for the horror and suspense that people are talking about, but only getting really boring, spoonfed story which seems as forced as before with very little depth to it at all. Oh, and I actually started nodding off this time on some of the boring walks. I'll see if I can even finish this turd.","October 17, 2015","false","2.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

NO!\nThe idea was great and trailers are tempting, but.. It's simply boring.\n\nEveryone tells about great story.. What story? The game bases on jumping around the deserts and rocks, and even when you get a stronger jetpack it suddenly runs off  when you reach a certain point on the map. The same thing is with the oxygen. You can move around one location, not moving on with the story (what story?) and the oxygen is full, you do not need to refill it, but when you reach a certain point it runs off, and you cant go back. You have to run straight to the next tank to refill your oxygen. That's ridiculous!\nI guess I won't play it again. The grapchics are also not that good. It's all too simple, not detailed and I felt like playing game from before 2000, with all respect to the games before 2000. Interaction with the enviroment? What interaction? What environment? You can fall and die, that's the maximum interaction you get.\nAnd the last thing.. the price. For 19,99€ you can buy 3-5 a lot better games for their full price.\nIf you have to buy it do not spend your money, spend someone else's money or talk them into buying this game to you as a gift. This way you will make them happy by lying how much you like this game and you appeciate this gift.\n\nSeriously, do not buy it for more than 5€, that's the highest acceptable price for me.","July 26, 2015","false","2.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

More like lifeless game. This hunk of crap should be priced at no more than $1. In fact, they should be paying YOU to play this repetative, ugly, boring "game". If you like long walks in uninteresting deserts, then this game is for you. It even has a plant species that will kill you if you go off the designated path. Everything is so "mysterious", so naturally you just keep pushing on down the track instead of stopping to do any REAL investigating. From the beginning you can tell that not a whole lot of thought was put into this game. Your team of three astronauts crash lands in a tiny little pod, the kind that drop people from the space station. So how the hell were any of the characters supposed to get off the planet?? It's obviously a suicide mission, but they never touch on that. And you wake up magically outside your craft and in your boring, inept suit, your teammates long gone. Who were they? Why did they leave? Meh, it's not important. Naturally the first thing you should do is split up when landing on an alien planet you believe harbors life. And you randomly run out of oxygen, but only when you're nearby a convenient oxygen dump. Simply go near it and you're good. What's the point of this  little exercise? Not a damn thing. Oh, and you can collect little rock samples, which is neat because you're character is a geologist. A geologist that gets sent to an alien planet presumably because it has alien life on it. Smart. As you stumble down the track (which you cannot deviate from), you quickly come across one of your crew, bleeding in a barn. The crewmember doesn't speak, you don't say their name (they're just "buddy" to you) and then they get sucked into the ground and your character is like "huh... better press on then. Gee wiz this place is strange." Oh, and did I mention the barn is guarded by a sentient tornado? You can outwalk it, so you never need deal with it, and it never gets mentioned in the game, so it really doesn't matter. After meaningless exercises in jumping and jet packing along most perilous and haphazard trails, all in an effort to chase down some Russian-alien hybrid girl (with rendering from 2005, even with the graphics jacked up to "fantastic" level). The story comes to an abrupt end when you come to the second big alien door with buttons that are just too high, which require the use of a super-exciting robot arm. The first door opens easily enough, but the second door features nothing but broken buttons that you can't press, leaving you stuck. Think there's a way around it? Nope. There's invisible walls guarding the only way around. Think there's something else you should do? Nope, there's absolutely nothing else going on, except some huge structure that you can't access due to a broken lift. Think you can save right there and load it up later when you've calmed down? Nope, you're starting all the way at the beginning of the level so you get to go through the meaningless trails once more. Hope you like walking, jumping, and jet packing (but only a little bit, because your suit is ♥♥♥♥), because that's all you're going to be doing.","June 8, 2014","false","2.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You can't explore much (it's not a open world game - you will find lots of dead ends) and you just have to believe that if you keep going forward and forward, something good will happen.\n\n2. Gameplay is really awful. In the game, is not easy to do simple acts, like move little rocks in the place you want, operate the robotic arm or jump in the platforms.\n\n3. The story is interesting and it's what keeps you playing - I wanted to understand what was the explanation for all that mess in the planet. I liked the misterious atmosphere (the thoughts about life and existance) and the fact that the astronaut does not have to fight some alien monster (he's just an astronaut).\n\nBut the bad things, in my opinion, don't let you feel the good things of the game.

The chase and mystery of the woman in the game added a bit of excitement as well.\n\nI loved the whole story to the game, it made up for what can be quite a repetitive run-about-press-this-walk-here sort of game, but it does a great job of putting you in a place where you are isolated; it puts you in the suit of the astronaut trying to find his lost crew members and find a way out of the planet.\nI wish we'd have learnt more about the aliens who built the portals; the small piece we learn is quite blunt and quick which was disappointing.\n\nOther than that, this is a very good game and I'd highly reccomend you buy it when it's on sale (I don't think it's worth full game price for such a short game).","September 6, 2015","true","5.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game is worth playing through once, and only once. And if you do play through it that one time, just try to run through it as fast as possible - trust me. I'm the kind of guy who likes to explore, and this game has A LOT of ground to explore. Emphasis on the ground. It is, indeed, a Lifeless Planet. And not only is it lifeless, it has nothing interesting off the beaten path - a path which, I might add, seems designed to make you think there's something interesting if you just take the five minutes to go down a branch or the 20 minutes to explore an open area only to disappoint you Every. Single. Time. No, finding the quartz/mineral/science collectibles was not satisfying. The collectibles are not worth it in the least, and you'll get all the logs as far as I can tell just by keeping an eye open for them while you progress.\n\nSo, with all that in mind, the story is something that I feel should be experienced at least once, and the pacing is such that if you move through it as fast as possible, you may be able to make up for some of the poor poor pacing of this game. Oh, and another thing, grab it for $5. It's really a $5 game. I know this review sounds like I should have given it a good ol' "No" as far as recommendations go, but it really is a great effort for the one guy that seemed to have had anything to do with making it and if there was ever a proper re-make with a large team behind it, I'd pay $60 in a heartbeat, nevermind the $21.99 it is now.","November 9, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

To begin with, the graphics look like a budget PS2 game, even with the highest settings. It really takes away from the experience. If you want to make a mysterious humanoid figure ACTUALLY look both mysterious and humanoid, make sure it's rendered well. Otherwise, just leave the mess out.\n\nSecondly, the gameplay mechanics are clunky. It's quite difficultto accurately maneuver the camera using either a controller or a keyboard. I understand that this is supposed to take place on an alien planet (I won't divulge any spoilers), and perhaps the gravity is a bit different than Earth's. But the jump mechanics are all off. Yet another thing that takes away from the overall experience. Why would I feel compelled to see what's beyond a vista or over a ridge when it's almost impossible move from one platform to another?\n\nLastly, the story is spartan at best. The plot progression lacked, well, progress. There was nothing driving the character, save for a few kitchy, awkwardly placed objectives (why would I run the risk of running out of oxygen on one part of the planet while not on another?). The areas which are supposed to look abandonned by something in the game look more like they were abandonned by the developers a quarter of the way through making the game.

Doesn't feel like exploring, feels like painful, drawn out walks. Like if you walked around the city in GTA V, doing absolutely nothing.\n\nAudio: 4.5/5\nGreat audio, super atmospheric and a beautiful OST\n\nConveyance (where to go): 3/5\nSometimes it was plane easy to know where to go, and sometimes it took me 5 minutes to figure it out.\n\nStory: 4.5/5\nFantastic, original story. It's especially great if you're a fan of Cold War fiction. However, there should have been more story, less walks in the park.\n\nPrice: 1/5\nI get that its a 1 man dev team, but 20$ is absurd. This game is far from perfect, and needs a lot of work. I was very dissapointed. 5-10$ would have been much more fair. I feel robbed.\n\nOverall: 3/5 I just didn't enjoy it. The annoying plant life, the 15 minute walking sessions doing nothing, the stupid platforming jumps, terrible optimization, FPS drops left and right on my GTX 760, plot holes, and more.\n\nWould not reccommend, I wish i could have my money back, or at least half.

It makes you feel that you are truly on an alien planet, and also how great The Dig was.\n\nVast landscapes, the music and sometimes the lack of it, sets the mood of the game. You are not allowed to interact with what's familiar; and that is definitely a breath of fresh air.\n\nThe story is weak and the puzzles are essentially non-existent. So it's difficult to recommend this game. I found myself looking for more tricks and gizmos, and when they didn't arrive, I hoped the story would get interesting. But neither really happened. and the game was over in 2 sittings. After a few hours, you don't feel you are exploring an alien plant; neither do you feel you are surviving it. So this is neither puzzle, nor adventure -- but a 3D platform where you are to follow the light and hop along to avoid death.\n\nI have to commend the creators for making the game, though. It's something different and my first impression (and the first hours were exciting).

Read tag tha says Walking Simulator...\n\nThis game is really fun for the first 2 hours you play, after that (and sometimes before) It's a walking simulator with rage quit after rage quit.  It's got serious potential, but I cannot stress this enough; the level design is awful, complete garbage. I have spent the last hour trying to figure out where to go on the level "Inferno". I finally found a little space that looked like an exit. I went through it for 15 minutes just to realize it brings me back to the beginning of the level.\n\nThe numbers:\n\nGraphics: 5/10\n\nControls (PC Keyboard): 6/10 (Remote): 8/10\n\nHandling: 4/10\nThe jet pack is the most annoying thing ever because you cant turn while in mid-air. This is extremely aggravating on long jumps with little space to land. Also the robot arm controls on the keyboard are awkward and i'm still not used to them. Finally the parts where you push rocks; when you push something heavy you lean against it and push slowly, not here. In this game you click the left mouse button and the rock SLIDES across the dirt and stops a few feet away. It feels like you have no control of where you are going.\n\nStory: 4/10\nIt's just okay, nothing special and a little bland, no emotion.\n\nGame play: 2/10\nIt feels like you are doing the same thing every second; Put green ball in hole, move rock, follow girl, collect paper, avoid death-plant thingy, etc. That is literally all you do. (there are some exceptions; finding you're crew and getting oxygen and fuel)\n\nCreativity: 6/10\nInteresting enough. The monsters are unique and the landscape is very good.\n\nPrice: 3/10\nGetting it on the Humble Bundle, its a grate value. Full price $15.00, not so much. Wait for it to go on sale before buying.\n\nHype: 0/10\nThis game is totally NOT what i got from the description. I saw a fun and challenging game similar to Limbo in the puzzles and close to Moon Base Alpha for texture/modeling of the world and people. Absolute turn off.\n\nOver all: 3/10\nDo not buy!\n\nNOTE/EDIT: If you are getting this because you love space simulators/adventures, don't. I'd suggest Take On Mars and/or Lunar Flight. Both 8-9/10's for me :)","July 17, 2014","false","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It seemed like a really cool idea and I really wanted to like it.\n\nThe atmosphere, the music, and the setup of the story is fantastic. However, after an hour into the game I came to following conclusions:\n\n- You walk. A lot. It's a complete walking simulator with big giant set pieces that set up the isolation that you're supposed to feel. It works, but most of the time I played it I was walking instead of looking around trying to get the story going.\n\n- It's very linear. The game is on rails and you can tell that you can't go to certain areas. The terrain luckily blocks you from going anywhere that the story doesn't want you to and it got old pretty fast.\n\n- The jumping is hugely awkward. You also jump a whole lot as well. There were plenty of times where the jumping wasn't accurate and I feel off the many platform rocks because I jumped too short or too far. You try and angle the camera to give you the best shot but you never know if you're going to stick a landing. This is especially frustrating if you fall off at the end of one of many jumping sequences and you have to traverse to the beginning of the area because the scenes are so big.\n\n- The Mystery of the story seemed to be solved within the first minute and a new mystery popped up in order to replace it but by this time you don't care. If the first mystery was stretched out instead of given away for such a cliche second one, I'd much prefer that set up.\n\nWhat ultimately caused me to stop playing the game was one such jumping sequence where I over jumped a ledge in the dark and fell to my death. Normally not a big deal but when I respawned, I was in the middle of a rock and unable to move. A Menu selection of to my last checkpoint did nothing to ease my problem so I restarted the game. When I reached a story/plot note that autocollects in your PDA, it registered but I fould the rest of the story notes blank. I didn't have the motivation to go on without my earlier story notes.\n\nIs that semi-petty that I'm stopping after a glitch in the game? Maybe. But it had lost most of my attention with the issues that plagued it in the first place.\n\nI really wanted to like it, but there's too many games in my library and not enough time in the day to continue with this game.

And you got a few notes and audio recording to collect so you can get some more intel of the story.\n\nYour character responds to the controls in a very jerky way (quite laggish). At times, I had to reload checkpoints since I just couldn't progress any further in the game. I was literally stuck as a required item was stuck in a danger zone, meaning I simply couldn't reach that said item without dying.\n\nLifeless Planet ain't a bad game per sé, but it's not groundbreaking either. For a platformer game, it feels much more like a "walking simulator" than doing platforms. Lifeless Planet's real problem is that it drags on far longer than it should, with no real reward for persevering through it. I wished the game was over way before it actually was, even though it figured the plot wasn't advanced nearly enough to provide the finale and the answers.\n\nPROS:\n+Very atmospheric game. You truly feel alone on this game and I loved that!\n+Stunning visuals.\n+Audio, mainly the music ambiance not only get's the job done but serves as your only companion on this game.\n\n\nCONS:\n-Controls are atrocious... even with the Xbox One controller.\n-While the game is neat, the gameplay takes a huge drag, lots of filler, before getting to the endgame.\n-20$ retail price is steep for an indie game. Wait for a sale!\n-Simplistic platforming and puzzle-solving.\n-There’s far too much pointless walking around.\n-Intriguing and promising story but also quite confusing. It stumbles to an incomplete and almost incoherent conclusion.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nLifeless Planet's trailers portrayed something far greather than what the final product got to be. The game itself ain't mediocre but it has many flaws. It has great atmosphere and I recommend you give it a spin for that alone. But the steep 20$ price tag for a dragged story makes me not recommending this game at retail price.

Based on that it is buggy, with missing graphical assets (character comments on visual things that are not present) possessing of a terrible movement mechanic (6"/15cm cannot be stepped over and instead you must jump, sometimes a single jump will fall short but a double jump overshoots, turning in place is impossible you can only walk in a small circle to turn, etc.).\n\nThis game could have had lots of potential to be a very fun and atmospheric puzzle game.  Instead it's a good idea with bad implementation.","June 16, 2014","false","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The concept is cool, I thought the town scene towards the beginning was good and I was excited to see where this former USSR alien planet colony was going... sadly it sees that was pretty much the only place it went. The communist/cold war theme is essentially played down for the entire rest of the game, even when you approach an impressive/interesting structure all you do is walk past it.\n\nHere are the things I did enjoy:\n- The plot (where is exists) is actually a good concept and towards the end it picks up pace again\n- Some of the scenery is epic\n- The visual style is nice\n- The jumping mechanics (although not what I was expecting) are actually pretty good for a 3D platformer\n- The Cold War theme (towards the start) is a good concept\n\nOn the negative side:\n- This is essentially a platforming game with lots of jumping sections (not expected)\n- The path is very linear\n- Many of the sections feel thrown in to add length to the game (lots of rocky sections and desert sections just to walk through)\n- The plot is far too stretched out\n- The cold war theme essentially disappears after the town\n- What happened to the hospital-bed that the character kept seeing at the beginning of the game? I'm guessing it ties in with the other character you meet, but for something that happens quite often in the the 1st 30 mins it does just disappear)\n- Walking up the "logs" is awkward with the controls\n- Lots of Walking... and I really like exploration games...\n- Oxygen mechanic is poorly implemented and adds very little to the game\n- Some graphical glitches coming in and out of cut scenes and easy to get stuck on terrain\n- just bland...","June 12, 2014","false","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's especially great if you're a fan of Cold War fiction. However, there should have been more story, less walks in the park.\n\nPrice: 1/5\nI get that its a 1 man dev team, but 20$ is absurd. This game is far from perfect, and needs a lot of work. I was very dissapointed. 5-10$ would have been much more fair. I feel robbed.\n\nOverall: 3/5 I just didn't enjoy it. The annoying plant life, the 15 minute walking sessions doing nothing, the stupid platforming jumps, terrible optimization, FPS drops left and right on my GTX 760, plot holes, and more.\n\nWould not reccommend, I wish i could have my money back, or at least half.

It makes you feel that you are truly on an alien planet, and also how great The Dig was.\n\nVast landscapes, the music and sometimes the lack of it, sets the mood of the game. You are not allowed to interact with what's familiar; and that is definitely a breath of fresh air.\n\nThe story is weak and the puzzles are essentially non-existent. So it's difficult to recommend this game. I found myself looking for more tricks and gizmos, and when they didn't arrive, I hoped the story would get interesting. But neither really happened. and the game was over in 2 sittings. After a few hours, you don't feel you are exploring an alien plant; neither do you feel you are surviving it. So this is neither puzzle, nor adventure -- but a 3D platform where you are to follow the light and hop along to avoid death.\n\nI have to commend the creators for making the game, though. It's something different and my first impression (and the first hours were exciting).

Read tag tha says Walking Simulator...\n\nThis game is really fun for the first 2 hours you play, after that (and sometimes before) It's a walking simulator with rage quit after rage quit.  It's got serious potential, but I cannot stress this enough; the level design is awful, complete garbage. I have spent the last hour trying to figure out where to go on the level "Inferno". I finally found a little space that looked like an exit. I went through it for 15 minutes just to realize it brings me back to the beginning of the level.\n\nThe numbers:\n\nGraphics: 5/10\n\nControls (PC Keyboard): 6/10 (Remote): 8/10\n\nHandling: 4/10\nThe jet pack is the most annoying thing ever because you cant turn while in mid-air. This is extremely aggravating on long jumps with little space to land. Also the robot arm controls on the keyboard are awkward and i'm still not used to them. Finally the parts where you push rocks; when you push something heavy you lean against it and push slowly, not here. In this game you click the left mouse button and the rock SLIDES across the dirt and stops a few feet away. It feels like you have no control of where you are going.\n\nStory: 4/10\nIt's just okay, nothing special and a little bland, no emotion.\n\nGame play: 2/10\nIt feels like you are doing the same thing every second; Put green ball in hole, move rock, follow girl, collect paper, avoid death-plant thingy, etc. That is literally all you do. (there are some exceptions; finding you're crew and getting oxygen and fuel)\n\nCreativity: 6/10\nInteresting enough. The monsters are unique and the landscape is very good.\n\nPrice: 3/10\nGetting it on the Humble Bundle, its a grate value. Full price $15.00, not so much. Wait for it to go on sale before buying.\n\nHype: 0/10\nThis game is totally NOT what i got from the description. I saw a fun and challenging game similar to Limbo in the puzzles and close to Moon Base Alpha for texture/modeling of the world and people. Absolute turn off.\n\nOver all: 3/10\nDo not buy!\n\nNOTE/EDIT: If you are getting this because you love space simulators/adventures, don't. I'd suggest Take On Mars and/or Lunar Flight.

It’s definitely not a funny game.\n+ Music... where you can hear music.\n+ The first 1 hour is a little weak for a start, but it’ll be a little –just a little- better, when you progress the story.\n+ Story is fine, but there will be unanswered questions.\n\n0 - Controller support is a good thing, but it’s not enough precise and the buttons maping is not enough good.\n\n- In the deep it’s a simply platform/jump-a-lot game, which is sometimes frustrating.\n- The gameplay is the main problem. Puzzles are too easy, not much to think just go forward and forward and push the forward button... oh man, I’ve never ever walked this much in a computer game. It’s a walking simulator :-(\n- Whole game is very static. Objects and textures are low detailed even in 1080p.\n- Too little interaction with the world.\n- You’re in a big planet, but the game is very linear, but you have to walk too much.\n- Some illogical stuffs... "You’ve enough O2 about 8 hours." then 5 minutes later you trigger a script and bang your O2 level is low. Other example: You can jump an hour with your upgraded jetpack in one place, but if you reach a specific place and trigger a scene, bang your out of your better jetpack.\n- Engine bugs (stuttering, texture flicker problem, rarely "stucked floating object". (I’ve a strong gaming machine.)\n- Camera problems.\n- 20 Euro is simply too much.\n\nIt’s simply not enough for a good GAME(!), it’s ok for an alien planet "road trip", but for an entertaining product it’s weak, and also weak for being a good platform game.\n\nSorry, I really want to love this game as a sci-fi fan, but I can't.\n\n5/10.","September 6, 2014","false","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I honestly did. The premise and the creepy atmosphere set against this huge, awe-inspiring backdrop both made the beginning of this game feel so unique and exciting. I hate to speak badly against such a small indie studio's efforts but ultimately Lifeless Planet is more boring and frustrating than it is enjoyable.\n\nIt's most praiseworthy element is the story it tries to tell. You are an astronaut stranded on a desolate planet, discovering abandoned human settlements and structures whilst trying to find your crew. The first hour and a half or so captures the mood perfectly. It is genuinely unsettling to wander through this world and slowly unravel the mysteries of those who came before. However, after a certain point, the pacing just falls off dramatically. There are no new developments in the story for nearly an hour, and the atmosphere wears paper-thin.\n\nYou will find yourself becoming irritated at performing the same weak platforming sections and avoiding the same old boring dangers. The puzzles are also a joke - childishly simple little sections of putting the only X object present into the only Y hole available. On top of this, the controls are awkward and will lead you to many any unfair death.\n\nUnfortunately, I haven't even been able to finish the game. Despite all my complaints about the gameplay and mechanics I still wanted to see the story's conclusion (after suffering through all LP's faults I think I deserve that) but no. I think I'm still roughly a couple of hours away from the end, but thanks to a glitch on one of the last hammy, awkward puzzles, I can't progress any further.\n\nI was lucky enough to get this at a discounted price, but if you want to spend £15 on a buggy game with an (at first, anyway) intriguing and promising story riddled with boring exploration, puzzles and jumping, this is the game for you. Otherwise, I cannot recommend Lifeless Planet.","September 7, 2014","false","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Dear developers, drenching everything in bloom, DOF and SSAO does not make up for lack of... everything.\n\nGameplay-wise, it is a walking simulator, with the occasional unchallenging platform passage. And walking is what you do, through one of the most uninteresting, empty, and same-y landscapes in recent gaming history. Please have a look at real landscapes to get inspired, do not let game engine terrain generators dictate your aesthetics.\n\nI cannot recommend this to anyone, sorry.","August 5, 2014","false","3.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's an atmospheric mystery with classic old school sci fi elements. While the themes of the story such as technological progress vs ecological balance, the potential for both horror and wonder to come from science, and the pratfalls of colonialism (space based or otherwise) are well worn territory, this game never makes them feel like tropes.\n\nWhile the gameplay is very straightforward and you pretty much always know exactly what to do, the feeling that you are walking through the final chapter of a fantastic and intricate story, uncovering the earlier chapters as you progress makes for a very compelling experience. I found myself very quickly drawn in to the lore and the environment and the game's central narrative device of the mysterious woman you're following quickly became an obsession, in a good way. While there are occasional moments where something feels incomplete (why am I over here now, why can't I land in that spot where I clearly need to go, etc...) I found myself instantly forgiving most of these small mis steps and almost never found them immersion breaking.\n\nIn addition, the physical world itself is absolutely beautiful, well accented by the minimal UI and solid camera work. I found myself taking a lot of screenshots as I played certain levels.\n\nOverall, this felt like a chance to go explore an excellent and compelling philosophical science fiction story (Aelita and Solaris are both major influences on story and tone) and one that I thouroughly enjoyed. While the gameplay is mostly linear and easy, the atmosphere (both thematic and visual) kept me thouroughly engrossed and this is a game I'm very very glad I had a chance to play.","September 19, 2015","true","6.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is an amazing and intriguing story, beautiful music and atmosphere and it was quite challenging in some areas!\n\nOnly negatives were that the game was quite laggy for me in some areas and I did find it a bit annoying at times when I'd fall off something and have to start again because of it, but mostly just user error! It was also a bit longer than I expected which could be a positive or a negative, it was a positive for me as I really enjoyed playing!\n\nGood work guys and I hope to see more games from you in the future!","August 20, 2015","true","15.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/camazotz/recommended/261530/","camazotz","Doctor Futurity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/camazotz/","673 products in account","Reviewed in 2014: http://realmsofchirak.blogspot.com/2014/12/lifeless-planet-platformeradventure.html\n\nThis is a playthrough review of the original game, not the "Premiere Edition."\n\nLifeless Planet is a sort of platformer/adventure game with a story about an astronaut who has landed on a remote world 20 light years away, on a one-way trip with two other astronauts to explore the first known habitable world. However, things go wrong and on arrival the ship crashes, the planet turns out to be barren and then mysteries begin to appear. If you've heard anything at all about this game then you know the (SPOILER ALERT) key premise of the mystery is that your astronaut stumbles across what looks like a remote Soviet-era town, leading to many more questions about how this could have happened, if it's even really an alien planet, and so forth. There's a lot more to it than that....but the core conceit drives much of the mystery.\n\nUnlike many adventure games of this sort the core gameplay is driven by platforming...which means lots and lots of jumping. It's not overwhelmingly all about jumping, but there's enough of it that if you're playing the game for the story and mystery it can get a bit tedious. If you're playing for the platforming elements first and foremost you'll probably find this to be below-par for your average dedicated platformer ...but don't take my word for it; I'm not a platformer kind of guy, and I definitely played this for the story.\n\nGraphically the game was designed by one man and it does show a bit. The game would have looked stunning a decade ago; now it looks and feels like a genuine above-average indie game. I am not easily impressed by indie titles, by the way....I find few of them grab me or offer more than a moment's distraction before becoming tedious, but Lifeless Planet manages to keep you going with a decent mixture of story, ambiance, mystery and discovery.\n\nA few items to note: there is no violence as such in this game beyond the risk of death from exploring a sometimes hostile alien world. There's a certain sense of dread at times but it is not a horror title, either. This is a solid straight SF tale through and through. There are some "huh?" moments in the plot, but it's more fun to let you see if you can find them. I'll just say this much....as you find each of your fellow astronauts, think carefully about how they came to be where they were, and what exactly happened to them. They were clearly experiencing a more terrifying game than our protagonist!\n\nAll told it takes roughly 5 hours to complete the game and the experience was fun. If you like adventure games like this and can tolerate a little jumping around you will likely find this worth your time. I suggest you play with a controller, as there are some exercises in the game that are just easier with a controller setup than a keyboard.\n\nAddendum: I ca't say this was a $20 purchase, but if you can find it for $12 or less I think it's worthwile.\n","August 12, 2015","true","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yes, I still recommend the game. I think it was unnessary long, frustratingly boring moments and painstakingly confusing parts but you should still play it.\n\nWhy?\n\nImagine walking for a few hours in rain, thunderstorm and complete utter chaos when you could have taken the car to work or bus to school. Well, on the way to work or school you stumble upon an envelop you get a few dollars, and as you keep walking you find more of those envelop increasingly more valuabe then the next. By the time you reach work or school you have had a "richer" experience.\n\nSo, the first 2 hours of the game is completely and utterly booooring but the last 2 hours really catches up with interesting .... things and faster pace and events than the start.\n\nIt isn't a great game but its worth playing.","March 22, 2015","true","8.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story and environment really interested me back when it was being developed and after playing the demo back in the day, I jumped the gun and bought it way back, now with some spare time I thought I would finish it and am happy I did. The game is made on Unity so we are aware of the issues there.. sometimes specially at the end the FPS would plummet even though am rocking a 980GTX, but the story and playability is what counts and even though at times it could get my blood boiling at the weirdness of the terrain for not making it obvious what would kill me, or what landing might get me killed, over all is a great game! I love the soundtrack perhaps the best thing? The protagonist background story moves along pretty slow, but that's understandable as the main story, is what keeps you playing. The graphics are OK.. Unity3D.. and the developer has kept it up to date, news on bringing the game to Mac/Linux and console is superb and I have to admit for a single developer this game rocks! Is well work the money! A few bugs here and there, but nothing that would render the game unplayable and for a plat-forming game it kept it mixed enough so I wouldn't get boring! 8/10!! way better than some so called AAA games out there!!","February 21, 2015","true","18.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's an atmospheric mystery with classic old school sci fi elements. While the themes of the story such as technological progress vs ecological balance, the potential for both horror and wonder to come from science, and the pratfalls of colonialism (space based or otherwise) are well worn territory, this game never makes them feel like tropes.\n\nWhile the gameplay is very straightforward and you pretty much always know exactly what to do, the feeling that you are walking through the final chapter of a fantastic and intricate story, uncovering the earlier chapters as you progress makes for a very compelling experience. I found myself very quickly drawn in to the lore and the environment and the game's central narrative device of the mysterious woman you're following quickly became an obsession, in a good way. While there are occasional moments where something feels incomplete (why am I over here now, why can't I land in that spot where I clearly need to go, etc...) I found myself instantly forgiving most of these small mis steps and almost never found them immersion breaking.\n\nIn addition, the physical world itself is absolutely beautiful, well accented by the minimal UI and solid camera work. I found myself taking a lot of screenshots as I played certain levels.\n\nOverall, this felt like a chance to go explore an excellent and compelling philosophical science fiction story (Aelita and Solaris are both major influences on story and tone) and one that I thouroughly enjoyed.

I feel like the ability for indie devs to create 3-D games like this is sort of a throwback of the early 90's when it suddenly became possibly for indie devs to develop nice looking 2-D games (which were then cutting edge).  It's nice to see a bit of fresh concepts and ideas floating around in the world of 3-D games, which I think is clearly needed.\n\nI will say quickly that at certain times, the controls can be a bit clunky (for instance looking in a direction while you're running, twitchy jumps, occasionally bizarre collision detection, orienting the flash light, etc).  With that said, I personally didn't feel that there was any point where these didn't pail in comparison to the overall enjoyment of the game.  This covers my only problems with the game.\n\nI think the first thing to note about Lifeless Planet is that it's creator's philosophy and artistic style is deeply minimalist, but the implementation is very rich and thoughtfully executed.  Let's start with the gameplay: you can move around, you can jump, and in rare circumstances, you can interact with objects or use your flashlight.  That's it.  All of the puzzles in the game are based around these mechanics.  With these minimalist mechanics, you sort of have to take the sushi chef approach to perfecting the small list of options available to you, which is something I enjoy.  It's not grating though, which a game with the occasional clunky controls could easily have done.  The puzzles aren't mind-bending, often they are straightforward; however, they emphasize the point of the game, which is to explore.  The solution to every puzzle is simply to further explore the environment around you.\n\nThis brings me to the artistic style of the game.  In principle, if exploration were required but the scenery wasn't interesting, this game would have failed.  The game, however, has magnificent imagery everywhere you look (and if you're playing the game right, that means simply everywhere).   At some level, the environment (albeit being rendered higher resolution and being better textures) isn't that much more sophisticated than, say, Legend of Zelda: OOT or Rayman 2, and in many ways it feels like a spiritual successor to the era of create N64 games.  A lot of modern games have a lot of sophisticated looking environments, but they sort of look very realistic but at the same time rather drab.  Lifeless Planet uses somewhat repetitive textures, but the textures are used to build very large worlds where the mountains, streams, ponds, sand dunes, etc, all look distinct and have their own character.  Far off into the distance, you can see unique looking mountains and structure that all give the game a certain kind of a character that's lacking in many modern games, and it has to do with the minimal palettes and textures used in the game.\n\nBut with that said, you go through many different realms (sand dunes, caves, mountains, hot springs, lava fields, etc), and each realms has a unique character which changes both the game mechanics, which I'll discuss in a moment, and it's own unique artistic flavor.  Looking around, you'll always find yourself mesmerized by the world that's sitting around, enticing you just to explore a little bit further.  So I might imagine that some people might object to this game being linear, since part of the premise of the game is that you're literally following a path that's been laid out for you, level by level.  However, it's precisely because the environment that you stray off the path and find yourself spending 10 minutes just looking at things.  The game rewards you for doing this by letting locate collectibles and achievements this way.\n\nFinally, I'd like to talk about the second major element in Lifeless Planet that makes the gameplay so interesting: The antagonist in the game is the hazardous environment.  As much time as you're spending looking at how pretty it is, you're also spending all of your time making sure not to be killed by it, or how to leverage the environment to your advantage.  To reiterate the first point, there are zombies or wild animals that are coming to get you.  When you die, it's because you weren't paying enough attention to the environment: You fell off of a cliff because the jump was difficult, or you accidentally got burned up by being too close to a lava field, or you weren't paying attention to what violent shrubbery was about you.  And sometimes, you simply run out of oxygen, because the air is entirely CO2 on this planet.  To reiterate the second point, you often have to figure out how to use the environment to your advantage to solve a puzzle.  Do you need to jump higher?  In the hot springs environment, you might need to place boulders on top of water vents, so only one water jet is going and thus radically increases your jump boost.  There are other examples, including using the violent trees to act as walking platforms, but mainly you sort of have to think very logically about what is going on around you, and the answer to how to progress in the game will come naturally.  Again, minimalist gaming mechanics, but thoughtfully executed.\n\nAll in all, I found this game extremely satisfying, and I look forward to trying future games from this dev team.","January 18, 2015","true","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/261530/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","There's honestly not much positive I can say about this game, it's a disappointment in plenty of ways. It's not horrible in any way, either, but a lack of positive elements isn't much better than incredibly negative elements.\n\nFor one, the game's physics are kind of iffy and the platforming is harder than it should be. Building up momentum is inconsistent and plenty of times I found myself slipping off the side of a rock or whatever. It also asks for more precision than it provides, at times, with narrow paths to walk across or somewhat strict jumps to make.\n\nThere's also just no sense of direction half the time. The puzzles are more "find where you need to be" than "figure out the solution" and at times where you need to be is practically a non-sequitur. The inferno area is awful about this, looking incredibly samey to the point where finding where you're supposed to go next is harder than anything else about the area. There's also a point where you have to traverse a large, open area to find one narrow passage with a switch you need to trigger. It's just... tedious, very tedious.\n\nThe plot's alright but nothing special. I don't want to spoil it but the plot at points could be compared to a rather-well known sci-fi movie with blue humanoid aliens... more near the end than anything though. Transitions between areas are also incredibly rough, just happening literally out of nowhere more often than not. It lacks a sense of cohesion to it, which is a bit of a problem in a game as linear as this.\nAnd I was sort of expecting a bit more than a purely linear path, too. A bit of ability to explore around would've been nice. Sure there are a few secrets to find but they're not that far out of the way.\n\nAnd the game's just a glitchy mess overall. At one point I had to go back to a previous area because the NPC I needed to follow me glitched out and wasn't where they were supposed to be. Apparently not having this NPC causes a glitch in the ending, too, so it's kiiiind of important. The only way I could fix the problem created was to reload and lose a fair bit of progress. It doesn't help that the "save and quit" option literally does not work. I've only ever been able to exit by closing the game window. Some of the achievements are bugged, too; Lifeless Astronaut seems to be utterly borked, and Planetary Historian seems to require more documents than exist in-game. Plus, I'm pretty sure I did not complete the game fast enough for Rocketeer but it gave it to me anyways.\n\nThere's just so much wrong... the game is a chore to play and the glitchiness doesn't help. Not particularly good performance either, I've played games more graphically advanced than this that ran better. I wish I could like this game, but I just can't, it's not close to being good.","November 19, 2014","false","8.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Check out my screenshots if you're unconvinced by the trailer. The soundtrack is stellar, the graphics are superb, and the story is intriguing and has a decent arc (which these days is a real gem). It initially annoyed me that I couldn't sprint and could only walk, but by the end I had seen the light. It's not a particularly long game, so don't be shy about taking your time. You're on another planet!!! The detail that went into the different regions just blew my mind. This is not just walking around Mars and saying "Oh hey yet another rock sample," this is a brand new world with so much to see and explore and so many ways to die horribly and it's rife with mystery that unfolds throughout the story.\n\nMy one major complaint was that for the amount of platforming the player has to do, the controls were too loose and the landing zone was often unclear. I appreciate and accept that the landing zone needs to be as unclear as it is to keep up with the aesthetic, but the number of times I caught the very edge and either got stuck and had to restart from the last checkpoint or simply bounced off and fell to my death...that got frustrating at times. I wouldn't call this a buggy game at all, but I think I found every single crevice to get stuck in irreparably. Perhaps it will be fixed in an update, or maybe I'll learn to suck it up and get over it. Regardless, if you find th some trouble, know you are not alone, and perservere.\n\nAlso, I loved the touch of putting in day/night cycles. This is not a horror game; but if you generally avoid the horror genre, play the nocturnal bits during actual daytime, not at 1am. I hope this helps.\n\nIn short: gorgeous, engaging, some minor issues but what game doesn't? Actual score: 9.25/10","April 16","true","5.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Here we go!\n\nThis game had a very, VERY weak storyline. Did not interest me one single bit, and turned out to be slightly misleading from the early access. You're on this planet (walking for-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-ever), and you keep hearing these flashbacks that have LITTLE-TO-NO relevance with what is going on. People are just jabbering on about your wife. At one point someone asks you, "you really loved her, didn't you?" -- and all I could think was "No ♥♥♥♥, she was my f***ing wife! I'm not gonna say I don't love the woman I said I'd spend the rest of my LIFE with!" (Granted, at that point I was realatively fed up with this game). Absolutely terrible story writing in my opinion (and there's much more to the lack of story than just that, but at this point I feel mean bashing on the writers so perhaps I'll cut some slack). Events that took place were hardly explained in ANY detail... Like at all. One moment you're watching a root consume a body, the next you're lying face down in a pool of slime at the bottom of an abyss. No joke. Exactly what happens. (spoilers... sorry.)\n\nANYWAYS! The main point of the game is to walk around, maybe jump a bit, run to the other side of the map, jump a lot more, pick something up, drop it, run a f***-ton more, jump even more, and then you beat the game. It is the most mindless, boring, lackluster game I may have ever played, and I wholeheartedly believe that is not an exaggeration. There were maybe 5 puzzles TOTAL throughout all gameplay. Tough, huh?\n\nI am sorry that I'm being so harsh, I only hope someone finds this useful before they spend x-amount of money on this game, because anything above $2.00 is simply not worth it.\n\nBut! If you do doubt me oh-so-strongly, then I would actually ENCOURAGE you to buy this game and sincerely tell me that you enjoyed running around a repetitive dead wasteland for three or so hours just to be given an anticlimactic ending. (Is it possible to have an anticlimax if there was never a climax in the first place?) No but, for real. If you think I'm cynical -- I welcome you be the judge, message me even!\n\nI would not recommend this game.\nAnd thank you for reading.","September 1, 2014","false","13.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

In this specific case I have spent a great deal of time trying to understand what was going on with my game at the very beginning.\n\nAfter start up the game starts with the astronaut running in an uncontrollable fashion. which eventually turned out to be caused by the fact that the pedals of the rudder kit were in their rest state which the game interpreted as instructions to walk. Pressing either pedal (i.e. using the toe brakes) causes the astronaut to turn and move in that direction. After some experimentation it seems that if both pedals were pressed such that they were at the midpoint of their rotation all movement ceased.\n\nIn  practise the game appears to make use of multiple joystick devices plugged into a platform but fails to take the trouble to identify the class of device. In my case I have the Saitek X52 pro Joystick and the Saitek Rudder pedals connected.\n\nThe config screen identifies the throttle quadrant as joystick 1, the joystick itself as joystick 2, but there is no obvious way to disable the use of the rudder pedal (bar disconnecting it [not an acceptable option]). In this case I have attempted to modify the null zones for the rudder pedal but without any impact on the game.\n\nIt is requested that the development team look into this problem as soon as possible and hopefully provide a fix.","December 7, 2014","false","1.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

Otherwise, I'd wait for it to go WAY down in price.\n\nIt's a nice attempt, but it fails miserably in controls and gameplay.","January 1, 2015","false","3.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Well. My friend was playing this game and he sounded like he was enjoying it so I was all like "Sure, I'll make an impulse buy" NEVER AGAIN. This game, if you could call it a game, is just incredibly boring.\n\nThe mechanics are boring and unoriginal. Jumping 'puzzles' and square peg square hole 'puzzles' are about as complex as it gets, nothing challenging. There are often bits where you walk around following a glowing path, so you can avoid the giant spike monsters... Why do you need a glowing path for that? Well let me tell you, it’s to involve a pointless alien character in the non existent plot. This game is labeled as an action adventure. Action, none of that, the most action thing that happens is maybe the occasional rock slide, or a spike shooting out of the ground in your general direction. As for adventure? Well plenty of that, if you think adventure is wandering slightly off the linear path and encountering a poorly textured dead end. I think in an adventure game especially one like this where you are supposed to be unraveling the mystery a lifeless dead planet, exploration should be rewarded with story, with plot, not with a dead end.\n\nEarly In the game you gain the ability to use your jetpack for more than one burst (In this game you can jump, then jumping again gives you a short bust of jetpack) of your jetpack that allows you to traverse relatively great distances then it swiftly takes that away from you, sternly saying "NO. No fun for you" (It helps for comedic effect if you think that in a Russian accent) Instead of making the game more grandiose to fit this new fun ability you have, it just goes back to the same old walk here, jump here, jump over a thing, move a thing to help you jump on another thing gameplay.\n\nThe environments are boring. Unless you enjoy desert. I'm sure some people enjoy looking at sand and rocks for extended periods of time, geologists for instance, but I'm not a geologist. I am however supposed to be on an alien planet that was populated by Russians. Think you could do something interesting with that, no? Really? They sure nailed empty though when that monotony it is finally broken by some man made structures, you quickly get bored of those too. One of the first 'interesting' areas is supposed to be a research facility, what wonders are in this research facility you ask?  Decaying soviet technology? Leaking vats of unidentifiable goo? NOPE. I counted about eight microscopes and some grey wooden desks. Chairs to boot. Can’t forget the chairs.  That's right. An Interplanetary soviet colonization party sent to set up the 'new motherland' bring enough construction materials to make several large bunkers and a dam, some tesla coils, desks, chairs and eight microscopes, got your priorities straight there. In terms of other environments there is the aforementioned desert, copy pasted buildings and bunkers, a dead forest (Desert with tree shaped rocks), canyons... Well... That's is... Bar some poorly textured alien set pieces  which they make use of several times.\n\nThe plot? You want to know about the plot? Wait. This game has a plot?! It does, and guess what it's boring. Actually. Scratch that it's not boring it's just dumb. I thought it was just about walking and jumping but no, It's some crap about soviets discovering a stargate, going through the stargate, somehow infecting and wiping out a weird moss that for some reason all life on the planet lives off that is also a power source with a terrestrial virus (quite how a terrestrial virus would adapt quickly enough to wipe out an extra terrestrial form of plant life when usually virus have trouble crossing the species barrier I'll never know, but then again I'm not a biologist or a xenobiologist) thereby killing all life on the planet. Oh except the mutant plants, what caused them to mutate so quickly to become deadly spike extending plants you ask?... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...\n\nApparently they tried to cure this virus, presumably with the microscopes.\n\nYou got space soviets wrong.\n\nSPACE SOVIETS.\n\nThere's an Russian alien chick too I think I mentioned before, she's suppose to be an allusion to your dead wife or something. I can’t really remember because of the two hours I spent playing this game I spent half an hour trying to climb a really tall pylon she was sitting on top of just to prevent me from slitting my wrists out of sheer boredom. I thought perhaps there'd be a spy who loved me cross captain Kirk style Easter Egg at the top but eventually I gave up. Not just on the pylon, but also this bland game, and also humanity, but that's a separate issue.\n\nAVOID AT ALL COSTS. You get it, costs, because this junk cost me 15 quid. You want to play a similar game that is several magnitudes better. Go take a look at Waking Mars. Better environment, characters - actual characters, good gameplay, it's less than half the price and accomplishes this without one third of the dimensions this game has.","June 16, 2014","false","2.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
