Loki has stolen Odin’s good eye and Odin tasks four Zombie Vikings with the job of retrieving the eye at all costs! Along the way you’ll find yourself faced with a fair few boss fights, some funny moments and bucket loads of loot!\n\nFull Disclosure: A review copy was provided by the developer.\n\nPresentation\nZombie Vikings appearance is, without a doubt, the best thing about it. It has a unique style which falls somewhere between hand drawn and cartoon-y and it looks great. Everything in the game is well designed too and the character models look good close up as well as zoomed out.\n\nGameplay\nZombie Vikings’ gameplay consists of moving through levels, killing enemies and collecting loot. It’s really rather simple and while simplistic gameplay can be good, I felt that the gameplay here had a real lack of depth, especially when considering the price of admission. As it’s a brawler game most of the gameplay comes from the combat but unfortunately the combat felt, to me, like it was just button smashing with the occasional break to pick something up and lob it at an enemy. You have three ways of attacking in Zombie Vikings: a regular attack, a signature attack and the ability to pick things up and throw them. Each of these can be charged which, when unleashed, performs a different attack. The signature moves for each character are pretty cool but for the most part I found them to be less effective than just mashing the regular attack button. So just to clarify, what I mean by lack of depth is that it’s basically just button mashing but there’s not really any change in combat from the start of the game to the end and there’s very little difference in difficulty.\n\nAs you can probably see, Zombie Vikings is 2.5D, and this works well for the most part. It makes the game more challenging as there’ll be enemies you need to move around to hit and enemies who throw bombs at you will be able to throw them at you even if they’re in front or behind you. The only issue I had with this was that you can’t move forwards or backwards when attacking but you can move left or right, most enemies move around while attacking you so I found it frustrating to not be able to attack them.\n\nThe map is effectively split into sections. Each section contains three or four normal levels as well as a boss fight. Since these areas are actually different parts of the in-game world they each have their own enemies as well as appearance etc. Even though they have their own enemies there’s very little variation between enemies with about three enemy types being present in each area, just re-skinned, and then a couple of unique ones per area. While this does allow you to get pretty good at beating those enemies I’m pretty sure that’s not a good thing, it just leads to a lack of variety which I found started to stop me wanting to play more.\n\nThe levels themselves are no more complex than my description of them at the start of this section. The only thing I didn’t mention is that most levels have optional side-quests that you can complete, the reward for completing these is a unique weapon. The weapons have their own stats but for the most part they’re all good so you can just choose whichever one you like using the most. As well as weapons you can also equip runes which give you some sort of bonus such as increasing your health or giving you health regeneration.\n\nAudio\nZombie Vikings has a great soundtrack. While I didn’t really notice it while playing the game when you’re in a menu or on the map etc. you can really appreciate the good music. The voice acting is also incredibly good in Zombie Vikings. The story is pretty wacky as is the humour and so you really need full commitment from the voice actors and that’s definitely what we’ve got here.\n\nMiscellaneous Zombie Vikings released with two day one character DLC packs, I’ll let you make your own mind up about this one.\nThe humour is quite specific, not everyone will find it amusing. Despite the fact that it’s not really my kind of humour I did find a few sections rather funny.\nLoot isn’t shared between co-op characters so you need to decide who gets what.\nA few people on the forums have complained about performance issues, I personally haven’t experienced any issues but it’s worth mentioning.\nThe mouse cursor is always visible, if you know me you’ll know I don’t like this.\nThere is an arena mode as well as the story mode but I haven’t been able to test that out with anyone. It looks like it’s just mini-games such as gnome football.\nAs I mentioned earlier in my review, I really don’t think there’s enough content to justify the launch price of £11.99 let alone the full price of £14.99.\nVerdict\nWorth Considering When Heavily Discounted.\n\nZombie Vikings is reasonably fun for a couple of hours, particularly if you like the kind of humour in the game but its weak gameplay and high price mean you should only consider it when it hits somewhere around the 75% mark.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","December 8, 2015","false","6.1"," 61 of 97 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","61","97","3","3"

But Vikings are just way cooler!\nBut … ZOMBIE VIKINGS ARE JUST COOLIO!\n\nThat’s right I said coolio. Deal with it.\n\nStoryIt was a peaceful day. Odin, the Allfather,  was just sitting, alone, in his chamber and polishing his rod so he has the SPARKLIEST STAFF IN VALHALL! (For everyone who’s now thinking about something specific … You’re an idiot. And I like you.) Anyway here comes Loki to ruin the day! (yay…). Since Odin cares about Lokis feelings (no one should it seems) he’s caught off guard and Loki steals Odins good eye! Furious he’s now summoning four mighty Warriors to go on a Quest to retrieve his mighty (and good) eye!\n\nThat’s basically the Story in a nutshell. And boy it’s tons of fun.\n\nDisclaimer: I will be using the totally not made up term Ziking whenever I refer to the mighty zombie vikings.\n\nGameplayProbably the weakest point of the whole game. I love everything, especially the humour, yet the gameplay is nothing groundbreaking but it’s not bad either. It’s stable and it suits the game pretty well. It’s advertized as a co-op game and I’ve had the chance to play it with someone but more on that later. Even if you don’t have any friends (no biggie so don’t cry buddy) the game gives you a trusty companion … A Unipig! Basically it’s just a pig but it has a horn on his forehead which reminds me of a Unicorn and sooooo … UNIPIG WAS BORN!\nAnyway you can use your unipig for everything you’d use one of your trusty undead but cool viking companions. He’s just not dealing any damage on it’s own but that’s alright. It’s busy looking cute anyway.\n\nThe game features a main story line (duh) and a bunch of side quests. The good thing is that you can revisit every level if you’ve missed a quest or just want to farm some more gold.\n\nGold? Yes that’s right gold! I mean come one what do the vikings do best besides fighting and drinking mead? PLUNDER! They love to plunder! You’ll come across chests and crates which you can destroy in order to get yourself some of the shiny gold which you can then use to upgrade your characters.\n\nBefore a level you have the chance to choose one of four characters, a weapon and a rune for your prefered ziking. The good thing is that once you’ve purchased a weapon or a rune you’re also able to equip your others characters with it. Which is a good thing so you’re not bound to use one character the entire time and at the same time it prevents the game from turning into a grindfest. My personal favorite so far is the Rune of Nothing (without any magical abilities).\nSounds awesome right? And the best part? It’s free! But if you’re one of those rich folks well then you’re also to buy runes which will increase your health points or your damage.\nThe weapons come in all sorts of shapes and … they’re awesome.\nI’m giving you two examples or rather my favorites so far.\nFirst up is Stinknir! Basically it’s a Skunk strapped to a hilt and it’s awesome!\nNext up is the sword that made me cry tears of joy and break it in a maniac laughter … It’s the one … the only … the mighty … Snord! And it’s called … GESUNDHEIT!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=571126300\nOh I still giggle and probably laughed way harder than I should have at it but boy … it still cracks me up.\nBasically it’s a giant (witch) nose strapped to a hilt. It’s just awesome as hell.\n\nBesides that there’s not too much to say about the gameplay. You can play it forever alone or you can play it with up to three friends (but seriously who has so many friends anyway!?) so the choice is yours. And of course it’s more fun with other people.\n\nI do have to say though that at the time I was playing or rather trying to play co-op with someone we’ve ran into several issues. First up the one who has been invited to join a game would only see a black screen. That was fixed after my partner patched the game. But then we’ve suffered from severe lag and from me being unable to see any item drops. Basically I had no chance to grab me some of that shiny gold … Such sad … Much gold … wow.\n\nSo I hope it runs better and I’ll update this part in case it does.\n\nCharactersFirst up is CAWW-KAA. A Ziking who was raised by crows and became their queen. She likes goth poetry.\nNext up is Seagurd. He’s a Viking, a Zombie and … he’s also an octopus. So basically half Ziking half Squid. Not to mention he’s the nicest of the group. Good Guy Seagurd.\nHere comes Gunborg. A big, strong and treasure loving Ziking. She quickly became my favorite.\nLast but not least is the crazy one. Hedgy! He’s … special to say the least. The only difference between him being a Zombie and being alive is … not much. He kind of was eating brains and the rest of humans before soooo … not much of a change. He’s definitely fun at parties.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=570953669\n\nThere are other several characters in the game you’ll see like the Maggot King and his Prince and seriously … everyone in this game is messed up and crazy in his or her own way.\nFor me that means a ton of fun.\n\nAudioSo good. So insanely good. It fits the game so well and it doesn’t get boring. I can’t say much more besides … Would you call me crazy if I told you that I’ve listened roughly twenty minutes to the pause screen music? It’s just like with Battletoads back in the day … Insanely good track!\n\nVisualsPerfect. It gives the game it’s very own and unique charme. But then again it’s not unique because Stick it to the Man (which is from the same Developer) also uses this art style and I loved it.\nThere’s also a lot of detail in every character. King Fluffy looks amazing, Hedgy looks good and even the background looks good. Overall it just underlines the humour of the game and at the same time it’s just fun to look at.\n\nThis bridge is province of Fluffy’s bandits. That’s why it smells like cat ♥♥♥♥! - One of Fluffy’s bandits\n\nHumourI have to give a special shout out to whoever is responsible for cracking me up every five minutes.\nWho ever you are thank you. I seriously love the humour in the game. It’s dumb, it’s childish, features sexual innuendos … It’s awesome.\n\nWhat else can I say?I have been lucky enough to get a Review Key for Zombie Vikings in order to write a blunt and honest to God Review. Just as usual.\n\nNothing. I’ve said it all. Besides that it’s a rather unique and fun experience. Sure the game’s gameplay is not the newest … catnip (I guess) but hey it’s fun. It has a fun and lovely art style, the characters in it are stupidcrazy and the humour is just so good.\nThe price might be a bit steep but that’s it.\nIf they fix the co-op you’ll have one fun game to play with your friends.","December 7, 2015","true","6.8"," 37 of 55 people (67%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","67","37","55","11","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jono1014/recommended/337480/","jono1014","Jono","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jono1014/","392 products in account","What is it?\n\nWhile Zombie Vikings retains much of the look and some of the comedic style from Zoink's first game Stick it to the Man!, it is a very different game that can be essentially described as an arcade-style beat em' up.  Players can choose from one of four different characters which all have their own unique set of attacks and feel to them and then progress through a series of levels which are mostly straight-forward, but occasionally have hidden side quest objectives too.\n\nSome may compare the gameplay to Castle Crashers, and they wouldn't be wrong for the most part, however Zombie Vikings does have less RPG elements with its lack of a leveling system.  While there is no character leveling progression, there still are quite a few weapons to find, purchase, and collect throughout the journey each which have their own stats and unique effects.  In addition there are also trinkets which provide passive benefits as well.\n\nWhile the game is clearly designed with co-op in mind as can be seen in the ability to pick up and throw other players and through portions where all players are sewn together into one giant zombie viking, it can still be played solo.  When going solo players are accompanied by a unicorn pig which will fire a cannon when players hit it.\n\nStory is a relatively strong element, which shouldn't be a surprise if you've played Zoink's first game.  Expect plenty of cutscenes and comedic dialogue between characters that makes the game feel like an interactive Saturday morning cartoon of sorts.  To set the story up without spoiling anything, Odin has resurrected four zombie vikings to send them on a quest to retrieve his eye which has been stolen.\n\nWhile you won't see a lot of depth in the gameplay of Zombie Vikings, it's not something that should disappoint as often times the fun of the beat em' genre lies directly with its lack of it since you can sit on a couch and enjoy it with just about any type or skill of gamer.\n\nWhat's Good?\n\n- Each character truly felt unique with their basic and special attacks\n- A decent amount of weapons and trinkets to collect each which have their own unqiue stats and effects\n- Optional side quests during levels\n- Designed with co-op in mind rather than just tacked on thanks to features like being able to pick eachother up and toss them around and form into one giant sewn up zombie viking\n- Solid controls with support for both keyboard and controllers and remappable bindings\n- Great art style from Stick it to the Man! returns\n- Fun and zany soundtrack\n\nWhat's Bad:\n\n- During actual levels the framerate feels noticeably less smooth than the cutscenes which are smooth as butter.  I was a bit baffled because FRAPS reported it was running at 60 FPS meaning maybe this is just the way it is supposed to animate.\n- For everyone but the host, the online co-op experience is not very good at the moment.  Expect weird animation lag which takes away from the fun of combat as well as gold pick ups not even appearing meaning the host can snag all your precious gold before you.\n- I would have liked to see more lite RPG elements.  Even a simple leveling system would have made me feel more invested into a particular character making the experience better overall.\n\nNeutral Thoughts\n- The humor will really resonate with some and leave others possibly annoyed with its mix of childish and immature sometimes mature humor.  If you like beat em' ups however I wouldn't be too concerned whether the game will make you laugh or not.\n\nShould You Buy It?: A BIG Maybe\n\nIt's very frustrating with this game, because I do love the art style and beat em' ups are one of my favorite types of games, however certain issues did kind of ruin the experience for me to an extent.  While I can't speak for the PlayStation 4 version which may function flawlessly, I can't recommend picking this game up if you were planning on playing it with friends online because of the lag issues.  If you want to play locally it is a different story as it is more enjoyable, however still kind of held back by the strange framerate issues which both myself and another friend experienced on our machines.  It's a good game simply held back by technical issues, so while I can't easily recommend buying it right this moment, it could switch to a yes with a simple patch that fixes these framerate animation and lag issues.  However, if you were planning on playing locally and aren't too picky about framerate, then by all means go ahead and buy as it should be a great experience for you.  I really dislike Steam's two option review system as this game is definintely not an outright no, but at the same time I can't just recommend it everyone, but for now I'll leave it with a Yes and hope people actually read reviews.","December 7, 2015","true","5.5"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

Especially fun with friends!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTruXpDmvWw\nThis devs  behind this game made Stick it to the man. Both games have a super unique art style, and cool animation.\nYou can choose between 4 different resurrected characters, each have their own weapons, and unique attacks. They even have their own unique dialogue within a level, which gives you extra reason to maybe replay levels.\n\nThe writing really had me laughing out loud. It's funnily written, and the voices are very well done. The music is cool and upbeat. The game does also have a few pop culture references, and breaks the 4th wall by mentioning things like Instagram and Tumblr. Normally I don't like that kind of stuff, but I feel like it's done in a funny way here.\n\nNow the gameplay, I found it pretty similar to Castle Crashers. Both games don't have an entirely in-depth system, but I personally still had fun with it. You have your basic attack, as well as a signature move that is very unique to each character. One enemy can fly into the air and come down crashing into a group of enemies, while another can drop skulls that are launchable by any player.\n\nOne of the most fun features is you can pick up different objects and other players. You can even stack them. I loved picking up my teammate while they held random enemies. It's hilarious fun.\n\nCollecting coins is satisfying, as you can then use them to purchase new equipment.\n\nMy main problem with the game is  you don't share money, so you need to co-ordinate with your partner to equally divide your loot so you can both upgrade. There were also a few graphical glitches in some of the cutscenes, but not too severe. Just a few blurry areas which took you away from the moment for a bit.\n\nOverall though, it's so much fun. I love the world, voice acting, characters and jokes.","December 7, 2015","true","8.1"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","19","28","3","0"

Absolutely furious, he summons 4 Zombie Vikings and sends them on the quest to retrieve his good eye.\n\nZombie Vikings is a co-op action brawler (up to 4 players) with really good, fun artwork and with an abundance of  humour.  You will take control of one of four zombies (each has their own power moves) and battle your way through 30 fun levels in different worlds.

You will find coins in chests but also in barrels. However, barrels could have brains in them, which is one way to regenerate your health.\n\nWith the gold coins, you will be able to purchase new weapons or runes. Some of them you will get by achieving a side quest and the others by finishing the levels.

The art is done in an incredibly thematic hand painted style and it’s really quite a beautiful game in terms of aesthetics. The game play is similar to Castle Crashers and other side scrolling hack and slash types of games. You are able to gain money and buy upgraded weapons or runes after you find them in the game world.\n\nWhat I enjoyed:\n\nDrawn together – The art and style in this game is fantastic and beautiful. There is a rare occasion when I will stop and admire every aspect of the art in a game and this is one of those. Every character is extremely detailed and has a magical whimsical feel. The backgrounds and environments are incredibly detailed and include tons of really wonderful scenes. I am really pleased that this level of painterly quality is displayed throughout the game.\n\nZombie speak – Generally speaking, zombies groan and moan, and are boring to talk with due to their lack of personality. These zombies are not lacking in wit or character, and their voices are just incredible. The voice acting in the game is really superb and the story shines due to amazing personas displayed by each individual character. The villains are also extremely witty and funny adding a deep sense of humor to the game and story.\n\nKeeping it simple – I like that the combat and unique mechanics of using different pets or body parts for various purposes. The game really shines once you get used to this aspect. Throwing a talking head at your enemies has never been so fun. The control scheme is not overly complicated but I do suggest using a controller as it seems this game was designed to be extremely controller friendly. I found the controls to be crisp and responsive, which is important in this type of experience.\n\nWhat I disliked:\n\nSwitcheroo – I really enjoy this game so it is hard to find many flaws. One suggestion I may have is that when you aren’t playing co-op you have the option to switch between the characters. The levels seem short enough and designed to be played multiple times so this really is not a necessity just a minor concern during the game. The game is very well done so it becomes difficult to find flaws vs suggested improvements.\n\nShort story – The game itself is not short, but the description about who these zombie vikings are and why they are talking to Odin is brief at best. I quickly found myself invested in their quest, but initially I did wonder what in the world was going on, and why we were helping Odin get his eye back. The story itself is fantastic and fills in the gaps well, so this is again, a minor concern.\n\nZombie Vikings is fun with one player, and insanely fun with four. I suggest grabbing your friends, grabbing a weapon and a zombie, and heading out on this adventure. These silly zombies will have you chuckling, and their villain counterparts aren’t witless either. The level of humor and attention to artistic detail in both visuals and story is beyond that of many retail titles, this is a gem of a game and I would venture to guess mine won’t be the only highly appreciative and shining review of this super fun co-op game.\n\nScore: Buy it now","December 7, 2015","true","0.9"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","2"

It features a fast paced combat with an interesting art style.\n\nYou have your choice of 4 (6 total with the DLCs) characters, and you can play upto 4 players at once locally. The characters play mostly the same, with their special attack being the aspect that separates them. You have your basic attack, when held it'll do a more powerful swing. The more you chain the more damage you'll do. You also have a block and a roll as defensive maneuvers, and of course you have your jump and jump attack as well. To help round things out, there is also a throw key, that allows you to carry and throw a variety of things, your allies, objects and enemies. The most interesting attack is the special key that each character's signature move. Like the regular attack, it has a quick press, and a hold variation. Each character's special varies quite a lot, from throwing groups of enemies, to a scorpion like arm harpoon that helps you continue your combo.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAbz8ArvzSQ\nThe game plays very similar to the likes of Castle Crashers. You and possibly a group of your local friends will head out, button mashing and comboing your way through any give map. Throughout you'll encounter a variety of different enemies and boss battles. Most of the combat plays out as you expect from any given beat'm ups. Zombie Viking's combat does feel smooth, responsive, and quick, but it don't really do anything to move the genre forward, but it at least feels good. Because of the variety in maneuvers available, the game does feature some depth in mechanics to learn, however it's also not the hardest beat'm up I've ever played.\n\nThe art style and overall presentation of Zombie Vikings is superb. It features an interesting digital paint look, that's whimsical as it is comedic. The sound track, voice acting, and story also reflect this. As far as presentations are concerned, I don't have much to complain about.\n\nOverall Zombie Vikings doesn't do much in the way of moving the genre of beat'm ups forward, but what it does do it does competently, and is overall an enjoyable experience.\n\nPros:\n- Great presentation\n- Fast and responsive combat\n- Interesting special moves\n- Easy to get into\n\nCons:\n- Can be repetitive\n- Doesn't do any thing overly original\n- No online\n\n\nCompletion Status on Zombie Vikings: incomplete\n\nThis copy of  Zombie Vikings was given by the developer","December 9, 2015","true","3.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This turned out to be a problem where our Saitek joysticks apparently messed with the controls, and somehow stopped us from progressing past character selections.\nThis was easily resolved by disconnecting the joysticks, but still a small issue.\nIt can be very hard to see where you are in the midst of combat.\nYou blend well into the rest of the games, your companions, and the enemies. I found myself standing in a corner fighting nothing more than a few times.\nOnce or twice I had a problem with odd "skipping", where the character was randomly jerking around in the midst of combat, making it hard to fight enemies.\nConclusion\nWe at Downright Gaming are greatly looking forward to uncover more of the weird and unpredictable story of Zombie Vikings, meeting more of its outlandish characters, experiencing more of it's great humor, and of course slaying even more enemies and gathering all the more loot!\n\nWhen we have delved deeper into the game, we will return with a more indepth review, so stay tuned!","December 7, 2015","true","2.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sawadegan/recommended/337480/","Sawadegan","Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sawadegan/","605 products in account","-REVIEW WILL UPDATE-\n\nZombie Vikings: The Review\nZombie Vikings is a hilarious hack-and-slash (otherwise known as 'four-player co-op stab-you-in-the-gut-a-thon'), with tons of likeable characters (my favorite being Frostbjörn), a half-♥♥♥♥♥ story (that's the joke, don't take this too seriously), a game-style I (and others) can really get into.\n\nGAMEPLAY:Zombie Viking's combat system is similar to 'Streets of Rage', a classic beat-em-up we all know-and-love. Each character with their own unique powerup, unique personality, voice, and flesh. There are many swords and runes to collect, and most of them can/are collected from doing side-quests, which usually means you'll/your partner will have to fetch something. Zombie Vikings tries not to stick to the same 'ol enemies like generic games do, they switch out the enemies and have lots of mini-boss/boss fights in the middle of a map. You won't see the same enemy on level 17 that you've seen on level 1.\n\nSTORY:The story takes place in Odin's home, where he's caught polishing his shiny staff with glitter-dust, when suddenly, Loki plays a trick on Odin, and steals his magical eye. Fearing Odin's wratch, Loki decides to flee (wise choice), leaving him no-other option than summoning his 4 (6 if you count DLC) zombie warriors. You will encounter many horrible creatures during your gametime :)\n\nART:Zombie Vikings carries a lot of it's weight in it's art-style, and it's not hard to see why; it's absolutely amazing! There are cut-scenes where players/objects go through floors, but nothing to complain about. There are details in absolutely everything in this game, and that says a lot about the developers and how much work was actually put into this game. Dynamic shadows and this art-style mix real well, it's shown when playing. It not only immerses the player, but it's absolute eye-candy, even if the story is about getting back a magical eye. (<3)\n\nMUSIC, SOUNDS, & VOICE-ACTING:("Oh my god, this music, were we listening to this ironically? Ugh, it's like a time-traveller from the 90's is trying to kill me with sound!") The music is enjoyable, and you can expect to hear the music all the time in this game. There's a variety of different genres mixed into here, and they're all fun to listen to even without the game playing. What's more, the characters can REACT to the music, which can be a relief during boss-fights. There are a multitude of sounds played throughout the game, but the breaking of boxes/crates seems the most generic, if not the most generic, sound of the game. Character's do not have different sound-effects for specials/reg. attacks, which can get repetitive.\n\n9/10\nZombie Vikings is something everyone should eventually pick up to play, whether it's with friends or alone. There are lots of levels, bosses, weapons, runes, side-quests, and unique characters. It's not a hard game to master, it's real easy in fact, so you and your friends can jump right in. The DLC is a little pricey, which is why I suggest buying the full-pack on sale.","December 7, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You can barely move from one screen to the next without hearing some quip or comedy routine going on which, y'know, while you're playing the actual game is fine. In fact, it's downright admirable how much hard work, talent and creativity has gone into the script and voice acting; you'll be hard pressed to find another game this year with the sheer amount of writing per square inch that ZOMBIE VIKINGS throws at you. There are a metric Cthulian arseload of pre-level scenes, post-level scenes, inter-level scenes and if they're not your thing, that's fine, you're more than welcome to skip them but herein lies the problem. If you don't enjoy this game's story and humour, then what you're left with is a very routine slash-em-up. The combat mechanics, y'know, the hinge of the entire game, feel lazy, moreso when stretched over more than two dozen levels. There's no crunch, no satisfaction in defeating your opponents and I strongly suspect that the multiplayer aspect that ZOMBIE VIKINGS is selling itself on is, much like the cutscenes that easily take up over half of the game's actual playtime, a counterbalance for how banal most of it feels. Don't get me wrong, it's not punch-you-to-the-ground, f**k-you-in-the-♥♥♥♥ terrible. There's nothing WRONG with it but as a six hour experience, it drags hard and it feels like the gameplay has been tailored to fit the gargantuan script rather than the other way around.\n\nI'd still advocate giving it a try if you're a fan of the genre. The cosmetics may do a lot more for you than they did for me and this'd probably sit a lot prettier if you went at it a bit at a time, rather than the start-to-finish marathon I subjected myself to. Maybe get some friends too. All mine are prejudiced against ancient Scandanavians so they refused to play this with me.

I really like the game.\n\nFilled with absolutely cringey and hilarious humour you are one of four zombie vikings sent on a quest to get Odin's eye.\nThe game is certainly made for multiplayer in similar fashion to that of Castle Crashers, but even alone it is still wonderful. Lots of voice acting, cut scenes and humor to blend it all together. Along with lots and lots of slaughter, which you clearly can't have without the accompanying laughter.\n\nHedgy is my favourite hero, half man half porcupine zombie; and a being of few words.\n\nThe art style is simply great, everything is 2D to the extreme and suits the game rather well. During combat or cutscenes you'll notice that when a character turns they are simply a thin line when looked on from the side. It's a little detail I really appreciate.\n\nCombat mechanics are very simple. Once again every smash-em up like. Fast weak attacks, jump, block/roll and a special. Each character does play very differently. Everything from small and fast, to slow and very powerful.\nAlso if you play single player you get Piggy to help you on your journey. He can give you a boost into the air to do a devastating dive bomb attack; or he can carrying a cannon on his back.\nHe's also small enough to be used as a projectile himself. Simply pick him up and charge up a throw attack. This actually combos rather well with his cannon barrage. Slap him to start the cannon and then pick him up and run around blowing things up.\n\nStory wise, the game is very witty. Although if you don't like american humor and mannerisms you won't like the game too much. Even so I think they do suit the game, and the detail and amount of voice acting really adds to the game. Even some simple enemies are voiced over, and can have a go at you during combat.\nSome of it, well, a lot is also downright cringey. This is either a positive, or negative depending on who you are and what you like.\n\nThe game wouldn't be complete without some loot though. You are vikings after all; so while you smash everything in sight collect as many coins as you can. These can be used to buy new weapons you've unlocked and runes which add anything from extra health to movement speed.\n\nBe warned though, the average weapon is rather expensive, so if you do get the chance try and do some side quests. I helped a certain fluffy monarch and got a cat on a stick as a weapon. It's a great weapon.\n\nAll in all, Zombie Vikings is simply a blast and I would heartily recommend it to any fans of the genre that like silly games and some cringey dialogue.\n\nPC Gameplay\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyZn5yJBFhE","December 7, 2015","true","2.4"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

Trust me, it’s twice as good (or four times if you have that many players).\n\nYou can read the detailed review on The Mental Attic: http://thementalattic.com/2015/12/31/review-zombie-vikings/","February 7","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are not familiar with them they are the masterminds behind Stick It to the Man which is another game done in the same style. This game takes the humour and music styles of that game and incorporates them into this one and makes it work so well. The charcters feel unique and each have special moves related to their personality.Speaking of moves the control scheme is very simple and easy to learn whether using keyboard or using a controller. The level design is not as good as Stick It to the Man but is still very nice and each level provides a variety of different enemy types and secret ares which unlock new things and can only be obtained through beating a challenge. The story is very simple but the characters are what make the story so good. Odin's eye is taken by Loki and he brings you and your crew back from the dead to retrieve it. Sounds simple right?.....Well it really isn't due to all the mishaps along the way making it more difficult to retrieve it for Odin. The only negative I have for the game is that it is really buggy. Boxes shake,people shake,doesn't let you progress through the level sometimes and getting stuck in walls. But all in all if you're looking for a humourous game with a unique art style then this is definitely for you. I look forward to another game by them in the future!","December 24, 2015","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The artwork is fantastic and the comedy is even better! I demo'd this game and PAX East 2016, and immeadeatly bought it!","May 25","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRocketNinja/recommended/337480/","TheRocketNinja","Dongus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRocketNinja/","127 products in account","Zombie Vikings is a simple, lighthearted side scrolling beat-em-up with a Tim Burton-esque art style. The writing, while sometimes pushing it's jokes too hard, is relatively funny. The combat is simple, but never tedious. Each character has their own unique special ability which makes larger battles a lot more interesting. It has some flaws while playing online. Animations tend to skip, there is frequent lag, even with good connection. If you have the chance, I would recommend playing local co-op over online, since it obviously doesn't have these issues.\n\nOverall I would give this game a solid 7/10, I'd recommend picking it up as long as you have some friends to play it with!\n\n","January 3","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If it's on sale realy cheap like a couple of euros then i think it's worth the try.","April 26","false","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
