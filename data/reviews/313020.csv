Games that reinterpret classic books usually end up being tedious and ruin the original work. Soul Gambler, on the other hand, is a beautiful modernization with an elegant subtext of its own.\n\nOur main character, Faust, is easy to empathize with. He is a young adult stuck in the dreary routine of everyday life: bored and jaded - until an old crone makes him an offer he cannot refuse... He is given the opportunity to sell pieces of his soul to rearrange the reality according to his own whims. We make some choices and live through their consequences while trying to discover the actual price of our new found powers.\n\nThe display is quite basic; with hand-drawn art and thrilling soundtrack. The story is incredibly well put, with consistent references to the actual tale and a well weaved world of its own. The narration is easy to follow and sets an air of mystery and the thrill of the unknown successfully. As a visual novel, it presents actual replayability and several different endings to discover based on your choices.\n\nAs a surprising side note the price of the game hits ridiculously low from time to time, it is a welcome addition to anyone's library. You shouldn't think twice before grabbing it. As a modern interpretation of the classical Faustus tale, this visual novel is a marvelous little gem for the ones that enjoy a mystical story.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","June 20, 2015","true","4.9"," 40 of 45 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","40","45","0","3"

The story was interesting and the different choices certainly had you involved. However, being one that wants to get 100% of the story and achievements (100% story you need to go through every possible dialogue; there are guides for 100% achievements), I sort of wished there was an auto-read or skip function after playing for a few hours that I ended up button mashing to skip the dialogues that I had read several times over.\n\nI certainly liked the comic book style they were going for with this--it adds to its charm. There were some minor typos here and there, but nothing that was too distracting to take away attention from the story. The soundtrack was lovely--save for at the credits. I expected an elongated version rather than a loop-track to play for it. But despite all these minor things, I found the game enjoyable and interesting and would definitely play it again.

He works a boring job and has a mundane life, but all of that changes when he sells his soul to a witch for wishes. Each wish takes away apart of his soul and you have to find a way to get rid of the witch so you get to keep your soul.\n\nThe novel is  a very interesting retelling of Faust, which I don't really remember much off, since the last time I read it was back in High School.\n\nThe novel is also quite interesting in general, since you can choose perk points at the start of the game and those help you out in other parts in the game, like seduction, brute force and intelligence to trick people.\n\nThe art style is also really well done, it's just fun to look around the environments, just because how awesome everything looks.\n\nThe multiple outcomes are also quite nice as it adds more replay value and I can see myself coming back to this game in the future to replay and get another endings I haven't got yet.\n\nA single run of the game will last you 1 hour, but as stated before there are multiple endings and from what I understand there are 5 endings so that's 5+ hours of content and for the price that's quite a deal.\n\nThere are a few negatives like some sloppy writing and the horrible soundtrack.\n\nI enjoyed my time with Soul Gambler and if you can get this game I highly suggest trying it out, cause it's quite awesome.\n\nFinal Rating:\n7/10 - Good\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!\n","February 17","true","2.3"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","29","32","0","0"

I am happy to report that this has finally been addressed with what I believe was a new programming team if I understand things correctly.\n\nAnyway, I was pleased to finally be able to play this game, and it was actually quite enjoyable, so in this case, it was well worth the wait. It's an interactive novel presented in comic book fashion, with the page frames and such. The artwork is quality. You would expect to see this published by a larger comic company if it was in paper form due to the excellent artwork and coloring. The story was also well written and engaging, and in fact, there seem to be many variations on how this tale can play out, so it carries a choose your own adventure style to it as well. You start out with some very basic RPG options which impact your choices later. There aren't upgrades or anything....whatever you choose is what you stick with, although your choices may end up adjusting some of the stats as part of the story.\n\nThere are some issues with the actual script itself, such as poor sentence structure at certain points (much like my writing here in this review, lol). It seems like English may not have been the original language for this script, and the translation was solid with just a few blemishes. Anyway, nothing major, but you will notice it when you read through the text.\n\nThe OST was quite nice, and appropriate to the theme of the game as well.\n\nAll told, I think I give this game an 8 out of 10 surprisingly, and I would encourage people to read the more recent reviews when making a determination as to whether or not you might purchase this game, as the technical issues that caused a lot of the negative reviews have been solved at this point.","February 25, 2015","true","1.0"," 34 of 41 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","34","41","0","0"

I had have problems with playing it on steam. The installation works but the game doesn't run. So i got after a few days the access to the full episodes on their website and could play it as browser game. My english is not the best, but i understand the very nice but short story.\n\nThe "Dark Arts Edition" is on sale at the moment (-80%) for only 1,39 EUR. Who don't know the game should take it now until the low price ends. I don't know what is different to the normal version, because i couldn't buy it as "Dark Art Edition" again. I got error message that i already own this game :-(\n\nI don't know why it got's so much bad reviews in the last days. Maybe because others couldn't run it with steam too or because the story is to short. (only 1-2 hours to play)\n\nThe author said that they are making a directors cut which will be free to everyone who bought Soul Gambler and that it will also fix the problem with the game being unplayable.So i guess we only have to wait for the Directors Cut of the game.\n\nNice is that it has Steam Trading Cards, Emotions and Backgrounds since a short time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/recommended/313020/","lothy","Lothy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/","1455 products in account","Soul Gambler is a Visual Novel inspired by Goethe’s Faust. I guess I can see how that’s true, as it does deal with selling soul and a guy called Faust.\nFaust is a normal man whom, as it so happens, is one day approached by a person after which he’s offered to sell his soul (not to spoil it, that’s as much as I’ll say of the story).\nThe gameplay mechanics are fairly easy from then on; it being a visual novel, you’re presented with the story as it unfolds and given chances to interact: do you want to do this or do that? will you sell x% of your soul to get this or will you not? And so on, and so forth.\n\nThe art is all cartoon/comic book styled, and though I wasn’t much of a fan, they weren’t visually awful either. The storytelling is told as an interactive comic would be, with panes appearing and disappearing. The story in itself was fairly good and kept me hooked up until the end. I wasn’t really overly fond of some of the endings, but they weren’t horrible either, so overall I was pretty content with the story even if it wasn’t anything out of the ordinary.\nSounds and music are pretty nice, and seem to fit with the game well enough.\n\nThe game is really short, but what it does really well is the amount of options it offers you. This, to me, is what a visual novel should be like: There’s a story, there are many options for you to choose from, and the options matter. It's still not perfect, but it's well on its way.\nIn addition, at the start of the game you are offered to put points into different stats, and this choice also affects how you play and what you choose, and the outcomes of making a wrong choice. The choices are also very well designed and integrated into the game style, and for the most they say what you see them saying - unlike other games where you press a choice and the guy goes off with something completely opposite of what you thought your selection was.\nSo, between the choices you can make on Faust’s daily life, plus the soul-selling choices, plus the choices you make at the start on what to pour your points on, you have quite a bit of replayability.\n\nIf you don’t play it for the looks or the story, then at least play it for the gameplay, particularly if you’ve ever thought of making a VN.","July 27, 2015","true","2.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

I uses FireFox (updated) on Win 7 , 64 bit .\nI really don't like music going on all the time through the game so I killed the music at lower left of menu after a while...\nGame appears to be a relatively short game but it might depend a lot on the decisions made..\nThe game allows for sawing at any point and you leave to menu without saving and restart from the save which will allow you to try different approaches from save point without having to start all over.\n"Soul Gambler" is a game that will be best enjoyed by people that likes to try out different strategies and who don't mind fast forwarding through sequences seen before.   Also the distribution of character points in beginning of game is also of importance to possible outcome of choices taken of available ones in game.   I could write a suggestion here what not to spend character points on from start but that would be ruining the game...\nI thought it quite alright.   Rather short - the way I played it at least - but I might try it again with different character distribution points setup and / or partly  making other choices to see how it alters the game story..\nA major annoyance for me was that the Steam overlay didn't work why I couldn't take any screenshots using Steam overlay.\nIt is not a game that I think is worth a lot or a game that I think is having that much re-playability , but if you got it cheap then I suggest that you look at the bright sides of the game like that it got some nice comic book pictures , but do not expect anything more than an interactive comic book...

Soul Gambler is another spin on this old tale, this time taking the visual novel format in a comic-like skin.\n\nOur Faust is an accountant stuck in a seemingly dead-end job, whose life is turned upside down when he signs the infernal contract that lets him sacrifice parts of his soul in exchange for wishes. Also, his story leads into a large, centuries-old conspiracy instead of an internal struggle with his own demons.\nThe writing is a bit hit and miss. The dialogues are often plot dumps and the pacing is hectic even for a visual novel, but it does a damn fine job with characterisation: Faust remains a relatable, everyday character even in the most extreme situations.\n\nThe art style tries to follows the Hergé-like clear lines school of drawing, with mild success. Faust and his temptress are portrayed well, but the rest of the cast lack emotions and feel lifeless, and the often empty backgrounds didn’t help a lot. Still, it is among the better art we can see in the cheap VN category.","March 22","true","3.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

If you don't have it installed the game gets stuck on the loading bar.\n\nI also feel it is important to go into this game knowing what to expect of it. This game is actually an interactive novel with multiple endings and choices to be made. It is by no means up to the length and high standard of Cinders, but that is why the price is lower.\n\nThe game offers a nice amount of options that will send you in different story sections. The endings are rather similar, but are different enough to spark curiousity for another play through or two. You may want to read the achievements section just to give you an aim of how to get to them. The attributes in the game matter more then you might expect. You have to pass certain checks in order to get certain dialogue. If you don't have a certain amount of intelligence you might fail a check that requires it.\n\nThe different sections of dialogue you can run into if you play your attributes/choices/dialogue options right will lead you to interesting little easter egg things before the end of the game such as ending up in the hospital or on the run from the cops. These are the areas the game truly shines. The multiple endings are interesting, but not as fun as these side routes that lead to them.\n\nAll in all I got this game for a buck before it got greenlit from indie gala and it has been well worth it.

The multiple outcomes added a lot of replay value to the game: a single run of the game lasts about one hour and you can get up to five different endings.\n\nThe main character is inspired in Goethe's Faust, like he was a "modern version" of him. Great allusion! Faust has boring job and an ordinary life, but all of that changes when he sells his soul (voluntarily or not) to a witch and now can fulfil his desires. Each wish granted takes away a part of his soul and that can self-destruct him. Soon, Faust noticed that he will have to find a way to get rid of the witch so he can keep his soul and return to his normal and pacific life.\n\nGive it a try, you probably won't regret it!","April 20","true","10.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Your life is boring, your job is just decent enough to pay the bills and nothing exciting is going on. That is, until you met someone who can give you the chance to change your life at the cost of your soul.\n\nSoul Gambler is a very short game that plays like a comic book/graphic novel. As you advance in the story you will have new ways of increasing or decreasing your soul. You can buy an easy way out from some dull activities or you can put yourself in a better situation at the cost of a little percentage of your soul. It may be possible for you to meet your soulmate, getting in a fight or witness the loss of someone you may know. It will all be depending on the choices you make.\n\nThere’s isn’t much more to be said about Soul Gambler. You can finish the game in about one hour and there’s some replay value if you want to see a different ending or make different decisions through the chapters. I purchased Soul Gambler at the 2015 Steam Summer Sale and it was well worth the price I paid for.\n\nThe music is relaxing and quite simple, same as the gameplay elements as you just need to click in order for the conversations to proceed as well making your choices when they appear. If you just want a quick game to play for a couple of hours with no difficulty attached at all I recommend giving Soul Gambler a fair chance.\n","June 26, 2015","true","2.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I played through the game a couple times and it was easy to see that the choices you were allowed to make had little impact in the direction of the story.  Meanwhile, you are prevented from making decisions that could change the direction of the story in a meaningful way.  Think of Soul Gambler as an interactive story similar to The Walking Dead except much, much shorter.  My first playthrough was only an hour long.\n\nThe story itself is compelling, filled with alternate realities, moral choices, and a sexy seductress reminiscent of the movie Bedazzled.  You start off dividing six points between four stats: Strength, Intelligence, Manipulation, and Charm.  You can also choose to play the game in English or Portuguese.  After that, the game begins.\n\nSoul Gambler was interesting enough to keep me playing to the end.  You can also get "achievements" for completing the different directions the story takes you.  One thing that put me off was you were often lied to in the story.  In spite of being told (frequently) that you could never give up part of your soul unless you wanted to, I found the opposite was true in a number of cases.\n\nI give it a hesitant recommendation for those who want an interactive story in a comic format.  Is one hour worth of content enough to get you to buy this?  The choice is yours.","July 18, 2014","true","1.6"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

It is not so much about an game-experience but self-experience. It is an touching game if you take your time and just do what you would do by having the same choices and chances as the main character has. You figure out luck and waste chances while you are trying to find out why you are in your position in the first place.\n\nThe contra-side:\nAs charming as the game is, you will need to run through the game again, having the knowledge you haven't had before and that is making your choices become more or less incorrect to what you would do usually. Therefore you are only trying to break your own destiny. You are desperately searching for the best outcome and I bet you will make it all worse.\n\nMy thought:\nThis game is art and not really gaming. The clicking of up to 4 possible answers/reactions on any given moment will change your personal outcome and represent how miserable your life is. It is deep, hard and true.\n\nSo:\nAs I said before, I like games like this. The almost everlasting run for the best possible ending on the other hand turns games like this into an mountain you can never climb up on to see what would happen by the change of every single choise. It would just take to long. But as morbid and macabre entertaiment it is.. I will surely give it at least one or two more runs and see what may change in the end.\n\nRecomended to "Story-Based"-Gamers 9/10","September 14, 2014","true","9.1"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","1"

If you bear with it, there are interesting moments, even if just to see what the writers had in mind.\n\nWhat first caught my eye was, of course, the the incredibly sexy red-head hanging over Faust's shoulder. The art style really appeals to me and I love that the graphical user interface and scene composition is made up of comic book elements! The characters are mildly interesting but ultimately it's this red head, and her presence changing the scenes to macabre versions of themselves, which kept me playing.\n\nNow, the story has some serious moments and some of the explanatory options do satisfy my curiosity, but overall the dialogue feels strange to me: "I couldn't understand this entire situation." for example. The few atmospheric NPCs (doctor, flight attendant, your boss) are not using lingo fit for their professions: "Keep yourself quiet. You need to rest. I've requested more exams to better understand your health status and what happened to you." It's not intolerable and can be amusing. One solid gripe I'll offer is my annoyance with the repetitive music, which loops itself far too quickly.\n\nI haven't played any other game (so far) that involved making choices around gambling/bargaining your soul off and while there aren't an awful lot of long-drawn out or creative choices, there's just enough content to appropriately play out the story.\n\nSome WTF moments. The girls were hot (except one crazy ratchet ho'). It most certainly satisfied me. If you're as hungry as I am for artsy visual novels and don't mind a cheap thrill, this might be for you.

I won't get into details but the tale is about mystery and romance and the manuscript is quite pleasant. This is not a child feature though because there is some drugs and murders included.\n\nThe chances to affect in tale are various and it should take 5 or 6 times to see every possible dialogue and event. The diversity of storyline is achived with the decision crossroads and four different attributes chosen in a beginning.  Although 'all roads lead to Rome' - the choices made aren't remarkable. No matter how you played your cards you are more or less chained to follow the main agenda.\n\nThe graphically well drown Soul Gambler might not be the long lasting joy taking only 1 hour to complete, but the decision points add some re-play value for as long as player is not annoyed of already seen events.\n\nIn my opinion Soul Gambler is good for its price and great when on sale.

Some story elements were left too vauge or completely unexplained, unless that was my fault for clicking through too fast on a couple occasions due to impatience of multiple runthroughs.

I won't get into details but the tale is about mystery and romance and the manuscript is quite pleasant. This is not a child feature though because there is some drugs and murders included.\n\nThe chances to affect in tale are various and it should take 5 or 6 times to see every possible dialogue and event. The diversity of storyline is achived with the decision crossroads and four different attributes chosen in a beginning.  Although 'all roads lead to Rome' - the choices made aren't remarkable. No matter how you played your cards you are more or less chained to follow the main agenda.\n\nThe graphically well drown Soul Gambler might not be the long lasting joy taking only 1 hour to complete, but the decision points add some re-play value for as long as player is not annoyed of already seen events.\n\nIn my opinion Soul Gambler is good for its price and great when on sale. A good title in evergrowing family of visual-novels.","September 9, 2015","true","4.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You start the game by choosing to put points in four categories: Strength, Persuasion, Charisma and Intelligence. Basic gameplay involves choosing from a list of dialogue or actions. Stat checks during the story will often allow you to make special choices that will affect the game.\n\nI've only completed 1 playthrough as of writing this review, which took about 30 minutes. There are a variety of achievements to earn which show that your choices will have some effect on the outcome. This game was entertaining enough that I want to play through differently just to see how it changes.\n\nThe graphics are well drawn and nice to look at. The sound is a little boring and doesn't add much to the gameplay. The writing kept me interested throughout, and made me want to give it another play.\n\nThe big downside is the length. The playthrough took about 30 minutes, and I imagine another playthrough would be shorter since I could skip through a lot of the repetitive dialogue. Looking at the list of achievements, there don't appear to be enough endings to require more than 2-3 playthroughs. So, about 90 minutes of gameplay is all you will get out of this. It's fun while it lasts, but definitely think about your budget when making the purchase. Whatever 90 minutes of entertainment is worth to you, that's how much I'd spend.\n\nI recommend this game, but do keep it mind the short length.

The wrong words are often used or words are in the wrong order. This could be due to a bad translation or just a large oversight of the story text included. While playing I just assumed it was the former and was able to read through the numerous errors and still enjoy myself.\n\nThe story has many different branching paths and a few rather constant ones. I ended up playing the game to completion about two times reading most of the text. From there it was situation more of: rapidly clicking until I could make an alternate choice, reading that story excerpt, and repeating.\n\nIn summation I think this game is worth playing once or twice.

The biggest issues I have with the game involve the abundant misspellings and broken sentences; perhaps the English version was translated and not proofread.  It becomes greatly annoying after having to read the same incorrect sentences over and over again since, after all, the game needs to be played through several times to aquire all of the achievements.

The art is decent and conjured nostalgic memories of Comix Zone on the Sega Genesis (despite it just being panel art in this case).\n\nSoul Gambler is riddled with a deluge of grammar mistakes. The wrong words are often used or words are in the wrong order. This could be due to a bad translation or just a large oversight of the story text included. While playing I just assumed it was the former and was able to read through the numerous errors and still enjoy myself.\n\nThe story has many different branching paths and a few rather constant ones. I ended up playing the game to completion about two times reading most of the text. From there it was situation more of: rapidly clicking until I could make an alternate choice, reading that story excerpt, and repeating.\n\nIn summation I think this game is worth playing once or twice. After that I couldn't reccomend it for anything other than it's easy achievements and experiencing the minutia of the story branches.","December 20, 2015","true","5.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Trading cards, trading cards, trading cards!\n2. Easily 100%-able achievements!\n3. An interesting story, akin to an interactive comic book.\n\nCons:\n1.  Your choices do change some of the story's incidentals, but the main part of it is unchanged... even the ending is for the most part unchanged!  Incidentals are different, but each end involves a certain character getting a knife in the gut (no, not Faust, play the game for yourself to see)\n2. Biggest con of the game: Once you beat the game in any way on that save file, it autosaves and restarts you to the very beginning: no saving before the end to see most of the endings for you!  Full playthroughs all the way!  (Those incidental changes, while being incidental to the plot, are still fun to watch, especially the one where you end with over 100% soul!  =^_^=)\n\nThat being said, this game is simplistic but enjoyable, and feels like a computer-sized interactive comic book!\n\nSIDENOTE: The story is good and an interesting spin on the whole Faust storyline, but has only the vaguest most tenuous connections to the real story of Faust!

I completed the game in one sitting, which took a little less than an hour.\n\nIf you like reading, interactive visual novels, and decision trees, then you will really enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are fantastic, the are is very well-done and each scene contains a lot of detail. The music and sounds (ambient background noise) is also great, however, I noticed that the game's audio looping could use some work (it is very obvious when the tracks are starting over again). Note that I like to dj/mix in my spare time, so I particularly look out for this in videogames if it's obvious enough. The music changes with the scenery, and during "Dark World" scenes - which can occur and conclude very quickly - the music will react accordingly; this aspect of the game is very well-done.\n\nThe controls are very simple, you are just clicking on dialogue/decision options with your mouse. The learning curve is minimal, and the concept/theme of the game is explained to your very close to the beginning of gameplay.\n\nYour character is offered a "pact" that will allow him to barter off percentages of his soul for wishes. The percentage of the soul to be used as payment is determined by how critical the wish is to your character. For example, making your bus show up early costs 3% of your soul, while discovering the answer to ancient questions will require 200% of your soul (otherwise impossible). You are given many opportunities to use trade parts of your soul for wishes, and finding out all the possibilities adds to the replayability of the game.\n\nGranted, most of the decision trees have few long-term consequences; however, there are multiple endings, and obtaining each one depends on your precise decisions during key moments in the game. The game is fairly linear, but the journey - especially your first playthrough - can be very enjoyable if you like story-driven games and interactive fiction. After one or two playthroughs, you will be able to just breeze through most of the game by repeatedly clicking your mouse until you reach the crtitical decision points in the game.\n\nYou are given "skill" points to distribute in the beginning of the game, and your score for each skill (athletics/health, social/manipulation, intelligence, and charisma) will influence some of the encounters and outcomes in the game.\n\nThere are achievements for the 100% completion junkies, and this requires multiple playthroughs. Since you ALWAYS have to start from a fresh game after reaching the end (you cannot just save near the end of the game and keep loading to view different endings), Achieving 100% can take at least an extra hour on top of your total playtime.\n\nIf you are interested in the theme of using your soul as a bartering tool, visual novels, and text-heavy gameplay, then you should give Soul Gambler a try.\n\nRecommend!\n\nIf you like this review, please consider checking out DJSF's Rogue Reviews Steam Group for more in-depth reviews","August 8, 2014","true","3.3"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Albeit if you're savvy, it is quite obvious what you must not do in the game.\n\nThe story has a lot of potential as it empathises the amount of 'choice' you have in it regarding how you sell Faust's soul and how much you can influence the story.\n\nHowever I say potential because at times it feels lacking, Faust ultimately has to go through some of the same scenarios no matter what you choose and your options on what Faust sells his soul for are limited. It would be nice if there were more diverges in the story-route and unfortunately there are no game overs as you play through. (Unless you count the bad endings as such)\n\nThe art has a comic-book style which is nice to look at and the soundtrack was fitting.\n\nThe game has good replayability if you want to get the achievements and see the multiple endings but progress is slowed because there is no option to skip and you can't save the game and reload at specific points. For example at the final choices, once you complete a cycle of the game you have to start from the beginning instead of reloading and seeing the ending the other choice gives you.\n\nHowever, whilst I'm critical of the game, it is still good and is worth a couple of hours. For the price it is worth it and you can also wait for a sale and then the price of the game is basically a steal.","August 2, 2015","true","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Giving the option to stall the story is a risk and they solved it very well, and make you not pay attention or forget about other times when the game does not give that option.\nThe story change according to your options, of course some characters are unavoidable, but playing more than once you can see how different Faust could handle the whole thing and how different the ending could be.\nI think this game is a great example of how to make a short but well done game on a budget, good example of how to handle choices given to the player and commit to the path chosen by the decisions taken (not allowing just cosmetic choices, but choices that change the player's experience).","August 2, 2015","true","1.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Soul Gambler presents interesting choices that lead to different scenes and scenarios, including multiple endings. The 'soul gambling' mechanic and basic RPG statistic elements that lead to different options are well implemented and choices lead to poignant and rewarding consequences. As it is a short game and various play styles and choices can evoke a unique feel to the story, multiple playthroughs are recommended.\n\nSoul Gamber possesses interesting characterization especially considering the brevity of the game, a beautiful comic art style, with the only minor hiccups being some of the technical implementation of the music (and each loop's length) and some rough translations (being originally written in Portuguese). An incredible bargain even when not on sale, highly recommended for fans of adventure games, RPGs, visual novels and/or classic literature.","August 29, 2015","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And while I really wanted to like it, I could immedlately tell that it wouldn't be for me.\n\nThis game butchers the English language. Everything is poorly and awkwardly written. People do not speak like that in English - it's hard to get into a game when all you can think the whole time you're playing is "nobody ever speaks like that." It's too bad they didn't bother with having the text reviewed by a native English-speaker.\n\nIf you're fine with extremely poor grammar in a text-based game, feel free to give it a shot but I just had to leave this feedback - it's hard to believe most people are fine with this. Oh well.\n\nEdit: I've finished the game - and I did have a pretty good time with it. The poor grammar actually makes the game unintentionally funny. If you can get the game for a couple bucks like I did, you could do worse with your money.

Despite having multiple paths and endings, I found myself growing bored skipping through mostly repeated dialogue.

Some of the writing and storytelling can be a hint bland at times, but it is made up for at other points. The art is quite good from the comicbook style and manages some unique locations and scenarios which would be harder in another medium. Despite having multiple paths and endings, I found myself growing bored skipping through mostly repeated dialogue. For one to three playthroughs it's very good, but to get all of the endings, it could get tedious. The ideas and imagination in this game is the best part of the whole thing. The choices and how they change the story in small or large ways are a close second.\n\nEntertainment Value: 9/10\nReplay Value: 6/10\nStory: 7/10\nArt: 7/10\nOverall: 8/10","December 30, 2015","true","3.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(I paid 79cents U.S. for a combo of this and an Early Access game called "Face it")\n\nThis is an excellent visual novel loosely based on Goethe's Faust. The art is excellent, the writing is 1st rate, and the experience is full of choices to be made letting you guide Faust in the direction you want.\n\nI thought I might like it when I saw the gamepage, but I didn't think I would enjoy it so much...this is absolutely the biggest pleasant surprise as far as "sleepers" go that I've had in a long time. What is even cooler is that it was produced by a small team in Brazil so I also got the chance to support a project made by Devs working out of a sense of love for the project who were able to stay close to their Artistic vision without big-time outside interference. (The English version is translated from the Portuguese so there are occasional, small oddities but the translation overall is excellent)\n\nBUY THIS!","January 2","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Again, like with the art, there is a simplicity to the music, but in the best way possible.

You play as Faust, a guy with a boring life who is one day given a tempting offer of selling pieces of his soul for favors in return. Well, you're forced to accept the offer in the end anyway.\nApart from that, you're given plenty of choices that will change how the story plays out from beginning to end.\nThe story is pretty intriguing, but short and sweet. A single playthrough would last about an hour or less, depending on your reading & clicking skills.

The music is not good, however, and beyond being simply repetitious and uninspired, it does not cleanly loop and digital clipping is audible upon said looping.\nThe story is the primary focus of the game here, and it is really pretty solid. The sheer number of choices the player has to make will guarantee the need to replay the game multiple times to see all possible storylines and locations. A first run of the game will take an hour or so, and depending how into the game you are, that time may double or triple as you explore other choices. The game actually tracks what percentage of it you have seen, so you can gauge how much is left for you to hunt down.\n\nIf you can catch this game on sale (I got it for $0.29), I'd recommend it. It has achievements and cards, and if you sell your cards you can almost recoup the cost of the game in its entirety.","September 1, 2015","true","3.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The first thing is that, if you are looking for a "choose your own aventure" type of game/VN, then this is really a bad one for you, because the game is not making any effort to let you identify yourself as the main character. It doesn't give you the amount of choices and freedom to feel & empathize with your character.\n\nOn the other hand... the game do tell an interesting story. The lack of choices and freedom are somewhat justified and understandable once we finish the game and get the "moral of the story". However, it is sad that the story is not more developed, and lots of potential are unexploited...\n\nI would recommend this game to lovers of VN who crave for a decent title. But if you are looking for a memorable experience/story, i think there are better titles...\n\n:tl,dr: 6/10, interesting story, but lack of depth and choices.","March 7, 2015","true","2.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

For some it will be nothing, for others everything, and those in between uncertain of the morality of it all. Anyway, you'll have to play in order to find out for yourself what kind of person you are.\n\nThis game is a visual novel set into a somewhat comic book style that interacts based on how you interacts with it, but it has linear points whereas you will see the same cutscene no matter what action you took, but the actions you take will effect the ending of each episode and the future of the game.\n\nMy Play Through	I played the game through twice fixing what I made a mistake of doing the first time. My first playthrough my protagonist felt very empty as the life he lived meaningless linking me to the achievement, "Happy?"\n\nAmazingly, this is also how I feel in life as i'm still a college student waiting to get their life started after finishing their degree. If someone asked me, "if I was happy?" I wouldn't know what to say, but if prompted further I would probably say, "not really."\n\nThe second playthrough was fulfilling as I took a completely different set of actions with the correction in mind, though I had also done something I would consider morally wrong as a result of my other actions. I believe the ending of my second playthrough was the best possible ending you could get. I won't spoil it, but overall it was an enjoyable yet short experience.\n\nI hope the game will eventually come out with a voice over version, though sadly it may never happen.","August 13, 2014","true","1.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shoggofu/recommended/313020/","shoggofu","YouTube shoggofu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shoggofu/","257 products in account","Final word:\n\nSince my first original first impressions post (see below) I have completed the game.\n\n(conclusion to let's play footage - as requested)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNt3VoBdUis\nThe ending wasn't much further past where I left off in my first video. So the game is short. But I just wanted keep on going. I really liked it. I wish that it was longer. On my save it actually says that I have only concluded 37%. But what happens when you get to the end is that you are able to continue from the start of the game again. So that percentage value from what I can gather isn't so how far you have gotten through the game but of all the different options you could have taken what percentage of them you have made. But I don't want to go through all the same scenes again just so I can raise that number. I liked original path that I took and I played that I wanted to play.\n\nFirst impressions:\n\nI've played the game for about 35 minutes so far. Out of the four games I looked at today it was easily the most fun.\n\n(optional let's play footage)\nhttp://youtu.be/QSoMEGHIDN4\nThe game look's pretty good. When it says graphic novel it really means it. There doesn't seem to any animation at all. I like it. The gameplay relies heavily on the dialogue which have to read.\n\nStarting off you actually get to choose the protagonist's attributes i.e. level of physical strength, intelligence, charisma and so on. These determine the success of certain actions e.g. you need adequate strength to fend off a brute or good charisma to get information from characters. As the game progresses you are presented with various situations where you are tempted to sell your soul in exchange to manipulate reality in a way that benefits you. You start with 100% soul and the price for changing reality is offered as a percentage usually 10%.\n\nI like how can you customize the attributes of your character. You can't make them all high. I think it adds to the variety of gameplay and potentially the replayability of the game. You can be a physically weak person who is adapt at manipulating people or someone who is average in most areas but really tough (this is what I chose). Not being very charismatic I sucked at convincing people to provide information to assist with an investigation but because of my strength I was able to fend off a thug. The game is all about making choices, do I sell my soul for this or that, do I skip a day at work to or track someone down, do I cooperate with this person. Your life seems to be manipulated those who want you sell your soul in order to tempt you to do so. For example after refusing to sell your soul you conveniently fall very ill and come close to dying. You are offered to be healed in exchange for a fraction of your soul. However if you continue to refuse you eventually make a full recovery mysteriously. I stubbornly refused to sell any of my soul at all. The way some offers are made to you kind are sort of reminiscent of receiving phone calls from telemarketers 'for just 10% of your soul you can turn your boss into a camel' lol. I enjoyed just saying no to every offer. I really felt engaged in the narrative. You don't who to trust, who is really good or whether someone apparently trustworthy really has ulterior motives.\n\nSo far I would definitely recommend this game. One of the things I liked most about it was that no matter what you always seem to have the option to stubbornly refuse to sell any of your soul. I was even able to not skip going to work and agreeing to work late at a job which my character hated and thought was completely boring. So basically I played a stubborn boring character lol\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","July 10, 2014","true","1.3"," 21 of 40 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","21","40","0","2"

The game gives you plenty of choices to choose from and every one of the choices are worth checking out. The biggest problem I had with the game is the soul mechanic. I’m not going to spoil what is wrong with the soul mechanic for those who haven’t played yet. I’ll just say that I tried a run where I tried to spend as much of my soul as possible to see what happens.

It might even be worth the full $3!\n\nSo you play some shmoe who gains the ability to sell parts of his soul for supernatural favors. The art is a nice comic book look that's better than all of the bargain bin visual novels on Steam. You have an icon showing how much of your soul you have left, and 4 stats.\n\nAsweome! This is going to be a nifty time/resource management sim with a neat storytelling twist, right?\n\nNope not really. The stats barely come into play. As far as I can tell they just alter dialog choices. If you fail a stat check trying to do something, you just end up accomplishing it some other way.\n\nSo you manage your soul stat, right?\n\nAgain, not really. The main problem is, the "tempting" offers to sell your soul are just lame. You would think offers to sell your soul would involve becoming a rock star, famous actor, superstar athlete, or billionaire. So what are the offers in the game? Sell a chunk of your soul to finish a night's worth of paperwork at your dead end job? Make a bus arrive a couple minutes early? Find out someone's apartment number? I'm not joking the majority of soul selling offers are that lame. The closest any comes to tempting is 15% of your soul to bang a tatted up hipster chick you meet at a bar. Satan, dude, she aint THAT hot! You almost expect to come across Homer Simpson selling his entire soul for a donut...\n\nIt's still an amusing hour to spend for a buck. It's just a shame the story is so short, linear, and the faustian bargains are so lame that they couldn't tempt squat. This game would have been a lot better off ditching the linear story (which ends before it even gets going) and going for more of a dating sim time/stat management deal, selling chunks of your soul to cheat the system. There is some definite creative talent going on with the developer, and it's worth keeping an eye on them for future games.","November 9, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have to say the game is amazing, the story is pretty good although if you don't have certain points at times you'll go through wondering whats going on. Every point in the game where you sell your soul is optional however it can be extremely useful at points. Plus all of the offers are tempting to take on. When you pick your attributes it seems like the limited number of points would be a downside but the point system only takes one or two points to turn the tides on a check. I do have to say though that the ending I got (the best one on my first playthrough) left me wanting more, hoping there'd be more to the story, which left me disappointed when there was no more. all in all though, this game is great if you find it on a sale like I did its definitely worth it.  8/10","November 22, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are basically given the power to make your wishes come true, but at the expense of your own soul. A mystery unravels as to the reason this happened, and what you are going to do about it. The plot was interesting, the writing was good, the graphics/animation and music were good as well. My only real complaint is you are basically given unlimted power, but you are never given the chance to use it, outside of mundane things like "would you like to use your power to make your work day shorter?". At one point, someone states you have the power to do things like turn your evil boss into a camel. Why sure, let's do that. But no, that's not a choice you are given.

There is a lot of replay value, stemming from choices made based on your stats (Health/Manipulation/Intelligence/Charisma) and decisions.  I do enjoy seeing Faust explain the universe of the game when his intelligence is high. However, it is weird that there are typos for charisma and intelligence when you set stats, but otherwise I think the spelling/grammar is good.\n\nI enjoyed selling my soul and seeing the Steam achievements based on the results I would get from my decisions. Only thing I didn't like is you couldn't branch out your saves, so you will repeat a lot of dialogue on different playthroughs rather than just save at a choice and replay it with the other choice and not repeating the entire game beforehand.\n\nI will explain a few things (spoilers) about how playthroughs differ.  The main story may not change (no premature game overs), but your choices like forcing your soulmate to love you by selling your soul only to lose interest in a soulless version of her and stats (you'll hear a sound effect with whatever stat is affected in the plot) can make things branch out quite a bit, though you can't skip scenes you've been through before.  Abusing your soul will also hinder your gambit to get out of jail or fight to escape the ritual at the end.

The game gives you plenty of choices to choose from and every one of the choices are worth checking out. The biggest problem I had with the game is the soul mechanic. I’m not going to spoil what is wrong with the soul mechanic for those who haven’t played yet. I’ll just say that I tried a run where I tried to spend as much of my soul as possible to see what happens.

It might even be worth the full $3!\n\nSo you play some shmoe who gains the ability to sell parts of his soul for supernatural favors. The art is a nice comic book look that's better than all of the bargain bin visual novels on Steam. You have an icon showing how much of your soul you have left, and 4 stats.\n\nAsweome! This is going to be a nifty time/resource management sim with a neat storytelling twist, right?\n\nNope not really. The stats barely come into play. As far as I can tell they just alter dialog choices. If you fail a stat check trying to do something, you just end up accomplishing it some other way.\n\nSo you manage your soul stat, right?\n\nAgain, not really. The main problem is, the "tempting" offers to sell your soul are just lame. You would think offers to sell your soul would involve becoming a rock star, famous actor, superstar athlete, or billionaire. So what are the offers in the game? Sell a chunk of your soul to finish a night's worth of paperwork at your dead end job? Make a bus arrive a couple minutes early? Find out someone's apartment number? I'm not joking the majority of soul selling offers are that lame. The closest any comes to tempting is 15% of your soul to bang a tatted up hipster chick you meet at a bar. Satan, dude, she aint THAT hot! You almost expect to come across Homer Simpson selling his entire soul for a donut...\n\nIt's still an amusing hour to spend for a buck. It's just a shame the story is so short, linear, and the faustian bargains are so lame that they couldn't tempt squat. This game would have been a lot better off ditching the linear story (which ends before it even gets going) and going for more of a dating sim time/stat management deal, selling chunks of your soul to cheat the system. There is some definite creative talent going on with the developer, and it's worth keeping an eye on them for future games.","November 9, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are basically given the power to make your wishes come true, but at the expense of your own soul. A mystery unravels as to the reason this happened, and what you are going to do about it. The plot was interesting, the writing was good, the graphics/animation and music were good as well. My only real complaint is you are basically given unlimted power, but you are never given the chance to use it, outside of mundane things like "would you like to use your power to make your work day shorter?". At one point, someone states you have the power to do things like turn your evil boss into a camel. Why sure, let's do that. But no, that's not a choice you are given.

There is a lot of replay value, stemming from choices made based on your stats (Health/Manipulation/Intelligence/Charisma) and decisions.  I do enjoy seeing Faust explain the universe of the game when his intelligence is high. However, it is weird that there are typos for charisma and intelligence when you set stats, but otherwise I think the spelling/grammar is good.\n\nI enjoyed selling my soul and seeing the Steam achievements based on the results I would get from my decisions. Only thing I didn't like is you couldn't branch out your saves, so you will repeat a lot of dialogue on different playthroughs rather than just save at a choice and replay it with the other choice and not repeating the entire game beforehand.\n\nI will explain a few things (spoilers) about how playthroughs differ.  The main story may not change (no premature game overs), but your choices like forcing your soulmate to love you by selling your soul only to lose interest in a soulless version of her and stats (you'll hear a sound effect with whatever stat is affected in the plot) can make things branch out quite a bit, though you can't skip scenes you've been through before.  Abusing your soul will also hinder your gambit to get out of jail or fight to escape the ritual at the end. In a way, this is a sandbox game, and worth a try for its uniqueness.","September 12, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love the artwork in this game and the characters really make it come alive. It has re-playability value too. The story is well written and I could not stop playing just to see what my choices would do and see what happened next.\n\nThis game made me think about things. Deep things. Suicide. Soul Mates. Having depression all my life, it had a really different take on suicide I never thought of before. I've been with my Soul Mate for over 7 years, but it posed the question about having more than one Soul Mate? Possible? I think so now. But I love my girl and am happy, and that's all I need. But there might be more out there somewhere.\n\nGot this game off of a coupon making a badge, best coupon game ever! I couldn't believe how good of a game it was. I need to play through it again to get different achievements and make different choices. This is a really fun game.\n\n10/10 - Would have sex with my Soul Mate again to get part of my Soul back.","December 17, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some of the choices you can make help to bypass parts of the game you just aren't interested in. I, myself, skipped the whole "soulmate" scenario. i wasn't sold on the idea and thought the soulmate character wasn't that interesting. I was thankful for the option to leave her out of the story.\n\nSeveral achievements to go after which require multiple playthoughs. on the second playthough i found myself just spamming the mouse button to get to selecting major choices. I'd recommend saving towards the end and just re-uploading the last save to experience the multiple endings unless you wanted to select other options mid game.\n\nOne con i did find annoying was that the music/sound would often cut out which required restarting the game. not sure if i was the only one to experience this\n\nOverall Soul Gambler is a nice game to lose a couple of hours to.","June 14, 2015","true","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And for other persons too, but only if you are ready to pay 10% of your soul. Surely, I bought this game on the sale ( - 90% ), and it was nice to enjoy it. Yeah, I`ve got different endings only twice, but there are also lots of opportunities to finish the game in the other ways. Let`s review its all advantages and disadvantages.\n\nFirstly, the story of the remaked poem is interesting and full of different unexpectable moments. Most of decisions can be well-done depending on chosen skills of Faust. Anyway, it was fun and improved quality of my emotions about playing.\nI must admit that it`s good to build your own version of Faust, and for discovering his character it`s better to finish game a lot.\nSecondly, don`t be afraid of wasting some power of the soul for making wishes come true. The first time I made this mistake, but the second time I was more hedonistic.\n\nFrankly speaking, there are some disadvanteges, which are important to be written there.\nThe game is only for an hour. If you are not liker of such short type of games, it will be better not to download Soul Gambler. Personally I don`t see this like a con.\n\nYour modern young man Faust has his own personality, and sometimes you have only to read his dialogues with others without chances to do a choice.\n\nSo, I want to give a mark for this product. It will be 8 of 10, but remember that I`m sceptic.","July 14, 2015","true","3.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But as you go for more achivements you begin to realize the flaws within Soul Gambler. Now I only consider these flaws since I've played a few Japanese visual novels, and elements from those games are missing here.\n\nI can't really think of many GOOD points for this game.\n-Art is good.\n-Music is okay and fits the atmosphere just fine.\n-It's short.\n\nWhat I didn't like about Soul Gambler. (BAD)\na-Some decisions didn't really matter.\nb-The mouse is the only way to prgress.\nc-No skip feature.\nd-Autosave\n\na-The choices feel like a forest path you can't stray away from. Occasionally there are two paths, one will take you out of the forest, the other path will lead into the first out of the forest... why?\n\nb-Since there's no way to skip text you're constantly clicking and there's no keyboard function as an alternate control. (a feature strangely missing)\n\nc- Skipping text feels slow since it transitions to each frame by fading, so clicking faster doesn't matter. There is also no feature that skips already read text. (a feature commonly seen in current visual novels.)\n\nd-Now this is the worst. Autosave can make or break games, and you DON'T, put Autosave in a visual novel. If you wanted to see what the other route looked like, you had to play through the whole thing again because it Autosaves at every chapter. It also doesn't help that you can't restart the savestate to the begining without losing your save file. So if you started with stats you're unhappy with, well too bad, either start on another file or finish the game again.\n\nWrap It Up!\nPlaying through the game normally and naturally is fine. Achivement hunting is when the game starts to stagger and fall short of expectations. Now from what I feel the developers were aiming for more of an adventure feel, but it in a visual novel format it becomes too story heavy and there isn't enough weight to throw around. It also feels like their first visual novel so I'm criticizing this too hard. Now I know I went over the bad points a little too much, but Soul Gambler does have it's charms as it is one of the few Visual Novels I've enjoyed that wasn't from Japan.\n\nToo long?\nJust buy it if you're looking for something to just pick up and enjoy.","June 30, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I am happy to report that this has finally been addressed with what I believe was a new programming team if I understand things correctly.\n\nAnyway, I was pleased to finally be able to play this game, and it was actually quite enjoyable, so in this case, it was well worth the wait. It's an interactive novel presented in comic book fashion, with the page frames and such. The artwork is quality. You would expect to see this published by a larger comic company if it was in paper form due to the excellent artwork and coloring. The story was also well written and engaging, and in fact, there seem to be many variations on how this tale can play out, so it carries a choose your own adventure style to it as well. You start out with some very basic RPG options which impact your choices later. There aren't upgrades or anything....whatever you choose is what you stick with, although your choices may end up adjusting some of the stats as part of the story.\n\nThere are some issues with the actual script itself, such as poor sentence structure at certain points (much like my writing here in this review, lol). It seems like English may not have been the original language for this script, and the translation was solid with just a few blemishes. Anyway, nothing major, but you will notice it when you read through the text.\n\nThe OST was quite nice, and appropriate to the theme of the game as well.\n\nAll told, I think I give this game an 8 out of 10 surprisingly, and I would encourage people to read the more recent reviews when making a determination as to whether or not you might purchase this game, as the technical issues that caused a lot of the negative reviews have been solved at this point.","May 30, 2015","true","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I picked this game up because of the "RPG" tag. That tag really shouldn't be there, since there's literally no RPG aspect to the "Game" aside from a few stats.

A lot is left unexplained, and it feels more like the beginning of a series than a standalone game (although I have no idea if there will be any sequels). There are a few possible paths, but so far as I can tell they all lead to the same points eventually, which may limit replayability for some people. It's also important to note that there are technical issues that have kept several people from being able to play the Steam version of the game, and the fix that was promised last year has still not been released. The publisher has made a web version of the game available to anyone who's purchased it on Steam and had these issues, but that may not be an acceptable solution to everyone http://steamcommunity.com/games/313020/announcements/detail/193974105988622121","January 25, 2015","true","4.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Faust is a young man who is suddenly faced with the possibility of turning his boring life around by making some shady deals off his soul. It may not be the story of the year, but it is well told and kept interesting throughout the game.\n\nCharacters: Faust, contrary to some main characters I've had the displeasure to withstand, is likable and amusing. All the other characters such as the Guide (the red head), Peg and especially the green eyed man are brought to life with very interesting and obviously well thought out designs. Dimension and detail was given to the characters without overdoing it - and both their dialogues and reactions were made believable as well.\n\nVisuals: This game, as seen on the screenshots, has a very nice (and well done) cartoonish style to it. The backgrounds are full of detail and the style adopted is a likeable one - plus the "dark reality" is very interesting on the details too. The downside, however, is that, near the very end, the characters seem rushedly drawn.\n\nGameplay: Your choices alter your consequences - and that's the core mechanic of the game. I felt a little bit of an unbalance here, since most choices lead to seeing the same things. The ending might change, but what you have to go through is very similar in all of them.\n\nAchievements: Annoying to get as all end achievements need a replay to get. Saving the game file and then reloading on crucial points has to be done manually if one doesn't want to play the game 5 times or so.\n\nArtbook & Soundtrack: As an artist, I found the artbook definitely worth it. The soundtrack, however, is actually annoying to listen to once you've played the game one so many times as myself.\n\nExtra info:\n* The game can be beaten within one hour, but all the achievements require more time (I'd wager some 3 hours or so).\n* This game has trading cards (the downside is that, since they only spawn from 2hrs on, by the time you beat the game you won't have a single card yet).\n* This game is also available in Br-PT (although, being Brazilian myself, I felt the ENG was a more pleasant read).\n\nobs: I bought the Dark Arts edition of the game (that includes artwork and soundtrack) on a sale.","August 29, 2015","true","4.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The RPG elements felt a little tacked on / not as deep as they could have been, but then, the game is short, and what was done with them was commensurate considering.\n\nPlus, the game is still being updated and I saw, in passing, a remark on Steam from the developer stating that a Director's Cut is soon to come(?)\nPlus, looking at the way the game, the DLC and the bundle are priced...

I don't want to give the story away, as that's the entire game. However, the basic idea is that you're given the opportunity at various points in the game to offer a percentage of your soul in return for certain perks. At the outset you can distribute points to four attributes which affect different situations throughout the story by giving you more or less options depending on where you put them. If you lose too much soul, you'll be in trouble, and you don't want to get into situations where your attributes can't help you, so there's some strategy to be had. This also gives replay value, to try out different amounts in attributes as well as trying to make the choices to put yourself into different situations, thereby changing the story and seeing new content. It's a decent little experience for what it is.\n\nHowever, I have some issues with it. The gameplay elements are very shallow. Managing your attribute points and soul percentage are the only real gameplay. The rest is picking your next response or action, which leads to different results sometimes. Sometimes you'll skip events, thinking it will make a difference, when all it does is save time. Sometimes you'll pick different responses only have one or two different replies before going back to the standard story that has to happen. The replay value falls off after about two or three playthroughs because there are certain things that will happen every time and others that will happen most of the time regardless of your choices, so it gets boring to have to skip through dialogue you know already. Plus, there are some typos in the writing. The only reasons to continue playing would be achievement hunting, if you're into that, or trying to see the new content, which isn't worth sitting through so much contet you've already seen. Also, I didn't care for the music in it either.\n\nThere are a few good moments and some good things about this game, but not enough for me to recommend it. It might be fun if you like visual novels and choose your own adventure stuff, but even then the replay value isn't good enough to recommend it. Plus... typos in such a text heavy game are pretty bad, even though I think it was probably a translation issue. I didn't hate it, but it's only worth a few plays. It's fine as a visual novel, with a comic book type quality to it, but as a GAME... it's not much. Even at 3 bucks, it's not worth the time. This is a soft non recommendation mostly because, reviewing it as a game makes it pretty shallow. And yes, I know I gave Sakura Spirit a good review but... come on, it had boobs. Soul Gambler gets a 3/10 for having some good ideas and a bit of fun, but ultimately having little to no replay value and not being much of a game.","April 11, 2015","false","3.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

IE9? oke, i'll try that one on my win 7. i can't install IE10 because i should've update my win 7 with SP 1. which is i need to give extra space around 1-2GB. does it work win .NET 4 & IE9 installed? NOPE\n\nto play this 274MB game (steam version), i need an extra space 6-7 times larger than the game it self if i wanna play it on my win 7. horray!\n\nkapok? nehi :v\ni'm trying to install this game on my friend's win 8. i wanna play this game through steam on win 8. is there any good news after that? yup. while on win 7 i only got "no respon" loading screen with purple background. on win 8, i could pass that loading screen and arrive at main menu then it just stuck there with wierd background soundtrack. another "no respon" screen?\n\noke, i'm done with this "long way to install but too short to play" game.\n\nmessage to any gamedev, DON'T EVEN THINK TO MAKE A GAME UNDER IE.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[UPDATE: april 4th 2015]\nfinally this game are playable for me after an update. click here and there. spent less than 40 minutes, I got good ending but nothing special about the ending.\n\n[CONS:]\nstory are short & cliche. its easy to guess where the scenario would go. it feels like playing a story board instead of a visual novel.\nnothing special with the music. do I subjective about this? well, this is my review box. no option to raise or lowering the volume.\nscreen aren't full. they could make background image to change that big black block on the left & right. some kind of paper background might be better as this game art are comical.\nsave system are just bad. this game are visual novel. but their save system not allowing player to save it for a different branch. you only have ONE save for the whole game. each time you save, it will update your last save. so you should repeat most choices to get to new branch story. especially when there's too much choices in this short game. overwhelming, I would say.\nno keyboard mapping. you could only play this game with mouse. keep clicking this game until it finished. you couldn't change mouse click into enter or other key.\nno skip option. so, you'll shortening your mouse's life span by replaying this game.\n\nno director cut as promised. I can't even see Gaz Blackheart's post whose asking about it at Jan 4 @ 2:55pm ( https://steamcommunity.com/app/313020/discussions/0/627456487082958731/?insideModal=1 ). you could see the original content of the post by google cache. but now they releasing a new game named face it at kickstarter.\n\nI like the director cut more than this one. its more comical\n(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ts_bHLh55mI)\n\n[PROS:]\nartwork: I like it. that's what I want to see from the beginning. comic style visual novel.\nnever crash or stuck in any point of the game again\nthe game dev are seriously fixing the game until it really playable. I appreciate their efforts. almost a year they spent to fix the problem but I'm only play this for about 40 minutes. at least, they're better than son of liberty's game dev. they don't sell prototype at steam.\n\nTL:DR\nI'd like to replay this game just to get to another branch of the story, but I love my mouse and time more than that.\n\ndo I still recommended this game? YES\nI'd recommended you to stay away from this game. unless you'd sacrifice those most of the cons above for almost nothing.","August 8, 2014","true","1.5"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

I'll talk first about the good stuff: the story, the choices you can make, and the art. The music wasn't bad, but it didn't catch my attention either. Now for the negative points: The game is too short, even for it's price. And i know that you can replay the game many times with different choices, but here's the main problem: there aren't many choices that feel really different. Apart from the 5 possible endings, there are less than 10 meaningful choices in the entire game, most of them just to affect the ending you get. All the others are basically a change in dialog. And even different paths have the same outcome. For example, there's a part where you go to jail. Before that, there are at least 4 choices, each seemingly different. But you'll always end up in jail. And replaying the same parts over and over isn't fun. The game isn't terrible, but i think the choices in the game are disappointing, considering that's the only replay value here. And it will get worst with each replay. If you want the game for the story and don't mind a short game, then you're okay. Otherwise, you can try it on sale.

Based on finding romance or trying to get the correct plot option. These games get broing really fast because there is not much in terms of gameplay. I found myself really bored at times skipping through most of the text to pick an option. Some of the character designs were pretty cool but some were just creepy. I think if the characters had voices I think that could have made the game more interesting or if you were able to actually explore. This game is a lot like a choose your path book. a comic book. with music and next to no gameplay. Luckily I got this game super cheap it was short.

I'll talk first about the good stuff: the story, the choices you can make, and the art. The music wasn't bad, but it didn't catch my attention either. Now for the negative points: The game is too short, even for it's price. And i know that you can replay the game many times with different choices, but here's the main problem: there aren't many choices that feel really different. Apart from the 5 possible endings, there are less than 10 meaningful choices in the entire game, most of them just to affect the ending you get. All the others are basically a change in dialog. And even different paths have the same outcome. For example, there's a part where you go to jail. Before that, there are at least 4 choices, each seemingly different. But you'll always end up in jail. And replaying the same parts over and over isn't fun. The game isn't terrible, but i think the choices in the game are disappointing, considering that's the only replay value here. And it will get worst with each replay. If you want the game for the story and don't mind a short game, then you're okay. Otherwise, you can try it on sale. But be warned.","June 24, 2015","false","3.0"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

I'd estimate that I noticed at least one issue per five text boxes. What is the most disappointing with this game is that the endings all converge to the same place. In fact, three of the five endings seem to all happen in the same cutscene with no extra prerequisites. A fourth is added to that same cutscene if you have one condition filled out. It feels unrewarding that most of the endings don't care how you ended up playing the game as there appear to be three default endings rather than having one "bad" ending and making the player work for the others. Your choices had no meaning and it makes the game feel like it was designed for achievement hunting since that's where your desicions matter most.\nThere's definitely more that could have been done with this game as its concept and story are really neat. An improvement that I can suggest is a little more penalty, like say you made a bad decision and you were forced to sell a portion of your soul or face a game over screen (which doesn't seem to exist at all). Also in terms of penalty, some actions should be able to lock you out of a few of the endings if you don't complete their prerequisites in a way that Atlus' Devil Survivor does. That's a game that does multiple endings right.\nThe game does have its good points too. The story felt thought out and it really drew me in personnaly. The mechanic of selling your soul for certain bonuses or to get you out of a bind was interesting, though it was not used frequently enough in my opinion. The ambiant music is also really good, except that the looping sounds a tad bit clunky.\nIf Soul Gambler is on a decent sale, try it out. It is fun for a few coins. However, I do not believe this game in this state is worth its full price.","July 1, 2015","true","4.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Pretty neat little artstyle and I do love my comic books.\nThe story is set in modern times and follows the story of a rather generic man in his boring life when suddently one day something weird and unexpected happens for once in his miserable and predicting life. Suddently everything changed for him.\nI absolutely loved the game, everything felt intriguing and mysterious up until the last chapter. You don't know who to trust, what they really want from you. The game does a spectacular job to make you doubt every single person. I wasn't too fond of the ending but it wasn't bad.\nThe soundtrack is not anything spectacular but it does the job.\nKeep in mind the game is really, really short though. It will take you about 2 and a half hours if you really take your time with it.\n\n\nIt simply is a nice experience to go through and for 39c ? It's a steal.

There is nothing new or excititing in this game story. Cliches meets poor execution all over again, some plot holes here and there, some repetitive dialog and that's it.\nI'm not saying that short stories are bad, or that simple stories are bad. But as I said, in this game, it was poorly executed, so there is nothing interesting here. I for once wont be playing this game again.\n\nChoices(30/100):\nHere the poor execution gets really bad. The game has tons of choices, wich is good, and the stats system is a good feature, it gives a lot of new choices that you can unlock but it becames pointless. Cause almost all of them has no effect or whatsoever on the game progression. Some of the choices actually change things, which is actually a good thing, but it leads to the next problem. The Endings.\n\nEndings(40/100):\nThere are a few endings in this game, some good, some bad, but overall they are pretty similar to each other. And this ruins everything. What is the point of 5 endings if they are almost the same? The few choices that actually chenge something leads you to endings that have so much similarity that it makes you wonder whats the point of the whole thing.\n\nArt(89/100):\nThe art of the game is actually pretty good, and was one of the biggest reasons for me to buy this game, cause it looks good.\n\nMusic(67/100):\nThe music works and that's it. There is no masterpiece or memorables pieces here. It makes a good work.\n\nConclusion(Overall Score: 53/100):\nThe game is short, bland, simple and beautiful. There is nothing impressive here, but it's not a complete failure. If you want a game with a short story, easy to complete, just to waste a little time, maybe you can play this, but there a ton of other games better than this one.\nEven on sale, don't buy it, it's not worth your money","February 9","false","4.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Imagine my surprise when I get through the game with my soul intact because there were no choices interesting enough to be tempting. All the choices were rather mundane things that I could deal with as a mere mortal, and so I decided not to go for them. I thought I'd keep my soul for the "pleasures" I thought would be coming up later, only no interesting choices ever came up. I had to watch Bedazzled, the movie released in 2000 featuring Elizabeth Hurley as the devil in order to get soul selling satisfaction.","February 6","false","11.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It looks impressive up front--it has a nice graphical style, a neat concept, and throws a stat screen at you to make you feel like it'll have some RPGish elements. But like the worst of David Cage or Telltale, what ends up happening is a strictly railroaded plot where very few decisions have any major impact beyond, at most, a stat going up or down. The ending/s is based on a single ending choice combined, possibly, with a single stat value. Outside of that, there's little variation from scene to scene, with major story beats happening no matter how hard you try to derail the plot to something else. Add to that the dull, sometimes poorly translated narration and dialogue and the fact that there's no dialogue-skip option for subsequent playthroughs, and it adds up to a pretty disappointed visual novel experience.","May 13","false","6.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Right now I think the best way to do this is t say that I DO NOT recommend Soul Gambler UNLESS the following is TRUE for you:\n\n- I don't mind spelling/grammar errors in my video games\n- I like choices that have unclear/unexpected reasoning behind their consequences\n- I believe straight-up visual novels can be called adventure games\n- I like replaying a game and experiencing a short storyline (about 30 minutes of gameplay in the form of mainly reading -or being read- text) that undergoes only small (often -but not always- insignificant) changes despite my widely varying choices in binary dialogue branches\n- I like strictly heterosexual romance/relationship options (one male, one female)\n- I like romance stories where my partner is a 2 dimensional character with few defining characteristics\n- I like mystery stories where I don't really have to solve a mystery, it happens automatically despite my choices\n- I don't mind dialogue that doesn't make sense (in general -which I suspect may be translation to English issues, and other times it just makes no sense in the context of the current situation)\n- I like the idea of a mechanic where I choose to use my character's soul as currency to purchase "clues" and then using that insight to make "better" (more informed) choices throughout the story\n- I really liked the art work in the screenshots and videos of the game\n\nThis is just what I think. I personally think the game was worth about $2, and if you're expecting a two dollar game you'll get it. But only if you really do believe most of the above conditions are true for you.

Faust has always lived a boring life, until the day he made the Pact that allowed him to make wishes using part of his soul.\n\nPros: The game is drawn in a comic-book fashion with a peculiar take on the visual style that give it a gloomy, but not too dark atmosphere. You are regularly confronted with a variety of choices that may or may not succeed based on your stats, most of which open entire branching paths that change the story, allowing you to play through it again to try different things\n\nCons: The game is terribly short, and within a few hours you'll have tried every single different paths. The writing isn't all that great, and although there are multiple options, you remain limited within the confines of the game, most likely that the choices will all bring you to the same result.\n\nVerdict: ★★☆☆☆ - Forget it\n\nThe story had me intrigued, but not interested. I was curious enough to try the different paths, and now there's nothing left for me to go back to. This should be a draft for a much broader game. Sure, it's worth its low price, but I don't see who I'd recommend this to.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","June 6, 2015","false","4.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/igtbtg/recommended/313020/","igtbtg","PhineasPoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/igtbtg/","1474 products in account","TL,DR: If you can get past the very awkward translation and don't mind that your choices don't matter that much, Soul Gambler is not bad. It's cheap, the art is nicely done and it has an interesting concept. However, personally, the lack of some key visual novels features (bad save system, no skip option), the mediocre translation, the shortness of the game, the fact that a lot of your choices don't matter very much and flat characters make it difficult to recommend. However, it really comes down to how much regret you'll have over spending $3.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nSoul Gambler is not a bad game, especially for the price. It's a somewhat unique entry in the visual novel genre (at least for what's on Steam) as it features Western-style art and is not a story about falling in love (eh. . .mostly) or going to school. You play a guy, you make a devil deal and get the ability to slice off bits of your soul to trade for things. Things don't go well, because of course they don't.\n\nThe art is great, the premise interesting and the story is somewhat engaging. I found myself wondering what was happening at a few points. These are the good points of the game, the rest is not so good.\n\nThe game is extremely short. This is nice if you like 100% games, but it really hurts a story-centric game. There's no time for any characters to get developed. For instance, your soul-mate. . .don't really know that much about her. Something bad can happen to your friend. It has no impact, because you've know him for about three minutes. All the mysteries of the plot never get time to really breathe. They're brought up and then revealed very quickly. The final reveal is just kind of, "Oh, okay, that's what was going on, huh? All right." The premise is never used to its full potential. Every thing is very self-contained. "Hey, want to sell your soul for this? Yeah? Okay, moving on. Want to sell your soul for this?" It'd be nice to see how more of our character's life is changing and being effected. To get to know people more. To really be intrigued by the plot.\n\nChoices do matter. . .kind of. Sometimes. Usually, they don't. There is two choices during the game that actually have an actual impact. Now, there are a couple choices at the very end that will change things, but, again, those do not come until the very end. Other than that, every other choice is just kind of for flavor. Another aspect of the game that's fairly under-utilized is your stats. There are times when they get used, but they feel very much like an after thought.\n\nThe translation for this game is not great. It's not terrible, I've definitely seen worse, but there are a lot of typos and a lot of very awkward phrasing. Here are some examples: "I'm gonna spend some time on my parents' town." "Confront Hog would be just stupid." "Ask for help to that witch." It's not super distracting, unless you're like me and you're always on the look out for it. However, the stiff writing stands out. Characters speak very formally and often say things that make sense, but the phrasing is very weird. It's not a dealbreaker, but in a visual novel, the novel should be well polished.\n\nFinally, this has problems being a visual novel. There are two key features that are missing:\n1. A good save system- You cannot have multiple saves. There are multiple save slots, but while playing the game, you can only save in one of them. Also, when you finish the game it auto-saves and if you try to load it, you start a new game. So, if you want to see everything you are forced to go through the game multiple times. This made much worse because there is no skip option. Get ready to click a lot to get through it after you have the dialogue memorized.\n\nThis has been a very long review for a very short game. A game that has a lot of problems, but is not that bad. Especially for $3.","August 2, 2015","false","4.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It makes me feel cheated. Like I'm gullible and someone successfully pulled a fast one on me and is laughing their head off. That's what I think the designers of Soul Gambler are thinking now. Free will? Are you kidding me? I tried in one save to get as far away from the witch as possible, but she ended up forcing me to make a pact with the bloody demon!\n\nThis game is incredibly linear. A lot of the same things- emphasis on A LOT- happen in each save. Sure, you may spend your soul on different things, or you may get out of situations differently, but the next scenes or consequences are always the same. And that really grinds my gears. I could ramble on about the free choice system and the strange "RPG" elements in it, but what about the actual game? Okay, here's a good simulation. Just put your finger on your mouse and click it. Over and over again for about thirty minutes. There's the game.\n\nAgain, certain choices and moments in the story are enjoyable, but because it's a lot of the same stuff happening all the time, there's little incentive to go back. But go back I did about five times to find out every bloody secret this game had, and realized just how little the game actually had to offer. Besides the well-drawn scenery and poorly done sound (no voice actors, really? And why does the sound loop stop at the end for a moment before it begins?), it just isn't that immersive. I would've enjoyed it more if my actions had more consequences, or if the story had more variation. And this is a game with no voice actors and just drawings in its design! It'd be damn easy to make a whole new plot from decisions. But we have this. A crappily-put-together game. And, yes, I am bashing it a bit too hard. It does have good things in it. And I hope the developers learn from these errors in the game and make something so much better in the future. But as it stands, the best choose-your-own-adventure games that I've played so far are made by BioWare or TellTale.","July 9, 2015","false","2.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It is probably one of the shortest games I have ever played, but I didn't mind that. I'm assuming that English is not the creator's first language because the grammar was awful during some scenes. I wish the game was a bit more interactive. The only thing you do the entire time is click your mouse which got annoying quickly.

I REALLY like this concept, actually. But the game falls short in too many aspects for me to ever recommend it to anyone.\nThe first and most noticable error the game has is constant spelling and grammar errors. This isn't even a minor issue, as in some occasions it was actually rather difficult to decipher what my options actually were. This made sections that could've been simple much harder to interpret in the long run. This is made even more apparent by how short the game actually is. This game has a runtime of anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour.\nThe story of this game is also a dissapointment. The game builds up at the beginning at a decent pace. It was interesting and actually worth more than the asking price at first. The story just sort of stagnates at around 10-20 minutes in. The story tapers off into witchcraft for some reason, and never really explains the other world your find yourself in throughout. In a game that's entirely story driven, that is unacceptable.\nFor these reasons I really feel the game isn't worth it, even if it's less than a dollar. The game can be beaten in less than an hour, so if you rush you can beat the game and still have time to refund it like I did, OR, you can save yourself the trouble and buy something else.","August 17, 2015","false","1.1"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

It is near impossible to grow to like any character, Faust included, in 45 minutes (the amount of time it took me to beat my first playthrough) which makes it even harder to recommend this narrative-driven game, especially since I feel like every character is a by-the-numbers archetype. It also sets up some ideas plot wise that never actually come to fruition. Some can call that "Leaving it up to the reader/player's imagination," I call it "lazy storytelling."\n\nThe whole idea of selling parts of your soul for certain choices seems pretty pointless. I'm sure some choices might have put me on a different path, but I really didn't care enough after playing through the first time to see where a new set of choices would land me, especially since I'm willing to bet it all ends in the same place at the end of the day. Also, some rather important choices on whether or not I trust certain characters seem to be completely out of my control.\n\nI will say that this game has a great soundtrack and good art style. Those are the only positives I have for this game. I got this game for 40 cents and I still do not think this game is worth the money.","June 19, 2015","false","0.9"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

The work comes off as amateur-ish when there's glitches and typos in the game. It isn't even a long game. It would be easy to test stuff out quickly before releasing the game on Steam.\n\nOtherwise, I didn't hate the game. It has lots of branching paths, although, they were sort of easy to figure out.

Still, I don't recommend this game because of one thing: the story.\n\nToo short of a storyThe game is too short for a story-driven game. 3 chapters with a prelude, but fast to complete. You'll need less than an hour to finish it the first time...\n\nLow consequences... and when you discover on your second playthrough that your choices have little to no consequences on the story, either you will stop the game because you consider it's worth the time, or you'll rush as many playthrough as you can to grab all the achievements.\n\nMissed opportunity for a great gameThe game had everything in gameplay & world, but because of a short story and choices with low to no consequences, the characteristics system becomes useless as for the soul gambling. The two of them simply alter a little what information you get in your playthrough and some storytelling, but not the endings that are too close of each others and too bland. The ramifications in the story are too short, making the game deliver you one and single story. No alternative path or things like that since every actions in a certain time of the story will ends the same way.\n\nI played the demo first before buying the game. I finished the demo many times because I liked the concept delivered, but the game haven't given me enough. The demo is simply 1/3 (if not half) of the full game, and was good enough. The game simply doesn't offer multiple destiny for the character, even if the world is made like this doesn't mean the character's can't have choices with bigger consequences.","February 16, 2015","false","3.8"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

I played it on my mobile phone while it still was a free demo, and as I see it ahead of me as a full game (as it calls itself) I am slightly disapointed.\n\nI mastered all it's in game achievments, but after that, nothing. Not even the quest on getting every single dialogue I challenged myself to made me want to replay it. I have seen every possible outcome on the game. although it was really good. I feel like it could have been MUCH longer than just 3 chapters. If it were 8 chapters with diverse dialogues and perhaps a longer run time on the plot itself, I would call it worth it. Now I only consider myself a disapointed fan. especially considering I got the special edition with it's "huge" soundtrack of it's 4 songs and it's artbook (which wasn't too shabby but doesn't compensate the extra money I spent on it).\n\nI loved the story and the concept itself, but the execution was too poor to be priced like this.","October 14, 2014","false","7.6"," 2 of 14 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","2","14","0","0"

I got it in a cheap bundle, so for me it was just about worth it.. I wouldn't want to pay more than £2 on it.\n\nI'd say the worst thing it has going for it, for me, is that i had to install internet explorer 10 to get the game to even play.\nAs for the game itself.. i quite like the idea of it, but it just didn't end up as fun as i'd hoped it would be. It's fairly short, which i was thankful for as it didnt really offer much to keep me interested for too long.\n\nSome of the english goes abit... foreign-like at times, which is a slight annoyance. One other thing that bothered me was how the protagonist sounded so sleazy when saying 'bye' to a woman at a bar, pretty much forcing her to kiss him or he would stalk her or something.. ugh.\n\nAll of the bad things are slightly redeemed by the little monkey island referance in the game though.\n\nanyway, it's an alright game if you like 'choose your own adventure' type books.","July 20, 2014","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The characters aren't too connectable, the "gameplay" isn't too great and the game is a bit too slow for what the gameplay offers. If you're an achievement hunter, I recommend this game.

Here your decisions will bite you back in next chapters. You also get different options depending on your stats and soul. Stats can be changed, if you're ready to pay the price.\n\nNice comic graphics, simple but interesting storyline. Did I mention it branches depending on your choices? The comic format keeps the story nicely pacing, while classical VN format would drown you in description and inner monologues.\n\nOn the other hand, the soundtrack is nothing special. Speaking of sound, turning it off in options mutes the BGM, but not the sound effects. Barely noticable, there are about five of them.\n\nOh boy, and the choices...\n\nWhat, am I repeating myself?

I enjoyed playing the Choose-your-own-adventure style "game" if you may. The storyline was fun to play along with and I found myself relating to the main character actually way too mcuh for the first chapter or 2. I'm not going to say it's complex but if you pay attention to the details it makes things go much smoother. It was a little on the short side, think it took me 1.5 hours from start to finish but there are so many other paths to choose in this game that I'll go back and see if that makes  a difference.

I spent like 20-30 minutes and get the story to the end. Saying that I was disappointed is like saying nothing. Really, I walk my dog (in both meanings) longer than completing "Soul Gambler". It should be longer, a little at least.\n\nSecond: you cannot skip dialogues. So if you want to have 100% achievements - once again, rethink, because you'll end with 3 hours of clicking. And while clicking isn't that bad in clicker games... well, other visual novels rather have that option - guess why? So the player won't get stuck with the lines he read already few times.\n\nThird: the story is lame. Seriously. I'm a big fan of Faustian myth - starting from the short stories from 15 century to Goethe's masterpiece and then to contemporary literature and movies that cover many interpretations of the same story of Faust. And to be clear: I don't expect the game (that cheap at least) to have complex, wonderful plot just like writers decades ago. But I expect it to have at least decent story, decent writing and characters that will have my heart. In the end, it's a visual novel and that genre is ALL ABOUT STORY. And this one is... bland. It just takes few trite motives connected to word "devil", mix it without understanding and voila! You have a pact, some of 666 here and there, ridiculous rituals and bam! you're done with the story, leave it idle for cards.\n\nFourth:  the ending. Except being lame and devil-may-care, it's basically always the same. Minor things changes depending on your choices, but you will always see the same scenes, the same dialogues, nothing will surprise you. So, if you're looking for the game where you can create a story from beginning till the end and where CHOICES MATTER, sorry, but it's not the game you're looking for.\n\nTo be honest, I really wanted to like this game. I appreciated the artwork, especially of the "dark reality", but for me pretty pictures aren't satisfying enough.","February 3","false","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
