Has a fast pace, a career type mode where have to purchase upgrades. Not a absurdly long game by todays standards, but quite a solid title and a must play if you purchased the Anthology. Solid 256-color VGA graphics, digitized sounds (!), and a host of little touches make this game a joy to play and add depth.\n\nOnly downside, is this has no interaction with Steam or modernization at all which is a shame because achievements would have been an awesome modern touch.\n\nIt kicks me square in my childhood, speaking of which... My brother and I were so excited when we got this game back then, that we fought it out over who played first. My front tooth lost, and the parents were not all too amused.\n\nAhh, the memories.","May 6, 2015","true","1.1"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","23","27","5","4"

Thousands of planes, helicopters, tanks, boats, and stationary guns, and nothing standing between them and you except an arsenal of ridiculous weapons and your own twitch skill. Elite mode is basically suicide, and your keyboard will not survive. It's played with arrow keys + ctrl-alt-space, which is a little clunky but you get used to it.\n\nRaptor survives the test of time, released more than 20 years ago, and the polish that Apogee put into it really shows. The pixellated graphics are skilfully-rendered and it's very clear what's happening, which is definitely a good thing since the game is basically a bullet hell. Skillfully using the situational weapons you buy and find is critical to keeping down the flood of enemies so that you aren't overwhelmed. Every enemy and building destroyed yields money at the end of the mission that can be used to fix up your top-of-the-line fighter with shields, radar, conventional missiles, auto-tracking miniguns, experimental EMP waves, and eventually my favorite weapon, the laser that fires twin beams of azure fire.\n\nThe levels initially follow a simple progression: Fight off a few enemies, pick up a weapon, use it to maul your way past the rest of the level while trying to avoid damage and make your end-of-level repair bill as low as you can. Eventually you'll fight a boss (Known to the devs as a "Battle Cow," strangely), which is usually an immense airship bristling with weapons. If things get too hectic, there's a pricey but room-clearing Megabomb just a tap of the spacebar away. It destroys everything onscreen (Dealing heavy damage to bosses) but takes a few seconds to go off (As it floats to the middle of the screen) adding a bit of strategic depth on timing and being able to expect yourself to get shitcanned a few seconds before it actually happens. A bit later in the game, some of the original bosses make appearances as mini-bosses which always calls for a hectic all-out DPS-dump. Take too long and you'll be fighting off the mini-boss at the same time as the level's standard enemies. Later, the bosses will manifest as humungous, multi-turreted ground-based fortresses, which have immense health bars and require a good amount of timing to cut down.\n\nA lot of the weapons are designed to be worthless in certain situations, picking the right one is always the key to survival. A couple of the weapons are total duds, but the small handful of "always active" weapons are always a safe bet. Save up for the auto-tracking minigun and prepare for a ♥♥♥♥ing good time because its DPS is huge and it shreds stuff to your sides, which most weapons can't do, quite useful if you've only got a pinprick of health left and a giant boss is obliteraing the airspace directly in front of it.\n\nIt's not nostalgia, it's just damn good: Raptor is tough as nails and the harder difficulties will probably beat your ♥♥♥. Do yourself a favor and pick this up.","May 7, 2015","true","4.6"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","12","17","2","0"

If you make this mistake, as I did, the screen will rotate on you and ruin your game.

No window-sizing issues, no compatibility problems, not even the slightest  hint of input lag (I'm looking at you, Age of Empires II) - I've read of some people having a harder time with the 2015 Edition, but from my experience, the Classic Edition is flawless from a functionality standpoint.\n\nAs for the game itself - well, video games have come a long way in 22 years, and you won't find a much better barometer for exactly how far than Raptor. The levels are ugly - they can get incredibily cluttered to the point where it's hard to tell what is even happening, the colour palette gets very dark and murky in places, sometimes to the point where enemies are difficult to distinguish from the background scenery, and both of these things combined with some pretty poor colour contrast means that the inclusion of the occasional night time mission was a very, very bad idea.\n\nThe upgrade system is fairly extensive, but ultimately pointless. You can afford arguably the best gun in the game (which costs less than two-tenths of the most expensive gun available), the Auto-Track Mini-Gun, before the end of the first sector, which is to the games difficulty curve what Ivan Milat was to European backpackers.\n\nBut ultimately, nitpicking a 20 year old game aside, if you enjoyed the game way back when and are the nostalgic type, there is enough here to recommend, especially for 5 bucks.\n\nThis is how Steam ports of old games should be done.","April 7","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Actually Raptor is only game in shooter\ncategory I remember on PC, so it has it's own special worth too.\n\nStages are all up-scrolling while shoot and blast endless wave of enemy fighters,\nships, tanks, buildings. I tell you this, it's actually quite repetitive.\nBut it gives you more than enough stimulate to keep playing, and game is spiced up with\nit's upgrading feature, where you can buy equipment and upgrade your fighter between\nany stages with your money which hard-earned by destroying things.\n\nGraphics are cool and well detailed despite of it's old-ages. I'm sure it'll please your eyes.\n\nAnd Sound, it's something I can't say it's really good.

But man, today, it plays like aaass.\n\nThe ship movement feels really floaty. It accelerates fast, and it keeps moving a bit more when you let go of the movement key. So you can either do large but imprecise sweeping movements, or small twitchy movements, which are not helpful.\n\nThe screen area is too small for the kinds of jittery moves the enemies do - there's little room to dodge, so you'll take damage no matter what once the tanks with homing shots start coming in.\n\nThe player's collision box does not match the shape of the plane, and is about 50% larger - very misleading to someone used to playing bullet hell shooters. The fact that your hitbox is so big means that any sort of fine maneuvering, like squeezing between streams of bullets, is just not worth it.\n\nThe ship health is directly tied to player money. The worse you do, the more you'll have to spend to refill your health, and the less you'll have to buy weapons. The stages get more and more unforgiving, and there's no way to go back and farm up some extra money. So if you don't perform really well, might as well just reload and try again.\n\nAnd as a final F* you: if you take too much damage, you lose all your weapons.
