(i'm assuming the game is made in a game maker tool). if you sift tab into the steam overlay it will get stuck there so youll need to restart the game (developer said it was fixed in 1.03 Build). when you do a playthrough and chose a specific path you can just get stuck in a infinite loop.\nin the opening scene of the game it says it has a simple combat system… there's no combat system you will get the option to do one thing or the other.\nin the trailer it shows some sort of animation in the game yet again there is non.\nthe images on the store page is literally what the game is.","September 4, 2015","false","0.4"," 74 of 90 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","74","90","7","7"

Wild Island Quest follows the story of a group of guys who are going from their home island (Mech-City Island) to Wild Island while it's on a rare pass-by. While you can go it alone, you can also gather up your friends to go with you. What choices you make determine how many of your friends you can recruit (I did the path with recruiting Conan only).\n\nInteresting idea, right? That's what got me initially interested. Unfortunately, everything goes wrong in Wild Island Quest quite fast. If you're able to even follow the story, you'll find a a lot of English mistakes in terms of grammar and odd word choices. This pretty much tells you that this was translated with a Russian to English dictionary and in quite a few places it seemed they didn't quite know which word to use so they just picked a random one. Of course, this "random one" makes very little sense to a native English speaker, and in several cases I actually had to go search up words that were used to try and figure out what word/meaning they were going for.\n\nThe horrendous English coupled with the pretty poor graphics (the models just look awful) make Wild Island Quest fall very short of what it could have been. As it stands, unless some drastic improvements are made, this game gets a gigantic pass. There are better visual novels/choose your own adventures out there. Oh and no, there isn't really a "combat system". You just choose if you were lucky or unlucky in an outcome.","September 7, 2015","false","1.6"," 41 of 52 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","41","52","3","0"

The achievements are exceptionally easy, which should just take under an hour to complete. The story itself isn't particularly memorable, but has an intresting concept. Despite this the price isn't worth it, not even for the achievements or card drops. Playing the game will give you 3/5 card drops.\n\nReview:\n"You're approaching the edge of the island as the "Wild Island" floats closer, now only a jump away. Your friends beckon you to come over, before the opportunity is stolen from you. Taking a deep breath, you jump -"\nSuddenly you wake up, and here is where the novel starts. Today is finally the day you will be able to see explore the Wild Island, a dream you've had for years now. But first, you must prepare yourself. This is where the first options are given to you, who and what you take etc. After playing through the game three times, it doesn't really matter who you take with you, as the ending is usually the same: You either complete your objective or die in the process. The novel however does have checkpoints, so if you die you won't have to begin again from the start. The most important thing that matters is your  Luck, which is rolled with a dice at the very begining off the game. Fortunately you can re-roll if you're not satisfied with the score. This determines if the choice you chose will succeed or fail, for example lighting a fire or combat.\n\nSomething you'll notice right off the bat is a lot of translation errors, as the story was orginally in russian. However this doesn't take away from the overall feeling of the game. Graphically it looks decent, although there was some scenes where a stock photo was used as the background, which does take away from the immersion of the game. The audio is quite pleasing, and can be relaxing at times when accompanied by naturistic sounds.\n\nOverall this game could have been a great VN, if more effort was put in to the overall story. Apart from this everything is practically fine, but if you're looking for a VN with beautiful graphics/art and great audio, this VN isn't for you.\n\nIf you like my review, any feedback is appreciated and if you would like to see more reviews from me in the future, feel free to follow me!","May 9","false","4.6"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","30","36","2","0"

You can complete this game rather quickly and 100% the game in an hour or two. The graphics have a wide range of polish; the city was really well done... the "Wild Island" floating looked like garbage. Odd photos added into the game to pay tribute to its Russian Comrade creators.\n\nOnce in a generation the wild floating island orbits close to the mainland. While witnessing this majestic your poor pup jumps the distance and vanishes into the woods of Wild Island. You have no choice but to follow and retrieve your dog at any cost...\n\nWorth $0.50-2. I'd only grab on HEAVY discount. If you are new to Visual Novels please don't play this first.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

I do recognize, however, their effort to do something different.

As it is, now, it may be a fun litle ride, but not something worth any money, so I have to give it a thumbs down.\n\nNote: I played this game a couple of times to see different paths/endings, but most of my time in the game (more than 3 hours) was iddling it for cards","April 17","false","3.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

It reminds me of VRML technology good-old times - crude modelling, plain textures. The music is simple and repetitive as well. The piece of children's literature tells us about a group of teenagers who went on a trip from their urban floating island to a mysterious wild nature floating island with the goal of having trouble, you have to make their few choices in written dialogues. Shall our heroes overcome all the hardships and triumph over the wildlings?

Taking with a discount is recomended.\nPS genre is "choose your own adventure" rather than visual novel as written by some users.\n\nЭта игра могла бы быть лучше, но дальше, видимо, развиваться не будет.\nПлюсы: действия игрока на самом деле влияют на сюжет, последствия выбора логичны и понятны, неплохой сюжет.\nМинусы: интерфейс сделан небрежно, сюжет без интриги и "неожиданных поворотов", пройти всеми способами можно за час.\nВ целом неплохая, где-то из 90х, игра на вечер.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fawns/recommended/392820/","Fawns","Officer Nick Wilde","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fawns/","605 products in account","Listen. A lot of my reviews are normally tongue-in-cheek or weird offbeat satire about what I really think about the game, DLC, or other applicable categories for products on the Steam content distribution program. This is a vastly different situation. No other game on Steam has given me ringworm before. This gave me ringworm. I cannot stress this enough: This particular game called Wild Island Quest has somehow been enough of a blight on my computer that it produced physical ringworms and dispensed them into my body. I also feel as if a large portion of my blood has either dissipated into the atmosphere via my pores or has otherwise been stolen from me in a sudden and rather horrifying manner by this downloadable content. I fear that I may not have enough time to write my final will and testament, so I am pleading with you all to inform my family that when they find my dessicated husk of a body coated in plague flies, gripping my keyboard and mouse in rigor mortis, that I love them very much and did not wish for my death to come in this manner.","November 6, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","25","2","8","4","0"
