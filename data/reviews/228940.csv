I like racing games, and I seem to recall maybe being vaguely excited for Carnage Racing years ago when I saw it on Gametrailers? I wasn't sure.\n\nBut outside of the Free Weekend it was on sale for $2.50, so rather than wait like a sensible human being, I bought it sight unseen.\n\nAnd, boy, I learned a lesson today.\n\nThe game itself feels like it fell off of the iPhone in the worst way possible. The music is super uninspired, the sounds are limp and wimpy, the art is kind of questionable (what is up with that dude's proportions?), the cars are sluggish, and the weapons don't feel good (not only that, but you are totally, 100% defenseless in first place).\n\nOn top of that, the game informs you that you can use any USB gamepad to play the game, but does not offer any control customization options. I tried my Dualshock controller first (as I find it to be the most comfortable) but the only button that would respond was R2 - which Carnage Racing interpreted as the pause button. To get it to recognize my wired 360 controller, I had to quit out of the game and relaunch it, too. Kind of a nitpick, but still silly.\n\nThe game similarly doesn't provide any graphics customization options, with a single slider for "Quality" that goes between High, Normal, Low and Lowest. I did not notice any immediate change to the game's performance switching between these options, and driving retained sort of a jittery feeling throughout.\n\nCarnage Racing's primary conceit is a teleportation meter that fills up, and once you pop it, you can drive through portals that warp you to an alternate path. It's kind of a cute idea but isn't utilized very well (your meter fills up so slowly that you can only use the warp once per lap, and almost always in the same spot). On top of that, warping is a little disorienting - you don't teleport in "logical space". It's literally a portal to some unrelated section of the track. It makes it hard to keep a bead on where your opponents are because even if somebody's on your left, when you warp, you could suddenly be on the opposite side of the track, above them. There's absolutely a feeling of "Okay, where even am I in relation to anything, now?" There's no immediately recognizable benefit to using it, it just looks cool.\n\nBut I could probably put up with that. I've played lackluster racing games before and gotten some amount of enjoyment from them. The real problem with Carnage Racing is that it kind of doesn't want me to play it at all.\n\nAfter a certain point, tracks just... stop loading. Me and all the CPU racers will spawn in the sky and fall for an eternity. Sometimes, dumping out to the menu and re-loading back in to a race will fix it, but most of the time, it doesn't. It makes it 100% unplayable in any degree whatsoever.\n\nOn the plus side, I'm only out $2.50, and bizarrely one of the Steam trading cards I got from the game is selling for an average of $0.84, so I may yet even make my money back.\n\nIf only I could actually play it, maybe it wouldn't be such a steaming pile.","July 25, 2014","false","1.5"," 207 of 253 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","207","253","5","7"

I have no idea why this game was released on a PC. It will be probably an acceptable game to entertain yourself while waiting for something, but PC definitely has much more interesting games to play.\n\nThe game is made badly and has a lot of bugs and imperfections, many players experiencing them, what you can see on a screenshots. It starts from wrong pop-up messages on buttons and inability to change sound volume and ends with rendering bugs and unstable multiplayer.\n\nPlaying a career is not so fun, bots are quite stupid, but playing a multiplayer is much more entertaining. However, sometimes I was winning a lot of games in a row with almost no competition. Background music is represented by the single annoying looped track.\n\nThe game definitely doesn't worth its current price. Its real cost is 2.5 times less.\n\n\nThis game is based on ideas of two great games of late 90's - early 00's — Re-Volt[en.wikipedia.org] and Stunt GP — with a little changes and additions.\nPlaying Re-Volt always was and still much more entertaining and competitive for me, even with bots in career. Even after 15 years from release this game is still alive!!!\n\nSo, what Re-Volt can offer to you:\nthe game is officially abandoned, and can be downloaded and played for free;\nthe game has a build-in track editor;\nthe game has a lot of beautiful user-made tracks and cars;\nthe community is still releasing updates (occasionally);\nmany people are playing online every day and online championships are held every month;\nnew user-made tracks and cars are released every so often...With all of this you will never be bored!!\n\nIf you became interested in playing Re-Volt, then there are some things for you to know:\nCurrent game versions used by the community[z3.invisionfree.com];\nRVR — online racing community[revoltrace.net]. Information about how to play online, current and upcoming championships;\nRVZ — storage of all the tracks and cars[revoltzone.net];\nMost loved user-made tracks[www.kajeuter.com].I hope after all of the above you will prefer to play Re-Volt rather than this game.

Well it has a little lack in sense of speed but if you are more about shooting your oponents or doing stunts this is totaly for you! Also later in the game you unlock the "Speedstar" class which gives you a sense of speed! There is no drifting or nitro, its only you, you car, and your weapons. There is a huge upgrade system for every car and it actually will take you a little while to get your first car fully upgraded, but as soon as you got your first car on its best, you will feel the need to play with friends and make them angry becausey in my case, I rapitly fire stuff at them ^^ Its worth the price and you will have fun with it. Only bad thing is, that the maps are not realy creative. there are just 7 or 8 maps and the othere 14 or somewhat about that are just a mix of the 7 or 8.

This game went on sale for dirt cheap during the 2013 holiday sale. I purchased the 4 player pack and gave them out to some friends as gifts. I knew it featured 8 player Multiplayer so I figured, its a racing game, 8 player MP and cheap. how bad can it be?\n\nCarnage Racing is not what I expected, it was more, way more. It has physics that are completely un realistic and un natural, the pace is slow and dragging, the stunts suck and the points you get really don’t matter. But after the end of each race I'm laughing, competitive, happy and craving the next race!\n\nThere is something about a game that plays simple, is low key and just does the bare minimum. Micro transactions are gone, pay to win is gone and you get the full game with your initial purchase. The game play is fun and easy to pick up and play no matter your skill level. "Phase Shifting" allows you to warp ahead of other players here and there, and the selection of weapons is limited to 4-5 types, so its not confusing. At the end of the race, you may be a good driver but if you know how to use weapons correctly, you can smack that 1st place outta there!\n\nI love Carnage Racing, its probably some of the best laughs I've had with my homies playing online, please get it and let me know so you can join us!","March 5, 2014","true","20.3"," 69 of 128 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","69","128","0","4"

This is that, but in your house, with better music, with multiplayer mode, more cars, more achievements, and more fun. I've had it for two days, and I've already played it for 10 hours.\n\nCarnage Racing is unpredictable and fun. That's the bottom line. You can pick up weapons throughout the race course, and you never know whether somebody will slow you down, bomb you, portal up next to you... Or maybe you'll do the same to them. It truly is carnage. I also appreciate the pun in the title, which is a pretty big plus. As expected from Jagex, always slipping little jokes into their games.\n\nThere are a few downsides, of course. The campaign is pretty easy. There aren't any instances when you're on a hairpin's breadth, trying to beat an AI. It only took me about five hours to get all the achievements and fully upgrade a few cars (with some EPIC paint jobs, I might add.) The AIs are a bit stupid, often crashing into you at the start, but after that things straighten out and get fun. The maps are a bit blurry. I'm often lagging when I enter a new game zone. 'Game zones' - the entire game is made up of maybe seven different map sections, lasting thirty seconds or so each. Each map is a little boring, because it's just a new combination of a zone or two. That's about it, though. I've read about other people having glitches, but I haven't, so I don't care.\n\nLooking past some of the downsides, once again, this game is fun. The cars handle well, the weapons are pretty epic, and what it loses in refined content, it makes up for in raw imagination. As someone who's played a lot of Jagex sidescrollers and other games - Arcanists, Armies of Gieleinor, Runescape, you name it - this fits among the rest of them quite well. It's up to you whether you like that or not. I do!\n\nThanks, Jagex!","July 27, 2014","true","10.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It was really cheap, yes, but not worth it. I would like to start this review by saying this was not only an mobile game once, but also a facebook game. Yeah, you heard it right. Even the developers know this was a bad idea.\nThe game started fun, i played some time with my friends and we were having fun, the problem was, that the game is completely unbalanced. Think of Mario Kart, now focus on the unfair things, like the freakin Blue Shell, now think that if you play more than everybody you will have an oportunity to upgrade the blue shell in a way that it multiplies and hits every other player. Now forget all of that, because this game is even more unfair. You have an item that simply teleports you to the nearest player in front of you no matter how far you are, and you can upgrade it after grinding some money in the game. When you do upgrade this teleport to the maximum (like i did), you can teleport to 3 players ahead of you. So if you are playing it with 2-3 friends (like me), you will always appear right next to the first place. This game do not reward your skills, it rewards your luck. Also, if you play more than your friends, you can upgrade all your items to the max and make the game impossible for the ones who have less time or are busy playing actual well-made games.\nBut that is not the worst part, when playing multiplayer (even though the game was repetitive as hell and had a lack of maps) i actually had some kind of fun. What really made me come here to write this negative review was the singleplayer.\nAfter my friends left the game i decided to play the campaing alone so i could unlock the other cars (no, you can't freakin unlock them multiplayer). The AI wasn't a big deal, the challengs were not that hard. The problem is that when i got through a part of the game, completed all challenges in all the missions i played, and when i was trying to restart a race the game crashed. Ok, normal. I opened it again and... my save was gone! Simple as that, all the upgrades i had, all my stars, everything was gone.\nMaybe you are thinking i only wrote this review because i was angry, but the game is actually really unbalanced and repetitive. Also, i have all my reasons to be angry, i lost my frekin save.\n\nPros:\n+Kind of fun multiplayer.\n+Ok graphics.\n+Good sensation when exploding someone.\n\nCons:\n-Repetitive.\n-Unbalanced.\n-Rewarding the wrong players.\n-Unsafe save file.\n-SinglePlayer sucks.\n-Steam port of a Mobile-Facebook game.\n\nConclusion\nDon't buy this game, if you want a arena racing game to play with friends, go buy Post Apocalyptic Mayhem or Zero Gear.","August 4, 2014","false","2.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

SInce the biggest appeal to the game is multiplayer, there is very little replay value once you have completed the courses.\n\nGranted quite a lot of maps, but most look somewhat similar to each other and provide very little in the form of variety. The game and racing mechanics and strategy needed to win here by juggling weapon usage and upgrades, portal jumping and skilled driving is quite good. But Ai in itself is relatively easy to beat and so again without multiplayer there really is no need to buy.\n\nDevelopers rarely ever offer customer support, and it seems to be an abandoned game, promising no new content in the way of maps, cars or any other dlc.\n\nI was a big fan of Jag Ex only to find that their delivering of development promises ran out of petrol way too quick. In a nutshell the way this game has been left decomposing and there will soon be nothing left of it other than a fossil fuel. Having said that its funny as hell when you see some one about to enter a portal gate and so you zap them of their energy and instead see them drive straight into a brickwall at high speeds. Oh the memories and the fun times you have given me. RIP Carnage Racing. I've said my prayers and lay a boquet of oil sludge on your tombstone.\n\nPS achievement hunters beware there are a lot of achievements which are multiplayer which are no longer possible meaning 100% pass rate is now impossible. Also there is an achievement where you have to log in for 20 days straight you know how hard that is!!! Took me 3 years too accomplish.","December 27, 2013","false","40.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

If you are using a controller then you need to let go and use the mouse to exit the popups, afterwards it goes right back to the game and you lose speed because your hand was on the mouse not the gas.\nOne of the biggest issues it seems is small time (and sadly some big time) devs don't include enough options to set. One such option I would like to turn of is the motion blur applied to the scenery as you drive by. It looks stupid and seems to cause the appearance of micro stutter.\n\nThe devs also seem to have gotten lazy on optimizing the core mechanics. Steering feels awkward, the warp portal things don't seem to work all the time and sometimes attacking through the big warpgate does nothing.\n\nThis game isn't worth the sale price of $2.50 USD let alone the normal price of $10.00 USD. Don't waste your money on it.\n\n\nMessage to the devs, if you want to port/make a game for PC make sure you revamp the UI and add audio/video/general options in detail and add UI navigation for mouse, keyboard and controller. If you patch in the fixes and add in the PC specific bits this could be a decent $5.00 USD game.\n\n\n","July 26, 2014","false","0.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The warping is a nice mechanic, but the portals are barely bigger than your car, so its really easy to get pushed sideways into halfway hitting the solid wall next to it. Since the portals are only open for a few seconds, by the time the car manages to get all 4 tires back on the ground, its gone and you are now in last place when you were in first place.\n\nIn short, this is very similar to the Facebook version of the game. It has a more advanced (meaing buggier) physics engine, prettier textures, a less cash-flow-oriented upgrade tree, and is an overall ho-hum combat racing game.

It is a multiplayer focused kart racing game featuring lots of weapons, big jumps, stunts and a unique mechanic in racing games – portals. Yes this is probably the only racing game where you can warp around the track. These can be used to take shortcuts and reach places other drivers cannot.\n\nThere is a short single player championship against somewhat dodgy AI cars and each race has a set number of challenges to complete. These range from simply finishing in first place, performing jumps, blasting a set number of cars etc. Unfortunately the intelligence of the other drivers is...well...they are stupid! Carnage Racing has the sort of drivers that are single minded and will just do whatever they want and ignore you, usually just trying to drive straight through your vehicle.\n\nControls aren't that great either. When playing with a controller the left stick is used for both steering and those stunts which sounds OK, but just doesn't work in practice. For example a double press left or right causes you car to flip over, but sometimes you need to straighten up for a landing (you can steer in mid air) and when you try to do this you flip over without meaning to as if there's some invisible gremlin taking control. The stunt controls are also quite unresponsive so even if you really want to flip or spin you don't and end up just hitting left or right waiting for it to do something.\n\nHaving said that when it all comes together the game can be great fun. The problem is that these moments are too few and far between. Add to this a number of bugs and glitches and many faults in the game design and what you get is an annoying, frustrating, unfair mess of a game.\n\nThe single player is very easy though which goes some way to make up for the problems. In fact the challenge does not come from the actual racing, but from trying to complete those challenges. Some of which are easier to get once you upgrade your vehicles or buy a new one.\n\nTaking the game online does make things better. Human opponents play much better the the computer and when you have a full roster you can see what the developers were trying to achieve. Having said that there are too few cars and tracks meaning that you will see everything the game has to offer in a short space of time.\n\nIf you can live with it's problems and have a few friends who like to play then there is a semi-decent game buried here, if not then you are probably better of spending your hard earned elsewhere.","June 27, 2014","false","55.3"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

I liked the initial idea of a racing/combat game with a more cartoonish feel rather than a destruction derby or demolition type feel. After playing the game for a while and getting the hang of a few things, it was really fun to play. One thing that really seemed missing, though, was an intro control tutorial. It took me a few minutes and a few awkward crashes to realize what keys did what, as I jumped right into the game without realizing that it wouldn't let me know the advanced controls (weapons/phase shifts) in-game. The AI are really competitive and it makes for a good challenge as you work your way through the game.\n\nThe real strong point for this game is the fact that only a few maps can be turned into so many different courses through the use of the "phase shift" portals that are placed around the track. These help you gain ground and can help anyone who knows which ones to take to go from a lap down to competing for the front in just a few seconds. I love being able to elude people and switch up my position on the track, as well as avoid weapons and take the lead in a few fun portal jumps. Anyone who likes taking their enemies by surprise or taking a unique look at the world of racing while enjoy the fun and smooth action in Carnage Racing.\n\nThat being said, there are a few things I would love to see changed:\n-smoother interaction with the roll/flip/spin mechanics and movement controls\n-a slight drift/tire spin mechanic which could be used to help players overcome certain areas of the track\n-fixes to track "potholes" where cars can suddenly hit walls that aren't there and come to a complete stop\n\nThis game will provide hours of entertainment. If you can get the right group together online, there are many fun and spectacular battles to be had. I fully recommend this game to anyone who enjoys simple and fun battle racing.","January 31, 2014","true","12.8"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","14","28","0","0"

I don't generally like racing games as they are simply bording and no fun. CR may have questionable cartoon like graphics, but its a old game, I actually prefer cartoon graphics over real world graphics.  Problem with most racing games is while the graphics are good, it bores the hell out of me as its like driving home from work half the time.\n\nThis game does have some odd bugs but generally they are few and far between.  I only play on the keyboard, it has very limited options but for me its not a problem anyway.\n\nThe game starts slow when you first install it, but this is good as you can get used to the tracks and gameplay. As you win more races and do the challanges you can buy faster engines and update your car. You can do stunts, go flying over ledges and ramps, blow other cars up with a range of weapons, definatly a good old fun game to play.  If you are a fan of F1 type games then you will probably hate CR.  If you want something which is fun to play without huge headaches of learning lots of keys, then CR is definatly worth a try.\n\nI wish the developers would update the game.  oh, and you also need some friends to play as the online gameplay seems to have long since gone.   You can play on your own vs PC cars, which you have to do anyway when you first start playing.\n\n","October 26, 2015","true","164.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","2"

Sadly, I cannot recommend spending more than perhaps 2 or 3 Euro for it. I spent 5 and do somewhat regret it. Nice as it is.\n\n\n[h2]More detail:[/h2]\n\nThe music is OK, but nothing grand - I feel the game could profit immensely if they'd licensed fitting music. As it is, the in-game music is rather repetitive and makes it feel even more like a well-made flash game. (I'm thinking of Nail'D as comparison - without the music that would be only half as good.)\n\nControls are somewhat weird, IMO. It took a while for me to get used to them.\n\nThe tutorial could explain some things better - took me a while to realize what those "collect 2 weapon hit" goals were. (Higher upgrades allow up to three charges - hence the collect 2).\nI'm still not sure how to complete some of the stunt goals - likely I need a different car for that.\n\nSome weapon upgrades allow for interesting gameplay - you can "drop" weapons, making traps out of them. Quite useful to get rid of the rest of the gang when you're the first and want to keep it that way.\nAlso, definitely get the phase shift upgrade first - being able to store 2 shifts instead of just 1 is very helpful - a shift can cut away quite a part of the track, or help get rid of an annoying bomb someone attached to your car.\n\nThe tracks are sometimes rather confusing - due to the phase shifting there are often multiple ways to get across them, and you don't get a complete map of them, so you'll have to memorize the best routes.","January 5, 2014","true","35.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

In that, it seems to belong to a different era of gaming. The price is obviously exaggerated. This game should be at most 1 euro for a single copy of the game. And that's if there were a workshop, to at least allow the community to improve on the game. A very simplistic game, attempting to be some sort of Mario Kart. Simplistic cars, simplistic mechanics, simplistic graphics (and it still experiences fps drops on a i5 quad core, with a GT640, 2GB card), overall a very simple yet overpriced game.

Considering it's a racer, it' also quite slow and doesn't have great handling.\n\nIt is, however, pretty good fun. I'd recommend giving it a go for the online races and the time trial competitions.\n\nThe cars are split into three classes specialising in weapon strength, speed or tricks. In terms of singleplayer, each course has a number of goals you need to achieve such as bashing a number of opponents or performing a number of aerial moves. You level up aspects of your cars through winning races and fulfilling these criertia, along with competiing in online races.\n\n£6 is a reasonable price I would say, but those who are unsure might be best to wait for a sale.

The game has some VERY odd polygon fragmentation going on unless you lower your settings, but the game looks about the same regardless... if you like to get drunk, or high, & play slower moving kart type games, the few bucks spent on this (esp. if on sale) won't disapoint you... works great with an X360 pad too","June 27, 2014","true","3.1"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Carnage Racing is not a bad game, its actually rather fun, it is just so, so very forgettable. The visuals are stylized and cartoony, and the gameplay is extremely average, There is nothing that makes this game stand out. It almost feels like a mobile port from IOS or Android, Overall though I think you should play this game on the condition that you get it super cheap, or even free. Carnage Racing in my opinion is not worth more than 1 to 3 dollars if you are looking for a not very serious racing game.","July 25, 2014","true","6.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Loving a good racing game, especially racing with good wrecks and enjoying games throwing stuff at the other racers, I was looking forwards to this.\n\nWhile I did enjoy the single player races for awhile, there were several disappointments for me:\n\nThe items you use against the other racers will miss 95%+ of the time, due to having to aim AND race at the same time.\n\nThe items only force the car onto its to front wheels for a few seconds\n\nThe missile and time bomb are the best weapons. The rest are junk.\n\nGraphics look like they're from 2003 at best. They're that bad.\n\nWithin an hour and half-two hours, I'd unlocked 8 of the 21 tracks. They're fairly easy.\n\nThe tricks your supposed to do seem to never do them, even when falling from extra high dtstances. Not sure if I made a mistake or not though.\n\nThe colors always somehow came out not looking right. The orange looked like pink was mixed in. The red looked more like hot pink. The dark purple looked like pale purple.\n\nNever shows you how to buy to unlock the new cars.\n\nThe cars keep pixelating into different colors. That could be due to the fact that the warping changes colors.\n\nWarping continueally disrupts the race.\n\nDamage is black, oil looking splash's that last a few seconds.\n\nThe games best music is when the volume is muted.\n\nDespite this long list of complaints, I did get bout 90 minutes of enjoyment out of it. But then, the reason I give this a thumbs down is because the Multiplayer. Oh boy, the multiplayer. First off, they start you off in a race already in-progress. So you'll be in last place, while everyone else is on Lap 2 of 2 and heading for the finish. And why is everyone racing towards me? Seems that in Multiplayer races, somehow, someway, some racers will go one way, and the other racers will drive directly TOWARDS you, which ruins the race for you and makes it so confusing its unbelieveable. Oh and after the first race, assuming you continue, they just say go, so if your computer is slow, and your the 6th of 7 cars loaded, the 5 cars ahead of you could already be halfway done with the first lap! Its now not even a fair chance for online racing! I know missiles in a race aint always fair, but starting a race at the same time creates everyone with a 50-50. Oh and warping in online races seem to take you into multiple different races. I warped 4-5 times one race, and felt like a new race every time. New racers, and new track scenary. Course I went in-between these races 2-3 times each.\n\nOh and the cartoon characters(theres only 2) are so corny and yet kinda interesting slightly. But definitely corny.\n\nOverall, would not recommend unless Steam has it for .25 cents. Thats 1/4 of 1 dollar. Free weekend, I'd prob try it out again. Its not worth even 1 dollar. Free to play would be even better than that .25 cents.\n\n","July 27, 2014","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The driving feels slow and sluggish and the powerups are what the grame really foucuses on (which are cheap and overpowered). The race part is pretty much the same and poses no challenge to you because of all the different power ups and teleportation, which is by far the cheapest thing to put in a racing game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Simantic13/recommended/228940/","Simantic13","Simantic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Simantic13/","23 products in account","- I don't know what everyone else has been complaining about.  I think Carnage Racing is a really fun game!  If you want to compare it to Forza or Need for Speed, yeah, you'll probably be disappointed.  It's pretty clear that's NOT what this game is trying to be, though.  It's more of a big-boy's Mario Kart, with a nice combination of racing and weapons.  Imagine a racing version of Burnout (carnage-tastic racing, as opposed to reckless...wreckage).\n\n- The graphics are nice enough; pretty nice in general considering it's obviously not meant to be a simulation.  The background environment is very nice.  If you look, you can see the imperfections, but when you're trying to win a race, do a trick, and blow up the other racers before they blast you, trust me; you're not looking for imperfect tree shapes.  The cars are not the most gorgeous things, but they are game originals; not expensive licensed replicas; and for that, they're really not too bad looking.  There is some decent customization, which may be more appreciated with multiplayer play.  Again, though, the focus of this game is on the racing and carnage.  After a few races, you'll probably forget what your car looks like, anyway.\n\n- Grinding is right on par with what you'd expect, too.  In the beginning, it's easy to earn lots of cash and upgrade your car OR buy more cars (not both at once).  There are plenty of upgrades, and in line with the name of the game, probably 3 or 4 times as many upgrades for weapons than for car performance (bigger explosions always equals more fun!).  As you complete more goals, you unlock more tracks and earn more cash.  Every race earns money, though; not just winning or completing goals, so you're never stuck with no way to progress.  As with any grinder, it gets harder and requires more money as the game progresses, but it seems to be at a fair rate.  It's better than most of the grinding smart phone games that only let you play for a certain amount of time.  No waiting for a recharge or bugging your friends with requests; grind away till your heart's content!\n\n- The important part is that the physics are spot on (relatively speaking).  Again, it's not a simulation, so the physics aren't entirely realistic.  However, it is very smooth and consistent.  It's easy to get used to how the cars drive, and you can count on it to do what you expect 90% of the time.  You will get frustrated...probably often, but you'll soon realize that it's usually your own fault.  The game works well.  If you don't like how the car handles, try a different one; there are several to choose from in 3 different class types (power, speed, & tricks).  The AI racers are well set up, too.  There is a noticeable increase in difficulty, and there is always some challenge, but it’s not difficult to master your car and win with practice.\n\n- The only flaw I've found is an occasional crash bug.  I played for about 5 hours, and during that time the game outright crashed 4 or 5 times.  It was always the same way; at the end of a race, I clicked "Restart Race" to try again, and the screen froze solid.  It's intelligent enough to know, though.  When I Alt-Tabbed out of the game, a small pop-up was waiting to inform me that the game had crashed, and the developers would like me to email them the crash folder (though, they failed to include the email address in the message).  That's a nice touch, rather than simply leaving me wondering what happened.  The good news is that it never once crashed while I was doing anything; just in-between races, and the crashes never adversely affected anything.  I started the game right back up, and everything was just as I remembered.  I can cope with that.\n\n- Overall, I'd call Carnage Racing a game worth owning.  I hadn't looked at the cost of the game when I started playing, and I thought to myself, "I'd pay 5 or 10 bucks for this."  It's not going to be the game you'll tell all your friends about for its epic awesomeness.  However, it is a game you'll go back to play whenever you're looking for easy-access fun.  It reminds me of SSX Tricky on GameCube; there are better games out there, but that game was always fun to play; same here.  The regular price of $9.99 is perfectly fair for what the game is.  What it lacks in graphic detail, it easily makes up for in fun playability.  I don't know about you, but the most beautiful game in the world is no fun to me if it doesn't work right, and that’s not a worry with this game.  If you pay ten bucks for this game just for the fun of it, you won't be disappointed.  Get it for the sale price of $2.49, play it long enough to see how much fun it can be, and it'll make you think twice about what really makes some other games "worth" $60+.  Forza is better racing, no doubt, but this is full-screen fun for less than many hack-job smart phone apps.  How can you complain about that?\n\nQuality: 5 of 10\nPlayability: 9 of 10\nFun: 8 of 10\nValue: 11 of 10!","July 26, 2014","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't know about you, but the most beautiful game in the world is no fun to me if it doesn't work right, and that’s not a worry with this game.  If you pay ten bucks for this game just for the fun of it, you won't be disappointed.  Get it for the sale price of $2.49, play it long enough to see how much fun it can be, and it'll make you think twice about what really makes some other games "worth" $60+.  Forza is better racing, no doubt, but this is full-screen fun for less than many hack-job smart phone apps.  How can you complain about that?\n\nQuality: 5 of 10\nPlayability: 9 of 10\nFun: 8 of 10\nValue: 11 of 10!","July 26, 2014","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not the best racing game out there and it is not up to the standard of what modern games are expected to look or play like but that doesn't mean you should write it off. I played this game on a free weekend and then went ahead and bought it because I enjoyed it. It was fun, simple, and easy to get the hang of. I didn't have any problems syncing my 360 controller to the game but unfortunatly there is no menu support for the controller so you will need a mouse to navigate the options and such. The game has a nice soundtrack and ok visuals that compliment the games style quite well. Offline is a piece of cake and can be used to farm points for upgrades which will come in handy in the online mode which is a lot of fun. This reminds me of some of the racing games I grew up playing like Lego Racers 2 or Need for Speed though it really can't compare to their glory it is still a lot of fun. I believe everyone has their standards set way to high for games these days and some of us have forgotten what we had as kids and how great it was, we have been spoiled by high frame rates and dazzling visuals and cool features. We have forgotten to slow down and enjoy simple games that were not part of tripple A title line ups or ultra franchises owned by big ♥♥♥ companies.\n\nVERDICT: I recomend this to any and all who enjoyed simple racing tittles as kids.","July 26, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not amazing and you shouldn't expect it to be for under two dollars with the four pack (current sale price we got it for). However, it's worth the money. Play it with some friends and have a blast. Many laughs to be had. The people reviewing this saying the Microsoft 360 controller does not work are NOT correct. Or maybe it is THEIR controller that doesn't work correctly. I can confirm that my Xbox One controller works perfectly and I played with four friends who were all using Xbox 360 controllers (both wired and wireless). The only thing that doesn't work is you have to use a mouse to navigate through the menus. Can that be annoying? Sure. But we're already on the PC anyway. It's right there in front of you. It's really not that big of a deal.\n\nIf you have friends to play it with give it a try. To each is their own but I honestly enjoy it and I know the four I played with enjoyed themselves as well. 8 player multiplayer is nice if you play on a regular basis with larger groups. Normally we have to have a person sit out or rotate in since most co-op games are 2-4 players so having up to 8 online is a nice touch. I did notice we had a few issues hosting games. Not everyone had to option to choose a level to host when they went into multiplayer so we had to switch off. We did not try to open any ports however so I do not know if that would have fixed the issue for us. We had one race out of 20 something where two people disconnected but other than that everything went smoothly.\n\nPhasing is a neat addition and managing your meter or having it drained by an opponent right before going through a portal and slamming into a wall creates some hilarious moments. The trick system seems a bit hit or miss between choosing front/back flips or spins/rolls. Either way, there is fun to be had. I would not grab this at full price but for a couple dollars, go for it. I have also played the single player and enjoy it as well. I like the challenge system to earn stars to unlock more vehicles as it adds to the replay value. The levels are fun but I do admit a few of them are similar or the same track raced backwards. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/opticon_one/recommended/228940/","opticon_one","Opticon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/opticon_one/","18 products in account","Promise: the teleportation aspect of this game shows a lot of it. I found this game during Jagex's free weekend sample. So far it's held my attention for a couple of hours. Sale price is worth it. It seems simple at first but the unlockables expand the gameplay much further.\n\nI was hoping to use my wired X360 controller, and after the momentary discomfort of not seeing any configuration options, I discovered the controller worked after pressing start and mashing all the buttons to find out what does what.\n\nMost of this game is merely serviceable. Environment graphics are solid, but the cars are a little too karty. The sounds are pretty average, the music is repetitive and forgettable, and you'd better be real happy seeing the same two pieces of character artwork, but the game itself has a deeper side if you care to look.\n\nFirst off, this game has a much slower tempo when compared to, say, Burnout or The Need For Speed series. If you're ok with a more casual, kartlike experience, this will be fine. Gameplay is pretty interesting in that you have the ability to "phase shift": through doing stunts or driving fast, you earn "PS" to open up strategically-placed warp gates that instantly connect you to another part of the track. This makes it constantly necessary to check your position, as a 1st place spot may not be guaranteed for very long.\n\nWhile this gimmick is pretty one-dimensional, it's fairly easy to advance through the stages. Each race has multiple objectives, like performing stunts, shooting other players, or beating a time trial. The good part is that you get paid for every race you complete. That's rignt: even if you failed to complete a single objective, you'll get paid something. This makes it pretty easy to upgrade your vehicle.\n\nThe upgrade system makes the weapons MUCH better, and phase shifting is a lot of fun once you upgrade it to hold more than one charge at a time. Upgrading the vehicles is less interesting; since your opponents also get speed boosts, there's no real sense of improvement. Thankfully, this is offset by the weapons themselves, most of which can be given additional functions. Combined with the PS upgrades, online matches quickly turn into a teleportation contest, as you can be shot, teleport closer to your assailant, shoot him, then teleport away and perform a barrel roll off a ruined temple. You can even teleport through other people's warp gates, which makes the mechanic of PS a bit more strategic.\n\nThe only things I didn't really like were that singleplayer seemed to hit a spike in difficulty about halfway through. Until that point there wasn't much of a challenge, but suddenly the AI gets aggressive. There also doesn't seem to be a rearview mirror, which would be helpful (and entertaining) to use. Finally, just the ability to configure my controller would be great. I haven't (yet?) experienced the bugs that other reviewers seem to have hit.\n\nCarnage Racing is much more casual than the name implies, which is great if you're looking for a casual kart racer. "Serious" gamers should probably stay away, but it wouldn't be the worst thing to pick if you have $10 US burning a hole in your pocket.","July 27, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It doesn't feel too loose or too tight.  The weapons are relatively straightforward and require a bit of skill to properly target.  This is a positive for me as well, as I don't see the point in having all the weapons just auto-hit.  It also provides the opportunity for you to evade the weapons of other drivers.\n\nThe game looks attractive, the levels are visually interesting, though somewhat lacking in variety.  While there are probably 20+ levels, they share only about 4 or 5 actual maps.  The cars look shiny and colorful.\n\nThe multiplayer seemed reasonably populated, and didn't seem to suffer from any major latency/lag.  It made for an enjoyable experience.\n\nOverall, this is a fun little casual racing game, and if you can get it on sale, I'd say it's worth the price of admission.","June 30, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Used to play it in FB when it was Beta season. On Steam it could be cheaper. And in its bad side.. it only needs more promotion, so actual real online players join. Playing against computer is not always fun. I want to send this game to a friend and they can't see the ''Buy'' button. PLEASE PROMOTE THE GAME, PROMOTE, PROMOTE!! And ANYONE who plays Carnage Racing, feel free to add me so we can enter to races together. I bet to you I'll give you a hard time winning ;)","December 3, 2015","true","46.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a fun little arsenal to choose from as well as nicely designed tracks at your disposal. The car choices are slim, so if you want variety like that offered in games like Midnight Club, you may be a bit disappointed. Altogether, it's much like Mario Kart, with unnecessary (and most likely illegal) weaponry to slow down your opponents, and fire straight into the lead!","February 1","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
