It is an A-RPG at it's core, with a story, albeit short at the moment. I do recommend you give this game a shot, if you had fun with other ARPG's, even Binding of Isaac fans could really get into this, altough it has more in terms of items, and managing things. I guess I will do the standard Pros and Cons for people here. . .\n\nPros:\n1:  Game has fun old-school style graphics (I enjoy at least, not everyone's cup of tea I understand though)\n2:  You control a starship and crew, with mechs to help you in battle if you choose\n3:  Action-RPG that rewards skill, as opposed to just rewarding grinding as many turned based RPG's do (This is not  turned based obviously being an ARPG\n4:  Many upgrades for yourself, and upgrades for your mechs\n5:  You can board enemy ships, to take them as your own, or buy a better ship if you want instead\n6:  You can choose to play as a fighter or a commander, either going in and leveling while killing, or letting mechs do the   work and staying in the back\n7:  The price of this game is very low, and IMHO you will get your money's worth of hours of fun\n8:  Walking around areas, using the action key, you find genetic material or download data or find parts to upgrade mechs all space stations and stuff. Stuff that looks like part of the scenery, actually holds value, which I find endearing. It doesn't stick out, and scream "COME GET ME." You have to use your brain on this one folks.\n\nCons:\n1:  There are some bugs, although the developer responded FAST on the boards, then patched some problems same day.\n2:  The resolutions are a bit funky, and you must restart the game for them to take effect, some of them cause the game to be half off the screen, at least on my monitor.\n3:  The controls are a bit wonky as well, as how you move is very basic, 4 directions only for facing, can't fire in diagonal, and to fire you push numbers 1 thru 4, while using the WASD to move, is very hard on the fingers. (Can use numpad to move to make it a lot easier, not sure if you can rebind firing keys, as that would be very handy)\n4:  Taking Damage from enemies can be somewhat delayed / non-informative. They fire 4 or 5 shots at you, and each does 400 damage, and you die near instantly before being able to react.\n5:  From what I can tell, there is not information when killing an enemy on experience earned, or how far from a level you are, or what is in those brown sacks they drop that you pick up. I assume it is credits, but it gives no information.\n\n\nAll in all, this game is a good buy, and the developer has already commented that he is looking into adding the ability to build your own space station in the game. Things like that, are so unique to a game like this, and I love that he is considering it, and not just going and doing the same tropes that 3/4's of the developers do nowadays.","August 17, 2015","true","5.6"," 96 of 111 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","96","111","5","0"

Every single part of the UI is as bare bones as you can get, no polish whatsoever, and chalk full of bugs. Even simple things like fullscreen vs. windowed mode is pretty broken. For example, when you die in windowed mode, the game goes back to fullscreen mode until you change it again. Also, in less than an hour of play time, I've experienced 3 crashes due to some mouse script the game is running. And why on Earth is the game "always on top" of other windows?!\n\nHopefully the dev will one day see that user experience is extremely important and fix all the issues and polish the UI, as the game really might be something worth playing. Until then, however, it is very difficult to reccomend this game... to anyone.","October 19, 2015","false","6.9"," 66 of 71 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","66","71","5","0"

Till you Figured out that keeping the mous on the middle of the screen solves the problem.\n- THe resolution options of the game dont work properly. If you change the resolution the screen gets of center so you cant see things like health or shield\n- Sometimes for no reason you cant board spacestations or planets. The game keeps you on your ship and you can try it over and over again with no chance to broad anything\n- Sometimes the game gets stuck in a loop of spaceshipfights. That actually happend only once and leaded me to glitch the hell out of the game. Because everytime you try to scan a space object a fight with an enemyspaceship breaksout. In my case the enemy was a puny little ship that didn't match mine in any aspect, so it took me no time to defeat it foor about 50 times, but you got always new loot from it. After that i got bored and made some missions and broke the stuck loop.\n\nSo if there is any update wich would fix the problems above than it will be a gem in retro gaming but actually its not.","August 21, 2015","false","16.3"," 65 of 94 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","65","94","5","1"

It's got a starwars-spacesim feeling to it while being an oldschool sandbox rpg. There are missions you can do such as bounty hunting, collector missions, missions for earth government such as destroying enemies. You can walk inside your spaceship at any time and equip your own character with armour and different weapons. You can even throw grenades while battling. You can also beam down with your mechs and they help you, but the low-tech mechs are stupid and bump into walls a lot while better mechs are more efficient. There are many items to find and collect and use for stuff like improving your mechs.  Loving the game and surprised by its depht i'm taking a small break then playing all night. That's why i don't have many hours of playtime but i will play it a lot and do bounty hunter missions, they're my favorite :)","August 18, 2015","true","4.6"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","19","25","3","0"

By sheer dumb luck I noticed a file named 1366w.txt in the game directory which led me to this thread:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/363510/discussions/0/537405286658273077/\n\nWith that I was able to get the game running in 1280x720 resolution and play for some time.  Not really the most user friendly thing, and really should be fixed by making a small loader program to make this change for you then run the game.\n\nBeyond that, the game is okay from what I've seen so far.

Firstly it is huge! Not only do there seem to be many and varied missions, but there is also an option to fly around random space. I personally prefer this mode as every time you encounter something in space you enter your ship and get to chat with your crew. It feels as though you are a Star-Trek captain J\n\nThere also seems to be a really interesting story although I’ve not played it all the way through yet as the missions for it become difficult quickly. This is not a game for those that like to be hand-held but instead makes you work things out for yourself (which I personally like). TBH I’m not even sure how you could explain everything to the user as there is so much going on, so much to buy, and so many ways to play.\n\nDefinitely worth a look for such a small cost!","September 8, 2015","true","70.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

I used WASD as well as the Up Down Left Right Arrows and the numpad. Enter Esc for buying.\n\nI was actually quite surprised by the amount of material in this game. There were at least four stores and two I have yet to figure out. I'm guessing to craft. Anyways, I'm playing this game at my own pace, which is slow, so there is much more to explore and learn.

I wondered long if this one works better and if i should buy it... though i see they both share the same kind of combat engine. Surely this one will work better right?\n\nNo. It's terrible. And i have come to the conclusion that this game engine just isn't cut for fun action oriented gameplay. Sure you can get this to work somewhat but the fun part is just missing. Combat on ships is something that i can imagine some people love despite(or because) the sluggish way the characters move giving you a stuttering Archon -like linearity to combat. Fortune's Tavern dejavuu is very strong here.\n\nThe biggest sin i think this game engine brings to the table is that it overshadows the story. You are spendng so much time on being annoyed by it that you just dont even care about the story. Yes i understand, some people like it. But i just can't as there really are WORKING action games such as Secret of Magia that does the action part right.\n\nNot going to be spending much ink on the game mechanics itself - i see others have already taken care of that. Instead i am going to just issue a general warning for action games that has this game engine underneath. Now by this i dont mean rpgmaker games generally as  i have recently learn't to like a lot of more traditional rpgmaker games but this particular engine that is used on the more action oriented games is just a general disaster and i will avoid it like the plague in the future.","May 11","false","4.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game has you focusing on exploring the stars in your ship, allowing you to fly from planet to asteroid to space station, and even get into space-faring battles with other ships.\n\nThe game is made in RPG maker, an engine over the years that has had it's fair share of mediocre and lazy titles. But thankfully, I'm happy to report that this is not the case. As instead of using the typical RPG maker assets and combat system, the developer has opted for their own. The in-game assets are nice to look at and fit the overall sci-fi theme well, so if you're looking for an RPG maker game that likes to put in some effort into their games, this is definitely one for you.\n\nThe combat isn't turn based like the usual RPG maker games, but instead has gone for a more action-oriented combat style. While exploring the stars, you are more than likely to come across your fair share of combat on different worlds, asteroids, and what not. You'll beam down, and that's where it all begins! You move around the screen like you normally would, but around you is a number of enemies, who will not hesitate to shoot you in the face the first chance they get. Luckily, you also have access to a form of attack, also known as your laser gun. By pressing 1, you fire a shot in whatever direction you may be facing, although sadly you cannot shoot diagonally, something I would quite like to see in a future update maybe. Thankful though, there is no delay between shots, so feel free to hit that fire button as hard as you please, because you can assume the AI of your opponents are doing the exact same!\n\nOne upside to the combat, is you don't need to go it alone all the time. Providing where you're going allows, you can bring down a mech with you, or 6 if you managed to get a ship with that number of mech bays. Mech's are AI partners that work pretty similar to your AI opponents, except on the upside that they work for you. Once you've loaded in to the level, these ruthless killers will go out in search for something that is set to do you harm. The mech's are a wonderful addition to the game, as they help you immensely on almost all missions you go on. Your character is pretty squishy from the get go, so allowing your mech's to deal with the brunt of the enemies on each level is a tactic that is well worth using often. Which is actually why I spent the majority of my money upgrading my mech's, just because they are more or less literal killing machines.\n\nTechnically, there's a subsidiary to the combat system, which is the ship on ship combat. This isn't nearly as exciting as the regular combat, as the gist of it is just move closer, or further away, depending on how close you are to the enemy ship you use a different weapon, be it lasers, cannons, or missiles. Along with those attacks, you have tactics, like boost shields (restore health), disable their engines so they can no longer move closer or further away from you, disabling their option to flee from you. Then there's beam aboard once they are below 50 shields, allowing you to go onto their ships and take it out using yourself and the mech's, allowing you to take over and control the ship, something I haven't yet been able to achieve, as the bugger's block me every single time I've tried to do it!!\n\nThe game has a rather light-hearted take on itself, which you soon find out when you first try and upgrade your mech's, as your crew-mate says, "You may have noticed the AI is pretty bad, bumping into walls and all that. Probably warrants an upgrade or two." It was nice to see some humour and see that the game didn't take itself too seriously, as I feel it would of subtracted from the overall experience a little if it had.\n\nNow, before I touch upon the story, and a little more meat of the game, I'm just quickly going to mention that there are a couple of spelling and grammatical errors from time to time, most frequent in the tutorial I believe, but I can imagine it's something that will be patched out in an upcoming update or patch. Now, onto the story!\n\nStar-Box has you in search of your Mother's ship. Not a Mothership, literally your Mother's ship. You've taken to the stars in search of your mother (and her ship). I would say more, but the story so far hasn't been a main drawing point for me, that's the sandbox element the game employs.\n\nJust like in any sandbox game, you're free to go and follow the story to your hearts content, but if you're like me, then you're going to ignore it until you've done more or less everything else first, which is exactly what I did. I picked up some quests, and went straight to them, something the game allows you to do, removing the need to explore for them when you can just go straight to them, something I actually quite like in this game, but something I imagine not all players will feel the same about. The exploring and sandbox elements are easily my favourite, as you're free to just go out and do what you want, pretty much from the very get go, something I wholeheartedly recommend to see what the game has to offer. It also allows you to make as much cash as you can fathom, of which I quickly used to upgrade my mech to turn him into one hell of a beast!\n\nNow, before I give you an overall gist of how I feel, there are just a few things I thought were really quite interesting that add something different to the game. First off, there's a little debuff you can get if you explore certain items, which is an alien disease which slowly decreases your stats if you don't deal with it quickly. It's nice to see that there is something a little detrimental when it comes to exploring, as your character is touching test tubes, picking flowers they've never seen before, who knows what in the world they could do to you, so it gives you a reason to think twice before picking up something up that may not be great for your health. As well as the random debuff, there's the tax mechanic. At the main hub of the game, also known as "Earth" is a number of vendors, where you can buy almost whatever you please, but! They have a 100% tax added to them, meaning you will be paying double for whatever it is you want to purchase. You can do a few things to combat this! You can explore the far reaches of space, and look for a black market, where their tax is significantly lowered for you, but will only remain there until you've left the sector. You can either do that, or swallow your pride and just take the 100% tax with your purchase, or!! You can do missions for the military, and lower your tax rate with each mission you complete, which is a mechanic I really enjoy as it gives the player an incentive to go out and do their missions, other than just the original cash promised for completing it.\n\nOverall, Star-Box has quite a bit to offer to anyone this might appeal to. It has some mechanics you don't normally see, gives players a good number of reasons to explore the sandbox elements of it all, and has some light-hearted humour to go along with it. The game isn't without its issues, with a few bugs or glitches here and then, but I have no doubt they will be soon patched out in one of the next few updates. And speaking of updates, the game got updated a day after I started playing, and they've already added new content in the form of drones, which makes ship combat a little more strategic and interesting for the player. Over time, the game is only going to get better, more optimised and more enjoyable by the sounds of things with more content and all sorts. This seems to be a sandbox game that's worth keeping an eye on, and I know it's something I shall be doing, as so far, the game most certainly deserves it.","August 23, 2015","true","3.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The tutorial is super-useful too, and not just a rushed-out tutorial like some games, it has its own script!\n\nPlaying it for a good length of time, I can easily recommend this game 10/10! :)","August 18, 2015","true","1.0"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","14","25","2","0"

But, so did the Atom Bomb. I've already uninstalled this once but came back when I noticed the 2016 updates, hoping things had shaped up. Not certain how a game with RPG Maker graphics and only being about 212 (ish) MB in size can be so laggy. It's certainly just, as laggy, as before. Using arrow keys in the "closet" to change my loadout the selection bar still jumps over and around items like a sadistic game of drunken leap-frog. I'm re-uninstalling the game and noticed you have pay for DLC... So you have DLC for a game that just barely works and has nearly the same issues as when it was released. Real ♥♥♥♥ move, man. Real ♥♥♥♥ move.\n\nI'd certainly like my money back and maybe steam will actually start taking into account the steaming bowls of ♥♥♥♥-chowder they allow on their market?

STAR-BOX is a game you can sit down and play for a few minutes or longer if you're looking to kill some time. The first time I played I easily put an hour into it. I only had some minor issues; nothing that would be considered a deal-breaker (for me).\n\nIssues I had:\n-All sounds cut out on the second level of a ship I boarded. (Sounds came back once I moved onto the third level).\n-Lasers wouldn't fire when I pressed 1. Tested a couple more times and lasers still wouldn't fire.\n-Laser randomly fired (ended up hitting my mech).\n-Game slowed down and encountered some delays when opening menus (inventory, etc). This problem occured on the same level I lost all sounds. Once I moved on to the next level, the game returned to it's normal speed(s).\n\nOther than those small issues, I would recommend this game.\n","August 24, 2015","true","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Gameplay for the most part is great. You run around and loot things with your mech buddy/buddies to improve things like your armor/clothes, your mechs and other things, Flying the space ship is a bit confusing at first because you have no sense of movement because the background doesn't move with your ship. The story in this game is amazing too.\n\n- Crashes do occur, but the dev is ontop of things to fix them and push out patches.\n\nIn the end, I do recommend 10/10 because of the hardworking developer, quirky graphics and awesome gameplay.

Some menu options are impossible to select due to the lag. I wanted to like it but I couldn't deal with the programming issues. Because of this I sent first refund request.

So the controls are very simple - WASD or arrows to move around, space or enter for confirming. Thats ok, but navigating menus is only possible with arrows, escape sometimes act as spacebar (confirming menu and then closing it), text speed is slow, like very slow, and there is way to accelerate it - Press space.

I bought both games because im a big fan of the genres and they tend to be my favourite games.\n\nBoth games have clunky controls/interface and it's just frustrating to do anything.\n\nIll concentrate on this game for this review.\n\nInitial tutorial mission, my "pet" mech kills all the bad guys. I guess that's ok as it's a tutorial and Im bound to turn into the bad ♥♥♥ eventually. I fire a few shots and realise that as soon as I press fire my character is forced to stop. Why? This is when my burgeoning hopes for the game started to fall.\n\nTutorial ship to ship combat. Advised I can board a ship if it's below 50 shields. Get ship below 50 shields. Repeated attempts to board are blocked. Figuring If i take out the shields completely I'll do hull damage and have a better chance of boarding. Reduce shields to 0 and ship is gone. Destroyed. Received various items that I don't really have a use for.\n\nStill thinking I can have fun in the game, I choose to go to random space rather than earth.\n\nStop at the first asteroid I see, click on it and get a message telling me it's just a worthless rock. "Fine", I think and try to move on, but clicking doesn't get rid of the msg (which it had in every other text so far in the game) and space doesn't do anything either. Have to press "o" to go back to ship then click on the ship monitor to go back to exploring space (which took me a few goes too because sometimes the character just walks away from the monitor.)\n\nTried this with a few more asteroids, exact same problem.\n\nIgnoring this bug thinking "ok, ill just stay away from asteroids" I fly to a new sector of random space. I spot a planet!\n\nNow i think "Yay I can do some exploring and have fun!". Press "Scan sector" from ship. Nothing. I'm directly over the planet. Try it two more times. Nope. Game tells me there's nothing there. It's clearly a giant bogey on the viewing monitor.\n\nPress "o" to go back to ship. Character walks up and down a few times instead of using the monitor. Finally uses monitor. NOW there's a planet there. Oh ok. So the planet only exists if I scan from the ship monitor, not from space.\n\nThat's when I stopped playing.\n\nI forgot to add that I had the exact same error message when trying to load the game initally that I had when trying to load Fortunes Tavern. There's a working fix but... second game and same error?\n\nAnyway I don't want to make the Dev have a bad day. I really want to enjoy your games but the user interface is really killing it for me.\n\nI'd honesly rather have a working turn based environment than the UI currently used. I've never used RPG Maker and I don't know if it's a limitation of the engine.\n\nDev - great game ideas and you obviously have some talent and strength to make/release games but your UI is stopping me enjoying them.","January 10","false","0.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But make sure to equip that robe with +2 defense on it before a dragon shoots a fireball at your head or you pick a fight with an alien warship that seems to ignore your attempts to fight it by flying away as your weak missles bounce off its shields.\n\nNot a bad game for under $10","August 17, 2015","true","0.9"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","12","28","3","0"
