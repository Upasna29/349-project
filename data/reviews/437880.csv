Enter Main Loop are a couple of young developers from the United Arab Emirates who have partnered up to create one of the stronger precision platform games that I've played recently. Considering that I've covered games such as Izbot, Sym and In Between already this years I think that puts it among some pretty solid company.\n\nWhat makes Project Graviton a solid game in my estimations is that it genuinely feels easy enough for newbies to learn how to play yet hard enough that you're going to feel as though you've really earned it by the end of play. I think that is a huge component of what constitutes a good precision platformer. Of course you have your simplistic graphics that are more than acceptable and have almost become the norm in this genre and a pretty solid soundtrack to go along with it too but it's the actual gameplay that matters most and I quite enjoyed my time with this one.\n\nThe only negative counting against the game is that there are only nine levels spread across three acts. If you're an precision platform expert you're likely going to be finished with the game in about half an hour and if you're a newbie it should take you an hour or more dependent upon how quickly you're able to pick up the basic skills required to reach a successful completion. However,  the content that constitutes those nine levels is some of the most enjoyable platforming action I have come across.\n\nI'm generally loathe to call precision platforming 'enjoyable' and more apt to consider it 'rage inducing.' Though I, myself, will never be the most skilled player I can still appreciate well designed platform games. That's what Project Graviton is. And if you're needing to satiate a hunger in your gameplay then this is a fantastic 'snack' for you to chew on.\n\nNote: one thing that I did not appreciate at all about the game was the fact that when I alt-tabbed out of the game in order to take notes, etc. the left-hand side of my keyboard was essentially rendered useless. I'm talking the shift button to capitalize words and the control button. Originally I had no idea what had happened and so logically given that this much beloved keyboard is older than my new computer I thought it was broken. I was in the process of exiting all of my programs and apps to reset my PC to see if that would help when I tried again after exiting the game to find that everything was working again. Please, if at all possible, fix this.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways visit us at http://www.steamified.com/\nWhy don't you join us on Steam at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified","February 15","true","18.4"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

I asked myself this question several times over the couple of hours I spent playing Project Graviton. While the main "narrative" only spanned about 30 minutes for me, the appeal of trekking back through Project Graviton's tougher sections in hopes of snagging all of the collectible items kept me bordering entertained and fuming for about 2 whole hours.\n\nThis game is tough. From the start, it is made abundantly clear that precision platforming is key in Project Graviton. In regard to gameplay, think Super Meat Boy. You'll even encounter saw blades that call back to that title - and tons of red things to be gravely afraid of. The platforming here is very tightly controlled. You can move, jump, and combine a dedicated running button with jumping to clear larger gaps and shoot past obstacles. After some minor frustration - or, maybe challenge is a better word - you'll acquire a suit that allows you to change gravity's effect on the protagonist. This allows for the already pretty challenging levels to immediately rocket off into hellishly difficult territory that will cause you to do one of several things. You will be faced with the terrifying reality that collecting all of the little blue bits and finishing the level you've been stuck on for 20 minutes might be mutually exclusive ideas. I cranked the speed up to 11 and motored through these levels like I'd never even been introduced to the concept of collectibles on my first playthrough. To this point, I still have not been able to grab every blue treasure-y bit in Project Graviton. Luckily, in this endeavor, I'm becoming more familiar and capable of utilizing the 3 checkpoints given at the beginning of each level. The player can place these checkpoints at will, but each one disappears when you die - meaning that it's back to the starting line if you die and then forget to place another checkpoint. This lead me to some infuriating moments when I placed a checkpoint somewhere unsafe - died, and immediately reloaded to find that I'd died again in a blink of an eye. Back to the beginning, I guess.\n\nI was impressed with the techno soundtrack and felt that it meshed well with the gameplay and aesthetic - and it never felt like it was droning on. As far as visuals go, this is standard 2D platformer fare. While smart, quirky animation goes a long way to giving the protagonist some personality, it's regrettable that this adventure looks so much like ones you've taken with other running and jumping characters over the years.\n\nLastly - there actually is some story at play here. I mean, don't think you're going to be enthralled by a tale of love and loss - but do expect some kinda funny dialogue and a short enough running time for the game that the dialogue doesn't have a chance to be anything other than endearing. I was actually shocked at how much I wanted to see the plot keep moving forward when the credits started rolling.\n\nProject Graviton is fun and challenging. In no way are you gonna discover some unique platforming experience you'll never ever have again - but you will find something that tows the line between fun and rage-inducing long enough to leave a pretty good impression for the price of a low-premium phone app.\n\nGameplay - 63\nVisuals/Art Style - 61\nSound - 71\nContent-to-cost at $1.79 - 73\n\nFor what it's worth, I give Project Graviton on PC a 67/100.","February 15","true","1.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Each level gets more intense as you progress, as the soundtrack meshes well with it. Has a nice sense of humour to blend with the difficulty of the game. Gravity suit brings the challenge and fun on how to clear a level, especially if you're trying to collect all the chips. Definitely a worthy change from all the typical side-scrollers.","February 17","true","0.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"
