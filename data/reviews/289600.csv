A scope added to a rifle adds the little scope window like the old delta force games, simple but neat. Overall it reminds me of STALKER, it has the scavenger and survival element. Bullets are currency, reminds me of METRO. I'm only a few hours in and my character is still level 1, but in that short time, i feel as though I'm guiding my vulnerable character through a chernobyl/apocolyptic combination of areas, I'll update this if anything changes, only problem I've had so far is slowdown on the cutscenes, and sometimes enemies slip through doors when your in combat and occasional clipping issues. I'm off back to play it.\n\nUpdated- Yes, I can fully recommend this game (for the price), it has a similar overall structure to silent storm, it has roughly the same size gameplay areas, and is equally engaging. When you first start, you're like a hobo with a shotgun, running around loads, trying to avoid fire as you're constantly reloading the shotgun, while avoiding knife and axe weilding enemies. It gets a bit chaotic.  Fast forward to level 6 (where I am now) and you will have raided army bases and found military hardware (rifles, smg's,scopes, lasers and suppressors) The professor in the market can upgrade weapon parts),you'll find new comrades to help in the good fight. It reminds me at this point of the old 80's film Red Dawn, as I now have a small guerrilla squad who cause maximum damage using stolen hardware and ambush tactics (mines,grenades and tripwires).\n\nThe story progresses each time you speak to your wife and rest in your bed, your house (which is in an abandoned appartment building slowly becomes your battle castle, getting more defensive as you play. It is not a game to be rushed, planning is everything. for instance- make sure your inventory is properly managed, it costs more action points to reload your weapon if your magazines are in your backback, than if they were in your vest or pockets, make sure you have filled magazines ready for a reload. I didnt find the micro management a chore, it's a neccessity to winning a firefight, and satisfying when you do.\n\nIf you do buy this, first thing to do is go into the mouse and keyboard settings and turn the sensitivity up, as its set to zero. it's a good idea to learn all of the quick keys too, I had a problem trying to remap some of them. IMO this game is worth the price and hopefully we'll see more of them on steam.","April 4, 2014","true","51.1"," 103 of 119 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","103","119","0","0"

Sadly, they are no longer in gaming industry, for almost five years now.  If you liked this game you should check their other projects - E5 and 7.62. Those games are very flawed, just like this one, but its all from the lack of funding - tactical RPGs are not very popular today. Nonetheless they are still great games, and fantastic experience for fans of JA and XCOM. And gun nuts. Literally, hundreds of firearms.\n\nAnd one more thing i must mention. Translation. Here we are dealing with atrocious, embarrassing, ugly and unholy kind of translation. I am Russian, though i prefer playing western games in English, so my Steam language is English, and due to a bug i am stuck playing this game, again, in English. And it is terrible. This game is based off a book, actually, and very fine one. Dialogues are great, but they are full of idiomas and phrases that are very hard to translate, and since translators were pretty incopetent you are missing a lot.\n\nSo, if you liked this game i strongly suggest that you read the book it's based off - Berkem Al Atomi's "The Marauder". I just hope that it has a decent translation.\n\nAnd excuse me for my English, i know it is terrible.","April 7, 2014","true","14.8"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","46","51","0","4"

Count me in!\n\nI enjoyed Jagged Alliance and 7,62 (with the obligatory Blue Sun Mod), as well as all the S.T.A.L.K.E.R.s, Fallouts, etc. So this looked like a good marriage of concepts to me right off the bat. Add to this the unpretentious Russian storytelling, avoiding worn out game clich√©s and the main character being a cynical bearded man with cool comments and the game turns out really enjoyable. I finished it in just under 50 hours, which was a bit disappointing, as I enjoyed some epic battles there, and the story had potential to expand further...\n\nThe atmosphere is overall a bit postapoc-gloomy, but not depressing, just well fitting a random NPC's comment "Why is this country so f**ked up?" and the music unobtrusively complements it, although one "heavy metal" battle track can begin to grate on you a bit. Your character walks around with a leisurely pace (you can speed up, slow down or pause time anytime you like, if the action is too slow or too fast for you), exploring, scavenging anything useful, fighting bandits, looters, corrupt cops, hostile army troops, blowing up stuff, doing quests and following the main story plot as it unfolds.\n\nThe combat element is quite good, reminiscent of that in 7,62, with the game pausing when enemies are spotted or heard (or whichever way you setup your pausing preferences) or anytime you press SPACE, each action taking a certain amount of time to complete and you nervously checking the timer, will your character reload in time to shoot the bad guy, before he shoots you. Your character's stats play an important role in combat, so make sure you tweak them to your playing style (invest accordingly whether you are gonna be a hidden sniper or a charging commando). Particularly important are hearing and seeing, as your enemies will do their best to flank you and sneak up on you and your life depends on detecting where they are at any given time. I was pleasantly surprised that the AI isn't stupid and does not just blindly advance towards you, but tries to use cover, gets on your flanks to shoot at you when you don't see him, investigates noises and your last known position, etc. Combat can also be quite difficult, particularly when you've got a a nearly empty clip and several enemies advancing on you as they aren't bad shots either. So for some more difficult battles, you will likely die a lot and frequent saving is recommended. But sucessfully winning a difficult battle by employing various tactical tricks and approaches is very satisfying and looting fallen enemies can be quite rewarding too, if a bit too micromanagerial.\n\nThe camera commands are a bit clunky, but once you get used to turning the view with your right mouse button, zooming in and out with the wheel and moving the view with WSAD (hold shift for faster camera movement), you'll have good spacial awareness and control of the battlefield. One of the more annoying things is that the camera can get stuck indoors when you wanna look outdoors, and you have to "walk" it out of a door or window. There are also some other bugs that occur, like some talk or menu text suddenly switching to Russian (when it was English just moments before), your custom assigned keys resetting each time you enter the setup menu and the occasional crash, but I've encountered nothing too frustrating or gamebreaking and could bring the game to a conclusion.\n\nOverall, if you enjoy this sort of game, tactical fights, RPG elements and atmosphere and can overlook a few bugs, you probably won't be disappointed.","April 5, 2014","true","47.7"," 58 of 70 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","58","70","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/felipepepe/recommended/289600/","felipepepe","Felipepepe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/felipepepe/","734 products in account","Aperion‚Äôs previous game, 7.62 High Calibre, was a real-time open world tactical RPG, heavily inspired by the Jagged Alliance series. While rather buggy and with a boring storyline, its complex simulationist combat and highly detailed ‚Äúgun porn‚Äù conquered quite a few devout fans.\n\nMarauder, also known as Men of Prey in Europe, is instead a linear, story-driven game, based on a book series by the same name from Russian author Berkem Al Atomi. The game places you in the boots of Akhmetzyanov, a common man trying to survive an alternate-history Russia where the government collapsed, anarchy reigns and the US is invading.\n\nDon‚Äôt expect a pleasant game. Ahkmet himself is neither a virtuous paragon nor a noble-hearted anti-hero ‚Äì just a man trying to survive with his wife, at any cost. You will fight militias, rogue cops, raiders and cannibals, but also desperate, starved neighbors trying to take some of your precious food.\n\nMarauder‚Äôs combat perfectly reinforces its harsh atmosphere. The unique real-time with pause system from High Calibre is still here, if slightly streamlined. Every action takes a set time to be performed, and each has its pros and cons. The shotgun is a sure kill at close range, but it takes 0.42 seconds to ready it, while a pistol-wielding enemy can fire in just 0.08 seconds. You must take that into account in order to survive.\n\nWhile I usually prefer turn-based tactical games, Marauder‚Äôs intense and nerve-wrecking battles make great use of the game‚Äôs elaborate real-time system.  To add to the challenge, Ahkmet can only see what‚Äôs in front of him and must otherwise rely on hearing to guess the enemy‚Äôs position. This is further accentuated by the game‚Äôs overwhelming odds, pitting you alone against dozens of looters or a full elite military squad with nothing but a rifle, some mines and your wits.\n\nThe game keeps the extensive and highly detailed armory found in High Calibre, with almost a hundred weapons, and adds a few more RPG mechanics to the formula, such as character creation, a skill tree and lockpicking. You‚Äôll also get up to three companions as the plot advances, allowing for more complex tactics.\n\nSadly, Marauder is extremely linear. Besides the main story, you‚Äôll only be able to visit a bazaar, do a couple of side-quests and have one-line conversation with a handful of NPCs. And the dialogs are all in Russian, with poorly translated English subtitles.\n\nRough, challenging and intense, Marauder is an unique low budget tactical RPG. Its bleak story, harsh setting, high difficulty and complex combat are a sure treat to cold-blooded tactical enthusiasts.\n\nPS: I strongly recommend to manually edit the game‚Äôs config files. That way you can unlock higher resolutions and better camera controls.","May 3, 2015","true","12.7"," 38 of 42 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","38","42","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/murikov/recommended/289600/","murikov","Murikov","http://steamcommunity.com/id/murikov/","327 products in account","¬´No one wants to buy me for a handful of cereals!‚Äâ¬ª\n- Random woman in Bazaar\n\nMarauder, also known as Man of Prey, is a title which has a very soft spot in my gamer heart. There are some minor bugs, the story cutscenes are constantly freezing on modern systems and some ethical elements in the story indeed leave you behind with a raised eyebrow.\n\nBut if you've got a thing for turnbased strategy games like Jagged Alliance 2 or Marauder's spiritual predecessors Brigade E5 or 7,62 High Calibre, then this game is totally for you. Because of its appealing post-apocalyptic setting even fans of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. or the Metro series may take a look at this game.\n\nThe story, based on the same-named novel by Russian writer Berkem al Atomi, keeps you hooked for about 30 hours and is pretty unique. You control Akhmet, a Russian muslim and former army sapper, through the outskirts of a deserted city south of the Ural mountains. After a Russian political approach to NATO and the west, the US Army invades Russia under the pretext of a Peacekeeper Mission. The huge country therefore falls into chaos and soon anarchy spreads out. Akhmet and his lovely wife must now try to survive through this indeed chaotic cluster‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. As the game title already suggests, Akhmet does so in looting and fighting off bandits, stray dogs, corrupt policemen and even foreign soldiers. Interestingly Akhmet is not a good guy in the proper sense. He doesn't really care for the wellbeing of other dwellers or to bring justice all over the city. He only takes care of his family and its survival - whatever the cost. Soon he begins to fortify his apartment block against enemy raids...\n\nLike in 7,62 High Calibre you control Akhmet from above and you can pause the game at all times. While the game is paused you can plan your next moves and give Akhmet (and later his companions) commands. Rather than taking away Action Points like in Jagged Alliance 2, all your actions require a certain amount of seconds, which will be counted down as soon as you un-pause the game. This gameplay element, called the Smart Pause Mode, may take a while to get used to it but works perfectly as soon as you progress. Once you also get your proper equipment the combat sequences are a blast - I've seldomly cheered so much while Vitek, our pro sniper in the team, scores another yet perfect headshot from hundreds of yards away. On top of that there is also a fancy skill system and upgradable character parameters. After levelling up you can invest points in better accuracy, stamina, barter skills or whatever comes in handy. The inventory, also similar to the one from the S.T.A.L.K.E.R.  series, is pretty simple and self-explanatory. In the Bazaar, the local city market, you can trade further equipment and even upgrade your weapons. Also note that, similiar to the Metro series, the local main currency in Marauder are 5.45x39mm cartridges, colloquially called ¬´fives¬ª.\n\nEven if all this suggests that Marauder is an open-world game, it sadly isn't. In fact the game is pretty linear and you move from one section to another while regularly returning to your house and the Bazaar. I wish the developers would had implemented more city sections back then, but even then it's an already quite immersive world.\n\nWhat really ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• me off is that the fancy story cutscenes always freeze on modern systems. This is already a well-known problem and nobody really knows how to fix it. Once again, it's an absolute impudence that the current publisher didn't give a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about fixing all these problems before releasing this game on Steam. Furthermore there are a couple of other bugs and sudden crashes, but those are pretty minor or rather quite uncommon from my point of view.\n\nEither way, please make sure to do the following steps before playing the game:\n\n#1 If you've got a large monitor, adjust your resolution according to this guide.\n#2 Adjust the poor camera controls according to this guide.\n#3 Fix the grenade launcher reloading bug according to this guide.\n#4 Please read Tin Tim's fantastic Let's Play Guide[lparchive.org] while playing. There you can watch all story cutscenes that don't work in the game itself! Furthermore it provides you with excellent hints and not too much spoilers.\n\nThe Good:\n+ Quite detailed graphics\n+ Immersive world and creepy Eastern Bloc atmosphere\n+ Innovative story\n+ Awesome combat\n+ Lots of weapons (unfortunately not many NATO guns)\n+ Good skill, trade and inventory management\n+ Loot, loot and even more loot\n\nThe Bad:\n- Pretty linear\n- Some slowdowns during combat\n- The final sections of the story are quite unpolished\n- Those above mentioned bugs\n\nThe Ugly:\n-- Story cutscenes not working on modern systems! Argh!\n\nTo put it in a nutshell, this game really grows on you if you love turnbased tactical games with lots of guns and a post-apocalyptical setting. It still has its minor flaws, but the rewarding combat system just does it for me.

The Russian voice actors are quite good although I don't understand much Russian, they have character and combined with the translated dialogue, it creates a good atmosphere. The gameplay is kind of like very limited Fallout 1/2 with 3D graphics. The RPG-system is mostly about combat and this game and it's predecessor from Apeiron are often compared to Jagged Alliance 2 and XCOM. I have played too much of those games so I find the real-time/pause-battle system very refreshing and it's breath-takingly brilliant at best. The progression in the game is very linear and I was hoping it would have sandbox-gameplay with random battles but I guess 7.62: High Calibre is for that as it's almost the same engine. The camera is annoying to control and the game will probably annoy many western gamers who are not used to challenging UI. But this game is all about the combat and it's great. If you've played too much JA2/XCOM-games, then this game could blow your mind for a while as the battle system is more realististic and satisfying. It crashed a couple of times but the quick save works well. My dream game would be a polished, sandbox-style game that would use this combat system with better graphics and western quality UI etc. The plot was too short (could have had more battles with the yankees) and I really hoped there had been some mods available to continue the experience but at least I couldn't find any in English.","May 27, 2014","true","53.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The story so far is decent enough, the combat is excellent, and the graphics are pleasently nice looking.\n\nThe only real problem with the game is it's a little buggy from time to time, and the translation could've used more time put into it (Honestly, we were lucky to get anything at all). But overall, it's a damn fine game.\n\nThis is the crowning jewel of Apeiron, I really liked the concepts in their previous games, but couldn't get past the clunky interfaces, buggyness, and general unpolish. Marauder fixes all these problems, and just feels...Good. They really got their ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• together for this game.\n\nSo yeah, highly recommend it to anyone who's into squad based tactical strategy games.","July 14, 2014","true","3.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

S.T.A.L.K.E.R games were my favorite PC games of all times and people comparing this game to S.T.A.L.K.E.R are doing so bc the game's russian developed with russian voice actors and so-on and so-forth. Nothing from the atmosphere, the story, or the gameplay is that of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R games. BUT this game, though not at the level of S.T.A.L.K.E.R is still an awesome game!!! It's a tactical/strategic/survival-ISH game(u don't really need food and water to survive it just helps with health, though not much w/o certain skills)  w/ RPG character building elements (Skills, exp, etc). I"ve played Shadowrun, and 7.62 and i like this one better. PATIENCE IS A MUST to be able to get used to the camera as well as the all around beginning of the game.\nIs this game fun yes, do i reccomend it to certain players who'll enjoy the mix of rpg, tactics, and strategy HELL YEA!!! BUT this game isn't for younger kids or FPS lovers who want split second constant action and only care about action and fluidity when playing a game. The game has bugs.....bugs that actually kill this game from being amazing tbh such as you'll have a cut screen and the game will crap out... Before anyone says "that's never  happened to me" lol it's not my computer it is the game and plenty of people get the same random shutdowns. With that being said for you to play this game you also have the mindset to remember to SAVE OFTEN so that when a crash occurs you aren't SOL having to replay a mission again that maybe you barely won the last time lol.\nAll in all I love it, i think the storys solid and it's kind of like the person who translated the russian to english was using google translate so i find the translations hilarious in what they really mean, but again younger folks or people who want that COD, or GTA level development in a game will find it annoying possibly soooo yup not for ya if that's you. If you purchase this game go into it with an open mind and a patient attitude and you will be loving it if it's really the type of game you're into !!!","June 16, 2014","true","54.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I got the game on a sale, and it's totally worth the $2.49. $10 is on the verge of being too expensive for such an unpolished game. And the translation from Russian is plain horrible. That being said, and if you are able to overlook those facts, it's a really interesting game.\n\nYou play as Akhmet, this Muslim crazy Russian Unabomber with balls as big as the great USSR, trying to survive as a marauder when the NATO invades Russia.\n\nIt's based on a book that I haven't read, so the story line is all new to me. So far, the game is challenging for many reasons. It's pretty easy to die, which makes it realistic and fun, and the translation is just horrible.\n\nThe biggest problem, as mentioned before, is the translation. Because of this, sometimes it's unclear what you are supposed to do. But it's also part of it's charm. You have no clue what are they saying, but the subtitles are ridiculous and laughable. Good Laughable.\n\nYou are called by many names by other characters, but by far my favorite is "beard".\n"Hey, beard! Entrance ain't free. Gimme a five!"\n\nDealing with the traders is a constant source of laughter:\n\n"Are you ill, my friend?"\n"What the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• are you?"\n"I'm a doctor. Was a surgeon in the hospital before, and doing the same here. Name's Gennady. So what bothers you?"\n"I'm as strong as an ox. But pills could be useful. You have something for sale?"\n\nAkhmet is cocky, but because he can. He's the soviet Muslim Chuck Norris. It feels like they just added the language to make it more bad ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, as there is NO REASON to be rude to this poor guy. Other characters use all kinds of profanities as well, just for the sake of it.\n\nAfer the missions you go home back to your nagging wife. You are a lethal weapon with a heart of gold. All the killing you do, you do it to provide. That includes killing hobos and starving neighbors if they get on your way.\n\nThe game plays like many other tactical games, with a pause trigger that brings the game to a halt when an event requires your attention (No active task, enemy spotted, enemy heard, relevant object on your field of view, etc).\n\nIt has RPG elements, especially in character leveling, where you can choose perks and specializations. There's some dialog options, but that's about it.\n\nThe AI seems pretty weak. So far I've been able to use doors and let them come to take care of most of them. As long as they don't come in mobs, it's pretty simple to get a slug through their chests. But it's always more fun to go on the hunt with your big iron balls and show them who's boss.\n\nThe levels are kinda small but they really immerse you in the game world.\n\n\nOverall, worth trying it out...for the right price.","September 25, 2014","true","17.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

Yeah, game-is-not-for-everyone's-tastes.\n\nFirst, you should really like squad-tactics games like Jagged Alliance, Silent Storm or 7.62 and DON'T BE a graphics freak who wants everything in 16:9 with 60fps. Game's a bit dated, see? And still, it can be successfully compared by gameplay options even with latest tactics games. That slow-paced genre never was too hard about graphics. Physics, mechanics - that's a prime, but high resolutions... meh.\nSecond, be ready for glitches. Game and engine developers now either dead or missing, so there is no help in asking for patches. Although for the most part, game is running okay, except for cutscenes.\nThird and last is about moral - it's a game where a desperate man doing everything to survive, so if you like playing knights in white armor, that's surely a wrong game. Try "The Shining Force", maybe?\n\nNow, what's it all about? Well, it's a game based on the book "Marauder", bestselling in Russia, which were telling a story about a smooth and easy diplomatic victory of NATO forces. Russia is no more, sold to "West world" by some puppets and oligarchs, with "all included". Some cities like Moscow and Saint-Petersburg remains almost the same - just to decoy everything else that is going on in the once-a-great-country. And what is going there? Every big force in former state like paramilitary formations, or even some villages coalitions is methodically observed and negated by NATO "peacemakers". They called "mistresses" there, in sado-mazo sense, meaning they are masters and natives are slaves... Russkies are living in ruins of cities, without energy, fuel, water, food supplies. Anarchy and "homo homini lupus est" rule is prior for everyone. Our "hero" Ahmed, with the collapse of the state, is off to search for every piece of scrap he can use or sell, marauding and killing for own survival. Oh, grim apocalyptic future! Maybe it's close by already. I mean, look at eastern Ukraine...\n\nAnyway, although this game is constructed pretty linear, right along with the book plot, there is a little twist in the end, for which I'm so fond to this game. While in the book a protagonist fled away when his city was about to be "purified", in game we have a chance to strike back. To kill a slave in yourself! That's grand, really. Like killing Hitler or defending Alamo on your own.\nI'm spending all that much space revealing you the story, because it's the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•iest part in the game. Not a story itself, but the way of its telling. Cutscenes are bugged, I don't know anyone who could see it all without glitch. More to that, translation from russian to english were surely made by Promt software, or something like that. Those who answered for translation, should be burned alive, since they were lazy enough to bungle even with a tutorial!\n\nOkay, if you were able to read that all and still thinking "why I should buy it?", like I said from start - it's a good tactical game, highest evolution of Apeiron engine, knowing by "Brigade E5" and "7.62" games. Buy it with 75% discount, sell cards - and maybe you will have upper hand at the end of a deal, gaining more than spend.\n\n9/10 successful missions. The sapper makes only one mistake.\n\nPS: to turn on camera rotation in game fix "camera sensitiveness" setting from zero to twenty, at least. And maybe it will be wise to turn on "windows xp" compatibility with "e8.exe". Peace, people.","July 14, 2014","true","187.3"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","0"

I spent about 5 hours of real time playing out a gunfight which lasted about 10 minutes of game time.  Most of the time was spent re-loading after getting my head bashed in with a hachet, but I finally eliminated my neighbours and their occupy my apartment movement.  The gameplay pauses constantly (every time you hear or see something), this can be changed but it may seem annoying to some people.  The battles take a really long time to get through because of this.\nThe graphics are amusingly bad.  A shotgun blast makes a man bend over and touch his toes in slow motion, then fly across the hallway and bounce of the wall.  This wasn't meant to be a pretty game, but it winds up being sort of funny because of it.\nThe cut scene video seems to lag behind the voice over for me.  I don't think it's my computer, but it's not really a big deal anyway, the rest of the game plays fine.  All the voices are in Russian with subtitles, with a lot of humour thrown in with the nagging wife dialog.\nNow all that being said, this is an awesome game.  You need to be patient to play out a long gunfight, it's slow moving and makes for a good game to snack with.  If you liked Fallout Tactics, Jagged Alliance 2, Silent Storm, or Baldur's Gate then you should like Marauder.  It's not a bad buy at regular price, but a great deal when on sale.

I don't think I'm far into the game yet, being at 15hrs of gameplay, but the story is really interesting and the overall feel is great.\nWARNING:  This game has broken cutsecenes, the visual part of the cutscene stops but the audio keeps going, all the stuff is spoken in Russian but they do have subtitles in English.

It's a bit rough around the edges, with some bugs here and there, and the English translation is not very good, but I've been enjoying Marauder's intense battles and bleak Russian post-apocalyptic atmosphere immensely. The player character, a Russian Tatar called Akhmet, is not a regular hero. Actually he is more of an anti-hero, and not a very nice guy. Akhmet is not an evil man, but he is rather crude and his motives are mostly selfish. He will do almost anything to ensure his and his wife's survival. I really like this about him, as it makes him feel like a more realistic character, considering the setting where it's basically "every man for himself".\n\nThe graphics are dated, but good enough for me, and I like the small details like different gear changing the character's appearance and the gun's actually showing their attachments like scopes, lasers and silencers in the game.\n\nHighly recommended for people who like games like Jagged Alliance 2 and Silent Storm. Just remember it is not a turn-based game. If you have problems with the game's videos freezing, find the game's LP from LPArchive to see the translated videos.\n\nEdit: Some reviews are complaining about the extremely sluggish camera controls. I had a problem with this too, until I realized you can make the camera controls more sensitive from the options menu. Do that and controlling the camera will be easier. There are still some annoyances like trouble getting the camera through doorways or windows etc., but if that happens, just double click on Akhmet's portrait and the camera should take you to him (if you are far enough from him).","July 15, 2014","true","30.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

The smart pause system is fantastic for tactical shenanigans, and the tons of equipment you can find, modify, and accessorize really makes the inventory management nerd in me happy. The RPG stats and picking "perks" when you gain a level is extra icing on this delicious cake for me.\n\nThe translation is quite good, but has some of the typical weirdness associated with most Russian to English conversions (some of the introductions you make at the bazaar come off as abusive when I think they were shooting for casual). It's also a bit incomplete in places, but nothing that makes the game impossible to play (some NPC floating chats, markings of a few objectives on the map). Melee combat can be a little tricky as well. It's a little iffy if a PC will finish off a downed enemy with a quick boot, or will wiggle his arms around oddly, and getting stun locked is quite easy.\n\nThe premise is pretty interesting, being a reverse Red Dawn\Post-Apocalyptic setting after a NATO occupation of Russia, where the area outside the major cities are left without government or basic infrastructure. This quickly leads to it being every man for himself, with all the fun that implies. Scavenging for canned food and medical supplies, fighting off warlords throwing their weight around, fortifying a old Soviet style apartment block, and building up a tight knit clan!\n\nAll in all a game I enjoy the heck out of.

But it was only 10 bucks so it might've been a great gain in the mind of Booked please just don't pick it up once and let's plays,reviews. but I finally saw this gain it was on good intentions at all. But if you are going to pick this game up please be warned it's tough extremely tough. for instance if you don't play the tutorial of the gain you don't you don't get much ammo or supplies. Like food,made kits, and it doesn't give you much defense from poets yet I know you just for is as a regular civilian taking taking food taking food I think I'd don't understand Russian. So call me and we'll been misinformed. but when used start the game more like essays again to combat it gets turned a stamina base and a half factor factoring all of the stamina,health,and others but when it comes the enemy as far as I've played I've only encountered two types arranged in close combat and close combat is basically stun locking D&E can't move or defend themselves and it's really annoying. So please don't pick this game up but if this review has intrigued you to see what makes this game so bad as I claime.so go right ahead and see what makes this game so bad or good and telling which your pennies which are opinion on the game but I hope you have a better experience than what I had.To the people trying to buy it again I say good luck. but this year but questions for dynamic bullet to get from the start to get around 10+2 more so that equals to 12 and a Knife but besides that if nothing else, unless you play the tutorial.","October 5, 2014","false","3.5"," 1 of 17 people (6%) found this review helpful","6","1","17","0","0"

You play Ahmed, a former Red Army soldier, now retired just trying to eek out a living. The local army have deserted in the face of advancing NATO "peacekeepers". As a "marauder", Ahmed will be looting the local warehouses, deal with any one who gets in his way, loot any useful items (including clothing, weapons, and other items that can be useful) sell and trade items, and basically survive and perhaps, find a way to get rid of the invaders.\n\nAt its heart, Marauder is a turn-based tactical combat sim with simultaneous move phases. When not in combat, you may move about the map freely, looking for boxes to open or smash for loot inside (some locked boxes have to be forced). Enemies nearby triggers combat mode, where you plan your move, (kneel/crouch, aim this direction, hasty shot, for example) each of which takes a certain amount of time, and you only have so much in a single turn. Enemies will do the same. And if you manage to see each other, then they will shoot, and so on, based on complex combat formula such as weapon condition, relative movement, luck, and so on.\n\nThe game is EXTREMELY difficult until you understand the combat mechanics, and how to setup ambushes properly so you take minimal damage (or none) in the combat phases, as well as knowing where the loot are. I think I have died about 15-20 times just in the end of the first mission (where you, with a shotgun and maybe a pistol, encounter three army deserters with pistols)  because I kept getting flanked or not doing the ambush right. But once you do, you felt as if you accomplished something.\n\nIf you like your tactical games with a challenge, get Marauder (i.e. Man of Prey).","August 20, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
