The game was fun to play, had some intuitive controls, and had graphics that I've never seen in another MMO.\n\nHowever, it has turned into nothing but a money grab.\n\nThe devs have made absolutely abismal design choices, and have made no indication that they're going to stop. The most recent is Module 6, which was chocked full of awful surprises. It raised he level cap, but in order to get to it you were stripped of your epic/legendary gear that you JUST obtained through the last module released four months prior. On top of this, the new maps that you have to play through to get there are a massive grind, made from minimally reworked content. Endgame content was made virtually impossible, and was filled with bugs.\n\nBack to the money grab though. Basically, what it comes down to, is that this game belongs to Cryptic Studios. They've made that abundantly clear. It doesn't belong to the players a single bit. ANY purchase you make belongs to them, and they have a right to change the parameters of that purchase at any time; for instance, the bags from the cash shop that WERE bound to your account were just changed to be bound to character on equip. Considering that your character, given they have an empty bag slot, will automatically put it on when you purchase it, this basically means that the bags are now bind-to-character-on-purchase.\n\nWhy would they make such a change? What does it fix? Well, I have the answer for you: It sells their bags. Or so they think. With this "patch," they released a bag with a few more slots on the cash shop.\n\nMind you, this patch was added AFTER a new dev acknowledged all the problems with their pre-alpha-quality module, and said that he would "work hard" to "fix the problems on hand." His first action was to fix almost nothing that anyone had complaints about, and try to score Cryptic some more cash.\n\nThis game is just too wildly inconsistant. Even purchases that I've made have been changed. I purchased the Bahamut Legacy pack off of the cash shop, because it came with a title, some costume weapons (or "transmutes" as they're called), and a companion. Up until recently, these weapons were reclaimable on any character multiple times, in case you wanted to get your free weapon change at any level. This is the case no longer. If you want your weapon to have the Bahamut style, you must now spend an excess of Astral Diamonds to transmute your new weapon into your old, crappy one.\n\nCryptic is not about customer convenience. They are about THEIR convenience, and nothing else. Any and all of their "convenience" items are slowly being made as inconvenient as humanly possible, given they aren't already. I wouldn't be surprised if account-wide mounts were made to be purchased on each individual character in an upcoming patch.\n\nTL;DR, if you're going to spend your money on an MMO, don't spend it on a free one, and ESPECIALLY don't spend it on this one. I can't stress that enough. Any purchases you make will be nullified in some future patch. Go buy a subscription to WoW or something, it'll cost you less in the long run. And you can get all the mounts NWO ripped off of it for free with the full game.","April 25, 2015","false","738.6"," 1,082 of 1,174 people (92%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","92","082","1","51","40"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/QuortekCaluss/recommended/109600/","QuortekCaluss","Asherus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/QuortekCaluss/","49 products in account","Just like in any other F2P MMORPG, there has been a lot of controversy surrounding Neverwinter's Zen shop. I will try to shed some light on the current state of Neverwinter's F2P model by assuming a neutral stance. I hope this helps when you formulate some of your own opinions about this game.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThere are three immediate currency types in Neverwinter: Gold, Astral Diamonds, and Zen. Gold is obatained through normal means and buys the general necessities to play this game such as potions, basic profession items, basic mounts, and basic companions. Astral Diamonds are obtained through special tasks such as special daily quests, skirmish events, invoking your deity, and the Leadership profession. It buys a wide variety items ranging from Identify Scrolls to rare companions to mid-level gear. It is also the only currency usable in the Auction House. Zen is obtained through paying money. It buys many luxuries that helps give paying players a better experience overall. It may also be traded for Astral Diamonds and vice versa. For simplicity's sake, I will list the price of items in terms of USD instead of Zen.\n\n2. Mounts\n\nAs a non-paying player of Neverwinter, you get three tokens at level 20 for a standard 50% speed horse that lasts for 5 hours. These horses can also be bought for 5 gold which is entirely manageable. To get a faster mount, you can buy Mount Training which upgrades any horse you own to 80% for 768,000 Astral Diamonds and 110% for 2,064,000 Astral Diamonds. This is progressive so you must buy them in order.\n\nIf you decide to drop some Zen for some fancier mounts, a standard 50% mount goes for 5-8 dollars, a rare 80% mount goes for 20-30 dollars, and an epic 110% mount goes for 30-40 dollars. The more expensive mounts of their respective tier has a unique model, such as the Worg and the Howler.\n\n3. Inventory Space\n\nYou get a free bag at approximately level 10 and 30. They are 18 and 12 slots respectively. There are no craftable bags. For a free player, that means spending Astral Diamonds to buy extra inventory space. A 12 slot bag costs 6 dollars and a 24 slot bag costs 10 dollars.\n\nA player starts out with 16 bank space. An extra 16 slots of bank space can be bought for 6 dollars.\n\n4. Companions\n\nStarting at level 16, a player is rewarded a free basic companion. These companions have two skills and have a rank cap of 15. An additional companion costs 2 gold each and may be switched anytime out of combat. All companions are disabled in PvP.\n\nZen buys a couple of companions which have a completely unique aesthetic. 15 dollars nets you an animal of your choice which have a rank cap of 15. 20 dollars hires a friend which has a rank cap of 20. 30-35 dollars gets you an epic quality pet that has a rank cap of 30 and three unique skills.\n\n5. Professions\n\nIn Neverwinter, you gain Assets (workers) to do the work for you. Every profession starts you off with the most basic type of worker. You can have them do various amount of tasks on top of hiring more workers. Eventually you can combine 4 workers into an upgraded worker which allows you to tackle harder tasks. On top of these worker Assets, there are also tools Assets. These can be bought for 50s-1g each and have an 8% quality boost. Crafted items have a total of 4 slots for tools and 3 tiers for bonuses that is reached at 100% each.\n\nIn the Zen Shop, two different Profession packs exist: Professions Booster Pack and Professions Assets Pack. In the Booster Pack, there is 1 random (both quality and type) worker and random assortments of crafting items. In the Asset pack, there are 1 Purple or Blue Asset, 2 Purple Blue or Green Asset, 1 blue or green Asset and 1 green Asset (for a total of 5 guaranteed Assets). Any player may make any item, but paying customers will get an upwards of 20% stat increase on their crafted equipment.\n\n6. Character\n\nYou can make up to 2 characters. Two additional character slots may be purchased for 5 dollars. You may also rename your character for 4 dollars.\n\nRespeccing your skills costs 6 dollars. Respeccing your Feats costs Astral Diamonds determined by your current level.\n\n7. Runes\n\nIf nothing else, please read this part. This is potentially their biggest cash grab scheme and everyone should know how it works.\n\nPlayers are given the option to add additional stats/effects to their equipment in Neverwinter. These come in the forms of Runestones (pets) and Enchantments (Armor/Weapon). For pets, the Runestones are split into Offense and Defense. For Enchantments, they are split into Offense, Utility, and Defense. A single Runestone/Enchantment provides different bonuses depending on which slot there are equipped to. These also have ranks and start from 1 and ends at 9. Four of the same kind may also fuse to move up a tier. The chance of success starts at 95% at rank 1 and 10% at rank 8. You will lose a single Runestone/Enchantment upon failure.\n\nThere are two ways to circumvent failure: Preservation Ward and Coalescent Ward. Preservation Wards cost 10 cents each and prevent the loss of materials upon failure. They are also only consumed upon failure. Coalescent Wards cost 10 dollars and guarantees success of fusion. Both these wards may also be obtained on a weekly basis through Celestial Coins (the latter being rarer). Now you may be wondering why there's a huge discrepancy between the two Wards. I was wondering for a while too until I stepped my foot into endgame and found out there was an entirely different type of Enchantments: The Armor/Weapon Enchantments.\n\nArmor/Weapon Enchantments are for specific slots in your weapon/chest and grant special effects. They come in shards and have a chance to drop from Epic Dungeon bosses. You must combine 4 shards to create a Lesser version of the Enchantment. However, the success chance of fusion is at a staggeringly low 1%. To compensate, they have very strong effects. An example would be the Thunderhead Enchantment. However, the real kicker here is that these "Lesser" versions may be fused again to gain a stronger version. Those may also be fused again to create the strongest version. Ultimately, the Greater Thunderhead Enchantment will have a 30% on crit to damage and stun foes. To create the strongest Enchantment possible, it will cost 160 dollars and 64 shards. Unlike companions, these can be used in PvP.","October 23, 2014","false","87.6"," 1,646 of 1,845 people (89%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","89","646","1","42","43"

In the end, I just can't recommend it in the current state.\n\nPros -\nIf you loved the forgotten realms books, and setting for DnD you will feel like you just walked in.  They really did a great job of capturing the essence of the world.\n\nThe character leveling system is intuitive, and things are explained fairly, if briefly.\n\nThe game isn't really Pay to Win in that you can if you try hard get everything a paying player could.\n\nThe combat is fun, and diverse.  You can learn many different skills and slot the right ones for a situation, and make a build you play well.\n\nThe playerbase is amazing, at times.  No one complains about kill stealing, most people I encountered were friendly and helpful, and I never once had problems finding a group to take on a quest.  As a soloer the part I really liked, no one whined when the group immediately disbanded after the quest it formed around was completed.\n\nThe quests for getting to max level are interesting, diverse, and straightforward.  I very rarely was confused by anything laid before me, and found the game fun to play.  Until I hit max level.\n\nCons -\nThe servers lag like you wouldn't believe.  The amount of rubberbanding and failure to accept inputs is just ridiculous.  This really becomes painful in combat where the situation gets worse.  I played as a rogue, as a rogue you have very limited armor, and very good dodging ability.  A skilled player can dodge nearly any attack because of how the game shows them to you, well, you could if the game wasn't constantly lagging.  Half the time I would go through the dodge animation and take the damage anyways finding myself now out of position, and half dead because the server couldn't decide if I dodged in time, so decided I dodged, but too late.\n\nRemember that thing about 'technically not pay to win'? I'm about to take that back.  Admittedly, it is technically possible through the game to get a reasonable amount of Astral Diamonds, the currency of the player based economy, and exchange them for Zen, the currency you buy with real money.  This can be done all through the game.  The problem is they are undergoing a major AD revision trying to rebalance the economy.  This means that a new player just starting out will find getting any reasonable amount of AD together in a timely fashion nearly impossible.  Players haven't adapted to the new scarcity of AD yet, so all pricing is still way overinflated for what you get.  This problem may eventually sort itself out, but as of this review it has not.\n\nMax level is a horror show for a new player.  There's no good way to put this.  When you are leveling up from 1-70 your character 'fits' it's role.  If you're going for pure DPS you can put up some huge numbers, and work well in a team.  I've heard similar from clerics, support, and tanks.  You feel like you fit in a group right where you should.  From the time I hit level 30 I was constantly at the top of the damage charts for any given dungeon, usually #1, sometimes #2.  How it should be for a dedicated DPSer.  The second you hit 70 kiss your role goodbye.  You are now in the part of the game known as hell.  You don't have the gear to do well in any dungeon, or even any of the lvl 70 questing areas.  Some players won't want to drag you along, some will flat out insult you and leave you to rot.  You are expected to find a way, by hook or crook to get your item level up to a competitive level, and no one, and nothing in game is going to tell you how.  The game itself won't tell you item level matters, other players will.  But they can't really help you get it up, because they don't know how you can do so either.\n\nThose beautiful quests I mentioned that lead you straight up the levels until you're ready for end game content?  They run out just before you hit level 70, actually I started during a 2x experience event, and I ran out of quests at level 68.  I didn't want to put in the time to test, but I suspect without that advantage of 2x experience you might run out sooner.  It also has to be mentioned that the developers made one of the most bone-headed decisions I've ever seen.  They're trying to revamp all the end zone dungeons.  As a result, they removed all the old dungeons.  In and of itself this isn't a real problem.  It makes for less dungeons available as you grow, but you can manage.  Here's the big problem.  They left all of the quest lead-ins and references to events in place.  If you're following the quests along you will suddenly hit a 'party needed' quest that can never be completed because the zone for the quest no longer exists.  This all stems from a recent increase in the level cap.  They increased the level cap, but never changed the associated xp rewards to get you there, never changed the references to level requirements in tips, and never bothered to think of how that is going to impact new players.\n\nThe 'crafting system' or what passes for one, professions, are a joke.  It is a tiered system of hire people to do things for you.  But the catch, always a catch, you can't directly hire the best guys.  They're items, you have to find them, or buy them.  I won't comment on how easy they are to find beyond saying in the time I played I only found 1 green level, and 1 blue level worker, both for professions I wasn't currently training.  I will say buying them is god awful expensive.  So why bother?  Gear is limited in choices in this game.  The best rings you can wear, you have to craft.  There's no getting around it that I was able to discover as the items bind to the character.  Same for the highest tier armors.\n\nThat brings me to my next point.  You want to pass on that lovely sword you've been slicing kobolds with to a new character?  You want to maybe sell the old one to finance your new one?  Too bad.  You can't.  Once an item is equipped to a character it is permenantly bound to that character.  At which point you have three choices.  Equip it.  Unequip it. Sell it to a vendor for a handful of silver that is vastly less than the item is worth.  That's it.  Those are your options with anything you've ever used for even the shortest amount of time.  You can sell equipment you find, but only if you do not ever use it yourself.\n\nEverything FEELS like a cash grab.  I will not say this is intentional, I have no idea what the developers were thinking.  Everything from the way equipment works, to the way you feel underpowered the moment you hit max level, to the fact that your 'end game' healing potions heal for a fraction of your health and they sell an upgrade in the zen shop but no other way to get them.  The game feels like a cash grab.  Hell, even the servers being on their last legs, and barely able to take the strain of running the game makes it feel like they just want to make a buck and bail out quickly.\n\nI wanted to love this game.  I grew up with the forgotten realms books, I knew the setting and felt right at home.  I wanted to at least like this game.  But the truth is, this game is broken, back-loaded, and feels like an attempt to extract money from gamers.\n\nMy recommendations are as follows: If you find the setting interesting, as I did, play until you hit level 70 and quit.  Do not under any circumstances give these people money.","October 28, 2015","false","219.4"," 586 of 648 people (90%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","90","586","648","33","12"

I love the combat in the game, and it is still the standard for which I hold other MMO-type games too. The Cleric Class (my personal favorite) is probably some of the best I've seen in a game.\n\nBut it's turned into a total cashgrab game.\n\nI've stopped playing for a while now, but all the events that I took part in during the last few months I played were something that you'd have to grind for the entirety of the event to even have a hope of getting a chance at some of the end-items. Of course, if you wanted to drop some cash on it you could increase your chances.\n\nThey've got an incredbly great system in place for a lot of things, but the game got too greedy for me. Which is sad, considering how much fun I've had with it.\n\nEDIT: For izzy4020[ECDC]\nI most certainly did spend money on the game. I don't fault any game for trying to make money. It's when games try to make participating in the game cost money in a FTP game. It was getting to the point (when I stopped) that every event they had took a full weekend of grinding to get a decent prize. I can hear you say, "Oh, you aren't entitled to things! It's free to play! You should enjoy whatever you get from it!"\n\nThat's the issue. To me, it seemed like as the events grew harder to achieve, the more they started introducing "bonuses" to make the events easier. The events started having better loot once that started as well.\n\nI still ♥♥♥♥ing love the game, and want to go back to it at some point. But it got god damn greedy. I spent money on it in order to have some things made slightly easier (like traveling), but it just started to feel dirty to me. Of course, there were other things that drove me from the game (Faction Drama), but feeling like I had to pay money to participate in events was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to me.\n\nI still hold the mechanics of the game as the best MMO I've played.

I have +15 days of playtime on several characters, i own all classes at max level and  a least decently geared up, having tried several specs for most of them. I have played the hardest dungeons sucessfully since beta and mastered 3 of the many available classes (for PvE).\n\nMost reviews of this game are either very good or very bad, ill try to balance mine. If you dont feel like reading the entire review just read the end.\n\nLets start with the pros:\n\n-Its a very fun game. Combat is easy to get, but fast and still challenging, while being adictive. Endgame bosses can and will 1 shot you if you screw up.\n-The classes are very different from each others, each one has its perks, and some of them are extremely fun to play.\n-The background lore is right on WoW level.\n-There's new content like, every 6 months.\n-Foundry quests, made by users for users.\n-Leveling doesnt take too long, but its not too quick either. Its just right on spot.\n-You dont have 4 bars of abilities like in wow for example, its much simpler. You have 2 spammable At wills spells (mouse buttons), 3 Encounter skills (Q,E,R) that usually have average cooldowns, and 2 dailies that require you to fill a bar to use.  All classes have a special effect on TAB button, and you have a key (usually 5,  6 or 7 on your keyboard) to use your primary artifact. However you have many skills to slot on those few spots, so your rotation and playstyle are very customizable. For example, on my CW (Control Mage), with my rotation, i could keep 100% uptime of CC on packs of mobs if i played it perfectly, while still dealing top damage.\n-The community isnt bad at all. Ive made some good friends, as most players are older than the average gamer.\n-You can get anything in the game without paying a cent. Just get ready for the massive grind.\n\nThe Cons:\n-PvP is rly messed up. Some players went all out on P2W, and are packing the most ultimate enchants, which you will never get even close to, since 1 of them is worth more than the average player's account, and the best armor available. They'll steamroll you so hard that you wont even have time to bite the pillow. And some classes are just too strong.\n-PvE is pretty meh. The old dungeons are useless and empty due to the release of the latest +25man "raid", which consists on a zerg rush of people dealing damage. The drop chances for lower tier gear (from the older dungeons) are good, so basically you're being "forced" to do that zerg rush. Oh and i was unable to do that with my friends. Going in party wasnt working, it was random for everyone.\n-Too much currency. There are literally +50 types of currency or tokens you can use, and most of them are useless.\n-Cryptic doesnt listen to the community, and they are very incompetent. They enforce their changes even thou 95% of the people disagree with them. A dungeon was impossible to finish for like 2 weeks because the item used to enter the boss room was missing. Dunno why they didnt just disable it, instead it was running but you couldnt finish it. They usually fix something and break something else with each patch.\n-The game pulls so much out of the computer that i had to buy a new fan (mine got busted from working 24/7, and i had my graphics pretty low. I can play most games with medium or high definitions). Some players using high end machines get like 40 fps with low graphics. Too much bad coding, and on top of it, graphics arent even that good on high settings.\n-The healer role is basically disappearing. You can have your tank run a toggle skill called Knight's Valor. This allows him to take half the damage for the party, and since everyone else just stacks lifesteal....Instead, the DPS Clerics came into scene and became mainstream (in PvE and PvP) after being buffed pretty hard. LOL!\n-The Foundry. I know i listed this as a pro. But its also a con, since it demonstrates the lack of courage (or brains) of the team behind this game. They could easily give the players tools to make their own dungeons and bosses. It would set this game apart from the competition and put it on a whole new level. It would be the next level of mmo's. Instead they refused to do it, and repeatedly release new content full of grind, grind, grind until your eyes bleed.\n-The Carpal tunnel inducing mechanics and grind in this game are over 9000. Seriously.\n-The bots and exploits. There are bots everywhere. Cryptic isnt rly doing much about it, and when it does, it hurts the community.\nAnd some people exploited so hard they had hundreds of million astral diamonds (the most used in game currency), while the average player doesnt reach 200k.\nThe most known exploit is laughable as it shows how bad the people programming this game are. This happened like a year ago and its known as Caturday (happened on saturday and everyone was walking around with cat pets, which are expensive).\nIf you entered negative values while bidding on AH, you would get those many astral diamonds back. Everyone was doing it.\nI dont even have words for how amateurish this is. An intern would do better. I could do better and i havent programmed in 3 years. They rolled back the servers a day, but sincerely, the damage was done already, and not many people were banned or punished, they just kept rolling on their rich and packed accounts and ruined the economy of the game.\n\n\nIn the end, this is a game that had a fantastic potential, and could have been the "next" mmo. But it was given to people that didnt had the ability to take it there, and honestly, its getting worse each expansion, with huge lack of imagination that results in endless daily grind, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bugs that are a reflection of their inability to put their "duh" ideias into practice.\n\nIts not a bad game at all, its fun and adictive, and easy to play but hard to master; but you will struggle to reach the real items without paying; the grind is insane and getting worse; and finally, the company behind the game sucks really bad, at almost every level.\nIt wont be hard for you to find something else better to play within the genre.","April 3, 2015","false","14.3"," 412 of 472 people (87%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","87","412","472","21","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/benedictOrange/recommended/109600/","benedictOrange","[♥_ dpunk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/benedictOrange/","253 products in account","Whenever you play a MMO published by a Chinese or Korean corporation, you can expect certain aspects of the game and payment model to be different. Neverwinter is no exception. This game happens to be run by a Chinese corporation called Perfect World Entertainment. It is their "North American" division of Perfect World.\n\nThe big issues brought up by many North American and EU players is Pay2Win. Something that is rampant and very accepted and acceptable in Chinese, Korean, and SEA cultures among PC games. Neverwinter is an attempt to get away from some prevalent Pay2Win features otherwise present in their Chinese counter-parts and to a degree, has almost found an acceptable amount for NA players in their action games, such as Blacklight Retribution and Tourchlight. But these are exceptions to the rule, and these are not MMOs.\n\nNeverwinter does have Pay2Win aspects, make no mistakes. Without paying any cash, it will require a hardcore player months to be on equal footing compare to what a paying customer can achieve in a week or two if they take their time.\n\nThese aren't the things I personally have an issue with the game though. Because, with the exception of the price of coalescent wards constantly on the rise, an item required to craft high level weapon and armor enchants, most things a player can attain in a few months play, if their okay with settling for rank 7 and 8, maybe rank 9 enchants, instead of rank 10s.\n\nThe issue I have with PWE is that forum discussions about the game among players almost exclusively happens on their official forums, which are heavily censored. Not surprising coming from a corporation that formed in Beijing, outside of China's Special Economic Zone(SEZ), their quasi-capitalist zones. Even though these areas aren't officially ran as communist zones, their strongest political party remains the communist party, and many North American and EU peoples would be unable to differentiate between the two because their are so many similarities to a full on communist country.\n\n--\n\nTo get a quick idea of internet censorship in china, check out the wikipedia of Internet Censorship in China.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_People's_Republic_of_China\n\nHere is another link to a similar topic, a news.aky.com journalist story about Facebook having issues entering the Chinese scene because of internet censorship.\nhttp://news.sky.com/story/1206329/the-great-firewall-blocking-facebook-in-china\n\n--\n\nYou don't have to read those links, they are just to give you an idea about why a corporation in a different culture might have different views of what's acceptable.\n\n--\n\nDiscussions about Pay2Win, so that potential customers can decide whether they want to invest time into this game or not, are full censored on the official forums.\n\nDrop chances for dungeons are censored on the official forums, luckily these are large enough chances that they are generally well known, just don't post on the forums.\n\nDrop chances for lockboxes, which function as in-game gambling using Zen(cash) are fully censored and users can be banned from the forums for posting results of their findings. Users that have opened over a thousand lockboxes worth thousands of dollars, have been censored and banned for posting their results.\n\nPlease individuals reading this, understand that when I say gambling, I mean wagering money for the chance of something of value, in this case, in game items. I actually saw a PWE forum moderator tell somebody that whether something is considered gambling or not is only determined by a court of law instead of the definition of the word and what the large majority of people understand it to be.\n\nIt is believed among some individuals whom commonly open large amounts of lockboxes, that the chance to receive the rare item, which typically sale for between 300k-1m AD, which is equivalent to the price of 6-20 *keys, that the chance for an item fluctuates depending on a proprietary algorithm, and that a player's chance can be higher or lower depending on how long it has been since the last grouping of rare items were distributed from the boxes.\n\nOf course their is no way to know this, all we can know, is that it's over a 99.99% probability that a player has less than a 1% chance to receive $10+ item per box, which costs $1.25 to open. That it takes over $120.00 in keys purchased through PWE to average 1 of these $10+ items.\n\nOne of the excuses moderators of the PWE forums use to delete such threads, is the claim that players present the data as factual drop chances while not knowing for sure because it's a proprietary system. Not only is this not true, because the players have only presented information as data representative of a sample, but is in actuality only used as an excuse to censor the information from the players. It is PWE forum policy to censor this information, they are the most strict regarding winning from their lockboxs.\n\nIt's important to understand that this is a form of gambling that is not only unregulated, but is completely proprietary with chances and even results of other players kept secret. There is a reason this kind of secrecy isn't allowed in any gambling recognized by a regulatory body. It is for this reason it is unsurprising, that any discussion about winning rates be kept completely secret, and any discussion of Neverwinter's lockbox system being compared to gambling being a bannable offense.\n\nIt is my belief that PWE, being a branch of a Chinese corporation, doesn't understand that this kind of censorship is unacceptable to North American and EU players. It is understandable that they don't understand this, but a corporation will have no idea that it is unacceptable to their customers unless we say so. The problem is they censored us!","May 12, 2014","false","783.5"," 1,149 of 1,419 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","149","1","0","58"

The latest patch has removed nearly every feature to earn astral diamonds or currency you earn to purchase things in game or even to get Zen to buy things from the shop where people spend real moeny. Yes it used to be things many people bought with money could actually be bought with in game currency if you had enough patience. Invokes which used to give you 1,000 now only give you 250 if you are lucky. Some of the high quality gear on the exchange can cost nearly one million astral diamonds. To make matters worse many quests to earn astral diamonds have been removed. Many of the dungeons with the best equipment can not be entered until level seventy.\nWhy does that matter you ask? Well the game used to be only until level sixty. In the latest module there is much hype about the "amazing paladin" and how it will save Faerun from the Elemental Evil and how they will add ten more levels to game experience. There is just one problem existing classes already fufilled the role the paladin is supposed to play, There is a cleric, there is a tank and there is a warlock which drains health. The paladin is just a cleric in a tin suit with too much power. So how did they make this class relavant? First all methods of healing have been destroyed. Regeneration, lifesteal, potions, companions, spells from clerics ect all wrecked. Many spells that used to heal you now only give you a small chance at healing you. What does this mean? With out a highly skilled paladin in your party you will die over and over and over again. Also remember if you already played the game before Elemental Evil you worked hard to earn the best equipment for you experiecne after level sixty. This was now a waste of time since your characters will die at every turn. Everything to keep the game functional now relies on the "Oathbound Paladin" or as most call it simply "Over Powered" This healing tank in a party is the only way to do anything in the game now. Potions, clerics, self healing abilities all useless. If you try to level up to seventy now I pity the poor souls that struggle to get to that point.\nYou will hear how this balancing was put in place to strengthen tanks, encourage diverse parties and improve game play. Well if that was the goal you could also say dropping an atomic bomb on Neverwinter will improve the scenry. Frankly it is a lie and most will not realize it until the dust clears and everyone makes the grisly discovery Neverwinter has become a silent graveyard for adventurers that died everytime they turned a conner. This module has nothing to do with game play. All the other classes have been thrown off a cliff with a rock called Elemental Evil tied to their neck and left to figure out how to swim on their own. You will not be able to level up by yourself if you want, you will not be able to get anywhere in the game with out purchasing booster packs and buying Zen to get the best equipment is the only way to do anything in this game in a reasonable time. I have played this game for over a year and I am sad to say all my work and money I spent was a wasted effort.  Do not beleive the hype Neverwinter is not a free to play game in any sense of the term. It is a pay to win game that now only favors the PvP experience. If you want to do something else like level up and spend time with freinds in a party where everyone has a role. This is not the game for you. If you have more money than sense and love to smash other players while marching around as the most over powered class have at it while you can, this game will not be up for much longer with all the people leaving.","April 7, 2015","false","658.3"," 166 of 188 people (88%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","88","166","188","12","7"

So you can really become a pro without spending a dime. Im a total free player without spending any cash on this game and I got almost every end game content. [Also there's an option to convert in-game cash (Astral Diamonds) into Premium cash (Zen). So you can buy all the premium contents with a little grinding of course]\n\nCONS:\n- Premium cash (ZEN) is too expensive if you choose to spend real cash in buying it.\n-Transition of the game from last year to now is big. The game has become heavily grinding game.\n-Poor Graphics Optimizations. [Not the best looking game out there but If I can get 50+ fps in most games of current graphics demanding games @1080p High settings, why can't a medium graphically looking game like this give poor fps? gives me 40-45fps in medium settings with some settings maxed. Very Poor Performance optimization.]\n-Heavy Server Lag issues [If there are too many people in 1 instance, then it starts to rubberband like hell making it literally unplayable]\n-DLCs are crazy ♥♥♥ expensive.

Which means some players grind for hours and hours and get ♥♥♥♥ from the Quest's chest where as some people get crazy luck to win the best thing! Would have been great if the % chance of winning the best gear of the ccheat increases with each run through into same dungeon.\n-Terrifying PVP Matchmaking sometimes. It's been over an year and it's still not fixed. High Gear score players facing up against low gear scored players.

I agree that every Free2Play game has the option to spend real cash to get Premium stuffs. But there's a limit to how expensive it should get. This game crossed the line far beyond the limit..!!!\nThe game runs purely because of the famous Dungeons and Dragons Title.\n\nConclusion:\nDo I recommend it? Sure, the game is still lots of fun and it's fun to grind to some extent. It's great to play with friends.

I really do. But I just can't. I love the combat, I love the mechanics, I love the class synergy. Its all there. But I can't give it thumbs up for a multitude of reasons.\n\nThe first and primary reason I am giving this game a thumbs down is because server side latency can make this game literally unplayable at peak hours and unbearbly annoying at not peak hours. I can't even count how many times I've been fighting the boss of a dungeon and been forced to wipe because me and my entire party couldn't control our characters for 15 seconds, and when we regain control, everyone is dead and we have to start the boss over from scratch. Even when lag isn't this severe, theres always constant rubberbanding issues and unresposive abilty usage. This coupled with the fact that endgame bosses have extremely powerful attacks that must be dodged, can make for some extremly agrivating gameplay. I also can't count how many times I've been straight up kicked from the game while I was innocently running around doing daily quests. Sometimes I relog and I'm back up and running no problem, while other times I relog only to get kicked again in the next 10-15 minutes, and still other times I can't even relog even though the game says servers are up. Its annoying at best and downright aggrivating at worst. Lag is constant in this game, and makes what would be a well designed combat system aggrivating to deal with.\n\nAnother reason I have to give this game a thumbs down is the lack of endgame scaling. In order to acquire the best gear in the game, you have to run dungeons. But in order to be effective in those dungeons, you need to be properly geared. But the only way to become properly geared is by running the dungeons. Its the chicken/egg paradox. What you end up with is people who queue in for the dungeon fresh off of hitting level 70 with regular rarity trash equipment, hoping to get carried by teammates so that they can get better gear, and with enough of these people the dungeons become impossble because you and your teammates aren't properly equiped to handle mobs and bosses. And its not their fault, its Cryptics fault for not including content that scales towards endgame appropiately. Its frustrating for new level 70s, because they can't contribute to dungeons, and its frustrating for veterans because they are forced to be matched with improperly geared teammates.\n\nMy final complaint about this game is lack of endgame gear. Where is it? There is one set of gear you get from running T1 dungeons, another set from running T2 dungeons, and some PVP gear. You can also get some gear from crafting, but unless you've been playing the game for multiple months and have your crafting levels up, you're not going to be crafting anything worthwhile any time soon. And thats it. All of the gear from the campaign areas is still set at level 60, and no new gear has been added in those areas when they increased the level cap. Its garbage. The point of games like this is to personalize your character by finding the gear that fits the role you want your character to fill. But if there is only one set of gear that is viable in the endgame, then what is there? It just becomes a grind to get that set of gear, and then thats it. There is nothing else to do at that point.\n\nI love this game. I feel like it has a lot of good things going for it. I love the combat, I love the class variety, and I love the (few) dungeons that there are. But because of all the glaring flaws in the game's design, as well as the unbearable and constant server side latency that exists, I just can't in my right mind recommend this game to anyone looking for a new mmo to play.\n\nP.S. Something I feel I must mention (but didn't effect my decision in giving the game a thumbs down) is the fact that PVP in this game is awful. The pvp maps themselves are fine, and the tried and true king of the hill system works fine in this game, but the true flaw here is in matchmaking. Anyone who is level 70 will get matched with anyone else who is level 70, regardless of item level, class, pvp experience, record, anything. As best I can tell, the game just matches the first 10-20 (depeding on which pvp map you play) people in a match, randomly assigns them to teams, and lets it go. Needless to say, this does not make for any sort of competition at all, but instead becomes a battle of "which team has RNJesus blessed with the higher geared teammates". Rarely is there a PVP match that I have been placed in that was competitive. 90% of PVP matches are stomps one way or the other. This could be easily fixed by more intellegent matchmaking, but until that happens, just stay away from PVP entirely.","May 15, 2015","false","429.5"," 149 of 172 people (87%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","87","149","172","10","0"

I enjoyed the game for the first few hours when you're not subjected to the Pay2Win mechanics at every turn. You get eased into that, then can't escape it. Get ready to have your immersion completely sodomised.\n\nI wanted to like the game, really I did. I played the Neverwinter Nights games several times through, and have always been into D&D and Forgotten Realms, but if you're looking for that here, you won't find it. The developers are using the franchises for exposure, but aside from references, place names and deities who really serve no in-game purpose, the rest of it is just a bog-standard copy and paste mmo.\n\nThe game is riddled with bugs, which I can live with - it's pretty standard in mmo's as they're pretty complicated with all said and done, but Neverwinter does seem to have more than the norm.. really silly ones that shouldn't be there this long after release, but then the developers are too busy making things you can pay for. It's a plague just like Team Fortress 2 and the hats.. oh the hats...\n\nNot that the game needs to be made easier.. so far in almost 100 hours of play, I've not died once, and not for lack of trying.\nGod knows I love to push the limits of what my characters can do, and regularly Leroy my cloth and leather wearers into the frey, but enemies just aren't a challenge, and bosses are just as easy but with larger health pools.\n\nHere are some more specific points:\n\n-Level design is ok if I'm generous. There are some areas that are nice enough, but certainly not inspired, and with the dire lack of graphical optimisation, I had to have the settings so low it looks like an mmo from 8 years ago just to have it not playing like a slideshow, and it's still less than 10 fps in the capital. My comp isn't great, but I can play most games at full settings. Any nice areas that might exist are lost to the battering the settings have taken.\n\n-Quests are mini-hub based, and your standard tired fare. There are voiceovers for all of them as far as I can tell (well, in fairness I haven't paid alot of attention to it beyond the first couple of zones), which is nice, but you'll probably end up just grabbing them all and ignoring the 'story', as ultimately you're just sent off to kill a bunch of things or click on something on the ground. The quests feel like they were just dumped in to fill out the zones with something to do and aren't engaging. Grab a few, complete them, and gain a new level. The level cap is 60, and you can get to 20 in a few hours of speeding through quests without reading them.\n\n-Music I can't really comment on, I have it turned off as I use a table mic for voicechat.\n\n-Voiceovers are hit and miss for me. I've read several reviews which like them, perhaps because people tend to recognise them from other games, though personally I find that the accents aren't done too well. An example is Sergeant Knox, the main go-to guy for your level quests throughout the game. He'll start off sounding Scottish, and then kind of slip into English, then the American accent comes through before pulling it back to Scottish. Some of the voiceovers are native speakers, and they sound fine, but it breaks immersion for me when a voiceactor doesn't get it right. Having said that, there are a few noteable exceptions, and the voice acting in the Linkletter quest line was actually quite good considering the difficulty of that kind of emotiveness.\n\n-Combat is reasonably action based, with dodging and timing your abilities for best effect, so positioning can be an advantage, but you can only slot a few abilities at any given time, so you'll spend most of your time feeling like there should be more to do as you'll be restricted to spamming the few you've chosen. For skills, feats and abilities, the descriptions often lack details, so you have to spend points on the skills/abilities to see if they're any good. Those wasted points can only be reassigned by spending real money on a respec, which will cost a few quid/bucks.\n\n-Healing is a lost cause for so many reasons. If, like me, you tend to play a healing class, this is a game to avoid. Aside from making life a little easier in end-game content (of which there is a woeful lack!), there's just no need for a healer. At release the sole healing class (Divine Cleric) was fairly balanced I suppose, but got nerfed for whatever reason, and is by far the least played class. In PvP the Cleric is simply dead-weight unless the player has spent a few hundred dollars on gear. Heals are generally Heal-Over-Time (HoT), and somewhat lackluster. They're fine for PvE, but are lost to the rediculous burst damage of PvP.\n\n-PvP is enjoyable ONLY when the teams are fair. On the rare occasion that both teams consist of players who haven't really spent much or anything on overpowered gear, you can enjoy it whether you win or lose and are satisfied in a balanced match. However, most games will just be utterly dominated by those with more money than sense. It simply does not matter how well you play, or how much better you are to your opponent, if they've paid out for gear you'll be the one face-down at the end of any fight. Not fun at all. You'll be repeating that scenario over and over, so bring spare lube. The fun matches are few and far between, and there's nothing enjoyable about a rogue unstealthing and killing you from full health in less than a second, even though you saw them stealth and were ready for them. Oh, and if you're riding one of the mounts you can get for in-game currency, you can be dismounted and land on your face if you take 3 hits of damage, or lose more than 10% of your health in a hit, while riding at +50% speed.. or you can spend £40 (about $65, though I think it's cheaper on the US Zen Market) for a mount at +110% that you can't be knocked from. Ahh the joys of Pay2Win. Gear has an overall score, and you could easily be matched with other players of similar scores, but then where would the incentive be to pay for all the best gear with real money if you couldn't dominate those who can't afford it? Noo, they'll never be adding that feature.\n\nUtimately Perfect World are farming the players for every last penny they can suck out of them. You'll feel like cattle being herded into pens ready for them to milk money out of. When you step into the capital, PvP matches or higher level areas, get ready to feel like a homeless person in the rich part of town. Everywhere you look you can take in the beauty of what could be yours if only you had loads of money - and loads of money it is too. I deeply regret buying just £17 ($28) of Zen tokens and adding to the whole farce. I feel dirty and used, grasping the soiled sheets to my body to hide what little dignity I have left. You only start with 2 character slots, so I bought the Zen to get another 2 slots and have some left over for something else. Hmm, perhaps a 24 slot backpack to help with the constantly full packs that are deliberately full of enchantment stones etc to make you need more space. That'll be £10 ($16) please.\n\nAt least, I like to think they'd say please.","March 4, 2014","false","206.3"," 296 of 377 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","296","377","0","12"

The game is free and you can play for hours and hours.  The money system in the game in Gold,Silver and Copper.  Now you also have a huge bunch of items which you earn and can spend for game items.  I won't go into them all because there are just too many to list.  The real money is in Astral Diamonds which you can earn in the game.  This is where my problem lays it cost 700,000 just to upgrade a companion from a level 25 to a level 30 and you still have to level one at a time until you reach level 30 with the companion.  I can only imagine what it then cost to upgrade from level 30 to 35.  I have been playing for appox. 2 months pretty much evey day and have only been able to accumeulate roughly 125,000 Astral Diamonds so you see the problem.  My chacter is a level 60 and a level 25 companion is not really that much help on quests.  Now for the real kicker, you can purchase Astral Diamonds for real money out of your Steam Wallet and trust me you can spend hundreds of dollars.  I paid $10 for my compaion thinking I could level her up to my level, nope they hide these things from the customer.  When I purchased her I had no idea it would cost so much to level her up.\n\nThe whole game is built around getting the player to spend real money.  I can purchase a pack for DLC and it would cost me $59.99 in real money, included in this pack would be 600,000 Astral Diamonds so I could take them and add them to what I have and level up my companion to level 30 but what would be the point.\n\nNow the other big item you can use as money is a thing called Zen if you want to purchse Zen in the game 1 Zen cost roughly 365 Astral Diamonds and I need 125 Zen to purchase a key to unlock a box that the game puts in your inventory at like level 9 or so.  Do the math to see how many Astral Diamonds it would take to purchase 125 Zen so I could obtain a key to open the box.  Supposedly the box contains a vauable item and it gives you a list of what you might get.  I've had this box in my inventory for the whole game because I can't get justify spending all my Astral Diamonds to buy 125 Zen.\n\nNow at level 20 you can purchase a mount for roughly 5 gold game money.  This allows you to move around faster and hitting key pad number 6 or 7 puts you on the mount and takes you off the mount it just places it in you inventory.  You have a choise of what type of horse you would like, I won't go into all the choises.  Then comes the big kicker, if you want to go faster you have to upgrade to a 2 or 3 and again it will cost you more Astral Diamonds than you could earn in 6 months of playing. You say well why would I have to go faster, I'll tell you.  Some of the game is a fight called PVP, player verses player.  You can put yourself in a que to join a group of 4 other player and you fight with 5 other player in a kind of arena with 3 power points that change from Blue to Red depends on the team your on.  I'm not sure how it works but I'm allways on the blue team. I'm told that everyone has the same color that shows for them when they play so I don't really know how anyone would know. When I play the control points are blue and the team I'm on is blue. Now when your attacked while riding a horse your knocked off then attacked in the reg. way.  If you had an upgrade it would be more difficult for an opponant to knock you off the horse plus going faster helps you get away quicker.\nThe 3 power points I mentioned change hands in the game often and your team gets points for capturing them.  I think the first player to the power point gets the points and you also receive points by killing opponents.  So if your rushing to a power point to capture it and your not fast one of your team mates will get there first if they have a special mount or have purchased an upgrade.  Now you can buy game packs like the one I mentioned earlier for $59.00 and you get a unicorn which I assume is faster and better.  You can always tell who has spent real money in the game by what type of mount they are on, some have bears some have black panters etc etc etc.  The more money they spend the tougher they are. Armor has to be enchanted and it cost tons of Astral Diamonds to buy the enchantments.  When I started this review the enchantments were 3 times less exspensive now 7/9/2014 the enchantments will cost you 3 times what they use to.  That means that all the heavy hitters in the game that leveled out all 12 itmes in there gear when things were cheap will have a huge advantage. In combat in the PVP they always win.\n\nI could go on but I think you have the idea spend money become a better player and have a bit more fun.  Don't spend money and you can have fun and reach the highest level which is 60 but if you play matches and go up against a level 60 with special armor, weapons and mounts you will loose.  It has nothing to do with ability.\n\nIf the Developers of this game would have just sold it for $40 or $50 and let you earn all the special stuff it would have been a great game and tons of variety and fun for all.\n\nI now someone from Neverwinter will read this and send me a nasty comment telling me I'm unfair but everything I've listed it true in my opinion.  Have I had fun sure but it would be more fun if I could afford all the extras.\n\nOne big thing I forgot to mention is that on the Neverwinter log on screen there is a place to do surveys and you go to a spot called Peanutlabs and there is a list of surveys you can do. Each one tells you how much Zen you will receive for you game Neverwinter if you do the survey.  DON'T DO IT THEY DON'T PAY.  The people at Neverwinter don't care if you complain to them they send you to Peanutlabs you can look at the surveys you took each has a number and check the box "didn't receive my Zen for doing the survey" and all they do is send you an E-mail saying sometimes surveys can't be verified..What a load of crap.

It was good in terms of the core mechanics, and the actual way the gameplay flows. But then I hit endgame, and bam. Your hopes are quickly shattered. The lack of separate balancing in PvP and PvE makes it a nightmare, with flavour of the month classes dominating either one or both.\n\nMost recently in Mod 5, the TR class was overwhelmingly powerful, likewise with the CW class. However most classes were still able to get aroud it via skill and experience. And then Mod 6 came.\n\nDespite constant feedback from the players telling them that it wasn't ready for actual release from the preview forums, and an absolute litany of bugs for almost every single class, it was still released. And today, today we the players are left to deal with the crap left behind.\n\nFrom critical hits doing less damage then a regular attack in PvP, to the weakest enemies in Tier 2 dungeons being capable of 1 shotting tanks, to the absolutely ridiculous power levels of classes which we repeatedly said were too powerful. Imagine fighting a boss in any other game which was capable of becoming immune to your attacks and attempts to control it, while also being capable of killing anything in but a few hits while in that state. That's what a TR has become.\n\nImagine any game where the devs would claim balance but make one class the best at tanking, controlling, and DPS, all while other classes are left in the dirt dealing practically no damage and gutted due to bugs which have existed since its release. Does that sound balanced? If it does to you, you'll love this game. If not, then the best advice I can give you is to go play some other mmorpg, that's certainly what I plan to do.\n\nHave fun and good luck no matter what you do.\n\nP.S.

Yes it might take some time, but whats the point of playing a game if you dont want to earn some things?\n-Skill matters, what I mean by this is if you practice your class and get good at timing with your abilities etc. You can potentially out damage somone who is higher geared than you, that is if they arent as skilled as you. I like this because I'm lightweight competitive and I always want to be the highest damage dealer on the charts.\n-Leveling isn't a drag, sure some people want the leveling to be a slow process but the thing is, IT CAN! If you want to take time leveling then do that, pay attention to what NPC's say, read the story. But if you want to zoom to 60 skip everything do the quests as fast as possible and you can get it done extremely fast. I'm an altoholic so this is good for me :)\n-25 man raids will finally be coming out soon! thats right, 25 man raids!\n\n\nCons:\n-Okay there are wallet warriors.. But don't pay attention to them, if you like PVP then I don't reccomend this game for you entirely, pvp can be a mess sometimes.\n-The end game relies on you to farm. You might have to farm a dungeon 10+ times in a row to get the things you need. BUT THATS NORMAL. I've ran every dungeon in this game probably 50+ times. I love the combat in this game so i never get bored.\n-Farming the end game currency becomes a chore. But if you're a long term player then don't take it seriously. Play the game to have fun, hell dont even play the game everyday. You can collect an easy 24k of the end game currency a day and if you get that + do a few dungeons you can easy make 50k a day and be rich in 3 months. Otherwise farm hardcore and become a bawss.\n-No open world. Okay I don't have an excuse here, I really wish this had open world but hey, it doesn't have it, it never will, and if that makes you hate it then dont play.\n\nAbout the classes I've played so far:\nGreat Weapon Fighter: By far my favorite class. They are fast moving high damage dealers. They can also take a punch. I find myself constantly moving around in battle finding the best way to position myself, because in this game there is a thing called Combat Advanatage, which allows you to do more damage to an enemy if you're hitting it from the right spot. The skills on this class may not be your devestating mage skills but they are fun and fluid.\n\nControl Wizard: This class is probably one of my least favorites. I'm just terrible with this class. It does high damage but I feel like it moves really slow, I don't like it's dodge move and I really dont like the way it casts spells. Although when I am farming for enchantments I use this class to wipe mobs out really fast :P.\n\nHunter Ranger: This class is actually really fun. Moving around constantly shooting your bow while kiting enemies then when they are low health switch to your duel wielding daggers and go in for the kill. The skills on the hunter ranger are really flexible and allow you to choose to be a high damage ranger, or go more of a supportive role and do damage while boosting the damage of your allies.\n\nGaurdian Fighter: This class is pure tank. This is another class that feels really slow to me. I like to move fast "sanic". But this class is starting to become a very popular class in the endgame right now with the addition of new dungeons, and I imagine with 25 man raids coming out this will be a most wanted class. This class is mainly about buffing your allies and tanking though.\n\n\nSo this is my review and I hope you can give this game a try at least. Obviously there are alot more Pro/Con's but those are the ones I felt like mentioning. Sure this game isnt perfect, and it could use alot of work. But if you're looking for a new long term MMO then I would reccomend this. With expansions coming out every 3-5 months, and 25 main raids coming I'll be sure to stick around.\n\nAlso if you ever need some help in game or have any questions you can add me in game Jessi@dubstepghostt\n\n","October 28, 2014","true","825.6"," 125 of 171 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","125","171","6","1"

Module 6 (Ele)mental evil.\n\nChanges:\n- added lot of farming areas with no story. Just to justify levels 61-70.\n- taken quests/maps/dungeons from level 60 to 70, making them unreasonably harder.\n- with higher levels you gain LESS effect on the same stat value (example, 10% damage reduction on 60 will be 6% on 65). Because of that i was getting WEAKER wih every level up. (I didn`t want to level up, how ridiculus is that.)\n\n- They set new line about "decent" and "good" gear. Now "awesome" gear you farmed hours, days, weeks for are "meh" or "bad" now. However good you were, you are weak now.\n- New skills? Too bad most of ALL skills are broken now. Wait a month or 2 and maybe they will fix half of them.\n- PvP became ridiculus. Some healers can fight 4-8 other players in the same time.\n- As unfriendly as it can get for new players. Even old players are unfriendly to new players. Everyone hate new players until you`ll throw 10x AAA game price into game, and you will get kicked / killed / trashed / massacred / laughed at / danced on.\n\nAnd this are changes only in this module.\n\nSo, when other games add new content where you can get even stronger than before, this module made you\nWEAKER and force you to FARM or PAY to be at least as good as before and play OLD content.\nWhy the hell do i have to struggle, or farm, to be able to win in dungeon that i played already over 100 times?\nWhy the check most of my almost best equipment i could get became WEAK in a week?\n\nWhy would you want to start playing this game if you`ll know that you can become weak with every update?\nWhy would you want to pay for something that will become insignificant? Some of players lost a lot of money because of this module.\n\nJust stay away from this game, until you don`t have anything to do with big amounts of money, or hear about some big changes.","June 6, 2015","false","19.0"," 59 of 71 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","59","71","6","0"

There isn't a single fix out there for this and you'll know it's a lost cause when you take one click and freeze the whole game leaving you with no choice but to forceclose it.\n\nEven then, can this game be truly worth it? There hasn't been a single PC game that's been faithful to D&D. From Neverwinter Nights to Baldur's Gate even, it's strayed as far as it can from the core game. Even Dungeons and Dragon Online was a massive failure and also prone to pay to win/play traps and a noticeable and depressing lack of content. I can see Neverwinter falling into this considering this IS Perfect World and a company that repeatedly fails as fixing their games and instead places all their effort into making most of the content paid for, the repetitive nature of MMORPS are never worth it.\n\nDon't even waste your time downloading this.

End-game is interesting when you first reach it, but you quickly realize that you MUST buy "zen" to get the most out of this experience.  The primary barrier being that if you party up with people who have epic mounts, you will get left in the dust without purchasing one yourself.  It IS possible to acquire "zen" with the in-game Astral Diamond currency, but it will take you a LONG time to acquire enough AD to buy enough zen to purchase an account-wide epic mount.  Some mounts can be acquired solely with AD however these will be bound to your character, whereas mounts purchased with zen will be account-wide.  While this might not necessarily be much of an issue if, say, epic mounts only cost around $5 worth of zen, it is an issue because they cost more like $25 - $40 worth of zen.   As with all other PWE games I have played, this game has a severe greed problem and pay walls will keep you from getting the most out of it.  Avoid this game.  Take your $40 of epic mount money to a proper MMO.","October 19, 2014","false","799.6"," 180 of 265 people (68%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","68","180","265","6","1"

To their credit, they did manage to implement some interesting features from DnD, but they missed out on some very important ones. Such as depth. It's basically DnD 4th edition except even more watered down,  which I guess is somewhat impressive. The classes are very boring as well, you have the rogue, which unlike actual DnD rogues is bland and uninteresting. The ranger gets the ability to switch between Drizzt and Legolas which if you've ever asked anyone whose never played DnD before those are the only two types of ranger (Which can't be a coincidence). The fighter gets two classes, you can be the guy with the sword and the shield or the guy with the bigger sword and no shield, but I guess I should just be happy they've recognized there are classes of fighter other than "Guy with shield". Then we have the cleric, a pure healer class that lacks almost aany offensive capabilities, no turn undead, no evil smiting, just healing and buffs. And finally, the mage, which can't specialize in any school of magic and, due to the game's ♥♥♥♥ ability system, can only have a total of 5 different spells in their action bar (Even worse than 4e), preventing any real variety in their strategies. My favorite classes to play are the barbarians, druids, paladins, bard, and monk. Because they aren't in the game. I guess I'm not surprised because they're some of the most interesting classes, and designing them would take effort.\n\nAnyway, enough about the ♥♥♥♥-tier classes, let's move onto the combat! Basically, you hold the left mouse button to hit people, right mouse to hit people with the equivalent of a 4e at-will power, and occasionally Q, E, or R to use an ability, oh wait, "Encounter power", which you will use multiple times in a fight. Because the devs have probably never played DnD You also get daily powers that you can use by spending an action point (Doesn't do what it actually does in the tabletop by the way), represented by a blasphemous D20 shaped gauge in the middle of the UI which is filled by hitting things as well as something else which is based on your class, unless of course you're a rogue or wizard in which case you just hurt things. Because interesting game design is difficult. Also, there are about four different kinds of enemy, just with different skins slapped on them which, coupled with the fact that all the dungeon quests are the same too, means that the game is quite repetitive. There are also a lot of mechanics which are named after actual DnD mechanics that bear no resemblance to their namesake, such as the aforementioned action point. But hey, it's hard to replicate the mechanics of a game you've probably never played in the first place.\n\nOn the free to play side of things, all I want you to do is scroll up to the DLC tab and look at the pricing.\n\nTL;DR, They took 4e, stripped it down to the most boring part, and made it even shallower.\n","April 4, 2014","false","2.2"," 93 of 128 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","93","128","0","1"

If you're a newcomer, it's going to take you quite a damn while to get near max gear, I gave up on PVE in Mod 5 (about a year and a half ago?) and only kept playing just for PVP.

Try to pvp between 1-60? not with our system ! which is broken beyond repair and we dont bother to fix it, only to get new items out and get your money ! 4/5 Matches you will find at least 2-3 or even more guys, with transcendent (best enchants in the game) enchants, which will probably makes your life unbereable and most likely 1 shot you ( by most likely i mean 100%). Not to mention the mounts that give bonuses. Run into some dude with 2k Power / Crit on his mount and you're most likely going to lay down dead while he talks nonsense for you being a peasent ( yes this is that kind of game, where P2W players talk nonsene for being too overpowered and by overpowered i mean they put a lot of money in the game and get too many kills). Did i mention premade pvp teams?\n\n===PVE=== Pve is pretty good (not really, it's pretty horrible too if you have lag...) Expect from time to time enemies hitting you from far away or 1 shotting you, especially if you are running an epic dungeon when even a cockroach can give you 80k damage or even 1 shot you. PVE over 60-70 is pretty much a bunch of nonsense... Grind you way to the 70 trough hoardes of enemies that are too powerfull for you and can easily kill you. Reach lvl 70? Good now run trough an epic dungeon and i'll let you know yourself this time, what hell means.\n\n===CLASSES=== There are like 9 classes in the game or something like that. want to get really good with both PVP an PVE? Go with Trickster Rogue (TR) which can survive the impossible and deal huge amounts of damage, both to players and monsters. Annoy players in pvp like there's no tomorrow.\n\n===GRINDING=== THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT GRINDING !! Grind 1000 of hours only to get that 1 piece of equipment you can buy from the store for 10$. Daily limits, yeah...k...more pointless grinding, come back tomorrow for the same quest which gives you 1 point out of 100 to continue. come back in those 99 days to keep doing the quest until you complete to receive nothing. in general the grinding is pointless and gets boring really really quickly.\n\n===PATCHES=== From my experience so far and many hours grinding and playing this game with steam or with ARC launcher i can say that most patches are complete utter trash. A patch is not making items in the store cheaper cryptic... pls.... Sure they sometimes "try" to make something good but it just ends horrible. Breaking the game, from nerfing classes to the ground making them unplayable to making classes impossible to kill. They released a new patch? It's full of bugs? Players abusing it to get rich and then get banned ? We'll fix it after 3 months so we lose more and more players ! Jesus christ Cryptic... broken broken and more broken.\n\n===SERVERS=== Not the best but could be worst. Huge amounts of lag. If you dont have a beefy computer dont even bother. Glitchy, broken, and god knows what.\n\n===FEEDBACK & COMMUNITY=== Now i'm not so sure about the community on the forums since i dont visit it very often but i sure can tell you a lot about the community ingame. Trolls, P2W, F2P, Flamers... wait... this suddenly sounds like LOL... There are good players in the game that SOMETIMES will help you go trough dungeons, farm, grind, give you items but that's very rare. Most of the time players will laugh at you for being weak and not spending money to get gud, laugh at your expense.\nFeedback...god almighty... dont get me started.\n\n===PERFORMANCE=== My specs are on my profile, it's public so go take a look.\nPerformance is pretty horrible, hehe, not surprised eh? The game has a wide options in graphics settings and visuals but most of, even if you put them all to low you will only get 10+ fps since the servers are bad or the game bad optimised. 1 or 2 changes to the right settings can give you 7-8+ fps while the rest 1 or 2 fps bonus. The game will look like ♥♥♥♥ on low.\nIn average i get 20-30 FPS with my current specs on. Stronghold map, you will acces this map once you have a guild, i currently have around 6-15 fps on that map since it's their biggest map ever made... Make a gigantic map with a bad optimized game, not the brightest idea. On extra low settings you get like 2-3+ fps. Yeah.\n\n\n===THE COMPANY=== Money grabbing company. Biggest changes you will see is making the game worse, deleting items that you cant find in pve or pvp only on store. They dont listen to feedback and mostly care for money. They fix bugs from time to time only for players not to leave the game completely. Give this game 1-2 years it will die. And that frikin Trickster Rogue is still op, both PVE and PVP, and we've been complaining from like...forever...\n\n===IMPORTANT NOTES===\nThere are 3 currencies in the game, (4 if you count items, trading) ZEN - GOLD - ASTRAL DIAMONDS (AD)\n--ZEN = Currency you can get only from putting money in the game or exchanging Astral Diamonds. The value like any real currency floats. It can get bigger or smaller. In this game it only gets bigger which means more AD for 1 piece of ZEN.\n--GOLD = speaks for itself. COPPER - SILVER - GOLD\n--ASTRAL DIAMONDS = Astral diamonds you can only get from Dungeons,Events,Skirmishes,etc. There is an auction house which only works with ASTRAL DIAMONDS AND NOT GOLD !\n\nEnglish is not my native language so i'm sorry if i made any mistakes. You the reader will have to play for yourself and see how the game feels for you, if what i said here applies to you or not, if you feel it or not. You just have to play the game and see if you like it.

It's combat system at the time was a bit better than all the other MMO I have played, it wasn't just a stand in one place and hack away type of combat system, you had to watch what the adversary was doing and react. It had enough content to keep even the shortest attention span busy, and had a fairly well rounded grouping and dungeoneering system, with plenty of dungeons etc. As they added new powers and skills and classes they were well tested and fit in a cohesive manner, yes there were a few tweeks needed as they went live but they got on it and it worked. The refining (gem slotting) system was fairly easy and made sense and the professions (crafting) were well balanced (to an extent).\n\nThe game was always advertised as casual friendly and alt friendly and it was, you could get up and running through the first 20 lvl and tutorials with logical steps, the newbie stages were well thought out and introduced you well to the features. If the class you started wasn't a good fit for you, it was easy to start another and have an alt. it wasn't too expensive to get additional character slots beyond the initial 2 so you could try other characters on with relative ease. The community was friendly, and while it's always had a gold/AD spammer problem (AD in game currency), it was a minor annoyance. You could earn in game currency through in game activities with some effort, and with some patience and hoarding and haggling get about anything you truely needed. Then the changes came....\n\nWhat IS bad about it:\nAbout mod 5 they started obsessing more about monitization and content pushs, than bug catching. The classes introduced were unbalanced from the get go and didn't seem cohesive. When they tried to "balance" things they went at it with a meat cleaver and only made what was bad even worse, then they had to hack back on something else with the cleaver. Despite a forum with tons and tons of suggestions and pleas, they ignored it all and bulled right on through to the detriment of both the game and the player participation levels. They never have gotten any semblance of balance to PvP and the same classes always dominate, the matching system that was rudimentary at first, but worked was "improved" to make it even worse, anyone not BIS in everything need not match up in pvp, you will hate it, it's a gear fest in the worst way and 2 classes are nearly god mode in pvp.\n\nBecause of the monitization, they made some short term decisions that got people to buy more character slots, and invest in assets for crafting as a means to generate AD to keep up with the ever increasing and complicated refining system and the mod anfter mod gear obsolesence. They took the random dungeon drops (that were the whole reason to dungeon in the first place) away and put them in end chests that either were on timers or needed Zen (Store currency) to purchase keys. Rather than an insured odds of some drop, they nerfed even the chest rewards to items that were'nt salvagable or refinable. The in game "loot chests" that you needed another type of key got put on a increased rotation rate, so there was another whole set of chests in a month.\n\nDecision after decision, mod after mod they have done more to damage the game and annoy the player base. The mod 6 introduced a guild content push, locking lots of content behind forced groupingand huge material outlay to get to it (oh and of course you can pay money to get past all that material outlay....$100s and $100s of dollars). With that mod alone they effectively killed the "casual play/alt friendly" model they always pushed, the BIS stuff was all lokked way, way ebhind that guild content.\n\nThey are at mod now, and way abck in mod5 when they nerfed all the AD generation they promised to "fix" things so those that play get rewarded, they have yet to deliver, they have only added some window dressing fixs that apply to the elite 10% and the rest are left out.\n\nThey have changed the casual play to  a hit it and quit it model, unless you are the long time elite 10% you got no real reason to play, they advertise hard on the internet to bring in the new player and are trying to get the person that will make a huge money investment to get up to speed, then in 6-7 months, when they tire of spend spend spend, quit. With a new influx of new player behind them, they have did little to nothing to retain the middle ground player, and seems to have gone out of their way to antagonize them.\n\nMy recommendation:\nUnless you have wads of cash you like to spend to get to a P2W status, you are going to hate the needlessly added grind and negligable "if you play you are rewarded" they never deliver. If you are a "paper doll" type of play, like to collect suits and clothes, it has a samll alure, but better plan on investing on baggage space to hold it all (RL money btw) since there is no stable or a wardrobe system inplace. Barring wads of cash, stay away from this one, otherwise within weeks you are going to be logging on to only place set stuff and then off, not really playing.\n","February 23","false","578.1"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","39","44","0","0"

What little Neverwinter has going for it is quickly crushed under a colossal load of bugs, asinine design choices, poor level design and the monotony of grinding.\n\nPros:\n- engaging combat system (until it’s overexposed)\n- easy to play (I can haz buttonz to click 2)\n- free to play (no really it is. you can exchange game currency to the currency used in the pay shop, and getting the game currency is surprisingly easy, but does take a lot of grinding and time)\n\nCons:\n- bad to sometimes broken animations (oh yeah we’re all contortionists)\n- poor sound (sound check, look it up)\n- textures vary greatly in quality even at maximum settings (gaze into the abyss of poor textures, also makes the textures gaze into you)\n- collision (I can clip a boulder but not a tiny torch?)\n- countless of bugs and server lags (I’m st...stu...stuck)\n- dull quests (wow another kill and collect quest, and there was much rejoicing)\n- end game is based around grind, and daily quests (another way of saying “we don’t care” or “we’re not that talented,” pick your poison).\n- poor level design (running back and forth is so fun)\n- several descriptions of talents/powers/items/quests in the game are either downright wrong or lacking crucial information (here take this boppermambu it will increase your batamino with something)\n- very little variation in what monsters can do (the bandit is an ogre in disguise)\n- Surprisingly bad story in a game based around D&D, one would think they had enough source material to pick from (once upon a time ... forget it, here take 8 dragons to fight for random loot).\n\nIf you love narration, innovation, creativity and everything D&D stands for, avoid this game like the plague. If you want to laugh, as I did, of the cringe worthy bad design choices and poor executions hop on the wagon, it’s not really moving so it’s easy to catch.\n\n//----------//\n\nIf you do give it a try, which I think you should, here are some helpful macros. In the chat type:\n\n/gfxsetdefaultfov 90\n(sets the field of view to 90, in effect you zoom out, default is 55. Changing the numeric value changes the FoV).\n\n/bind f “interact”\n(This will make more sense once you try the game, but every now and then you will have trouble interacting with an object, either because the interact area is odd, or because another player is standing too close, This binds your F key to access only the object)\n\n/bind g “interactandloot”\n(This can be set in the menu, and is the standard interact option, it’s advisable to have it mapped to a key because on rare occasions you’ll need it. G was the key I mapped it to, you can obviously set it to any key).\n\n/bind h “gotocharacterselect”\n(again H was only the key I had it mapped to. Logging out and in is instant in this game if you can navigate through the menus fast enough, since every time you’re hit, the menu will close. This macro skips several menu steps and goes directly to the character select option, you still have to hit "accept" before you get hit, or take damage from a poison etc. This is useful when you want to complete a solo dungeon but is in a hurry, or tired of during the same dungeon over and over again, since you can run past all the trash mobs, log out to reset aggro, then in again to finish the boss).\n\n/hide\n(Makes you anonymous, useful to avoid pesky gold spammers, invites etc. But you can’t be invited into a party when this is on, but can still invite people into your own party, join PuG groups, and participate in encounters. You appear offline for friends)\n\n/friendsonly\n(Makes you anonymous for all but those on your friend list)\n\n/unhide\n(Removes the anonymous status, effectively ending both /hide and /friendsonly)\n\nThere are several other macros that are fun to play around with, and I encourage you to try them out, since the customize options for the interface are limited.","December 3, 2014","false","150.0"," 54 of 72 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","54","72","3","0"

Unfortunately, the bad out weigh that by far. I started the game in beta. Initially, did not like the graphics but got use to it. The lack of dedicated controller setting is also an issue. The game gets many updates/extra content which can be both bad and good.\nNow on to the bad. They add things fairly regularly. But everytime they do, have to get the better equipment. Making the older stuff useless. They also have the 'gotta have em all' mentality by adding new items and such which means in most cases you either buy extra slots somewhere to keep the old and get the new or something to that effect. Recently, they removed Astral Diamonds(AD') from the leadership crafting. Astral Diamonds are an in game currency. They dropped it because they could not figure out how to stop the bots from being on Neverwinter. Instead of working on the problem, they punish the player. Then they have the 'gold sellers'. These sites get people to break the TOS of Neverwinter. When reporting gold sellers, they say that they cannot let you know the outcome of them looking into it. Asked them what the usual punishment was told they cannot say for same reasons. If they are just account banning those people, doesn't mean crap. They get another throw away email and go back to it. They should be IP banned. The bots and/or the gold sellers ruined the in game economy ages ago. The exchange is maxed at 500AD's for 1 Zen(real cash money to buy these). The game has turned into a grindfest of all grindfests. The game has went cash grab big time.

The level cap was raised, but half of the new zones were recycled versions of previous zones, and there are zero new endgame dungeons, encounters, events, or zones.  All old items are obsolete, of course, and furthermore new tiers were added to every item type to encourage more people to use the cash shop.  There are only three dungeons to play while leveling up, where there used to be a dozen or more.  The new zones don't have traditional questing - just repeatable hourly kill quests you have to do 16 of before advancing to the next hub.

If you don't dodge out of the way in time, you'll take a big amount of damage and you're more likely to die after that.\nYour skills aren't limited to mana. Each of them are on a cooldown timer which require you to plan ahead to make some big and powerful combos.\n\nThe game currently features 6 different classes, all of which are unique and function in their own specific way. They're all interesting to play and doesn't feel bland.\n\nThe graphics are really pretty to look at. The environments are very different from area to area and they're always fun and interesting to explore.\nThe main storyline can easily be completed solo or with a few friends. There are a few optional dungeons and skirmishes along the way which require you to have a full party of 5 to be able to complete, if you don't have 4 friends available you'll be able to queue up and find other people who wants to complete the dungeon as well. But you aren't required to complete those dungeons or skirmishes if you want to progress in the main story line.\n\nIt features one of the best, if not the best, paying options of all f2p ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes out there.\nIt closely resembles the paying options of Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2. You can chose to pay for items or you can chose to play the game and use the in-game currency called "Astral Diamonds" to buy store exclusive items. Most of these store exclusive items will also be available to purchase trough other players, either by directly trading with them or trough the in-game auction house.\nNote: The only store exclusive items that provide a stat bonus are companions, and they're pretty much worthless once you get to level 60 and start doing epic dungeons. However, you'll be able to get companions by just playing, but they won't be as powerful as their store counter-part.\n\nThe devs have events about 1-2 times each month. Where you'll be able to get new items exclusive to said event or gain extra Astral Diamonds at a much faster pace than you normally would.\nThey also regularly patch the game, either with bug fixes, balances fixes or new content. On top of that, they have also released new areas pretty often. The game went out of beta less than 6 months ago and they have already released 2 completely new endgame areas, a completely new class and a major overhaul of many of the in-game features.","December 7, 2013","true","98.9"," 602 of 998 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","602","998","0","0"

Don't play it unless you're willing to spend A LOT OF REAL WORLD MONEY... A LOT! I MEAN IT! Otherwise you would need to play for too many hours to get what I call a decent character (one that doesn't make you fell obviously lagging behind others). Of course most of these hours would be filled with frustration and anger. Everything in the game is made annoyingly limited unless you pay (or play through eternity), including stash space for items, equipment, consumables, companions, mounts, etc...  You can even buy advantages for the PvP area (yes, it IS pay to win on PvP and pay for improvement on PvE). And don't you think the Starter Kit is a big deal, it's only a very small help. Besides, in my opinion, this game tries too hard to keep you playing constantly, there are "bonus time" and drops that you can get every few real hours (not gameplay hours), so to make you feel like losing items and oportunities if you're not there all day long, not to mention there are things you will lose if you don't login for a day (like gems that you gain only one each day and must accumulate at least 5 to exchange for some worthy item, meaning you must play for 5 days in a row or lose all you had accumulated).\nOther problems for me are that it's not an usual D&D RPG. Since it's an action RPG, don't expect a great story, it's OK, but nothing really compelling, and for me, it's actually slightly based on D&D, since character classes are pretty different from traditional D&D.\n\nThere are good points of course, controls are fine, graphics are fine, you don't move like a slug, setting is big and well done, fights are nice, coop is worthy and sometimes necessary, there is a foundry where users can make their own quests and make them available to everyone else (so you'll never run out of things to do).\nThe game actually got me impressed for the first few hours, but then, I began to fell like being deceited, like I needed to dedicate too much of my time and money to it. Of course you don't need to spend money if you don't want to, you can progress at a different pace and you can leave behind loot or sell very cheap the dozens of treasure boxes you don't have keys to open, but I really don't like this kind of thing, that's why I can't recommend it. For someone like me, it would be necessary to spend about US$ 200 or more to make the game enjoyable.","December 5, 2013","false","0.2"," 888 of 1,492 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","888","1","0","8"

After the installation of future mods, the point of the developers became quite clear. They made a half broken game to keep you from leaving, all so you would spend money to get accepted into epic dungeons, and PVP.\n\nI don't really have much else to say, as more recent reviews have pinned this game down as entirely accurate. For new players, they will love it, but as you will discover, once you maxed your character as far as levels go, you will be booted, for not being an elite pay to win player, or your game will crash constantly from Cryptics absolutely terrible servers, and even more horrendous patches, which just add items for you to buy, and don't fix a damn thing.\n\nAll in all, do not play this game.

It was very entertaining and there was a lot of stuff to do. Many maps and they are interesting. If I stopped playing back then my opinion would be certainly possitive. So what happened that made me change my mind? Well, after 60th level the game begins pay to win. You either buy premium objects or you end up with a character too weak to be able to do anything and constantly dying.\n\nSo after some time I decided to give you a few examples:\n- Objects can be enhanced. How do you make them better? You need special objects that can be only bought using Astral Diamonds - and they are so expensive that farming them would get extremely boring.\n- The higher the enhancement level the lower chance of succeeding. You can make it higher. To get object that allows you, you will have to buy it for real money. Eventually spend several days for a chance to win.\n- You can get a companion that will help you. But after he reaches level 20 you must upgrade him. The only way to do so is by paying. If you will not upgrade him he won't be leveling up with you and eventually he'll become useless.","June 10, 2015","false","96.7"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","23","27","0","0"

After reading online I discovered that PWE puts every user who purchases Zen through Steam into a 'probation' where they can't spend their Zen until Steam transfers the money to them.  Supposedly this is to prevent money-laundering and fraud.  Nowhere was this stated during the purchase process.  So after five days or so after I made my purchase when I went to use my Zen, I was locked out!  Call it 'buyer's remorse' if you want, but I contacted PWE support saying I didn't agree with their policy and requested a refund,  They replied saying they can't do refunds of purchases through Steam.  So I tried contacting Steam support but their support page says they can't do refunds of purchases for this game and that they generally don't do refunds for in-game purchases after 2 days.  I tried sending Steam an email anyway explaining the situation.  It's been five days since then and they've yet to contact me.  In the meantime I'm not spending my Zen so a refund can be done, but all this time I keep seeing the in-game Zen-to-AD conversion rate dropping significantly so my Zen purchase 1.5 weeks ago is now worth a lot less.\n\nThe game itself is great, but I have no desire to support a company that does this to their players and I would not recommend that anyone else does either.  If PWE doesn't trust Steam to to sell on their behalf then they simply shouldn't sell through Steam!  If I had just been warned that PWE would do this and their reason for doing it, I probably would have been fine with it.  But this whole debacle has just soured my experience of this game, and of Steam.","September 26, 2015","false","142.4"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","21","26","0","0"

Now to get to my rating it's a fun game for people that are lvl 70. With saying that I am talking about PvP in the game. They have enough AD to buy rank 7 ruins that make the game unfair to new players. They can pretty much almost one shot you.\n\nAs for the PvE content it's fun to about level 60. There are only 4 dungoens you can run till you hit 70 so not much to do there. From 1 to 60 it's a straight forward quest line to level you pretty fast beleave I hit 60 in about two weeks or three about 1 to 2 hours a day. From 60 to 70 it is a big grind fest and that's hard since you get almost no exp for killing mobs you get your exp from quest. They do have their daily quest that you can do but even with them it took about 5 hours or so just to level from 60 to 61.\n\nClasses seem kinda broken they are all OP in their own way and that really kills PvP also but a good thing for PvE since you can solo all the way to 70 if you wanted too. Treats seem to be broken or just do nothing. As a tank I maxed out my CC Res so I would get hit lease but seems like everyone I come across stuns, roots, and whatever to me no problem. Then healers and the rouge classes can dodge almost every stun I can and then I have to play cat and mouse with them and by time I catch them I am already half dead and I can't get any skills off since they keep stunning me. I also maxed out the increse to the CC I do and it still does nothing for me. It just feels like stats are broken in this game and the only thing that matters are the ruins you put into your armor.\n\nOver all it's not the worse MMORPG I've played but it's not the best. I would rather stick with the real Dungoens and Dragons MMORPG for a free to play game. As for PvP I thought SWTOR was the worse but I was wrong. I give it a 4.5/10 And the stronghold like someone else said you need to be on a real active guild unless you can't even enjoy that.","September 7, 2015","false","83.5"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

The graphics, sounds, music, and locations are well developed & quite immersive too. Cryptic Studios made an amazing free-to-play (F2P) game, and you don't have to spend any real world money to level from 1-60; The game is not restrictive in anyway whatsoever.\n\nThe character models are well detailed, and the combat movement are very engaging - albeit they could be more fluid. Combat itself is great to play, and I love that there are no auto-attack moves/spells; Everything must be done by the player in real time. In this case with regards to combat and action, you [the player] stay involved, focused, and must be have situational awareness -- something that I like very much.\n\nTo me the only downsides to this game are the ridiculously over-priced items in the Zen Market, and the difficulty in acquiring Astral Diamonds. For the latter it may not be a problem for the very active player, but casual players are at a disadvantage IMO. I also personally feel that many of the zones are very linear, and closed-in - leaving no open world exploring in what I'd like in an MMORPG.\n\nOverall the game is a must-have to play for those that enjoy Fantasy RPG's. There's very little to be disappointed with here. I highly recommend this game, especially if you're looking for something F2P.","October 6, 2014","true","146.7"," 46 of 72 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","46","72","4","0"

Some people wouldn't want a guardian in their dungeon run because of the tanking being useless to a boss enemy that will just overwhelm you with damage and aggro imediately, but would want a guardian for PVP because of the defense it has, making the person who intialy chose that class rather regretful. The mages do a lot of DPS damage which makes them a favorable class.\n\nThere are anomalies in this game that are aggrevating to see. PVE mini bosses sometimes dropped themed armor pieces that have better stats by a little but look very cool to edit, but sometimes you can get a guardians armor as a mage and this armor cannot be sold, traded, only worn and destroyed. But... you can't wear it either... so yea. The currency is limited also, where as after lvl 60, astral diamonds would become your main currency where as the coins would just be petty money to buy potions.\n\nThe end game is very small and limited and will only have you playing for about one or two weeks before realizing what you're doing everyday is farming for goals like higher gear-rank, enchantments, wealth, mounts, armor, campaigns, which honestly don't open anymore of the game to you after thats completed.","October 11, 2014","false","207.0"," 70 of 120 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","70","120","4","4"

This game has great potential, but the developer support for this game is borderline insulting.\n\nThe ranger class was meant to be in the BETA, but it wasn't until 5 months after the game's official launch date that the Ranger class was finally added. It was at least 2 months before classes got a 2nd paragon path, and as of mod 6, the most recent mod as of this review, 11 dungeons have been REMOVED leaving only 3 dungeons between lvl 20 and 69, and in my relatively short play time I found at least 2 skills that were utterly broken (They had no effect what so ever).\n\nThe vast majority of end game content is hourly quests, or grinding out "Heroic Events". They did add "Campaigns" which can take weeks to complete, but only provide a day or 2 worth of content at most. How it works is you complete a quest chain, and then start the first part of the campaign... and then wait... for 20 hours. Then you repeat this 2 more times to move on to the next stage, where you do a questline, and then wait for another 60 hours, and repeat. You also need an item which you can only get from daily quests to start each part of the campaign.\n\n","June 6, 2015","false","232.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

I didn't.\n\nAt first the "move with AWSD, click to swing the sword, etc" thing seems pretty fun and original, but it gets dull quickly, specially considering that you only have 4 powers that you can use anytime. The game aims to have a combat system similar to non-MMO RPG's but fails utterly.\n\nThe PVP system is absurd and boring: Rogues defeat any other class with almost no effort, they negate damage, avoid attacks, backstab for ridiculous damage and seem almost invulnerable at times. But PVP seems to be the weak spor for many MMORPG's nowadays so it's not a very damaging characteristic that PVP is completely broken and unplayable.\n\nI personally found the game to have too much payed content (races, mounts, etc). Again, many RPG's nowadays have the exact same problem so it's not really damaging for the game to block a lot of content from free players, but it's something you should consider before downloading the game, if you download the game at all, I mean.\n\nNext thing, the quests: they are boring and unoriginal (even the user created ones), go here, kill that, pick that. The loot is mediocre and it certainly doesn't help that most armor and weapons look exactly the same (I mean EXACTLY the same, every other player with the same class and level as you will have the same armor and the same weapons). A feeling of "Why the hell am I doing this?" hits you constantly while you play, to the point that you may find yourself not wanting to play anymore and deleting the game some days later (what happened to me). Why would I stick around in a game that feels like a chore instead of a fun activity? or the most important question: why would I stick around in a game if I have no fun while playing it?\n\nThere are definitely other F2P MMORPG's that are way better than Neverwinter out there, many, many MMORPG's.

This was my biggest dissapointment part of the point of an MMO is the community and in this game I found none.\n\nThe combat system is perhaps the best part of the game, it is active and requires the player to aim at their targets reducing the simple click and wait, however due to the above more often than not you end up doign it all solo, this is particulary tedious if like me you choose to play a healer.\n\nI checked out the cash store but never ended up buying anything as it seems to be all very overpriced I was also annoyed by the incessant advertising in character dialouge, loot drops and on the HUD.

It became quickly boring when I found out that my companions would hit a rank cap very early on that would require roughly $10 [there is a 2nd MT to get that companion to the next level of rank, no idea how much that is]. You have slots for 19 companions, BTW. Or you can buy the companions for about $20 each. Keep in mind, this is only ONE way to spend cash in this game.\n\nAlso, the lockboxes are a "rare" drop [I have about 100 of them across 4 toons, none of which have hit 30], however, the only way to open them is to buy the keys... which cost about $1 each.

Unfortunatly, module 5 brought many unwelcome changes. I have played since Module 3, (through Arc) and thouroly enjoyed it. Most of the positive reviews are prior to Module 5, so do not be fooled. Before Module 5, dungeons dropped loot to sell in the Auction House. The gap between moderate and well geared players was there, but not too prominent. The P2W factor was there, but it was rather controlled. Now... Dungeons drop currency used to buy BOP gear. Many dungeons were just completely removed from the game. Many maps are recycled. Seriouslt, 1 map is the same as another map, just upside down... Many mini dungeons are identicle top module 3 mini dungeons (with different monsters..). The new Strongholds expansion has completly destroyed the smaller guilds, as people left to join bigger guilds that could offer better Stats/boons (since when should a guild affiliation grant stat bonuses?!). The new higher level enchantments are extremely difficult and time consuming to grind for unless you pay money to buy supplies to refine them faster. The new VIP Program gives extra HP to member who pay for monthly VIP status. There are new artifact weapons every 2-4 months so the gear you do grind for is obsolete too quickly. When you refine your old artifact gear into the new sets, they only salvage about 75% of the original refinement points. Every time you buy something new in this game, it is nerfed (google teneborous enchantment). The PVP matchmaking is a disaster. I am constantly matched up against premade BIS players from the largest PVP guilds with the best boons. Solo queing into PVP will result in failure 9/10 times, as it COMPLETELY IGNORES differences in gear. This means a new lvl 70nplayer will be "thrown to the wolves" if he/she tries to pvp. I highly reccomend you stay clear of this game untill these huge issues are fixed. Definately save your money. Lvls 1-60 are decietfully fun and easy. Lvl 61 hits like a bus.

I leveled a Half-Elf ranger from level 1-40, and I can't say I recommend this game right now. In a lot of ways, NW falls short of the WoW watermark, and that's a shame, because I was hoping it would be a good successor to DDO and WoW as an MMO great.\n\nLet me say that on my SLI GTX 760s I did not experience any stutter. The game didn't even access more than 30% of these cards during play, which makes me think this could be played on a tablet if someone wanted to. Which is good if you don't have a system with great specs.\n\nSecondly, the game's visuals are only okay by 2010-2011 standards. This was released in 2013, and in 2016, it looks bad. Graphics are very flat with no shadows, no specular highlights, and no volumetric fog at all. Player meshes look like they were designed for cell phone support. Overall, visually, this is the worst MMO I've played in a great while.\n\nBut that wouldn't be a reason that I wouldn't recommend it, that comes in with the gameplay, and its annoyances start to become more apparent the longer you play and come into your class. As a ranger specializing in archery, I progressed through the game, but found myself fighting with the mechanics of the game more than the monsters. Either a mob would path behind a wall and I'd lose my shot on them, or the skill that I chose to control aggro of mobs just wasn't all that good. One of the rooting shots in the Hunter tree roots for about 1 second, even on rank 3/4...(You don't gain access to the 4th tier of abilities until level 70).\n\nBut the main reason why I won't be playing this too much longer is because of the game's broken companion AI. It's terrible. You can't set your pet to aggressive, passive, or neutral. And that makes it impossible to use the companion as a tank. On average, my companion was able to pull aggro on 2/5 of every mob set I went into. That's simply not good enough. You can't even tell the pet to attack before you shoot your bow, so you have basically no control over aggro whatsoever. With my reduced threat perk maxed, I always wound up with enemies charging at me, and running out of stamina too quickly.\n\nThere were times when I would trigger combat intentionally, wait for the companion to charge in and get some hits, then I would retreat to max bow range only to have the companion disengage for no reason and come running to me. I don't get it. This would happen in crypt-sized dungeons as well as outdoor maps.\n\nIn addition, around level 40, the game starts setting you up with obvious AMBUSH chokepoints on the map, which antagonize your abilities to no end. Hunter/Archer skills are about keeping an enemy at range, and when you have to walk onto a trigger point where 10 enemies pop in surrounding you on all sides at point blank range, it makes everything in your action bar kind of pointless.\n\nBottom line, if you're going to do this, don't play a ranged class unless you have a friend dedicated to going through the quests with you. It's pointless, and I just wasted 20 hours figuring that out. Until they fix these issues, I can't recommend Neverwinter.","March 13","false","21.7"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","4"

Has decent voice overs.\n\nGameplay: 5\nCombat similair to Tera online except you can't move while attacking, only dodge moves.  It suffers the same problem as Tera online that it's just hiding the targeting from you, but still auto targets whichever monster is closest to your cursor when you attack.  This is extremly obvious on a ranger where the split arrow move is very difficult to aim as you can't aim between enemies to hit them both, when you right click your camera auto targets one of the enemies making the attack less accurate.\nLike every other MMO, it follows the questing format that we've all grown bored of.\n\nImpression: 3\nAs an MMO it doesn't break any new ground that hasn't already been broken by Tera online.  The graphics are lower than some newer MMO's, the combat is slower, and the quests are still boring.  The game makes a vague attempt to play to neverwinter lore, but then falls appart with pre-made canned characters removing the ability to apply dungeons and dragons like upgrades.  If you were hoping to roll your own character, play Dungeons and Dragons online instead which does a much better job of letting you roll play your own character.\n\nValue: ?\nUnknown, haven't played long enough.\n\nSummary (In progress):\nI see no reason for this game to exist, the same formula has been used countless times before.  If your in this for the social aspect, play the game the rest of your friends are playing.  If your looking for D&D style roll playing, play D&D Online.  If your looking for active combat, play Tera online or Vindictus.","December 10, 2013","false","1.7"," 43 of 77 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","43","77","0","0"

Sure there are pay to win elements in the game that could easily be stamped out but that's not the most offensive part of this game.\n\nLet me tell you a story. Imagine a game called Neverwinter Online. In this fantasy world there was a beta server that a company called Cryptic set up specifically to test for bugs in upcoming patches and updates.\n\nA new class called the Hunter Ranger is scheduled to appear in the next update, but something is off about it. Every so often the stars will align and particle effects from a specific ability of the Hunter Ranger will not go away, lagging and crashing instances as particles are spewed out. Very frustrating, but Cryptic knows just what to do! It releases the Hunter Ranger and doesn't warn anyone about the known bugs and glitches with the class! For almost 3 weeks straight, instances are lagging and crashing as the players discover this bug for themselves. Finally, Cryptic decides to go ahead and patch the problem. It was then that the players found out the actual timeline of this bug.

It is simply fun. If you do not have high expectations, just wish to spend some time it is your game.\n\n\nPros:\n- Well it is fun. The quests are narrated, and have real stories. Also you can find lots of lore objects to know more about the world.\n- Looks nice.\n- Almost all of the tools / interfaces are reachable from Browser.\n- Have a minigame with dice-rolling, from browser, if you have 5-10 mins during the day. The minigame can yield in useful items. (I have not told it will be quick, as the Tier6 dungeons are really hard - like collect 18 shield from 8 dice...)\n- Have some connections with the original Neverwinter games.\n\n\nCons:\n- It is not D&D.\n- Still bugging after almost 1 year, eg: many times the daily quests cannot be completed.\n- Lagging, in dungeons the latency usually fine, but around peak hours it is (or at least feels like) more than a second, and with the dodging system, it is sometimes lethal.\n- Graphics of the game is nice, but clattering. It would really need some optimalization\n- The PvE part is fun, till lv 55 and after it became hard, and turning to a pay to win game.\n- The PVP part is still under development, some pvp is available, but the single map became boring after a while.\n- Items has variety of looks, although the same item looks the same on all of the races. At least as dwarf, I have not seen any difference from sun elf, or from humans.\n- To gather the "real" money, the astral diamond is really slow, and painful. (daily quest gives 3k - x4 as there are 4 quests, with 1-1 hour to complete-, while 300k is needed for the simplest upgrade - horse, companion, ...).\n- It may be annoys you, but the game constantly downloading in the background.\n\n\nActually the Zen / AD system (astral diamond) is confusing to be bad or good. It is the same as all Perfect World games.\n\n- You can buy Zen. It is an universal curency within PW games. If you transfer it to NW, it can be traded for AD in the exchange, or use it to buy items directly from Zen market. As the game is free to play and the servers has to be maintened, this will generate the income they are loosing with removing the monthly fee.\n- It is mentioned that everything can be collected just with play without pay. Right. To collect 1 purple artisan resource, you need 4 blue, 1 blue is 4 green, 1 green is 4 white(lv3), 1 white (lv3) is 4 white (lv2), 1 white (lv2) is 4 white (lv1), each trainings are 18 hours (offline time also counts). It is 1365 cycle x 18 hours, which is ~1000 days. At lv 60, you possibly have 5-6 slots opened already, so it is ~200 days.  And you will need 9 as you have a total 9 slots for professions. Or you can buy profession pack with a chance of green/blue/purple resource for Zen or for AD from AH (green 250k, blue 1mill, purple 4 mill AD).\n- Also myths on the internet are saying, with proper trading you can gather 300k AD / day, and there are several guides available on the internet how, but for it you have to be professional stock handler (Zen / AD exchange), or tradesman constantly monitoring the offers and needs on the AH.\n","January 12, 2014","true","127.4"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","1"

This increase was very poorly integrated, both from a chronological standpoint as well as a financial standpoint. It was released only a few months after the "Rise of Tiamat" campaign, which introduced the game's first set of Legendary "Artifact" weapons and armor.\n\nThese were made obsolete by the raise in level cap.\n\nAlso integrated were several new maps, which proved equally as useless and buggy. They were essentially re-lit versions of maps from old campaigns. Mind you, Module 6 was postponed a whole month from it's original date; for what? Exceedingly subpar, untested content.\n\nFor several months now, the developers have been growing increasingly greedy; discovering all the ways they can obtain peoples' money. Mounts, bags, respecs, rerolls, race changes, companions, a number of sneaky maneuvers that get you to believe "Oh, it's just a few dollars here and there, for convenience." They aren't convenient. They are Cryptic's. Whatever you purchase with your money is still THEIRS. They can change the parameters of what you've puchased at any time. That is to say, they can remove items from packs, change them from being bound to account to being bind on equip or bind on pickup, and not even change the item's description in doing so. And you can do nothing about it.\n\nThey fired their old dev after Mod 6's release, hired a new one, and he immediately promised to "fix the game." He hardly acknowledged many of the most prominant complaints, and in his first hotpatch made the purchasable bags "Bind on Equip" from "Bound to Account."\n\nA community moderator from their forums gave me an interesting quote to work with:\n\n"This has been said repeatedly, ad infinitum and ad nauseam: Read and abide by the Rules of Conduct. Then you won't have to worry about being moderated--and no, you don't get to interpret them to your liking.\n\nThis isn't your soapbox. This isn't your crap can. You are, in a manner of speaking, in Cryptic's house. The rules of Conduct are the house rules. You wouldn't go into someone else's house and talk a bunch of crud about their house and how they run it, and not expect to be abruptly shown the door, no? Then don't expect to be able to do it here.\n\nThere is a way to go about showing concern and dissatisfaction besides being insulting, condescending, rude, or demeaning. We don't expect everything to be sunshine and rainbows but there is a constructive and civilized way to go about it."\n\n-lewstelamon01, Community Moderator\n\nThis quote pretty much shows you how much of a catch-22 their customer support is. There are constructive ways of going about it, but what is "constructive" is purely based on their judgement alone.\n\nI have seen many a support thread shut down, by this moderator and others, because it was "unconstructive."\n\nThey weed through, delete the flack, and make sure to remove anything remotely within the parameters of their "Moderator handbook" so that the forums look clean and pretty to any new onlooker that might be seaching for an opinion on the game.\n\nHopelessly corrupt and nearing a fatal blow, is how I would describe Neverwinter Online. Don't let them see a penny of your money unless you want it to slip into the abyss.","April 30, 2014","false","128.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Ignore my hrs recorded here on Steam as I usually play via ARC and only use this to play the game when ARC is going crazy and won't let me log in. It used to have a free to play model and in some ways, it still is.  However, they  (as of this writing) have sneakily reinserted a subscription perk called a VIP program that makes it pay to win as the perks listed definitely brings a major advantage against most non-subs.\n\nAlso, as of this writing, there's some tomfoolery going on during high level dungeons crawls on pugs that gets you kicked out via teammates that want the loot for themselves or for their friends that weren't even in the group.  I started playing around February of 2015 and got almost all of my toons of every class and race not hidden behind a pay wall to max level, but the grind for gear on dungeons for the newly max level character almost stops due to other players kicking you out of the group for the abovementioned reason in regards to loot.   After experiencing it more than once soured my overall experience of the game.\n\nPros: fun levelling, impressive graphics, some of the quests are downright hilarious in terms of story/spoken dialogue.\n\nCons: See my rant above.\n\nConclusion:  If you can stand the cons, then you'll enjoy the game.

It actually makes you wait 24 hours before you can do another. With the sheer amount of end game content itsw not worth it. I figured out that it would take more than a year to actually beat it, and by then they would have already come out with even more end game content for you to wait on. Then again you could spendd hundreds of dollars just so that you can beat it. Yeah this game is a p2w, dont believe anyone that says its not. You have to pay for everything, mounts, gear, in game money, and even for your own guild you have to pay. I spent only 5 dollars in it and that was to get some in game cash and I didnt get ♥♥♥♥ for it, all I got was a common mount that anyone else could get.

Each role has it's own abilities. Depending on what skills you use later on, you can fulfill multiple purposes in each role.\nThe game is quite interesting on start and it's fun to try out new abilities as you level up and get your first horse or companion. At least on start you get the impression of following some sort of storyline, doing several different things. After a while it gets very repetitive since quests quickly change to a pure seek and destroy.\nFinishing the first "plot", you will be sent to the capital city to a certain officer that offers new quests which allow you to visit other places.\nMost places are fairly nice to look at (depending on your settings) and the level design is pretty interesting in several cases. You get to fight a variety of enemies, a few of which have specilized abilities as you progress into higher levels.\n\nSecond point would be fighting and the skilling tree:\nFighting requires some concentration as strong enemie's attacks are displayed on the ground as a warning. These warnings and some slow mob's attacks are supposed to be dodged by running away or staying out of range.\nThe skill tree offers a variety of different spells and abilities. These are divided into:\n-"daily powers", which supposed to be strong spells and need action points to be filled up, likely through fighting.\n-"free powers", which are started using the left and right mouse button and can be seen as a variety of basic attacking techniques.\n-(red powers?) ...are what you would call a spell. Cooldowns, damage values and/or custom effects.\n\nIn addition, you get a variety of so-called "talents" that start with basic ones and advance into specialized talents that would power certains aspects of your normal abilities.\nExperimenting with these to find your own playstyle is interesting.\n\nSo much for the major gameplay. Now off to the (many) points why I wouldn't recommend playing this game at it's current stage:\n\nMy main point would be the lack of originality and heartblood.\nEverything you get to do has already been there many many times in countless other MMORPGs. After a nice start, the game quickly breaks down into loveless quest design and the further you go, the more confused you get.\nA constant flood of items without any sort of explanation about the point to it fills the inventory. Every time you figured out what to do with one of those strange new coins you found, the game is telling you to collect another 2 kinds of coins. The sheer amount of different "currencies" is nuts, while the majority of these will be outdated by the time you figured out what they are for.\nHuge areas with different questing points of any kind of importance spread all over make it very hard if not impossible to orientate on which plot you are actually working right now and where you may want to get something special from.\n\nThe progress after the first levels is very quickly nullified and the game wants you to spend many hours on tiny steps forward. If you want to use the things you find, you are supposed to collect immense amounts of points in certain "currencies" the further your level progresses. The game very quickly yells at you "BUY OUR STUFF OR YOU WON'T GET ANYWHERE".\nIt may be free to play, but it's very close to "pay to progress".\n\nAs soon as you get to fight in a group, you quickly lose track of what's going on. Insane amounts of special effects from the players, their companions and the minions often make it a lag fest where you see nothing anymore and steer on your cooldowns to use the next spell on the "blazing-green-red-white-yellow-blue" part of your screen where you saw a dragon a few minutes ago, hoping he's still there.\n\nGoing over to the serverside:\nTerrible server performance and countless bugs make playing a mess quite often. Constantly brought out new content keeps flooding the already messed up system. Reported bugs do not seem to be worked on in time - if at all.\n\n\nSince the content of this game is too huge to break down most things, I tried to keep it at a minimum. There are many more things I didn't like about this game. Unless there are major changes (keyword is major), I cannot recommend playing this game.","April 17, 2015","false","102.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Once you reach 60, it takes forever to lvl up and you are motivated by epic dungeons, which become available at lv 70. At lvl 70 the game goes from being free to play to free to lose. If you do not spend real money it is almost impossible to get decent gear or be able to afford to upgrade gear. You have a limit of about 36k rough AD you can refine per day, so that is your limit on income you can earn without paying. You can earn AD through other means, such as exploiting the constantly buggy auction house, or selling the items you get from dungeons, this still pays very low and consumes tons of time. If you do decide to play the game and put up with all the bugs, it is helpful to get VIP, which at the moment costs about 495k AD using the AD exchange. This will take a lot of time if you do not use real money, but it gives you and enchantment key and after having it for two months, I pretty much make the money I paid for it back, but haven't made more. Do not buy enchantment keys, they are a rip off and you will lose a lot of AD most of the time. It is a lot about luck, it is possible to buy 20 keys and get a legendary item, but most likely you will open 20 boxes and all average items and a few epics that still do not make up for the price of the keys. I have opened over a 100 boxes and have never gotten a legendary item. I have heard of people who have played for 8 months with VIP and got one, so it can happen. Just be aware it is very unlikely. I would recommend not spending any money on this game because the exchange rate is horrible and it is not a good game to invest in. It gets old and boring very fast once you understand how long it will take you to earn enough for good items.

I do not ever see a thief in the real game, so the players just make one soley for pvp.\nThe classses are not like the D&D game system at all.  The cleric can not turn undead, all they do is heal, they can not do any damage and use a magic missle type attack.  The ranger class is very weak, you should only use the basic powers you start with as higher level powers actually do less damage then these as you level up.  The wizard controls people and can "freeze" enemies which does not work all that well since anything bigger then a minion is immune.  The other 2 are fighters, one tank and one high dps warrior.\nEverything takes astral diamonds, or real money called zen, everything.\nYou pick up an item and need to identify it, it costs a scroll you pay for with astral diamonds.\nYou want good equipment, a mount, a companion it all comes out of the astral diamonds.\nGuess what, they are hard to earn!!!\nAt the beginning levels you can do 1 skirmish for 1000 astral diamonds and if you do it during the hour of the day that features skirmishes you get an extra 1000 for a total of 2000 for that 15 minutes, assuming that there are enough people on at your level and on your map to get into the queue.  You can also do dungeons daily to get 3000 astral diamonds but some of them take 90 minutes or longer depending on who you have on your team.\nGuess what, you want that good gear, it will run you 300000 or more astral diamonds, per piece, you do the math here.\nOf course you can always swipe your credit card and get 1 million or more astral diamonds, I mean they even have an option for you to spend $200 real dollars all at one time to make it easy for you to play their game.\n\nI did pick yes to recommend this game.\nIt is fun to play, to try out the 5 classes and run some missions.\nYou will get to your own point of saying, that is enough.  After your 3rd time in a row of being killed by someone who spent $200 for their pvp gear or maybe after spending more astral diamonds on identify scrolls running through a dungeon then you actually make.\nThat point will be up to you.\n\nSo hop in here, please, so that I do not have to wait 30 minutes in each queue to play something.  :)\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nOkay this is edited after module 3 came out, the icewind dale.  At this time I have put in another 50 or so hours trying out the changes to the new hunter paragon path and the new module.\n\nWhen I first looked at this game I read the first review on the forum.  It had a guy who had spent over 900 hours on the game and did not recommend it.  I thought that was kind of stupid, who would spend that long on a game and not recommend it.  SO HERE I AM RAISING MY HAND AS WELL.\n\nI am changing my game recommendation from yes to try it out to NO just stay far far far far away.\n\nThe price of 1 piece of real Zen, real money is now maxed out again at 500 astral diamonds.\nPay attention, you will earn 1000 astral diamonds for every 15 minute skirmish you run.  So that means if you spend 15 minutes playing a skirmish match and trade in your astral diamonds you will get 2 real zen.  Now take a look at the Zen store, you want that nice cheetah mount, it will run you\n3, 500 Zen.\n\nThere are players in the game who have multiple accounts, multiple meaning up to 50, who just run bots on all of them to farm astral diamonds.  I now see why they do that.\n\nThere really is no fun way to get astral diamonds.  You can rerun the same skirmishes daily, assuming it is the skirmishes hour and make 1,000 astral diamonds per one, remember the longer ones will take you 15 minutes each or longer.  You can do the daily dungeons for 3000 astral diamonds, remember they will take you up to 90 minutes to do that.\n\nOkay so the new area, whoa what a bummer.\nFirst you need to be level 60, current game max.\nThen you need to have epic level gear so that your gear score is over 10000.\nThen you need to have level 3 boons unlocked from either one of the grinding campaigns at the end.\nSo basically, only those players who have done everything they possibly can and are still playing.\n\nThen there is the new PVP part, since the game was so unbalanced to start with, they now will reward those players with even more power after spending $300 real dollars or more on PVP gear.\n\nAt the time I am writing this I have 4, yes 4, different lock boxes sets stacking up in my inventory.\nThese are boxes where you have a very tiny chance to get good gear, or a new mount or a companion and they all take Zen, real money, keys to open.\n\nSo I have tried every single class, both paragon paths for each, I have beat the game, max level on all of them.  I have written a ton of helpful hints for new players and now done a review twice.\n\nI wish I had all that play time back now!!!!\n\nIt just gets worse and worse as Cryptic nickel and dimes you to death at the end.","May 4, 2014","false","323.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It says on Steam that I only have about 70 hours played, but that's because I used to play it on the Cryptic launcher instead of Steam. I've played a lot more than that.\n\nBut lately, they've stopped producing content for people who can't or won't pay for things. I'm all for having items and even certain questlines be pay to play, but whole classes and races? The new and ridiculous "events" are annoying and useless. They get in the way of actual gameplay! I'm trying to kill this boss, and a "you just got a -insert stupid name for item necessary for event-! Here's a large popup box and a new quest!" And suddenly I have to rush to click out before the boss smashes my unresponsive avatar into a pulp.\n\nThe game is super unbalanced, too. Want a tip for how to breeze through early levels? Pick Hunter or Cleric, the two most OP classes. Mage is also pretty good- the ability to eliminate your enemies ability to move or attack is pretty OP. Less awesome damage, though. The game is never hard unless you go somewhere above your level. The monsters are nerfed to hell and back.\n\nThere's also no variety. I used to love the dungeon crawls, but after the first thirty or so, their novelty wore off. And they are no longer worth the cliche grinding of "kill 20 imps" to get to. Every world, every quest, every single thing is exactly the same throughout the entire game! "Walk through absently designed dungeon. Interact with switches. Kill monsters. Kill boss. Done."\n\nThis game hints at awesome customization with the character creation and the class/race quests and objects you can get to open more parts of the game. But none of these are expanded on in any useful way. They're token efforts to make players feel better. The only one I came across that had any kind of interesting class/race quest was Scourge Warlock! For all I know, Dragonborn or Moon Elf might have it better. But I wouldn't know, because they're behind a paywall!\n\nHonestly, the cashgrab aspect is probably losing them more money than they're making. If players are leaving because the game sucks without money being added in, make it a pay to play and move on. Plenty of games make plenty of money on that system. But if you don't have players to buy things, no one buys things. I would happily buy some of the beautiful companions and mounts and costumes if I had the money available. I would gladly buy the weapons and other cool things. But I refuse to be fleeced for the ability to play all of the actual game parts of the game! A free to play game should have the ability to buy extras. Not the ability to buy mroe of the game.","August 2, 2015","false","71.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Your wallet (and sanity) will thank me later.\n\nMany MMORPGs fail to consider their new blood, but this is easily one of the most egregious offenders you can find on Steam as a whole. It's a blight on gaming in general, an abject lesson in taking a once-great title and driving it straight into the ground over money. There's no balance of time versus money. You will pay up on this one, or you won't be competitive.\n\nThe PvE content is only truly fun up till 60 (when they introduce the horrible Mod 6 content -- and it just gets worse from there on in terms of agonisingly boring grinding), and PvP is for masochists only. Mobs will regularly one or two shot you in epic dungeons, and established players are invincible in the battlegrounds... assuming you can find a PvP match at all, with the game's lengthy queues.

My initial impression was good. A Free to Play that seemed to allow players to advance without spending real money, albeit  a bit slower than paying players, is acceptable. The combat system is not quite what I was expecting from a D&D title (cooldown based abilities all around), but it is still a LOT of fun. Very easy, quick controls that respond well, as long as the server is not lagging (which, unfortunately, happens a LOT). But I still played it, and had a lot of fun doing so. I spent a little money on it, just so I could open some of those lockboxes, and I did manage to get an epic sword and cloak out of them.\n\nThis was a couple of years ago, though, before the changes that recently hit. Since then, they have taken this game from a Free-to-Play to an all out money grab. It has gone from Free-to-Play, to Pay-to-Win.\n\n-AD rewards have been nerfed. No way to acquire the currency needed to buy things from the auction house unless you buy something from the Zen market first.\n-The zone dungeons are broken (literally removed from the game, for reasons I will speculate on later).\n-We now have at least 3 types of those infernal, blasted, annoying, inventory-slot-robbing lockboxes that can only be opened with a key that can only be acquired through the Zen market. I have only seen 3 types; there are likely more, and they drop CONSTANTLY. You WILL get them, even when you don't want them. There are constant system messages pasting across the screen, stating things like,"So-and-so just got an epic whats-it-ma-thingy-with-flames-flying-from-its-rump from a Rusted, drops-all-the-time, yet somehow still shows EPIC rarity lockbox of money grabbing."\n-Loot drops, which were never all that great, are now an abysmal joke. I consistently see the same 2 or 3 pieces of armor dropping in every single zone.\n-Quest rewards are a waste, if not an outright insult. Remember when I said the dungeons were removed? Yeah, those used to be the only source of decent gear in the game that didn't require you to open your wallet. They're gone now, but the devs left the quest links and markers in place.\n\nI saw all these changes, and I decided to conduct an experiment. I bought $50.00 worth of Zen and bought as many keys as I could. I think I ended up with thirty of them, making each one cost about $1.60. I had some Zen left over, but not enough to buy anything without coughing up more real money (seriously, do ALL of these games have pricing schemes that make it impossible to take your "currency" balance to zero?). Anyway, I opened 30 of those damnable lock boxes, and got CRAP. A handful of epic enchantments. A couple of blue craftsmen. Oh, and a 5th character slot for buying stuff on the Zen market. 50 bucks got me NOTHING worth mentioning. No epic gear, like it was in the early days. No new mounts. Just a bunch of enchantments, runestones, and a modest amount of astral diamonds.\n\nPathetic.\n\nI could go on, but I won't. I'll just say that this game was, when it launched, much less greedy. Players who spent a few bucks would be rewarded with epic gear that levelled with their character, or a cool mount. Not any more. Neverwinter is now such an obvious wallet leech that the very first screen it gives you upon logging in is the Zen market. Draw your own conclusions from that.\n","January 20","false","46.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But I guess there was something I was overlooking when I first played it as well that basically is the worst thing ever.\n\nThis game is a cash grab. Just look at the price of the DLCs and that says enough. See all those people running around on cool mounts? Gotta buy em, otherwise your stuck with a plain Jane horse. Companions? Money. Crafting? Money, Items? Money. Dungeons? Money. Money Money Money. Everything in this game has a price tag and while the in game prices aren't too bad, that's where they hook you. ♥♥♥♥ is cheap and odds are you'll get "Something" of use out of each random bag you buy meaning you'll keep spending gobs of money. Really though it's not a problem if you're not stupid.\n\nI spent upwards of $45 on the game with in game purchases and played the game for about 4 months, so I'd say I got my  money's worth out of the game. It was interesting for sure, but endgame content was non-existent at the time.\n\nThe quest immersion is great, with actual things happening in the quests, plus the toolset to build your own quests makes this game pretty good.\n\nClasses are bland and generic, but then, what do you expect from Dungeons and Dragons. They've never really been the most creative when it came class variety or uniqueness. Likewise with the race selections. Class mechanics are fun and interesting but lose their flair quickly.\n\nDungeons are brutal in length and boast a pretty hogwash set of mechanics for any fight. Just pick one boss from any level dungeon and they either suck to fight against because the mechanics are annoying, or the mechanics are so bad that the boss is broken or too easy.\n\nLeveling up from min to max takes almost a month of casual play to attain, less if you're hardcore, so that's not bad.\n\nSave your money when playing this game as it doesn't offer much once you hit max level and most of the things they offer for you to buy are cosmetic in nature or offer only slight boosts to your character.\n\nYou can pretty much skip over this game and not miss out on anything.","April 9, 2015","false","121.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

We got to like the second area or something and the whole place was just groups of the same 5 orcs over and over, with the occasional ogre.

In lieu of a glorious celebration of problem solving, fierce combat, and character interactions, we're given a series of adventures so generic that it brings up comparisons to decades prior.  Game mechanics similarly suffer a compromise between core dungeons and dragons concepts from fourth edition, and traditional MMO fair.  While it isn't necessarily terrible, especially for a free game, it doesn't warrant our attention either, and I'm stuck wondering who it appeals to.\n\nForgotten Realms beckons adventures to sally forth to the wonderful locales such as Neverwinter, Icewind Dale, and other notable cities to defeat the evil Lich Queen Valindra as she does what all evil characters do; bring about death and destruction.  Story wise, it's so by the numbers that about an hour into it I was just clicking to get my quests.  The game throws so many tropes at you that it defies belief; a person you just met dying while trying to ingratiate himself to you, a fetch quest belaying the importance of resources to soldiers, and so forth.  There was even a quest to save three privates from becoming zombies, and after it was finished I wasn't allowed to save any more, dredging up memories of the infamous dickwolves strip of penny arcade.  These things aren't necessarily bad, as tropes can be used very effectively, but these are just sloppy.\n\nContinuing in much the same fashion, we're told that opportunists are wreaking havok on the land of Neverwinter, and we're tasked with helping out.  Only, I really didn't want to, because most of the people we're saving are ♥♥♥♥♥.  I understand that conceptually, a MMO demands effort on the behalf of a player to reach rewards like enough money to buy weapons and armor.  When a city is in direct peril, and the fate of shopkeepers ultimately depends on me killing five zombies or collecting three leafs, fleecing me an arm and a leg to get a shield that will increase my odds of survival, or treating me like an a-hole isn't really motivation enough to get on my high horse to defeat the arch bad guy, or save the crown jewel from Nashkel, or even delivering a message to Sargent Whatshisname.\n\nClearly, it doesn't take any chances on bucking the formula with the narrative, and largely it plays it safe with the game play as well.  After playing for a couple of hours, I can see that the team took ques from fourth edition, but the concepts don't really apply to an MMO.  Having encounters, daily's, and at wills stressed cooperation with your team and planning for the next encounter in the pen and paper version.  Here it means waiting a bit to mash e or q.  A cheap cop out for an MMO, timing is only a small part of it.  Your life is now preposterously high to compensate for a lack of a traditional AC system.  There aren't many choices to customize your character beyond putting points in different powers to level them up.  Purchasable/findable kits allow players to bypass certain skill blocks like thievery or dungeoneering, and all for the sake of looting, nothing more.  Essentially, it negates the importance of player choice, and emphasizes purchase power.\n\nPerfectly exemplifying the translation from pen and paper to MMO would be the previous Dungeons and Dragons Online.  Where it succeeds, and likewise Neverwinter fails, is letting the player define their character in so many ways.  Not just in play style or character creation, but also letting the character choose how they interact with the NPC's, solve quests, and align themselves with the different factions.  The questing itself was extremely varied, and conjured amazing stories, like a drinking contest with beholders, or a carnival of the undead.  It was an amazing triumph that empowered the player to adventure and discover, not just run between quest giver and questing zone.  Here, there is very little the player has an affect on, which makes it feel soulless.\n\nI've spent little time with Neverwinter, so I can only hope that it improves beyond the initial image it conveys.  Reading more about the game though, I'm struck with my impression of tedium and depression.  We've all been “the chosen one” who can destroy the great evil and bring peace to the land, but rarely are we impressed enough to continue that adventure to its climax.  Neverwinter is an adventure for a different kind of player, and sadly it isn't the one Dungeons and Dragons traditionally appeals to.  If you're looking for an MMO fix, you can do far worse, and it isn't necessarily a terrible game in its own right.  It is uninspired, and in a market with far better choices, I can't justify spending any more time in the Forgotten Realms.","May 26, 2014","false","2.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johhota/recommended/109600/","johhota","Joh Hota","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johhota/","72 products in account","This game is not terrible, but it's not very good either. I love Cryptic games, especially the engine in which these games run. Both Champions Online and Star Trek Online are controller compatible. Why was that feature removed from Neverwinter I'll never understand. But let's ignore that for a second, I'm not a D&D fan so the lack of accurate lore other people complain about doesn't affect this review, I'm going to base it off gameplay, fun factor and economy.\n\nLet's start with gampley, this is a hybrid action MMO. You can move around and even avoid some attacks by moving but when you attack you're locked in place. Once you get used to that then the gameplay shouldn't be a problem. Except when we go and look at your efficiency in battle. Your level ups grant you attribute points to make the build that best fit your style, OK that's normal. But then we have gear and that's when things get out of control. You have a variety of ways to get the right gear for your build:\n\n1. Be on an efficient and active Guild willing to baby sit you while you farm it (good luck with that )\n2. Farm the currency you need to convert into gear. (I'll talk about the economy in a bit)\n3. Buy the currency to get the top gear (better known as Pay 2 Win)\n\nWhich brings us to the economy\n\nAstral Diamonds is the top currency. You use it for almost EVERYTHING and you have a daily cap (to refine it) of 24,000 (if I'm not mistaken) Want to level up your mount? OK that's a couple of million astrals per level. Want to level your companion, Another couple of million of astrals. Plenty of things you want to buy you need astrals for, and even to transmute some gear. The entire auction house uses astrals as currency, so that armor that some dude was lucky enough to land on a dungeon run, well you may have to pay close to a million 'cause people aren't selling things for cheap. So that's farming Astral Events (skirmish) which take anything from 5-30 minutes (depending on the team and your level) for 1,000AD each run, Doing daily missions (which can take a very long time as some involve running the same instance multiple times in a row to complete and pretty sure the best one pays only 8,000 AD and that's unlocked at lvl 60) So basically you'll spent most of the day, every day trying to hit the refinement cap so you can get enough astrals to buy ONE piece of gear you want. Yes you can sell your stuff for astrals and those are already refined, but that means you'll have to spend hours farming good enough stuff to sell and hope to god someone has the "money" to buy it. Even worse if you want to level your companions, it's just not humanly possible and that's where the game falls apart. It's filled with these gold farmer things, you'll get bombarded through mail about them. It's gotten to the point where they not only have become the only viable option to play this game but that they have gone out of their way to destroy the exchange.\n\nYou may be asking, what is the exchange? well Perfect World games use a virtual currency known as zen that you can only (mostly as you can do surveys and crap) obtain with real money to buy extra content on their individual stores. The exchange was created so that people with less income, but more free time, could play for astrals so that those with jobs (aka more money and less time to play) could still progress at the same rate by buying those astrals from players. That's a meta game on its own as you can play the market, buy when low and sell when high. The fluctuation usually caused by sales which PW was very keen in having them weekly. That way people would always want zen don't they? That's a bit troublesome but understandable, it is a business. But the problem in this situation is that most players don't like to think, thinking is forbidden in neverwinter, you can't be rational. Players are impulsive, which makes the job of gold farmers a hell of a lot easier. they managed to break the exchange hitting the cap of the most useful currency. What I mean by that is, 1 zen which is the equivalent of 1 cent, can get you (at the moment of this review) 500 astrals. So let's say you want to throw $20 worth of zen at the exchange, you come out with 10 million astrals. So all that effort farming that currency shows nothing for it. It is the currency that gets the game going but ultimately, the players have lowered its value to a point of no return. PW isn't doing its job protecting the game from farmers either, but again I understand it, ultimately they get a piece of the pie. A reduced piece if they throw some numbers, the ones getting the big bucks are the Gold Farming sites/services.\n\nHow much do you need good armor? A LOT. Level basically means nothing, it's pretty much all in the gear, that's what make you a badass. I can't recommend this game, even with the Foundry which is a really good but gimped system that let's you create your own adventures. (gimped part, you can't have access to all the armor assets when creating NPCs) It's been over a year since I started playing and never felt like uninstalling the game, until now.","June 20, 2014","false","151.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The game doesn't appear to be very deep regarding NwN/D&D lore, so if that's what you're looking for I'd think purchasing a copy of Neverwinter Nights or Neverwinter Nights 2 a good idea and seeking out a player run persistent server.\n\nIf you're looking for a game with a good combat engine, and some pretty fun multiplayer (with friends) then i can see this game being a good fit, especially considering The Foundry and the idea of playing player made content (which i have yet to experience but read its quite good). On the other hand it does seem to be buggy and laggy in high populated areas, and if you're into MMO PvP, stay away.  Just looking at whats in the in-game-store, its quite obvious this game is pay to win.\n\nThere is also some weird issue with censorship on the Perfect World forums (Chinese policed internet?).\n\nAll in all, id only recommend if you have some friends to group with, and are not looking for anything to deep or involving.","July 21, 2014","false","0.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","3"

It's fun for awhile but, IMO, the trick to making money in a F2P model is to not constantly force it in the player's face. I wouldn't say it's pay-to-win, and you could enjoy the game without spending a dime if you are ok with three big negatives. 1.) It's not D&D; 2.) It's nowhere close to being an expansion of the Forgotten Realms games; 3.) You will constantly be reminded that you can spend real money. That said, I did enjoy the dungeon-building. (I didn't build one, but I enjoyed playing others' campaigns.) It's worth playing around with for awhile but the revenue model takes away from a lot of the fun.\n\n*** EDIT\n\nI agree with Random Gamer in that Neverwinter is not P2W. This is a case where I really wish that Steam offered a continuum rather than a binary Yes/No range of recommendation options. Of my three complaints, the only one that drove the thumbs-down was the amount of in-game promotion of, even if not necessarily the case, what appeared to be "driving one to a cash shop".\n\nThat said, I admit that this sentiment is based on my experiences immediately into launch. Developers adapt and adopt different strategies for generating the income that they justifiably need and deserve; therefore, my complaint may not be as valid as it was at game launch.\n\nA good example of a game that, imo, started out with an excellent model for generating income is GW2. ANet's philosophy was that people would spend if they enjoyed the game....that advertising should be bottom priority way below content. Of course, in that case, one purchases the game...but that isn't going to pay for their ambition to evolve a living world (i.e., monthly new content). While there is a bit more in-game advertising than I think ANet originally planned, I think that their model has been successful in that a rather solid and loyal playerbase continues to puchase novelties and skins that do little, if anything at all, to make the player "better".\n\nI plan to spend a bit more time in NeverWinter. As said in the OP, I do recommend trying out the game. It's just a pet-peeve of mine (automatic deal-breaker) to have immersion interrupted by marketing. I prefer it when the game promotes services, perks, pets, etc. via the log-in screen, the game's website, and/or e-mail newsletters. Of course, this is also coming from someone who prefers having subscriptions as an option (e.g., EQ2's model).","May 11, 2014","false","4.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

It wasn't surprising, considering it was based on Forgotten Realms.\n- But it also had -still has- a very active combat system, unless like a lot of MMOs with static ones.\n- Leveling up was pretty fun, too. "Not grinding" was the main reason for this, you always changed maps and quests and moved forward. It was very fun.\nThese three properties made Neverwinter special in my opinion. But Elemental Evil changed two of these for the worse, much worse.\n\nCompared to the first 60 levels, it's story is really poorly written. It's like they didn't even bother to delve into massive sea of lore that is Forgotten Realms, but instead they made bad guys suddenly just pop up and attack us. That's it, there's nothing more to than that (except for an old friend, well technically two). No satisfying explanation, diologue or anything, they just attack and we just kill.\nAlso, I was very confused and upset to see Neverwinter using the grinding system, especially in a game that was never meant to be that way.

Let me point out why it didn't.\n\n1. Graphics: I don't have that good of a computer, which sucks. With newer mmorpgs, i have to turn it to low to avoid lag. In this, not only was it horrible looking on low, it lagged quite a bit. AA looked and ran better. So in short, the graphics are dependent on your pc. For me, they were horrible, with heavily pixilated details when they appeared.\n\n2. Gameplay: Now, this is the main reason I played the game for more than an hour. You have a smaller hotbar of skills, making you think about what skills you will pick. I played the Guardian guy, and the combat was solid. It was similar to Tera in you don't just click and target, you do each slash individually. And if you play the class I did, you can actually block with your shield, which is small byt refreshing. You also have this ultimate skill which is pretty cool. Overall, ifound the combat fun. A little easy, and it can become repetitive, but fun.\n\n3. Community: The small interaction I had with others was not positive. I asked for help finding a rare item, and was told to screw off. When I did a little dungeon thing, people expected me to know exactly where things would pop up because they had been grinding it. It also has the "greed/Need" thing, which i didn't get AT ALL. Most of the time I do, but there was no explanation of it. So I asked and was given many rude comments. The DDO people were nicer, and on the server I played on I met maybe 10 people. It may have been dead, but it was way better.\n\n4. Misc. Stuff: The H.U.D. confused me. It looked like those free to play things where there is a small area to see, your hotbar and meters, then a whole crap-ton of shops and things. I didn't play long enough to see if it was pay to win. I tend to be strictly PVE, so i can't say anything about pvp. Also, the world felt... closed off. Smaller and less open than other mmos. It also doesn't have tutorials where they are needed most of the time.\n\nOverall: I'm not reccomending it. I've played three different editions of D&D, and I can say if you want to RP or have a D&D-like game, this probably isn't for you. Dungeons and Dragons Online was much better, even though the combat was slow and the game was dead. If they had just redone DDO but overhauled the combat, I would have loved this. But they didn't, and instead made this. I see potential if they changed a few things: Make it less cluttered, add more tutorials and change the graphics a bit, just to name three that would make me consider coming back.","July 28, 2015","false","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was, sorely, disappointed.  All of the Dragon Born NPCs treat you as if you are just another adventurer instead of one of their own.  Cryptic was lazy and did not create any helmet art other than the 2 pieces that come in the pack.  One is for a ceremonial fashion set and the other simple overlapping plates on the head.  The 'toon' looks ridiculous on a horse, so if you are one those who wants your character to look cool, you will have to buy (with real money) a larger mount.  To get the Metalic Dragon skins, you will have to gamble your way thru lockboxes, that are only available for Astral Diamonds, and buy however many keys (about $1.25 each) it takes to get it.\n\nThe other content is okay.  The bag helps to keep from having to find a vendor all the time, The Heart of the Red dragon artifact helps at low levels and the ring is okay.  The rest of it is just fluff.  You can't even use the overloads until you reach 60th level and then only in special sets of armor you have to grind your way to get.\n\nNot worth $75.  Not even worth the $60 I paid for it while it was on sale.  If you just have to have the dragon born race, spend the $25 to get a race reroll token (less if you get an in-game coupon for 15% off any zen market item).  The race reroll token can be use, after creating a regular character, to reroll it as a dragon born.","August 3, 2015","false","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

It feels more like an action adventure game, where position and dodging is key to survive.\n\nCons: A) BUUUUUUGSSSSSSS: The game was launched as a full game on june 2013, so you´ll think the game is in a playable state, yet the VERY FIRST DUNGEON in the game was bugged and to my knowledge to this day its still bugged and it cant be completed and the fourt dungeon you can access was also bugged and couldnt be completed. I understand that MMO may have bugs and glitches after release, but after a year, having your VERY FIRST DUNGEON IN THE GAME BUGGED IS UNACCEPTABLE....also crashes, falling through the map, dungeon bosses who wont drop any loot, etc\n\nB) The time you spend leveling from 1 to 60 is the most repetitive process i have ever seen in an mmo. You start in a city, you get a quest to teleport to a certain area, you go there, accept a bunch of quest that involve either killing X amount of enemies or gather X amount of materials, you complete them and then you get 1 more quest that asks you to go to a unique instance and fight a mini boss, you go back to the quest giver who tells you to go to a different quest giver in a different part of the area, once you get there is the same thing...5 to 7 quest and then a miniboss, you do this 3 times before you are sent back to the city to go to a different area....AND THIS HAPPENS IN EVERY AREA, 5-7 quest, mini boss, do this 3 times and you are done with that area\n\nC) Even though you can be a f2p without a problem, from lvl 1 to 60, everything in the game is hiden behind a paywall. Like any other MMO by perfect world enterteinment, the game has 3 different kinds of currency\n\n1)Bronze, silver and gold coins: Classic mmo currency, that is basically useless, since the things you can buy with it are limited to potions, 1 single mount (a horse that comes in 6 differnet colors) and very low lvl gear.\n\n2)Astral diamonds: Unique currency in the game that can be obtained by doing daily quest or by doing certain profession tasks. This is the most usefull currency in the game and so the hardest to get. You can use it to buy high lvl gear (you can pretty much avoid the dungeon grinding for gear at lvl 60 and buy a whole set of gear using diamonds) The auction house items can ONLY be bought with astral diamonds, unique mounts, cosmetics, basically everything that you cant buy with the previous currency must be bought with astral diamonds, especially the most important item in the game...the scroll of identification, that are used to idenfity gear so you can see the stats and wear it and since enemies have a higher chance of dropping gear than scrolls you are going to end up with a bag full of green or blue items that you cant wear because you dont have scrolls.\n\n3) Zen: The universal currency of everysingle perfect world entertainment game, can only be bought with real-life money and you can use it to buy more astral daimonds or other items like keys used to open lockboxes or the most basic feature of every mmo out there...resseting your character stats in case you made a mistake, yep, you can only "respec" your character if you pay real money...thankfully there is an in-game feature that allows real players to offer zen for astral diamonds, so you can grind astral diamonds and buy zen without spending any money...but since the people who buy zen are the ones who put a price, the amount of diamonds needed for a decent amount of zen is astronomical.\n\nNow you may think thats not a big deal since that doesnt necessary means the game is pay to win....well think again, you can actually see videos online of people soloing dungeons in the game because they bought high-level gear or special items like scrolls that allow you to resurrect the moment you are killed so the bosses health wont reset.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU5ZpAs8aWE  <---- a perfect example of what i´m talking about","April 27, 2014","false","53.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You roll a few different character classes like you would in any MMO just to play around. It is at this point that you finally see Neverwinter's greatest flaw. Redundency. Every class feels like it plays exactly the same. Every dungeon run, even with different people plays exactly the same. In order to get any of the currency you need for trading on the auction house, or if you want to trade for paid currency, you have to play the same redundent dailys over and over again. Most MMOs don't really start to feel redundent until late game but Neverwinter seems to accomplish that after level ten.\n\nI really really wanted to like it, as I said before the story was quite good, and the character created quests seemed interesting but Neverwinter just gets bogged down by it's own redundency. If you want to play it with one charcter and stick to that one character all the way till max level just to experience the story that could be an okay experience. Venturing beyond that and trying to play the game as an MMO instead of a single player game and the "magic" of game starts to truly fall apart.","February 23, 2014","false","112.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You start in a city, you get a quest to teleport to a certain area, you go there, accept a bunch of quest that involve either killing X amount of enemies or gather X amount of materials, you complete them and then you get 1 more quest that asks you to go to a unique instance and fight a mini boss, you go back to the quest giver who tells you to go to a different quest giver in a different part of the area, once you get there is the same thing...5 to 7 quest and then a miniboss, you do this 3 times before you are sent back to the city to go to a different area....AND THIS HAPPENS IN EVERY AREA, 5-7 quest, mini boss, do this 3 times and you are done with that area\n\nC) Even though you can be a f2p without a problem, from lvl 1 to 60, everything in the game is hiden behind a paywall. Like any other MMO by perfect world enterteinment, the game has 3 different kinds of currency\n\n1)Bronze, silver and gold coins: Classic mmo currency, that is basically useless, since the things you can buy with it are limited to potions, 1 single mount (a horse that comes in 6 differnet colors) and very low lvl gear.\n\n2)Astral diamonds: Unique currency in the game that can be obtained by doing daily quest or by doing certain profession tasks. This is the most usefull currency in the game and so the hardest to get. You can use it to buy high lvl gear (you can pretty much avoid the dungeon grinding for gear at lvl 60 and buy a whole set of gear using diamonds) The auction house items can ONLY be bought with astral diamonds, unique mounts, cosmetics, basically everything that you cant buy with the previous currency must be bought with astral diamonds, especially the most important item in the game...the scroll of identification, that are used to idenfity gear so you can see the stats and wear it and since enemies have a higher chance of dropping gear than scrolls you are going to end up with a bag full of green or blue items that you cant wear because you dont have scrolls.\n\n3) Zen: The universal currency of everysingle perfect world entertainment game, can only be bought with real-life money and you can use it to buy more astral daimonds or other items like keys used to open lockboxes or the most basic feature of every mmo out there...resseting your character stats in case you made a mistake, yep, you can only "respec" your character if you pay real money...thankfully there is an in-game feature that allows real players to offer zen for astral diamonds, so you can grind astral diamonds and buy zen without spending any money...but since the people who buy zen are the ones who put a price, the amount of diamonds needed for a decent amount of zen is astronomical.\n\nNow you may think thats not a big deal since that doesnt necessary means the game is pay to win....well think again, you can actually see videos online of people soloing dungeons in the game because they bought high-level gear or special items like scrolls that allow you to resurrect the moment you are killed so the bosses health wont reset.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU5ZpAs8aWE  <---- a perfect example of what i´m talking about","April 27, 2014","false","53.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To that end nearly all development time is devoted to make more sellable items. The many bugs in the game, even the game breaking ones like dungeon chests always giving the same loot, go unaddressed for a long time. Exploits have destroyed the economy and using them has gone unpunished meaning that especially as new player you will be faced with prices you won't be able to pay even for simple items.\nBut as that means that some people might buy Zen for real money this was not addressed by Cryptic at all.\n\nThe prices of all items you can buy with real money are just laughable. $70 for a badly made race (they do not even have helmet textures) or $50 for skipping content (which is mind numbingly boring like all campaigns cryptic does but give permanent bonuses). To hide the true cost items can only rarely be bought separatly and are instead bundled together with lots of useless stuff. Cryptic is also not above using fake sales like selling the Dragonborn pack for $75 for a limited time instead of $100, but after the "sale" ends they change the normal price to $75.\n\nTo keep players in line the official forums are patrolled heavily by mods and any mentioning of problems in the game will get the post deleted and you might also get banned. This includes warnings others about mislabeled "Bind on Equip" items which are instead "Bind on Pickup" (the current bug that shall not be named).\n\nAnd finally Steam users are constantly harrased in the game as Cryptic wants to push their ARC launcher instead of steam. That means when you buy something through steam you are on probation for several weeks and face severe restrictions until Cryptic verifies that your money is good. And redeeming keys is only possible with the ARC launcher and not through a website.\n\nStay away from the game, the greedy practices of Cryptic and the neglect of actual issues is sucking all potential fun out of it.","September 1, 2014","false","456.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You roll a few different character classes like you would in any MMO just to play around. It is at this point that you finally see Neverwinter's greatest flaw. Redundency. Every class feels like it plays exactly the same. Every dungeon run, even with different people plays exactly the same. In order to get any of the currency you need for trading on the auction house, or if you want to trade for paid currency, you have to play the same redundent dailys over and over again. Most MMOs don't really start to feel redundent until late game but Neverwinter seems to accomplish that after level ten.\n\nI really really wanted to like it, as I said before the story was quite good, and the character created quests seemed interesting but Neverwinter just gets bogged down by it's own redundency. If you want to play it with one charcter and stick to that one character all the way till max level just to experience the story that could be an okay experience. Venturing beyond that and trying to play the game as an MMO instead of a single player game and the "magic" of game starts to truly fall apart.","February 23, 2014","false","112.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I never got an answer to the issues I made notices for from no GM, even after weeks after I posted them.\nConclusion?

It was very fun to start, all the way until level cap.  At which point, the pay to win started to show itself.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to have adequate gear to do ANYTHING but dailies (yawn) when you initially hit level cap.  I spent $100 on zen, converted it to ED, bought all the best gear I could on the AH at level cap.  And I still had a GS of only 12K.  That is completely unacceptable.  Not to mention how long it would have taken had I simply played enough to get that gear.\n\nFun until level cap, then worst game ever.  Then prepare to cry when every group you join for dungeons falls apart by the first group of mobs.  Every group of pvp has some twinked out rogues who have perma invisibilty and attack and then run off like pansies.  Only to do this repeatedly until you are murdered, without even touching them.","March 27, 2014","false","169.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Early on I found myself getting some rare drops from the monsters, which all ended up being chests that I can open with a key I can buy for actual money to get a chance at getting rare gear.\n\nThe areas early on are bland. They are very, very generic fantasy castle zones colored in different shades of grey and brown. The game hasn't kept me entertained long enough to actually get further.\n\nThe quests are boring. Nearly all of them are "go to generic npc, kill mobs/do a dungeon, kill a guy." Haven't had much fun with the quest descriptions either.\n\nThe interface and menus are confusing and weird too. Now, this is entirely personal, but the game ran pretty ♥♥♥♥♥ily on my PC too, even when my specs are better than the recommended specs. No matter how low I set my graphics, it stuttered a lot, so I won't recommend it to players with low end pcs.\n\nThe one thing I did like was the combat system. It wasn't just right-click and button spam, it was pretty dynamic, although mechanics were still very simple, and it got boring rather fast, especially since there's only a few abilities you can use.\n\nIt looked very promising, but due to it's multiple issues it turned out really disappointing. I didn't even mention the DLC that adds up to, I think, about 400$ dollars. Most of the dlc content is stuff most MMO devs would throw in a free update, or just take a bunch of them and add them in an expansion pack. I mean, there's a DLC for 70 euro which gives you access to a new race, some items and I'm guessing maybe a few zones. You can buy WoW with all of it's expansion packs before Warlords + a month or 2 of gametime if you look hard enough.\n\n\nTo sum it up: Neverwinter is a very generic fantasy MMO mess filled to the brim with additional purchases(most of which are terrible deals).","January 17, 2015","false","6.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The best part by far is the Neverwinter Gateway - a website you can log into to run new crafting missions, and play a dice game which is actually kinda fun to level your companions, earn rewards, etc...\n\nAside from that though, the combat is a little boring, you have access to numerous skills, but can only ever have a few of them que'ed as active.  The zones are relatively small and linear, limiting your options and forcing you to play the way the devs want you to play.\n\nAnd as you have read in numerous other reviews, this isn't really a free-to-play game, if you want to enjoy it (and have all the best toys) you have to spend money, lots of it.\n\nIt should be noted I didn't stick around for the end game, it just wasn't that interesting to make me think it was worth the time.","December 28, 2014","false","59.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Baseik/recommended/109600/","Baseik","Baseik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Baseik/","26 products in account","Game by Cryptic and Perfect World. It's an interesting game with a lot of intensive roleplay options, along with even more interesting monsters to kill and some interesting dialog to be read.\n\nI got to level 60, but prior was already analyzing what the game really was about in terms of trade, chat, PvE/P content activity, etc.\nWhat I was looking for exactly is:\nIs there an LG? (Level Gap - Means there's an area where you will run into less then 5 players.)\nIs it open world?\nDo people take up on self made content? (Professions, LFW [Looking for Work], roleplay, guilds/clans, etc.)\nPvP and it's aspects. (Is there a way to lone wolf and how can you conqueror at it.)\nPvE and aspects. (Are quests dragging on, npc voice acting, npcs and pathing + activity)\nHow is the auction house? (Is it controlled by a select guild[s] or people, what is sold, LG?)\nCan I avoid the Item Mall?\n\nWhile Neverwinter is a pretty beautiful looking game there's no doubt, but it's locked a set FoV to make sure you think that. No, there is not a zoom in/out option so you have to type in a command to actually change your FoV. Worst of all is in the game you will see a lot of failed rendering and getting close to textures even on the maxed out settings...Shamefully blurry. Looks gorgeous at a distance, one they LOCKED down to make sure of that. If it's not failed rendering, it's bad glitches..From getting stuck in walls, not being able to use the /killme (/stuck) command to simply watching npcs run right through objects and hit you from triple the distance you can hit them at.\n\nBy no means am I a PvP all star, it's not my forte. Am I bad, not really, it's just something I see constantly being destroyed and generic. Neverwinter is no exception somberly. While the modes for PvP are extremely generic like Domination, the actual combat is much more interesting untill you realize the other team is in full PvP gear, and you're not. The difference amount in such is staggering. I have and never will believe in PvP power and resilience gear, it's stupid, unfair and incredibly hindering for new PvPers. Pathetically to say, this game can claim skill as much as it wants you will not be able to kill a person in full PvP gear even if it was 1 vs 10. That's how different PvP gear is to PvE.\n\nAs for PvE, it's just unfulfilling in my eyes. There was this level 18 - 22 zone I was in, and it gave me an option like Diablo and FPS Bots; Easy, Medium, Hard, Elite. I picked Elite because it sounded like fun, and for me to be fighting Battle-tested Orcs, Fire Wizard Orcs both elites, and giant Ogres plus the 10-15 normal archers and melee mobs...Happy is an understatement. I had to use skill to kill off the multiple Ogres and Elites and it was just too much entertainment. Pathetically, this isn't an option for every zone you enter. Frankly if there's no challenge, why play? I've played MMOs for over a decade, it's a reality for me, maybe not others.\n\nNow let's go back to my list, and don't worry this is much shorter and sweet.\nQuestions & Answers:\nIs there an LG? (Level Gap - Means there's an area where you will run into less then 5 players.)\n>There's not much a level gap, 60s seem to be more then willing to help you out if they're not busy and you'll notice the dungeons really aren't hard at all. In fact they're very easy so long as you kill the major ones that can spawn mobs and heal.\nIs it open world?\n>It's not open world. It's battlezoned with one and only one major city. Which is f***ing pathetic in my eyes.\nDo people take up on self made content? (Professions, LFW [Looking for Work], roleplay, guilds/clans, etc.)\n>I can't be too sure yet if people really go into professions, I've yet to see weapons or armor for sale. No one is ever LFWing, as for roleplay, good luck. Doesn't exist at all from what I've seen. As for guilds, I'm not sure if anyone is even ever recruitting but that could just because the gold seller bots never stop. I mean never. You block one and two pop up within two minutes. This isn't a joke I've f***ing timed it. Two hours straight. They never missed a second. What worries me is I'd see a lot of legit names that players would have like "GrimReaper" etc. and it makes me wonder if account hacking is a problem!\nPvP and it's aspects. (Is there a way to lone wolf and how can you conqueror at it.)\n>Yeah, you can lone wolf it pretty easily. "Skill" + PvP gear... = 1 v 5 me bro lol u nub ded..... /♥♥♥♥INGSIGH\nPvE and aspects. (Are quests dragging on, npc voice acting, npcs and pathing + activity)\n>PvE has nothing special, some voice acting is good and the rest is to be questioned of drug use. Quests though are ridiculous and drag on as though to say "We couldn't think of anything else." I'd rather go kill x mobs and get y and z items then deal with a single quest that gives 2,000 exp and drags on for 5 hours. Not to mention you'll get voice acting in some NPCs, then suddenly it's gone. F*** off. What's worse is the Epic Dungeons are nothing more then the same dungeons you went through from 1-59 but now the mobs are level 60+. There is litteraly no other change.\nHow is the auction house? (Is it controlled by a select guild[s] or people, what is sold, LG?)\n>Auction house seems...dead? There's items there for people at and under level 60 and even 20..But nothing good at all. Yet I've seen level 20-30s walking around in nearly full epics. I've never seen an epic yet and I've done nothing but grind quests and dungeons. I really don't know, at least not for levels lower then 60.\nCan I avoid the Item Mall?\n>No. Impossible. Unless you only want ever 2 level 60 characters, you will end up buying items from the Zen market. This is a 100% guarantee, and even if you think it isn't, this is a Zen market game in other words you can exchange an ingame currency (Astral Diamons [AD]) for Zen. And you will do it. I promise you, and with how expensive level 60 gear is in AD, it's a lot better for you to just buy Zen then it is to farm AD. That's your choice.\nFor those wondering, no end game gear as far as I can tell is not ahrd to get at all. I have two days played now on my Trickster Rogue, I'm already worked into Tier 2 Epics with a gear score of 10,000 (About half the assumed max.) People take the pay-to-win route a lot and you will see it heavily, but you can make it without. It's just not as easy, and very, very annoying.\n\nDo I like this game? No.\nWould I recommend it? No..It's too easy to level in and too generic. Nothing stands out at all, even their target and combat system has been done and much better.","December 31, 2014","false","243.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Firstly,  as a compulsive RPG hoarder, you start of with a very spartan amount of storage space for the many items you'll pick up and sell along the way. Half of the time I was playing, it was staring at the screen when it was telling me that my inventory was full. You'll get another bag at later levels, but it only provides around 12 spaces of inventory. I thought, "Hey, that's no problem. Maybe I can start crafting my own bags!" Nope. You get what you get, unless you want to pay real money. It also has some very imbalanced-feeling PvP, where you're steamrolling one team and getting destroyed by the next. Nearly everything in the game has its natural progression blocked to a dead stop until you a. find some way to farm the correct currency or b. pay up. I would like to support companies that make good content and give me very good reason to pay for premium features, but when the first thing you see is advertisements for ingame stuff that you would end up paying real money for, and a distractingly shiny "pay me!" logo in the interface itself, that's where I have to draw the line.","January 3, 2015","false","24.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Let me point out why it didn't.\n\n1. Graphics: I don't have that good of a computer, which sucks. With newer mmorpgs, i have to turn it to low to avoid lag. In this, not only was it horrible looking on low, it lagged quite a bit. AA looked and ran better. So in short, the graphics are dependent on your pc. For me, they were horrible, with heavily pixilated details when they appeared.\n\n2. Gameplay: Now, this is the main reason I played the game for more than an hour. You have a smaller hotbar of skills, making you think about what skills you will pick. I played the Guardian guy, and the combat was solid. It was similar to Tera in you don't just click and target, you do each slash individually. And if you play the class I did, you can actually block with your shield, which is small byt refreshing. You also have this ultimate skill which is pretty cool. Overall, ifound the combat fun. A little easy, and it can become repetitive, but fun.\n\n3. Community: The small interaction I had with others was not positive. I asked for help finding a rare item, and was told to screw off. When I did a little dungeon thing, people expected me to know exactly where things would pop up because they had been grinding it. It also has the "greed/Need" thing, which i didn't get AT ALL. Most of the time I do, but there was no explanation of it. So I asked and was given many rude comments. The DDO people were nicer, and on the server I played on I met maybe 10 people. It may have been dead, but it was way better.\n\n4. Misc. Stuff: The H.U.D. confused me. It looked like those free to play things where there is a small area to see, your hotbar and meters, then a whole crap-ton of shops and things. I didn't play long enough to see if it was pay to win. I tend to be strictly PVE, so i can't say anything about pvp. Also, the world felt... closed off. Smaller and less open than other mmos. It also doesn't have tutorials where they are needed most of the time.\n\nOverall: I'm not reccomending it. I've played three different editions of D&D, and I can say if you want to RP or have a D&D-like game, this probably isn't for you. Dungeons and Dragons Online was much better, even though the combat was slow and the game was dead. If they had just redone DDO but overhauled the combat, I would have loved this. But they didn't, and instead made this. I see potential if they changed a few things: Make it less cluttered, add more tutorials and change the graphics a bit, just to name three that would make me consider coming back.","July 28, 2015","false","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was, sorely, disappointed.  All of the Dragon Born NPCs treat you as if you are just another adventurer instead of one of their own.  Cryptic was lazy and did not create any helmet art other than the 2 pieces that come in the pack.  One is for a ceremonial fashion set and the other simple overlapping plates on the head.  The 'toon' looks ridiculous on a horse, so if you are one those who wants your character to look cool, you will have to buy (with real money) a larger mount.  To get the Metalic Dragon skins, you will have to gamble your way thru lockboxes, that are only available for Astral Diamonds, and buy however many keys (about $1.25 each) it takes to get it.\n\nThe other content is okay.  The bag helps to keep from having to find a vendor all the time, The Heart of the Red dragon artifact helps at low levels and the ring is okay.  The rest of it is just fluff.  You can't even use the overloads until you reach 60th level and then only in special sets of armor you have to grind your way to get.\n\nNot worth $75.  Not even worth the $60 I paid for it while it was on sale.

The race reroll token can be use, after creating a regular character, to reroll it as a dragon born.","August 3, 2015","false","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MeF/recommended/109600/","MeF","MeF.XES","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MeF/","268 products in account","I found this game through Steam but played mostly without Steam.\n\nI have two lvl70 chars, a Scourge Warlock, the first one, and the Oathbound Paladin, my main char now.\n\nAt first this game felt amazing. Beautiful graphics (I turn off Post Processing and Bloom because I don't like the result, performance is amazing here even at 2560x1440 with everything maxed out), lots of customizations and classes, races, quests, refinements, wow. A lot to discover and try, so a lot of fun.\n\nAfter a while I found I was stuck, or the progress was slowing down a lot, and the main cause was clear: unless spending real money I could never have enough to keep progressing.\n\nAnd when I could try the content to better geared chars, the game turned into a complete mess. We have, for example, Valindra's Tower, Malabog's Castle and Epic Lair of Lostmauth. You need to wait in a virtual line to get in any of those. Sometimes you wait for 30 minutes, 40 minutes, or even more. And when you can go in, lag lag lag. And by lag, I really really mean it. You start to rubberband a lot, timewarp a lot, commands take 1 to 2 seconds to work. I listed Valindra's Tower, Malabog's Castle and Epic Lair of Lostmauth. After maybe two months doing quests while waiting to enter these, the first two were absolutely unplayable with most people simply leaving due to the lag. I coundn't finish the first two due to that. The Epic Lair of Lostmauth I finished only once, and when I did, the price, a chest for you to open and pick your rewards bugged and I couldn't pick anything. So I tried again and again over and over (I needed the armor and due to the lag I could't foresee any other chance to get it), maybe 20 tries or more, and it worked. I recorded a video showing this.\n\nWell, after playing for a while and playing A LOT everyday, I ended only logging to do some daily quests to advance in the campaigns.\n\nAnd my chars are stuck because I'm not putting any money on this game because it feels like they may change important things anytime; because I can't play very important parts of the game, the most difficult and rewarding ones, due to lag and bugs; because paying is the only way to succed here. And you need to pay a lot.\n\nNote that I don't even mention PVP. PVP in this game is the most stupid thing I ever seen.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to say that my forst char was abandoned because it was a god until lvl60 but after that turned into suffering and frustration, dying all the time to anything. I kept playing with it until after the lvl70 (and two or three excess lvls so I have many things maxed out to IV) but the char kept dying over and over again, too weak for anything. I tried different gear, different combination of stats, maxing defense, maxing deflection, maxing power, arpen, crit, making it balanced, nothing worked.\n\nThen I created the OP and even before the lvl70, when I was like lvl67, I was destroying everything the first char couldn't even face. The difference is HUGE. I can leave this char afk in the same places where the first char can't even walk in alone.\n\nThis game is unbalanced like hell.","August 10, 2015","false","69.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I am just scratching the top of the end Game content and the entire game is buggy. The last straw was when i was joining a group in an end-game dungeon and the game couldn't keep up with the players, players were randomly teleporting around trying to walk forward and they said "I haven't been able to play this dungeon all week everyone file a bug report." I was thinking it was only that dungeon so i joined another one which went smoothly until the boss fight where he would attack from a stand-still stance with no indication he was attacking, teleport around, and his spiral flames that circle the outer ring of the boss fight would glitch out. The animation would stop moving but it would still register hitting you and send the player off the edge. I would not recommend getting invested in this game until they fix the server lag.

I've been playing this game since mod 4 or something and many things have changed.In fact, i want to be accurate and i've been playing this game since Dread Ring was released.Before even Hunter Ranger,Scourge Warlock and Oathbound Paladin classes were even realeased.For those who have played this game they know the Dread Ring Campaign,they have played this game just before it's release date they know about what times i'm talking about.Back then there was no overflow experience and not 70 level being the maximum level.I rememember dungeons were divided in 3 tiers and the highest gear score(which is basically one's player stats)was about 21k and maximum HP about 50k(which back then it was something mad) and i'm talking about full epic equipment with full rank 10 enchantments.Things back then were not that easy but still.After i've realised the servers have be treated poorely by the developers and now the game is evolved into a stealing money machine i've reached into a conclusion.After experiencing the whole game after mod 6 i've grown tired of this,after watching everything change into some sort of artifact hunt and mythic b*llshit,after trancendent vorpal enchantments got out and rank 12 enchantments worthing a hell lot of money i understood that this game has been destroyed.Around 500 hours on Steam and same as many in Arc launcher almost to 1000 hours of gameplay i realised that i will be never be bored to the gameplay of this game.Because it is amazing but as i said before i'm tired of this sick growing development.If you are still reading this, good job.. many would have just ignored that or pass this review just like an old dusty book in a library but if you are the one curious to open and read that old dusty book,you are from now on a really good path because only dusty books hide some secrets and let's say that this review is just one of them.I'm telling that you will love this game but after spending all this time on this game and you reach to an end you'll then realise that it was a waste of time. Because gaming has now lost its own sense and meaning and you will really wonder why haven't you spent all this time somewhere else so in the end you would be satisfied.In all means(and just because i'm a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ writing all this huge boring sh*ty review)i'm telling to play this game and you will have fun.You will come down my path and you'll experience as much as i had but in the end it doesn't even matter.So fellow gamer good luck :)\nand don't forget it's good to explore new places.","June 6","false","529.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I feel a much better description would be a dungeon hack-and-slash with some MMO trappings. Character customization is bare bones, even leaving out the fact that certain iconic races are locked away behind the pay wall. You're able to choose your character's sex, race, and class along with his/her origin and patron deity. The latter two are surprisingly limited, given the setting; even in 4th Edition's greatly reduced pantheon, there are a number of gods and goddesses worshipped by the people of Faerun, yet the game only gives you a fraction. Likewise, the origins only cover a handful of locales in the Realms. It quickly becomes apparent that this game was not made for diehard fans of Forgotten Realms.\n\nIf you're looking for a worthy successor to Neverwinter Nights, you will not find it in this game. The Foundry is a poor substitute for that legendary series' robust world-building and DM tools, with even the most highly regarded player-created dungeons essentially boiling down to the same formulaic hack-and-slash gameplay of the main game. I cannot recommend this game to anyone looking for a meaningful MMO experience. With a friend or two, some fun can be had in  fighting your way through waves of kobolds and orcs so long as you keep your expectations in check.\n\nOverall: Pass","February 11, 2015","false","11.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/krazyorange/recommended/109600/","krazyorange","Starfarts","http://steamcommunity.com/id/krazyorange/","289 products in account","A game that starts strong but collapses into a world where you're forced to dance along a drum line of serrated drill-bit sex toys that continually penetrate your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ while you beg for forgiveness. You'll pray to "wake up," but then the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ will chant "can't wake up" as they gnaw at your colon from the inside.\n\nPROS\n---Combat gameplay is fluid, vicious, and fun as hell. I can only speak from experience as a single-target DPS trickster rogue, but the glee I felt from stealthing-and-stabbing never faded even as enemies' hit points rose.\n---Leveling from 1-60, for me, averaged about 45 minutes per rank. I wasn't rushing to cap, either, and while I admit my eyes glazed over the quest text halfway through the storyline, I wasn't sprinting. Fast, but not too fast.\n---Events, skirmishes, and dungeons are great breaks from regular questing, though having to pay for chest keys (with in-game currency or with IRL munz) after the once-per-day free one is lame. I get it though: a company has to make money somehow, which is why this stays under positive.\n---Professions can all be leveled and no progress is lost (there's no swapping out mechanic--they're all available all the time).\n---The auction house is totally open for F2P players.\n---Minsc and Boo for us elderly BG players to get a nostalgiagiggle from.\n\nNEUTRAL\n---Quests from 1-60 are relatively-basic MMO trash, but I never got bored because of how brutal the combat was.\n---It's not an open-world game, but the above-ground instances are large enough to require mounts.\n---Sparkling lines and the linear nature of most of the world means you'll never get lost.\n\nCONS\n---The 60-70 grind is absolute garbage. There are no scripted/plotted quests; instead, all you get are repeatable hourlies set in a couple different areas that give tiny chunks of XP. Grind in MMOs is fine. This is like being bound in leather straps and lowered ♥♥♥-first onto a chainsaw of OhMiBods made out of shark teeth. It doesn't sound so bad reading it here, but in-game, after having so much fun from 1-60, it's like taking your supermodel date home from dinner and finding out instead of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ she has a black hole that leads directly into Satan's urethra.\n---All of the endgame level 60 content from previous patches has been shifted to level 70, leaving the hourlies as the only content to carry the ten longest and most difficult ranks in the game. WHY.\n---The paid DLC is hilariously overpriced.\n---Loads of the in-game tooltips have outdated text, as well as the official wiki and the Neverwinter website. Aren't there interns for this? Or fan volunteers?\n---There seems to be no effort to combat spammers and farmers. I get a new friend request every five minutes from someone wanting to trade or sell me something. My inbox is always full of spam as well. It doesn't sound that bad, but when you're kiting for your life and some prick sends you a request it gets annoying.\n---The "need, greed, pass" popups in dungeons and skirmishes are virtually in the middle of the screen. And there's always that one nub ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who feels the need to pick up every green item he sees, which forces the prompts to stack, literally filling the screen with them. WHY.\n---Because there are no traditional gathering nodes (all resources are collected from enemies and occasional, randomized nodes that require kits to interact with), I can't unleash my inner hoarding and trading personality. I won't really hold this one against Neverwinter, though, because I imagine it's to combat ♥♥♥♥tarded BR farmers. Still, annoying.\n\nSUMMARY\nIt's free. You technically can get all the stuff from the premium shop with in-game munz. The 1-60 process was a blast. But from then on it's a completely-different grind that's totally not worth your time. Find a different game until they add something to make those ten levels more entertaining. (And no, it's not "my problem" that they're insufferable. The ten hardest levels in the game shouldn't be less fun than getting my bum waxed in preparation for my date with @Nero. They should be the MOST fun, with deference for perhaps the FIRST ten.)\n\nDrizzt was a nice touch with the new mod, but still, his stuff is locked out at the 70 cap.

I've been playing since July 2015, and it's extremely easy to level characters to play End-Game content, but so repetitive when you finally get to the end-game content that you want to start another character just to enjoy something different to break the monotony.\nAnd they've finally figured out that the best way to make money is to essentially force players to buy most everything via ZEN  which is predominantly purchased with Real World Money.. because they've created numerous mechanisms e.g. Bound to Account BoA and Bound to Character BoC items that you are guarenteed to have inventory issues requiring buying Bank Slots(ZEN)  buying Bags (ZEN).  Other mechanisms that require ZEN are the Astral Diamond Exchange (Astral Diamond - AD) an in-game currency; which like most every MMO, they've made so many mistakes creating an economy for, that people exploited the hell out of it.. and made massive piles of AD  making the exchange market a joke for any peron who wasn't either exploiting it or buying it with Real World Money.\nThe next way to soak up your time and money is in the form of Artifacts; Artifacts are weapons and equipment that are mostly End-game items, there are numerous artifacts you can have from around level 20, but the weapons and equipment will not be avaialbale till a player reaches level 70(Max level)  and can only be upgraded with Refining Stones and a few other very Minor things like lvl 60+ weapons, and considering it will take so many of these items that the people making money on refining stones and refinment items is split about 70/30  Exploiters-Botters/Cryptic  the exploiters run mass amounts of bots farming anything they can sell on the Astral Diamond exchange and Cryptic expects you to buy most everything else from them to actualy complete and finish refining an item to make it more powerful.\nOther than Cryptic's lame claim that they are trying to make the game playable for people "with time to play" and people "with money to play" they are very definitely focused on soaking money from people in the latter category.\nThe most annoying thing beyond the money grab is that the game has so many glitches and development screw-ups that if you enjoy playing all of the content and reading all of the stories and background.. you may miss a whole lot, because they've broken nearly every Dungeon that isn't part of End-Game content and if you level too fast or power level you will not be able to go back and finish any of it, because they're too focused on keeping up the End-game content and keeping people paying that they're avoiding fixing the lower level dungeons.  The easy fix has been in most every other MMO i've played,  You power leveled past some stuff, so you join with a group of people to play that older content and your overall level etc is reduced back to the level of the content.  But 5+ mods/expansion later and they're still ignoring that massive gaping hole --that DnD fans like the content and the story--, which most DnD fans I know would/should be pi$$ed about.\nMy biggest gripe isnt that they want to make a proifit, you cant keep a good genre MMO alive without money, but that they are ruining the DnD name with they're inept development and managment of a great Genre of MMO.","December 2, 2015","false","266.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doubledeuce/recommended/109600/","doubledeuce","Double Deuce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doubledeuce/","153 products in account","This surprised me, for a f2p its not bad.\n\nPros: PvE this is where the game shines.  There's different  queues for dungeons and skirmishes (team up with people to defeat an outdoor mini dungeon) for your level range.  There's also the foundry which has thousands of player made content which is always being updated and keeps things fresh.  You can of course create a foundry mission which the community can play and applies to the previous statement.\n\nCons: The classes have balancing issues in pvp and if people have better gear than  you then you'll get rolled but if you farm enough you can get the same gear but its mildly pay to win.  There's class issues in PvE as well for instance I played a tank (so  called) which would lead you to believe you would tank, hold aggro, and be a damage sponge.  This is not the case.\n\nYou spend most of your time  running out of the red spots as a tank, which means you aren't dps'ing, which means you're not generating enough threat to hold aggro.  If you stand  in the red and don't block you take huge damage...as a fully geared tank, and spec'ed full tank (I tried both the tank trees in full defensive gear 51% dmg reduction, 32% parry which is very high, and 15% aoe reduction, a large hp pool, among other things) you take massive damage.\n\nYour only hope is to use your aoe taunt which has a long cooldown, and spam your fighters recovery daily which unless you're tactician you wont have up when you  need it so thats the  only viable spec I've found.  The so called cookie cutter spec is to stack attack power and go down the tree  that gives you double attack power if you have full block (which means if you block your dps is lowered based on how much shield you have remaining).  This is great for threat, but you can't take much damage and the healing in  this game is pretty bad imo.  This saddens me as I only had an interest in tanking in NW and they've failed the class.  Tanks aren't taken most of the time end game, people would rather have ranged and cc ( ranger and control wizard) control means no healing and more aoe damage potential.\n\nUntil they fix the tank class to be able to actually tank I wont be playing the game.\n\n============================================================\n\nI did create a foundry mission which was very time consuming (you can spend as much or as little time as you wish on a foundry mission) as I chose to build my own multi-story building (very limited tools made this a lot harder than  it needed to be, for example, if you could select more than one object to copy / paste, it  would have saved me days of work if not more).\n\nThe community can rate your foundry mission in a 5 star system if they play it and for the most part the community in the foundry is good.  But since most people don't create foundry missions, they don't appreciate how long it takes to make them.  If you want an example do a search for my foundry mission "Ghost - behind enemy lines" and play it.  That foundry took me over 3 weeks to make and I'm out of work so that means every day I was working on it (most of the time was building the last building).\n\nIts not all bad though, I went into the foundry  sort of knowing it would take a while and some people would be unappreciative but for the most  part the reviews were friendly and the comments some people had were very  satisfying and thoughtful.  People can donate astral diamonds to you if they wish and a lot of people do so that's nice.  If the community rates it high enough it can be hosted by the devs.   People play your content and enjoy it, that makes you feel like you wrote a novel (which you actually are an author in this case) and people like it, this makes it worth it.","March 3, 2014","true","325.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The game itself is a strong MMO, if a bit outdated on the graphics end.\n\nMy reasons for giving a bad review is the 'free to play' claim. While I have no real issue with a game that allows players to purchase the best gear, this should be a shortcut - nothing more. It is technically true that players CAN access the paid content by trading in-game currency for ZEN (the real money currency), the amount of time to get even a small quantity is highly limiting. But this isn't the major problem. The major problem I have is that it seems like everything in the game is locked behind that pay-wall; need more bags? Zen. A mount upgrade? Zen. Bank slots? Zen. Character slots? Zen. Re-spec? Zen. Access to the [current] best-in-slot gear? Zen. Better companions? Zen. Upgrade companions? Zen (or an astronomical anount of ingame currency). And the prices are, quite frankly, offensive: 16 bank slots on a single character? That'll run you about $6. That's more than a character slot. Some mounts are $40. The lowest rank bag? $6. Whoever priced this stuff needs to lose his job - and everyone who actually paid these prices is only enabling this mess. I want to see the game succeed, because I enjoy playing it. But that isn't going to happen if everyone actually pays their exorbant prices.\n\nFinally, I was forced to post this here because the developers refuse to allow posts about thier 'pay to win' pricing at all in their forums. They know it's an issue, and their response is to be adversarial - they clearly don't treat their customers with respect and think of them as little more than piggy banks.","November 2, 2015","false","226.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

The game is not incredibly complex, but it has an intricate balance.  I really enjoyed my time in the game... and even outside of it.\n\nThe dynamic of playing the game from a browser with my companions is brilliant.  The fact that I can craft from the same browser is amazing!  If they had an app that did something similar, I'd almost pay a small monthly fee for it.\n\nThe companion system by itself is actually pretty awesome.  Someone to hang out with you and support or tank or fill whatever gap you have is pretty awesome.  While some of them could stand to be a little better, they are pretty good overall and the ones at the beginning of the game are very helpful.\n\nMy favorite part, however, is the user created content.  The ability to run a "dungeon" created by another player is amazing.  I've run some good ones and bad ones, but that feature is awesome!  When I say dungeon, it does it a bit of dis-service.  It is more like an entire zone built with encounters, buildings, bosses and loot tables that plays out as a full quest or mission.  Some of them can be done in 10 or 20 minutes, while others may take more than hour.  The difficulty is also variable.\n\nThe micro-transactions for this game can get pricey, but I didn't worry too much about them.  They have some interesting packs and people who plan to invest a lot of time can easily wait until a sale and get a great deal.  IMO, the game is good enough to at least invest a little bit.","November 18, 2015","true","98.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

If you are going to try out the game, know one thing: you will not start to make a good amount of AD, the main currency, until you hit the max level (60). The game's economy is mostly based around the player base and player market. Items that you get from endgame dungeons will either be worth 500 AD or 500,000 AD depending on how badly the buyer wants said item. For instance, I earned a piece of armor a few days ago that sold for 600,000, but today it is worth around 150,000. You may also exchange AD for the premium currency, Zen, which you have the option to pay actually money for. The only thing you can not get in game without paying actually money are the packs which are really not a big deal.\n\nThis is my most played game on steam and I personally think it is very underrated. The questing can feel a bit grindy but it is almost fully voice acted. There is also great deal of lore is case you want to get into it. Otherwise the combat is very quick and responsive, the loot and customization is executed very well, and I feel the game should have a much bigger playerbase.","August 27, 2014","true","567.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","3"

Well, you never can grasp the whole Realms in just a couple of months - it takes years of ACTIVE roleplaying there to know what's going on and Neverwinter shows it just fine.

Ive played so many mmorpgs but i usually end up quiting cuz of the long, boring and endless hours of grinding. However this game is always action packed with the large amount of bosses/dungeons. You level up quickly from following the main quests so it keeps gamers from getting bored of doing the same thing. Dungeons also get SUPER epic when you have a full party of 5 especially when you get later into the game. (level 45+)\n\nGraphics are amazing at full HD quality, character customization is awesome (get to choose races, jobs etc), combat system is great (similar to Tera Rising)-- dodge/block system, PVP is fun (kinda like capture the flag or Dominion in League of Legends), overall game can be competitive (mechanically skilled players can outplay other players with op stuff), and much more.\n\nI reached the max level 60, and during that experience it was HELLA FUN! And it gets way better cuz once you hit 60, you get bombarded with more crazy quests and you can customize your character even more with the access to boons (another skill tree). Overall I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME! It's just amazing bcuz you can have the same amount of fun by yourself or by grabbing some of your buddies to do the dungeons/quests with.\n\n10/10","February 25, 2014","true","96.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

It has the most enjoyable combat out of any MMOs that I have played to date.\n\nAs a free-to-play game, it has a real money (referred to as Zen) cash shop. While all of the items in the cash shop seem expensive, I never felt like I was required to purchase any of them to enjoy the content that everyone else was playing. As you play, you can earn the in-game currency, Astral Diamonds, and exchange it with other players for the Zen that they have purchased. Depending on what you are looking to purchase, the length of the grind required varies dramatically.\n\nAs for content, the Foundry and its "infinite content" is a nice distraction from the developer made quest line. Some of the quests that players have created are absolutely ridiculous, both in personality and in quality.\n\nI highly recommend giving Neverwinter a shot and forming your own decision.

The vast majority of the negative reviews are born out of the gaming communities disgust at having to spend actual money on a game they are playing for free. Let that sentence roll around for a moment.\n\nVery simply it boils down to whether or not you are looking for a suitable end game experience. If you have a lot of money to burn then this is the game for you. If, however, you would like everything to be free in this world (I think someone once said some about the price of a lunch...) then this is not for you.\n\nIf you, like me, are just looking for a casual and beautiful online experience to jump into every now and again, then I would say go for it. After all, it is free.","December 16, 2015","true","56.6"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","1"

It's totally playable without putting a cent into it but you're restricted to two characters. There's no restrictions on the gameplay itself and it's quick to level to 60.\n\nResetting your character's active skills costs "Zen" which is real money, but you shouldn't have to unless you've been playing level 60 for a while. Resetting passive skills called "Feats" cost ingame currency called "Astral Diamonds" and it scales depending on how much points you put into it already. Astral diamonds can be traded for Zen and vise versa to help cover costs for an extra character or a skill reset if you're worried about spending real money, but it takes time to collect enough of.\n\nUnfortunately, the economy is somewhat bloated with bot farmers selling ingame currency for real money, causing some items on the market to be ungodly amount of astral diamonds to buy. Finding a party to get into a dungeon is almost impossible unless you advertise yourself on the "Looking For Group" chat or bring friends. One of the classes, The Devoted Cleric, has a high difficulty curve that can surprise new players and is not recommended to play during your first time unless you know what you're in for. There's also balance issues with enchantments and high level pvp which the developers said to be patched soon.\n\nAll in all, decent free MMO that if you don't have problems with gambling (see TF2 or CS:GO i.e crates), should really only cost you none to 15 USD. Surpisingly fun and the classes feel great and powerful to play. It's recommended, if it is your first time, to just play the game however you want without worrying what build you should spec into.","March 17, 2014","true","78.5"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

The PvE is interesting and a fun thing to run through, it's got great visuals and a large amount of characters. PvP is also present in a big way. The que system is well organized and there is even ranked play. There are also whole different play styles based on pvp (different armor to use, powers, feats, items, etc). The game itself has great visuals and any graphics hungry max setting fps PC behemoth computer builders have a chance to go nuts graphics wise. (Don't worry it also runs on toasters). End game content ramps up the PvE and PvP in a big way with campaigns and artifacts so tons of play value after basic lvling campaign is done. Also like all MMOS you got your guilds and they have events and it's all hunky dory (if you can't tell I tend to solo play).\n\nIf you are new to MMOS NW is great because it in a sense is simple. It guides you in the beginning better than any MMO I have seen. The combat is quick to grasp but still fun and interesting. Figuring out your play style/kit you use comes easily as you settle into your character.\n\nProblems with Neverwinter.\nHoly ♥♥♥♥ we got somethings to talk about: (keep in mind despite all this I still love/am addicted to NW)\nFirst and foremost: this game in a significant manner is pay to win. Endgame PVP is ruined by people that can decimate you due to there incredibly overpowered kits. Seeing a guy that has almost 3x the gear score you have in the same pvp match as you leaves some very lasting effects on my opinion of pvp. Anyway back to the pay system. I recommend that you invest at least a little cash in this game as a jumping off point once you reach lvl 70 just because you won't last a second in pvp if you don't. I wish there was no pay system and we could just upfront pay for Neverwinter so the title Free To Play wasn't slapped on it. Just invest a little on enchantments. And a mount and refining and more refining and even more refining (you get the point)\n\nThe refining system: ok so in this game there are artifacts that you have to charge with refining points to make them better (also enchantments to charge but eh ♥♥♥♥ that). Currently the final ranks of artifacts vary (legendary/mythic) to get to legendary takes waaaayyyyyyyy to many refining points so don't even get me started on mythic. This system in principle is good in practice but holy ♥♥♥♥ it takes to long. Cryptic, listen, do everyone a solid and make refining less of a grind and give us some time left on our lives. Seeing people run around with all mythic gear makes me seriously question the state of their bank account or the state of their social life( no offense no lifers). I can't imagine the time it would take to do that.\n\nBack to PVP: ok so pvp as a game type is great. Capture the points on a 5 on 5 match, fun, simple, organized BUT!!!! BUTT!!!!!!!!! It is so unbalanced. Once in a millennia do I find a game where it is a hard fought good game between two relatively even teams that comes down to a last push or last second play. Almost always there is a clear winner from the beginning. This is always attributed to mismatched gear scores. I should not be a guy with a gear score of 2,600 facing a guy with a GS of 4,500 (measured as of 2/16/16, measuring of gear scores has changed before). Fix this please. Organize it by rank or gear score or whatever, even if it takes longer to que it will be worth it.\n\nAlone vs Party play: if I can recommend anything to newcomers is find a friend early on. I choose to play solo (my choice can't blame the game) but it is hard. Forget dungeon delving alone it can't be done (except you 4.5k GS guy) also things can get a little grindy sometimes and it is nice to have a friend during this time. Also 2 heads are better than 1, NW offers a lot especially lvl 60 and up. Having a friend to help figure things out with will benefit you in many ways. This is less a criticism and more a helpful recommendation. Find a friend or find a guild do it early or be prepared you brave soul.\n\nFINAL NOTE:\nDespite these minor problems ( the few lines of code Satan himself added) I still love NW. Why I don't entirely know. Maybe because I have a serious addiction to a game that can suck money like Gaben during a steam sale or maybe it is a new breath of fresh air in the MMO genre with a nice combat system a wide array of play styles and classes and a constantly updated and changing world with a dedicated dev team. If anything proves that I like this game it is the 330+ hours I have spent on it. Try it, love it for the gameplay and hate it for the pay system but don't miss it.","February 16","true","368.9"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","11","20","4","0"

The story is interesting the gameplay is fun the graphics are smooth and the setting is just great. There are not many things I have found fault in with neverwinter but some of these are as follows, for an mmo neverwinter feels extremely linear with one quest linking to the next all the way to endgame. Another thing I dont like is endgame, I always get bored but this seems to just be the mmo way atm, there content creator helps somewhat in that user generated content can be pretty great, but it does not completely make up for some of the default content lacking that spark that makes it interesting. Even another thing that rubs me the wrong way is pvp, when the game was a newer release there seemed to be a more active pvp scene but now all the matches seem to me unbalanced and boring.\n\nNow dont think for a second I am going to end the recommendation on a sour note, I had a LOT of fun with the game on all my characters up until the point you start to feel that inevitable mmo fatigue. I recommend you try the game yourself to see if you like it or not, yea end game can be grindy, yea there are some ridiculous cash shop items but are these not things we have all come to expect from a free to play mmo? The game has a lot to offer and a lot of fun you can experience without paying a dime or grinding a second, so get out there and get playing!\n\n\n\nUpdate 7/30/14: Neverwinter fans rejoice, Neverwinter is coming to xbox and its getting a new expansion!\n\nUpdate 8/11/15: Neverwinter just keeps getting new content. I have not played in a while but this is good news. I hear its one of the most popular free to play games on Xbox now as well!","December 5, 2013","true","75.3"," 86 of 168 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","86","168","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TakoTuesday/recommended/109600/","TakoTuesday","FusRoMeow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TakoTuesday/","222 products in account","Oh where to begin with Neverwinter. Now this review will most likely bring on a lot of controversy, but who cares.\nNeverwinter is a f2p MMORPG Published by Perfect World. Now a lot of Perfect World games tend to be "Pay to Win" to the extreme. Neverwinter is not pay to win unlike the others. The only thing to win in Neverwinter is PVP, but PVP isn't a big part of the game itself and there are no items you can pay real life money for to help you in PVP. Of course Neverwinter has an in-game currency called "Zen" that you can pay real life money for, but the only thing Zen lets you buy are "Fashion Items", dyes, companions, mounts, and a few other items not essential to own. Now of course like many other MMOs, in game currencies like Zen can allow you to pay for convenience such as buying a fast mount. Mounts serve no purpose other than getting you where you need to go at a quicker rate rather than walking. Is that Pay to Win? NO, it is not. What are you winning? A race to the quest area? People do not like spending real life money on MMOs, but the game is free is it not? So complaining is silly.\n\nAnways, the main currency in Neverwinter (that requires no real life money to earn) is called "Astral Diamonds". You don't want to spend real life money on Neverwinter? Have no fear, with AD you can purchase companions, mounts, and plenty of other neat items. Though for a price. 25k AD is the max you can earn with your daily quests, however, every dungeon you play you have a 90% chance of obtaining a "Purple" item. Purple items sell for a fair amount of AD on the auction house whether its to 20k or 1Mill. So really, earning AD is not an issue. Me? I've played Neverwinter since Beta two years ago and have never spent a dime to get the cool items I desired. I just played the game and earned AD, which as stated before, isn't as hard as people say it to be. The point of playing a game is earning what you want and working towards your goal. But many are lazy and do not want to work for what they want. I also forgot to mention, if you really want something off the Zen market but have no desire to pay real life money for exclusive items on it, did you know you can trade AD for Zen? Isn't that nice that Neverwinter allows you to do that? They give you every option in the game to get what you want without paying a single cent. I don't know about you, but thats very nice, especially for a FREE game. In game events also happen often, and every event gives you a chance to get a very unique item of some kind whether its so a very cool fast mount, a strong companion, or just a silly item like a portable throne!\n\nNow lets talk about the workers behind Neverwinter that are really a great group of people. They constantly work hard daily to keep Neverwinter running, adding new content very often, and keeping it bug free. The employees are also very easy to get ahold of and they are the most helpful bunch that will assist you with anything you need. Its very important for a game to have that. They also play Neverwinter, and they even take the time to play with players in-game and occasionally help out people in need. How cool is that? They also Stream on Twitch often and give away in game items and even phsyical items like T-Shirts.\n\nSo overall, Neverwinter is one of the best free to play MMOs out right now. There's a reason I've been playing this game since beta. It even has an epic story line unlike many other MMOs that don't. Like everybody else, I skip dialog, I don't care, I just want to play. With Neverwinter, everything about it whether its to the lore or story line, is so very intriguing and makes you want to really understand whats going on and pay attention. Neverwinter is also very visually stunning and the amount of work and detail put into this game is really quite amazing. Don't believe me? Check out my screenshots and look at my Neverwinter ones. You'll also see that I have an epic mount, easily obtained by earning AD.\n\nLike MMORPGs? Want a game full of endless content you can spend countless hours on? Do you like Dungeons and Dragons? Then take the time to play Neverwinter ♥","September 14, 2014","true","280.1"," 25 of 48 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","25","48","0","5"

Most modern mmorpgs out there are stuck in a rut where everyone in the game is wearing the same armor to get the same stats because there no differences between classes, except for roles.\n\nThis game has so much to it. 40 hours of gameplay may get you close to that cap but you are far from done. The complexities of choosing the right moves(sorry infinite hotbar people) choosing the right stats, choosing the right gear, choosing the right abilities will keep you going in this game for a long time.\n\nComabt is hands down some the best an MMORPG has seen, improving upon the Guild Wars dodge mechanics. PvP is about more than seeing who can run the best circles and press the moves in a better faster rotation, there is actually some skill involved.

In this shop you can't buy any equipment but Wards, and you'll need those wards for your enchantments.\n\nAll in all i can say that I had fun playing this game and I will play it further because after every dungeon you finish, after every boss you kill and after every step you advance you make in the campaigns, you'll feel better and you can see how you develop your character.\nIf you have another opinion pls share it in the comments below.\nIt's a game worth a try because it's free2play :3","April 25, 2014","true","446.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To top that off, it's FREE. And though you'll begin very slowly, giving soldiers medkits and collecting broken arrows, the moment you expect a chore, you're fighting the Necromancer's chief in brute strength. From there, you can do anything you so choose, whether that be the plot line or discovering things you aren't supposed to yet.\nEvery class and race feels individual, as some races change the loadout of your class. It runs off the familiar Stats from DnD, Strangth, Dexterity, Charisma, Constitution, & Wisdom. These stats will effect anything you do. This game requires skill rather than good equipment, unlike WoW, in that you can sidestep and teleport (depending on your class) to escape attacks. You have to have full situational awareness though, because if one enemy can sneak up on you, you're gonna have a bad time.\nYou can quest with other people, which is fantastic and makes the game much more friendly than  other MMORPGs. There is even a mail system. And though some quests you do feel similar, you won't get bored of them. They never feel repetitive, although they sound like it.\n\nBottom line is, if you have hard drive space, good internet, and NEED something to keep you occupied for the rest of the year, this game is definately for you.","January 14, 2014","true","817.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Then you'll be sorely disappointed.\n\nI concluded very quickly that this title is Neverwinter in name alone, where the long since established D&D rule system and mechanics are no where in sight. Hence I didn't play for very long out of blinding disappointment. Instead of the second coming we get this weird mix of "modern" action orientated combat, apparently borrowing mechanics and ideas from a wide range of similar games and throwing them haphazardly into a boiling pot of lore loosely based on the beloved Neverwinter Nights games and D&D universe.\n\nWhere this game has a chance to shine though, is through it's surprisingly complex and complete quest creation system. There is a metric tonne of player created quests here (for better or worse)! Some are really well written and thought out while others are painfully incomplete and outright boring.\n\nWould I recommend it?\nIf you are familiar with the role of being a gamemaster or just love to create stories, this might just be the game for you.\nIf you are looking for yet another F2P MMO in which to kill things, this might be the game for you.\nIf you are looking for a solid Neverwinter Nights/D&D experience... keep looking.\n\nTL;DR: Leave your love and expectations of D&D at the door and you should be fine.","February 26, 2014","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Check this and you will see why http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn57m5X7HYw\n\nSo. This game is one of the most epick MMORPG's out there. It has a greate sistem and a lot of content.\n\nMe miself i like to play FPS's like TF2, Tribes: Ascend, CoD: BO2 and so on. Buth i take a brake and i get into this. A open world game, and really fun to play by yourself or with friends. When it was in beta it came out good, buth now it is just a complete sistem of playing for fun. No money nedded to be spended and if you will have a "thing" for this game go check out the guy whos link to a dicusion i sended. He will teach youa nd show you a lot more than i will (no that guy is not me).\n\nSo if you really like World of Warcraft and games like that, this is the best thing you will come by. I would play WoW, buth spending 5-10 euros a month just so i can become higher level than 20 its just too much. Now this game is rare also in this: Economy. It has a greate economy and it works like TF2 Tradeing. You can exchange your in game money (dimonds) for Zen (currency to buy with money).\n\nOwerall the only thing id sead that is wrong is that not a lot of people know this game. Belive me you will maybe not like it a first... Buth after some days (just to brake the ice) you will fall in love with it.\n\nGreate game if you are bored and if you are not bored. PvP, dungeon raids, and manny more is in it. Go now download it, put a like on this game and start playing.","July 16, 2014","true","25.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

ZEN is a currency you can buy with real money. You can convert ZEN into Astral Diamonds or do the opposite - AD into ZEN. AD can be achieved by doing daily quests and is the trading currency used in the Auction House and several merchants. You can buy ZEN to quicken your progression or make the game more convenient(e.g. extra inventory slots, respec tokens, rare companions and more). ZEN converted into AD can get you rare and powerful items from the Auction House.\nOnly difference a paying user could have, is if he bought a Starter pack or Guardian of Neverwinter pack and he would receive exclusive gear, mounts/companions, enchants. They barely affect gameplay and only have vanity value, rather than becoming stronger.\nAll content is the same either you're a paying user or a free user, it depends on how much are you willing to grind. You can grind to get AD and then trade it for something you want. Or be a bit more patient and do daily quests and sell unwanted stuff in the Auction house.\nProffessions are a grind fest and work based of timers. You need a certain leveled/valued worker, reagents and time. Most proffesions have task times of 10-60minutes. Leadership on the other hand has 2-12hours. You can access proffesions from your browser/mobile device so if you're really determined you can progress in proffesions nicely.\nNeverwinter is worth a try, for a free-to-play mmo this one is indeed special.","May 15, 2014","true","186.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Avoiding the cliche of choosing "Baldur's Gate" or "Planescape" I opted for a lesser known region of which I've already forgetten the name of.\n\nAfter your selection the game, of course, carries you to the Sword Coast and dumps you smack dab in the middle of Neverwinter. Icewind Dale is there too as a secondary campaign once you've toodely-deed so far through the main romp. On the far side of Neverwinter's main area there is a crew lining up for an exodus to the arctic content but the ship captain will bluntly tell you to come back much later when you're less of a family man.\n\nIf you're looking for a challenging single player experience with hefty reflex action combat; NW has strategically placed only a small number of hot keys around the WASD area and you can trip several of them at a time.\nMixed with your shift key, space bar and mouse it's just as finger frenzy as the more action-oriented console games.\n\nDespite NW's choice to only focus on the Sword Coast and all overland travel is handled by fast traveling from a static overhead map - Each individual area is huge and some of the areas are laden in secrets, side quests and dungeons.\n\nI've had nearly thirty hours of quality entertainment so far and haven't spent a dime but there are some massive cash grabs going on - not so much that they are needed to progress but when players gallop by on invisible horses, and plow through crowds with mechanical bulls and spiders you realize that the REALLY interesting material pushing NW far beyond a Triple A game is going to cost your time or your wallet.\n\nTime? Yes, apparently everything that can be purchased for real cash can 'techincally' be purchased with Astral Diamonds but good luck finding many people storing, let alone offering to sell, their hard earned Zen.  There is a AD exchange for Zen always selectable from the menu along the top of your screen but seldom have I seen other players auctioning their Zen. Neverwinters management doesn't offer it at a base rate themselves so it's up to the players if they want to put real money up for grabs for more 'play' money. Hmm...\n\nBut as I've said - I've had more fun in this game for free than most games I've bought over the years for $30 a piece and the material I've got left and overworld map to open up looks nearly endless.\n\nAll said and done however NW's fun for me lies in the challenge and suprise of uncovering secrets on on your own - especially doing solo raids. The challenge is balanced perfectly to give a lone wolf like myself a hard time without it becoming unfair. I can easily compare the expperience to the lone wolf challenges in Warframe where it really seemed the game was loading it on heavier to try and choke up your wallet out of frustration but when you socked it to the A.I. you were all like "YEAH! IN YOUR FACE YOU BLODDY DRIPPING ****!!"\n\nI can only imagine having played the previous dungeons with several others and it would've been a total clean-up (especially if the other players were higher level) in those instances the experience might possibly reduce itself to another MMO where everyone stands around chatting in a theme park showing off the funny virtual clothes they bankrupted their parents for.","February 25, 2015","true","36.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

This game, however, is pretty good and fun to play, especially if you have a friend or two to create party with and explore the world together.

Check this and you will see why http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn57m5X7HYw\n\nSo. This game is one of the most epick MMORPG's out there. It has a greate sistem and a lot of content.\n\nMe miself i like to play FPS's like TF2, Tribes: Ascend, CoD: BO2 and so on. Buth i take a brake and i get into this. A open world game, and really fun to play by yourself or with friends. When it was in beta it came out good, buth now it is just a complete sistem of playing for fun. No money nedded to be spended and if you will have a "thing" for this game go check out the guy whos link to a dicusion i sended. He will teach youa nd show you a lot more than i will (no that guy is not me).\n\nSo if you really like World of Warcraft and games like that, this is the best thing you will come by. I would play WoW, buth spending 5-10 euros a month just so i can become higher level than 20 its just too much. Now this game is rare also in this: Economy. It has a greate economy and it works like TF2 Tradeing. You can exchange your in game money (dimonds) for Zen (currency to buy with money).\n\nOwerall the only thing id sead that is wrong is that not a lot of people know this game. Belive me you will maybe not like it a first... Buth after some days (just to brake the ice) you will fall in love with it.\n\nGreate game if you are bored and if you are not bored. PvP, dungeon raids, and manny more is in it. Go now download it, put a like on this game and start playing.","July 16, 2014","true","25.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To top that off, it's FREE. And though you'll begin very slowly, giving soldiers medkits and collecting broken arrows, the moment you expect a chore, you're fighting the Necromancer's chief in brute strength. From there, you can do anything you so choose, whether that be the plot line or discovering things you aren't supposed to yet.\nEvery class and race feels individual, as some races change the loadout of your class. It runs off the familiar Stats from DnD, Strangth, Dexterity, Charisma, Constitution, & Wisdom. These stats will effect anything you do. This game requires skill rather than good equipment, unlike WoW, in that you can sidestep and teleport (depending on your class) to escape attacks. You have to have full situational awareness though, because if one enemy can sneak up on you, you're gonna have a bad time.\nYou can quest with other people, which is fantastic and makes the game much more friendly than  other MMORPGs. There is even a mail system. And though some quests you do feel similar, you won't get bored of them. They never feel repetitive, although they sound like it.\n\nBottom line is, if you have hard drive space, good internet, and NEED something to keep you occupied for the rest of the year, this game is definately for you.","January 14, 2014","true","817.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

In this shop you can't buy any equipment but Wards, and you'll need those wards for your enchantments.\n\nAll in all i can say that I had fun playing this game and I will play it further because after every dungeon you finish, after every boss you kill and after every step you advance you make in the campaigns, you'll feel better and you can see how you develop your character.\nIf you have another opinion pls share it in the comments below.\nIt's a game worth a try because it's free2play :3","April 25, 2014","true","446.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some of what it has to offer is pretty cool and even useful. But the pricing really sucks. If you really want to get the cool stuff, or even just buy a handful of things that make the game a bit better or more fun, then expect to pay for it. A decent mount? $15-20. A cool companion? $5-20. 10 keys that can only be bought with real money? $11.50 Oh- and the chests they open may have some really cool stuff but dont expect to get it without opening 50+.

There are some cool items that you can get by paying, but mostly, they just look cool, or are unique, but in no way "win" the game for you. There's about 30 hours of great storyline in the PvE, but then the end-game gets quite "grindish", with only small gains in items or skills to get out of it. PvP is limited to an arena game, similar to most arena PvP games, but definitely takes some in-game focus to get good, especially at cap where the the early level 60 players are up against those with months of gear advantage.\n\nOne favorite of mine is that the "for purchase" currency (zen) is available to trade on an in-game market for the "earned" currency (astral diamonds), which helps make even pay items available to non-paying characters without using sketchy outside markets.","February 1, 2014","true","387.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's 4th edition mechanics as they were meant to be enjoyed, digitally.  It's a solid game for the most part, but the business model, and endgame inbalance means I can't fully recommend it.

The first one is mouth animations and head movements seem waaaaaaaaayyyy unrealistic and inhuman. They need to make the npc's talking more life like but hey just look like robots opening they're mouths. I know this can be done without much effort, its just time consuming to make a bunch of new face and head animations. Lazy.\n\nNext is the peformance of the game which i may say is terrible considering the graphics in the game are mid ranged. I understand that its a mmorpg and they're are other players in the game and tons of models running around should boggle down my system but seriously the lvls where they're are only enemies and npc's should run smoothly but they don't. There needs to be better optimization of the video cards that work with the game im talking about AMD and ATI cards.\n\nI have two cards on 2 different systems my nvidia 640 works well but my ati 4850 which by the way is faster and better performing then the recommended 2900 gt runs wayyyyy slow. Thats a no no.\n\nLast probably something I havent figured out on the controls but attack dash or whatever you call it should bigger or maybe im missing something i just need to customize it because as you get to higher lvls you get more skills and I want to be able to use ALL my skills not the juts 3 on my action dash. Lame.\n\nDon't let me start on Qeue for dungeons cause its hella annoying sitting there for like 2 hours so that 1 person would join instead of spamming the LFG channel to get someone to party with you to do a dungie. I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY WHEN IM QEUE FOR DUGEONS AND FOR A SPECIFIC ONE everyone in the channel is LFG for that same dungeon. We shouldn't have beg other players to be like hey man wanna do a dungeon. Or you message someone whos been spamming the channel and they tell you that they already have people its just annoying and inconsistent.

I bought the Dragon expansion a mount a companion and a few other things and realised even then i was nowhere i end up spending 80 pound to hit another platau and before i could even get to where most of my clan where the game would have expected me to pay 200 - 500 pounds.\n\nThe game is infact VERRYYY expencive and it tries to hook you in with the first buy then you think ohh i cant go back now just no its a game with no real replayability unless your willing to spend a fortune.

The posts they don't delete should give you a good idea of what your in for.\n","December 20, 2015","false","108.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is beyond my understanding how the game developers could have gotten away with just 1 (in words: one) music loop in the main city all those years. Controls are clumsy. Pvp is terrible. While it is called ftp, I hardly have seen anything more demanding your money.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CZD/recommended/109600/","CZD","Casval Zem Daikun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CZD/","15 products in account","I've played this game a few months after it originally launched on PC and ended up quitting several times for the same reason. I'll break this down into categories: (tl;dr located at bottom)\n\n\nItemizing\n+ Equipment isn't too hard to get. However, in the latest versions, the gear choices are a lot more static than they used to be. Doesn't offer too much customization.\n- Enchants are broken beyond belief. Getting the required amount of shards for Weapon/Armor enchants isn't hard. However, they all have a 1% chance to succeed. Forcing you to either grind and play a ridiculously unfair game of RNG or simply invest into the cash shop. Normal enchants aren't too much of a pain until you get them to Lvl 7, then they get very expensive and the success rates plummet.\n- Legendary weapons, while good in idea, have been ruined in multiple ways. Refinement Point Items (RP Items) used to be a lot more common than they are now. However, botters started farming them and flooded the market with them which effectively reduced the price of the items and made them available for everyone. However, Cryptic decided to make RP items bound when picked up which effectively destroyed the market. As a result, RP items are too expensive, the game doesn't offer a lot of money making possibilities, and the legendary weapons cost too much to upgrade\n- Legendary Armor/Accessories. Once again, completely imbalanced. In the current state of the game, there are many options to choose from but only about 3 that are viable and worth upgrading. The community has been very vocal about this and nothing has been done about it. The only improvements are obvious bugs with some of the sets have been corrected.\n\n\nClass Design\n- Many of the classes have serious problems with some or all of their Paragon Paths or skills. Hunter Rangers, for example, all typically resort to the game Paragon Path and the same Feat Path because the other two are underperforming or riddled with bugs. Scourge Warlocks suffer the same thing. Trickster Rogues also have a broken Paragon Path. There are too many classes that have had problems (some spanning years in the making) that have not been acknowledged or fixed\n+ For the sake of it, each class does bring something different to the table. The difference between a GWF and GF are very obvious. CW vs SW is also a very different kit. How these affect the game is a different story\n\nUI and Game Mechanics\n+ The game separates itself from a typical MMO by limiting the number of active skills and redefining how passive skills work. Unlike a game like FFXIV, which has a ton of hotbars, Neverwinter limits you to 2 At-Wills, 3 Encounters, and 2 Daily Powers. Also, unlike most conventional MMOs, NW requires you to equip the passive you want to use instead of it being active at all times. You're limited to 2 active passive skills at a time.\n+ The User Interface is pretty simple and easy to navigate. It's intuitive and does what it needs to. Each menu in the game serves its own purpose and lots of tooltips are available.\n- This may be a personal problem but I would prefer if the skills had some sort of scaling formula on them to show how stats, equipment, and buffs affect the output of the skill.\n- Many options for Encounters, Dailies, At-Wills, and Passives do not serve any sort of purpose in any part of the game. This is part of Class Design.\n- The Matchmaking system for PvP and PvE is completely broken. PvE matchmaking does not respect any kind of party composition, so it's entirely possible to be matched into a party with 5 DPS and no heal/tank class. The same applies to PvP. Healing classes in PvP are an asset, so instead of evenly dividing classes between two teams, it's entirely possible for 5 DPS to be matched against 5 Healers which typically results in a permanent stalemate.\n\n\nPvE Mechanics\n+/- Previously, the game had a very respectable array of dungeons and skirmishes to choose from, both for leveling and endgame. Module 7 removed all but a handful of these and they still have not re-added all of the previously removed content which makes it very dull. However, for the instances they did re-add, their difficulties have been scaled up.\n+/- The item level requirements on endgame dungeons are incredibly misleading. Unlike, for instance, Tera, which scales its requirements on the general level of equipment you should have to attempt an instance, NW's requirements do not follow any sort of meaningful logic. iLvl can be inflated in a variety of ways and, as previously stated, the Matchmaking system does not allow viable party composition. Also noteworthy is that because iLvl can be inflated, someone with the iLvl to enter the instance can end up doing worse than someone who does not meet the requirements\n- The biggest problem with PvE content is also tied into class designs. Some classes underperform in PvE compared to all of their competitors. For instance, the difference between CW and SW. CW brings some modicum of Crowd Control to the party as well as DPS. SW brings comparable, if not lower, DPS and no Crowd Control. This leaves to very static party comps that do not accept certain classes.\n- The money-making possibilities from PvE activities are absurdly low. Given the price of RP items, enchantments, companions, etc, the rewards from PvE are ridiculously low and capped per day at an abysmally low amount. Furthermore, most of the equipment gained from dungeons is bound so it can't be traded for money anyway.\n+/- Two different currencies exist in Neverwinter: Astral Diamonds and Gold. Gold is pretty useless, only good for buying some consumables from NPCs (You'll typically only buy Injury Kits) and the starter mounts. Astral Diamonds (AD, henceforth) is used for literally everything else.\n\n\nPvP\n- PvP activities are very static. Of all of the PvP maps and modes available, none of them are based on actual PvP (Similar to TDM, DM, Assassination, etc). They're all based on point capture. The two IWD Zones only turn into capture maps during the Heroic Encounter that spawns at certain times of the day, however, these zones are usually very barren.\n- Very few improvements have been made to the PvP modes since the game was originally launched.\n- Some classes outperform other classes in every regard. For instance, and yet again, a CW is much more of an asset than a SW. A GF, the dedicated tanking class, has comparable DPS abilities to a GWF, the heavy weapon class. Some classes, once upgraded to a certain point, are effectively immortal when under focus fire from a group. Put simply, the class balance in PvP does not exist.\n- A lot of class balancing decisions are made from PvP-based feedback. For instance, Combat HRs were complained about for a long time. They weren't amazing in PvE either. As a result of the PvP feedback, the Combat spec was nerfed. The same thing happened to Whisperknife TRs as well. Ironically, if you start from older mods (Mod 3-ish), you'll notice a certain trend in the devs' logic against nerfing a single class. Might be a conspiracy theory but it sure stands out.\n\n\n\ntl;dr:\nThe game has too many problems. Some classes are a complete waste of time due to bugs and underperforming compared to other classes which makes PvP more trouble than its worth and PvE a pain in the ♥♥♥. The game is hosted by a company that has no other desire than to make money. This is obvious when the developers ask for community feedback and after a 50 page thread of feedback, they completely disregard it and make nonsensical changes to the game that do not fix the problem.\n\nI would not recommend this game to anyone. Even someone I hate.","February 4","false","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is hyper repetative and somewhat glitchy.  As an illustration  I played a control mage, one of his more common abilities is moving enemies (generally throwing them away from himself), this quite often caused enemies to fly outside of the map boundaries forcing a restart of the area.  Even when working its not great though.  You basically walk down a corridor and numbers pop up all over the place, you sometimes go down into sewers instead of alleys where you fight functionally identical enemies.  Your abilities are either similar or do nothing, which combined with the fact there are very few abilities makes for an issue.\n\nAnd the quests are the one reasonable part of the game, but even that have issues.  Like I said earlier most if not all of the quests I got involved a "talk to the RMT" step.  And on top of that they are full of terrible writing, terrible acting (which is not even equalised properly so one character can be quiet as a whisper and the next eardrum burstingly loud) and beyond being XP sources dont really matter.\n\n\nI only got to lvl 20, which IIRC is about 1/3 of the way to the cap.  Maybe the gameplay becomes more interesting later on.  There was a whole gameplay mechanic of selectively applying buff/debuff stacks and abilities which benefit from specific stacks, but at least in the lower levels it is a ridiculous pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to do which gives no appreciable benefit.  That at least could get more interesting later on.","March 12","false","24.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

These packs should by no means be more than $10 for what you get in them. Zen is completely unjustifiable at its current price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CZD/recommended/109600/","CZD","Casval Zem Daikun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CZD/","15 products in account","I've played this game a few months after it originally launched on PC and ended up quitting several times for the same reason. I'll break this down into categories: (tl;dr located at bottom)\n\n\nItemizing\n+ Equipment isn't too hard to get. However, in the latest versions, the gear choices are a lot more static than they used to be. Doesn't offer too much customization.\n- Enchants are broken beyond belief. Getting the required amount of shards for Weapon/Armor enchants isn't hard. However, they all have a 1% chance to succeed. Forcing you to either grind and play a ridiculously unfair game of RNG or simply invest into the cash shop. Normal enchants aren't too much of a pain until you get them to Lvl 7, then they get very expensive and the success rates plummet.\n- Legendary weapons, while good in idea, have been ruined in multiple ways. Refinement Point Items (RP Items) used to be a lot more common than they are now. However, botters started farming them and flooded the market with them which effectively reduced the price of the items and made them available for everyone. However, Cryptic decided to make RP items bound when picked up which effectively destroyed the market. As a result, RP items are too expensive, the game doesn't offer a lot of money making possibilities, and the legendary weapons cost too much to upgrade\n- Legendary Armor/Accessories. Once again, completely imbalanced. In the current state of the game, there are many options to choose from but only about 3 that are viable and worth upgrading. The community has been very vocal about this and nothing has been done about it. The only improvements are obvious bugs with some of the sets have been corrected.\n\n\nClass Design\n- Many of the classes have serious problems with some or all of their Paragon Paths or skills. Hunter Rangers, for example, all typically resort to the game Paragon Path and the same Feat Path because the other two are underperforming or riddled with bugs. Scourge Warlocks suffer the same thing. Trickster Rogues also have a broken Paragon Path. There are too many classes that have had problems (some spanning years in the making) that have not been acknowledged or fixed\n+ For the sake of it, each class does bring something different to the table. The difference between a GWF and GF are very obvious. CW vs SW is also a very different kit. How these affect the game is a different story\n\nUI and Game Mechanics\n+ The game separates itself from a typical MMO by limiting the number of active skills and redefining how passive skills work. Unlike a game like FFXIV, which has a ton of hotbars, Neverwinter limits you to 2 At-Wills, 3 Encounters, and 2 Daily Powers. Also, unlike most conventional MMOs, NW requires you to equip the passive you want to use instead of it being active at all times. You're limited to 2 active passive skills at a time.\n+ The User Interface is pretty simple and easy to navigate. It's intuitive and does what it needs to. Each menu in the game serves its own purpose and lots of tooltips are available.\n- This may be a personal problem but I would prefer if the skills had some sort of scaling formula on them to show how stats, equipment, and buffs affect the output of the skill.\n- Many options for Encounters, Dailies, At-Wills, and Passives do not serve any sort of purpose in any part of the game. This is part of Class Design.\n- The Matchmaking system for PvP and PvE is completely broken. PvE matchmaking does not respect any kind of party composition, so it's entirely possible to be matched into a party with 5 DPS and no heal/tank class. The same applies to PvP. Healing classes in PvP are an asset, so instead of evenly dividing classes between two teams, it's entirely possible for 5 DPS to be matched against 5 Healers which typically results in a permanent stalemate.\n\n\nPvE Mechanics\n+/- Previously, the game had a very respectable array of dungeons and skirmishes to choose from, both for leveling and endgame. Module 7 removed all but a handful of these and they still have not re-added all of the previously removed content which makes it very dull. However, for the instances they did re-add, their difficulties have been scaled up.\n+/- The item level requirements on endgame dungeons are incredibly misleading. Unlike, for instance, Tera, which scales its requirements on the general level of equipment you should have to attempt an instance, NW's requirements do not follow any sort of meaningful logic. iLvl can be inflated in a variety of ways and, as previously stated, the Matchmaking system does not allow viable party composition. Also noteworthy is that because iLvl can be inflated, someone with the iLvl to enter the instance can end up doing worse than someone who does not meet the requirements\n- The biggest problem with PvE content is also tied into class designs. Some classes underperform in PvE compared to all of their competitors. For instance, the difference between CW and SW. CW brings some modicum of Crowd Control to the party as well as DPS. SW brings comparable, if not lower, DPS and no Crowd Control. This leaves to very static party comps that do not accept certain classes.\n- The money-making possibilities from PvE activities are absurdly low. Given the price of RP items, enchantments, companions, etc, the rewards from PvE are ridiculously low and capped per day at an abysmally low amount. Furthermore, most of the equipment gained from dungeons is bound so it can't be traded for money anyway.\n+/- Two different currencies exist in Neverwinter: Astral Diamonds and Gold. Gold is pretty useless, only good for buying some consumables from NPCs (You'll typically only buy Injury Kits) and the starter mounts. Astral Diamonds (AD, henceforth) is used for literally everything else.\n\n\nPvP\n- PvP activities are very static. Of all of the PvP maps and modes available, none of them are based on actual PvP (Similar to TDM, DM, Assassination, etc). They're all based on point capture. The two IWD Zones only turn into capture maps during the Heroic Encounter that spawns at certain times of the day, however, these zones are usually very barren.\n- Very few improvements have been made to the PvP modes since the game was originally launched.\n- Some classes outperform other classes in every regard. For instance, and yet again, a CW is much more of an asset than a SW. A GF, the dedicated tanking class, has comparable DPS abilities to a GWF, the heavy weapon class. Some classes, once upgraded to a certain point, are effectively immortal when under focus fire from a group. Put simply, the class balance in PvP does not exist.\n- A lot of class balancing decisions are made from PvP-based feedback. For instance, Combat HRs were complained about for a long time. They weren't amazing in PvE either. As a result of the PvP feedback, the Combat spec was nerfed. The same thing happened to Whisperknife TRs as well. Ironically, if you start from older mods (Mod 3-ish), you'll notice a certain trend in the devs' logic against nerfing a single class. Might be a conspiracy theory but it sure stands out.\n\n\n\ntl;dr:\nThe game has too many problems. Some classes are a complete waste of time due to bugs and underperforming compared to other classes which makes PvP more trouble than its worth and PvE a pain in the ♥♥♥. The game is hosted by a company that has no other desire than to make money. This is obvious when the developers ask for community feedback and after a 50 page thread of feedback, they completely disregard it and make nonsensical changes to the game that do not fix the problem.\n\nI would not recommend this game to anyone. Even someone I hate.","February 4","false","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Avoiding the cliche of choosing "Baldur's Gate" or "Planescape" I opted for a lesser known region of which I've already forgetten the name of.\n\nAfter your selection the game, of course, carries you to the Sword Coast and dumps you smack dab in the middle of Neverwinter. Icewind Dale is there too as a secondary campaign once you've toodely-deed so far through the main romp. On the far side of Neverwinter's main area there is a crew lining up for an exodus to the arctic content but the ship captain will bluntly tell you to come back much later when you're less of a family man.\n\nIf you're looking for a challenging single player experience with hefty reflex action combat; NW has strategically placed only a small number of hot keys around the WASD area and you can trip several of them at a time.\nMixed with your shift key, space bar and mouse it's just as finger frenzy as the more action-oriented console games.\n\nDespite NW's choice to only focus on the Sword Coast and all overland travel is handled by fast traveling from a static overhead map - Each individual area is huge and some of the areas are laden in secrets, side quests and dungeons.\n\nI've had nearly thirty hours of quality entertainment so far and haven't spent a dime but there are some massive cash grabs going on - not so much that they are needed to progress but when players gallop by on invisible horses, and plow through crowds with mechanical bulls and spiders you realize that the REALLY interesting material pushing NW far beyond a Triple A game is going to cost your time or your wallet.\n\nTime? Yes, apparently everything that can be purchased for real cash can 'techincally' be purchased with Astral Diamonds but good luck finding many people storing, let alone offering to sell, their hard earned Zen.  There is a AD exchange for Zen always selectable from the menu along the top of your screen but seldom have I seen other players auctioning their Zen. Neverwinters management doesn't offer it at a base rate themselves so it's up to the players if they want to put real money up for grabs for more 'play' money. Hmm...\n\nBut as I've said - I've had more fun in this game for free than most games I've bought over the years for $30 a piece and the material I've got left and overworld map to open up looks nearly endless.\n\nAll said and done however NW's fun for me lies in the challenge and suprise of uncovering secrets on on your own - especially doing solo raids. The challenge is balanced perfectly to give a lone wolf like myself a hard time without it becoming unfair. I can easily compare the expperience to the lone wolf challenges in Warframe where it really seemed the game was loading it on heavier to try and choke up your wallet out of frustration but when you socked it to the A.I. you were all like "YEAH! IN YOUR FACE YOU BLODDY DRIPPING ****!!"\n\nI can only imagine having played the previous dungeons with several others and it would've been a total clean-up (especially if the other players were higher level) in those instances the experience might possibly reduce itself to another MMO where everyone stands around chatting in a theme park showing off the funny virtual clothes they bankrupted their parents for.","February 25, 2015","true","36.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Honestly do have some problems, but there is no perfect mmo.\nMy Pros to the game.\n1.Character Creation. It was easy to understand, and I didnt find myself taking hours just to make my character look nice\n2.Graphics are great. the game doesnt look like your run of the mill averge rpg.\n3.leveling is fast and fun.\n4.Objectives of quest are most of the time clear.\n5.although i dont like class based skills, they where done quite well in this.\n6.PVP, This has its flaws and perfections\n7.The story is over all good\n8.levels are nicely done\n\n\n\n\n8.Many People have been saying this game is pay to play or pay to win........... allthough i can see how they can get the idea, but let me tell you what a pay to play its....... runescape, have you ever playied it? well i have you have to pay to unlock skills, map parts, armor, weapons, and many other things. this game is not pay to play by a long shot.... granted there are some things that are anoying examples... companion  upgrades.... character slots... and other things, but it still isnt pay to play because of astral diamonds. granted it takes time to get these it isnt imposible. u can get up to 3000-4000 a day just by doing pvp....................................................... or even more if u do dungeons  and other stuff........\nyou can also get them from profesions like leadership.... you log in click a few buttons set a task, do some pvp and bam u got u some astral........\n\n\nCons to this game.\n1. Skill tree: Some times i just look at my feets/ skill point and im like am i doing this right.\n2.i go through 20 levels and my armor looks like the same ♥♥♥♥ i had on at the boat crash like wat\n3.PVP. has some balancing to do\n4.sometimes i find myself lost on a level and im like what am i suppose to be doing again.\n5.the heck is up with the dlc's jesus\nAGAIN SORRY DIDNT CHECK FOR GRAMMER JUST TYPED SO yea...\n\n\nOver all this is a great game.","April 26, 2015","true","115.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

So far (lvl. 26) I haven't noticed any paywalls preventing F2P players from advancing . The game has a nice farming/grinding system to give F2P players some cool stuff. Overall, the game seems fair and is pretty fun. The questline is focused and doesn't branch out a lot, but this is not necessarily a bad thing because the quest givers are fully voiced and the quests offer more than just the typical "go there, collect/kill X of something", esspecialy towards the higher levels.

It's not what I expected.\n\nYou hear MMORPG and you think of a game based around using huge hotbars full of skills, but that's not waht you get here. It handles more like a 3rd person action game with a small selection of hotkeyed skills that you pick from a larger list of skills (you need to progress to unlock them).\n\nThe progression feels nicely handled, and combat is fluid. My only gripe with combat is that, at least on the Warlock I started with, you're rooted in place when you attack. This is bad because as a magic user, you're primarily a ranged class, so letting enemies get in close isn't a smart move. However this is somewhat typical of a lot of MMOs, and while it's a bugbear of mine and I'd prefer it to not happen, I've sort of grown used to it from when I played TERA. Enemies in some areas also respwan fairly quickly. I see this as both being good and bad; Good because it mean there's a lot of mobs to kill so all the players in an area can get some kills, and Bad because if you're doing a fetch quest, you have to fight the same mobs over and over again going to and from the objective.\n\nThe economy, specifically buying things and vendors, is confusing at first. The map has a ton of icons specific to what each store does... but it doesn't tell you what means what, so you're left to wander the city map trying to find a place to buy armor and weapons (if you even can, because I couldn't find the right vendor).\n\nI hear people say there's P2W in the crafting. And there might be, but I haven't gone into crafting at all so I wouldn't know. What I will say is this; early impressions of this game are positive. The classes are distinct from each other and play different roles in combat.

This allows us to predict two things:\n1. The amount of cash required will be huge.\n2. The classes will be split into the usual healer\tank\damage-dealer arch-types.\n\nStarting out, you'll get to pick your race between all the usual D&D races, and have a choice of class. This confirms suspicion #2 in that there is the "Devout Cleric" (healer) "Guardian Fighter" (tank) and a bunch of other classes (damage-dealers).\nYou'll have an option between the "Control Wizard" which deals a lot of damage from a distance, has the ability to crowd-control multiple enemies, throw enemies off cliffs (which is invaluable at high-level dungeons, as it's an instant-kill) and is very very squishy. The main job of this class (apart from throwing enemies off ledges) is to keep the adds controlled while the tank kites and the rogue attacks the boss.\nThe "Great Weapons Fighter" which is a berserker with a two-handed weapon. Standard front-line damage-dealer. This class can either target the boss or the adds, depending on equipment and the specific boss in question.\nThe "Trickster Rogue" who relies on stealth for solo-play and does single-target damage in dungeons. This class's main job is to kill the bosses.\nThe "Hunter Ranger" who, frankly, has the most interesting combat as he has twice as many attacks. Appears to be a hybrid of the rogue and the wizard. The hunter ranger is able to switch between melee and ranged stance at any time, and each of his skills behaves differently depending on which stance he uses. The skills also have separate cooldowns for each of the stances.\n\nCombat is simple in this game: you have two "At Will" attacks (much akin to auto-attacks) which are bound to the left and right mouse buttons by default. Those do not have cooldown, though they can have charges.\nYou then have three "Encounter" skills, which are basically active skills. Mapped to QER by default.\nLastly, you have a "Daily" power, which is a horrible name for it since you can use it pretty often; the skills require a certain amount of "Action Points" which are gained by doing class-specific tasks. Healers heal, damage-dealers deal damage and I assume tanks block or absorb damage (though I haven't made one to confirm it). These could be considered your ultimate attacks and are bound to 1 and 2 by default.\n\nThere's the "Feat" system, which is basically passive bonuses for your character.\n\nAnd then there's the  two "Active passives" slots; those are skills that give you passive benefits, but are not "Feats" (meaning they take your active skillpoints rather than your feat points, and you can only have two of those at a time) you activate them by dragging them to your skill bar.\n\nYou can have more skills, but those are the most you can have useable at any one time.\n\nEquipment is your standard MMO system; five rarity levels, which are (in order):\n-White "Common" basic equipment.\n-Green "Uncommon" equipment.\n-Blue "Rare" equipment.\n-Purple "Epic" equipment.\n-Orange (?).\nPurple equipment is also split into tiers; tier one is obtained from the basic level 60 dungeons, while tier 2 is obtained from more difficult level 60 dungeons.\n\nSo far, so standard. Where this all comes crashing down is the enchantment system; each piece of equipment can have an enchantment inserted into it (something like sockets in Diablo), and those have several ranks. You can refine those enchantments to get higher ranks, and the success rate drops the higher the rank you attempt to refine - up to a 1% success rate at level 8 (rank 10 is the highest).\nIf you spend real money, you can guarantee the refinement process will succeed.\nWell, this validates my original assumption that the game will require lots of money - but let's pretend it doesn't and go on.\n\nI should probably mention the "Artifact" system. These are items that you can equip up to three of (one primary and two secondaries) which you can refine like the enchantment stones. Like the enchantment stones, you will need the item bought with real money to actually succeed in the refinement process. The primary artifact grants you an active ability and some stats, while the secondary artifacts only grant you the stats.\nEach player gets one at level 21 in a "Bind on Equip" state, though they have been known to bug out and bind even without equip. This bug appears to be unique to the artifacts.\n\nThe game features a companion system. Free players get a white one, which can reach rank 15 (equivalent to player level 30). For 25$, you can get a purple rarity one which can reach rank 30 (equivalent to player level 60).\n\nBag space is, of course, limited; in order to increase it, players must pay real money. The large bag costs (24 slots) 10$.\nStorage space is likewise limited, and more storage slots can be bought for real money.\n\nPvP exists, but there's no real match-making system in place to ensure the matches are fun or balanced; it's a fairly common sight to see one player kill five alone simply because his equipment is better.\nOne-hit-kills are fairly frequent.\n\nStory-wise, there isn't that much there; it would appear R.A. Salvatore wrote the begining, then the lore, then the new campaigns and then left. The entire mid-game forward you'll just be cleaning up random disasters that happen in and around the city.\nThe writing is what you can expect from Salvatore; your enemies are more evil than the combination of Satan and Hitler, while you are playing as the pure-good hero who can't even take items from a backpack without the appropriate skill (for rogues) or kit (items that will clutter up your inventory).\n\nThe "Campaigns" which I mentioned are set in zones just like every other part of the game. Unlike other parts of the game, they revolve around daily quests, which give you unique currency that you can then spend to progress in the campaign. Campaign rewards are mostly passive stat bonuses to your character (which require Astral Diamonds - read on for those) and access to two end-game instances with some of the best equipment.\nUnfortunately, the number of days you will have to spend before you actually unlock all of the passive bonuses is rather depressingly high, which will hurt new players who want to PvP.\n\nAnd, of course, I saved the worst for last: the game features a currency called "Astral Diamonds". You receive this currency from various daily tasks (playing player-created content, completing dungeons, playing in PvP) in a "rough" form, and must refine them in order to use them. The currency is gated at a refinement of twenty-four thousand a day (a very small amount) for free users, but players can trade real money for more.\nAstral Diamonds is used to buy various useful items, vanity items, new companions, new mounts, upgrade the rarity level of a companion (from white to green, or green to blue, or blue to purple) or a mount (same as the companion), as well as unlock several passive stat bonuses for your character (from the campaign quests).\n\nNow, the amounts of this currency required for each of those actions is rather staggering. It costs three hundred thousand to upgrade a companion from white to green. That is an amount free players will not get before reaching the level-cap unless you sell your artifact. You can get another one, if you create a new character and raise it to level twenty one or if you pay real money for an artifact pack.\n\nTo top all of this off, the game is riddled with bugs (geometry bugs, item bind bugs, enemy behavior, skill behavior etc) and the now-infamous Perfect World Entertainment Support is just worthless.\n\nSo, over-all, would I recommand this game?\nWell, if you have an insupressable need to empty the contents of your wallet, by all means - go ahead and indulge in this extremely pay-to-win experience.\nOtherwise, no, I'm afraid I can't recommand it.","December 10, 2013","false","254.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KaRraKas/recommended/109600/","KaRraKas","KaRraKas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KaRraKas/","67 products in account","Neverwinter is a game that has me halting between to opinions. There are some really good parts about this game, but also some not so good or just plain bad. Let's start of on a positive note.\n\nThe good!:\n\nIt is a really fun MMORPG with a cool and dynamic combat system that makes you dodge, run around and use your abilities without them having very long cooldowns. This, in combination with the relatively easy and straigthforward quests, makes you feel like a god amongst men. Hacking and slashing your way through clearly inferior enemies with awesome attacks and skills that are animated beatifully gives a cool kick. I don't mind the easy quests either. They'll take you to a wide variety of area's and dungeons, really making you feel like a badass adventurer.\n\nThe gear in the game is absolutely beautiful, which for me is very important. It does matter a bit if you are wearing a "set" of armor that makes all the pieces look good together. But even when leveling up and wearing rags the gear looks very cool.\n\nThe not so good:\n\nAs a casual gamer myself and trying to do some endgame a few flaws in the game come to the surface. The endgame dungeons are buggy as hell. If you do not have a guild or a full party that you can run dungeons with you are bound to use the game's queuing system (which works quite well actually). More often than not you will find yourself on a long dragging dungeon attempt that is usually about trying to exploit the dungeon's bugs in order to skip as many enemies as possible with people that don't seem to care if you die or not. None of the enemies really have any cool game mechanics, they just hit harder or faster than the last guy. I havent really had any boss fights that I found intriguing. Some of them were hard, yes. But that was just due to the enemy having a ridiculous amount of hitpoint and/or hitting very hard. I have not really had any fun in endgame dungeons yet.\n\nThe bad:\n\nThe game is published by Perfect world which isn't necessarily a bad thing at all. The game of course is Free To Play, which means that Perfect World will have you try to spend money on it at every turn you take (or atleast that is how I feel) because they have to make money somehow. The game has two main currencies : Astral diamonds and Zen. Both of these currencies can be traded for one another.\nAlmost all the epic gear in the game is Bind on Equip, which means that you can buy all of this gear for enormous amounts of diamonds. For people playing this game full time it is not a problem getting this gear and selling it, but for the casual gamer it can be frustrating to get to these incredible amounts of diamonds without spending any money on it.\nI guess this all makes perfect sense for someone who is at peace with this system and will probably go "yeah, so what?". For me it is really an uncool feeling. I feel that the best gear in the game should only be available for the ones who have completed certain content and have really earned it. For me this feels like Pay to Win.\nCombine this with the buggy endgame dungeons and the games endgame feels like a letdown.\nBesides that, the game makes you pay ridiculous amounts for what I call "comfort items". Items you do not need to complete the game but make your life ingame so much more easy. Things like a big bag (8 euro's in Zen!!) and fasts mounths (40 euro's in Zen!!) are just incredibly overpriced. These are not microtransactions but you end up paying as much for a fast mount as you would for a legal copy of Guild wars 2 during it's release. Just plain robbery. Of course you can always farm the required diamonds ingame but for a casual gamer that isn't really an option.\n\nAll in all it looks like Perfect World is trying to benefit from the casual gamer with a job that has no time to play the game full time but has plenty of money to spend on it. Since I am in that categoty I feel a bit exploited by the game.\n\nMy advice!:\n\nGo play Neverwinter! The combat system and the cool area's will give you much fun leveling up. The game really feels complete with cool loot drops and giving you new gear almost every level you gain.\n\nThink twice about really endgaming Neverwinter. The endgame dungeon's are buggy and hard for casuals. The game feels really repetative after spending some time at the max level.\n\nRating:\n\n+Cool Combat system\n+Feel like a god amongt men\n+Nice area, plenty to explore\n+Very cool skills/attacks and animations for all characters\n\n-Everything for sale\n-Hard for casuals to farm enough diamonds\n-Feels like pay to win sometimes\n-Comfort items really expensive\n-Buggy and repetative endgame\n\nAll in all I would score this MMORPG 7 out of 10.\n\nGive it a try!","January 5, 2014","true","75.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It gives the game an easy feel, with little need for teamwork, just button mashing. You dont need allot of skill to play, just either allot of time, or more commonly, money.\n\nIt's still good fun, it's just this game doesnt go anywhere, there is no sense of accomplishment. You will reach a point where you dont want to pay real money for next upgrade, and the time to get it by grinding dungeons/mobs/trading is just too great to be considered worthwhile or at the very least, enjoyable.","December 9, 2014","true","458.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/codex14/recommended/109600/","codex14","Codex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/codex14/","6 products in account","Model (F2P): The biggest downside to the game is its Zen system which, I suppose is the only way for a free MMO to make money, as one would expect from a F2P model. Unlike in games like Path of Exile, the items purchased with Zen can definitely be game altering and offer advantages that free players would not have access to at a much earlier level. However, there is a way to convert in game currency (Astral Diamonds) into Zen at a conversion rate that changes depending on the market. Neverwinter sometimes pushes the player to use special currencies in order to open lockboxes containing level-appropriate equipment, but is otherwise not too intrusive. Unfortunately, the in-game currency of Zen-to-Dollar ratio uses an extremely expensive conversion when compared to other F2P games such as Rift. While most decent item sets cost somewhere between 1500-3000 zen, approximately 500 zen = $5, depending on how many Zen are purchased at once.\n\nGameplay: Some of the most innovative and fun combat you'll find in the current MMO scene. The classes are very well fleshed-out, but definitely not balanced as of yet. Most classes require re-positioning, timing, and anticipation when reacting to enemies or even allies' actions. It's definitely not a click and spam blindly game. Unique mechanics are introduced depending on the class. A Guardian Fighter can hold up a shield to block attacks, while a Rogue can quickly close distance with a teleporting strike. Every class feels truly unique and full of flavor. The combat system is mostly based on a D&D-type of ruleset with skilltrees in the form of feats and eventual specialization. While questing is very linear and everything else is pretty much what you would expect in a standard MMO, the profession system is more of a que-and-wait.  Overall I would recommend this game to anyone who's awaiting WildStar and its combat system and wants something similar to satisfy their hunger for ARPG-type combat. Additionally, creative minds can use this game to create scenario-type quests and dungeons through a feature I personally have not used much called the Foundry.\n\nMultiplayer: Standard faire for the current MMO market. PVP scenarios of varying types pitting 5v5, co-op challenges that can quickly be completed with friends or random players, and dungeons. Lots of variety for all types of players and a guild system. Most players use the in-game chat to find groups or members. No innovation, but definitely satisfying for those who don't like soloing.\n\n7.5/10","January 20, 2014","true","9.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ximenes/recommended/109600/","ximenes","Naked Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ximenes/","220 products in account","I will give this game credit. It's not what I expected.\n\nYou hear MMORPG and you think of a game based around using huge hotbars full of skills, but that's not waht you get here. It handles more like a 3rd person action game with a small selection of hotkeyed skills that you pick from a larger list of skills (you need to progress to unlock them).\n\nThe progression feels nicely handled, and combat is fluid. My only gripe with combat is that, at least on the Warlock I started with, you're rooted in place when you attack. This is bad because as a magic user, you're primarily a ranged class, so letting enemies get in close isn't a smart move. However this is somewhat typical of a lot of MMOs, and while it's a bugbear of mine and I'd prefer it to not happen, I've sort of grown used to it from when I played TERA. Enemies in some areas also respwan fairly quickly. I see this as both being good and bad; Good because it mean there's a lot of mobs to kill so all the players in an area can get some kills, and Bad because if you're doing a fetch quest, you have to fight the same mobs over and over again going to and from the objective.\n\nThe economy, specifically buying things and vendors, is confusing at first. The map has a ton of icons specific to what each store does... but it doesn't tell you what means what, so you're left to wander the city map trying to find a place to buy armor and weapons (if you even can, because I couldn't find the right vendor).\n\nI hear people say there's P2W in the crafting. And there might be, but I haven't gone into crafting at all so I wouldn't know. What I will say is this; early impressions of this game are positive. The classes are distinct from each other and play different roles in combat. Character creation is straightforward (thought I'd have liked more customization options for the character other than face and body-type) and I'll probably end up sinking a decent amount of time into this game. Your milage may vary, but as a F2P game, what do you ahve to lose other than some time?","September 21, 2014","true","4.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It gives the game an easy feel, with little need for teamwork, just button mashing. You dont need allot of skill to play, just either allot of time, or more commonly, money.\n\nIt's still good fun, it's just this game doesnt go anywhere, there is no sense of accomplishment. You will reach a point where you dont want to pay real money for next upgrade, and the time to get it by grinding dungeons/mobs/trading is just too great to be considered worthwhile or at the very least, enjoyable.","December 9, 2014","true","458.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Then again, not alot of other MMORPG's are blessed to have a "good" publisher.\n\nEdit: I think i wrote that late at night after I closed neverwinter for the last time. I wanted to emphasise the importance of mmo publishers to actively play their games. Perfect World Entertainment's attitude to critical problems with the game was simply to ignore them and publish new redundent and convoluting content. Eventually, the lore was a mess, ingame economy lay in ruins, and character progression rendered as a sad emulation to World of Warcraft.\n\nThe only saving grace to this IP would be the control and combat mechanic. It's actually really intuitive and feels incredibly natural during PvP. Even with lag, the whole concept kept the feeling of control over my character in the game. Targeting with my mouse reticule is the future for mmos; tab targeting is you fighting the GUI before the GAME itself.\n\nI was going to play another game that has similar control/combat mechanic (Black Desert Online) but that is also FTP.

Lot's of the exploited currency was not removed and impact this game to this day. Many exploiters were not banned and run in Best in Slot items without any penalty.\n- Real money means very little (unless you can spend several thousand of $ on a game). Basically if you would want to get full BIS gear you'd need like ~2k of real $.\n- Bugs take months to get fixed (if they even bother to fix them in the first place)\n- Lot's of Overpowered items which come from Lockboxes. (sadly this game is not living on cosmetics stuff like Dota 2)\n- Several end game instances is often nearly unplayable due to server lags.\n- Very poor Class Balance\n- Extremely poor PvP balance (for example, you can move your Best in slot enchant from your high lvl character to a totaly low lvl character and use it in pvp because it have no min. lvl required) - I think i dont have to explain how much impact it have. Even at max lvl pvp there's insane gear gap between players.\n- Refiling system - pretty much pay to win feature. It makes all your gear useless so you have to spend lot's of real $ to get nearly BIS or BIS gear or pray to get lucky with some extremely rare drops.\n- This game does very little to reduce the gap between old and new players.

If youre thinking of the end game before playing it, just try it out (its free)\nThe combat was innovative as it came before ES:O, and the combo and action combat makes  for a more action orriented experience from an MMO.  I actually had fun grinding my way to the top, because of the active dodgeing and combos with varying AOE, I was thrilled to take on 4 enemies at once by being agile (certain classes block instead). That being said, the Skills are somewhat limited, but they have modifiers to help add to the customization.  So while Wizard 1 may have the same skills as Wizard 2, their modifiers could make them more pure damage or pure control, or somewhere in between.\n\nAs for everyone complaining of the prices for mounts, companions, etc, Ill say this: All these things (ALL OF THEM) can be purchased on the AH for Astral Diamonds which you get from playing.  IT IS CHEAPER to buy $5 of Zen Coin and convert to diamonds, because a top tier companion is a lot cheaper in Diamonds than it is Zen (players CAN find the rare mounts, and sell them for diamonds).\n\nTL:DR The free system in this game is ahead of the curve, because all paid for items can be purchased with the f2p system often for cheaper than the 'real money' shop. On top of that, the action orriented combat with active dodging and combos is super fun.","March 9, 2015","true","156.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Almost every negative review here on steam is spot on.   If you are playing for the first time, leveling a character 1 through 60 you will most likely love this game and I would recomend it.   It's has great combat that is responsive and fluid.  The quests are interesting and fun (for a first time play through).\n\n\nIt's a wonderful experience until you reach the end game.   This is where the fun stops.   The end game is nothing more than a grind fest where you run the same quest over and over and over and over and over and over and over(keep repeating 1000's more times) again.\n\nSome of these end game campaigns are so terrible that you can actually buy tokens in the Zen store that lets you skip them. Yes for a mire $50.00 each(yes $50.00 'each') you can skip the 'dead ring' and 'sharandar' campaigns.  Think about it, people are actually willing to pay them money 'not to play' their game.  That is just insane.  Keep in mind that it is only for one character too.   Those tokens are not an account wide option. So if you spend any money for extra character slots to try out the other classes, you're stuck with doing those grind fest campaigns unless you pay for the tokens again.  It almost seems like a cruel joke.\n\nOn top of that the refinement system is not casual player friendly.  If you are someone that only has time to play maybe 2 to 4 hours a week, there is no humanly possible way to collect enough refinement points to max level an item unless you are willing to spend money.  I would not complain about this if it was only a handful of enchantments you can place on weapons and armor.   But now you have dozens of new artifacts including artifact weapons and equipment.  All needing refinement to level up.  If you played 4 hours a day for six months straight you might be able to max level '1' of these items. yes '1' out of some 15-20 you can equip on your character at one time, which doesn't even include the ones you might keep in inventory to switch around depending on what tasks you are doing.  That is just for the refinement points and doesn't include the Reagents needed for the upgrade.   It's absolutely crazy.  There is no way a casual player is going to do this without spending houndreds of dollars to upgrade them.\n\n\nThe other thing to be aware of is rebalancing changes.  Neverwinter has been adding new classes and content that has required the game to be rebalanced with every major update.   I understand that this is needed for better game play.  However as I mentioned above items that require refinement to upgrade is a very costly whether you spend the time or the money to do it.

Anyone who has invested the time and or money to upgrade items that buff these stats might not have choosen to do so. That can be literally months of work for some people who used their time to upgrade those items or hundreds of dollars for others who paid to upgrade.\n\n\nSO if you're a new player starting out leveling a character 1 though 60 savior the moment.

Almost every negative review here on steam is spot on.   If you are playing for the first time, leveling a character 1 through 60 you will most likely love this game and I would recomend it.   It's has great combat that is responsive and fluid.  The quests are interesting and fun (for a first time play through).\n\n\nIt's a wonderful experience until you reach the end game.   This is where the fun stops.   The end game is nothing more than a grind fest where you run the same quest over and over and over and over and over and over and over(keep repeating 1000's more times) again.\n\nSome of these end game campaigns are so terrible that you can actually buy tokens in the Zen store that lets you skip them. Yes for a mire $50.00 each(yes $50.00 'each') you can skip the 'dead ring' and 'sharandar' campaigns.  Think about it, people are actually willing to pay them money 'not to play' their game.  That is just insane.  Keep in mind that it is only for one character too.   Those tokens are not an account wide option. So if you spend any money for extra character slots to try out the other classes, you're stuck with doing those grind fest campaigns unless you pay for the tokens again.  It almost seems like a cruel joke.\n\nOn top of that the refinement system is not casual player friendly.  If you are someone that only has time to play maybe 2 to 4 hours a week, there is no humanly possible way to collect enough refinement points to max level an item unless you are willing to spend money.  I would not complain about this if it was only a handful of enchantments you can place on weapons and armor.   But now you have dozens of new artifacts including artifact weapons and equipment.  All needing refinement to level up.  If you played 4 hours a day for six months straight you might be able to max level '1' of these items. yes '1' out of some 15-20 you can equip on your character at one time, which doesn't even include the ones you might keep in inventory to switch around depending on what tasks you are doing.  That is just for the refinement points and doesn't include the Reagents needed for the upgrade.   It's absolutely crazy.  There is no way a casual player is going to do this without spending houndreds of dollars to upgrade them.\n\n\nThe other thing to be aware of is rebalancing changes.  Neverwinter has been adding new classes and content that has required the game to be rebalanced with every major update.   I understand that this is needed for better game play.  However as I mentioned above items that require refinement to upgrade is a very costly whether you spend the time or the money to do it.  When they rebalance the game what you may discover is that an item you are working on may no longer be worth the effort.  For example Mod 6 is going to change how regeneration and life steal works.  Anyone who has invested the time and or money to upgrade items that buff these stats might not have choosen to do so. That can be literally months of work for some people who used their time to upgrade those items or hundreds of dollars for others who paid to upgrade.\n\n\nSO if you're a new player starting out leveling a character 1 though 60 savior the moment.  It's doesn't last for the end game.

I'll let you know what I've found in my first few weeks of playing:\n\nAlmost nothing in the game cannot be gained with enough time and effort.  There are mechanics that allow you to earn "zen" which is the in-game currency you directly get from cash infusions from your bank account.  Maximizing these mechanics will take a great deal of time in and of itself, and even once they are maximized, a player would need to manage a lot of gameplay to earn the zen needed to generate enough zen for an "epic" mount or companion.\n\nFor disclosure's sake, I will admit I have put about $60US into the game, all in one primary character who is leveled all the way to 60 and has epic equipment.  I have 3 other characters who are currently leveling up who have received absolutely no financial help from the primary character, nor have they received any form of real-world financial infusion.   And this is the important part: those characters are doing absolutely fine in the PvE world.  Is a level 20 character with no money invested going to be as powerful as a same-level character with 20 or 50 dollars in it? No.  That does not mean the zero dollar character is unable to handle the foes he/she meets in the PvE game.\n\nSome hints if you want to play on the cheap: #1 - You can start using "professions" at level 10 or 11.  Use them, in particular the "leadership" profession.  The leadership profession allows you to generate Astral Diamonds (the in-game currency which can be converted to Zen) at a fairly good rate.  All the crafting professions have (at high levels) the ability to create items which can be auctioned for significant amounts of Astral diamonds as well.  Moreover, the professions can easily be managed even when you're not playing the game through a web-browser.  Check in a few times a day, and progress your professions and the levels should build relatively quickly.\n\nHint #2: Lockboxes are for suckers.  Sure, they are one of the ways to get an epic mount/companion right now, but they cost more in Astral Diamonds than they generate on average.  Keys cost 125 or 112.5 (if you buy ten at a time) zen (1.25 or 1.13 usd) to open them, and usually only generate enough astral diamonds to buy back between 60-90% of that.\n\nHint #3: Don't sink large quantities of AD into improving enchantments.  The cost/power ratio you get decreases with each level of enchantment.\n\nHint #4: Epic mounts are not really necessary.  Nice? Sure.  Needed? Not for PvE.\n\nHint #5: Sword Coast Adventures - you can get epic companions with this online function.\n\nHint #6: The foundry- if you're creative, you can generate adventures which can earn you epic mounts/companions.\n\nAnd Hint #7: Try to get by with the best equipment you find in your adventures, and use the Auction House only when you really need something that isn't for sale for silver/gold. Every few levels, you will find equipment better than you could have possibly used before, so save the AD for upgrading your companions/mounts and to perhaps buy an epic set of equipment.\n\nFor reference: you need 1,550,000 AD to go from a common (free) companion up to an epic one through promotion, or 1,250,000 to go from uncommon (also relatively easy to get with no cash) to epic.  If you haven't been hoarding them, you will find the upgrades very expensive, and you will also discover your companions decrease in usefulness when you don't upgrade them.  Upgrading a mount is even more expensive.\n\nIf I'd known these hints, the 60usd character I have would have cost me maybe 30, and probably could have been done with a disciplined 20.","January 2, 2014","true","990.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'll give a few examples:\n\n+There are free mounts in the game which can be bought with in game gold\n-These are very plain and basic mounts\n-The best mounts in the game cost 2500 -3500 ZEN this translates to £25...... £25 !!!! for a horse skin and faster movement speed which i can buy a whole game for\n\n+You can earn astral diamonds (can be converted ZEN) 6 times a day so there is a way to earn the items\n- we'll say you might make 20000 astral diamonds in a day which i personally wasn't anywhere near doing but 1 ZEN = 380 AD so to buy that horse 3500ZEN you're going to need 1,330,000 astral diamonds which is 66 days of play. Which is stupid.....\n\n-downloadable content is ridiculously expensive considering its just items, gear and mounts.\n\n-high level items all require astral diamonds or zen\n\n-the ingame money is pretty much useless and can only buy health potions and kits\n\n-to unlock the treasure chest at the end of that dungeon you just did (not regular quests) requries you to buy a key with astral diamonds\n\n-game is too simple, you get 3 abillities, 2 passives, 2 big abillities and a class specific sort of "mode". These can eb swapped out with other skills that you unlock but heck give me some variety\n\n-game was never really that challenging, I'm sure it gets more difficult but I got to level 43 with very little difficulty\n\n+game looks alright for a mmorpg, very few look amazing\n-game is very poorly optimized, i'm running a titan x, 32GB of ram, 6 core with hyper threading and  all over clocked on a 4k screen.\nwitcher 3 which is an absolutely stunning game graphically and rubs this game in the dirt always had 40+ fps\nIn some areas this game makes me hit 20 fps which is abysmal\n\n-quests are quite repetitive\n\nI guess I'll get to some positives then now\n\n+areas and mobs are diverse\n+boss fights are pretty cool\n+good to just pass some time if you've got nothing to play\n+game has a lot to do by the looks of it and if you've got hundred of pounds to waste then heck go ahead\n+very clear dungeons and dragons elements\n+though you can't use the majority of your abillities there's quite a lot to choose from\n\nIf the developers want to improve this game make your zen exchanges rates better with real world currency\nmake the regular currency able to buy more things, literally everything should be pourchasable with coppers even if you have to balance it by making it quite a lot\nToo many sub currencies in the games e.g. seals, astral diamonds, zen, coppers......\nThings like loot shouldn't come at a cost to just open","December 28, 2015","false","63.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You can have 3 powers, 2 really strong powers that you need to charge, and 2 class features at a time in your rotation.\n\nVoice acting in the game is alright compared to most i've seen in online games, might be a big plus if you don't like reading a lot of text.\n\nQuests are meh, get sent to this area, get lots of quests from the people, kill this and that, go to that dungeon, then report back to the main city and get sent to another area.\nHowever I do enjoy the campaigns, which have greatly improved lore in my opinion. If you're a D&D fan you'll appreciate it more as you actually get some lore notes as you play.\n\nIn game store is the most expensive I've seen in a while, you'd have to spend some crazy money to buy a good mount and a companion. I will admit i spent 30 dollars so i could get some stuff. However, the game has an auction house where you can get highest tier companions AND mounts with astral diamonds, which you can get doing some daily quests and such. it might seem really expensive and time consuming, but it's not that bad. Also you can buy the zen and exchange it for diamonds, which can get you a crazy amount of diamonds so you can buy what you want from the auction house.\nI wouldn't recommend spending money in this game until you're maxed out and completed ALL campaigns. Only then should you start worrying about actually having high level enchantments and stuff. By that point you might even have to afford such things with the astral diamonds you'll probably amass. (it took me about a week after i hit lvl 60 to buy an epic set of gear)\nI see some people complaining about inventory space? Since i started playing i've never had problems with inventory management, i don't think i'll ever buy more space\nI read thru the bad reviews and they're all about the same things, how expensive things are in the game and i couldn't agree more. But honestly no one is telling you to spend money on it, you can get it all for free by simply farming. Oh you can't handle playing a game for months? why play mmos then? I been playing games like runescape since they came out, I played warframe since early betas, same with path of exile and other mmos.\n\nThis game is fine, has it's flaws but most of the bad reviews are exaggerated. I hit the level cap a while ago and thru ingame farming, i have some of the best gear and weapons, along with those oh so expensive enchantments and what not which only took me about a 2 weeks. People don't realize that all mmos take time and effort to be good at, so what if it takes a year to be amazing at this game? I play many mmos and there's nothing about this game making it pay to win to the max. Only an idiot would pay to win, as you can see how crazy expensive things are. Most people you'll see with really good gear  didn't pay to win, they simply been playing since 2013? If you're getting destroyed in pvp it doesn't mean they paid to win, they just been playing way longer than you (it takes about a week to hit lvl 60 if you play everyday.)\n\nOverall, i would say this isn't the most friendly game to new mmo players, but i say its definitely worth playing. It may be a long run, but eventually you'll be one of those guys destroying newbies in pvp. If anything, play with a friend it makes the game much better, i never get bored playing with my friends.","January 21, 2015","true","700.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
