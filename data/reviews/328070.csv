Even though it's still just exposed beam and foundation, you'd forego the central heating and plumbing of your old single bed ranch and drive out to the construction site in the middle of the night to pace around the floorplan, camp out under the stars in the frame of your new home, and dream.\n\nEven in its raw state, Reflex will give you some great experiences, like editing a map in realtime while 8 players are deathmatching on it. When Reflex and its engine are complete, they could inspire positive changes in modern shooters, and bring some innovation to broader gaming culture, from esports broadcasting to machinima, in a way that no game has since Quake.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aug-/recommended/328070/","aug-","august","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aug-/","17 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nReflex is a fast paced, close quarter shooter that drew it's inspiration from Quake itself. If you're familiar with the intense, fast pased action of Quake, Reflex is going to make you one happy gender-neutral pronoun.\n\nPlaying it is...incredible. The learning curve is higher than Mount Everest, but that's what makes it a fun game to play. In my first match I said "This is disheartening (I was 0-30), yet entertaining." Each game was a rush of skill and smarts, just like Quake, and it's a feeling you just can't grab from many other shooters.\n\nGraphics. Great. Take a look at the community page for some incredible screencaps. It's one of those games where you can really feel buttery smooth gameplay, even capped at 125FPS (you can cap to 1000FPS and infinite).\n\nReflex has no large community of it's own, unfortunately. Instead, it draws players from all versions of Quake. Some players have said Reflex improves upon Quake, with the addition of map editing (currently in testing), and the overall updated feel of the game. If you've ever played the flash game SuperHot, imagine that but at the pace and excitement of Quake.\n\nReflex has currently been in a year of development. It's creators have kept in close touch with the community, making sure to give thorough review for each patch, and it seems that they are always catered towards what the community wants to see. I see no signs of stopping, and I anticipate this incredibly fun game to continue to be so in the future.\n\nI have huge hopes for the future of this game. As this game grows in popularity (it damn well should), a bigger playerbase will form. You'll have more noobs and more pros transitioning over from Quake, as well as much more dedicated server hosting for every region. I can't wait to see more.","July 4, 2015","true","8.5"," 55 of 56 people (98%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","98","55","56","9","0"

Between Quake 1, Quake 2, and Quake 3, so many gamers got their first taste of an AFPS and loved it.  They played online, made many new friends, and even went to LAN parties because of the game (QuakeCon is still a yearly tradition for thousands of people).  Competitive players from the Quake series are amazing to watch with their high technical skill and strategic depth.  These games have been compared to high speed chess for years.  Still, the genre is practically dead compared to MOBAs, MMORPGs, and realistic FPS games like CS/BF/CoD.  Why is that?\n\nTurbopixel studios knows why, and they are on the path to reviving the AFPS genre.  As of the end of 2015 the game hasn't been advertised heavily, and that's because the genre is still very difficult to learn.  In any Arena FPS games, newcomers get stomped by the veterans and have very few easy ways to learn.  So what's going to change in Reflex?  Most importantly, proper matchmaking and a very in-depth tutorial system that actually teaches people what they need to know to play the game.  These features are set to come out in 2016, and I expect it will change the game forever.\n\nAside from welcoming a new generation of gamers to the genre, Reflex has a home-made engine that touts the best netcode in any FPS, an in-game map editor (which can be used while your friends frag each other on your map), and unmatched smoothness for input.  All of the important options that players should consider changing are available in the menus and not tucked away in obscure console commands.  Every part of the User Interface is written in LUA and can be tweaked to your heart's content.  The community has written a number of serious overhauls to the UI as well as new and unique widgets.\n\nIn one year of Early Access, the Reflex community has made over 500 new maps.  In the most recent patch, those maps can be uploaded to the Steam workshop where servers will download them on demand.  You can make your own map, toss it to the workshop, go to a server with players, vote to play your map, and get feedback immediately - how awesome is that?\n\nKeep an eye on this game.  If you want to get into an Arena FPS, there is no game with a brighter future than Reflex.","December 30, 2015","true","829.7"," 48 of 50 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","48","50","0","2"

If you didn't - you'll probably still love it. Reflex is a fast-paced shooter inspired by an era of FPS games that didn't have regenerating health, prone stance, or scopes. No loadouts either, every player can pick up the same weapons from around the maps, and they shoot exactly where you point them at, so if your shots don't connect you've no one else to blame.\n\nThe movement is simple, but complex. Relatively easy to learn, but difficult to master. No wall jumps or dodges, or other scripted increases of speed (press x to fly that way). Instead the player uses air strafing, air control and knockback from explosions to gain and conserve momentum. This allows players to get around the map at great speeds and perform various trick jumps to get from point A to point B quickly and efficiently.\n\nWhile the game feels good, the input feels responsive and the gameplay itself is solid, Reflex is still very much an early access title, and by no means near completion. At the time of writing this, you can build maps using the built in editor, host servers and play TDM/duel, and not much else. There is no matchmaking or ladders yet, there isn't even a GUI for changing your keybinds, you do that in the in-game console. All that will come though, patch by patch, as the developers work on it. The game is already fun to play, and has great potential, but it'll take some time for it to become a finished product.\n\nThat being said, even in it's current state I do recommend Reflex to anyone who likes FPS games, it's a breath of fresh air amidst all the modern military shooters.","November 6, 2014","true","49.2"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","32","35","0","0"

The entire game engine is built from scratch just for this game and as a result, it runs BUTTER SMOOTH.\n\nThe first ever EU tournament for reflex was hosted on 12/02/2015 and it proved how well the game works for competitive play, there were no real gameplay issues during the tournament and there were 5 maps in the pool (all of which are new and surprisingly really well made). Everyone had a blast and we got to witness top players such as HAL9000 and rokky wreak havoc in 1v1 matches, when you watch them play you will realise just how high the skill ceiling of the game is.\n\nThe development roadmap promises to bring an overhaul to the game's UI, full matchmaking support, training and tutorials, steam workshop integration, art integration for maps, more gametypes and more features for the already amazing map editor.\n\nI'm genuinely excited for the future of this game and I already love the game even in this early stage.

Reflex is an example of what modern games should look like. It has oldschool quake-like mechanics with some new features like new jumps and new guns. If you feel yourself as an oldschool gamer and you like something like quake, unreal tournament and all that stuff - you should definitely check Reflex out. Its sad that these games do not get so much attention as moba or some modern fps games do because oldschool games, and especially arena-fps games, require skill. If you are not skilled enough - you can go play COD or play any fps using a gamepad. You will be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off if you are not skilled or if you'll try to play this game with a gamepad.

This is Quake 2 making a comeback in a way that I never could have imagined.  I've been waiting so long for this to happen that I insta-came when opening up this store page and bought it on the spot to help keep development moving forward.  And no I didn't clean up, there was no time!\n\nYes, obviously it is alpha (aesthetics, features, optimization, and minor weapon balancing), but the base mechanics are simply flawless.  The movement, jumping, and the hit registration are on point.  You just can't ask for anything more.  I used to make jump maps (and others) back in the day (eS) and the stake, plasma, and portal jumping definitely compliment the game and open the door for a whole world full of map ideas.  And yes, all the original jumps are still there including strafe/speed, circle, rocket/grenade, and double/triple/quad/etc.\n\nThis game, if continued on the right path and so far they have absolutely nailed it, will go down as the true sequel to Quake 2 and become legendary.  Keep up the good work!\n\nUPDATE:\nI see some reviews complaining about controls, but you can bind just about any key to whatever you want via the console (~ or tilde key) with command "bind key command" without quotes or simply edit the config (game.cfg) in the steamapps game folder typically located in "Program Files/Steam".  You can also look at the whole list of commands by bringing down the console and pressing TAB twice and using pgup/pgdn to scroll.

Easy and fun to use editing tools. Tons of customization options for UI. Great movement for arena fps game(like quakeworld or cpm, but closer to cpm). Having spent nearly 500 hours on it I can say it has been overall fun experience. Hard to master(yes this is a good thing).\n\nPerformance has been mostly great, but be warned that this is still in early development and things do not always work flawlessly. You might want to lower graphical settings to as low as possible to get optimal performance. Dev team is also very small and progress on the game is slow(but they are doing great job really). Right now there are several issues with the game as I'm writing this review and to name few: Rocket knockback is ridiculous, item timers easily scriptable on the hud and are on by default, other possible hud related "cheats", all of the game resources can be edited(it is not restricted much). Visual effects that cannot be turned off which are blocking your view.\n\nCommunity is "fine" but very small. Most of the players are people who have spent 1-2 decades already playing similar games. I'm sure there is support if you just go ask around and you are willing to learn the game slowly. Find some group of people to hang around and play with. With matchmaking planned for the future, this could potentially be something awesome as long as player base grows enough.\n\nPretty much replaced cpma for me. With few issues that I can overlook for now, it is looking really solid game.","May 17, 2015","true","625.6"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

Turbo Pixel deserve a huge thumbs up afaic. This game gives me solid 100 fps and really for an pre-alpha game, the gameplay is very fun and good. Only experienced few graphical glitches but framerate never dropped in gameplay.\n\nEditor works really well and i am amazed how easily you can just jump between play and edit mode. There is literally no delay, you just switch on the fly and Boom! You are now in playmode. Editor is also easy to use if you have interest to it. It works still mostly developer console-based, so if you want a nice ui in the editor, it doesn't yet have it but it works very nicely already at this point. Multiplayer map editing also works very nicely and didn't experience any problems at all mp-related.\n\nI am pleased and can't wait to see this game in more complete state.","November 5, 2014","true","970.2"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","18","19","2","3"

Because you ask what did I do wrong and people take up an hour out of their own time to explain this to you, I only just started playing a few days ago and with prior indepth knowledge of another arena shooter(Quakelive) which quite frankly gave me a heavy advantage over other ArenaTDM players(Clan Arena) I was still useless at utilizing the CPMA jumpstyle as I wasn't used to it despite there being PQL in QL, on the very first server I joined some friendly guy offered to help me as soon as he noticed I was struggling - I was trying to strafe through a step-up jump, derp - and it went on from there. Then I started to find all sorts of new things such as maps I've played in Quake etc. Thunderstruck, Longest Yard, Campgrounds(Still waiting on hellsgate and hearth though) these are 100s of custom maps made by the community, and exactly the day after I bought the game the UI was updated which I must say fits the game quite well. Only a few hours into this update people all around the community started making scripts for huds and much more which really did help me shift into the game easier.\n\nAside from that on the technical aspect of things, the netcode is brilliant I feel none of that heavy lag-compensation I get from other games meaning I'm free to destroy the ♥♥♥♥ of any unfortunate soul with my Ion Cannon(LG gun), I'm not exactly sure about this one but the hitbox feels perfectly adjusted as with rail you have to hit exactly where the enemy is(this may be due to the netcode) making it more difficult but at the same time easier when you know where you are hitting and what you are doing so you don't have to worry about those ghost rails or through wall shots anymore on this game and you can feel proud knowing it was you who made that quadruple rail combo that rekt somebody before they even knew it was coming and not the server thinking you hit them.\n\nLet's be honest do I recommend this game? Totally, it's fun to get into and have there on your list waiting until it's completion because that is definitly going to be a big thing in terms of exposure for the game, though if you're looking for a completed game I wouldn't exactly say this is completed but you can play enough matches with good game-modes against others and even practice defrag on servers hosted by the community made by maps by the community. So yeah, go ahead and buy it, it's only 10$ you're practically getting a meet-the-community early pass and joining this sentry gun of a game(Hehe, tf2 joke) and also if you're lucky you might get a present for early access though I'm not saying what it is....\n\nTL;DR: Buy the game, or i'll jarate you.","April 9, 2015","true","40.3"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","14","14","3","0"

I wrote a pretty nasty review when initial release hit because with how unpolished it was, and after the first big wave of players receded into only a handful, I had assumed that this would simply be another case of a promising arena shooter going the way that countless other titles of the same genre have in the past decade and vanish into obscurity.\n\nWith the release of Alpha (previously in pre-alpha), I have to say my hope has been restored a bit coming from playing the first initial build and a few buggy and near unplayable builds after. The game is no longer the bare bones mess it was upon first release and can even be played with ease on my 4 year old laptop. The console only command scheme that came as a product of how early in development it was when it was first released is now gone and replaced with a pretty respectable looking menu that can customize most anything you would want to put into a custom config. It should also be said that the menu and the game itself has some nice bells and whistles as well despite being in alpha, such as being able to fully customize your hud in game via a highly customizable lua script based system, or being able to create custom maps in game as well. To add, both of these features seem to have a avid following from the small yet solid community. It should also be said that various detrimental glitches/bugs have also been squashed such as being unable to bind jump to mousewheel.\n\nAll these changes in a realitivly short people of time help make this game shine brighter with the possibility of actually making it in my opinion and apparently other's as well by what I've been seeing new players saying about the game while playing. Who knows, maybe at the rate this game is going, with it's already incredibility smooth gameplay fairly rapid growth, the possibly of shaking the throne that the rather aged, casualized, and now sloppy Quake Live might not be as impossible as it once sounded.\n\nInitial Release Review for Comparison:\nCan you say dead on arrival?\n\nJumped the gun way too quick to release on early acess with only the framework of the game.\n\nWith this kinda game you dont want to just get those few die hards on board, they'll already come. What matters and what keeps a game alive is putting in something that will keep people around and bring in new players. The framework of a arena FPS does not do this.\n\nI doubt it will have any hope of picking up steam due to bad release, and heres hoping im wrong, but with not even the weapon models done I think there is slim hope.\n\nedit/test","May 14, 2015","true","20.9"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

All of this is done on a custom engine written just for the game.\n\nThe game has amazing netcode, I have personally played quite well on some EU servers with ~110ms ping (I'm East Coast US). This is something that no other game can really claim.\n\nThe movement system is very advanced and extremely rewarding to learn and master.\n\nThe community is full of helpful people as well as players who are both highly skilled and completely new to AFPS games. Players like Kovaak, who has been playing AFPS games since QuakeWorld, are very skilled, knowledgable and always open to help new players.\n\nThere's a very active Discord server where you can find others to play with, get help with the game, see new maps and stuff people are working on, or just general chatting. It's also very easy to communicate with the developers on here as they are very active in the chat and will answer most questions. (download the app from discordapp.com and get the invite code from the forums to join)\n\nThe UI is competely scriptable in LUA, you can pretty much make it look however you want. Or you can just download HUDs and widgets that other people have made.\n\nThere are many games modes, 1v1, ffa, tdm, ctf, race, arena ffa and arena tdm.\n\nThey are all played, although I will warn that 1v1 is the most popular and main competitive game mode. Don't let this discourage you from playing other modes, though. There are always people playing other stuff, and on reflexpickup.us there are almost always people looking to play pickup games of CTF and TDM.\n\nThis is one of those games being built with the concept "easy to pick up, almost impossible to master."\n\nEven if you aren't a super-skilled FPS player, there is fun to be had in Reflex, as the developers want to make the game in a way that fixes the issues with how games like Quake were very closed to newcomers.\n\nOne of the main ways the devs seek to fix this is with things such as match-making, more stuff for new players to do, as well as tutorials and the like to help players learn. Matchmaking is coming Early 2016.\n\nAnother cool thing is that the game uses an in-game map editor. Making maps is very easy, you simply go into editor mode (default is the number 0 key) and start building. It's even possible to have other players come in and run around your map while you are editing, or even have them help you by going into editor mode themselves. This makes co-op mapping significantly easier than most other games. Because of this, there are a significant amount of community-made maps, many of which are extremely good. Like my map, VST1 aka Abaddon, which is the red map with the arch in the lava that you can see in screenshots ;). (It's a lot less red, and looks much better now)\n\nBelow is information for competitive gamers, I go into detail about how in-depth competitive play is and what to expect.\nSince 1v1 is what the majority of competitive players play, I will explain a bit about it for people new to AFPS/quake-like games.\n\n1v1 is very in-depth in this game and skill differences become very apparent. It can be very unforgiving to new players because if a new player unknowing goes up against a veteran player it can end in a pretty large score difference of something like -3 - 40 pretty easily. Although, to those that don't give up and keep playing and improving, you will find yourself getting much better and eventually you may reverse those scores. I was completely new to the AFPS scene when I first got this game and have improved drastically.\n\nAlso, because of how 1v1 is and what it does to you, when you improve at that mode and this game in general you will find yourself being significantly better in other games as well. For those of you who play CSGO, think of 1v1 as being in a clutch situation but for 10 minutes straight and with your opponent able to move extremely fast.\n\nThis will be a very basic explanation of the mechanics, and a more experienced player could probably explain this better, but this should help give new people an idea of how in-depth the mode can be, primarily at higher levels of play:\n\nThe mode works where, at the beginning of each match, both players spawn at random spots around the map with 100 health and just the Burst Gun (which is very weak) and the melee weapon. Both players must then attempt to acquire "control" of the map by getting armor and weapon pickups to increase what is referred to as their "stack." Stack is represented by the total amount of armor, health and weapons a player has. Generally, who ever has the better stack is in a better position in the match. Whoever has less pickups is generally considered the "out of control" player who must do what he can by positioning himself and using tactics/strategy to regain control of the map. The "in-control" player needs to actively maintain control of the map by both getting the pickups and fragging (killing) the out-of-control player. In order to keep collecting pickups and mainting control, the in-control player must take damage either from the other player or from themselves due to how the armor system works.\n\nWARNING: CPM comparisions below if that is your trigger.\nThe game is styled after the Challenge ProMode Arena mod for Quake 3, but adds it's own flavor and spin on many things. Below I will explain some of the mechanics of the game and how they compare to CPM. This is more for people familiar with AFPS games and their general mechanics (and even more so, Quake games).\n\nThe movement system has the QuakeWorld-style aircontrol with A/D keys combined with the Quake 3 style strafe-jumping with W-A and W-D. It also expands on the double-jump system in CPM, which allows for skill-based stairjumps/rampjumps/etc, with a triple-jump system that brings completely new jump possibilities to maps, especially for jumps to take you to higher floors.\n\nThe pickup system is very much the same as CPMA where each type of armor (Green, Yellow, and Red) offers a higher level of protection for each tier, Green being the weakest and Red the strongest. Also, armor does not tick down over time like in Quake Live, but rather uses a mechanic where you must be under a certain number of armor points to pick up the next lower level of armor (such as needing 131 or less armor to pick up a Yellow if you have Red). The main difference between CPMA pickups and Reflex pickups is that Reflex does not currently have an ammo-box system, ammo is acquired by pickup up the weapons themselves. While this may change down the line, most maps and weapons have been balanced around this.\n\nThe weapons are mostly the same as CPMA, minus the BFG. Weapon balance has been changed around, and is constantly changing based off player feedback. It is rarely the case that a weapon has ended up severely broken or overpowered, and if that happens the developers are quick to fix it. Unlike CPMA, there is a default 75ms weapon switch time, so certain weapon combos are a bit trickier, although in my opinion I would personally rather have instant-switch like CPM.\n\nGood Luck, Have Fun.","December 28, 2015","true","193.1"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

I just started getting into afps's, and I am very glad I got this game. Despite the stomping from veterans, the INCREDIBLY complicated and skill-needy movement system, and the overall high skill floor, which essentially starts on the third story, and even higher skill ceiling, which pretty much goes into space, I still enjoy playing this game. This game, in its current state, has arguably the nicest and most supportive community I have ever met. I am sure that I would have left the genre before I even got serious into it because of a hard community, had I not chosen this game over Quake. Without the community of this game, I would have uninstalled the game and wish I never wasted the money. The incredibly nice community of this game should be enough to buy reflex, in and of itself.\n\nPROS:\n-smooth game play, despite my ping of at least 50 on almost every server, I have experienced very little lag on servers with ping from 50-150.\n-GREAT modablility. There is a literal tab in the options dedicated to changing the HUD. This game BEATS TEAM FORTRESS 2 IN HOW EASY TO MOD. I download a HUD, but I am not limited to that HUD when I install. I can use parts of different huds to make a HUD that I want. Team fortress 2 makes you use one HUD package at a time, with the settings the creator made, with the layout the creator made; the creator determines your HUD in its entirety. but Reflex throws that idea out the window, you don't download a HUD, you download a package of widgets for you to put together into your own combination for the HUD YOU want.\n-INSANELY NICE COMMUNITY. I don't think I said it enough. This is arguably the best community I have ever met, and I can't get over it. So much support, so much help. INCREDIBLE.\n-AND MORE!! I just cannot say enough about this game. I can only say for now, GET IT. If you like first person shooters, and you need the fastest game you can get your hyperactive hands on, look no further than Reflex. You will not be disappointed.\n\nCONS:\n- no tutorial at this point. I have heard that it is in the works, and there are community maps designed to help, but the movement system alone NEEDS a detailed tutorial and plenty of practice time. 99% of the time you see on my account in reflex is spent on learning the movement system. I have barely done any combat because I know I will get crushed.\n-highest skill floor I have ever played. Team fortress 2 is easy to get into, all you have to do is shoot ppl of the other color, and stand on the objective. Reflex, however, requires so much more. You have to move very fast, and aim at things going just as fast, and control the pick ups as much as possible, and keep track of when each major pick up will spawn, and at the same time, your opponent(s) are doing the same, so you have to predict them because most of the guns in the game are projectile weapons. The matchmaking in the making will help quite a bit, but at this point, most everyone who plays the game are very good at it. HOWEVER, they will be willing to help you learn. Just put out a request for help, and it will get accepted.\n\nVERDICT:\nABSOLUTELY GET THIS GAME. If you like first person shooters, and are looking for a challenge, this game will not disappoint.","January 13","true","22.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

Although the game is still in Early Access, it provides a polished experience, with very rarely seen bugs and solid core gameplay.\nAs of now, it only lacks content in terms of gamemodes, ranked matchmaking, and customization other than weapon skins. If you love Quake and are a competitive player, go for it. You will expect to die a lot and play many 1v1s due to the small but undying hardcore quake veteran playerbase, but it's way worth the money!","April 12","true","194.3"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sphurley/recommended/328070/","sphurley","SPHurley","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sphurley/","137 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nReflex is arguably the best pure shooter available today, despite the current unfinished state it exists in.  It doesn't have the flash or spectacle of the more mainstream games, but it also doesn't rely on stupid gimmicks to prove it's edgy.  What it has is a graphical style all its own, the best/most intricate movement system around, weapons and format which have been around and perfected for years, and a skill-ceiling which is so high it's almost obnoxious...and I mean that in the best possible sense.\n\nTechnically, it runs very smooth, the integration of the browser with the Steam Workshop provides countless options, and the included map editor is very intuitive and simple while not hindering creativity in the least.\n\nAs far as negatives, most will be addressed in coming updates.  Most notably the introduction of bots and a tutorial to provide newer players a way to learn without getting as frustrated.  Arena shooters are hard.  In my opinion far more difficult than more popular skill shooters like Counter-Strike.  Bots and a tutorial, as well as proper matchmaking, will help ease the learning curve and allow the AFPS genre to grow.  Which brings me to the largest negative: player count.  If the before-mentioned issues are addressed, as they almost certainly will before official release, player count will be the main downside of the game.\n\nSo try Reflex, get friends into it, post videos, and help grow the base.  It can only help the game.  Give it a real try, too.  Don't go into a game expecting to do great because you think you're awesome since you have a bunch of CSGO skins.  You're going to get beat your first few games...most likely badly.  But once you actually start doing well, everything else will feel slow and dull.","April 17","true","33.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Since this revolutionary game, the newly created genre of 'FPS' went wild, spreading in completely different directions. From slow paced, puzzle, post apocalyptic games like Half-Life to action packed military and science games like Halo. Most notable, to me, was the 1996 release of Quake by, yet again, id Software.\n\nThis action packed first person shooter game revolutionized the FPS genre and the entirety of video gaming as a whole. Grown through the years all the way to the Quake 3's 2000 release of Challenge ProMode Arena, or CPMA. Which is what Reflex is based off of.\n\nI personally find the Quake gameplay slow ( and it's really a fast game! ) because of CPMA and Reflex. Utilizing movement mechanics including bunny hopping, circle jumping, rocket jumping, and a whole lot more crap that will throw you into the air and across maps. Reflex has taken all of these mechanics and made it work on an even higher scale. With the addition of the most beautiful graphics that any indie company and even some AAA companies have made, Reflex meets the needs of what anybody would want out of a game. Throw in a freaking amazing community, hundreds and soon to be thousands of maps, skins, a few updates a month that improve the game every time, and the sexiest home screen of any game ever, and your have Reflex by Turbo Pixel Studios.\n\nReflex is THE best FPS game on the market, better than this strange franchise known as Call of Duty. Or even good games like Half-Life and Team Fortress.

Its simply a upgraded version of Quake 3 CPMA, which isnt a bad thing in any way. Actually, its quite the opposite. If you love fast paced, intense arena shooters, there isnt many game currently out on the market that can compete whit Reflex. End of story.\n\nWith all of that said, Reflex is still in very early development stage. And the game lacks several key features that you expect from a modern game, like proper matchmaking. Of course, all this is gonna be implemented sooner or later. But if this bothers you, the game probably isnt for you in its current state.\n\nBut oh, The game is already so good. Everything from the skill-based movement, to the gunplay just feels great.\n\nArena fps games have been out of the spotlight for to long.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/delementary/recommended/328070/","delementary","Delementary","http://steamcommunity.com/id/delementary/","85 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nReflex is a game that will truly challenge your skill as an FPS player, and remind you why they are so much fun. It's not about your teammates, or your build, or your loadout. The fun Reflex provides is endless because it constantly pushes you to earn it.\n\n-The Experience-\nIt's not a game designed for casual shooter fans, but that certainly doesn't mean you need to have 10+ years of arena shooter experience to enjoy it. If you consider yourself skilled in any FPS - the sheer depth of this game will excite you.\n\nSimply put, Reflex is a fast paced shooter focused on controlling weapons and powerups. It has a wonderfully deep movement system that requires a ton of practice to truly understand, and provides a true sense of empowerment when used correctly. As you play the game and learn new tricks, the speed of everything slowly picks up at a very manageable pace. The reward for practice is tangible, satisfying, raw, individual skill.\n\n-The Gameplay-\nFast, moment to moment gunfights and mindgames. Reflex is primarily played in a 1v1 setting, which works great with the huge map pool available. The speed of the game ensures it's never dull, even with only one person to hunt down. The core of Reflex's gameplay revolves around using the correct weapon for the right situation, and always staying a step ahead of your opponent. There are ~8 unique weapons to master. The dynamic health/armor system with fast spawning pickups adds an element of control to the game, while always leaving open the possiblity for a comeback.\n\nReflex has some of the best network connections/ hit detection I've seen modern fps games, shy of 128 tick CS servers. This game is fully equipped for professional competition.\n\n-The Community-\nMake no mistake, Reflex is not the most popular (for now). The player pool is small, but I have never been unable to find a game when I want to play. Many of the active players are vets of Quake, which means you will get stomped at first. They're not hacking, they're just far better than you. If you are the type of player that can take a loss as a learning experience, you will thrive in Reflex and improve quickly.\n\nDespite the wide range of player skills, everyone playing Reflex has been very friendly from my experience, always willing to help out or offer encouragement. New players will definitely need it.\n\nThere are also several community tools to help foster a strong sense of community, including an in-game map editor (there are dozens of community made maps playable), and a full-featured spectator mode for making frag films or just watching and chatting while watching some buddies duke it out.\n\n-Overall-\nA deceptively complex game that's easy to learn and impossible to master. It provides the "fun factor" so many FPS games just dont have anymore. You aren't playing to fill up a xp bar or unlock a new skin, you play because it feels right. Reflex has a beautifuly simple art style, with just the right amount of color and flair to keep you hooked. The level of polish in every aspect of the game is apparent right from the start. If you appreciate the depth of competitive shooters like Counter-strike or Quake, you owe it to yourself to try Reflex.\n\n","December 26, 2015","true","236.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

But after playing almost 50 hours I think I can safely say - it does have potential. Lots of it.\n\nReflex is more or less an indirect remake of CPMA. The game has been brought up to date and upgraded to modern graphics and functionalities, bringing the classic arena FPS genre into the 21st century standards. While still in early development as of when I'm writing this review, the game looks, performs and plays absolutely great. And with more improvements, such as netcode and performance optimizations coming, I'm sure the game will be even more playable in the future.\n\nHaving played CPMA for 3 years before I won't go into detail about the gameplay itself, as I think it's sufficient enough to just say it's a very faithful to the original game and everyone that came in contact with it should feel at home. There are some differences; furthermore, more balance changes are to come, but nevertheless, nobody can deny the similarities between both titles.\n\nWhile at the moment the game is bare-bones and the community is small, Reflex is surely on a way to much bigger success and with every update, the game can only get much better. I hope nothing but the best for the devs, and await what future may bring upon this wonderful title.","January 23","true","104.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","1"

After the most recent update, I was appalled by the massive progression of the aesthetics. But what was the most amazing accomplishment they have done unlike any other early access game; Is the full solid gameplay mechanics. They're challenging, faster paced than Quake III, and are much more enjoyable than getting lacerated by bugs, glitches, overpowered weapons, (not to mention they fix and fine tune even the slightest advantages of a weapon), bad maps, and terrible netcode. This is definitely most CERTAINLY the best netcode I've ever been able to experience. Hitboxes aren't out of order either, Everything is perfected.\nThis is quite possibly the perfect DM game for anyone craving fast paced arena games! The movement is easy to pick up but insanely hard to master just like the originals. This game is trying to spark back the days of arena FPS and all it needs is a bigger community. See that's the problem we need to resolve this by adding more than just it's highly competitive stature as less players would play due to highly skilled players. What would be nice is a type of team based gamemode. Or possibly create a much larger FFA map ( You don't want to be in bdm3 with 16 people, trust me) capture the flag. Just gamemodes that require larger spaces and bigger maps for the more casual players. I love this game and I want to see it progress it's amazing!! What I really hope for though is some progression towards more casual friendly gameplay for the whole community to enjoy the game!\n\nI ensure you, this game will open a new door of gaming you've never seen before It's amazing and I totally reccomend you try it out. If you get beat up in a 1v1 don't worry about it, just play and play and before you know it you'll be picking up the ropes and enjoying it more than ever before!

Anyone into Quake series, competitive and challenging FPS shooters will definitely want to keep their eyes on this. Reflex is currently on pre-alpha preview with a handful of bugs and few obvious user friendly elements missing, but the core mechanics are there and it already feels better than most of the commercial games in today's stock. The game in alpha state is only 8 eur or 10 usd, purchase includes all future builds and releases as well. The goals and efforts the developers put into the making and planning of this makes that feel almost like stealing!\n\nYou can run around alone in a map offline and easily get caught up with the smoothness and responsive input. The rewarding feel from learning new trickjumps and mechanics can't get any better than this. When a multiplayer game is fun to play just by yourself, then something is definitely done right. Netcode is still work in progress so don't except much from online games at this point, it's playable up to 50 ping though. Also, if you've ever wanted to make maps for Quake and never quite figured out those complicated editors back in the day, this is like minecraft in comparison. If I don't see this as next highlight in esports scenes or competitive gaming in general in the couple following years then there's something horribly wrong with the society.\n\nAs a die hard Quake fan and a skeptic towards numerous of arena shooter revival attempts, this one is spot on real deal!

The game is super easy to pick up if you've played quake for a long time like I have (since 1996) and feels like Quake Live should. I can't wait for them to finish the game and for it to take over from quake live because the gameplay is much, much better!! In the mean time though, the game is in great condition and perfectly playable for people who know how to play a game like this (including custom configs etc.).\n\nHere are some things I've picked up on so far that I REALLY like:\n- The rocket launcher is finally what it should be (not the nerfed POS it is in QL, but more like it was in QW). The projectile is faster, the splash damage is better (this is the biggest thing) and the firing rate is fast.\n- The LG style weapon isn't nerfed like it is in QL\n- INSTANT weapon switches (no massive delay on rail style weapon)\n- NZ and Aussie servers!\n- Doesn't feel laggy like QL does with 40 ping!\n\n\nThings I've noticed that can be improved:\n- Trick jumps aren't working like they should off stairs\n- Player jump height doesn't seem high enough\n- Gaining momentum with alternating strafing (bunny hopping) isn't high enough\n- Would be good to have a plasma style weapon (good damage in tight spaces and plasma climbs)\n\nIt's still early days though, so who knows what's next.

It takes Quake 3 Arena and uses that as a blueprint to create a fast twitch-based shooter. Some may even accuse it of being a clone, but that's the point, and Reflex has plenty to offer on its own as well. If you've played Quake 3 or Quake Live, you'll feel right at home here.\n\nReflex takes after a Quake 3 mod called CPMA, which took the original Quake 3 and rebalanced and accelerated the gameplay. The changes aren't huge and glaring to a casual Quake 3 player, but Reflex rebalances and accelerates the gameplay experience. What results is a vary fast, satisfying shooter in either large deathmatches or serious 1v1s.\n\nIf you're looking at your options for a twitch based shooter in 2015, your options aren't great. Quake Live is old, stagnant, and has made some questionable choices recently. UT4 won't be out for some time and won't scratch that itch an old Quake vet may have for frantic action. Toxikk takes more after UT than Quake. Reflex is really the last, best hope for the Quake Arena experience.\n\nThe caveats? It's still in early access stages for sure. The weapon models aren't even done and most of the maps are flat untextured grids. The gameplay mechanics themselves are very solid, however. Additionally the playerbase is small, but it seems there's always a populated server to jump into right now, so it's not dead and should only grow in the coming months.","June 9, 2015","true","11.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You start each life with a basic gun and low health and are forced to find the weapons, ammo, armor, and health that are scattered around the map; if you want to survive. While you are frantically running for a pickup you will run into other players who are all trying to stock up on the same supplies you are. This often results in high skill confrontations that require both an acute awareness of the map and sharp twitch-shooting skills. These conflicts often snowball with several people showing up to find a drop only to be caught in a massive conflict.\n\nRead Full Review here: http://rungameexe.com/index.php/2016/03/13/reflex-game-recommendation-a-early-acsess/","March 15","true","2.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You see disclaimers plastered everywhere in the game. Many of the game's options aren't in the menu UI; you'll have to adjust these in a configuration file and in the console. The game is heavily GPU-bound and requires a beefy rig, since the game's custom engine hasn't been optimized yet. But the basics are definitely there, and the foundations are very solid. I'm an average to below-average player at best, but I'm having plenty of fun - feel free to check my YouTube videos, which are accessible in my Steam profile.\n\nAt the moment, whenever you see people discuss Reflex, you would always see people discussing its mechanical achievements and how it's a competitive game. As someone that played a ton of shooters post-Counter-Strike, I'd also like to add that the game is fun, despite how much of a newbie I am.\n\nFor those of you that either played arena shooters in their youth and feel that you no longer can keep up, or if you've never touched a proper arena shooter in your life, don't be intimidated. I know that there are plenty of professional Quake YouTube videos that seems humanly impossible. These are guys that have played them almost their whole lives for a living. In reality, it's really not that bad; if you're competent in any other shooter you play, chances are that you should be able to hold your own.\n\nIf there's one thing I realized about Reflex, it's that it doesn't matter how new I am to the game - it's a fun game where I can move very fast, nobody camps a single spot for the whole match like in other shooters, and that hitting enemies with projectile weapons feels really good. It's hectic and in your face; it didn't matter that I haven't fully mastered my movement yet, because the experience is already fun to begin with. It's something that you'll never experience with Counter-Strike, Call of Duty or Battlefield.\n\nThanks again for the game, Turbo Pixel. Even in pre-alpha, I'm enjoying the game and uploading YouTube videos of my newbie exploits. Well done!","November 8, 2014","true","16.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

While familiarity with Quake helps to get the hang of it, it seems to be much more fast paced and the current small community of veteran arena players will whoop the ♥♥♥ of mid tier players. For people who aren't interested in participating in building maps or following the development, this game doesn't offer much more compared to Quake Live right now.\n\nThe name speaks for itself; if you have polished skills and are interested in a WIP revamp of classic arena shooters, I'd recommend it. For casual players the early acces stage doesn't provide too much for the price.\n\nThere's definitely some potential here.","June 14, 2015","false","0.8"," 45 of 82 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","45","82","3","8"

So far so good.  Looking forward to CTF and better map editing controls.  It's all really basic right now the only thing missing is the ability to add custom textures which is why all maps look so generic.  I'm sure that will be added in the future along with a lot of other great features that most FPS gamers would expect.  It's super intensive on my GPU because the game is not optimized.

Honestly I HATE early access games, but this game was interesting and mostly functional at its core so I gave in.\nAlso let me get this out of the way, I have never played quake or any quake variants, but I still enjoy this game greatly.\nI should have bought the game for the level editor alone. Its incredibly fun to play with when you get use to the clunky bare bones UI. I met some guys in the game and spent the afternoon building a level with them, testing and balancing the level, and playing on the level. The actual game play is fast and solid. Its an extremely enjoyable FPS.\nThis may be early access but it is definitely promising. Buy it now and wait for the full release, or buy it now and help the game grow, but either way you should definitely buy it.\nRight now, as of pre alpha build 26 it works extremely well. I am very hopeful for the future patches that will make the game optimized, give it a better net code, and make it look prettier. It lacks basic features such as graphical options, key bindings, and volume control (although this can all be circumvented by going into the config files).

I'm not exactly an expert on Arena FPS's, the only experience i have with those is what i've played of Ratz Instagib, and this is completely different than that, it's more like Quake. Which was pretty much the intention. Anyways, the devs have clearly put a lot of work into this game, and there's a lot more they have to do, like adding a movement tutorial and matchmaking, among other things. Finding active servers is a bit of a pain, however, due to the sadly low player counts. Hopefully something can be done about this in the future, maybe some giveaways could be held, or something like that.\n\nBut for an Early Access shooter, it's quite fun. It just takes getting used to, though. So if you're into this kind of game, it's definitely worth looking at.","January 17","true","31.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The simplistic look of the very first early access builds didn't appeal to me.\nI am not a big fan of how movement-centric Quake was, and I wasn't a big fan of the fact, that Reflex also has a heavy emphasis on movement.\n\nBut I love arena shooters, so I bought it anyway. And boy, was I wrong about the reasons above!\n\nThe movement feels literally PERFECT. No joke, I have played shooters since I was a child and this game... the movement feels like an extension of my mind. The weapons feel perfect, too. I can't tell if the damage is balanced, but the feeling of shooting them, the sounds, the projectile speeds, the clean projectile visuals - it's a great sensation. The mouse input is flawlessly direct, it's a breath of fresh air compared to other shooters.\n\nThe graphics are just placeholders yet, and even if they would never change - I'd play it. Because these placeholders are absolutely clean and suitable to enjoy the game. I think I'm a little bit in love. Didn't expect that from just looking at the videos and screenshots. Buy.

Exhilerating fast-paced comabt, fantastic community, brilliant value for money, excellent optimization and performance, stop reading this review and play this game *NOW*.\n\n\n\nIn-depth review: Let me start off by saying that I do not have a great deal of experience when it comes to arena shooters. This is a review describing what it's like to play this game as someone who enjoys playing a wide variety of games.\n\nTo all those of you who, like me before I bought this game, had never played an arena shooter like this themselves, I hope that my experience will help you.\n\nLet me start off by saying this:\nThis is a *fair* and *balanced* game, where *skill* trumps anyone.\nPeople that play this game on a regular basis are likely to be a lot better than you or me.\nI got my ♥♥♥ handed to me on a silver platter when I first jumped into a game. Deservedly so.\nI sucked.\nStill do.\nBut I'm getting better.\n\nWhat you ideally get is a friend or two to play with on a regular basis. Ideally if you're on a similar skill level.\nHowever, that doesn't always happen, for one reason or the other.\nSo let me start of by reccomending you watch this video series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxP7tvMqaXzBGG8VV4LqaUddV1WrErMXS\nThe guy who made it, Kovaak, does an excellent job explaining every aspect of the game, in clearly split up segments.\nWatch his videos.\nListen to his advice.\nPractice with your friends or alone.\nFind an empty server to practice on. It's not that hard...\nRace maps are fantastic for honing your movement.\nGo onto forums.\nJoin the Discord for your region. Most of the people there will be happy to offer advice or schedule training sessions with you where they will help you practice specific skills.\n\nYou do that, you'll get better.\n\nIt's a case of repeating until you improve.\n\nThat isn't to say that you can't have fun playing this game while being a n00b.\nI did last night.\nFree for all madness, with a bunch of strangers.\nCame in last.\nDidn't care, because I got a couple of great shots in.\n\nNot to mention, the people that play this game love it with a passion.\nIf you say that you need help or ask for advice, people will love to help out.\nBecause they want to see the game grow and enable more people to play alongside them.\n\nThe weapon variety is fantastic.\nThe weapon-balance equally so.\nThere is no skill-tree or loot-unlock.\nThe movement is  varied, skill-based, and allows for absolutely breathtaking stunts.\nThe maps are fun and varied, with seamless steam workshop integration.\nThere's a real-time multiplayer level-editor, that allows you and your friends to create maps together.\nThe options menu is fantastic, with just about any option or feature you could ask for being there. The FOV slider in particular is fantastic. Default FOV is 110... I like to play around 135. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThis is easily my favorite FPS to come out in years.\n\nWhat's even better, is that the devs behind this game not only made a game that had fantastic gameplay or brilliant optimization, because that would be too easy.\nNo, the game also has absolutely fantastic netcode.\nFor those of you scratching your heads, wondering what kind of techno-babble I'm speaking, let me summarize.\nYou know that number-thing when you're playing an FPS that says "ping"?\nYou ever notice that when your ping number is super high, that everyone else seems to be jittery and glitchy, teleporting all over the place?\nGood netcode fixes that, and allows people to have a better gameplay experience.\n*SIDENOTE: for those of you who know a bit about netcode, I'll adress common concerns below.\n\nI cannot laud these developers highly enough.\nGo get this game.\n10 bucks (or your regional equivalent) is a steal for something like this.\nReflex: my new favorite FPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSIDENOTE: The game does NOT favor the party with high lag. This isn't CoD. No need to worry. Just thought I would adress this, since it's a common complaint with people that spike their ping on purpose to gain an unfair advantage.\n\nPartial Resume:\nI've played RPG's from TES to Witcher 3, from Diablo 2 to Final Fantasy, from Lost Odyssey to Chrono Trigger, from Deus Ex to the original Fallout, from Dust:AET to KOTOR, from Mass Effect to Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines.\nI've played racing games, from Burnout Paradise to Forza 2, from Grid to PGR, from Mario Kart to\nI've played fighting games, from Street Fighter 4 to Tekken 6 to the original Mortal Kombat.\nI've played sandbox games, from Minecraft to GTA IV, from Terraria to Just Cause 2, from ARK to GMod, from Star-Made to Saints Row 3/4.\nI've played stealth games, from Gunpoint to Dishonored, from MGS 2 to Thief, from Batman Arkham City to Invisible Inc.\nI've played MMO titles, such as Tera, Star Trek Online, Blade and Soul, and Aura Kingdom.\nI've played strategy games such as Starcraft or Sins of a Solar Empire, AoE 2 or Halo Wars.\nI've played action titles, such as Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, Devil May Cry 3, Darksiders or Bayonetta.\nAnd I've played many 1st/3rd person shooter titles, from TF2 to Bulletstorm, from CoD 4 to MoH: AA, from Left 4 Dead to Half Life, from Halo 2 to Murder Miners, from Gears of War to Saints Row 2.\n\nAll the games listed above have been an absolute blast (most of the time) to play.\nI feel it fair to give you a general idea as to what kinds of games I've played and had fun with so that you can take a look at the list, see if there are several titles that you enjoyed that might help convince you to see if this will be as much fun for you as it has been for me.","February 24","true","7.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The gameplay is fast paced arena style, like in the good old Quake or Unreal Tournament games. Reflex has complex movement which takes some effort to learn but is very fun once you learn the basics.\n\nA great feature of the game is being able to build or edit maps together with your friends on a server. Building maps in this game can be a great social experience and it's easy to do. Just launch a server, build a map together with some friends and then give the map a try without ever having to disconnect from your server.\n\nIf you feel like trying the game then be aware that they are serious when they say this game is in pre-alpha, crashes may happen so if you build your own maps remember to save regularly! :]","November 5, 2014","true","37.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Period. This is the game I, and probably the majority of quake 3 - specially CPMA ones - players, was waiting for. Since Q3 lost its popularity (AKA decreasing playerbase) due to its aging (though it is still awesome), no other game was able to recreate the feeling of playing it. All that fast-paced combat, intense movement skills, map controll, etc. Quake live didn't help, either. But then, suddenly, Reflex is born. God, it is like a Q3 with CPMA, better graphics, new looks and - hopefully, in the near future - more players. And it comes with innovations: included map creating tool, which can be used in multiplayer!!! I mean, c'mon, mapers will be able to build stuff with friends in real time. And more: there is the new stake weapon, which adds a huge new layer of possibilities and another skill to be mastered. Btw, you can create/join servers as you will, which is great, considering today's games tend to limit this kind of freedom. Great job, developers. And thank you for creating this piece of heavenly gamitty gaming game.

Q3 and QL always felt very smooth, fast and fun so had high hopes this would continue that tradition.\n\nThe early Alpha's were a bit sluggish but after trying the new updates (18/08/15) i was extremly impressed. The maps are well made, the graphics look polished as hell and the movement is super fast which is missed in a lot of the new FPS games coming out now days. I highly recommend you pick this up for $10 and give it a shot.

As people have said this is the next quake, and we know how far quake got. The problem is that gaming has changed a good bit since then, and now, majority of players want a good graphic, brainless shooter instead of a game which requires a decent amount of skill to play and a lot of dedication to master.\n\nI really hope that Turbo Pixel add an in-depth movement tutorial explaining exactly how most of the mechanics work so that people don't abandon the game due to the difficulty of even getting started. It is an amazing game, and it can become a really large game with countless modes thanks to all the movement mechanics.\n\n2/10, GOTY 2015\n- IGN","May 16, 2015","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I think the problem at the moment is that there is no such thing as matchmaking or such atm. You go in a 1v1 server and you get your ♥♥♥♥ pushed in for about 8mins and thats it. What i'm trying to say is that most people playing already are very good at this game since they come from quake live and such. People are gonna say 'well you need to play someone better to learn' but if you get 30-0'd every game, you don't realy learn anything. I recommend that you watch YT tutorials and play 1v1 with a friend so you can actually learn.\n\nBut all this is ofc not the game its fault, its still really early.

Here's what I think so far:\n\nSystem specs: not got the fastest system (Probook with i5 and integrated graphics)  but at medium settings have seen no problems - and some very nice pings on the easy-to-use Multiplyer (MP) screen (pings anything from 6 to 120 have been playable).  Only a few players on, at the moment, and they tend to be pretty good - like me probably from a Quake / UT background.  However, have found some friendly players who were happy to chat and not just frag the hell out of me - and if you come accross me, I'll be friendly too (when I'm not fragging you that is) - just say hi.\n\nQuake / Unreal playing: after a couple of years of TF2 (mainly sniper) I wanted something faster - somehting a lot faster, but there's nothing that fits this wish, until Reflex.  I've been back playing Quake II (via Steam purchase) for the past couple of months and then found this FPS game while looking for Quake mods (have Q2Pro & KMQuake2 installed too, along with QI quakespasam and its assocaited MP bots) but removed Berserker@Quake2 and R1Q2).  Never been involved at the start of a game (this is a beta version) so this is quite fun.  It's very much like dm/ffa/TDM etc. from QI (if anyone remembers that far back - I do - it was 1997) QII & QIII (no idea about QIV as I could not get on with it) along with Unreal Tornament 2004 & Unreal Tornament III.  Expect fast game play - stand still and die  - move, move, move - unless you're a nasty camper  :)\n\nRefelx playing: I like the ffa maps, with 1v1 quite intense - all good play and nice map set-ups.  Then the jump maps (Zo_beta and others) helping me with circle stafe jumping - I'm going to spend some time on these!  Rocket jumping around the maps works well, as does bunny hopping.  Circle stafing etc. seem a little easier to do than in QII or Q3 which is good as I'm still getting used to doing them.\n\nWhat I'd like at some point: some players to choose from (the default makes a clunking thud, rather like a metal robot) and perhaps some sort of off-line basic training map.  I'm about to set my bindings ('r' for rocket launcher etc) - not sure if I'll need to edit config. yet.  Would also be nice to remove view of the weapon held - might be able to do this, as I've not looked it up yet.  Will we get rail type CTF matches, with hook / grapple?\n\nThe (beta) game now: a recommended Early Access Game - especially for players who like fast multiplayer matches.  But remember (27th July 2015) it's still  an Early Access Game and won't be anywhere near perfect - presumably there will be patches as the game moves closer to a finished product.\n\nbean$ (hope to see you on the servers and frag yer' soon)","July 27, 2015","true","2.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

No sign in: Its ♥♥♥♥ing quake.... just play it. Unlike the (not as good) other retouch quake live, the devs really go back to the old style and feel of quake where the whole interface as well as presentation is just the gameplay and nothing more or less.\n\n2.) Feels: Although the starting sensitivity is a bit slow for begginers, the overall feel of the wepons is just ♥♥♥♥ing godlike. I absolutly adore the *ding* of getting a kill which reminds me of a oven ding when somthing is done cooking. Please never replace that sound, its very funny as well as rewarding, not to mention killing someone with a rocket launcher and hearing it is just great.\n\n3.)Maps: I haven't even played all of them but from the ones I have I can say that they are just great. It's not just the look of the maps, its the fact that they go hand in hand with the hud. It's not like quake live where you have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ looking wepons and some great looking maps, they just don't fit and are some times hard to look at in my opinion. Yet regardless the maps fit the hud in this game so well it just wants to make me play it for hours on end; and the gameplay just complements that.\n\nOverall I'd give this game a solid 10/10, I can finally play a quake reboot that is just beautiful and fun all around.

Even if it's very influenced by Quake (I was more a UT guy) It looks good visually however it hasn't got all the weapon skins and there is only one map (It's a good map however) and there's no options (It's all done through CFG's) but it is very early in development, plus in the UK it's less than £10, so if you liked the trailer. It'd go for it. If you like arena shooters you're bound to like this one, however could I recommend it now? If you want to support an active game and a very active development team, go for it. If you don't want to do that because it's too early in development, it's all good.\n\n\n*Edited for correction* You can download more maps on the offical forums and you can play other users maps without them providing there is a server up.\n\n\nBut myself?

This game Reflex has some pretty advanced movements. Some I could catch onto quickly and other's I could not. I did only put an hour into the game but considering it was donated (gifted) to me I could say I enjoyed it.\n\nThings I like/dislike about the game.\nWill be updated\n\nLike:\nFast action, quick respawns in some gamemodes and easy to play with your friends for a couple of hours if not 1 at the minimum\n\nThe game has really nice graphics surprisingly and my computer could run it easily at max with 100-200 FPS\n\nThe game has a large viarity of weapons and does not always limit it to 1 different weapon in every gamemode.\n\nThe health and armor system is well done\n\nand that about covers that for now.\n\nDislikes\n\nThe community player base. The majority of the players that I played with came from Quake and had plenty more experience then what I had. + They talked trash all the time when they killed me.\n\nThe damage models. There's a lot of adjustments needed in the weapons. The only weapons I don't think that need adjustments are the radiation cannon (Whatever it's called) and the Rocket launcher.\n\nPlayer base. As much as I thought the game was going to be big. I could only find a few servers with players on them, throughout the entire day unfortunately. Otherwise I would of been able to rack up a few more hours player with real people. Instead of training on a map I struggle to surpass.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes, but only because I thought it was half decent.\n\nIf you would like more reviews on other games. Just simply follow my steam and comment on what games you thinking I should do a review on. I have very few on this account. But plenty on other's.

It's quick, It's dynamic and it requires skill. It's the q3 cpm expiriance all over again. Graphics are minimalistic but hey they are nice as hell (and you know that you would simplify it anyway as you did in q3!). Configuration - console. Key binding - console. Maps - taken from q3, weapons are "the best of" q series.\n\nOk, so Yeah I'm q3 fan and I've waited for such game for a long time. So if you are - you should get it.\n\nThere is problem, there is not much of us... so the servers are quite empty :( But this should encarage you to buy and try out! so We can make this game live and copetitive.","November 19, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you're looking for something that has most of the features implemented you'll be disappointed. If you aren't comfortable configuring your settings in a text file, you might want to hold off for awhile. Just a word of warning. The gameplay is extremely tight and the engine is good. If you're a fan of arena shooters you'll probably enjoy the gameplay. But, the game is extremely bare bones.","November 5, 2014","true","119.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is no proper netcode (it's still somewhat playable), all weaponmodels are placeholders, the map-editor is extremely basic and still very buggy at times (especially on QWERTZ-keyboards), most things have to be done through the console, etc.\n\nThat said, I have had a great time mapping with friends (90% of my playtime was spent mapping thus far, and I have never mapped before in my life), playing the terrible maps we made, and getting to know new players through trying out their maps.\n\nIf you want something to just play around with while you wait for the full game, this is pretty fun, and if the promises match up to what's there already, "dis gon' b gud".","November 14, 2014","true","54.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In terms of the gameplay it feels like a mishmash of arena shooters from the late 90's and early 2000's, this genre of first person shooters was considered to be dead for a long time accept for the occasional nostalgia trip a indie dev would throw togethor because of their love for the genre.\n\nIn terms of gameplay this game feels incredibly smooth, running and jumping all over the map feels great. The combat is also amazing, with 8 weapons you can find in the different modes, every weapon feels very powerful, with very meaty sound effects and on screen explosions stealing the show here over everything else as it should. each wepon feels varied and signifigantly different from one another, obviously drawing inspiration from quake one with its weapon roster.\n\nIn terms of graphics this game looks absolutely gorgous even with its lack of very detailed textures. The game looks very surreal and clean with its bright colors and simple looking models and environments.\n\nI only have one major problems with this game and that is that it uses micro transactions, granted they are only cosmetic and do not effect the gameplay, but still we pc gamers wanna buy the game and have the complete product not be teased with cooler melee weapons when we try to change our melee weapon (your not teased with microtransactions at all unless you try to change your melee weapon as far as I know), if microtransactions have to be in the game though, at least the developers made a wise decision and made them purely cosmetic.\n\n\nOverall this game is great fun and you will definelty feel right at home if you sunk a lot of man hours into quake and unreal tournament back in the day.\n\n\n10/10 Buy this game not its microtransactions.","December 27, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dhaK/recommended/328070/","dhaK","dhaK (C)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dhaK/","58 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTLDR - Want to improve your aim on any game? Buy this game, google kovaaak mouse acceleration, tweak the in-game settings, experience what aiming really feels like, thank me later.\n\nPromised myself to never buy an early access game because after the first impression if the game still needs a lot of work I immediately unninstall it and never play it again. I coudln't resist after a few good reviews from people I trusted. The result? One of the best first 5 hours of gaming I've had in my life. This game is absolutely amazing. Not only did I enjoy every minute I played, I was taught a very very very important lesson as a gamer:\n\nMouse Acceleration done right is the single best thing you can do to improve your aim. You see I've always been a hardcore cstrike player. In that field, acceleration is regarded as bad, evil, only noobs use it. However, professional Quake Live players have known the truth for decades. In my case, after more than 15 years I've finally learn my lesson from a $5 dollar game. Not every mouse acceleration is created equal. Understand that the acceleration everyone is familiar with, the one you can activate in Windows or in all logitech/razer/microsoft mouse drivers is bad because you can't tweak it or adjust it to your needs. For example, for counter-strike most players use a medium to low sensitivity, that way they sacrifice long range aim to improve the critical skill of turning around and improving their overall movement ability. Despite, this is far from ideal - some players use a lower sensitivity because they feel aiming is more important, some use a slightly higher sensitivity because they think movement is more important. Either way, they are giving up a part of their game. I was one of the players who gave up long range aim for increased mobility. There was no reason to do that, or better put, there is no reason to do it today. Reflex fans have created a windows tool (google povohats and/or KovaaaK) to apply the right way of acceleration to any game. Do not take it from me, buy Reflex and go to the mouse settings option menu. There, check the box named advanced settings, to enable the ability to further customize your acceleration. I guaranteed you have never seen such a great level of control on mouse sensitivity/acceleration in your life.\n\nThe idea behind good mouse accel is to narrow the range of acceleration by setting up a CAP (a maximum sensisitivity that can be achieved by the acceleration) and a minimum. That way your fast mouse swipes will be limited to the sensitivity you are comfortable turning with, and the minimum will be limited by the lowest sensitivity you believe is best to aim at long distances.\n\nAIM. Like you have never experienced before. Feel an aiming so accurate, smooth, and comfortable it makes gaming ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic.\n\nBest $5 dollars I've ever spent in my life.","December 24, 2015","true","38.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It definitely shows lots of promise and it was because of this that I had pledged more money in the crowdfunding effort (prior to the cancellation of the kickstarter) than I paid for the four copies I just recently purchased on steam to support them. I guess the best I can do now is write a hefty recommendation and hope that word can be spread better than it was when their crowdfunding was still active. Here's to Turbo Pixel Studios hopefully managing to raise enough money to complete the game of their (and our) dreams!\n\nThe game's development builds were initially to be split up into three parts, the prototype, available December 2014; the Alpha and then the Beta, prior to product release. As the game is now available prior to the original prototype date, I feel it is unfair to judge the game based on what is included so far. I will say that the game IS playable, though has a very barebones feel: it has a minimal menu, no graphics options and of course, next to no textures. The mechanics are there, but the game is not.\n\nNB (note well):\nIf you are looking at purchasing this game in its current state (as of writing, November 2014), you will be doing so solely to support the developer in their time of need. Do not expect much of a game right now. You have been warned.\n\nOh yes, there will be gibs..I will definitely be putting some time into this game as development progresses and write a thorough review and summary for those who have not heard of it. Stay tuned!\n\nSummaryA fast-paced, reaction based shooter not dissimilar from cult classics such as Quake, Unreal Tournament and similar twitch/deathmatch games.\n\nThe Game:\nIn the default game type, deathmatch, players spawn at a randomly chosen, pre-designated spawn point upon joining the game and again every time they die. The game works on a pickup-based system, where health, armour, weapons and other power-ups spawn at their own individual places around the map, and need to be walked into to be picked up by the player. As this is a high-action game mode, players are almost always dropped very near to hostiles and must either choose to fight with what they have at their disposal or dodge and weave their way to a more powerful weapon or pickup. And, as you improve, you'll likely have to manage both, at the same time.\n\nReflex brings back skill-based movement, where simply holding W is a thing of the past [or future?].\n\nEarly AccessThe final game will include several game modes, almost a dozen weapons, and at least a handful of maps, which will definitely grow over time, as a map editor is included and community maps are sure to follow. There will be tutorial maps introduced prior to release to help you hone your skills out of combat, so you can improve your frags in combat.\n\nAlpha\nThe game now has 'Race' mode with several community-made maps already. Race is essentially the popular bunnyhop mod from the Counter-Strike series. Those skilled in the game's movement will love breaking records in these start-to-finish time trials.\n\nGraphics are shaping up and the game feels amazing. Netcode feels glorious, possibly the best in-class.\n\n[in progress]\n\nBeta\nTBA\n\nNotes:As this is the first time I'm going to attempt a properly on-going recommendation (let alone, being the featured one on my profile), I feel I must point out that any part of it may change or disappear completely. Comments may not refer to content that even exists by the time I'm done.

But I feel it's TOO early somewhat, I think more options in the options menu need to be established at the least. I know there are console commands, but for many others they may not know and the game should be helping newer players. The game also requires a lot to run it well, which I feel is somewhat bad for this game, it's possible that the game has already expected a somewhat low amount of players, at the start or throughout it's life, but it might be even lower if it's hard to run(thanks to a certain few commands it got a bit better but still lags somewhat depending on specs). The game needs to focus on more options/customization a bit and finding a way to lowering the requirements to play this game which should definitely make the game a better experience. At this point, you're somewhat still better off playing CPMA or Quake Live(although others say Reflex is better than QL at this point), both CPMA and Quake Live have good customization and can run pretty easy, but of course they are full games that shouldn't excuse Reflex from striving for the same goal. Reflex has a lot of potential no doubt, and I definitely hope it gets better, it's definitely played differently from Quake which makes it a bit more unique and if the devs can put in the right things, it'll be an amazing game for the Arena FPS genre. Get this game if you have great specs and love arena shooters/Quake!","February 4, 2015","true","4.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","60","3","5","6","0"

Initially I recommended it, and I do love Reflex, however I just love it because it is a Challenge ProMode Arena clone (with less features). The only thing setting it apart at the moment is the map editor which can be edited realtime online with testers, which I don't have a lot of mapping experience with any other editor yet so cannot really say that is completely new. So while fun, I cannot recommend it. If you are on the edge of buying this, don't.

YET.\n\nI know all about the console commands but the game is just not USER FRIENDLY\n\nI love the dynamic and the color. I even like the guns and avatar. All that I feel is that it can make it a heck of a lot easier for the player to JUMP IN and enjoy the game for what it is: a visually capturing and challenging game.\n\nI play a lot of games. Believe me, I know all about the console comands. But i don't a gamer should have to spend more than 30 seconds to set up his game before he can enjoy it.\n\nHere is what i want:\n\nWeapon cycling: It should already be bound to the mouse wheel or to 'E' or something like that\nMouse speed/sensitivity: I'm not asking for much. Maybe just bump it up to 25 instead of twenty.\nA quick tutorial or at least a instruction screen so new players that haven't played twitch shooters like we have.\n\nI want these because it makes it easy for the player to just jump in and enjoy. I remember playing the first quake on my old rig. It was nice. I just think that this game has the ability to have these options immediately available as menu item.\n\nI'm going to recommend it because I like it. But i certainly don't think it is ready yet\n\nNow every stop losing your minds and just play the game if you like it.

It's current Early Access state is basically giving you a base game with freedom to do what you please with it and a fully functional and phenomenal map editor. Playerbase is probably and hopefully only going to go up, and there are already servers out there. Hitboxes and netcode have been updated and are fantastic and the game already runs great on decent PCs. The game is in Early Access but the dev team has a dedicated art assets team to see where they want to go with the game's artstyle and already has one completely textured map and detailed weapon models. The map editor is now entirely based in lua and allows for super customizable map creation with a friendly ui; and everything only goes up from here.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raidakk/recommended/328070/","raidakk","Raidakk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raidakk/","63 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA game that fails to fulfil its purpose\nMost people like this game, because it plays like a CPMA clone. That's about it. I also enjoyed playing Reflex. TDM, CA, Rocket Arena and CTF were the main game types I played, and it was really fun.  The game-play is pretty much spot on, kudos to the programmer. However, I bought this game hoping that it's going to be a HD version of Quake. Originally the store page had this art concept that persuaded me into buying Reflex:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=678330771\n\nWell... They ended up taking it down and making a cartoonish theme for the game, that honestly doesn't look any better than Quake Live. I believe that this is false advertising. I know that this is early access and games can change, but this is too much of a change, this is not what I paid my money for. What is the difference between Reflex and QL now?\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=656238750 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=639781763\n\nAnd apparently they had to change it because of the budget. The team consists of 3 people, and I think it's weird how uneven their input towards the game is. The game in terms of game-play is pretty much done, kudos to the programmer again. However the artist wasn't really making any progress until late 2015 or early 2016, and he isn't delivering the promised content. Is making art assets harder than programming? Their game designer is a mystery, I have no clue what he is doing there. The game is pretty much a CPMA clone, so what is he designing exactly? Also after having a really nice conversation with the designer, I got this feeling that he is full of sh♥t. They sold over 30,000 copies of the game plus all this DLC, and still say how they have no budget, because apparently they run $50 servers for version control and bug logs. Can't they just use their own PC as a server? Why did they waste time and money on making a Reflex engine? It's all right, but it isn't necessarily better than Unreal. Why did the artist waste time on making sci-fi art, then teslapunk art, and finally cartoonish art? He is an experienced artist, didn't he know that he wouldn't be able to pull of this UT3 look by himself? Why do they release holiday art assets, instead of working on something useful? If they are working on the game full time, why is it taking so long? If they are only working part time, why don't they use this money to hire another artist? This all sounds really dodgy, almost like they are trying to make an illusion like they are doing something productive.\n\nThe community is overall pretty nice, someone actually took their time to teach me the basics of movement. However the amount of fanboyism is also insane, I bet this review is going to be rated as unhelpful. Also most people play 1v1 and I hate it.\n\nDLC is also something that I do not welcome. The page says "There will be no additional costs when the game is final and no maps or modes will ever be locked behind a pay wall." This is very misleading, because no additional costs doesn't mean just maps and modes.\n\nIf they bring back the textures, I will change this review to positive straight away. In the mean time it will remain negative, because I don't think that Reflex does anything better than other arena shooters on the market. The whole purpose of making a new game is to make something that is superior than the old games in every single way.","May 4","false","52.8"," 8 of 25 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","8","25","0","3"

I will say yes and no.\nFirst the good part. It is a challenging game that will push the players. Good competitive FPS players will have a blast with it.\n\nSo the bad….\nThe question is what is the intent with the game?\nTo get as many players as possible to play, and maybe earn some cash on the game? Or is it just a game with “proof of concept” and they try out new way to play?\n\nThis game is not like any other competitive game that is out there. Any game that is out there can be easily played. This game can not. The movement is a core part of the game, where  maps take advantage of the movement system. If you can’t do this advanced movement, you can’t get around wry well.\nThis game hates new players. The way you have to move is beyond hard. You may even call it “extremesports” in movement.\nThink that you are out driving, the way you drive is that each wheal has its own engine, steering and braking. Left wheel is connected to a left joy-stick. Right wheel is connected to a right joy-stick. Left and right rear wheel is connected to a left and right pedal that also turns.\nNow you use both your arms and feet to steer and control each individual wheel, and you are out driving on winter road. It works at low speed but try some harder driving and you are ♥♥♥♥ed up.\nThat is what this game is.\n\nThe concept is cool, and the challenge is a breath of fresh air, but there is problems.\nOnly a few select players will “master” the movement of the game, that is how hard it is. This players will wrack havoc among everyone. They will be pure monsters vs normal players.\nNew players will meet a rockwall and bounce back. I will think that most players will turn around and find another game that does not have this steep learning curve.\nThere is a TON of games out there that can be used as an example that too steep learning curve is not good for the game.\n\nThen you have the map itself. With this advanced movement system, maps will be made where you will have to use these advanced movements. “Monsters” will be able to take full advantage of the map, get to armor and weapons that will be “hard to get to” unless you can move around properly. New players will not be able to do this.\n\nHow many hours do you think players should play just to get the feel of the general movement? 40 hours? 60 hours?\n\nI fear that this game will collide as fast as it is out, and new players will refund the price.\n\nWith the immense learning curve (with movement that many players will not even be able to do), players like monsters that will chew them up and spit them out, and maps that is favorable to the skilled players and not normal players, this game will end up with a small playerbase just like all other high-skilled games.\n\nIn the end the advanced movement is taking so much away from the shooting part of the game. It does not matter if you can shoot if you can’t get to where you need to be.\n\nThis game is not for the crowd, it is for the select few who can master the movement.\n","January 14","false","3.1"," 7 of 24 people (29%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","29","7","24","2","5"

It was fast, had good balanced weapon damage and it had real potential I would have gladly given it a 9/10. Now after a few updates that destroyed the game I can't recommend it anymore. It's slower than at the beginning, the characters are to big and easy to aim at, the weapon switch delay was increased, they destoyed the balancing of the damage, the gravity makes it realy easy to aim at someone whos in the air and the servers are full of hackers. Even Quake Live is now better than this game throught the help of the workshop support.  This game is now oriented at casual gamers and not aimed at those who loved fast pased fps from older days.\nI searched for games that were as challanging as Quake III CPM or Ureal Tournament 2004 was and this was realy good. I played it for hours with friends but now we don't even have it instaled anymore.\n\ntl:dr\nI dont recommend it to those who search for a game like quake 3 cpm.

I find Art-style in games very important. The rocket launcher (wich is the only 'actual' designed weapon in the game) look and feel amazing, I couldn't imagine a game that had that kind of art-style and feel, but no. They stated in the forums that they are going to re-make the art-style into a blocky and more cartoony style, wich i dislike very much. I think Realistic/rusty theme fits much better. I like the explosions, though.  But now, Let's get out of art and in to gameplay.\n\nEDIT: not to mention that most people who play this game at all is pro veteran quake players who kill any newbie they can find, so prepare to suck really hard at this game.\n\nThe game play is fast and smooth, it feels good to rocket-jump and frag people. But i hate one thing; You start out with ALL the weapons in the game each match. (some guys stated to me that this was just a gamemode, too bad all the active servers only has this gamemode) I find that very dissapointing since i enjoyed running around and searching for different kind of weapons on the arena in games like 'Quake' and similiar.\n\n5/10\nIt's fun to play the first couple of minutes until you get bored of the bland art-style and the lack of content. (did i forgot to mention that?)\nMy tip is to wait and see where the game comes until you buy it. Or download that free quake game on steam instead.

Spent over an hour trying to get this game to run, would constantly crash, and black out my display when run in fullscreen. Windowed mode would only work in smaller resolutions than native, major screen tearing at 1080p in windowed mode. Fullscreen just crashed the game or blacked out my display forcing me to restart. Task manager/alt tabbing did nothing. Half the guns don't have skins yet. I realize this is early access but this is like the earliest access you could imagine. It's just not a playable game at this point. Reflex shows promise if they continue to develop and hopefully once it gets to a beta stage it will be worth purchasing. I wouldn't pay for early access for this game currently.\n\nAside from not being able to actually run it most of the time, the 10 minutes I did manage to play were awesome. CPMA clone with a graphics update, remade maps, CPMA movement, fast, fun, and extremely customizable. Tons of in game HUD options, keymapping, color models, graphics options.

That ultimately means the majority of people in the world can't play this game full screen, neither can I, and if it doesn't support that one then I'm sure there's many others unsupported. Great.\n\nThat alone goes to show the painfully slow development of this game (3 years and the very basics aren't covered like supporting fullscreen), and that your money would be better spent in already finished games.\n\nThe other thing that was discouraging for me to give it a second try was looking at the Steamcharts data.

It's biggest problem is it's performace. It is practically impossible to get 1080p 60fps. My friends and I all have to run it at a significantly lower resolution (generally around 720p) just to get 45fps.  Note that we all have fairly decent PCs. As for the actual game, it's amazing. The gunplay and speed of the game is exactly how a twitch shooter should feel and the level editor is probably the best built-in editor I have ever seen in a game. If not for the optimization problems, I could see myself sinking dozens, if not hundreds of hours into it.\n\nTLDR: I would hold off purchasing this until either the devs optimize it more or if you have a super powerfull PC.","November 8, 2014","false","0.2"," 5 of 36 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","5","36","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/milkflow/recommended/328070/","milkflow","milkflow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/milkflow/","174 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhile still being an early access -title, Reflex already manages to deliver an extremely solid experience that underlines how seriously the developers take their game. Features that are not polished are left off until they are up to the level of quality that the game stands for. This ensures that while there is less content available for now, the available content is rock-solid. With only two available game types, Duel and Free for all, the game in its current state caters best to the lovers of old school games who find excitement in the simplicity and in competition against other players.\n\nWhile the game and the developeres continously underline that the audiovisual content of the game is 99% placeholder material, the game already looks great, and especially the the lighting and particle effects look beautiful. To put this into perspective, the game currently comes with only one high quality weapon model with the rest of the weapons being displayed as differently colored versions of the same basic model. From the point of gameplay, however, this is not a hindrance of any kind, as the distinction between colours is clear enough after a few minutes with the game.\n\nA minor gripe comes from the demanding specs of the game at the time of writing, but a fairly recent PC seems to handle the game without any issues, and the performance of the game is going to be enhanced as the game matures.\n\nReflex brings an interesting concept to the table with in-game level editing. While it still lacks a lot of the required UI elements to actually make it accessible to players old and new, the idea of allowing anyone to create and edit maps within the comfort of the game itself is very promising. This feature will definitely lower the gap to picking up mapmaking, as no further software or technical knowhow is required.\n\nIn short, Reflex is a really promising game that will without a doubt entice those who loved their time playing the likes of Quake and the likes that game after it.","November 16, 2014","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Movement is very fluid and, although very similar to that of Quake's, still feels unique. Very solid and responsive gunplay. Everything looks really promising so far. I could definitely see Reflex taking Quake's throne in the near future.\n\nHowever, some things to be aware of before buying in early access:\n- few players; can be difficult to get a full game going\n- very minimal menu interface (most tweaking is done through console commands)\n\nRegardless, I'd still recommend picking this up.

The 1v1 mode is really prevelant and disheartening to play, but the team modes are better if you can find one.","April 8","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is nobody playing online except private/passworded 1v1 servers. I tried joining a non-passworded 1v1 server, after waiting 10 minutes in the queue, they wouldn't let me play. This game will never be popular.\n\nEven if Doom 4 is casual console-tier crap, I'd rather play that instead of a game that makes it  almost impossible to play at all.","November 27, 2015","false","52.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
