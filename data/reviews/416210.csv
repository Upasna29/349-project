It kind of plays like a puzzle game mixed with a city building game. While some players will love being able to build their own vertical city, I was actually more interested in the puzzle element in the game.\n\nThe main mechanic in the game is to create a self sufficient city. Every block you place in your city has some inputs and outputs. You need to have enough resources to fulfill all of your blocks inputs or some of your blocks will start to decay/break down. The key is to build blocks of different types where the outputs from one block become the inputs of other blocks. In the easier challenges this is pretty simple but in the harder challenges this can be somewhat difficult since things can go wrong quickly. I was surprised that this balancing act was more fun than I was expecting.\n\nFor an Early Access game I have to say that Block'hood is quite polished. The game is fully playable unlike a lot of early access games that only have a couple features that work when the game first enters Early Access. The developers are planning on adding quite a bit to the game as well. The only issues I have right now is that I wish there were more challenges and sometimes it is hard to place a block in the desired location without having to rotate the camera.\n\nIf the premise behind Block'hood interests you I think you should enjoy the game. People who like creating their own cities could already get a bunch of time out of the game and players that are more interested in the puzzle aspects of the game can still have fun with the game.\n\nNote: I received a review copy from the developer but received no other compensation.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","March 10","true","3.4"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","36","40","0","0"

It's all about balance and planning - just like any effective community planning.\n\nOverview:\nUnlike many strategy games of this genre (e.g. Sim City) where money is a primary focus, in Block'hood the "money" is a variety of materials: water, electricity, fresh air, labor, consumer, fish, organic waste, inorganic waste, sickness, etc. (there is a huge list of these materials - including money itself).  Every building you create has an inflow requirement (e.g. a small apartment needs water, electricity, and fresh air) and an outflow (it produces organic waste, grey water, labor, and consumers).  Each building has a unique list like this.  As you develop your neighborhood you find yourself juggling these resources to various objectives.  If you don't meet your building's needs with the correct balance of material flows, your building will deteriorate and require replacing.\n\nThe game has a Sandbox mode wherein you can attempt to create a neighborhood of whatever size you desire (be careful as the more you add the more you must juggle).  Or you can play in the challenge mode where you must meet certain game objectives (e.g. collect 500 beer without accumulating more than 100 wheat).\n\nThe Good:\nAs I said before, it's a clever game.  If you enjoy puzzle and Sim games you'll probably like this one.  If you're interested in learning more about sustainability this is also a neat way to learn more.  I have had a lot of fun with both the challenge and the sandbox mode.  I have not experienced any technical problems with the game so far.\n\n\nThe Bad:\nIt's still Early Access and therefore the challenges are a little limited.  The ones available are almost more like an extended tutorial.  I'd like to see these expanded in the near future (I'm sure that's on the way).\n\nSometimes the game is a little slow. I would like the option to accelerate the game clock (like many strategy games have).  I understand not having a pause option, as it's part of the material flow strategy but once a neighborhood is setup I'd like to be able to let it run at 10x speed to meet an objective.\n\nConclusion:\nA fun title absolutely worth $10 if you are interested in the Sim/Strategy/Puzzle genre.","May 2","true","15.0"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","26","27","0","0"

It was tricky to get a grasp on the mechanical systems even with the tutorial but once I had an understanding I liked it a lot. It's about as difficult and deep as you allow it to be, and allows a lot of very interesting aspects of freedom and flexiblity in numerous regards that I've not seen in other games.\n\nIt's hard to really define what it is.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/azure_knight/recommended/416210/","azure_knight","Onyx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/azure_knight/","91 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGripes:\nI. The UI neglects in helping you figure out what is causing decay. "Decay" is an ambient destruction of usable blocks into unusable blocks that you must replace (as far as I've deduced). Optionally, you can play with decay off, which presents a much nicer free building experience, but when playing with it off from the start (as the default settings are configured), you have to build fast otherwise the decay sets in, which is the opposite effect that you would want when taking time to beautifully place down all your buildings.\n\nII. Building large projects is clunky, I was filling in an ocean and beach in a max size map which took some 5 minutes, why is there no fill tool or mass placement option? Holding your build button down for every tile when you're placing almost 100 of them or more is just a waste.\n\nIII. Resources barely do anything; the only thing that matters is making sure everything is green in the production screen. The game gives you arbitrary goals to work forwards to, but the only real goal I've been able to come up with is build something without decay turned on then figure out what you need to make all the numbers green and build around that.\n\nIV. Deliberate lies. In some of the levels you're allowed to build tiles which you cannot support in that level. In the second challenge mode for example (or around the early ones, can't recall precisely which), you have the option of building a cafe, which consumes bread. What produces bread? The UI isn't going to help you (why no option to search for "produces x resource" or "takes in x and produces y"?) so once you finish scrolling through all the build options you come to the realization that you have literally nothing to produce bread. What actually produces bread is a bakery but you won't learn that until you have access to it.\n\nV. Moving the view port is annoying, up and down but not left and right? I'm an avid city sim player and I'm willing to learn a few shortcut keys to move the screen and rotate, just copy an existing scheme like the Sims.\n\nVI. Once my GUI disappeared and there was no option to restore it. I tried pressing all the F keys and most keyboard keys but I had to destroy what I was working on.\n\nVII. There's icons on the inspect mode such as a cog wheel that the game neglects to tell you what they're used for.\n\nVIII. So many tiles with no clear indication of how they interact visually upon first inspection. OK, so from doing the tutorial you will have an idea of what feeds into what, but the game isn't going to bother telling you this or help you out. Are you missing a resource you need? What needs it? Where can I get it? All questions you will be asking and not getting answers to until you spend about half an hour watching chains of buildings decay and you replace them over and over until you finally figure out how many X you need to support 1 Y building.\n\nIX. I had nearly 900 greywater from apartments in the third challenge level that had no relevancy, despite tooltips claiming that it would have implications. What crazy amount can my simulation tolerate before something bad happens? Can't I at least get a warning? In said level I didn't even have access to buildings to process the greywater (Which is like waste water produced from certain buildings notably apartments).\n\nA short description of what the rest of the game entails:\nKeep the numbers green and produce enough to stop decay while processing away waste. You can build some advanced buildings that require a more complex support system but you don't really have to. Once you get the numbers green in challenge modes you can just go watch Youtube or something while you wait as there is no speed up simulation button. There's also buildings which synergize together and others which have anti synergy, but again this barely matters.\n\nAll in all I'm bored after my time spent playing, there's also some inhabitants that you can work towards unlocking and watch meander around your simulation, but they don't have any specific differences or benefits that I've noticed.","May 6","false","1.7"," 43 of 64 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","43","64","3","5"

Though you discard all structural design and regulations (for the most part), this is definitely for anyone into design and planning. I can see this as a tool in classrooms and studios as the push for sustainability and self-sustainable cities are gaining momentum.\n\nI definitely recommend this game. It is like a cross of SimCity and Legos: your design choice has impact as you maintain your city but you have freedom to design what you will to your liking in a very cute modular form. It is very addicting; I would take on a several challenges and next thing I knew it, three hours passed (and my landscape homework remains undone).\n\nFew things I would recommend adding (if possible) is panning around so I don't have to fight the camera when I want to view a specific area of the world and allowing players to access their save files from the main menu. I had to load up a challenge or the sandbox mode just so I can get the option to load a save. There may have been a recent fix addressing these issues so ignore this portion if it has been added. ^^;\n\nOverall, it's very fun. The challenges will really make you think (and rage but that's just me) but you can always relax in the sandbox mode by creating your own cityscape.\n\nSo go and put a huge row of windmills or a huge stash of bee farms in front of your apartment complex! I'm sure they will be fine since they're getting both electricity and fresh vegetables!","March 13","true","16.6"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

Let me count the ways...\n\nTHINGS I (ESPECIALLY) LOVED\nThe art style reminds me of a modern Monument Valley- not quite as breathtaking (currently), but I'm praying the devs will push the game to that level of beauty, with their own flair of course.\nThe background, lighting and sound effects slowly change in tandem, giving soft and atmospheric impressions of sunsets, foggy nights, grey rainy days, etc.\nI think there's only one track in the game so far (other than the sound effects), but I still haven't gotten sick of it.\nThe variety of neon lights and trees is great; adds a lot of character to otherwise boring areas.\nThe geometric rippling-water effect. 10/10 could watch all day.\nGameplay itself is already quite polished- simple enough to focus on design/aesthetics if desired, and complex enough in challenge mode that I had to play a few of them over again to win. It's a simple game but not as easy as it looks. I found myself doing mental math for maximum efficiency. This game made me do math.\nSUGGESTIONS\nI'm sure the dev(s) have considered all or most of the following ideas, or are already working on implementing them, or are planning to take the game in a different direction, but I like to feel important and helpful so here we go!\nI'd like to give my towns/citys/neighborhoods their own names, and have customizable signs to remind me. It gives each one a certain flavour, you know?\nMany of my games have an industrial feel. I end up filling a lot of space with algae farms and generators and garbage dumps, which can make it look like an industrial complex rather than a town. One possible solution (if this is even a problem; some people probably like the look) is to allow buildings to be upgraded to make them more efficient once the player has enough money. Or perhaps introduce another resource (like renown or something) to allow the player to upgrade at a slower pace, since this could potentialy make the game too easy- part of the challenge is the space constraint.\nI wasn't sure how to complete a few of the challenges. On one level I didn't know whether to produce 1000 individual consumers (I'd have to place over 300 neon signs!) or 1000 aggregated "units" of consumers. Or maybe I'm just dumb :(\nCertain pillars/supports should be placeable on existing surfaces such as short trees, sand, grass, etc.\nThe option to click on the background and drag to change viewing angle.\nAs another reviewer mentioned, the player should be able to access saved files from the main menu.\nIt's difficult/impossible to remove or replace a block below another, without first destroying the upper block. Also, blocks are easily hidden if they're surrounded by others, making it difficult to count how many more you need for a challenge, or see if any buildings have broken down. Being able to chose a level and edit it individually, perhaps with the other levels faded out, might be a potential solution. I realize that giving the player too much freedom would result in impossible floating cities (but is that really a bad thing?!)\nDevs are already taking steps in this direction, but I'd love to see more styles/recolours/themes for buildings and blocks -in a drop down menu- that don't necessarily change the stats, just the appearance. Some would be quite simple to create too- for example, a solar panel on the sandy surface that's already in the game, in addition to the grassy surface. Also, condensing the neon signs into one button (with a drop down menu to choose from the multiple signs) would free up space if needed. Again, this is probably an obvious suggestion.\nIt'd be fun to see little blocky people walking around, maintaining the generators, walking their dogs, drinking at the pub- but of course this would be a massive undertaking, and since the game is focused more on architecture and resource management than people, it's definitely not needed or expected.\nBlock'hood is already fun (and worth the price, in my opinion), which is pretty amazing for a game released less than a week ago on early access. It has so much potential, and I'm excited to see where the devs take it!","March 16","true","13.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It is a city builder, however it is not the high resource sucking type like Sim City or Cities Skylines as there are no individual units bouncing around your screen going place to place finding food or taking a dump only to miss and clog up your processor. Currently it plays mostly like a quiet puzzle piece type game where you manage the different aspects of living but if the needs are not met the buildings actually decay. Block’hood is a tower/city simulator and a lot of careful work has gone into creating it, however it is not short of frustrating and a bit on the clunky navigation side as you will actually have to mouse to the camera controls and tinker before finding the perfect adjustment to fit your instant needs (I think they fixed most of it in later updates). It has a great Sandbox mode as it still remains challenging even while giving you plenty of opportunity to explore each item in the menus.\n\nAll in all I believe Block’hood has high potential and I hope the developer sticks with it and listens to the community while building it from where it is now in it’s Alpha stage. I recommend buying this game while it’s on Early Access and give it a try as it is on Steam for 9.99. I give this game a 4 out of 5 for graphics quality, game play and over all potential of this game to become a work of art.\n\nDebatable_Genius\n\nhttps://debatablogblog.wordpress.com/category/games/","May 11","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unfortunately though, it's not very playable in its current state, so I can't recommend it.\n\nWhile conceptually interesting, the interface is still very clunky and unintuitive:\nThere are no notifications or visualizations of everything working, so if a building isn't producing you'll have to click through its production chain to find why.\n\nThe camera controls are very unintuitive and not mouse-based, so a hand on the keyboard or frequent menu-hopping is required.\n\nThe isometric perspective, while neat, gives a pretty bad overview of the mostly vertical map. Only being able to rotate the camera in 90-degree steps doesn't help either.\n\nThe controls in general are hard to get into, with one of the more egregious issues being that you have to hold the button down for a second or so to place a block, but the delete tool works instantly.\n\nChanging tools requires clicking in the interface, which is a bit weird since there are only like three in total. They could all be permanently bound to mouse buttons.\n\nThe colour scheme, while nice and cheerful, does not help with identifying what cube does what. It's no issue for items with specific shapes (like windmills or water towers), but when you've built several offices/schools/apartments near eachother, they're a bit hard to distinguish.\nI think this can turn out great with a few quality-of-life changes, because the core of a great game is already here. All it needs is some more love, which it looks like it's getting. I have high hopes, but cannot recommend as of now.","May 12","false","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No hand-holding, no guidelines, no real rules. It is a sandbox in the truest form albeit it is somewhat limited as to what you can use to create, though that's not to say it lacks in content.

This review will be a bit lengthy in itself, so I'll break down each aspect by part.\n\nVISUALS (+)\nThis game, even if you don't consider it early access, is gorgeous. From the main menu, to the actual gameplay--absolutely beautiful. For those of you looking for a game that is not only fun to play, but has a grand theme to the visuals, this one is for you. In a way, it takes the cake for any "block" related aesthetic theme, as everything is just so smooth (sorry MineCraft). Every block can go and fit in just about every combination you can think of, give or take the limits in preventing decay and the like. So in this realm, well done.\n\nGAMEPLAY (+)\nOne of the most important aspects in a game is if it actually lives up to its hipe, and is actually fun to play. I can say that, for the mostpart, Block'hood is a blast. It's a great challenge at some points, and a relaxing experience at others. Overall, everything will run smoothly and nothing is "too difficult". This would definitely be a game you could use to pass the time, if otherwise not splurge onto if you're into creating multiple save-files. I'd have to rank Sandbox mode as being the best mode to play on, as I'm not one for challenges in the first place--no matter how interesting. Being able to create your own world without certain tasks needing to be fulfilled is a very enjoyable experience. I'm sure the challenges can be fun too, if you are into that sort of thing.\n\nCONTROLS, OPTIONS, & SETUP (+)\nI wouldn't say that the game is the hardest to control, as most things are pretty straightforward. There's a nice setup of controls on the bottom of your screen--in a place that doesn't subtract from viewing your 'hood. There are also explanations of every action or different viewing standpoint in a basic sense, which is a good addition. The menu has a simplistic setting that does not make it difficult to traverse through, and there are options you are able to control from said menu. Saving is also a synch, and literally all it takes is a simple click to a save slot to finish up.\n\nNow that all of the positive is out of the way--here's my explanation for why I'm giving this game a negative review. Keep in mind, that if there was a 'neutral' option, I would have chosen it. However, because of the following reasons, I'm going to have to side with negative.\n\nBUGS & GLITCHES (-)\nBeing an early access game, you can expect to find these. The worst I've heard of would be the game crashing--but I have yet to experience this. The worst would have to be the fact that when I open up a game file, I have to do so twice since the first time it loads the file appears corrupted and everything is switched around. Not the worst thing in the world, but a bit annoying since this tacks on another 3 minutes of waiting for my game to load. In short--expect bugs as long as the game remains in early access. Hopefully this will not carry over to its full release.\n\nSPEED & SETUP (-)\nI wanted to put setup & speed along with each other unlike I did previously because the problems in these areas coexist. You would expect the game to slow with the more blocks you add, but I have yet to witness this problem (may be because my laptop is up to date with every software you can think of, but I digress). Instead, the loading wait times are a bit of a bore. I can understand if its a large sandbox file--but a simple tutorial? Combined with the glitch I spoke of in the past paragraph, it can take a good 3-6 minutes to load my file on some days. In terms of setup--I'd like to specifically talk about the Main Menu, or at least the opening to the game. The credits/logos, for lack of a better term, take a good 2 minutes to run through, which can be a bit annoying. On the first run-through, I totally get it. But there should be a way to click past these every time afterwards, especially when it takes a while for the main menu to "boot up", for lack of a better term. All in all, it takes me 5-8 minutes to load up my save file thanks to these setbacks.\n\nOVERALL GAMEPLAY (-)\nHere is where I want to talk about the big falts--from controls, limits, etc. First off the plate; block limits. 700 seems pretty high up there, but in all honesty, its far from it. My save file contains the largest map, and I planned on creating a large, 15 story utopia of a 'hood. However, that's far from even possible. Try 5 story on the highest point in my map, and I'm unable to place down another block. I can understand if this is to prevent the game from moving slowly--but there should at least be the option to allow for far more blocks than 700. Now, this could just be an early access feature, but still--It's pathetic. This limit is ultimately what took away from what was originally an enjoyable experience, and I can't say that I will play much more of Block'hood unless this changes.\nContinuing onward--the controls in terms of viewing your 'hood, while simple in mindset, are not executed well in this game. You can rotate from the 4 different perspective points, zoom in & out, slightly shifting the viewpoint, and up and down. No side to side, no 'drag the screen'--nothing like that. This might sound nit-picky, and in a way it is, but there are times where placing some blocks can be very difficult without a viewing system that flows. Changing how many levels of your 'hood you see can help, but there really isn't an excuse of adding an unbound viewing system.\nFinally, another aspect of the game that I've seen many complain about is locating blocks than give or take a certain input/output. Some blocks do 1-2, or even 3-4, and some have none of either output or input! But when you're in a dire situation of needing a specific resource, and your scrolling through block after block to find the right one--now that's frustrating. Narrowing down the decay source from certain blocks isn't as difficult as this when using the viewing feature, but I wouldn't mind some sort of guide to tell you what blocks give/take which items.\n\nTUTORIALS & CHALLENGES (-)\nNow, I've already said I'm not a challenge sort of person, but I've got to give some sort of two cents in this area. I'll be honest; the challenges are basically a continuation of the tutorials. I know that there are plans in the motion to create more challenges, but the ones already in the game aren't too difficult if you understand the game. Even so, the wait-time to complete some challenges is pitiful. There should be a fastforward option, at least in the challege areas, to speed things along, as otherwise these challenges are quite dull--even if you love challenges in the first place. Since this might change eventually, I wouldn't worry too much on this front, but it is something to note for the time being.\nAs for tutorials, the system is a bit...odd? The tutorials are helpful and simple, don't get me wrong, but the fact that some are broken up into tiny segemnts is a bit...strange. Waiting for them to load on and off after it only takes you a minute at the most to complete a tutorial is a bit boring to say the least. It wouldn't hurt just to mix the tutorials into 4 main parts, instead of leaving 10+ of them.\n\nIn conclusion--the game is great for a start, but things like block limits really turned me off to the experience. If these get removed, you can bet that I'll be able to knock on another 7.6hrs, but until then, it's going back on my shelf. I recommend waiting on the full release to spend your $10, unless these aspects don't bother you.","May 31","false","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This means that your apartment will be constantly falling apart around you if you can't keep up with the new requirements that each addition brings to your block. I've seen a couple of complaints about this, but I think it's a great design choice, and helps maintain a healthy tension between an arcade-like juggling of needs, and your desire to take your time as you design to your heart's content.\n\nI have noticed a few rough edges in the UI, but Block'hood has only just been released in Early Access, so it's understandable at this stage. Just little niggles like menu options occasionally disappearing as you try to mouse over to them, or the placement of blocks being slightly unclear, but they're minor issues, or infrequent enough that they don't really detract from the experience.","March 11","true","1.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This city builder differentiates itself from the pack by making it more about resource management than anything else.\n\nBy my count, block'hood has (at the time of reviewing this) about 96 different things you can build to produce resources.  Unlike most games where you build stuff, you don't require the resources at the time of building, rather they're required to output their resources.  Because of this you can rearrange your city as much or as often as you please, as long as you constantly have input for any given building, or it will DECAY!\n\nIn my time with the game I didn't find anything antagonistic, so it really seems to be just about planning and executing.  If that's something you enjoy, and if you're happy with a secondary goal of making something as beautiful as it is self-sustainable, then you'll probably really love this game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uANeCBnrya0","March 11","true","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It got to the point where I felt like I "beat the game"... and to continue playing wasn't about the progressing in skill, but rather to create something aesthetically pleasing. So if you're looking for something really complex, or something that you can sink a ton of hours into, I don't think this is it.\n\nThe main thing that I would like to see is a sense of "life". I don't know if simulated citizens can be added or not - just felt like it would be nice to see people moving around, living their day to day life in the tower that I created.\n\nThat said, it was a fun few hours of tinkering, and I will still give it a postiive review.

This game can amazingly explain the concept of urban ecology - the input and output of different city functions (blocks). Every function is inter-related and adding one more block requires great consideration to prevent its decay or  affecting the operation of other blocks. The combination of blocks is endless and allows great creativity. It's really amazing that the game is being developed by a few staffs. Good work guys and hope to see more new gameplay soon after the official launch!\n\nP.S. The sandbox mode is a bit boring. In future, the game could consider to add a "Specialisation" board which guide the player how to develop a certain type of neighbourhood and get some rewards (special blocks) after they have achieved the goals! Also, the terrain could be more diverse in the future.","March 17","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Step rotating the camera is incredibly annoying and once your societies evolve and turn into really complex structures, you will have a hard time placing or reorganizing things without demolishing half of your buildings to fix an alley.\nI will recommend the game, but the camera needs some work, like panning and free rotation for starters.","May 19","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite this, it's a fun game and although it doesn't claim to have touchscreen support, it still works well.","May 16","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For the moment I don't really have any complaints given how well it works in such an early stage. For the moment it can only get more stuff to play around with.\nThere are however some things I would like to see change, and that is without a doubt the Camera. Step rotating the camera is incredibly annoying and once your societies evolve and turn into really complex structures, you will have a hard time placing or reorganizing things without demolishing half of your buildings to fix an alley.\nI will recommend the game, but the camera needs some work, like panning and free rotation for starters.","May 19","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I get the numbers right but still everything dies on me. It makes no sense at all. Therefore it is no fun.  It is very frustrating when you have built a structure and everything equals out or negates itself out with the correct structures and the right amount of structures only for it to all start flashing red and then collapsing. I get so frustrated that I just kill the entire game and get out of it. It is also very slow to rotate the building, I want it instant, and it is so slow that when you get around to the problem block it is already too late. There are a lot of icons that I don’t understand and that don’t make any sense. You could have more of a resource needed to run a building and yet that building still dies, you create even more of the needed resource to fill the needs of the block and yet it still dies?\nThe tutorial is useless and doesn’t make it any more understanding to learn this game. It’s a waste of time and money.\nI am confused as to why there are over 80% of people that enjoy the game. What am I doing wrong, How do they make it fun and enjoyable?\nLike I said I have tried several times, in fact over 5 hours of trying to work out this game which I think Is quite a reasonable amount of time to try and figure a game out. Obviously I want to like this game but until there’s a much clearer guide or tutorial. I won’t come back to it.\nPerhaps it is that the game is still not complete and it is bugs causing issues on the certain levels I have played either that or it just a bad game. When they release the game I will give it another shot. I really hope that all these bugs and issues are fixed.\nWhat I like about the game and what has kept me wanting to give it a shot is the graphics. Each block is simple and yet when you start to build a structure and after many blocks have been placed it is really beautiful. It is a very creative idea and non-stop action especially for a building game. It keeps you on your feet trying to create a huge building. It’s not overcomplicated and from what I can see should be quite easy to choose the tile you need to create a running structure.\nWhen they have fixed the bugs and issues and provide a better tutorial and guide as to what all the icons mean, I cannot recommend this game. If you are one of the 80% of people who reviewed this game then congratulation to you. I wish I could be one too.","June 3","false","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What I mean by that is that realism applies very well and it can be used in concept for school projects in the idea of sustaining the enviroment. The thing is it can get really irratating, such as buildings can easily get abandoned or destroyed if not thinking it through (this bugs me a lot!) I would like to see in the future a mode where you can creatively build without anything causing effect. I bought this game because I love architecture and maybe you can apply that more to it than just sustaining the enviroment; that will also benefit this game because then a whole larger target audience will open up.  Overall in general I think this game has great potential, but please create different modes so people can enjoy it more (it's very boring, I would say it's in the middle of good and bad)\n\nBasically:\n\n-AT THE MOMENT IT CAN BE IMPROVED SO MUCH MORE\n-PLEASE DO FREE SANDBOX MODE, where nothing applies... meaning that the buildings won't be destroyed if lacking electricity, water etc. For creativity.","May 7","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
