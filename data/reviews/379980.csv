Have you ever been inside a tank?"\n\nOnly this game can turn this question into a sexual innuendo.\n\n9/10\n\nEDIT:\n\nO.K. Actual Review.\n\nOverall, this game was a real surpise for me, since I expected a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ensemble of anime tropes mixed in with only subtle hints of tanks. But the devs, DEVGRU-P, actually made an impressive amount of work into this game, considering their Kickstarter made $4000, and their Patreon is getting about $260 a month for the game. Now, I don't know how much it takes to make a video game, but this seems like a small amount considering the quality of the game so far.\n\nGOOD:\n\nThe Artwork is very reminiscent of a certain God-tier Visual Novel, Katawa Shoujo, which I loved very much, and because of that I consider this a very great part of the game.\n\nHumor in the game is great. If any of you check out the game's community forum, you can get a sneak peak of the dev's humor. The humor is a combination of historic events that took place during WW2, and a bit afterwords and stuff, with refences from popular war movies, Like Full Metal Jacket and the like, and humor pointed more towards tank buffs who know a good bit about tanks and how each one worked during the war.\n\nMultiple routes. Many Visual Novels have multiple routes; it's a staple of the genre. Now of days, the average is 3-4, with maybe a cameo romance route added in. The game has 5. And the devs said they're adding more. FOR FREE.\n\nA potato could run it. I know, "It's a Visual Novel, why the hell wouldn't you be able to run it?!" Well, it's just always good to hear of games that run well on a variety of hardware, especially at launch.\n\nPerverted S@#t. Yeah, its a Visual Novel, it's also a staple to have a bit of perversion in some of them. That's great, but do a lot of Visual Novel devs go about releasing the H-Version patch for anybody who bought the game on steam to use? Not really, but these devs are. Usually you'd have to find a patch on the internet, and hope to God it works, but the devs are making it simple. Kudos for doing that.\n\nBAD:\n\nCurrently I havent figured out how to get fullscreen to work. No biggy, I play these games in windowed mode anyways, but not having fullscreen is kind of a big deal in todays game market. Im assuming this should be an easy thing to do, so I'm not mad about that.\n\nMusic cuts out, or isnt noticeable. The music is alright, it has songs from somewhat notable artists like Kevin Macleod and such, so thats good since the songs included are good. But I feel like the music either cuts out, or just isn't noticeable when I felt like it should have been needed. No big deal, again, but music is important, it adds ambience to the game, and provides some immersion. I still dont know if music not being included in some parts is on purpose, or if I just dont have good hearing, so whatever.\n\nEach Route is short. The 5 characters routes each take about 2 hours, and thats assuming if you dont skip. Which, I'll talk about later. If you do skip, the characters actually unique parts are about an hour? So yeah, kind of short, but 10 hours of gameplay for $10 is OK in my books.\n\nEnding is confusing. So apparently, the endings for almost each character is the same. Thats fine, as long as the parts in between are unique, right? Well, the ending just confused the complete ♥♥♥♥ out of me. Either figure out the ending yourself, or watch a walkthrough, and you might see what I mean.\n\nUGLY:\n\nSkipping is messed up. Visual Novels usually have the ability to skip parts that you've experience before, for the people who just want to experience the unique parts of every characters route. Right now, skipping makes dialouge go by fast, and a little bit later it'll stop the skip at the players choice part. The bad thing is, after you make your choice, THE GAME CONTINUES SKIPPING DIALOUGE. I don't know if maybe I just messed up skipping or something, but this is really bad. I missed bits of dialouge because of this, and its annoying. The only way to make it so dialouge isnt skipped after making a choice is to bring up the menu before choosing, and closing it, THEN making your choice. So yeah, thats messed up? I'm just used to it stopping the skip function after you make your choice, and you can choose to skip portions of the game that youve experience before already.\n\nNo ability to bring up steam overlay, or take screenshots. This is another that I can't figure out. I'm guessing because there is no fullscreen, steam overlay isn't allowed, and so because of that you cant tak steam screenshots? Some people must of figured it out, since they've uploaded pictures, but I still dont know.\n\nNo ability to view pictures from the game. Usually Visual Novels allow you to view the important pictures that you've experienced from a completed route (This usually includes the H-scenes, and other lewd scenes, which most people use this function for, but it can also include the background art and extra stuff.) so you dont have to remember to screenshot whenever you want to keep a scene or for when you forget something, or just for your viewing pleasure. This is also important, AND THIS IS A WELL BIG THING. Without this, Players will either have to replay an entire route, and try the skip mechanic in order to view pictures or scenes, OR will have to scan the internet in order to find a favorite scene or pic. This is just a big problem that I can't forgive, because I need to be able to keep photos for later, for science of course.\n\nOVERALL: 9/10 for the actual game, 7/10 for the game including its features and mechanics.\n\nMost of the problems associated with the game are either bugs, developer oversights (I hope), or is something somewhat negligible. I usually grade games by their value in terms of how much fun I had with them, and this game I had fun with. Your first playthrough will be great because you won't have to deal with skip mechanics and ♥♥♥♥, but your next few will be annoying if you want to skip the non-unique parts of the game. Overall, give the game a chance if you enjoy Visual Novels, because this is a truly original game that had the balls to make fun of an internet meme enough to make a game parodying it.","March 9","true","2.5"," 914 of 1,033 people (88%) found this review helpful 883 people found this review funny","88","914","1","883","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Baman/recommended/379980/","Baman","Bamannr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Baman/","1318 products in account","This game gives you the choice of riding a variety of tanks. You have to choose your tank wisely, as each one has their strengths and weaknesses depending on the terrain and situation.\n\nFor example, the M4 is a very versatile medium tank with a 75mm gun, and although it's armour isn't particularly strong, a skilled commander can utilize it's sloped surfaces and rounded turret for maximum effect. Meanwhile, the T34 has great sloped armour and wide tracks for effective traverse in rough terrain, but lacks the more sophisticated equipment and reliability of the Pz.IV. Of course, choosing the legendary Tiger I might be tempting with it's great 88mm and thick front armour, but you have to be mindful of it's unreliable engine.\n\nI have to admit though, that the selection of tanks could, and should have been greater. There are several other NPC tanks that you will meet through the game, like the Maus and the B1, but unfortunately you don't get to drive them. The areas in the game are also not as varied as they could have been, but includes a beach, a mountain and several urban areas.\n\nHowever, despite it's shortcomings, this is a very charming tank simulator.","March 10","true","3.6"," 367 of 399 people (92%) found this review helpful 447 people found this review funny","92","367","399","447","2"

The historical jokes are spot on and well written and there are many references to the strengths and weaknesses of the tanks these girls represent.  The whole VN has a great humorous vibe and sucks you in with smart humor.  However after two hours, just when any other VN like this would be starting to get deep, the game abruptly ends no matter what choices you have made up until that point.  It's as if the writers finished the first couple chapters of a five chapter VN and decided to just murder the PC so they could release an unfinished game.  If the content of this game is ever finished rest assured though I will change this review to a positive one right away.","March 29","false","2.4"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","35","39","2","5"

You must search around trying to find the place, but when you do find the place things aren’t as you imagined. From there the game turns wild. The developer supplied a review copy for me.\n\nI spent around 3 hours playing the game. There are 5 romance routes, but depending on your choice early then you may have an early ending. Each playthrough takes around 2 hours-2 hours 30 mins. I don't want to talk too deeply about the story but it's pretty wacky (in a bizarre sense) and there were always new surprises around each corner.\n\n\nPositives\n\nChoices – A lot of VN’s miss out on this part, they forget to let the reader have choices and gladly this game has an array of choices to choose from.\nMusic – The music is well chosen and goes well with the game.\nPretty creative and confusing – The game is highly creative, somehow associating vehicles with humans and managing to combine them.\nFunny and didnt stop suprising me – Right from the start the ‘wackiness’ of the game had me laughing, especially the crazy drill sergeant. The game didn’t stop surprising me and the scenarios I encountered kept me laughing for a while.\nArt style is pretty good considering it's an indie game – Most indie VN’s I have played have had a more rougher art style but this game has pretty nice art and an abundance of backdrops keeping the game fresh.\n“Ammo Racks, Armored Plating and Amphibious attachments” – The game is completely riddled with Innuendos and most of the times I could not help but facepalm and laugh at what I was reading.\n\nNegatives\n\nSpelling errors – At the beginning there were a few spelling errors but nothing that major.\nOnly 5 save slots – This limits you to how many saves you can have. This can be a minor for most who love to save often.\nstory crossing – This may be wrong but t34 give me number on hill then next day in class she had to give me her number again apparently and was reluctant about it.\nLack of audio options and customisation – There are no real settings in options like audio sliders or font text.\n\n\nOverall, I had a lot of fun with this game. Mostly due to the innuendos and randomness that the game is. It made me laugh quite often and I could easily recommend it to gamers who are looking for a game which is a bit more extraordinaire and bizarre. The price is a tad high but if you feel it’s not that much of a dent on your wallet then go for it.\n\nThe only qualm I have with this game is that sometimes I felt like my choices were not really remembered at all. I did have a fun time though and again, this was a real funny game.\n","March 10","true","3.1"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","86","37","43","8","0"

But when he arrives, Erwin realizes it's not Tank School, but "Tank School" for World War II Tanks. Who happen to look just like Japanese School Girls...!\nInstead of studying military history and doctrine, he's in "Basic Artillery Computations for Fire Support 101", and "Radio Operations 214". Will he win the heart of the tank-girls, or end up as cannon fodder? Only you can decide in, "Panzermadels: Tank Dating Simulator".\nPanzermadels is made by 'DEVGRU-P' a small team of American developers in the style of a traditional Japanese Visual Novel. Unabashedly goofy, the game takes every trope you know from visual novels, and puts a distinctly Tank-Related twist on them! With six different romance plot-lines and a multiple of endings based on your choices, Panzermadels will keep you entertained for a number of playthroughs!\n\nMy opinion :\n\nPanzer Models: Tank Simulator Dating're not a court or play long it lasted a very good life about two three hours a really catchy story of the beginning I felt like a mix between girl und Panzer and kancolle that and really nice .They Are I think a lot of character over games we meet more and more like the maus, JS-2 I, Char B1 really appreciated the model of character especially that of Tiger 1 , m4 sherman and Char B1 there are also a lot of interesting or funny moment as when aprend is that it is the blitzkrieg or even any kind of place otherwise the game and really beautiful there is no problem if finally a screen capture sound imposible and plien screenshot either way but it does not prevent to play .A big strong point of the game music remix music Panzerlied that I was r'appel was used by divion panzer during the Second World War and State Anthem of the Soviet Union in great gg music are just perfect\n\nPanzer IV : is your average teenage tank, she likes sweets, pop music, and Anschlussing Eastern European nations. She does well in school and her favorite subject is History. She secretly loves Polka music, but doesn't tell the other Panzermadels. She has an older cousin, Tiger I, and they're the best of friends!\n\nTiger I : is the richest tank in school, but she's also shy and breaks down a lot of she works too hard. She doesn't do as well in school, but always tries her best. When she isn't in class, she likes shopping for new armored skirts, and other accessories. She loves her younger cousin, Panzer IV with all her heart!\n\nT-34 : is the shortest tank in school. Sometimes she can act tough to make up for it, but deep down she loves her friends. Her favorite food is Borscht Soup, and has every CD from the Soviet Army Choir. She has a cousin, IS-2, but they don't talk much.\n\nIS-2 : doesn't hang out with the other tanks, and is very shy. She's the newest tank at the school and writes home to her uncle, or spends time alone in the library when she's not in class\n\nM4 Sherman : comes from America and is the most active of all the tanks. She can't stand sitting in class, and would rather be outside on the firing line listening to classic rock while training. She's a bit of a tomboy, and is late for class almost every day, to the annoyance of Sergeant Heartmann.\n\nGunnery Sergeant : Heartmann is the home room teacher for the tanks. He can be very strict with all of them, and butts heads with M4 Sherman almost every day over her coming to class late or not wearing her uniform properly. His favorite film of all time is "Full Metal Overcoat"\n\nThème :\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vb5GH6K8pY\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPuEVeUaJTk\n\nConclusion :\nfor a game was 9 euro and a lifespan as long (2 hours) I find its not abused the model of the music perssonage are very well done I have no na dir a very good story rassenblant more style more there is very little visual novel style Modial second war","March 13","true","2.8"," 44 of 61 people (72%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","72","44","61","13","3"

(or you're just shot if no girl comes to help you.) the fact that there's almost no difference with any of the endings is what really upset me and got me to stop playing the game, otherwise, if there were unique endings, i gladly would've played it again for any of the girls.\n\nrecommendations to the devs:\n- change the ending. the ending sucks. i'm sentenced to death for making sweet glorious love to that steely posterior, and i don't get to live the rest of my life with my tankwife? not a good ending. give the girls separate endings along with cgs at the end, and i'll replay it for every single character released.  (or at least have yandere tank come in and defend me instead of abandoning my ♥♥♥ last minute)\n- make a cg gallery option, so i can go back and view glorious tank ♥♥♥ again without replaying the route entirely and so i can remember which routes i played and which i haven't.\n- options menu where i can control text speed, music on/off, skip previously viewed text, etc, etc. there are some awkward moments  where there's no music whatsoever and i feel like playing my own music, but then it suddenly cuts back in.\n- (optional) trading cards and wallpaper for our steam profile to display waifus. emoticons are nice too. who knows when i need to express my emotions through a picture of i-20?\n\nfinale:\ndo i recommend the game? hell yeah i do. ride that glorious tank ♥♥♥ to destiny, my friends. but there's still room for improvement and i think it could be upped with patches, definitely. the game's not for everyone and you have to have a thick skin to laugh at some of the jokes based on war tragedy but it's about as bad as, say, a female-based version of hetalia, so, y'know. if you're okay with it with hot guys, hot girls isn't much different.","March 16","true","3.6"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","95","19","20","8","1"

It's quite silly and shouldn't be taken seriously. There seems to be inspiration from Kancolle and Girls und Panzer as well, with the mention of tankery. I think this game is an in between for me, I like it but I feel there is a lot to be worked on or just plain missing. The options menu is pretty lacking, only featuring an option to hide the message or skip. I would have liked to see a text speed option. A severe lack of music, a lot of the game didn't even have a soundtrack in the background, only some parts of the game did. Not that great of writing, seeing the characters start their sentences multiple times with "haha," was just kind of weird. While that is something you see in text conversations, it's not really something that belongs when characters are talking face to face. There is also no gallery where you can view the CG's after you get them, which I feel is a big feature of VN's and it's not good that it isn't there. Personally I was expecting something a bit more in depth. Perhaps that is my own fault, but after playing other VN's that are silly, such as Hatoful Boyfriend, I feel that this VN is lacking and needed a bit more work. For what it is I also feel that the price is a bit much. $5 would be more reasonable for this game.\n\nAll in all, the game is silly and has plenty of history jokes, but it lacks in actual depth and never seems to tred beyond its silliness into something that is actually enjoyable and not boring after a while. I was actually excited for this when I heard of it. I love tanks and anything WW2 related but I also enjoy VN's. So to be a bit disappointed by it is a bit of a shame. For the person who just wants a good laugh this might work, but if you're coming for something that actually stays interesting then I'd look somewhere else.","March 9","false","1.5"," 145 of 259 people (56%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","56","145","259","10","1"

Also there seems to be at least 5 choices that don't have any effect and the Tiger 1 line has a paradox (I guess thats what you call it) where the same thing you had the option to ask about earlier comes back into the conversation like it was never talked about before.\n\nHonestly this game is very fun and if they were to fix some flaws and extend the story by another hour or two this would be a great game. I did notice that some options seem like they could lead to other datable tanks if they do decide to release dlc like I heard somewhere so what I talked about may be obsolete at that point.\n\nRight now it feels worth the ten bucks for the sheer amount of times I nearly fell over laughing. Don't get it if you're easily offended though. There is a jew joke. ;)","April 8","true","6.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","9","10","4","2"

Also save often because I ran into 1 crash and 1 graphical ♥♥♥♥ up that lasted the whole game and while I'm talking about graphics there is no full screen.\nWith that said I found this game hilarious(like really really really hilarious), a little shorter than I thought but it doesn't waste a second.

It's more focused on memes and corny jokes than it is any kind of story or character development. It felt very jumbled up and hastily put together. I suppose it really didn't need to be well put together seeing how this game is immensly popular with the "LOL SO LMFAO" crowd.\n\nIf you make YouTube videos, buy this game and play it in full, you'll get a billion views and a couple huge checks.\nIf you're like me and like quality VNs, save yourself the $10 and pick up School Days or If My Heart Had Wings, they'll give you much more bang for your buck.","April 9","false","1.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

No happy endings no happy scenes like you think, just a hour of choices then death, so unless you like games with no right option or exciting moments, avoid it, if you do like those things than have at it. And the one other "normal" charecter is just literally Gunnary Seargent Hartmann with a different name like they had no originality past the the title of the game. What I learned from this is that relationships will get you killed.  At the end they say that they would have released it sooner but the TSA screwed up, If they made the game longer and not depressing I would recommend it tomorrow, but as it stands if you want this sort of thing go on amazon and buy Girls und Panzer, it's got better humor and the 4 books are longer than the game read wise and one episode is longer than the time it takes to play the game, hell in a few hours I played it twice.

I must say that I do enjoy the overall theme of the game and the tank innuendo is a nice touch.  The only real issues I have with the game are all in the user interface.\n\nPros:\n-nice humor\n-tanks all have flaws based on the tank models they were designed after\n-reasonably priced for the content you get\n\ncons:\n-to scroll through the text you need to click the mouse button.  To the best of my knowledge this cant be rebound.  My personal preferance is to either use the mouse wheel or the down button and the constant need to click is annoying to me (though I know that is just personal taste)\n\n-I haven't found a way to go back in a conversation.  In most games like this you can press either the up button or spin the mouse wheel up to read past parts of a conversation.  I personally like this feature encase i missed part of a joke.\n\n-As far as I can tell there is no full screen mode.  (again personal preference)\n\n_lastly there is no option to change text speed.  The current speed is ok but I find that I tend to read faster than the scrolling allows.  This can be remedied with a double click of the mouse but it simply feels like an extra step.\n\nAll in all it is a nice game that I feel just needs so minor tweaks that can be remedied with a better options screen.  This is a purchase that was worth my money and will be looking for future games from DEVGRU-P","March 13","true","7.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The whole ending was a major dissapointment, and my viewpoint on that will never change.\n\nMultiple spelling mistakes during the First Date with M4 Sherman however, quite annoying.\n\nBut it is as they say, its not about the destination, its about the journey\nJourney was fun, destination nullified it. Overall, the ending ruined it for me.\nIf i wanted to re-experience painfully poor endings, i'd play Bioshock Infinite or Mass Effect 3 Again\n\n\nIf they ever released a DLC that fixed the ending up, id gladly buy it, even if it ended up being 5 or 6 dollars, it'd be worth it to have a reason to replay this game. again.","March 29","true","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It was really fun/funny.

Nextly, if you don't know alot about wwii/ the cold war, you are going to miss out on a HUGE amount of humor in this game. for sure the strongest aspect of this game are the technical references and historical references, which are true and factual, woven into a reality they were never meant to be in...that IS the prevailing joke...so if you don't know, for example, that certain german tanks had transmission issues, you are missing out on a joke....and there are hundreds of these style jokes in here. Lastly, the trbunal ending thing was a cheap way out to a very abrupt and unresolved ending. TERRIBLE ending. So the main portion of the game was really fun/funny and well researched, game is too short for $10, and the end was  abrupt and terrible.

All of the characters feel a bit stereotypical, but funny. I went the route with Panzer IV and had a blast. Heck, the whole game was fun! But, I completed the story line in a few hours, and for $10, felt a bit on the overpriced side. I couldn't get the game to go fullscreen, however, my PC is garbage and can sometimes barely handle TF2, so it was probably my fault. Wait for it to go on sale. The ending, though, is a bit of a disappointment. If you have some spare money, and the game's on sale, buy it. Otherwise, just wait for a price drop. I hope the developers return to the series, or change the ending if you go the Panzer IV route because it was a good chuckle and laugh, and I really did care about her, and the others.

Yes. Very much yes. Penetrate some armor and enjoy a very 'internet'-style humor. If you aren't a tank buff, you might learn a thing or two. Just don't expect a very fufilling (or good) ending.\n\nSpoiler-free review\nSo, bought this game after eyeing it for its absurdity and strange nature. Came into a bit of expendable money, so I grabbed it. I laughed the whole way through and enjoyed it more than I thought I would, lost track of time and had a great time with all the humor, which can be very dark at times (I will describe one of the times that sprung to mind in the spoilerific review below). I was taken by the charm it had, even if it wasn't perfect in execution which I was willing to overlook when they came up. The problem I had was the same as many of the other reviews; the ending. It took me out of the experience and just killed the steam I had, at least at the time of writing this... I may likely pick it back up to see what other options it has to offer.\n\nThis part of the review will involve the spoilers. Proceed at your own risk.\nWhen I started the game, I had never played a dating sim because they never really interested me, but as anyone that looks at my library will see, I love the little oddballs when I can find or get them. The first half hour, I was mostly trying to figure out the details of what everything was about. The rest of the time, I was rather pleased to fall into the jokes and the charm I spoke of earlier - You're sent to check on the German tanks by the VP to make sure they're not summoning the elder gods again. Which is precicely what they were up to, and the entire scene made me grin like an idiot. You suggest they take up a bake sale, which you regret near instantly.. WW2 era tanks and ovens apparently don't mix well. That entire scene was one of my favorite of all the humor because of how it unfolded; they needed money for a class trip and their first thought was to dive head first into the occult, summon the elder gods for money or weapons which led into holocaust jokes. A bit of the charm I spoke of earlier that just endeared itself to me. All is great even after the hot springs (Where I somehow ended up spending the night with a super tank).\n\nNow, again, I loved the gameplay and was able to forgive the oversights for what the game was. As I've said before, the end completely took the steam out of my sails with the abrupt and honestly... Compeltely lazy way it was handled. I get that it's supposed to lampoon the dating genre and maybe I'm missing some vital element here since i've never played any other dating sim but... What the hell happened? All of the charm, all of the humor... All of it was tossed in the trash bin the moment you get your tank girl. Suddenly, you're drug to a kangaroo court where, for some reason Heartmann is your lawyer and its his first case. The judge decides you're guilty from the moment you step into the room, but the girl you romanced comes to your defense (Or not at all, in IS-2's case). The whole thing of going AWOL is... Slightly hinted at in the very beginning but it's dropped when Heartmann cuts you off from talking to the school's admin. Even if you manage to beat the AWOL charges, you still get slammed with fornicating with a military vehicle which Heartmann publicly denounces and pretty much signs your guilty verdict there. The entire game, he's been the biggest pervert regarding the tanks and he was the butt of many a joke regarding this, even giving you tank porn at one point (Showing it's sold, publically... Wouldn't it be punishable to even own these things if it was something you can get court marshalled over...?)\n\nI mean I'm probably overthinking a game like this, but again, I really enjoyed the humor and charm it supplied til the sudden end... And it disappointed hard there. I mean if it built up to it, had some more flavor than "Oh ♥♥♥♥, we need to end this game somehow...", I would be much happier about it. Again, I'm probably missing some vital part of this puzzle here in the parody of the dating sim type game, but I don't even care if it was a happy ending. You spend the entirety of the game laughing and getting to like these characters to have it all... Dustbinned to end the game in an almost copy-and-paste ending where all you have done amounts to virtually nothing.\n\n\n?/10 Would likely lay a tank to waste in bed again and stop Panzer from summoning Cthulu again.","April 21","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/monochromalapin/recommended/379980/","monochromalapin","Sasha Nova","http://steamcommunity.com/id/monochromalapin/","114 products in account","tl;dr\nWould I suggest the game? Yes. Very much yes. Penetrate some armor and enjoy a very 'internet'-style humor. If you aren't a tank buff, you might learn a thing or two. Just don't expect a very fufilling (or good) ending.\n\nSpoiler-free review\nSo, bought this game after eyeing it for its absurdity and strange nature. Came into a bit of expendable money, so I grabbed it. I laughed the whole way through and enjoyed it more than I thought I would, lost track of time and had a great time with all the humor, which can be very dark at times (I will describe one of the times that sprung to mind in the spoilerific review below). I was taken by the charm it had, even if it wasn't perfect in execution which I was willing to overlook when they came up. The problem I had was the same as many of the other reviews; the ending. It took me out of the experience and just killed the steam I had, at least at the time of writing this... I may likely pick it back up to see what other options it has to offer.\n\nThis part of the review will involve the spoilers. Proceed at your own risk.\nWhen I started the game, I had never played a dating sim because they never really interested me, but as anyone that looks at my library will see, I love the little oddballs when I can find or get them. The first half hour, I was mostly trying to figure out the details of what everything was about. The rest of the time, I was rather pleased to fall into the jokes and the charm I spoke of earlier - You're sent to check on the German tanks by the VP to make sure they're not summoning the elder gods again. Which is precicely what they were up to, and the entire scene made me grin like an idiot. You suggest they take up a bake sale, which you regret near instantly.. WW2 era tanks and ovens apparently don't mix well. That entire scene was one of my favorite of all the humor because of how it unfolded; they needed money for a class trip and their first thought was to dive head first into the occult, summon the elder gods for money or weapons which led into holocaust jokes. A bit of the charm I spoke of earlier that just endeared itself to me. All is great even after the hot springs (Where I somehow ended up spending the night with a super tank).\n\nNow, again, I loved the gameplay and was able to forgive the oversights for what the game was. As I've said before, the end completely took the steam out of my sails with the abrupt and honestly... Compeltely lazy way it was handled. I get that it's supposed to lampoon the dating genre and maybe I'm missing some vital element here since i've never played any other dating sim but... What the hell happened? All of the charm, all of the humor... All of it was tossed in the trash bin the moment you get your tank girl. Suddenly, you're drug to a kangaroo court where, for some reason Heartmann is your lawyer and its his first case. The judge decides you're guilty from the moment you step into the room, but the girl you romanced comes to your defense (Or not at all, in IS-2's case). The whole thing of going AWOL is... Slightly hinted at in the very beginning but it's dropped when Heartmann cuts you off from talking to the school's admin. Even if you manage to beat the AWOL charges, you still get slammed with fornicating with a military vehicle which Heartmann publicly denounces and pretty much signs your guilty verdict there. The entire game, he's been the biggest pervert regarding the tanks and he was the butt of many a joke regarding this, even giving you tank porn at one point (Showing it's sold, publically... Wouldn't it be punishable to even own these things if it was something you can get court marshalled over...?)\n\nI mean I'm probably overthinking a game like this, but again, I really enjoyed the humor and charm it supplied til the sudden end... And it disappointed hard there. I mean if it built up to it, had some more flavor than "Oh ♥♥♥♥, we need to end this game somehow...", I would be much happier about it. Again, I'm probably missing some vital part of this puzzle here in the parody of the dating sim type game, but I don't even care if it was a happy ending. You spend the entirety of the game laughing and getting to like these characters to have it all... Dustbinned to end the game in an almost copy-and-paste ending where all you have done amounts to virtually nothing.\n\n\n?/10 Would likely lay a tank to waste in bed again and stop Panzer from summoning Cthulu again.","April 21","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are thousands of good visual novels out there, many in which, have very good content.... However.... Panzermadels does and doesn't have that and can be completed within an hour or 30 minutes depending on your reading pace.\n\nPros:\nGood story.\nLots of Likable characters.\nLots of puns and a good laugh.\nTanks, lots of tanks.\n\nCons:\nThe game barely has any BGM, if not none at all.\nThe backdrops weren't that impressive.\nLacks any amount of CG besides one for each route.\nSome scenarios will give information and then completely forget it was told in later scenarios.\nLacks any form of actual character endings.\nForced ending that was pretty bad.\n\nNeutral:\nI would include no voice acting but I've seen cases where this works and doesn't work.\n\nOverall, I think it's a good game but lacks any form of appeal in it's design besides it's characters. If you want to play a game with a decent story to have a good laugh, this is the game for you. Otherwise if anything from the cons turns you away I wouldn't recommend purchasing this at full price. Otherwise the artwork was pretty good for what it offered and was a fun experiance.\n\n7/10 - Too little CG\nThough Steam doesn't allow for a neutral standpoint, I have to down thumbs this.","June 5","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
