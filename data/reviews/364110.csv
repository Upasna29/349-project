What I mean is, the first hours of this game feel pretty lame and are nothing special but not later than reaching higher levels where you can do nice pve instances or cool pvp battles you start to like this game.\n\nMost of the negative reviews only played this game for less than 2 hours which means they didnt even unlock the tripple jump or the ability to "fly".\n\nSo if you have patience and like to unlock more and more features the more you play (you can do alot in this game at higher levels) and like martial arts MMOs this is the prefect game for you...","February 7","true","325.6"," 214 of 246 people (87%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","87","214","246","20","3"

The game looks nice to me. There is a glitch here and there, but it works. I like it. But...\nThis could be a nice movie. Why? Becouse when you watch a movie, you dont have to do anything. You just wait untill you see a battle. In this game, you dont have to do much. You click on the destination in the quest tracker and your character will get there without your help, you click on the NPC/enemy name in quest tracker and your character will talk to it or kill it without your help. I reached level 21 without using a single health or chi potion, my level bar never went under 90%. There is some story in a game, if you like to read, becouse whole game is in japanesse (maybe, or chinesse, im not expert).\n\nSo my verdict: Its nice to watch, but boring to play.","January 31","false","3.2"," 239 of 364 people (66%) found this review helpful 64 people found this review funny","66","239","364","64","18"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmcookiez/recommended/364110/","tmcookiez","<™[-=> Cookiez <=-]™>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmcookiez/","177 products in account","This game follows the story of Laughing in the Wind, written by Louis Cha. You are an average member of a village, suddenly thrusted into the tumultuous world of the martial arts when your village is attacked by the Eminence School.\n\nThere are 10 paths to follow in this game. Shaolin (Male Only), Sun Moon, Wu Tang, Five Venoms (Female Only), Splendor, Zephyr, Harmony, House Tong, Infinty and Emei (Female Only).\n\nThe game basically feels like it could be played on Facebook by just left-cling on the auto-quest links. It's just below average. You could call it a game with no AI.\n\nPROS\n1. Auto Quest Pathing\nJust click on the highlighted word in your quest toolbar and you'll immediately run towards it. You can basically play the game by clicking on the link. There is no need to figure out where to go. Extremely useful but it removes something from the game.\n\n2. Voice Dubbing\nThe Chinese dubbing is pretty good.\n\n3. Early Speed Boost (Mount) + Teleportation\nYou get a mount pretty early in the game at Level 9. It makes moving from point to point much faster. Once you get Teleportation at your school's HQ, it's immensely accelerated.\n\n4. Cut-scenes\nPretty okay in my opinion. The cut-scenes do tell the story pretty well.\n\n5. Semi-Interesting Interactions\nCutting bamboo lets you see the bamboo fall on its side.\n\nCONS\n1. Translation Errors\nThe Chinese to English translation is pretty bad. Ling Hu Chong is spelt Lynhsu Chong. DuGu Qiu Bai is spelt Swordmaster Barrow Saint, Fuzhou is spelt Fugiu, Tian Bo Guang is spelt Tien Boken.\n\n2. Low Player Count in the English Servers\nAbyssmal. I counted barely more than 5 other players.\n\n3. Tiny Graphic Errors\nYour horse cart can disappear into the ground.\n\n4. Punching Bag AI / Lamp Posts\nThe AI just stands around in groups, they don't even have an aggro zone. They basically function as lamp posts.\n\n5. Not As Advertised\nSome of the advertisements are just for show. You can't actually run on the roof tops. It's actually a cut-scene triggered by pressing R.\n\n6. Swimming, No Diving\nYou can swim on the surface of the water but you can't dive down.","March 14","false","2.3"," 47 of 59 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","47","59","5","22"

The graphics are not anything special but you will definitely like the Chinese cities and the nature. There are plenty of schools(classes) you can chose from and you can have fun with pretty much every one of them. The combat is not that bad and you can change between stances (or however you call them) whenever you feel like it. Why did I give it a negative review then?\n\nBecause the game is pretty much a waste of time. The endless grinding is boring and feels like I haven't achieved anything. You can get awesome weapons called Sun and Moon and isn't that great? You're wrong.\nYou need 100 Moon shards to get the moon weapon and 240 sun shards for the Sun weapon. How do you get them? You get only 1 FREE shard a day which means it'll take you 100 days to get one weapon and 240 days for the other weapon.\n\nThe next awful thing is timed events. What does that mean? It means you can only do the events when the game says so. For example only in 11:00-12:00 , 17:00-18:00 , 21:00-22:00. You can't just log in whenever you want and do it whenever you feel like it. I have absolutely no idea why people make events like that give you no choice. Imagine if you're coming back from work and you just want to spend some quality time in the game and do your daily events so you can get some rest later on? You won't be because the game won't let you. You will miss on a lot of the important stuff in the game just because you haven't logged in when the game told you to.\n\nI already mentioned this but I'll say it again. The grinding is awful ...it's just boring and that's pretty much it.\n\nIf you want to try the game you should definitely do it but take it for what it is. Just another game that had a lot of potential but was ruined by the excessive GRIND. GRIND GRIND GRIND.\n","May 5","false","87.3"," 38 of 50 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","38","50","2","0"

If you enjoy the classic martial arts films from such famous directors like Chang Cheh & Tsui Hark, you will LOVE Swordsman.  I have been playing Swordsman since it was in beta, so when I saw it was now on Steam, I immediately downloaded it(again). I've got hundreds of hours playing before it came here to Steam...  Yes, you have to make an Arc account first, but since it's here on Steam now, you don't have to use Arc's clunky interface.\n\nThe plot is the general story of you seeking answers after your village is massacred, and a renegade martial arts faction seeking to eliminate the other schools and take control of the martial world(like some of the KILLER Shaw Bros. studios films of the 70s and 80s!  I saw alot of these in the theatres as a teenager{yes, I am old. LOL} and it was soooooooooo cool.)...  You get to choose from such famous schools of REAL martial arts like Shaolin and Wu tang, and some fantasy schools, like the infamous Five Venoms, and more.  I currently am playing a level 35 Shaolin male character and a level 31 Wu Tang female.\n\nDon't worry about some of the negative reviews - some of these people are obviously not familiar with Asian MMOs.  They ARE different from Western games, but that's NOT a bad thing, just different.  One reviewer couldn't even tell that this game was Chinese, confusing it with Japanese(?!) which is quite a different culture & language, even misspelling both words(and smacking a little racist).  That's like saying Norwegians and Italians are the same because both are European!\n\nIt's a great game.\n\nEDIT:\nThe fact that this is NOT in English was a conscious choice by the US-based devs to retain the feel of those classic kung fu movies, like "36th Chamber of Shaolin" or Jet Li's "Hero", NOT a flaw, as some reviewers above erroneously assumed.  If you've ever seen these types of films in their original language, versus the horrendous dubbing that most of these movies seem to be plagued with, you know that it makes a HUGE difference in the entire feel of the film.\n\nFrankly, if one is not 1.) familiar with Asian MMOs, and 2.) a Chinese martial arts movie fan, you just might not 'get it'.","February 1","true","2.3"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

Tried contacting support and they asked me to change password and tell them what my IP is. After following the instruction, I was asked again why my IP was different from the one I changed my password. I have no idea! I do not own the IP address. Now more than 48 hours there's still no response.\nAs a steam user, I don't feel protected and respected at all. They banned the account for no reason and asking silly questions. Steam games should not behave that way.\nOne more thing, I tried to charge Zen which meant I tried to spend some money in hope my account would be secured by linking up with my Steam account, but again it says "Steam parameter is missing".\nIs this a joke? Having been a Steam users for almost a decade, I haven't experienced anything like this before with any Steam games. Fact is I haven't had any problem with any other Steam games which makes me to contact support.\nI would suggest Arc, aka PerfectWorld, slow down their proceedings to get Swordman on to Steam community and fix up loop holes, or at least clarify their policy and show some respect to the Steam users.

It brings absolutely nothing new to the MMO table. There are better games. Also, you have to deal with this massive tutorial arrow that takes up a tenth of your screen whenever you want to talk to someone / pick up items / interact with something / equip something / breath / exist. It's basically the game's main mechanic. Clicking what the tutorial arrow says to click. I've checked all of the settings to no avail. Can't get rid of the damn thing. The story is fairly interesting I guess. You get to be Mr. Generic Hero and go through a kung-fu kid kind of transition from weak to strong. And by transition I mean like flipping a switch. The only time you can really die while trying to stay alive is during the first tutorial mission. Then the game gives you armor that's 20 times better than your original stuff and you're all like "sup bishes" the next time around. Don't feed perfect world anymore please. Their content just keeps getting worse. Neverwinter was decent at least. This is just unoriginal and uncreative. The only bright side I can see is the 10 different playable classes. Other than that, this game is a quartz stone disguized as a diamond. But don't take my word for it. I've only got like an hour invested in this thing. Please, by all means. Waste part of your life on unfulfillment and boredom. I won't stop you. I will, however, forever see you as a scrub.

Similar to King of Kings 3 in that it is a point and click to move and you use 0-9 to cast spells\n2. WASD to move mouse to attack\n3. (didnt do much research into this mode)\nMany different classes from sword weilders to magic users to people who can use their fists.\nit is based off of a real story, many MMO RPG games put you in the position of "the chosen one" and its only you how can defeat (insert bad Guy here) this game dosen't do that. You do create your own character but you reincarnate somone who would have the same attributes and characteristics as your character in the book.\nCons:\nThe leveling system:\ni could go on for ages about how easy it is to level up, but im not going to because that wouldnt be fair, my main problems with the leveling system is the fact that you level astonishingly quickly i dont like that if the game had a more decient leveling system i would be more for the game.\nThe Enemy Difficulty:\nsimilar to the leveling system it feels like their should be more difficulty but not to the point that you half to go to the first area and grind to even stand a chance (Dark Souls) if the enemies were mor difficult then i could get behind the leveling system making it to where yleveling is a breeze because you need to have more difficulty to make the leveling system work.\nYou are practically invincible:\nsimilar to the enemy difficulty problem if you had stronger enemies that were able to do more damage to me than stubing my toe then i would be okay with this but that is all that happens MMO's aren't suppost to hane enemies and bosses that have no effect you should have some difficulty to your enemies and if you do it would fix a lot of problems that i have with this game\n\nyes i would recommend the game no i wouldn't expect people to play more than 20 minutes and quit becaues of the flawed systems in the games","January 29","true","1.2"," 10 of 27 people (37%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","37","10","27","2","1"

The point of my review, is to say that you need to be patient, find a guild, and then is where the fun starts!, i leveld up to lvl 42 in only 2 weeks, and it is a very fun game to play once you reach level 30, i honestly recommend it,.\nGIVE IT A TRY! :D\n","February 29","true","192.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game itself is beautiful, with decent graphics, but it seems un polished. The combat is clunky, but the story is quite emersive. You do sort of feel like a bit of a bad ♥♥♥. I really wish they would fix the " action combat" its way too difficult and restraining. I plan on giving this the old college try..but so far what keeps me going is the story, and the visuals.","February 29","true","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

THINGS TO KNOW you can block with default "X" and then later get dodging abilites.","February 28","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are nice, the choice of chars are good 10 classes. To be fair you have to play the game a while before saying it is boring like many games it's a slow starter the higher the level the more challenges there are. It is a game that you can play alone or with friends/guilds etc. It has the option if you want to pvp or not at least it gives that option unlike some games.

Look no further, baka-chan cause there's no sugoi to be found here!\nSwordsman is an MMO based around, you guessed it, swords. Now of course, there's other weapons than that but that's not the point.\nNow, I've played a lot of MMOs, and to be honest, this one is mediocre at best. The customization ranges from Vietnamese to Japanese, with some Chinese peope in there too. Don't expect to be able to make an Adolf Hitler model. Now of course, with every "free to play" MMO out there, there's alway some method of hooking you in and making you fork over cash. This one's method is called "world energy". If you like facebook games that require you to log every day, then this if for you. Otherwise, you can't grind well.\nObviously, in my intro, I remarked upon the anime styled fighting. This is a main premise to the game, over-the-top finishing moves. teleporting, energy blasts, and other mumbo jumbo. However, despite having all that, the game still keeps to reality with it's models, making them a tad realistic.\n\n*STORY SPOILERS*\n\nThe story is based off a book, so I can't knock it too much considering I've never read it. However, it still pulls you in decently, albeit getting annoying when you chase the annoying boss down, beat him into the ground, only for him to jump away and then have his buddy curb stomp you in a cutscene. You start out, on the beach, being approached by a villager asking you to stop the bandits from destroying their village. So you set out and kill off the bandits, only to run off and get, you guessed it, curb-stomped in a cutscene.\n\n*BACK TO REVIEW*\n\nNow, the thing is, is of course starting off is a total piece of ####. Leveling is slower than your average 2-legged turtle, and some quests can take ages. However, later into the game it speeds up, giving you access to lots of neat tools and abilites.\n\nI'd personally rate this 5/7.\n\n\n\nOh and the A.I. monsters make really nice statues, considering they never freaking move.","April 7","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
