"http://steamcommunity.com/id/More_Badass/recommended/298280/","More_Badass","More_Badass","http://steamcommunity.com/id/More_Badass/","624 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI originally wrote these impressions in February:\n\n---\nVery rarely do I impulse-buy games. I saw XenoRaptor on TIGForums last night and was instantly intrigued by the crazy description and impressive GIFs. If "a weapon which teleports attack bears into the cockpit of enemy ships" doesn't peak your interest, nothing will. I tried the demo and then purchased the game ten minutes later, I'm a big fan of dual stick shooters and bullet hell mayhem action games, and XenoRaptor does not disappoint.\n\nThe last indie that compelled me to buy it so fast was Broforce and in a similar fashion, XenoRaptor is wild, over-the-top, and just fun. The controls are fluid and very responsive, allowing you to evade enemy fire and enemies themselves with ease. But being able to maneuver with ease doesn't mean the game is easy. The gameplay has the same fast, frenetic, frantic pace of Assault Android Cactus, as bullets and enemies fly in from all angles, and you must constantly stay on the move, rarely given a moment to rest. However, XenoRaptor offers the player far more freedom in terms of gameplay. From engine types to customizing your loadouts to altering your dragons color pattern, you have a wide range of options to mix and match. Want to be a teleporting, mine dropping, laser blade wielding cyberdragon? Or evasive and armed with railgun and chaingun? Or do you want to mind control enemy ships and use your laser like a tractor beam? All those playstyles are equally viable.\n\nXenoRaptor's charm extends to its environments and visuals as well. Controlling a weaponized space dragon mech is just feels more exciting and cooler your usual shmup ship, and better yet, the health and overheat meter is represented Dead Space-style, by lights on your dragon's body, keeping the UI minimal and the screen free of clutter. The backdrop of planet, stars, and asteroid fields are impressive and in some instances play a role in gameplay. Asteroids can be dragged along with your tractor beam or used to funnel enemies through chokepoints so they destroy themselves.\n\nXenoRaptor doesn't just offer hectic single player chaos; you can also play co-operatively and competitively. I haven't tried those modes yet, but they're there for people who enjoy multiplayer. The game is still in beta, with more maps, enemies, bosses, and ship components to come. If you're a fan of arcade shooters, bullet hell fun, and tactical depth, XenoRaptor is right up your alley\n---\n\nSince then, XenoRaptor has only gotten better. New enemies, new bosses, improved and sleeker UI, boss rush mode, new weapons, new levels, flashier visuals. XenoRaptor has earned a spot as my favorite games of 2014 so far, for its so so satisfying gameplay, strategic depth and deep customization, and hectic intense combat. I didn't think any game would surpass Assault Android Cactus as my favorite dual stick bullet hell shooter, but XenoRaptor did. It's fast and fun and frenetic and well worth the price. There's a ton of content even now and only more to come in the future.\n\nMy favorite thing about the game has to be the fact that enemies can hurt each other. It may not seem like a big detail, but it adds so much to the gameplay and opens up numerous tactics and awesome moments. A horde of rocket chainsaws closing in? Dodge at the last moment to make them all destroy each other, or lead them through a chokepoint between asteroids so they tear each other apart as they group together. Bait enemies into shooting each other, mind-control mini-bosses into fighting other enemies...it makes combat so much fun","June 17, 2014","true","2.1"," 50 of 51 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","50","51","0","0"

The game runs perfectly fine and in my opinion this game is a great deal of fun. If you enjoy these type of games you should have no real gripes with this one.\n\n\n\n\nI picked up this title because it reminded me of another indie game that I did not expect much from but in the end impressed me more so then any other game this year, Ring Runner: Flight of the Sages. As I am now a fan of this genre I would have enjoyed this game even if it was only half way decent. That being said I do believe this game holds up on its own. The controls are fine, the gameplay is fast and chaotic and it is challenging.\n\nThe only complaint (and it is a minor one) I have is that there is only one ship that you can pilot. I love having a selection to choose from. I can understand why they might do this though as it makes the game easier to balance. The biggest complaint I had with RR was that some ships simply out classed others rather then having there be trade offs of say like gaining something while losing something else. What would make this game fantastic is if they did have a few more ships though, like say a really light and quick one, a heavly armored slow ship, etc. and make it so no ship is clearly better then others but would give people the ability to specialize even more so.\n\nI don't really know what they plan to add in the future so my complaint might be unfounded.","June 17, 2014","true","18.7"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Technizor/recommended/298280/","Technizor","Technizor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Technizor/","159 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI greatly enjoy top-down shooter games, especially ones like XenoRaptor which are set in space. In general, if you like ridiculous weapons, crazy customization, high-score chasing, and really chaotic gameplay, then you definitely should pick this game up.\n\nGameplay:\nXenoRaptor is a fast-paced twin-stick shooter. The movement of the player's ship feels natural, especially if you are playing with a controller like I was. Aiming is not a problem, and there are 4 skills that the player can use: 2 basic weapons that generate Heat, a special weapon that uses Ammo, and a movement skill that uses Fuel. The number of weapons and combinations that are possible in this game is already varied, and is sure to increase as the developer adds more of them. Each weapon plays out in its own unique way, so there are many styles of gameplay that can be catered to, provided that you can unlock the weapons and modifications first.\nThe enemies are generally combinations of characteristics, for example a fast chainsaw ship that uses a chaingun, which does make the level varied enough that they are not grindy, but similar enough that you can easily tell at a glance what type of enemy you are fighting. The bosses must be defeated in order to unlock weapons and modifications for your ship permanently. Each has a separate drop list and will always drop a new mod until you have acquired all of them. Unfortunately there does not appear to be a way to tell when you have gotten every mod from a specific campaign level until you have defeated both bosses without getting another drop.\nChaotic as the levels are, it would be near impossible to beat the level without the use of power-ups that are dropped occasionally when you kill an enemy. That being said, there are some readability issues with said power-ups that can make it a nuisance. Medkits will fully heal the player's ship to prevent you from dying. Coolant (and all other weapon power-ups) will reset your Heat bar, which if filled will prevent you from firing your basic weapons until it has cooled approximately half of the bar. Ammo, a subset of Coolant, will add Ammo for your special weapon, which can be shot even when you Overheat. Speed drops will replenish your Fuel and make your ship move faster. An important thing to note is that you can overcharge your Health, Fuel, and Heat, but it is not nearly as efficient as its intended usage. Unfortunately, the Medkit and standard Coolant power-ups are both green and about the same size, so they tend to look very similar and can be a bit confusing. While you can look at the minimap because it uses more distinctive icons and even though the game will circle the power-ups that you need urgently, it is still frustating. The Speed power-up, while not as vital as the other two, is very small and hard to see. Again, it appears distinctly on the minimap, but it is a problem nonetheless.\nI have absolutely no clue on what manipulates the score multipler. Generally killing stuff increases it and getting yourself rekt will drop it.\n\nUser Interface:\nCurrently the user interface is very bare-bones: The main menu has a few items, including the Hangar and game modes, but there is no tutorial or additional information that will tell you what power-ups do. While you do get a basic control list when you press F1 in-game, you will need to figure out what everything is and does on your UI.\nThe Hangar is where all of the customization magic occurs. You start out with a very basic set of weapons and mods for your ship and you need to unlock them by beating bosses. It is very nice to have the weapon firing pattern and numerical statistics visible, making it that much easier to make an informed decision about your loadouts. When using a controller, you may run into some problems with controlling the interface, but if you use a mouse and keyboard you will have no problems.\nAs an aside, the start-menu has a very odd textbox that I am not sure of its purpose, and the name submission after you complete or fail a campaign mission will always reset to its default every time you start the game again. Again, not really an issue, since you probably won't be easily getting top ten, but it is a tad bit annoying.\n\nGraphics:\nThe player's ship is customizable and you can see it in your gameplay. Weapons all look unique and the particle effects look great. The enemies all look the same in style, but are very easy to distinguish from different types. Not much to complain about here.\nAs for options, you have several aspect ratios and resolution options. You can also adjust Antialiasing, Anisotropic Filtering, and Texture and Shader Quality.\n\nSound:\nThe sound effects for the weapons are varied and good quality. The background music definitely fits the game's over-the-top space battle aesthetic.\nThere are only 2 volume sliders: Master volume, and Music volume. So while you can turn down the metal music if you do not enjoy that type of music, there is no way to do the opposite if you only wanted to listen to the music.\n\nOther Notes:\nMultiplayer is most definitely unfinished, but it has been explicitly stated by the developer that this is one of the priorities at this stage. I will update this when it is more complete.\n\nOverall:\nAside from some small annoyances with the user interface or just a lack of information on basic game mechanics, XenoRaptor is a great twin-stick shooter experience. With a bit more polish and once multiplayer is full fleshed out, I would whole-hearted recommend this game to anybody that shows a remote interest in this type of game. Right now, it is still worth investment if you want to contribute to the development of the game and deal with a few minor issues.","June 24, 2014","true","6.2"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

Weapon customization is not only varied enough to be meaningful, but features actual stats (such as dps and heat usage) that you can compare to optimize your weapons to the fullest. Sound does its job and the music is pretty good, with graphics and particles being detailed enough without being distracting. Some weapon/ammo discriptions are just amazing. Did I mention that the theme of the enemies is that they are all saws? You can also paint your cyberdragon pretty colors to make it look as badass/stupid as possible. You are also a cyberdragon.\n\nIf you're not convinced this game is worth $15 (it is), download the demo, which lets you endlessly replay the first 3 levels in full. The game even carried over my progress and settings in the demo into the full game, which is amazing and something I wish more games had.","July 4, 2014","true","41.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlmondsActivated/recommended/298280/","AlmondsActivated","Pvt. Ryan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlmondsActivated/","231 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhile simple in concept, I find the gameplay to be honestly pretty addictive. Such a vast wealth of customization provides incentive to really play the game over and over again, which while could be considered "grinding" in some respects, is immensely fun. Scenes are beautiful, as space is naturally quite beautiful.\n\nThe game is immensely difficult in single player terms. I find that getting past the second/third boss in any level is perhaps a near-impossibility. Enemies move fast, some of your own weapons can damage you (which often happen to be the most effective weapons), and your life bar is not truly long at all.\n\nStill, the game could use a few things. A more dynamic and varied soundtrack for one would help immensely, more variation in on-screen structures (perhaps large megastructures that can't be noticably moved by the physics of your weapons) would add to the relatively sparse levels without cluttering the screen with bite-sized asteroids, a larger field of view would help especially for boss sections, as oftentimes the bosses get left in the dust offscreen as you pelt them from afar with a railgun or particle beam. Truly, these serve as a reminder why the game is "early access."\n\nBut overall it's a solid experience. Worth the price for now, but eager anticipation for what it may become is what really entices me.","September 16, 2014","true","2.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The game overall I would rate as a 8 out of 10, it has a pretty diverse soundtrack, even though I havnt gotten past level 3 yet, I still love the 2 songs I have heard, one is a modern, paced kind of sound, and another is like a 16-bit arcade-style music that gets your heart pounding. The music is 6 out of 10, only because of the limited amount I have heard, although there may be more I dont know about. The graphics are great, not too hard on your computer, but not really simple either. Its more like a bunch of simple things that combine too make a big, complex thing. The bullets are easily seen, and the stage hazards are identifiable (oil drums, asteroids, etc), and the stronger foes tend to telegraph their movements with a laser or some sort of symbol, making it easy to see where it goes. I give the graphics a 8 out of ten. The controls are very easy to pick up and play, using a familiar WASD-mouse combo we all know and love. They are responsive,  and everything can be rebound, meaning that you can still use special weapons without a scroll button. I give controls 9 out of 10. The final thing to cover is weaponry. Have you ever wanted the ability to make a weapon the launches twenty nukes that implode, drawing enemies and hazards into them? Now you can, with the user friendly weapon design interface. There are three parts to weapons, which differ depending on your weapon. You can get bombs, gatling guns, railguns, beams, gatling lasers and more, and make all sorts of outlandish (and very effective) weapons, as well as changing your hull,(special weps ammo and heatsink) your radar(distance from ship, and defense) and engine(speed and special ability). I would give this a 10 out of 10. Overall, I would recommend this game, and if you dont mind possibly having a bug or two, I would definately grab this.","January 1, 2015","true","19.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Almost every single thing is deadly to touch and almost every explosion or hit sends you flying away into obstacles. You're supposed to dodge, but dodging into anything removes half your health. Most maps are filled with asteroids and explosives that are flying around at an incredible speed.  Enemies also run into the screen at breakneck pace, to the point where dodging them is a matter of never ever be going in a remotely straight line as you'll simply never see them coming.","May 1, 2015","false","3.0"," 7 of 34 people (21%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","21","7","34","4","6"

The chainsaws function as a beautiful motivation to not get hit, and the skulls are a nice aesthetic touch.\n-The drop rate is just right for every power-up except Speed, which drops slightly too often and ultimately makes it a little easier than it should be in my opinion. I would like to see less of that to force the player to use movement abilities more conservatively.\n-The soundtrack is half-♥♥♥♥♥. It doesn't pollute the experience, but I'm not a fan of it.\n\nOther than that, great game. Give Peter Cleary your money.\n","May 5, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
