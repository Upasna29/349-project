Heat seeking Sidewinders, Radar-seeking Amraams, bombs, and other air to ground rockets, the game offers you a large arsenal to complete a variety of missions that have a gradual incline in difficulty. The AI makes the game pretty challenging, often forcing you to make tactical decisions rather than locking your enemies and firing away. Since you have a small plane with limited rockets, you need to decide if you're going to use the long range rockets on those helos or try to take them out with the gun after you splash those menacing su-27's. Bombing missions are pretty hairy as well, as you have better accuracy at hitting the targets while flying low under flak rather than dropping them from the stratosphere. Dodging enemy missiles is always a difficult thing to do, for me, that's when the butt-clenching begins. Radar missiles can be dodged if you lower the plane beneath 100 meters, but heat seeking missiles are another business... Usually either you find a hill to hide behind, making the rocket to lose your track, either try to maneuver in a long arc to miss you. This is just a taste of the thrill that this game can give you.\n","April 14, 2015","true","1.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Brillaint and underated. If your into jet fighter sims, get it!\nAlways Loved Novalogics fighter games. It does seem a shame that games like this are not being made anymore. The worst example is as a Star Wars fan I loved the X-Wing series, XWA was made over a decade ago now and no signs of another fighter sim to come. Seems the same with novalogic and jet fighter games too :(","July 19, 2013","true","1.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

This is a worthy addition to anyone who enjoys simulators.","July 28, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ancient, arcade-y, a giant pixel-fest, and probably not worth it at $5 let alone $25. At least, unlike F-22, this doesn't just crash when you enter the settings page. Perhaps because this doesn't support 3D accel at all...","January 12, 2014","false","0.2"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","6","20","0","0"

Not only the visuals didn't aged well, the controls aren't intuitive and even properly explained. No tutorial / training mode doesn't help either! The game does support the XBOX 360 gamepad to a point but you would be better of playing this game with Keyboard though. The gameplay is slow and bland/boring. The audio (sound/music) aren't that great either. Also, don't seek out this game for the multiplayer as it is quite dead! Maybe you could play in LAN but I haven't nor I am willing to give it a shot!\n\nPROS:\n+Works on modern computers and XBOX 360 gamepad is supported, but barely!\n+Simulation seems adequate from what I played.\n\nCONS:\n-Dated visuals, graphics.\n-Game doesn't support full screen.\n-Controls aren't very intuitive.\n-No tutorial / training mode so you are left out figuring the controls for yourself.\n-Boring gameplay.\n-Poor audio (sounds and music).\n-While in-game, you can't view/edit the options and even the controls. This is a nasty CON!\n-Dead Multiplayer (to be expected though).\n\nOVERALL:\nI'm sure this game could have been decent back in 1998 but now in 2014, I prefer investing time on more modern games, as should you!\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nI would recommend F-16 Multirole Fighter to flight simulation purists and gamers that dig old school gaming only. As for newcomers, you should stay away and look into modern games instead!\n\nAlso, since you cannot buy a single Novalogic classic and "forced" to buy the Novalogic Classics Volume One: Machines of War package, you better think twice before investing in this as I only found one game worth of purchase, Commanche 4. If you can find this package on a very good and drastic deal, give it a shot. Better, look somewhere else if you can buy a single game at a time.\n\nRATING:\n2.0 / 10","January 4, 2014","false","0.3"," 6 of 23 people (26%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","26","6","23","0","0"
