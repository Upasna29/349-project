I'm playing a female character but all the dialog refers to me as a male. There are misspelled words and some of the jokes are very lame. One of my quests is buggy. But you know what? I don't care!

If you like fantasy settings or card games or stories that poke fun at themselves, you'll probably enjoy this quite a bit. And the best part - the achievements work just fine! If you're thorough in your exploring, it's fairly easy to get a perfect game in one playthrough. So if you don't mind an unpolished game, look for this on sale and snap it up.

I'm a sucker for a good card-battling game and this one doesn't disappoint.  There's an adventure mode and a quick-battle mode where you can pick a character with pre-made decks.  It may not be as refined as a M:tG or Hearthstone card battling game, yet it's simple, straight forward and fun.\n\nYou do quests which will usually net you experience and some gold.  Experience you can use to level up and improve your main stats, and gold naturally lets you go to shops to purchase new cards.  The game does a good job at explaining the basics of how the cards work when you start the game, so don't worry about needing any prior knowledge of card-battling games when going into this.\n\nMy only gripe is that I would have loved it to have a versus mode with multiplayer, but that's a small gripe considering the price and the value I have gotten out of the game already.","August 2, 2014","true","3.9"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","33","39","0","0"

Their power varies mostly in brute stats rather than in interesting effects, and the pool of cards is quite limited. Granted, having only 3 spots for units and 12 for battle cards makes this seem like not such a big deal, and the game is overall short enough that you don't get do play with the same deck for very long stretches.\n\nDuring battle, every character gets one move that can consist of using one of their own abilities or something from your battle deck. There are no casting costs, just one card / character, which means that there is rarely any reason to use low-power cards, and you'll have all your strongest cards in your deck at all times.You goal is to get characters' attack value high enough above an enemy's defense to score as many damage points as possible, and the AI is not extremely potent, rarely focusing down your units, resulting in opponents that are pretty easy to take down, with a bit of luck.\n\nApart from the campaign, there is also a Quick Battle mode where you can play as any of the in-game character classes and use all the cards without having to purchase them first, which is a very nice idea, but unfortunately the lack of multiplayer is something that makes the title a little bit less appealing.\n\nThe graphics in Northmark: Hour of the Wolf are decent enough, nothing very good but not overly bad either, the drawings are generally pretty bland and will not impress in any way. That being said, they're not terrible either, and do a fine job of carrying the game, being in line with its simple nature. The music is also decent enough to work, nothing terribly engaging or epic, but not completely drab either, and just like the graphics, it's functional enough to carry the game.\n\nAlthough the game starts off like a fairly fun experience, it quickly becomes apparent that Northmark: Hour of the Wolf has a few sloppy areas. The card game itself is very simplistic, and the entire game is overall very short, and its story is pretty generic, not to mention the fact that it doesn't go into a meaningful direction, in part due to its small scope. There are not many cards, not many characters, and only a modest amount of interaction, very limited deckbuilding options, for the most part you just go through the motions once you get the hang of the game, and there aren't many things that surprise you.\n\nThe story is good enough but not stellar, and, once you go through it, there is little replay value. The lack of multiplayer also cuts from the life expectancy of Northmark: Hour of the Wolf. It could have done with a stronger design focus, but it's enjoyable enough as it is, if you're looking for a casual card game with a story to tell.","November 8, 2015","true","10.2"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","0"

You do this by traveling around the world map, exploring locations and fighting baddies.\n\nThe card game is fairly simple. You can have up to 3 units, limited by your command points (gained by leveling), and each unit can take one action per turn. An action is playing a card, whether an attack or a boost card. Units have built in cards that you get by clicking their picture, these will refresh after a while. You attempt to get high attack values, so your attack cards will penetrate your opponents' defense values, damage and eventually kill them by reducing their health to 0. There’s both physical attack and a number of different magic attacks, and it’s really impossible to guard effectively against all of them.\n\nSince cards do not have casting costs, only costs to obtain, there is rarely any reason to use lower damage cards, unless they bring some sort of debuff or damage over time effect. You can only have 12 cards in your deck at a time, from about 100 that you can obtain, and since most of them will be lower tier, there is very limited deck construction. Balance is definitely an issue, what with no casting cost, and some of the units are really overpowered. Generally speaking, the 5000 cost cards are the ones worth the price.\n\nThe AI is not anything special, most opponents can be easily overwhelmed if you build a half decent attack heavy deck, with a few buffs and healing thrown in. The sole exception to this is the broken card which switches your hand with your opponent’s. When the AI uses this on your tuned deck, and you get a hand full of crap, there’s a good chance you’ll auto lose.\n\nThere are a number of bugs, ranging from a quest that may become uncompletable to text that doesn’t properly reflect the gender of your character, should you choose the female avatar. For most people I imagine the 4 chapters of the game can be completed in 3-4 hours, less if you’re an experienced CCG player. As you near the end of the game, the English writing gets progressively worse, giving the game an unpolished and unfinished feel. This is further compounded by the ending which doesn’t resolve much.\n\nGraphics and music are decent enough, though there are some issues with the cropping of the character images.\nI would cautiously recommend this game for people in need of a quick CCG or simple RPG fix, but you have to take into account the simplicity of the card game and the short length of the overall game. It starts out fairly fun and refreshing, but once you understand how to best stock your deck and obtain the power cards, the excitement tapers off.","August 3, 2014","true","2.9"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

The card game aspects are fun and solid, it has some nice 'hidden object' mini-games for finding bonus treasure, and you can also solve riddles to open treasure chests. The story is entertaining (even if the main character is 'Lawful Stupid' and can't see through the Jafar-esque villain who gives himself away just by his wardrobe), and it has some nice pacing.\n\nWith that said, it's got some flaws. For starters, it's so short that I thought I had installed a demo when I suddenly completed it. I spent four hours on it, doing a completionist run on my first play through. There is no replay value, so the fact that it's so short is a serious problem. Also of note is a bugged out quest that prevents you from accessing one of the stores in the game. That's not a huge problem, but it does mean you can't get all of the cards and may mess with some builds.\n\nAll told, I'll give this a positive review, but I'd highly recommend picking it up on a heavy sale. Compared to just about every other card game on Steam, this doesn't justify the high price. It's not bad, but you'll beat it the first time through and you'll likely never touch it again.","November 6, 2014","true","4.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The writers tried to be funny and failed.  Other dialogue is dreadfully mediocre and poor at best.  There is very limited strategy to the game.  Most fights are really easy but a few are a bit rough if you tackle them too early unless you spent your points in the right places.  Usually I just buff the snot out of one stompy unit and focus attacks on one enemy unit at a time.  I also couldn't see the point in spending many stat points on defence since the faster I kill off one of the enemy's units the sooner I'd win the fight.  Focus on attack and spread those points around to several different damage types and you're guaranteed to hurt anything you hit - even if only for a few points.\n\nEven though it's not a great game something made me stick with it until I played the whole thing through.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalirion/recommended/307010/","kalirion","kalirion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalirion/","2884 products in account","Northmark is a pretty nice, though very short, single player CCG.\n\nThe actual combat mechanics are different from other CCGs I've played.  There are 4 types of cards - Units(soldiers, etc),  Buffs, Debuffs, and Attacks.   Before the fight starts, you select up to 3 unit cards and 12 of the other cards from you inventory for your deck.  The units start out right on the battlefield - no need to "summon" them, and your "Hand" contains 7 cards randomly selected from your 12 card deck.  As each card is used, it is replaced by another one, and the deck never "runs out."  If your deck contains fewer than 12 cards, the remainder are a random assortment of very weak cards.\n\nUnits have two attributes - Health and Defense.  Defense is subdivided by element - Physical, Magic, Fire, etc.  Every unit in play gets a turn - if you have 1 unit and the enemy has 3, they take 3 turns for every one of yours.  Every unit has at least a couple of cards of its own.  When the unit takes its turn, you can have it use either one of its own cards or one of the 7 cards in your hand.  Its own cards aren't "rotated', but instead put on a cooldown for several turns after use.  Every action uses a card, for example an Attack card needs to be available in order for the unit to attack.\n\nThe goal is to eliminate the enemy's units.  Damage calculation is simple - if your Wolf uses its Wolf Attack card, which does 4 physical damage, against an enemy's Soldier who has 1 physical defense, the result is 3 Hit Points subtracted from the Soldier's health.  Your unit actually gets attack and defense bonuses from your hero's stats, which you increase when you level up, and the enemy has their own bonuses, so if the enemy hero has +3 to defense and you don't have any attack bonuses, the Wolf will not do any damage.  That's where buffs and debuffs can come in - I often found it a useful strategy to have 2 units use their turns to buff up the attack strength of a 3rd unit, which would then rip through any enemy defenses.\n\nThere are no resources like mana or energy in combat - if you have a card in hand, no matter how powerful, any of your units can use it on their turn, so it pays to try to get the most powerful cards you can.  This doesn't quite apply to the units themselves.  Your hero has a "leadership" attribute (which increases either as you level up or as you proceed in the plot, I'm not quite sure,) and each unit has a set level of 1 to 5.  The combine levels of the 3 units fielded in battle cannot be greater than your leadership value, so if you want to use 3 level 5 units, you need leadership to be 15.\n\nWhen you begin a new game, your character will start out with 3 cards specific to your chosen class, including 1 Unit card and 2 cards for your battle deck.  Some of the other cards you will find after combat, in hidden stashes, or be given as part of the plot or reward for completing a quest.  Most cards, however, you will purchase from shops with gold (which is found after combat, in hidden stashes, or given to you as part of the plot or reward for completing a quest.)  Various of the cities you visit have arenas in which you can fight, with no penalty for losing, until you defeat each of the opponents.  The gold rewards for wins are very nice, not to mention the XP gained, so it is highly recommended to do these whenever possible.\n\nThe graphics are serviceable, and the music is very good though there isn't a large variety of tunes.  Interface is decent, with the strange exception of when it comes to modify up deck - clicking on one of the twelve slots  let's you select replacements, but you can only see 3 cards at a time, and have to click the arrows to scroll the 3-card view in any direction, 1 card at a time.  Obviously this can be quite maddening, as your card inventory grows.  You can view your inventory at and see 18 cards to a page, so it makes no sense why a similar large page view can't be used to select the cards for teh battle deck...\n\nAs I stated in the beginning, this game is rather short, too short in my opinion for the $9.99 asking price.  It can be completed in 4 hours, and there's not very much replay value besides seeing how it plays with a different character build (ex. putting all your level up points into Ice Attack and seeing what happens).  While you do get to pick a character and class when starting the story game, these have no effect beyond the couple pre-allocated skill/level points and the 3 cards you start the game with.  And the final boss feels more like a "Saruman" than "Sauron", leaving the the whole story feeling more like a "Part 1".\n\nThere is also a Quick Battle option in the main menu, where you can select a character and level for yourself and the AI, from 13 different types of characters which you might face in the story campaign.   Each of these has their own cards and units, and this is your chance to use some cards which you've only had used against you in the story.\n\nIn the end, due to its short length and lack of multiplayer, I'd recommend this game on a sale.  If you can get it for <$3-4, it's a good value.  For a more "meatier" single player experience, you'd want to look at other titles, like Spectromancer .","August 9, 2014","true","6.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

All in all, defintely a good game to get on sale or in a bundle since the length does not completely justify the price.","August 14, 2014","true","6.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Its really easy though, and seems to be a mobile port. Besides that, its pretty fun. The rules are simple to learn, each stat has an attack and a defense, so like 3 fire magic -2 fire defense is 1 point. Theres basic attack/defense and then ice, fire, and poison. Your hero, of which there is a few classes to determine your starting cards and stats, also has base stats which boost the cards. You wander around a map, each location has little icons you can click (and hidden ones too with gold you have to search for). Theres also riddle chests (like in Betrayal at Krondor, one of the best RPGs of the 90s). The riddles are easy, but fun.\n\nThe combat is all card based. YOu have a group of 12 cards that is your deck, and you can get "unit cards" which have a level. You can pick up to three units, as long as their levels combined isnt above a set number. So if your number is 10, you can have 2 5th level units, or a 5 a 4 and a 1, or 2 4s and a 2, and so forth.\n\nIts really easy to understand and pretty fun - if simple and kind of easy. The only complaint I have is no matter if you pick the obviously female Ice Mage character, all the text refers to you as "he". Annoying.","August 3, 2014","true","2.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Let me tell you why I didn't like this one.\n\nThe card pool is small, and the cards aren't satisfying.  In layman's terms, they just don't do cool things.  They do damage (if you're lucky), they heal a small amount, they have a half-♥♥♥ buff that sort of helps.\n\nThe story is... bad.  And short.\n\nDid I mention the game is short?\n\nThere are no unique scenarios, every fight is pretty much the same.  Whittle the enemy numbers by focusing on one unit at a time.\n\nThere is no SWEET LOOT!  Sometimes you'll get a card or a unit, but like most TCG the majority of the cards are trash and your deck pool is pretty limited.  The units have different stats, some are better than others, but they all function the same.  No fun stuff!\n\nThe starting characters are pretty lame, and there's no replayability.  No customization, the variety of token in nature.  You also don't really level up enough for the stats to even make a strategic difference.\n\nYour deck isn't limited by theme or anything strategic of the sort.  Have the best paladin unit?  Use a dwarf spell on his turn to attack and do a couple points of damage!\n\nIf you're wondering where my gripes are coming from, and I will leverage my complaints about the cards being simple and lame by suggesting you look at "Card City Nights" instead of this game.  That game is short too, but the card variety, encounter variety, card pool, deck size, and strategy/mechanic/playstyles offered are a class above this game.  Card City Nights makes Northmark look like a steaming turd.\n\nAnyway, truth be told, I do not regret purchasing this game. In fact, I played it and had a good time. But I'm still not recommending it because it feels like an IOS game (which it probably is) and is sorely lacking in all departments.","December 1, 2015","false","3.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The dialogue for the most part is well presented aswell, a few spelling mistakes here and there but nothing major.\n\nThe main thing i wanted to talk about is something i feel is just casually mentioned and brushed past. That is of course the length and content of the game. my play time is not representitive of how long the game is since i am not very good, went afk, needed to retry several encounters multiple times and run around each shop looking for those cards to give me an edge.\nI think the content of the game is around 3 hours, you fight very similar battles and multiple tries help inflate the game but for pure content i think 3 hours is about right.\n\nI cant help but feel that the game had more to offer and just didnt deliver on it, like the game was pushed out the door early or just not enough care and attention was put into it. I understand its an indie title and its only £5.50 (7 if not on sale) but there are indie titles around that price that have far more content then this one has and far more replayability. By the end of it i just felt like i was missing that little bit more.\n\nwhether the game is worth the price for the content it offers is very much personal preference and you can decide that for yourself. If this game was more expensive i would not recommend it to you but it gave me a few hours of fun for just over five pounds. I dont feel ripped off, just a little disappointed.

(I got this in a $2 bundle) If you share my weakness for RPGs that use card battle systems, this is worth playing. So far (an hour in) the card system is mindless fun, but disappointingly simplistic. There is no "mana" or any other resource system in combat, nor is there any restriction on the power or type of cards that you fill your deck with. Your soldiers and the enemy's soldiers take turns going one at a time. Damage dealt is Attack minus Defence, so it's all about having everyone stack buffs on your best soldier, then having him use your best attack cards to kill the enemy. Buffs only last a few turns, and you have to mouseover their icons to check how many turns they're still in effect for. This is a needless nuisance to could have been easily fixed with a simple visual indicator.\n\nAnother nuisance is that within a town, clickable locations are only marked with a dim highlight. This immediately reminded of a bad version of Betrayal at Krondor's (yes, I'm that I'm old) town maps, except that BaK let you jump between clickable areas with the Tab key (20 years ago!) and this game doesn't. And BaK's art was much better (despite being blurry VGA).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fantadidi/recommended/307010/","fantadidi","Fantasy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fantadidi/","3018 products in account","Northmark: Hour of the Wolf is a game that involves fighting with cards.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, you have to choose bewteen different heroes (basically a warrior, a mage, a druid, ...) and a set of cards. There are some explainations so that you can learn how to battle with your cards, and it is clear enough that you should not wonder how to do.\n\nThen, the story begins, and, to me, it looks like a point-and-click game. I mean, you will realise quickly enough that, but the game is pretty easy. In fact, I am pretty sure that it is almost impossible to lose a fight except if you do your worst. You can choose whatever strategy you want (only attacks, or try to use cards to boost one of your units and attack only with this specific one), the only way you can be defeated is trying to fight an ennemy that is much stronger than you. For instance, if you battle against an opponent that is level 7 while you are still level 4, well, it might be difficult to win. Otherwise, this is really a piece of cake.\nYou will get more and more card by defeating opponents or buying them at the shops. The gold can be gathered from battles, quests and hidden stashes+chests. The best way to get gold is to complete Arena. You can find an Arena in almost each big city, and you will be rewarded with a lot of gold if you can become the master of it.\nOnce you have enough cards, you will to select only several of them to build your deck : of course, you should have the strongest ones to have a better chance to draw them.\n\nIf you do not mind an easy game, then you will play a 3-hours game that looks like a point-and-click game, but only regarding the way the story is written (the only kind of mini-game you will find is answering riddles to open chests). The plot is okay, but not very surprising : it is pretty easy to guess what is coming next and how the story ends.\nThere are some "easter eggs" that you may find pleasing, but, overall, the sense of humour that you will encounter reading the story seems a little bit out of place : to me, this kind of jokes is not at its best in this kind of story (fantasy). I would have preferred some jokes from time to time, but not that many.\n\nNevertheless, the story is well written and I think you should contemplate this game as a book/graphic novel/movie in which you are invited to be involved a little bit to use the cards, which is fine. One walkthrough is enough to unlock all of the thirteen achievements, at least if you do not miss anything. Once you have done it, you can play the game again by choosing a different hero at the beginning of the story, but I do not think that your experience of the game is going to change that much. You can also play some quick battles if you like the mechanic of the fights, but that is it.\n\nIf you can get this game in a bundle or during sales, it is fine. Otherwise, you may wait a little bit before buying it, maybe more content will be added in the months to come, as suggested by the end of the game :)","December 25, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is passable, the game is short, and if you happen to pick this up in a bundle it might very well be worth your time.

Well I experienced some errors on the final battles, which caused the whole game to crash, several times, I found this game quite addicting. I didn't mind the errors, which were trivial in the grand scope of things. Overall, I was disappointed with the errors, and some of the grammar, and some spelling was a little off. However, like I said, this game is addicting. The only true disappointment in this game is that it took a mere 10-11 hours to finish. I found myself wanting more, and hope they release a small patch for the erros, grammar, and spelling. In summary, while certain small issues were evident, the game as a whole is good. Hopefully, they'll patch the game when they release the expansion, which I hope they do.","November 19, 2014","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would definetly buy the next game that continoues the story in hope in that game they fix a couple of problems that the game have.\n\nThe BIGGEST PROBLEM this game have is the writing. It is soooo bad it kills the great story events. For example of the great story and pacing and the bad writing that kills it. At a point in game you get an item that is soo odd it just sticks to your mind that you have it but so insignificant that it is not shown anywhere on your stats and you quickly forget about it. However at a later stage where you meet a challange that looks so daunting and puts you in a mindset that there is noway this can be solved easilly they bring up that item earlier and it fits sooo  well in the development in the story that it really leaves you with a great satisfing feeling. However the very words they describe the details of this recive and give events are soo poorly picked and mixed it totally kicks you out of the immersionand you just want to delete the game in your frustration. It's like they tell you about a superbadass event about to happen and you get excited and when it comes they like text you with some lol leet words and you just feel the pain...\n\nThe characters and the visual representation on the characters are super fun and i liked them all. I cant really point out a single character (even minor plot ones) that didn't stick to me. Theire picture, and the story behind them makes them unique and fun to meet or go back to. Sadlly the wrinting is still ♥♥♥♥, maybe on a different language the game is not that bad, but the english version is dreadfull. So astheticlly the game is soo good it really helps you  feel trough the story and even if it looks low resolution the feelings and personalities come trough instnatly helping you with instant immersion in the conversation, that is killed instantly with the poor writing. However the jokes are really good and personalised wich means all jokes in the game gets an extra boost and makes you laugh beacuse they fit to the situation really well, also some jokes are set up trough huge gaps in the game and really well ties up the certain portions of the game into one whole well paced story. That is thrown off the bridge do drown by the terrible english writing...\n\nThe combat. Has a lot of different playstyles and you can perfectly bulid up your dream combo whatever it might be a full i wont be damaged style, or the I outheal and remove all ♥♥♥♥ you might throw at me style, or the I will oblibarete you in 1 turn style, or I lock down you and chip you to death style or just something I didnt come up with style. Soo many well made cool mechanics, BUT IT IS BROKEN AS ♥♥♥♥ the combat is turned based and the one goes second have NO redeaming mechanics. There is absolutelly nothing that makes up for the fact that someone goes second. And it is so broken that way that the devs literally cheating by ALWAYS make you go first. Always... So while the combat is so diversed it can be challanging or a complete stomp but beacuse you go with a cheat in an unballanced already game mechanic you will never feel you worked for your win. However when you pull off your uber combo that you bulided up so far you feel badass regardless and kinda makes you forget how wastly overpowered you are. The AI have huge holes in it where some spells causes them to focus target something else and thus making your other chaaracters invurnable since you unlikelly to be attackd there. THERE IS ONE MORE super broken part of the game. If your enemy or yourself miss a single unit out of the 3 then that means you completly miss out as much turns. Wich sounds okay that 3 can gank up on 1 but since the spells have no costs so you can spam lvl 5 spells continously with a lvl 1 unit using your hero that means you can WASTLY overpower any opponent.\nSo all and all the combat wont get in your way and it is diversed enough that you forget how ridiciluslly unballanced it is.\nOh and the chracter progression leveling system is ♥♥♥♥. just straight up crap. Absolutelly useless. Doesnt matter where you click or what oyu pick AT ALL.\n\nThe game also have a few unique features that i never seen anywhere else and they fit nicelly in the game. There are secret point and click things in the game wich gives you little treats, enough to makes you want  to search for them. There is a chest "hacking" system too that is really easy but compelling makes you feel smart a bit. Also there are secrets that is only accesible if you really try hard to get to them. Gives a good amount of variations to the game flow.","November 8, 2014","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since I played the female option--there are three male choices and one female--and all of the dialogue referred to me as "he" / "man" / etc., I am assuming that the dialogue is consistent throughout the three choices.\n\nThe story is .. not surprising. It relies heavily on tropes of the genre and gently lampoons / lightshades them; unlike some of the other reviewers, I did find the dialogue quite clever.\n\nI will also admit that when the game ended, I assumed it was moving on to another chapter of the game--this sets it up for sequels (which I will also probably play, if they come out), but left me staring at my screen, blurting out "Seriously?!"\n\nUltimately, I'd say don't buy it at full price (like I, unfortunately, did), because of its paltry length.

You pick 3 minions to do battle for you and they take turns fighting the enemy with their own powerful specialized cards or your champions weaker generic cards, your enemy then does the same to you, strategically picking off your own minions. it plays exactly like the earlier final fantasy games, just with a card game skin.

At times, it's so bad, that it's actually good. (Like a "b movie," sometimes it's exactly what you're in the mood for) It's got a lot of charm, as another reviewer mentioned. The writing is at times genuinely funny, and the story isn't bad, but there are also some amusingly bad typos, and just horrendously written passages (you may actually enjoy the awful translation, as I did). The main problem, as widely mentioned, is the lack of difficulty, so I suggest you challenge yourself by using *weaker cards* or leveling your character in a useless, handicapping way. Aside from that, the gameplay is really pretty good. It's supported by VERY strong art... I really enjoyed the art style and the interface... and very good music/sound (yes, it could've used a couple more battle tracks for sure, but what's there is very good). Not sure what else to say, it tends to get a bit better and less linear as it progresses. Looks like I got 6 hours out of it, which isn't bad. I *may* one day actually come back and play it again.\n\nI don't regret spending the $10 on it, but objectively speaking, it is slightly overpriced.
