It has an interesting art style, it has a nice mix of turn based strategy rules along with card drawing to pick your hero and warrior units. It is easy to learn and fun to play.\nI personally have not run into any bugs as of the time of writing this short review. The only down side at this point\nin the games development is that there are not any difficulty levels to pick from. I do suggest to the devs that the\ngame would benefit to have a range of easy to very difficult in order to allow all types of skill levels to enjoy what promises to be a great game. Bottom line at this time is that we have here a strategy game worth playing, but a little on the easy side at the moment. I am happy to be a part of playing this one as it grows. Thumbs up.\n","March 13","true","20.5"," 44 of 48 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","44","48","0","0"

The devs announced many major updates for the game in the future. Most  of the time that's a good thing, but I saw EA titles change so much on their way to release that it was not the same game I played in EA anymore.\n\nThis review is based on my own experience in the game how it's now on EA release date.\nI do not take future plans into account or features which did not excist yet.\n\nI'm original a board game player and changed some years (20 exactly) ago to PC gaming. I still love boardgames and I love boardgames ported to PC. As long as I play games I want them as complicated as possible. I want them to be full of content and that they all have endless replay value. There is one genre I really hate and that is casual tablet gaming.\n\nSo about the game now. I run the game on a mediocore desktop PC with a decent amount of RAM (8GB) and a 2GB AMD videocard to support my DX11 titles on Windows 10.\nThe game runs smooth. No lag in the menu. No lag in the map. I can even scroll the map without any lag while the enemy is making his moves.\n\nIf I start playing a new game I like to take the role of the annoying bughunter and always let the devs know how annoying there bugs in their newly produced game are (from my chair in front of my monitor just playing games all day lol). Not in this one. I did not find bugs. I hate it!\n\nGame start. Game plays. Game shows me a tutorial with all info I need to get into the game.\nI choose one of the two factions. And can select one till three enemy factions to play against.\nThe game generate a random skirmish map for me and I can start playing within a minute.\n\nThere are four major subjects for you to control in the game. Resource management to do what you want to do in the given turn. A hand full of cards, which depends of the faction (subfaction artillary card pack, infantary card pack or mixed card pack) which you have to draw and to play when you need them, a skirmish map where you move your units, build structures and protect your cities and the turn based tactical unit battles which you can autoplay or play yourself on a small submap.\n\nSo to like this game you must like the turn based/board game style of the game and you must like to compare the different unit skills available before you play them. You are not alone because some units are real heroes and can come in handy to support your army, city or resource management in a positive way.\n\nA major part of the game at your turn start and while in battle are RNG dice rolls. If you hate them, think they are always in advance of the AI or simply are a unlucky person forget about this game.\nIt's not that the dicerolls actually overrule the tactic part of the game but you really have to manage your changes. If you can't you are doomed.\nDice rolls are most of the time unfair. Not because the AI have any bonusses or advances (the devs approved this) but because it's human nature. If you have just two units deployed against two enemy units and you have both of them rolls a zero to attack and both of the enemy units rolls a six you loose. Simply as that.\n\nSo the tactical strategy game is the main part. The hands full of cards and the dice rolls can be your friend or enemy.\nIf you accept that there is a deep layer of a very original tactical strategy beneath the surface.\nA hidden gem.\n\nAt the moment there is nothing more in the game. I played the game more hours outside Steam so it's not tracked.\nIf you accept that it's just started EA. Accept to be part of polishing the game (in this case just to advice them about gameplay and add content because this one is for sure not in EA to let you help them find bugs) and advice the devs what to add (more content imo) and not expect a finished product I can promise that you should love the game.","March 3","true","25.9"," 53 of 66 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","53","66","3","4"

That is what is in store while playing Slitherine’s (and Auroch Digital’s) Early Access, turn-based “Last Days of Old Earth”. Action Points are the soul of the procedurally generated main map. AP are used to recruit units, move units, create armies, and to draw new hero and fighter cards for your expanding deck. Need additional resources (Materials, Population, Energy)? Leftover AP. Resources are also needed for unit purchase and for trying to improve your chances, at the turn beginnings, for Initiative dice rolls. If you win the Initiative next turn,  you not only move first, but you also earn more AP to spend.\nIt is tempting to jump in and spend all of your AP every turn. However, any unspent AP will collect each turn and eventually be spendable on more resources. More resources equals higher value cards and, again, chance for winning Initiative. Brain melting yet?\nSo, do you spend more AP building up and moving armies or hold on to them to accumulate for following turns? It’s quite the (tremendously fun) conundrum.\nAs you move through the map, there are various “Encounters” that you come across, with more decisions to be made (I won’t spoil any of them). There are also additional resources on the map itself to build collectors upon (then yet another quandary of, “Leave the collector unguarded or leave precious troops there to protect it?” Yes, you want to protect them, but at the cost of weakening an army?) and reap their benefits every turn.\nSupply is also a large factor. Your armies are penalized for moving out of supply range. The solution is to spend the much-needed resources to build outposts, to extend your supply radius.\nEverything above is before ever engaging an enemy in turn-based battles! There are easily as many strategies as game hexes within each battle itself. Setup before the battle allows you to decide which units should be frontline, and which ones are to be used as support, artillery, auxiliary, etc. Turns alternate with you choosing the order of attack you prefer. Tactics rule as you try to outwit your opponent on the battlefield, enabling you to take down an enemy with superior numbers.\nIt may verbally seem like a lot, but the game is extremely easy to get into. The AI is good as it kicked me around quite a bit, while also punishing me for any less-than-optimal decisions I may have made along the way. The game play was really smooth and I did not have any crashes or technical difficulties at all.\nFinally, all of this is available right now, in an EA game! They are going to add deck building, although the current decks are quite satisfying, which will give you and even more tailored-to-your-strategy experience. Stealth will also be added which will include sabotage and assassination They are also going to implement Air mechanics including air strikes, AA, and air recon. Single player is currently skirmishes only (with variable amounts of opponents), but they are adding a Campaign. (Multiplayer is in, but I did not test that at all).\nMy only decisions left to be made now are: 1) which side do I choose and 2) how many enemies do I want to teach me lessons about my decision-making process? I am definitely going back in to be beat upon some more.\n","March 13","true","2.5"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","37","43","0","0"

It has a great tempo--turns are fairly quick even into late game.There are small decisions (whether to spend your action points on moving a unit/card on the map or bring a new unit/card onto the map, how much resources to gamble at the start of each turn for more action points, when and where to create armies) and big decisions (when and where to build outposts to extend your supply lines and when and where to commit your army to battle). The art style and music work well to evoke a convincly bleak future-world. I am looking forward to the new content and updates. Great job by the devs--this is clearly a labor of love for them.","March 7","true","34.0"," 36 of 46 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","36","46","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/commissarbro/recommended/376450/","commissarbro","CommissarBRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/commissarbro/","1034 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is a mish-mash of a couple different genres that just works so well. You've got cards (soon deck-building), turn-based tactical battles (that is a combination of chess and HOMM) with a simplified 4x empire building system and you've got Last Days of Old Earth. It should be mentioned that this game is a "spiritual" successor to a game called Armageddon Empires (never actually played it).\nIn the game, you take control of one of two factions and by attempt to defeat the opponent using a deck of cards filled with heroes and units that you produce with three resources that are produced over turns but can be increased with collectors. Units are varied (some are support and work better in the back lane than the front lane. Arty for example) and they have special abilities. Heroes lead your armies and provide buffs depending on their 4 stats and any special abilities they have (+1 attack etc).  My explanation is terrible but the game itself is pretty simple and you'll find your self dominating your enemies rather quickly.\nGraphically, the game has a lot in common with Endless Legend and Armello. It's rather beautiful and I really enjoy this polygonal graphics trend amongst 4x and strategy games lately. Musics pretty solid as well.\nAs it stands, the game's worst issue is it can get a bit boring against the AI after about 5 games or so. Thankfully, there is multiplayer and soon there will be a Single Player Campaign to play through.\nIn summation, a solid early access title so far! Can't wait to see some new additions and the finished product.\n\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9AMEjxvl1c","March 3","true","4.2"," 33 of 45 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","33","45","6","1"

The game is an interesting mix of different genres; it is a bit of Civ and the combat reminds me of HOMM and it is also partially a card game, i really like the mix. I definitely recommend this 4X game, a 4X game with punch.","March 10","true","0.9"," 29 of 39 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","29","39","0","0"

Also, I just found out that it is based on Armageddon Empires. Well I tried Armageddon Empires demo ages ago and while I could see that it is a great game,  I just could not get into it at that time because the game was quite complicated and the manual very dense. I put it aside and intended to give it another try sometime in the future when I was ready to invest the time that was required to learn it.\n\nWell from looking over the AE manual again I can see that Last Days of Old Earth is indeed based on Armageddon Empires, but it is such an improvement, not only with its advanced graphics, but it is a great improvement in how easy it is to learn the game. The tutorial is great, the UI is great. Gameplay is of course great. I think LDoOE will be a hit because it is really something special!","March 3","true","11.6"," 29 of 41 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","29","41","0","3"

Blending the card management systems of Magic the Gathering with the thrilling combat dice rolling of Warhammer and Ogre, LDoOE is a beautiful blend of what makes the turn based genre great.\n\nPersonally I like the slower pace of the game. Meaning that unlike Starcraft I don't have to worry about getting units out as fast as possible. In LDoOE I can concentrate more on strategy and developing over time rather than spamming the same commands over and over.\n\nThe depth of this game is also wildly wonderful. Every element can be tweaked, enhanced and used to your advantage. It's clear that the developers have taken their time to fully develop each and every aspect. It is a tad daunting to start but if you enjoy the mechanics of trading card games or any turn based strategy game there is a lot to love in LDoOE.\n\nBravo those guys!","March 8","true","1.2"," 27 of 38 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","27","38","0","0"

I have seen many early access games offering less than this.\n\nWhats even more important is they are releasing what looks like a solid roadmap for the game, which looks like a strict Early Access period unlike so many other Early Access games.\n\nGameplay is very very solid and addictive, and it is reminiscent of its inspiration: Armageddon Empires.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.\n\nMy personal hopes is to get a Mutant Race and an Alien race into the game, so that it feels 100% a spiritual successor to Armageddon Empires!\n\n10/10 Team, well done!","March 4","true","8.3"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","25","35","0","0"

Without a manual or tooltips there are some things that I have no idea what they do. I really think that one thing that the game is going to need down the road to hold a player's interest is a third faction (maybe as DLC or expansion), Overall it gets a big "thumbs up" and it can be enjoyed in its current EA state.","March 4","true","3.4"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","22","31","0","0"

You move units around during a skirmish and fight some battles. There is a deck but you can't build one yourself. It seems like all the dice rolling is put in just to make it a board game but doesn't add anything to the mix. Artstyle is minimalistic but since most terain is snow everything looks a bit alike and you have to hover over each tile to see what it actually is. Currently there is only skirmish and multiplayer so for me the game got repetitive quite quickly.\n\nIt does have some interesting concepts like different units that can boost or disable oponents but it needs to evolve a bit. For now you should get it only if you're interested in bug finding.\n\n","March 8","false","1.7"," 16 of 60 people (27%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","27","16","60","2","1"
