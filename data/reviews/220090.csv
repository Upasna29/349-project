This point and click adventure, has comedy and wonderful art and puzzles as you make progress. Play as what I can only assume “Tiki” people or as they call it “Afro-Caribbean twist” and make your way around town collecting things you need to use to get farther a long the story rich campaign.\n\nPros & Cons ++  Pros\n+Appealing art style\n+Story Rich\n+Price (Current $8.99 US)\n+Fun\n+Comedy\n\n-- Cons\n-Cutscene sounds did not fit video\n-Short story - 3 hrs average\n-Some things you need to do are very random and there is no clue on what to do\n-Tedious walking\n-Must be a random clicker / Curious Explorer\n\n\nPersonal Opinion I found this game very charming and appealing. I loved the graphics and the art they decided to use and made for a much different feel to the game compared to intensely, high graphics. This was a very good game to just sit down and relax to and enjoy a good story with some great puzzles. The ending left off at a hanger which clearly shows there is going to be a 2nd chapter (There is right now). The puzzles were not to difficult though it can be quite a bit tedious running back and forth if you don’t know exactly what you need to do. Most of the time I was walking every where around town about 3 time for one thing trying to find it. I used the guide for about 3 things to help me get back on track.\n\nFinal recommendation: I really did enjoy the game play and the cutscenes did not bother me all that bad due to the shortness. Based on story, graphics, controls, art, difficulty in puzzles and the amount of things to do, I rate this game and good 8/10. This was a game that I didn’t want to walk away from. The story was great and the personalities of the characters made me feel connected. I cant wait to play the second one!\n\n\nIf you found this review helpful and want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow here!","January 14","true","3.6"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","36","39","0","4"

I came in having no expectations. I had bought the game as part of a bundle on indiegala, and was only really going to try it out while waiting for another (and much larger in size) game to download, and was frankly blown away right from the start.\n\nYou start off in dire straights with your electricity having been shut off because you hadn't paid your bills for a while. This means you can't make any money because the pump in your gas station that you own an operate relies on the power to run. However with some cheeky DYI smarts, you're soon back to normal... If normal means no customers, which... it does.\n\nLuckily as fate would have it a customer comes by, however she's not looking for a fill up, but rather a strange old book. Bwana (the main character) sees an opportunity to make a buck, and before long we're deep into the story trying to fix up an old plane to finally pay the bills, so that things can return to normality of the easy living life Bwana has been living alongside his brother at the docks.\n\nThe puzzles you come across are fairly straight forward, and no regular adventure gamer should feel challenged by this, however that's totally acceptable since it's clear that the game is really telling a good story rather than stopping you with frustrating puzzles that has you stuck for hours on end. The main character even "cheats" while doing a puzzle proclaiming he hates puzzles himself.\n\nThe game oozes with charm, and I was unable to put it down until I had finished it. It took me around 2-2½ hours to finish, but what an absolute joy it was. The animations were well done, and the voice overs were very professionally made. One of the best things about the game though I think was the music. It just heightened the experience of the game to a level it would not have been at had they not had such a talented musician in their team.\n\nPros/Cons:\n\n+ Voice overs are professional and fit the game\n+ Music has a nice vibe to them and is filled with passion\n+ Story seems interesting\n+ Graphics are well done and the animations are fluid and oftentimes funny\n+ The game just oozes charm and is hard not to like\n\n- Puzzles were oftentimes a little too easy\n\nI recommend this one to anyone wanting a nice and easy adventure game. I'm off to play the next chapter, which I hope will provide the same level of quality.","June 23, 2015","true","4.6"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","31","33","4","4"

I'm a huge fan of adventure games and just had to try it.\nLike all other adventure games, it's too short. But this is shorter than most.\nIt just doesn't feel quite finished yet. Not just due to the "Chapter One" status, but many of the events and even main characters are presented without any sort of backstory or explanation.\nThe team obviously spent a lot of time on doing animations and the graphical art is great.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/220090/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","I'll start off by saying that this isn't a bad game by any means. But... I can't recommend it.\nThe first problem is the length. This game is about 2 hours long for the average player. It costs $9. It's a point-and-click adventure with no achievements, so there's no replayability. So... yeah, it's not exactly a lot of bang for your buck.\nThe second problem is the visual design and animation, especially the latter. The backgrounds look good, they're all 2D hand-drawn kind of stuff. The character models look less good, basic 3D models with no texturing whatsoever. But the animations... are just problematic. Bad and kind of unsettling, too. The game's heavily stylzed which helps a little but not enough to make it pleasant to look at.\nThird, there's almost no plot here. Most of the major plot points that will be relevant in the second game are in the first 15 minutes and the last 5. Beyond that, there's nothing but adventure-gamey puzzles to fill in the time. You don't really even get much world development or insight into important characters - presumably in chapter 2 none of these characters will be relevant besides the few main characters, because of how this game ends.\nThe voice acting is laughably bad, and the audio quality of the voice clips varies too - a few characters used pretty awful recording equipment and you can tell. Bwana, the main character, and the chef on the Yacht are particularly bad for how stereotypical they sound, and both are pretty grating pretty fast. That's a problem when you play as the former.\nBut, no, you want to know what the real nail in the coffin is? They set up this game as having unique themes and atmosphere, and... do *nothing* with it. You explore a dock, a bit of a city, and a boat or two. Those are your locales. You perform pretty standard puzzles in all these areas. About the only thing of thematic relevance is the spice recipe section, and even then it's not that thematic overall. It's just... wasted effort to set up these themes if they're not going to be used.\nOverall, it's a pretty short and average adventure game that costs too much and does too little to stand out. I can only assume the theme and visual design is there because there'd be nothing to distinguish this game otherwise. Like I said, it's not bad, but neither is it that good.","March 28, 2015","false","2.4"," 30 of 39 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","30","39","0","0"

While there are plenty of these floating around now, and I doubt this one is anywhere close to the top(Deponia probably sits comfortably on that throne), that doesn't mean this one is bad, or not worth playing. I found it to be very amusing, well written, well voiced, and having awkward enough puzzle solutions to be worthy of its genre title. Its only real detriment is itself, and by that I mean it's too short. You won't solve very many puzzles in this game only to be surprised that it's over without much having happened in the plot. This game is only the first in a series of planned episodes, as implied by the title, but I still find myself wishing more happened in this one. I don't know the details behind its development and am not curious enough to dig them out, but I assume the creators did what they could. That said, you should enjoy what you have, support the on going development, and look forward to future episodes.\n\nI recommend this game, and will be looking forward to the rest of it.

In short, if you enjoy P&C Puzzle games, do not buy this game.\n\nIt's quite difficult to find an aspect of it I like- The puzzles were exceptionally poor, lacking in any kind of imagination or ingenuity (Think generic charity shop puzzle-book puzzles and you won't be far off). Where good Point and Click puzzle games move coherently from one puzzle to the next using logical plot points, it feels that the developers simply add arbitrary problems to form a chain of bad puzzles until it is long and bulked out enough to be called a game. This makes the game more of a chore than an enjoyable experience, as there is little in the way of progression or logic. Also, if you don't do the right action in a given time, the main character will explicitly blurt out the solution, cutting all satisfaction from the puzzle-solving experience.\nThe characters were so one-dimensional it was laughable. Worse, some characters arbitrarily changed their personalities, sometimes hating the main character for no good reason, then in the next moment being overly nice with no explanation. Further, the main character was fundamentally unlikeable (This was not helped by the emotionless mask-like faces the characters have). I also thought the voice acting wasn't up to scratch- is it just me, or does Bwana dip in and out of his accent?\nThe animation was quite poor, and at times environments looked very rushed and unfinished. The lip-sync was dreadful, and ruined any immersion the cut-scenes might provide.\nI also found the game to be completely humourless. The jokes fell so flat it was more of a cringe-worthy experience than a funny one. The only way to get through this game was to laugh at it rather than with.\n\nIt was very sad to play this game after seeing comments likening this to greats such as Grim Fandango or Monkey Island (two of my favourite games). It is a husk of a puzzle game, and was genuinely the worst P&C puzzler I have ever played.","October 11, 2014","false","2.8"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","21","29","0","0"

If character saying "There's something special about sticking a cold, wet fish in your pocket" after putting a fish into your inventory, makes you smile - then that's probably game for you.

Some are out of ordinary and make you laugh, some are usual for that type of game.

As orphans he had adopted and raised them and then soon after disappeared without a trace.\n\nThe game has some good graphics and follows your typical point and click template. I felt like the production values were on par with major companies if not exceeding in many areas.

They're running the gas charter in the bay and struggling with money. When a woman searching for a book arrives, suddenly, they're seeing "dollars".... but did they know that the book owned by their father was in their possession and sparked interest... in a powerful man?\n\nThe first chapter is set in the bay, where Bwana, your character, is working and living. As he needs to get Lyna across the ocean, he has to fix the airplane he's not flying since he was 12. That's why Bwana is messing with gas cannister, trying to get out of a freezer in a yacht, amazed that he can do a ladder with.... nah I'm not spoiling the puzzles.\n\nI enjoyed that point-&-click adventure because of the atmosphere. There is clearly influenced by Afro-Caribbean (as the characters are inspired from African masks but the way they're talking and the music is more from the Caribbean). You ask yourself if Bwana hasn't smoked weed before the beginning of the story but well, he seems more like having a cool personnality. And that, dear gamers, that what I ask also from an adventure game: characters with a grey personnality as they're reflecting what we are: imperfect. Bwana isn't stupid. Some of his remarks show someone aware of his surrounding, feeling down because of his father's disappearance. Kito, his "street" brother, is a genius when it comes to engineering, despite his cool attitude. Lyna, well-mannered, stays polite and provides information on what may happen in the background. She's never pressuring the boys, apart when the mean guys arrive. Besides, the fact that the ambiance is also leading to a comedy game is also doing that.\n\nThe graphics are also good: with scenes and rooms looking like in a comic. The only thing that I had an hard time to get used to is probably the characters design.\n\nThe music, well, is adapted. I really had the impression that I was in the Caribbean. It's awesome.\n\nApart one or two freezes, the game runs smoothly.\n\nI've just a little complaint: the puzzles aren't hard at all, true. But sometimes, it's hard to imagine the solution for some of them. Like for the propeller used as a fan by Bwana. But also, as the puzzles aren't so hard, the game is short. As short as a Hidden Object game can be. A little more of 2 hours. I understand that the rest will follow (second chapter is out). But a little more would have been good too.\n\nThe Journey Down: Chapter 1 manages to entertain me. I'll play the second chapter very soon and I'll buy that third episode without problems.","June 24, 2015","true","4.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

That said, there was at least one puzzle that refused several plausible solutions in favor of what seems to me to be a less-plausible (though more amusing) one, and several in which I knew the concept of the solution, but there wasn't much of an indication about how to actually _do_ that.  Plus the traditional complex "solve it because it's there" puzzle that turns out to massively help your protagonist progress in a somewhat illogical way, but that's so common in the genre that it might actually be considered a lack if it weren't present. :-J There is the usual complete refusal by the protagonist to clean up after themselves- I wish more of these games would let us give people their stuff _back_ once it's not needed any more.  Hopefully, there will be uses for the items still in Bwana's pockets at the end of the chapter, instead of the traditional "lost everything during the cutscene" trope.\n\nThe plot was at once engaging and somewhat frustrating- this reads more as a prologue than a first chapter to me- while there is a lot implied, I don't think any of the questions raised are actually resolved in the course of this game, which makes it feel like more of a very long demo than a short game that can stand on its own.  I have the impression that purchasers of this game will not receive Chapter Two into the bargain, which means I just paid for an interactive teaser for the longer saga.  Well played in the short term, but I don't know how long players will be okay with that tactic, whether it was intentional or not.  Personally, I will probably get the next chapter if it's not too expensive, but if there's not some resolution of at least _some_ questions, I will just wait for spoiler-full walkthroughs to get my fix of the plotline thereafter.  On the other hand, I will be looking for the rest of the story, as this has some very cool plot elements, and definitely a non-carbon-copy setting.\n\nThe plot, sadly, comes off (at least with the little you see here) as centering on a fairly standard Evil Conspiracy to keep the rich bad guy  up and the little guy down. I could be more specific, but that much you figure out pretty much in the first cutscene. If I refined it further, there would be actual spoilers involved. Given some of the references, culturally this reads to me as more Jamaican than Black African, but the character design definitely reminds me of Black African masks, nicely rendered, so maybe it's a mixture.  Either way, it's fun and attractively rendered.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this if you like the price, but be aware that you are very much getting the beginning of something, not a complete episode in a series.

If you enjoy old-school style point-and-click inventory-based adventure games, you'll enjoy this game. I was a bit unsure, but the unique setting, the charming characters, and the well designed puzzles made this a real treat. There was only one time that I needed to look online for help, and that was just a case where I thought I'd already tried what the solution to the puzzle was. And there was only one truly out there puzzle with that wacky adventure game logic. The rest were mostly sensible and intuitive, with a few light logic puzzles as well. Something else I really liked about this game is that some items are reused in multiple puzzles, rather than everything being one-and-done. Things that would be considered useful tools are in fact, useful in many situations. Outside of that, the art style and music are both fantastic as well. Be advised, it does end on a cliffhanger, and you'll certainly want to proceed immediately to Chapter Two, which is even better than the first chapter.","January 9","true","8.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

This is really what got my my attention. The humor is moderate, couple of laughs here and there, but it gets a bit exagerated at time. Cool in over all. The puzzle are simple and positiverly silly at best but if you just play for entertainment, not taking it too seriously (it's not Myst), you'll have a good time.\n\nNegative side:\nOk, this is the only negative thing I have to say about chapter one. It was way, WAY, too short. You could probably finish the game in less than 15 min. I just started to warm up and really enjoy the game when the end credits just popped up. Shocking! I just couldn't believe it, I thought it was a prank.. but no, that was it, right to my face! That really killed all the appreciation I had for the concept.\n\nThe fact is that the chapter one is nothing more than a teaser to get you to buy chapter 2. I bought both anyway simultaniously, but I do not appreciate such manipulation from story tellers, it really left me with a bitter after taste.\n\nI haven't played chapter 2 yet, and I am not as enthusiastic as before to start it, as it might be just another teaser... Eventhough I got both of them on sales I still feel like I got a bit ripped of, at least for chapter one. For such a short story it's not even worth 1€. The developers offer a free (low res) version of Ch1 from their site, i'd probably recommend that one instead.

It has a great art style and I like the Jamaican Accent of the protagonist, I don't think I heard that in a (adventure) game before so it was refreshing and enjoyable. Some of the other voice actors are a little weak though. The Puzzles aren't all that hard but I really don't mind that, in fact I prefer it to a degree as long it's not as stupidly easy as Broken Age was. There's plenty humor and it doesn't stand out above the classics, but it's still enough to be entertained and appreciate it. I did laugh a few times, my favorites were the Crane scene, the Pelikan scene and the Concierge! Of course being episodic there is unfortunately no real closure and it is rather short, so it might not be for everyone except for those of us starved for more adventures and it fulfilled that job for me.

I usually don't look for difficulty in point-and-click adventure games, since I found story to be the most important thing to consider, but these puzzles are beyond any measurement of difficulty. I mean, Broken Age for example, also had pretty easy puzzles, but they made sense, progressed the story in one way or another, and they required some kind of thinking nonetheless. In The Journey Down, puzzles are like "There's a thirsty guy over here, there's a glass over there, and there's a water tap right there. Now you click them in order.", and they have no contribution to story whatsoever. By the way, you are a reggie guy who speaks five times slower than an avarage person, reviewing literally each and every action you do. Game consistently tries to be funny, especially with accents, but they are flat-out boring, with nothing happening outside. And that's about it.\n\nAlthough it's not the worst point-and-click adventure game ever, there are so many amazing point-and-click games to be played like Monkey Island series, The Longest Journey series, Syberia series, Discworld, Full Thortle, Broken Sword series, and Broken Age, that The Journey Down is not even a competitor.\n\nOne last thing, if you can compare this game with Grim Fandango, you are clearly out of your mind.","November 26, 2014","false","4.2"," 25 of 46 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","25","46","0","1"

If you like the setting or classic style point ‘n’ clicks, then it’ll be right up your alley.\n\nLong version:The Journey Down as a point ‘n’ click adventure is as old-school as it can get; this also means that the difficulty only depends on how experienced you are with adventure game logic. If you cannot figure out how to use a piece of cheese to get a ceiling fan, then it will be hard to progress. If you have seen more insane things, then the game will mostly be a quick two-hour story.\n\nBut what a story! Sure, you cannot explore many places, but as it was shown us by companies like TellTale long ago, great and funny games can be made even with one location. Not to mention that the Caribbean/African/Rastafari mixture of themes and the matching accents create a good atmosphere, the characters are almost offensively stereotypical but funny and interesting, the dialogues are witty and well-written, and the miniature plot is exciting enough to make anyone want to play the second part as soon as possible. Overall it’s an enjoyable, but short first chapter of a promising miniseries.","January 30, 2015","true","2.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Lately, I have been playing loads of horror and FPS games like TF2, NMRiH, Half Life 2, EP1 and EP2 etc.. And, To be honest, I was getting tired of playing them. But when I played this game, It Re-Indulged me into the world of gaming, As in this game, You don't have to go along and start killing people/NPCs for no apparent reason. It gave me a good break from all the shooting and made me start to think on how to complete levels, Rather than thinking about how much Life or Ammo I have left. The story is great as well, With alot of suspense, Which makes it even better. I'm just glad I found out about this game right  after  the release of Chapter 2, Or I would have been left in the suspense like everybody else who bought the game as soon as it was released.\nSo Overall, This is a really good game and I highly recommend it to any puzzle lover or a person who has been playing too much FPS lately...","October 12, 2014","true","4.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Unfortunately, that's the most positive thing I have to say about this game.  It doesn't deliver on the promised laughs and brain teasing.  The puzzles aren't challenging, but sometimes involve re-searching something that didn't yield anything useful when you first tried it, which is annoying in a point-and-click.  The humor comes entirely from playing up the ethnicity - which really isn't very funny - and the idiocy of the puzzle solutions - which is standard fare in a point-and-click, and the execution here is not noteworthy.  Most of the voice acting is done decently well, but one character in particular sounds a bit like a deteriorated cassette recording, and hearing every other sentence punctuated with 'man' gets old.\n\nNow, usually, a point-and-click's saving grace is its story, and I'd like to be able to recommend this one on that basis, but I can't.  It's not that it's bad; it's just that there's not nearly enough of it to render judgment.  The game's only about 2 hours long, and most of that is not spent developing the story.  All that you're getting here is a hook for a story, and it's one that could be good, but isn't especially compelling.  This doesn't feel like chapter 1 of a story so much as a prologue, or maybe a demo for the full game.\n\nGranted, the price isn't too steep, and it could be worth getting on sale, but if you're looking for point-and-clicks, I suggest you try Daedalic first.","December 31, 2014","false","2.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Unlike many 'modern' titles offering a lot of meaningless wandering and clicking, this one actually tells a story and does it well while at the same time keeping on a fine edge between being overly easy and stupidly hard and counter intuitive.\nAnd let me tell you, I got that noir-ish feeling as soon as I started the game - and it's there alright. It's very similar in atmosphere to noir movies, and, actually, leans a bit towards Grim Fandango (the game). The art style, the music, the humor, the characters and backgrounds all blend together marvelously and produce quite the unique atmosphere and thus the unique game.\nChapter Two is already out and I can't wait to see it, since Chapter One actually ends with a cliffhanger a few miles high (and I tell you can take it quite literally too).\n\nDo I recommend it? For those who appreciate a good noir movie with a pinch of healthy humor it'll score about 10 out of 10. For others probably around 7 or 8, it depends.","May 6, 2015","true","3.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

The world-building is not quite as unique as Grim Fandango, but it comes close. There's definitely a Double Fine or late-period LucasArts vibe to the game, which really appeals to me. I'm invested enough in the story to consider buying Chapter 2 at full price.\n\nThe Bad: The gameplay is as simplified as point-and-click gets. No SCUMM parsers or clue-matching or The Cave-style special abilities. While this makes it ideal for relative newcomers to the genre, veteran players may find it derivative. Most puzzles feel like variations on time-tested scenarios: getting past the hostile guard animal, tricking the snooty doorman, collecting MacGuffin parts (in this case, restoring a plane).\n\nThe Ugly: Believe me, I prefer shorter games, but the play time for this felt kinda ridiculous, at just under the 4-hour mark.

The gameplay was really good from a point and click viewpoint with the puzzles being rather intuitive and I only had to check a guide a few times. The graphics are nice, however, how the characters looked while on the setting bothered me as they looked like they weren't part of it at times.

The game's artstyle is appealing and all the backgrounds and characters are well done, but thats about all the praise this game will get. The story itself is bland and the delivery is atrocious, the "puzzles" are so easy and unchallenging a monkey could probably do it. Additionally some of the characters  are extremely annoying as they try to play it off as funny (I am not even sure if this game has a target audience based on its subject matter). Now given the above I'd almost be willing to count this as a good feature, the game is also insanely short, you can clear it in literally a couple hours. I do not recommend this game to anyone, there are good point and click adventures out there that offer challenge or a good story, this has neither of the two essential elements.","November 8, 2014","false","3.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

One day a mysterious woman by the name of Lina comes into the gas station looking for a book. Bwana finds the book and Lina is pleased. We find out the book is about a Place named the Edge and Lina wants to go there. So its up to Bwana to take her there.So how is this game ? Well its a simple point and click game and its great. Graphiclly the art is really good and has a great atmoshpere and the soundtrack is amazing jazz music and it really adds for the atmosphere.The puzzles are pretty simple for the most part and some of them are pretty well thought out. Some of them are quite abnoxious. Overall its a great omage to the old Point and click games and its definatly a good time and i cant wait to see where does the story go after chapter one.

I'm absolutely stunned.\nThe puzzels are very logical, no stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t combinations, maybe sometimes even a little bit to obvious, could be a little trickier sometimes. And just as it ought to be there are plenty of hidden hints in the dialogs. Perfect!\nThe story is the perfect combination of thrilling adventures with enough hilarious dialogs to ease up the excitement so it never gets too tense. Bwana, is cool with any situation.\nThe dialogs are brilliant and the voices of the characters are a true pleasure to listen to, especially of course Bwana and Kito.\nThe whole adventure is supported by an awesome chilling and thrilling soundtrack.\nAll together a true masterpiece. My new favourite adventure.\n\nThe first part is a little bit short but honestly, time flys when playing such a great adventure. The second part is of perfect length to my taste.","November 10, 2015","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

You usually have a given task to do, and you have to go around collecting seemingly unrelated items and using them to solve various puzzles to progress through the game. TJD uses "adventure game logic", which means that you can't use a mop to shoo away a pesky pelican, but you can stuff a fish with chilli peppers and then get the pelican to eat the fish, causing it to faint (from the spiciness). You see where I'm going with this? There is nothing wrong with that, however. It's a fun genre trope that brings me back to the days of the classic Monkey Island games.\n\nI'm not gonna talk much about the story, there are some interesting things here and there, but really it's the characters that make this game shine. Every character in the game has their own "thing" going on, making them amusing, though slightly 1 dimensional at times. The main charcter, Bwana, stands out as a very likeable guy that is very genuine and good-natured.

Took me 2-3 hours to finish this chapter, probably due to how easy the puzzles were.\n\nStill, I highly recommend this game if you wanna have a fun afternoon playing an honest point&click adventure game.

On its' kickstarter page (for episode 3) it spouts that it's on the same level as classics like Grim Fandango and the Monkey Island series. And, it's actually RIGHT! This game is everything you want from a classic point-and-click adventure game. It has the charm, the comedy, the well written and planned puzzles, and it even pokes some fun at some game cliches of the genre. The characters are very memorable, and the voice actors are absolutely perfect. I never thought I'd find a great point-and-click adventure game like this again, but the team at SkyGoblin have shown us that these games can totally still be made and that they aren't solely a product of their time.\n\nFOR THOSE OF YOU WITH LOW END COPUTERS - BUY THIS GAME\n\nI have a laptop with an OKAY graphics card, nothing special. But I also have a desktop computer with a graphics card that can only run basically counter-strike 1.6 or gameboy advance roms (I don't support downloading games illegally or games that you don't already own). The reason I bring this up is because The Journey Down: Chapter One plays better on my desktop computer (which basically has no graphics card) than any other game I've ever played on it before. This game runs incredibly smoothly. Sometimes there's some studdering in the walk animation but I assume that's just the game engine and not a fault of computer hardware, but nothing is game-breaking. I'm extremely happy with my purchase and I wish more games were designed with a wider range of hardware in mind so that they are capable of running as well as The Journey Down does on all my devices. Seriously, keep your eye on SkyGoblin for future games, and support them on Kickstarter (currently episode 3 is on kickstarter as I type this) if you enjoy point-and-click adventures.\n\nTLDR:\n\nDo you like Lucasarts games, point-and-click adventures, or well written stories and characters? Then you should purchase this game. You won't have any technical problems, you'll just have a smooth ride into the awesome southern African influenced gameplay and story that is The Journey Down.\n\nCheers.","October 4, 2015","true","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

On its' kickstarter page (for episode 3) it spouts that it's on the same level as classics like Grim Fandango and the Monkey Island series. And, it's actually RIGHT! This game is everything you want from a classic point-and-click adventure game. It has the charm, the comedy, the well written and planned puzzles, and it even pokes some fun at some game cliches of the genre. The characters are very memorable, and the voice actors are absolutely perfect. I never thought I'd find a great point-and-click adventure game like this again, but the team at SkyGoblin have shown us that these games can totally still be made and that they aren't solely a product of their time.\n\nFOR THOSE OF YOU WITH LOW END COPUTERS - BUY THIS GAME\n\nI have a laptop with an OKAY graphics card, nothing special. But I also have a desktop computer with a graphics card that can only run basically counter-strike 1.6 or gameboy advance roms (I don't support downloading games illegally or games that you don't already own). The reason I bring this up is because The Journey Down: Chapter One plays better on my desktop computer (which basically has no graphics card) than any other game I've ever played on it before. This game runs incredibly smoothly. Sometimes there's some studdering in the walk animation but I assume that's just the game engine and not a fault of computer hardware, but nothing is game-breaking. I'm extremely happy with my purchase and I wish more games were designed with a wider range of hardware in mind so that they are capable of running as well as The Journey Down does on all my devices. Seriously, keep your eye on SkyGoblin for future games, and support them on Kickstarter (currently episode 3 is on kickstarter as I type this) if you enjoy point-and-click adventures.\n\nTLDR:\n\nDo you like Lucasarts games, point-and-click adventures, or well written stories and characters? Then you should purchase this game. You won't have any technical problems, you'll just have a smooth ride into the awesome southern African influenced gameplay and story that is The Journey Down.\n\nCheers.","October 4, 2015","true","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

With a mysterious plot, silly humour, inventory puzzles and exotic locations, it’s no wonder that comparisons to the classics have been made. However, for me there just wasn’t enough story for two-and-a-half hours of gameplay and it felt more like an extended prologue rather than the first episode in an adventure.\n\nThe second episode is available on Steam now and the third is now being worked on, after a successful Kickstarter campaign saw the developer raise 136% of their intended target. I’m not in any immediate rush to make a further purchase but perhaps at some point in the future Chapter Two will also be added to my wishlist.\n\nFull details on The Journey Down can be found here:\nhttp://1001up.com/2016/01/18/preview-the-journey-down/","January 18","false","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The biggest con is that it's excessively short - I'd apparently finished it in less than two hours, stuck on a single puzzle which basically involved using a random item on a random item without any in-game clue. I HAD played it once before, but retained almost no memories of the gameplay - though even with that, I doubt it would've taken me much more than 2 hours overall. Just about every other puzzle in the game is at least vaguely logical if you paid attention and checked everything before, which is definitely a plus. Graphically from great to... hm... and mostly quite stylish, some chuckles here and there... Great soundtrack, good voice-acting (though one character, for some reason, sounds like he's talking through a 2$ microphone, really strange). The lack of body would have me consider a non-recommendation, despite all the obvious positive sides, but together with the excellent Chapter Two, it's a thumbs-up.","April 21","true","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It reminds me about everything that makes point-and-click adventures one of my long-term favorite genres, without any of the annoyances that plagued it along the years.\n\nThe first chapter offers approximately 2 1/2 hours of entertainment, including a few nicely produced cut-scenes, dialogues and gameplay, and is clearly meant to be followed by the second and upcoming third chapters. In many ways this has all the winning characteristics of a good Monkey Island, especially the humor and overall positively carefree vibe, with all the piratey bits replaced by African-inspired culture set in a more modern setting.

Not because I dislike it in particular but because I don't see it staying interesting. I'm rather picky when it comes to point and clicks and like them to be very weird and cerebral. For example I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream, Kentucky Route Zero and even Myst.\n\nEven though this has a really neat aesthetic including the African masks and great characters (the two main guys remind me of the Jamaican bobsled team, and that's awesome) it's just not bizarre enough for my standards of point and clicks to devote two more chapters of time to it. I just don't think I can give it the attention it deserves. At the end of this I was just reading the subtitles and skipping voiced dialog. Which I feel like an ♥♥♥ for doing because the VAs are great.\n\nBasically if you like point and clicks with a passion you'll probably like this. The puzzles are just as silly and rewarding to complete as ever.

I've seen it as low as sixty nine cents, sure, but even at twelve bucks for this and its sequel it's a heck of a value. Charming, pretty easy, and short.\n\nBut it does have a heavy dose of adventure game logic. The fact that the game goes to great lengths to poke fun at adventure game logic("I hate puzzles!" exclaims the main character) does nothing to ameliorate the fact that it relies on some goofy leaps of logic. That said, it's otherwise well written, well performed, and beautifully scored. The aesthetic is especially interesting, raster backgrounds digitally painted over free hand sketches with characters rendered in a heavily subdived prerendered 15FPS 3D meant to imply stop motion animation. However, it often falls short of this ambition and just looks like early CG. But when it works it's actually extremely lovely.\n\nObviously, if you really want stop motion animation in your point and click adventure game, go grab Dream Machine. The Journey Down is a unique voice in games. I found its characters goofily endearing, and enjoyed my time with them.","November 22, 2014","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game's content is very similar to Grim Fandango.  While the graphics are cartoonish and flamboyant, the humor and overall vibe is directed towards an adult audience.  The gameplay is not like Grim Fandango, but rather the style of the old school Monkey Island series.  Manipulating inventory is easy, as you just drag an item over to another item, whether it be on the screen or in the inventory.  There aren't any complex inventory combinations, and the puzzles are very intuitive.  The one thing that bothered me about the game is they sometimes drop hints when you are attempting to solve a puzzle.  This might be nice for games where the puzzles are less intuitive, but the puzzles in this game really aren't that hard to begin with.  The other problem I had with the game is how short it is.  I solved the entire game in two hours, which includes me leaving the game open while I made a sandwich.  I thought to myself "Oh.  It looks like I got about a third of the game done by now!" only to realize at that point, the entire game is only one chapter...  Oh well.

This game was reccommended to me by a friend a while back -- I saw that it was 90% off during the Summer Sale (for $0.69) and decided to give it a try. The game is well-exectued, and delivers about what you would expect from a casual point-and-click adventure. The story is entertaining and straightforward, and the puzzles are well-placed and logical (even somewhat challenging, at points); the story is well-paced, and can be finished in under 2.5 hours. What stood out most about this title was the unique art style, consisting of 3d rendered characters on a 2d hand-drawn background. As a long-time gamer who has rarely seen this concept executed, I was rather impressed by the general mood and depth these environments were able to confer to the overall experience. With that said, this game is not for everyone, and especially not for those gamers that demand a constantly active and physically engaging experience. However, if you have fond memories of a time when point-and-click games were genuinely appreciated, especially titles like Grim Fandango, The Neverhood, The Secret of Monkey Island, etc., do yourself a favor and check this game out.","July 2, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/220090/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","In the Journey Down, by SkyGoblin, you will take on the roll of Bwana, a pilot who is scared of heights, and who runs a fuel station on the outskirts of the town St. Armando. He lives with his best friend Kito. It doesn't take long for something mysterious to happen as a professor's assistant shows up looking for an old book. This is where the adventure really starts to begin, and its going to be up to you to escape and save everyone.\n\nGraphically I can definitely feel the African tribal theme showing up in all the character designs. All faces seemed to be modeled after tribal masks, and definitely add something extra to the personalities of the characters that you will encounter. There's also the different area designs, you will of course spend the vast majority of your time around the fuel station, but you will also get to see a cafe, a yacht, and a railway stop. All of these areas have this painted feel to them, but in a crisp way that draws the player into the scenes. As this is a point click and adventure, you will notice that sometimes the items you get to interact with are very obviously placed, and other times you will have to pay attention to your surrounds to find what might be hiding behind a door, on a bookshelf, and a wall, and more.\n\nThe music and the voice acting in the game kind of gives me a Rastafarian vibe, with a little twist of African tribal feel. I do think that there are some characters that might be laying it on a bit thick, but for the most part all the voices fit their parts for the game.\n\nThe controls in the game are as you might imagine them to do, you are going to move your mouse around the screen, seeing what or who you can interact with, and you are going to click to interact with whatever is currently selected.\n\nThis was one of those games that seemed interesting, and that I just had to at least try out, and I'm glad I did. Though the theme and feel of the game was a bit different than I have played, the storyline was definitely something that the further I got in, the more I wanted to know more. That being said there was quite a bit of distraction, as point and clicks usually cause, so that you had to do some puzzle solving, or item combining to complete a goal, or get past an obstacle. I was impressed with the amount of completely different characters you had to deal with, and some of the puzzles that I had to take on. There are some put this here and that will solve the problem puzzles, and there's also those puzzles that you will have to find the solution elsewhere to solve. Now this is only the first chapter, and I have to say that after playing this, and recording the playthrough for it, I am dying to get my hands on chapter 2. Thankfully that chapter is already out, I just hope that SkyGoblin can keep them coming.\n\nSo if you are looking for a point and click adventure featuring a cast of characters that sort of fit the mold, and at the same time don't, you might want to check out this game. What I mean by that is that even though you are playing the part of the reluctant hero, this hero is probably a little different than you are used to, be it in the humor of the game, the appearance, or just the way that he interacts. This is definitely a game to at least try out, I know that there's a low-res free version of first chapter, but I would recommend throwing down the money to get the high-res, it looks really good. So with that I'm going to give this first chapter (which is about 2 hours long) a 9.0 out of 10.","October 9, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The characters are likable and the story is intriguing. It suffers from the typical adventure game annoyance of very slow character movement, but the areas aren't very big, so it's forgiveable. I only got stuck twice, so it's not terribly difficult, but the puzzles all actually make sense. If you think logically, you should be able to manage everything.\n\nThe most difficult part is simply finding all the locations. Several of them are not obvious at first, and I spent a lot of time wandering around completey lost as to how to progress until I finally peeked at a walkthrough and saw something like "go to the area behind the charter." There were at least three areas I didn't find on my own. So if you get stuck, make sure you've visited everywhere you can reach on the map before worrying that you can't solve the puzzle.\n\nI enjoyed this game, and I'm looking forward to chapter two.","June 20, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After a series of major disappointments with point & click adventures in the past few years, it feels truly refreshing to find a game with as much soul as The Journey Down. The characters are memorable and relatable, the locations are nice and captivating and the game feels "just right". It feels and plays largely like a child of the Monkey Island series and Grim Fandango.\n\nOn a more technical side, I wish the game supported native 1080p without streching the graphical assets. Gameplay and puzzle-wise, most puzzles are pretty logical and easy to solve. You will rarely have to try the "combine everything with everything" approach, that, sadly enough, seems to be extremely prevalent in the genre. Kudos to the devs on that one.\n\nHighly recommended.","October 11, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Think of it this way: the world and the characters do let your imagination think more than what the story and the dialogues will actually do. That said, it's filled with humor and non-sense and puzzles resemble this attitude in a way that most of the time will make things harder, not because you're going through an hard-to-solve puzzle but just because the solution is totally non sense! To be fair, there's a bit of a path, but solving some puzzles will require you to look for the "hidden object" around" or do the last thing you'd think of.\n\nOverall the game is fun. But basically there's just a few places you can walk through, and you'll have to go through each one over and over and over again. Really, it's not just about backtracking, it's just that it feels physically cramped to some point Regarding the interaction, you have a decent amount of things you can interact with, but a lot of em will simply be plane objects with no use for either the story or the gameplay.\n\nWhat saves this game in the end is how the hand drawn visuals work with the audio part, to make an atmosphere where the humor can play its own part: it's a fairly decent game you can relax with, chill while listening to the soundtrack and solving these wierd puzzles.","August 26, 2014","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story seems good too, but it's a little hard to judge, seeing as this is only the first chapter. What I do know is that several of the characters have already endeared themselves to me. Bwana himself, Mama Makena, and Makote, even the Dockmaster, who only has a couple of lines. I'm usually wary of episodic games, never knowing how much you'll have to pay in the end to get a complete story, or if you'll EVER get the whole story (I'm looking at you Insecticide *sob*), but I'm going to shell out the 8 Euro for chapter two right now.

Most because of the really long dealogues. It is not the easiest game, sometimes you will be running around the places and doing 10 times the same thing until you will realise you need something else, it doesn't really have continuesly going moves or so, you can go to do many things at once. It was pretty easy to lost in the first minutes of gameplay.\n\nGraphics are really nice, the one thing wich distracted me were the faces of the characters, I think it could have been made just real life looking, but that is just my personal opinion.\n\nSoundrack music is alright, in every different place it will be other, which is really good. Character's voices are nicely done. The one thing you can really notice is that some of them voice is not that much clear.\n\nI don't know how long is this game, but I been playing 2 hours (I am not the fan of this type of games) and as far as I have done is put engines in the plane.\n\nMy verdict is that if you like such type games I really think you will find this to be awesome game, but in my case I don't feel like I will be playing it any more.\n","October 21, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Think of it this way: the world and the characters do let your imagination think more than what the story and the dialogues will actually do. That said, it's filled with humor and non-sense and puzzles resemble this attitude in a way that most of the time will make things harder, not because you're going through an hard-to-solve puzzle but just because the solution is totally non sense! To be fair, there's a bit of a path, but solving some puzzles will require you to look for the "hidden object" around" or do the last thing you'd think of.\n\nOverall the game is fun. But basically there's just a few places you can walk through, and you'll have to go through each one over and over and over again. Really, it's not just about backtracking, it's just that it feels physically cramped to some point Regarding the interaction, you have a decent amount of things you can interact with, but a lot of em will simply be plane objects with no use for either the story or the gameplay.\n\nWhat saves this game in the end is how the hand drawn visuals work with the audio part, to make an atmosphere where the humor can play its own part: it's a fairly decent game you can relax with, chill while listening to the soundtrack and solving these wierd puzzles.","August 26, 2014","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a point-and-click adventure starring a cast of characters modeled after tribal masks (haven't come across any from Scratches yet, so we should be safe). You play Bwana, and your goal is to get your airplane running so you can make some money to pay the power bill. The chapter's pretty short; I finished it in about three hours. But it's filled with some beautiful art intermingled with some 3D models, as well as probably my favorite element of the game: the *excellent* reggae soundtrack. Voicework is adequate. It's clearly performed by the creators' friends and volunteers, leading to a couple voices that don't completely fit, or a few that sound as though they had some poorer quality mics. None of them are so bad as to spoil my enjoyment of the game, however. The mood is lighthearted and humorous, and the characters are generally lovable. Puzzle solutions mostly make sense, and the behind-the-scenes shots unlocked after finishing the chapter are actually pretty interesting, too. I'll be looking forward to Chapter Two.","January 21, 2013","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

The storyline has some sparse similarities to GF, but is original in its own right and I loved the Afro-Caribbean flair; coupled with the graphics, which were kind of a cartoonish noir, and it was really enjoyable. I thought the dialogue was a little tacky at points, but that really didn't detract from the humor or the overall quality of the game. A bit more difficult than I expected it to be, which was a pleasant surprise; it mixes traditional puzzle-solving with the usual point-and-click puzzles, which was pretty refreshing. It's a bit on the short side, but hey, it's only the first chapter--and seven bucks is a fair price.\n\nWhen you beat the chapter, some bonus behind-the-scenes material is revealed, which I personally loved because I like seeing the creative process for games. Planning on playing chapter two when my next paycheck comes in, and I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants a light, fun point-and-click experience.","September 26, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I find the character concepts very neat, too, and the storyline intriguing so far, though it's barely mentioned (just in this chapter, hopefully) to be honest. Definitely worth picking up, especially on sale. Looking forward to the next chapter.","February 16, 2013","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Picked up during the steam summer sale for pennies\n\nThe Good:\n* Backdrops are charming and well designed\n* Distinctive characters\n* Music and voice acting are good quality\n* Story is both in turns intriguing and mundane\n\nThe Bad:\n* Puzzles are simple, boring and sloppy at times\n* Animations are rather clunky looking and ruin the charm\n* Found the characters voices distractingly OTT\n* Script drags and becomes laboured and you just skip it\n* Lip-sync is often off\n* Very short\n\nImpressions: Was impressed by the initial visuals but rapidly lost interest in the awkward animation, irritating voice acting and rather poor puzzles (one I knew how to solve wouldn't let me until I re-clicked a clue I'd already clicked earlier). Early puzzles are extremely simple.. bordering on not being puzzles at all which I took to mean this was more like an interactive story rather than an adventure. For the sake of more steps or complexity it could have saved the game.\n\n\nConclusion. I can't condemn a game I didn't enjoy when I know  my irritation at the Caribbean overtones that are turns off's for me will not bother others. As others have noted it was 4 years between chapter 1 & 2 in a proposed series of 4 games.\n\n5/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/220090/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","In the Journey Down, by SkyGoblin, you will take on the roll of Bwana, a pilot who is scared of heights, and who runs a fuel station on the outskirts of the town St. Armando. He lives with his best friend Kito. It doesn't take long for something mysterious to happen as a professor's assistant shows up looking for an old book. This is where the adventure really starts to begin, and its going to be up to you to escape and save everyone.\n\nGraphically I can definitely feel the African tribal theme showing up in all the character designs. All faces seemed to be modeled after tribal masks, and definitely add something extra to the personalities of the characters that you will encounter. There's also the different area designs, you will of course spend the vast majority of your time around the fuel station, but you will also get to see a cafe, a yacht, and a railway stop. All of these areas have this painted feel to them, but in a crisp way that draws the player into the scenes. As this is a point click and adventure, you will notice that sometimes the items you get to interact with are very obviously placed, and other times you will have to pay attention to your surrounds to find what might be hiding behind a door, on a bookshelf, and a wall, and more.\n\nThe music and the voice acting in the game kind of gives me a Rastafarian vibe, with a little twist of African tribal feel. I do think that there are some characters that might be laying it on a bit thick, but for the most part all the voices fit their parts for the game.\n\nThe controls in the game are as you might imagine them to do, you are going to move your mouse around the screen, seeing what or who you can interact with, and you are going to click to interact with whatever is currently selected.\n\nThis was one of those games that seemed interesting, and that I just had to at least try out, and I'm glad I did. Though the theme and feel of the game was a bit different than I have played, the storyline was definitely something that the further I got in, the more I wanted to know more. That being said there was quite a bit of distraction, as point and clicks usually cause, so that you had to do some puzzle solving, or item combining to complete a goal, or get past an obstacle. I was impressed with the amount of completely different characters you had to deal with, and some of the puzzles that I had to take on. There are some put this here and that will solve the problem puzzles, and there's also those puzzles that you will have to find the solution elsewhere to solve. Now this is only the first chapter, and I have to say that after playing this, and recording the playthrough for it, I am dying to get my hands on chapter 2. Thankfully that chapter is already out, I just hope that SkyGoblin can keep them coming.\n\nSo if you are looking for a point and click adventure featuring a cast of characters that sort of fit the mold, and at the same time don't, you might want to check out this game. What I mean by that is that even though you are playing the part of the reluctant hero, this hero is probably a little different than you are used to, be it in the humor of the game, the appearance, or just the way that he interacts. This is definitely a game to at least try out, I know that there's a low-res free version of first chapter, but I would recommend throwing down the money to get the high-res, it looks really good. So with that I'm going to give this first chapter (which is about 2 hours long) a 9.0 out of 10.","October 9, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The storyline has some sparse similarities to GF, but is original in its own right and I loved the Afro-Caribbean flair; coupled with the graphics, which were kind of a cartoonish noir, and it was really enjoyable. I thought the dialogue was a little tacky at points, but that really didn't detract from the humor or the overall quality of the game. A bit more difficult than I expected it to be, which was a pleasant surprise; it mixes traditional puzzle-solving with the usual point-and-click puzzles, which was pretty refreshing. It's a bit on the short side, but hey, it's only the first chapter--and seven bucks is a fair price.\n\nWhen you beat the chapter, some bonus behind-the-scenes material is revealed, which I personally loved because I like seeing the creative process for games. Planning on playing chapter two when my next paycheck comes in, and I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants a light, fun point-and-click experience.","September 26, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The characters may look weird, but it's easy to get used to the style and it looks and sounds very nice overall. I just wish the characters had more varied lines when talked to multiple times. I also missed the ability to "just look at objects" to get funny comments on them like in other adventure games, but for objects you can't take or interact with, you still get them, so it's ok.\nOverall, a good game.\n\nFrom a GNU/Linux compatibility point of view, the game runs perfectly. The only bug I encountered is that the game crashes when switching from fullscreen to windowed mode. But since it starts by default in fullscreen mode and switching from fullscreen to windowed works, it wasn't an issue.\nTested on Kubuntu 13.10 with an Intel HD graphics 4000 card.\n\nLooking forward to episode 2. :)\n","January 4, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very reminiscent of Grim Fandango.  The game's first chapter is a solid couple of hours with some good puzzles, and even though the game is fairly linear, you might get stuck a few times trying to find some obscure item hidden in the background.  There's only one or two examples of what I'd call "pixel hunting" in this game, and one of them is fairly apparent in the Giant Bomb Quick Look of this title.\n\nI don't know if I'd say the game is as funny as the best games of the genre, but it's pan-African-Jamaican style is certainly quite charming.  The world feels very lived in, even though it's only the first chapter of an episodic series.  My main reason for comparing it to Grim Fandango is that there is clearly a larger universe being set up, one far beyond the gas station where you start the game.  The game isn't called "The Journey Down" for no reason.\n\nI'll let you know now: you can't make the character walk any faster, but it's not really a problem because there are only a few main locations for your character Bwana to go.","February 19, 2013","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The character design was good and the level was beautifully designed. The music fit in to the game and contributed to the overall atmosphere. There were many puzzles. Most of them challenging enough. I would like to see more of them in the next episode though and maybe some more difficult ones and not just item based missions.\nThe characters were cool but the dialouge could be shorter. I ended up clicking my wat through most of it. But nontheless it was a very entertaining game and I hope to see more in the next episode!","January 3","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While I haven't started chapter two yet, I can tell you that chapter one has a LOT of great things going for it:\n\n- The first thing you'll notice is the music. It's a great soundtrack that fits very well into the atmosphere of the narrative.\n- The atmosphere is absolutely enchanting. It is a good example of what an awesome "feel" for a game can be and at the same time disappointing because you don't get to experience the city itself. The characters are interesting and they also fit really well into the theme and style.\n- Easy interface. It's an old school point and click adventure so there is minimal hud and it just has what it needs.\n\n-One major gripe I have is a lot of the acting. The sailors in particular are especially bad and while it serves its purpose, it's just a testament to how great everything else is and how surprisingly bad some of the acting can be. The main characters do fine, though, so it shouldn't be a deal breaker if you love good adventure games.\n\n-The puzzles themselves are great and I they never felt too difficult. I never had to consult a walkthrough so maybe I got lucky because as much as I love the old point and click adventures, they made me feel pretty stupid after finding out how to complete an obscure puzzle. Luckily this didn't give me that feeling and even if you do need a walkthrough, you'll probably facepalm yourself wondering why you didn't think of that instead of, "How was I supposed to figure that out?!"\n\n-I got through the game in a relatively short time and while I enjoyed every bit of it, I did wish it was a bit longer. Like, I said, the atmosphere was great so I could've spent a lot longer there but no game lasts forever.\n\nIf you're an adventure game fan, this has great atmosphere and puzzles and is worth picking up! 8/10!\n\n","July 30, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
