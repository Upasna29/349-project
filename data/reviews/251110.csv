"http://steamcommunity.com/id/baenlynn/recommended/251110/","baenlynn","Bænlynn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/baenlynn/","298 products in account","Infra is not your average game. There are no guns here, but there are still bad guys and monsters. There are no soldiers, spies or saboteurs, but there is a battle taking place. There are no jump scares, creeping horrors, or panicked flights from hordes of undead, but Infra can still scare, unnerve, and frighten you. Just not in the ways that you would expect.\n\nYou take the role of Mark Siltanen an industrial engineer from a firm who has just taken over the maintenance contract for the city of Stahlberg, and you are about to have the bad day to end all others, and maybe everybody else's day toboot.\n\nYou could use the words 'Walking Simulator' to describe Infra, but that definition barely scratches the surface of what's going on here. You could say that Infra is a puzzle game, but you'd only be talking about the tip of the iceberg. You could say that Infra is a job simulator, but you'd still be missing the real point of what is going on.\n\nYes, Infra is an Indie Game, and a bit of a klunky one at times. With a smattering of wooden character sprites and voice acting recorded on what sounds like half a dozen different setups that needs better post production. But that's not why you should buy it. The chewy chocolate-fudge centre of this game may take some of us a little while to get to, but when we do, it should give everyone pause.\n\nIf you've ever worked in one of those big, Star-Wars-scale industrial environments where a moment's inattention in the wrong place can end your life without so much as slowing down the machinery that just turned you into paste then Infra won't take long to get under your skin. The cracks in the walls, the leaky pipes and barely functional equipment. . . If you've ever worked in heavy industry and had to find a new workaround to each successive problem, and/or deal with OHS and get management to take things like this seriously, then the reaction will be instinctive. Like me you'll be thinking about all the dominoes that could be toppled by that half-flooded generator room or tainted water pipe. I realised that the game had me completely immersed when I found myself backtracking time and again to keep turning off the generators in said half-flooded room only to find out I wasn't yet past the point where I needed to have them running.\n\nAt its brilliantly mundane heart, Infra is an interactive cautionary tale, and one that hits close to home for all of us. All around us we are surrounded by tecnologies and systems that we take for granted and that is the spot where Infra builds the edifice of tension that makes up the game's core. Because despite the cinematic license with which Infra's story is presented, the Bad guys and monsters are entirely human, perfectly possible. The horrific scenarios that play out have happened in our world before and they are doing so right now, even as we sit here unaware of their unravelling beneath our feet. Perhaps what is more horrifying is that it doesn't take corporate malfesance and corruption on a grand scale for those little scenarios to play out time and again in the real world. All it takes is a moment's distraction for one person at one step along the long process of getting water from the city dam to your kitchen sink.\n\nGames like Infra should be made, they NEED to be made, and in greater numbers (and yes a little extra polish would be nice too), about things other than psychotically emotionless Space Marines turning the seemingly endless ranks of disposable mooks into hamburger (or some minor variation thereof). Because if Infra can give you pause the next time you take a ride on the subway, the next time you flick a light switch, or turn on a tap, then it has succeeded in a way that few other games can, because you don't have to suspend your disbelief very far at all for Infra to work its magic.","January 16","true","14.6"," 358 of 393 people (91%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","91","358","393","11","8"

I was getting worried with the time it was taking to deliver BUT now that I have seen what they delivered I am blown away. The puzzles are great. They almost reming me of Myst in some regards. And the enviroments are amazing. I wasn't even aware the Source Engine could look this good and run so well. There are a few bugs at the time of this review (launch day) but I have confidence that they will be quickly attended to. The price of 14.99 USD is a very fair asking price for this game.  If you decide to purchase make sure you spend time to explore each area to it's fullest. There are little goodies hidden all around the map.  The subject of the game really is interesting. I found myself wondering about what sort of underground cities are beneath the city I live in and how much effort it must take to keep it running. When walking around INFRA I feel less like I am walking around river controls and steel mills and more like I am walking through an ancient tomb that has become overgrown and has started to decay. I can't wait to see what else these developers have in store for us.\n\nEDIT: This game has no real horror elements. It is more of a puzzle game. That being said  there were several points where I had a chill run down my spine or a feeling that something was not right was felt mostly due to walking through the decaying areas alone with nothing but the sound of wind and the structure creaking around me. It is no walking simulator with the amount of puzzles and a few fast paced scenes. There are no zombies or slendermen or Nazis but the enviroment and the structures are working against you.","January 15","true","10.0"," 96 of 114 people (84%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","84","96","114","7","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brotrrwinner/recommended/251110/","brotrrwinner","ZIGS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brotrrwinner/","811 products in account","Ok, here's the quick and dirty on INFRA: It's a first-person, non-combat puzzle game (much like Portal 2 or The Talos Principle). You'll follow an interesting and mysterious story, explore fantastic urban environments and solve environmental puzzles to progress.\n\nThe game has some flaws, which mainly come from a lack of time/money: the voice acting is dodgy at best, the character models are hilarious (and not in a good way) and even the written English texts have the occasional grammar error and misspelling (the devs are Finnish so that explains it somewhat).\n\nBut none of that matters. After the first level, voice acting is scarce and there's no hideous characters models to look at, only the amazing environments (look at those screenshots!).\nIf you like exploring atmospheric worlds and solve clever and logical puzzles don't even think twice. Buy it.\n\nTHE DREADED "VALUE" QUESTION:\n\nIt's a known fact that most indie games nowadays don't offer much in terms of length and sometimes ask a hefty price. INFRA is the exact opposite. The game costs just 15€ and the first part alone can last you over 10 hours. The second part is coming later this year and it'll be FREE if you already own part 1. That's a lot of high-quality gaming for just 15€ and more devs should follow this example.","January 17","true","16.7"," 71 of 79 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","71","79","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/recommended/251110/","EdenStarGazer","EdenStarGazer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/","429 products in account","Infra is an Indie atmospheric mystery adventure that doubles as a physics puzzler by day, with minimal and realistic platforming.It is a must have for anyone who likes mysteries and crime dramas. I love the genre myself, so was delighted to find something new. With the narrative of Stanley’s Parable, and the stimulating puzzles of Portal, Infra is sure to be worth the price.\n\nPhysics in Motion:\nThings move, and you move with them. The world is more than just a traditional set of “maps.” Each map location contains physically responsive pieces of machinery. These provide open-ended exploration opportunities for the gamer to solve puzzles that were not spoon-fed to him. This one will not insult your intelligence with big arrows on screen shouting, “click here.” Either you find them or you don’t and you keep moving. Nobody’s holding your hand here. And there is none of that, “pile everything up and see what you can craft” mechanics either.\n\nGraphics:\nThe artwork is well done and often panoramic in outdoor scenes. The platforming gives you great chances to see more of the view around the countryside. The graphics are satisfying in a nostalgic way. For a game that makes such low demands on the hardware, the graphics come out mid-range. The locations are mostly dark and dingy so, it is a whole different type of atmosphere, as in Late Garage-Sale/Early Thrift Shop antique furniture. Hitting things causes dust to rise.\n\nSound:\nIt’s easy to get immersed in the sound effects of birds and nature when in the outdoor areas. Ambient effects like birds whistling give it an airy and peaceful feel. I have the deluxe edition with a soundtrack of the ambient music.\n\nLighting Matters:\nColors on puzzles often play optical tricks in less than true color if you don’t check them with the flashlight. Ignore this at your own risk.\nBatteries, though plentiful, have to be located and collected as you go. Only turn on the flashlight to see then cut it right back off, moving without it when you can or you’ll be whining in the dark later.\n\nTelling Story:\nInfra is a story of corporate disillusionment, where corruption has left a man’s dreams as a rotting nightmare. I haven’t finished the game yet, so I have no idea where this is headed. But, I feel like I have walked into the middle of a conspiracy. The story is definitely intriguing and draws you in to complete the missions.\n\nPhotographer:\nYou are chronicling the story as you go, but the mechanics of the camera are highly restrictive in what is considered “correct” evidence of structural damage. Limitations of batteries will force you to think and evaluate machinery, rather than just randomly snapping photos, hoping for something to come out right.\nThe game presents puzzles and keys to proceed through doors, and therefore the story is quite linear. However, the detective work consists in sleuthing out all the hidden codes and evidence alongside the linear route. This lends replay-ability to the game, since you will need more than the first run through to locate all the things you missed.\nI found it important to take screenshots of codes, numbers, and puzzles for further analysis after the first run through, as I have not memorized binary code, and I am not experienced with code-breaking. There are undoubtedly numerous types of codes located throughout for you code-breaking junkies out there.\nThe locations in the story are extremely dilapidated and hazardous to your health. In the first chapters, I thought I would die traversing the electrified water spots. But, I made it through those just fine and broke my neck trying to jump off a roof onto a window ledge. It makes it all the more realistic, because accidents happen when you get too comfortable in a hazardous environment.\n\nChoices:\nAs you play you will find chances to repair things yourself. Your decisions affect the outcome of your play-through. Everything matters. The map is highly accessable, with multiple routes for many of the missions.\n\nPros:\nNot cartoony, and decidedly adult in content/ Not another Nancy Drew or Sherlock Holmes Mystery\nTechnologically and Environmentally relevant plot\nUser-friendly game-play mechanics, real life tools\nVoice acting is enjoyable.\nReal adventure gaming at it’s best.\nMentally challenging / Intelligent puzzles\n\nCons:\nNot an adrenaline ride thus far, just serious crime sleuthing in hazardous environments.\nNo guns… you’re shooting pictures here.\nNo inventory to collect, except those batteries\nNot a point & click Mystery, & no Hidden Object puzzles, I’m sorry.\n\nI highly recommend Infra to gamers in every genre, as it has something for everyone.\nTime in game is sure to vary depending on your code-breaking experience. A simple speed run through could be done in just 3 hours by experienced gamers, where I have 5 hours already and just into the 3rd chapter.  Achievements are nicely aligned to provide something extra for fastidious types who like to find all the details and enjoy the atmosphere. I will certainly be watching Loiste Interactive for more great games. Meanwhile, I have some more clues to find in Infra… and this is just the first episode.","March 4","true","11.2"," 46 of 52 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","46","52","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morphicmetal/recommended/251110/","morphicmetal","morphicmetal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morphicmetal/","3528 products in account","INFRA is a puzzle walking simulator that starts you out investigating problems with a dam that is falling apart in a small town of Stalburg and uncover a conspiracy behind the events leading up to the mismanagement and downfall of these important areas of the town.  You use your camera to find disturbances and clues as to what is happening, as well as taking pictures of any documentation and other evidence that could "aid the cause" of the company you're working with.\n\nI will go through my rundown of what I thought was good and bad, and give a few more tidbits of why I like this game overall, and how I came to giving this one a "thumbs up".\n\n\nPros:\nNice environments and scenery.  Easy to learn the controls, as with many walking sims.\n\nI like the camera in the game.  It's cool seeing the picture in picture, and taking pictures of things that should be repaired, or were neglected.\n\nI enjoy the idea of having to be very observant in order to find things that are not quite right.  It is\nnice since I don't like rushing through games, and promotes slowing down and examining your surroundings.\n\nI like finding the pieces to the broken elements or fixing things along the way.\n\nExpansive game, with a lot more to it than I first thought.  Trying to figure out the puzzles took me a\nwhile to complete many sections of the game.\n\nI like the various traps to overcome, and the changing environment as you get deeper into the game.\n\n\nCons:\nI don't much care for the voice acting, especially when I first started out.  It took some getting used to for me to adjust to it.  I don't really feel much connection with the protagonist either, so that is a little bit dry for me.  I would have liked to have a little more dialog, but at the same time I guess it is in the character's personality to be very matter-of-fact and not the talkative sort.\n\nI did not know you could throw objects you pick up until a good bit later, so I would have liked seeing this in the initial part of the tutorial phase.\n\nThe backtracking and trying to figure out what to do to go onwards can get a little bit frustrating.  It's\neasy to miss something, only to have to backtrack quite a bit in order to move forward in progression.\n\nI can't really tell where each save has me at, if I am curious.  I would really like an area select, so I could work on particular areas again if I wanted to go back.  I'm not sure if there is a way other than the four save slots.\n\nLoading screens are a bit lengthy and break up the continuity and fluidity of the gameplay.  They can take a bit of time.\n\n\nGlitches:\n\nHeard the train horn go off after the train was stopped on the other side of the bridge.  Also I turned around at the train tracks for a second, then when I turned back the train was already at its destination.\n\nSometimes on reloads, certain sound effects would cut out for me.\n\nI had a few times where I got killed in strange ways.  A box near a ledge might turn, and I'd suddenly die.  If I was not careful on my exploration, I might get trapped beside rocks, or other obstacles.\n\nI also trapped myself by doing stupid stuff with items I was able to carry, so use caution when moving these types of things around.  I had to reload a checkpoint or two because of my carefree attitude with things I could grab in the game.\n\nNot so much a glitch, but the controller for me was a little bit clunky, when compared to the mouse.  For example, if I was trying to select something on a computer screen map, I couldn't be nearly as precise as with a mouse.  The same thing if i were interacting with something by looking at it.  Hard to determine where I needed to focus with the controller at times, but zooming in could help a bit sometimes.  I liked having the ability to move between one or the other though.\n\n\nOther Thoughts:\nSave often, as you can get stuck in places, or die, and it will become your checkpoint.  Collecting the items is a nice bonus as well for achievements, if you're into that sort of thing.  They are not so easy to find though, in many cases.  While not gigantic, the game is fairly expansive and immense for something of a walking sim/puzzle.  From my experience, others I have played were much shorter.\n\nAfter finishing one playthrough, I would have to play through again to get the achievements I have missed.  I would have liked to have some kind of level select to try to complete more of my achievements too, but I could not find anything like this.  I believe that would improve the desire to replay the game.  I would love to have some sort of map feature, so I could tell where I am at certain times.  It can get a bit confusing while moving from place to place, and I think this would have enhanced my experience just a bit.  As for resources, I didn't really ever come close to running out of batteries for flashlight or camera, and with proper exploration, they are very plentiful.  I also used both fairly sparingly whenever possible.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this game, and I am glad I played it!  I would recommend to people who are into a more laid back and somewhat relaxing cinematic-style experience.  I could see most people enjoying this game though.  It was a breath of fresh air for me to see the combination of elements put together in the game.  It worked well, I thought.  For me, this fell more in line with that cinematic style, but there are moments where you have to act fast to survive.  I liked the dynamic changing world around you too.  The colors and textures were pleasing to the eye, and I wanted to keep playing, which is a great thing.  I wish there were a little more story involved during your own personal struggle to get through though.  With the place falling apart around you, there were many times you just could not go back, and while I expected bad things to happen, it was still surprising in the well done placement of many of the various dangers.  Great game overall!\n\n** Disclaimer:  I was given a key to review the game.

I've played through part 1 about five times now and I keep finding new secrets, puzzles and alternative routes.\nUrban exploration or infrastructure enthusiasts will especially love it, but I'd recommend it for anyone who likes good settings or atmosphere.\n\nA note on horror: INFRA gets its scares from the oppressive atmosphere of abandoned industrial settings, and its danger from industral hazards and accidents. There are no dogs leaping through windows or posessed pizza parlor animatronics to be found- no jump scares or bleeding walls, either. If you favor that kind of horror, best to look elsewhere- or better yet, try this game for a subtler flavor of fright!","January 20","true","20.9"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","25","26","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/momosrl/recommended/251110/","momosrl","Mvllsk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/momosrl/","328 products in account","Before critizising the game, I got to acknowledge that a lot of work, especially in detailling went into this game. But it seems like the devs put their manhours to the wrong tasks. The levels look pretty but feel very unnatural (unless blocking pretty much every fire escape door and denying access to all non-important doors is some sort of inside joke). The puzzles range from "too easy/obvious" in the form of "get this item and put it here" and simple "read the code on this paper and then switch the right switch" where the code and the switch are always directly next to each other to almost impossible to figure out parts of the game... more often than not you are supposed to pick up or pay attention to things before you see the actual puzzle. Exploration in this game isnt rewarded. I was constantly running low on batteries especially in the mid section of the game since even when exploring you wouldn't find any supplies. Exploring, well the parts that you could explore, lead to nothing and often you just ended up at places you were before. You keep picking up keys (they all look the same) without knowing what they are for.\n\nThe only cool thing that I discovered were a hand full of easter eggs (smaller stuff) and a bunch of codes that seemed important  like the code on the sheet over the corpse, although that one wasnt really "hidden" at all  but even that part didnt save the game. There are better Indie games out there that look better and have a more solid story plus better gameplay. If youre interested in this game, you definitely want to check out The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, as it has a somewhat similar setting but is a better game all around for the same price. I do not recommend this game although I don't think it's terrible. But it's just no fun.","January 16","false","2.1"," 63 of 95 people (66%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","66","63","95","5","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/recommended/251110/","orgelambart","Orge Lambart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/","5483 products in account","INFRA is a mixture of walking simulator and puzzle game.  On the outside looking in a person may shrug and think to themselves, another walker, ugh!!!  (in walker I mean Walking Simulator not the walking dead silly goose).  While this game isn't your typical walking simulator.  The scenery is beautiful, the puzzles can be quite challenging, the game is billed as the first part of a larger series of games, with the sequel set to release sometime in the "near" future..  If you go into the game expecting to whip out your arm cannon, or unload your boom stick, or even blast away creepy crawling monsters you'll be disappointed, no weapons, violence or monsters exist in INFRA, but you will get an amazing experience and a good story, told through various memo's notes, and character dialog.\n\nTech Issue\nI had a few technical issues with my main computer, which was far above what the recommended specs are, and the game crashed to desktop when pushing play, white graphics in doorways, and a few other minor graphical issues.  I could get the game working but typically the moment it had to load, between stages etc, it would crash to desktop and require more tinkering to work.  I did however manage to play the game on my older PC which was barely above the minimum recommendations and it worked flawlessly and looked beautiful  I used every conceivable work around I could think of in order to get the game working on my updated computer but nothing would do the trick for long.  With that said, I'm not sure if it was the game or my computer which caused the issue, so I just wanted to put in here my experience.\n\nThe Story\n\nYou start the game as a man named Mark, he's currently sitting in on a board meeting, the "boss" goes through the specifics of what is required of Mark and his fellow teammates (although you're flying solo this time pal).  The basic story is Mark needs to visit a location and document damages to the structure, while at the same time keeping an eye out for documents which can help explain what brought about the demise of the crumbling buildings and town.   Sounds easy enough, after the meeting which is a 6 to 9 minute affair, you're tasked with searching out supplies, "getting some new markers" and collecting the car keys to drive yourself over to your eventual destination.  What follows is a relatively uninspired trip through an office.. Unfortunately if these guys are "structural" anything, they haven't done a good job as their building has many technical issues, and the elevator can only travel between a few floors...   ANYWAY, after getting your supplies (minus the markers... aww) you make your way to the parking Garage...  after that it's onward to your destination, for puzzles, walking, and possible even a few deaths..  (I totally suggest the moment you get out of truck, head to the left and take a dip in the water.. so warm it's awesome..  sike.. if you do that you're totally gonna die, did I say the game was a swimming simulator?)   From this point on you search around looking for clues, looking for batteries and broken structures to photograph.\n\nPros:\nBeautiful scenery,\nCan be quite challenging to spot the structure issues.\nThe lands are fairly large and interesting\nDoesn't hold your hand... (you won't find no glowing yellow streams in this one)\nPuzzles can be rather difficult to figure out\n\nCons:\nPuzzles can be stupidly easy (although the easy puzzles are few and far between)\nTechnical issues (may have been my computer?)\nVoice acting (the voice acting is like something out of the Playstation 1 era)\nTotal lack of direction or explanation of what your goal is (it's ok to not hold your hand, but at the very least give some idea of what is required to move onto the next portion of the state)\nBacktracking (goes hand in hand with the above mentioned con)\nLoading times can be upwards of a minute (this could be my computer as it had other issues with the game)\nSome clipping issues, which can cause you to get stuck\n\nRecommendation\nWhile I had a few issues with my computer it did sour me a bit, I understand it was probably something on my end rather than the game's end, so I set that aside and will recommend the game based on the merits..  Unlike many of the other Walking Simulators out there, this game actually did a good job of getting the atmosphere right.  The puzzles are challenging for the most part and the scenery is absolutely beautiful.  If you go along and photograph the various documents the story will unfold and as the story unfolds you'll see a grim picture of what happens when a towns infrastructure begins to erode away.","March 16","true","5.3"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","23","26","3","4"

I thought the puzzles were extremely well done personally, they dont have a sort of mad science feel that some other games like this have, its mostly about you controlling stuff to progress on and complete your job (which is to monitor how bad the spot is wrecked so you can begin fixing it).\n\nI've noticed it had the tag of horror but I wouldn't really agree with that, I didnt come across anything that made me feel uneasy at all, it was just quite atmospheric throughout. By the way you dont get attacked by anything like in a survival horror game. I felt that was something I should mention because I was concerned about that throughout.\n\nThe story is pretty decent to, the game tells the tale of an economic collapse of an entire region, and you get to experience how it progressed to where it was by looking through notes and areas that you experience when going through the game. I began by not really careing all too much and didnt pay that much attention to the newspaper articles littered through the world, but then towards the end I started to read through them and found them to be quite interesting, so my recommendation was if you get it do that from the start :).\n\nThis game has a great atmosphere too, in particular theres a section where you go into an abandoned steel factory and lose connection with the outside world, and it feels really earie which I guess explains the horror tag. The sound was done really well in this area too, mostly silent with a low bassy hum of I guess the old poweplant?\n\nSpeaking about sound, I really liked the soundtrack for the game and I felt that it fit well with each section, so if you have a few extra pennies I'd say its worth buying it.\n\nMy time played shows roughly how long the game lasts, and I'd say its not bad for a small indie game, infact quite good. Theres also multiple collectables and stuff you can go back and do for the achievements giving you a reason to play it again, which you know, its always a positive.\n\nBad Bits:\n\nAlthough I really enjoyed my experience with INFRA theres a few points I think you should know:\n\n1. The voice acting at the start was pretty bad, the characters other than your own didnt feel genuine at all and the animations of the people were lacking quite a bit (but this goes away after about the first 15 mins or so, so dont worry about that too much).\n\n2.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/supernaut/recommended/251110/","supernaut","supernaut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/supernaut/","241 products in account","I was expecting a 4-hour game at best, but instead I got 18 hours of enjoyable exploration and puzzle solving set entirely in Finland, as it should be used more as a setting and not just for sports games. And that's just Part 1. I can't imagine how many more locations are in store in Part 2, which will be a free update, when I've already experienced the length of at least two modern FPS games for €15. Not only is it a refreshing change of setting from your usual New Yorks or what have you, though any city would work here, it's also inspired by a documentary about deteriorating infrastructure. That fact alone fills me with confidence that games as an art form is in safe hands. It's a fascinating choice of subject matter for a developer's first game and not in any way presented through a prism of science fiction or a military conflict, which is usually the choice for first-person games set in crumbling cities.\n\nInstead of having a decaying city as a backdrop, it's a character of the story. A victim of neglect, rivaling companies and corruption. You're tasked with surveying the structural damage of the city of Stalburg by taking photos of the damage. Finding documents and tapes people have left behind, you start to piece together where it all went haywire. You work your way through a maze of different locations, each of them detailed to the point of being believable, but not impressive by standards available to those with a huge budget. This being a crowd-funded game however, the scope and level of detail achieved here is shocking for a team of just 6 people, according to the credits.\n\nINFRA removes the guns, the aliens or bad guys with guns and you're left with elements that every great FPS relies on: exploration, environmental storytelling, quiet moments, puzzle solving, dealing with obstacles, etc. It's a game of valves, switches, key cards, buttons, turning it off, turning it on, reading notes and instructions to operate machinery and I loved every minute of it. You can find most of these in every notable FPS since the days of DOOM. The reason I'm emphasizing these is because the devs have honestly described what their game is about. It's not overburdened by pointless distractions that only create the illusion of immediacy and importance. What you're doing here is important in and of itself. The game sends a strong message of being responsible with the world around you, which is, among all these hugely expensive and ultimately pointless games, thoroughly heartwarming and commendable. Not to mention rare.\n\nCouple of moments where I couldn't figure out how to progress, so I consulted a video walkthrough, but I'm more bummed about the the stuff I didn't know how to repair. You're stuck between analyzing and trying to leave a place in a better shape than it was, but many of the bigger puzzles tied to achievements I just couldn't figure out, so grudgingly I had to move on. Thankfully there are no easy-to-use guides out there yet, so you can actually enjoy the puzzles as opposed to following a step-by-step guide on how to restore the functions of all these different facilities. There is damage, or scripted moments, that's unavoidable, but instinctively you try to be responsible where you can. These places have been abandoned, reminiscent of Pripyat, but the machinery still has life left in it, which continue to do damage.\n\nThe overall aesthetic reminded me of STALKER meets Half-Life 2, so a big thank you for Loiste Interactive in filling a gap that certain developers have failed to do for too long. To crawl through vents and solve puzzles is not to be underestimated, guns or no guns. While I eventually gave up on reading newspapers or longer notes, towards the end, I'm very much interested in how the story will progress in Part 2 and I look forward to taking more photos and solving puzzles. Somehow I've managed to ignore the elephant in the room. The voice acting of the player character is atrocious, but it steadily grows on you at a snail's pace, cos it's just so bad that it becomes almost cute. There is a lack of polish here, but that didn't stop Shadow of Chernobyl in becoming one of the best games of all time. You have to let a few things slide in order to get something special out there and that's fine, cos it's important that we get to play this in its current form than not at all.","April 22","true","20.3"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CathyDeMaple/recommended/251110/","CathyDeMaple","CathyDeMaple","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CathyDeMaple/","156 products in account","INFRA is definitely one of the best indie games I have played that have come out of the source engine. It takes wondrous care in it's level design and mechanics that topple many of the other games out there. It scares you with every day things, nothing supernatural except you own imagination. Even though I do recomend this to anyone with any interest in puzzle, exploration, story or even real-life urban exploring there are a few major problems that this game have that are purely to do with immersiveness, user learning and user preferences.\n\nFirst off, there is no options menu in-game. You can save, load and all that but no options to find keybindings, change mouse sensitivity, or any of the normal stuff. This is really quite irritating especially when there is no information given during the game as to what buttons to press for the flashlight and camera. That said, there is a pop up telling you to press R for switching batteries when you have to. This needs to be implemented for when you get the devices. tutorials are important, especially without an in-game keybindings screen.\n\nSecondly, it is very annoying to me when I find this many grammatical and spelling errors everywhere in the game. In a discoverable office early on there are some logs that are written with many spelling mistakes and general sloppiness like "close of bankcrupty" and "waiting receiving the funds". These errors really take away from the immersiveness of this lovely game for me. Not saying that these errors can't be good if done right, but there are just so many and the game offers no lore-friendly explanation for them.\n\nFinally, the voice acting is really quite bad in some areas, with much of the scripting following the errors in the writing. I actually feel like I am in The Room (movie) with everything combined. Something I think also ties in with this is when you talk to the office workers at the beginning. They have voices, but no animations.\n\nAll that in consideration, this is still an amazing game with even more amazing potential in the future. I am judging this at the same level I would judge games by EA and Valve, which is saying a heck of a lot for an indie title. If you read all this and are still considering whether or not to buy the game, do it. The gameplay is unique in so many ways it just doesn't compare.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/251110/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2000 products in account","INFRA is a first person puzzle adventure game with a very mysterious tone to it. While some may call it a “walking simulator”, I personally disagree, most of all due to the fact that INFRA allows you to take different routes and solve puzzles in different ways.\n\nFirst off, it is necessary to say that at the moment only Part 1 of the game is available. The developers are already hard at work on Part 2 but, as of now, there is no estimated release date and the first part ends somewhat abruptly.\n\nI was really surprised as I began to play this, that right from the start the game doesn’t hold your hand. Even though it is a linear game, you are able to explore your surroundings within certain limits. The game also doesn’t give you an objective so sometimes you might have a hard time figuring out what exactly you have to do or where you need to go. That said, even though you’ll encounter multiple puzzles, they are not mandatory but they might give you access to documents that can provide you with some background information on certain events that could potentially shed some light on the mystery you’re trying to solve.\n\nStory:You play as Mark, a structural analyst that is sent on a job to survey some old structures for potential degradation. What begins as just another day at work, quickly turns into a series of events that test his dexterity and resilience.\n\nAt the beginning you’ll most likely find yourself lost and with no idea of what is going on but slowly throughout the game you’ll find clues that will reveal why these events are taking place and who is responsible for them. This was one of the reasons why I ended up exploring a lot and looking for as many documents and audio logs as I could. The world surrounding you seems so mysterious at first but you’ll gradually get to know the city past, its history, how it became an industrial power and what led to its demise.\n\nGameplay:INFRA mechanics will be explained to you very early on and they are really simple but yet, they add a whole other layer to the game. The most important one is your camera. You can use it to photograph evidence of structural damage and documents that contain information relevant to your case. Assuming you’re actually interested and immersed in the world, this mechanic adds a lot to the game. I often found myself looking at every single structure I came across looking for damage, and still, I only found around 50% of the evidence in the game.\n\nOne other mechanic that also plays a huge role is climbing. You can climb any object, assuming it is not very high, by just getting closer to it and jumping. Of course you can also jump in the “normal way” like in most first person games and this will also allow you to overcome some of the deadly traps that await you.\n\nThe puzzles in INFRA are varied but most of them involve activating switches or finding missing electrical components. Some of them are very easy and its answer will be obvious you right from the start. Others however, left me going back and forth on the level looking for hints and activating several switches in order to get them right which sometimes was rather tedious, especially on larger levels.\n\nVisuals & sound:One thing that became pretty clear for me since the very start, was the fact that the voice acting is very subpar. This kind of voice acting combined with the lack of dialogue didn’t leave a lot of room to get attached to the main character.\n\nStill, the game has great sound design with background noises and overall the music is pretty great as well. While the graphics close on are somewhat dated, from a reasonable distance they allow for quite the scenery. You’ll be exploring gorgeous open door environments, dark tunnels and abandoned buildings. Each of these places has its own unique markings, either it’s an old dam, an ancient tunnel or an abandoned industrial complex from the early 1900’s which make the game world feel a lot more real. All these aspects combined, provide for an amazing and relaxing experience\n\nComplaints:- Loading times can take up to 30-40 seconds\n- I experienced some framerate variations (even though I’m way above the recommended system specs), one second I’d have over 100 fps and the next moment it would dip down to the 40s and sometimes even lower\n- The game auto-saves but there is also an option for manual saving. The problem I have with this is that you have 4 different save slots but it easily gets very confusing which save is which because the game gives you no indication other than “Save Slot 1”, “Save Slot 2”, etc.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nEven though only Part 1 is available, INFRA is well worth your time. It is a mysterious and engaging experience that conveys the story by narrative means other than dialogue. It has its relaxing and tense moments and, most importantly, it lets the player choose if they just want to storm through the scenarios or explore them meticulously looking for clues of the towns past and the whole mystery surrounding this structural degradation. I highly recommend INFRA to any fans of adventure or mystery games or to people who are looking to enjoy a nice and relaxing scenery.","March 19","true","11.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","6"

Currently I don't know if it's worth $15, but the developers are going to add further parts for no cost to those who own it, so it will be worth it in time.\n\nPlot: The story feels a bit forced, but it is interesting, and fits very well with the concept of the game. It has a lot of potential for advancement, and is left on a cliffhanger that does work. I'm looking forward to the continuation with the updates.\n\nPuzzles: The puzzles are Portal-style; built into the level, completing them is the only way to get through. There's a mix of physics puzzles, jumping puzzles, and others that incorporate many different concepts and features into them. Some are easy, some are very hard, but I was able to get through all of them except one without having to look on the discussion forums, and in that case, it was because the instructions were poorly worded. Here's a tip; remember to always look at EVERYTHING in the area. There are a few puzzles that I feel are unnecessarily hard, and one or two instances where the instructions themselves are unclear (water treatment plant...) but you can work past them, and the developers are very active on the forums answering questions if it comes to that.\n\nGraphics: The game is gorgeous. There are some incredible locations, both outdoors and indoors. Some of the locations remind me of the coastal area in Half Life 2, but much more beautiful. So while the game produces plenty of great outdoor scenes, the indoor locations also do not fall to the tendency that games have to make their indoor locations boring and dark. The indoor locations feel varied but familiar, with new visuals every time.\n\nSounds: The sound design is pretty good, nothing to phone home about. There isn't much you can do with this kind of a game, but it feels atmospheric, which is about all is needed, I guess. Voice acting could use some work, particularly the main character, but it is far from game-breaking. The music is pretty average throughout, but there are a few points where just the right piece starts playing at just the right moment, creating a fantastic feeling.\n\nOverall, if you like puzzles, I would recommend this game. The first part of the story took me about 9.3 hours to complete, with a pretty average amount of struggling, so with the updates, there will be enough content to make it worth it. If you've always wanted to be able to explore infrastructure (like me), this will be a blast. I can't vouch for its accuracy, but it feels realistic, and that's pretty much all I care about. I'm looking forward to what kind of new locations I'll get to explore in the next chapter.","January 19","true","9.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

It has it's flaws, and it can be frustrating at times for all the wrong reasons, but the effort put in to the locations and enviroments shines through. The one thing that stood out for me the most was the realism I got from the sheer attention to detail. The devs have clearly done their location research, starting all the way with the office at the beginning, through to every piece of infrastructure in the game. Occasionally some breaks from reality are present for gameplay reasons (our protagonists rather liberal interpretation of health and safety protocols included, as well as the general lack of safety features within the infrastructure, though the story may give some reasons for this), but from the offices to the shop floor, there was a definite sense of immersion that came with such realistic detail.\n\nMy main critcisms would be that it relies a little too much on "first person platforming", much like half-life did back in the day, the puzzles often rely on obscurity rather than logic (though this may have been a good thing, real infrastructre doesn't want to make you solve the soup cans before shutting down a malfunctioning turbine!), and sometimes it's not obvious what your immediate objective is, particularly as there are often multiple paths which can leave you worried you've missed something.\n\nOverall, a great game for the price, and worth it for an enjoyable weekend play.","February 7","true","13.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

It pains me give this a thumbs down, since I can see the great effort that was put into it, but all that effort just didn't make this game enjoyable in any way for me.\n\nLet me break this game down for you. You'll spend:\n85% of the time walking around with awkward controls and no BGM\n5% of the time solving ridiculously easy puzzles\n4% of the time trying to take pictures of what the game considers to be worth reporting to your boss\n3% of the time trying to make sense of puzzles that just don't make any sense (or maybe they don't work as they should? I'm not sure by now)\n2% of the time finding out bits of the main story, which is not one bit captivating, or maybe it takes too long to become interesting\n1% of the time doing some very clumsy platforming\nSeriously, it's been a while since I got that bored by a game. Here are some more cons (I honestly can't think of a pro, except all the effort that you see put into this game):\n\nFlashlight and camera have limited energy, fed by the few batteries you find lying around, and they deplete REALLY, REALLY fast, so it ruins the part of exploring to take pics\nAutosaves seem to trigger only the first time you move by a specific spot. If you backtrack for 5 minutes, slip and fall to your death, you have to walk back for 5 minutes again\nGraphics are not beautiful, and I'd even say ugly if you considerer how much of your PC it uses (in comparison, Ethan Carter is stunningly beautiful and doesn't stutter at all for me)\nYou can take photos, but you can't see them. You don't have a map, and you can't take a picture of the many maps you can see around (only as a screenshot, but...)\nI've mentioned controls are awkward, and I meant that with M&K. I love playing with a controller, but that was just way to bad to be playable. No in-game remapping for controller, either, No way of changing camera speed etc etc etc.\nTerrible, terrible VO (I know some characters, as the main character, are not native English-speakers, and I take that into consideration when I say that).\nSo I've played this longer than I should, because I really wanted to like it. Well, I didn't. I'm glad I won this game and didn't spend my own money on it, but I feel sorry for the guy who did. =/","April 9","false","7.4"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","0"

It has a very nice graphic, a good background sound, nice gameplay and a decent story. Everything, a good game needed.\n\nThe game starts in a conference room where you wait for your boss and some work colleagues, they talk about work and what to do in future and you have to click some “PowerPoint”.

So I go throw the bureau and find all the things. That is how the game is all the time only in little.  Now I have to find the garage in basement, everything is broken, oh my god, go down the stairs, use the elevator, find the door key…ten minutes later…get into the car.

The glowy lighting was also pleasnt to look at. Wandering around all the abandoned environments was such a unique experience. I think I will play through this again in the near future, just for the atmosphere.\n\nThe only negatives I have with this game, are (for me) finding frame drops in places with lots of water, sometimes my player would just get stuck in between machinery sequences, and finally,\nthe biggest negative I have with this game, is the fact that Part 2 is not being released tommorow! :)\n\nExcellent game!","January 21","true","12.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","3"

I've done that. I most likely would have never known about this game if it wasn't for the steam coupon I had from leveling up my account. $5 for this game? I'll try it out. I'm glad I did.\n\nFirst off, I want to say that a lot of effort went into making this game. You can tell. While there might be an overuse of the "locked door senario" to keep the areas to an easy semi-liniar path, there were some areas where I felt I was really there exploring it.\n\nSome advice. Turn the Gamma up, or you aren't going to see the puzzles in some spots. Took me a while to figure out what I was doing wrong. Also, save frequently, just in case you encounter a very unusual glitch (like me when I raft rode and got stuck in a game-over loop).\n\nPros:\nGreat Maps\nSome Great Puzzles\nGreat Idea (Not the typical action game)\nThere's more to come (Ep 2 free for people that buy part 1)\n\nCons:\nSome puzzles were overly finiky\nA few bugs (Most notably the missing valve in one part (fixed in update), and the raft riding part where it auto saved me to a point where I was stuck in a game over loop.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalkkis/recommended/251110/","kalkkis","Boomstick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalkkis/","101 products in account","This is not a bad game, it's rather nice, but it is unfinished.\n\nI hope I will rewrite this review when the game gets patched a few more times, and hope to change my recommendation to thumbs up. Currently the game is a drag, and that's a shame, because I really want to like this game. It has a unique atmosphere and does (tries to do) something different from most games today. I wouldn't have bothered to write this review if I didn't like this game, but in it's current state I cannot recommend it.\n\nMy main issue is that it feels very much like an alpha release, and definitely should still be in Early Access. But as that is not the case, I fear some of the weird design features will not be rectified. I will list a few issues I have with the game below.\n\nThe game world is not logical. It appears to be, but is far from it. Abandoned places still have electric lights on, and every place is generally too well lit; makes me wonder why do I even have a torch with me. People have left notes lying around which are obviously there to help me, but would make no sense in a real world. Usually these notes are right next to the puzzle and basically tell you how to solve it, so it's not really a puzzle but "follow instructions" type of a problem. I got stuck at the sawmill for several hours because I didn't notice an attic window, which for some unnatural reason had a plank protruding from it, and I was supposed to go through there. Never in my life I've seen something like that in real life, so I didn't think to look for it. It makes sense in game, kinda, but I've never liked puzzles which do not rely on real world logic but impose their own on the player. There are other kind of logical problems which break the immersion, like finding a dead body but not reporting it to anyone immediately, and halting a train but not communicating to the crew in any way, etc.\n\nThere are several places in the game world where you can get stuck, like falling between some rocks. Otherwise the character can climb low obstacles, but apparently 50 cm of rock is too much for him. This wouldn't be a problem, as most of these places are off the beaten path, but the game suggests that it rewards exploration. And I like that, it's nice that there are places you can walk around, which are there just for the atmosphere, but as it is, it's way too easy to get stuck or fall into water (instadeath, naturally). This is all made worse by the save game system, which doesn't tell you which save slot you used last (nor name the saves), and doesn't ask if you want to overwrite your last save. Additionally you can also get to areas from which you cannot go back, so saves are somewhat important, yeah.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty bad, but okay I guess for an indie developers budjet. The English used in the notes found in game is rather awful, with a lot of typos and poor grammar. Almost every note found has some mistakes in it. Another thing related to this is the weird nation the game takes place in, as it seems to be some sort of strange hybrid of Finland, USA, UK and some East European countries. The main character speaks like he's Slavish, but still speaks in (very broken) English, and most of the names are English as well, yet there are some Finnish products and words here and there. Pontikka is moonshine in English, so why would the characters in game use the Finnish word? This would've worked so much better if the whole game was set in Finland, or if the protagonist or another major character was Finnish living in whatever country this is supposed to be set in. Being a Finn myself, I'd love to see a pretty game like this set in Finland.\n\nThe main character's camera uses AA batteries and runs out of them after a couple of shots, doesn't zoom or record video, and you cannot look at what pictures you have taken. I guess the state of decay extends to the city officials equipment as well. The protagonist should know his camera is a POS, and pack extra batteries, but no, he prefers to rely on luck, finding fresh batteries in buildings abandoned for years or decades. Feels like a producer told the dev team that if there aren't any guns, there still should be reloading and ammo pickups. Please. Hunting for batteries adds nothing to the game and is just plain irritating. The fact that you can't look at the pictures you've taken is also a missed opportunity, as taking a picture of a found schematic and checking it from the camera later when you actually have to solve a puzzle would make much more immersive gameplay than finding the instructions right next to every puzzle.\n\nThe good? As I stated above, the game is unique in atmosphere. Mix of slow paced exploration and puzzle solving is a great idea, and at times works very well. The game looks good enough, but runs very unevenly, freezing sometimes for no reason for a second or two, and having other graphical glitches like doorways that are nothing but bright white light until you walk through them. The sounds are good and the sparsely used music fits the game well. The environments are somewhat unusual for games, as there are areas which seem to offer nothing but places to walk around. I like that, makes the world feel all the more real. Many of the puzzles are fun enough and most of the locations look like they could actually exist. This is by no definition a bad game, but it could be so much better than it currently is.\n\nI haven't finished the game yet, so maybe there are more things I'll like later in the game, I don't know. Had to stop playing because it got so annoying to deal with everything above that I had to write this review. Currently I can only enjoy this game if I play it 15-20 minutes at a time, any longer and I want to rip my eyes out, out of pure frustration. This has the potential to be an amazing game, and I won't give up on it.

INFA delivered on all fronts.  My first play through took about 15 hrs (currently at 65 hrs and have played through the game at least 4 times looking for achievements).  I'm looking forward to episode 2 (which will be free for those who purchase episode 1).  I have really enjoyed my time with this game.\n\nI would describe INFRA as an environmental puzzle game with a decades old conspiracy story at its heart.  You play a structural engineer working for a private firm which has just been awarded a contract to manage infrastructure maintenance for Stalburg, a fictional European city.  You are sent to survey bridges, a dam, a power plant, etc. and document (i.e. photograph) any need for repairs.  Along the way you uncover documents about an old conspiracy which led to the city's current state disrepair.\n\nThe game starts off somewhat slow in terms of puzzle solving and ends with nearly one puzzle right after another.  There is plenty to do.  The game is not open world but offers a decent amount of urban exploration of decaying infrastructure along with some beautiful views.  There's also a pervasive undercurrent of dry humor which I really enjoyed.\n\nPuzzle difficulty ranges from almost too simple to extremely difficult.  Most deal with manipulating machinery of some kind, although there are some platforming puzzles too.  There are some crisis situations where you just die, die, and die again until you figure things out.  Not my favorite type of puzzle, but fortunately autosave checkpoints are really well done to minimize frustration.  (You can also save anywhere.)  Coded messages are also hidden in the game.  Some in binary, others encrypted.  I'm not really into that sort of thing, but I appreciate it being there for those that are.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game is actually just moving around.  I'm forever getting caught up on doorways, ladders, railings, low ceilings.  Maybe that's just a product of the Source engine, maybe it's just me.  There's also a battery requirement for the flashlight and camera.  Batteries run out quite fast in this game.  There are plenty of batteries to be found though, no need to be miserly with either.  Perhaps the batteries were a game mechanic meant to encourage exploration.  Regardless, it can get exapserating with how frequently you need to replace them.\n\nINFRA is a bit rough around the edges.  Some parts of the game are beautiful and some parts look unfinished or unpolished.  The voice acting ranges from fine to bad.  The underlying logic of why you need to solve X to accomplish Y is sometimes missing, or mystifying.  The puzzles themselves were not hard to recognize and there are usually notes or hints to guide you to solutions.\n\nI recommend this game if you are into puzzle games like Portal, the Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and The Talos Principle.  INFRA is roughly in the same vein.  INFRA's pros outweigh its cons and absolutely delivers on urban exploration and puzzle solving.","February 13","true","182.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I usually have no interest in these puzzle games but INFRA is an exeption as I've followed the development for many years. And I also love games using the Source engine so of course I had to give it a go.\n\nI don't want to bore you with a long review where I point out every single thing that I liked or disliked so I'll keep it short. I also hope one of the developers read this review as I think that I make some interesting points.\n\nSo what is INFRA?INFRA is a game based around puzzle solving and exploration. It's based in modern times but you spend the majority of your time in abandoned buildings/areas. You encounter some puzzles along the way that you have to solve. Some are easy, some.. not so much.\n\n\nThe goodThe level design is absolutely amazing. To see how much they managed to squeeze out of the good old Source engine is beyond what I could have imagined.\nThere's an interesting story to it which encourages you to progress and explore further.\nThere's a good amount of puzzles to keep you occupied throughout the game.\nAnd then there's multiple approaches to pretty much everything.\nThe developers are showing great interest in the people who are playing it and are helping them out here on Steam!\n\nThe badI'd like to mention first of all that I got stuck twice in my first playthrough due to crashes and bugs. Most of this has already been fixed though.\nThe game is confusing at times. There's not much guidance for what you're doing so you keep asking yourself if this is the right thing. There are notes throughout the game that can help you solve the puzzles but you're not guaranteed to find them due to the multiple approaches.\nThe multiple approaches makes you wonder if you've missed something. Would I have found a key to this door if I had gone the other way? Am I even supposed to go this way?\nThe voice acting is not great. I don't mind the accent, it just gets annoying at times, especially the player's voice. He keeps pointing out the obvious. "Somebody should fix this","I'm pretty sure that's not meant to be like that", "A pack of spare batteries for the flashlight", "A pack of spare batteries for the camera", "I should have brought my other boots","Fascinating", "Interesting", and so on. You really don't need to point out the obvious, after all, I did make you pick up those batteries.\n\nWhy not use the player's voice to help out the player? Something like "I wonder if I could get up there" or "Maybe if I can find a way to smash this". There's a bit of this towards the end of the game but I really would have liked it earlier on. (And it certainly could have helped me) I don't want it to give it away but maybe if you can tell that the player is struggling, help them out?\n\nAll in all, a very solid game and I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a bit of puzzle solving and/or exploration! If you want to avoid getting stuck because of bugs, wait a few weeks before buying and then I'm sure they've been fixed.\n\nAnd a shoutout to one of the developers, Oskutin, for helping me out! ( I broke the game :D )\n\n\n\n","January 18","true","9.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

INFRA is on par with some of the greats in terms of atmosphere, like S.T.A.L.K.E.R, Metro, Half-Life, Bioshock, old school Silent Hill, or even the more recent Soma. The world is beautifully designed. The detail is incredible, and every building/area seems to be meticulously designed and unique in it's own way. Visually, the game is quite appealing, and impressive for a game running on Source. The environment strikes a nice balance; it is realistic and believable, yet remains imaginative throughout the story.\n\nReally, if you took away the poor voice acting and sometimes poorly written notes, you would be left with a game that doesn't look or feel Indie.\n\nMy main complaint is that it is far too short and ended quite abruptly, though the price reflects that.

INFRA is packed full of little details. It definitely rewards you for exploring and being observant. These rewards range from simple easter eggs to shortcuts. Puzzles in INFRA can have multiple solutions. You can get to the other side of a door by cunning navigation or clever circumventing. Because of these multiple routes, there are many offshoots (not complete branches because they connect back to the trunk quickly) that make the game feel organic and immersive. This game is definitely replayable as you will miss things the first time through.\n\nLet's talk about the bad a little bit. So while on the whole, I thoroughly enjoy the puzzles in this game, they don't scale well. What I mean by this is that rather than having puzzles that get trickier as you progress through the game, the puzzles get harder to solve because the pieces become hidden. My favorite part of putting together a puzzle isn't the part where I have to dig in the couch cushions because I think I lost a piece. So while this can make simple things take longer it does have the upside of forcing you to explore the world more and none of the pieces were ever hidden in a way that I thought was unfair.\n\nOn the balance, the experience and mystery of this game significantly outweighs the frustrations of having wasted an hour because you didn't look behind a door or in a box.\n\nMy playthrough: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL5JEFvVpx9oRUnwXp-tzlYvT6ea990wS","April 6","true","10.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

No guns – the only things you'll be shooting are pictures; minimal inventory – just your camera, flashlight, batteries for both, and whatever random bit of the environment you're lugging around at the moment, whether that be a fuse that belongs in a fusebox somewhere, a crate you'll need to cross a pool of electrified water, or an empty beer bottle that's just lying around, waiting to be smashed.\n\n\nInfrastructure Isn’t Sexy\n\nYou play an engineer who works for a fictional Baltic country's infrastructure inspection service (in case you're wondering, the developers are based in Finland). Your job is to go out to inspect dams, highways, bridges – all the little things that make life easier, but could cause disasters if they break. And boy, do they ever break.\n\nIn a nice nod to just how things work in the real world (channeling John Oliver here), the nation's infrastructure – and the agency itself – is pretty blatantly underfunded. Even your starting office area is badly in need of repair, and only sparsely staffed. The workers hanging around complain about unsafe – but heavily used – tunnels that they refuse to drive through because they know just how bad they are.\n\nThe plot of the game kicks off with a typical, monotone office meeting (which, mercifully, you can skip), explaining where to go (a local abandoned dam system) so that you can gather photographic evidence of the repairs that need to be done, as well as doing patch jobs on whatever you can. Using your camera (or flashlight) drains batteries like crazy, but you can find plenty of them as you go along. The only downside is that there is no real way to tell how many batteries of each type you have left, aside from your character's comments when picking up fresh packs or installing a new set. The digital camera – which helpfully adjusts its viewfinder whenever you point it at something you need to photograph, has a battery meter; the flashlight just grows dimmer and dimmer to the point of uselessness, as its way of saying “Feed me!” The whole short battery lifespan thing is par for the course for a video game – but, obviously, they only drain when they are active (this includes looking around with the camera out).\n\nYour secondary purpose, along the way, is to figure out why the place was abandoned in the first place – and you can even find some evidence pointing to this in your home office if you explore it thoroughly enough. It looks like a profound lack of funding might not be the only problem with this country.\n\n\nDam It\n\nINFRA uses standard WASD for movement controls, E to interact, R to reload batteries, F to toggle the flashlight; jump, crouch, pickup/drop/throw – you know the drill. All fairly standard FPS-type controls. Spinning the mouse wheel toggles the camera, and clicking it zooms in or out. For better or for worse, there’s no HUD, and no inventory screen.\n\nIf you don't quite make a jump, you just get kicked back a few seconds of gameplay. They want you to play the game, not re-do ten minutes of running around every time you miss a jump by a few pixels. There are no enemies save for the environment itself – a few feet of water, most falls, etc. will one-shot kill you if you're not careful, along with the more obvious deathtraps such as the aforementioned electrified pools of water. For certain scripted, survivable falls, your character will have something to say about that, complete with some colorful language.\n\n\nGraphics and Sound\n\nThe game is simply gorgeous at maxed visuals, even on a mid-range graphics card (GeForce 660). Old crumbling bricks and concrete, rust-covered metal, faded glass, and flowing water all contribute nicely to the atmosphere of the game, while providing an effective contrast to the relative sterility of your equally-in-need-of-repair home office. The dam and its environs feel abandoned and empty, even if most of the vehicles you find look brand new, and have been polished to a mirror shine!\n\nThe ambient noises that comprise much of the soundtrack accompany the visuals well – birds chirping out in the wilderness, winds rushing down deserted corridors, water dripping off of rusty pipes, etc.\n[Eric Kei]\n\nSummary\nINFRA is a nice break from the run-of-the-mill first person games. They take a topic that most people find exceedingly dull, but with a touch of mystery, some entertaining gameplay mechanics, and excellent visuals, turn it into something worth sinking several hours into – and it's longer than you might think. A true exploration game.\n\nhttp://www.dlh.net/en/reviews/2128/infra--pc-.html","May 23","true","5.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

About half of the building is unavailable to explore, but you can see through the many big windows that more than a lot of time and effort has gone into this building alone. The building is only a fraction of the game and it would already make up one of the best maps for an online FPS.\n\nAnyway, your job turns from bad to worse when you go to visit and report deteriorating infrastructure. I will avoid spoiling any more of the game so you can experience it for yourself. Just expect to spend a lot of time exploring places that the people at Loiste didn't need to add, but added anyway, which made the game just that little bit more detailed and affected the overall amenity of the game in the long run.\n\nThe game can be compared to a not-so-scary version of Outlast, in that you are navigating dark areas with a camera. Unfortunately your camera doesn't have a built-in flashlight, so you carry one seperate (which if the developers had thought through, you would be able to smack some stuff with.) The camera and flashlight both have batteries that drain unbelievably fast though, so you must find some new ones lying around in convenient places. Not to worry, there are more than enough lying around!\n\nAs you can see, I am so far, very impressed with INFRA. It has some very meticulous developers and the environmental graphics are brilliant (the humans could use some more detail though, but the environment makes up for that.) The sound effects in the game make the game a bit eerie and - although it is a completely non-violent game - it does get a bit spooky (especially when you take a picture of something out of the ordinary, that sound caught me off guard a few times.)\n\nThe game plays nicely once you manage to load it up without crashing, Sometimes it crashes on launch, sometimes mid-game, sometimes when I'm trying to quit. No game is without problems, though.\n\nOverall, the game is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone who likes exploration, attention to detail and/or taking photos.\n\nI rate it 8/10 very detailed koalas.\n","May 14","true","3.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Toikka/recommended/251110/","Toikka","Toikka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Toikka/","1026 products in account","A thoroughly enjoyable, beautiful exploration game with plenty of great ideas only lacking in polish and general quality assurance. Some of the puzzles throughout the game are brilliant, but others are really not that good (I'm looking at you, raft section and all the elecrified floor jumpathons). I like the scandinavian aesthetic as I am a Finn myself (really brought me back to my heydays in Kontula with the above ground segments) and I really loved the nature segments as well.\n\nAbove all, the game really needs some solid hints. I got through most of the game without a hitch, but some solutions are not so obvious and could use for example the player's voice to guide through them. I think there should be a prelude "routine infrastructure case" before coming to the office, a small tutorial course where you need to photograph, flashlight and get used to the mazelike urbex gameplay of INFRA. The game could really use one where you learn some not-so-obvious things like stacking crates and such. I really loved the office, but only in hindsight as it's a bit too good at showcasing the gameplay elements...it's just too much too fast and might scare more casual players away.\n\nI gotta hand it to you Oskutin & friends, the level design is phenomenal. There are some really amazing vistas and you managed to squeeze everything out of Source. I loved the blast furnace tower. I really really loved the little landscapes near the dam and the little suburban canal section. Top marks on the hacker den too - that place was fun as hell to go through. The waterfalls, the dam, everything is so peaceful, serene yet manage to get the atmospheric 'spooky' factor to the max.\n\nThe unpolishness is making this a bit of a tough sell. There's a LOT of spelling errors, confusing sentences and overall weirdness going about. In my playthrough, none of the audiologs worked so I didn't get much out of the storyline. I'll play it through again when part 2 is out (lovely cliffhanger by the way). You really need someone to fix those quirks in text and script when you get around finishing the entire experience.\n\nThere are also quite a few bugs. Physics glitches, sound issues and such were thankfully quite fast patched, but there are some lingering issues that almost all pertain to the engine itself. There's a crane that can detach its load in late chapter 5 that can kill your playthrough unless you reload a checkpoint, if you do things in wrong order with a certain forklift. There's some inconsistencies in level design where that cool area you found might not go anywhere at all. There's the infuriating pixel-perfect-or-you're-dead raft section that makes me want to skewer the one who okay'd that through QA. I hope these gets fixed after part 2 is out, since these really destroy the immersion and experience.\n\nAnd boy, what an experience it is. I'm almost inclined to go romping around abandoned factories and facilities in real life after having so much fun exploring these urban ruins. The camera mechanic is genius, if only you'd give more batteries to play around with. The puzzles are creative and the nice crisis scenes you get from time to time are well thought out and executed. A phenomenal title focused solely on urbex and puzzling, beautifully laid out in an urban yet natural scandinavian wonderland. Few more spit shine polish elements and I'd give this a solid 10/10, but I'll have to go with 8/10, with one point out for repeated 'electrified water' and 'stack the boxes' gags and the second one for unpolishness and the infuriating raft section. Did I mention how I hated that part yet? Seriously, it is beyond terrible.\n\nOverall, 8/10, would heavily recommend.

Once i got passed that and into the game it looked crisp and well drawn, the voice actors are pretty bad but you don't get much after the first office section. A few phone calls to your boss and the funny "That's XX packs of batteries for the camera/torch"\n\nThere are enough batteries to fuel both the camera and the torch but it's often hard to know what to photograph, documents and clearly damaged areas but some things I snapped seemed to make no difference. Similarly some things I did in the game had no real purpose.\n\nThe game progressed nicely through woodland, into a dam then a logging factory then into a tunnel system. I rode an underground river on a raft that would capsize if it even brushed the rocky sides, that took a few tries to complete, mainly because I am an incompetant mariner :)\n\nA few scary moments like the roof collapsing and the fire in a later level but nothing too dramatic unless you are claustrophobic or like me, scared of heights. The tower section of the old steelworks was scarilly high and my bottom was twitching as I stumbled up the rickety iron steps with wind turbines alongside me and the ground a long way down. The view of the city though was astonishing from up there and talking about the steelworks, It was huge! The scope of the buildings is very believable, you really feel like you are inside an old factory.\n\nThe ending was slightly disappointing because it just stopped and the credits rolled but then it said, continued in Infra 2 so...have to wait to continue but will definately buy it.","March 26","true","15.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/251110/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Loiste Interactive: INFRA is the Steam debut for Loiste Interactive a small gaming development and self-publishing firm located in Finland. The game had humble beginnings as a Source Engine mod project  that eventually grew large enough to become its own fully fledged title.  The game drew a rabid fan base whilst it was in the Steam Greenlight program attracting more than 45,000 votes and peaking at #4 on the Greenlight Charts. It wasn’t until the developers understood just how popular their title was that they ultimately decided to create the company from that – until this point it was a group of friends who were working on their mod together. Soon thereafter thanks to some investment into the company the group were able to commit themselves to their project on a permanent full time basis.\n\nPre-Steam Release Acclaim: To show just how popular INFRA had become the game received a number of nominations and awards during its development cycle beginning in 2011 with selection to the top one hundred “Mod of the Year” list by ModDB, earning Greenlit status the following year on Steam and peaking with a nod from IndieDB as a top one hundred selection to “2014 Indie of the Year Awards.”\n\nA grand beginning: The first episode in the INFRA episodic adventure, part two will be free for purchasers of the first part, averages about ten hours in play. You play the role of a structural analyst whose tasked with the job of navigating, and hopefully surviving, a brutal labyrinth. As it says in the Steam Description, it is a gun-free puzzle adventure. Intelligence and strategy are awarded as you work your way through some of the most rewarding interactive puzzles to be seen in gaming in recent times. It’s an ambitious opening act that offers highly rewarding gameplay.\n\nLarge maps that truly inspire you to explore: Almost from the very beginning you will be surprised at just how large the maps in the game are. Although I found the office section to be more than a little tedious  – it’s main purpose  is to serve as a tutorial – I was surprised at just how large the area was. This continues right throughout the episode. They are all highly detailed featuring a number of different potential routes and offered a feeling of an open world better than some true open world games. Each area is filled with puzzles and unique game play that really does make you feel that you’re not repeating the same things over and over again. The game design has been very well thought out. The maps provide you ample opportunities to explore and to try different ideas with all of this feeling very rewarding. I quite enjoyed the distinct looks and sounds of the various areas. The environments are lush and beautiful. It genuinely feels as though Loiste Interactive thought of everything to create an immersive experience for the players.\n\nIt’s not perfect: There are a number of flaws in the game. However, I believe that this can be explained by the availability of resources for development and the relative inexperience of the development team. Overall, I believe that these flaws can be overlooked but they are notable. First, I was worried that I couldn’t even start the game. I don’t necessarily put games straight onto my SSD. Consequently, I put INFRA onto my HDD and it stayed there. When I first loaded up the game I got long periods of black screens to the point where I quit the game multiple times believing that the game had crashed on me. I believe on the third or fourth attempt I just said to hell with it and got myself a drink. I soon heard the game begin – so if this happens to you please wait. Secondly, the voice acting is poor. However, thankfully once you get out of the office there isn’t a lot of it and what little of it there is is bearable. That office seen, though, felt as though the voice actors didn’t particularly care for the job that they were doing. Not a good beginning. There are also grammatical errors in the English within the game but not to the point where you are dumbfounded at what is being said.\n\nINFRA is one of the best new Indie games on Steam. It offers significant gameplay value at its current cost and is perfect for those of you who enjoy good adventure puzzle games with some horror thrown in for good measure. If you don’t buy it now because you’re waiting for the second part of the game to be released then you should at the very least put it on your wishlist.\n\nFor similar reviews and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 22","true","13.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The puzzles themselves have a wide range, from the most simplistic, to rather challenging. The game itself looks great, the graphics and shaders really seemed to take effect to the game itself. There seems to have been a lot of work on everything on this game, from the stunning graphics and scenery to the puzzles.\n\nGame PlayThis game focuses mostly on puzzles, and have some puzzle-platforming parts of the game as well. It makes a nice change to the game rather than sticking to just puzzles all the time. Some of the puzzles that you may encounter in this game are either simplistic or rather difficult. The challenge of the game increases as you proceed through the game, the puzzles get harder and therefore require you to think more about how to solve them. The game starts at a slow pace in the way of solving puzzles, and the ouzzles seem to be one right after the other. The game itself isn't completely open world, but there is a decent amount of areas to explore if you are the kind of person who likes exploring places that aren't always 100% necessary to do so. A point that I didn't like about the rather difficult puzzles where the situations where you would just die over and over again until you can figure out what to do. This got me rather fustrated and made me stop playing for a small remainder of time. Thankfully this game has autosave checkpoints which slightly lowered my furstration when dying over and over but still pushed me enough to make me stop playing for a little bit. The story line of the game is really good, it's very interesting and made me come back to play more if I ever did break out of fustration at times of the game.\n\nGraphicsThe graphics of this game are absolutely stunning. I can't even begin to imagine how much work the developers must've put into this to make it look as good as it does. Although most of the game will be going into dark and gloomy places, there still seems to be a lot of work been put into this game. When you are platforming on the game, it gives you a chance to see more of the contryside that you couldn't normally see.\n\nMusic & SoundThe game really does well when it comes to the sounds when you are in the different locations of the game, depending if you are outside or inside a dark gloomy area, it really helps set the atmosphere up for the game. The sounds of the birds whistling when you are outdoors really makes it feel like a peaceful place to be in, along with the soundtrack which gives off a really nice ambient type of music (Deluxe edition).\n\nConclusionInfra is a very atmospheric and fun game to play. With it's vast amount of puzzles varied difficulty on some of the parts of the game, along with all of the sounds that you hear outside and in other places that set the atmosphere of thw game all togehter. Would recommend those of you who like puzzle games to definatly buy this!\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Good Games Giveaways & Reviews curator group here.","March 11","true","5.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bastwood/recommended/251110/","bastwood","Bastwood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bastwood/","689 products in account","I think "environmental puzzler" best describes Infra. As a structural analyst, you venture deep into the infrastructure of a city, gradually making your way through various factories, tunnels and facilities. Traversal problems are the main meat of the game - You need to figure out, repair and operate decrepit machinery to progress, pushing and turning dozens of buttons and valves.\n\nSome of the contraptions are rather complex, and combined with the fact that the levels in the game can get quite expansive, patience and perception are required. Be prepared to run around in circles every once in a while, since the game isn't in the habit of holding your hand at all.\n\nOther than your wits, nothing much else is required. There's absolutely no shooting or enemies of any kind, but you can easily die to a multitude of enrivonmental hazards. There are some sections that require precision jumping and swift actions, but they are relatively far and between. For the most part, you can take as long as you want to explore.\n\nSome of the industrial levels are quite good-looking especially considering that the game is running on Source, but Infra definitely doesn't put its best foot forward and the game begins by bombarding the player with some extremely dubious character models and seriously weak voice acting. Fortunately these are the only attempts at human interaction you'll have to endure during the playthrough, and things quickly get into the groove once you're alone in the rural areas.\n\nI was pleasanly suprised by the length of the game and the toughness of the puzzles - Infra took me nearly ten hours, which is a lot considering the low price of the game. You'll have to look past a lot of rough edges though; The game crashed on multiple occasions, and I even had to momentarily swap into windowed mode to get past a particularly nasty level-loading crash. More than that, there are a few map glitches that forced me to revert to a previous checkpoint because I got hopelessly stuck. Oh, and the achievements seem to work very sporadically.\n\nAnyhow, despite of its shortcomings, I enjoyed my time with Infra a lot. The environments of the game tell a way better story than the various memos sprinkled around, and there's a promise of Part Two coming in the future. I'll play that one as well for sure.","January 17","true","9.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Seriously, it would feel so much less like a walking simulator and be so much more enjoyable if the devs took less than a day to make a better one. It confuses my why they don't do this because they aren't exactly lazy. I either have to turn my DPI up to insane levels or it's just too cringy to play...\nPuzzles are certaintly not the best but certaintly not a dealbreaker, I don't expect this to be the new Talos Principle.\nThe devs spent too much time on the graphics and not enough time on mechanics and practically everything else. As a game developer it's important to balance everything. Here, they made the graphics way too good for a game of this class, decreasing the quality of everything else.\nThe story is annoying because forming monopolies or trusts is illegal in almost every country. If it was placed in the times of people like Rockefeller or Carnegie where monopolies were more powerful than the president it would have been really cool.\n\nThis game has(or had) a lot of potential to be something truely unique, but at this stage it's just not feasible to give it the overhaul it needs. It's a shame to see such good ideas wasted on poor execution. Unless your absolutely dying for a puzzle game and you have litteraly played them all I really couldn't recommend this to you...","June 2","false","6.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Go ahead and survive"\n\nIntroductionI love graphic adventures, especially those who makes you think what's going on. There's a scent of danger here and you need to solve what's going on in that old facility. A great game with a great display and visuals. The puzzles are really difficult, maybe not all of them but get away of the danger, and don't forget your job, take those pics for the boss.\n\nGameplayIt's quite easy. Go to your office and forget those boring morning debriefs. You have a work to do. Take the camera, flashlights and all things you gonna need in an old facility to solve the mystery. And the puzzles. You are a structural analyst, in the middle of a routine mission but things get complicated. I promise.\n\nDon't forget to pick up for batteries! You gonna need for the camera and don't use it a lot. If you enter a place just use it once, take the picture if you need and turn it off, just to save batteries, and the flashlight. You will listen a sound when the appropriate picture is taken, take that into account.\n\nHere the puzzles are very logic so think. Use your head, that gonna help you to continue your mission. Use your eyes too, there are keys or objects you gonna need to use. Don't forget to visit every corner of the "map". I always do that, you never know what to find.\n\nWe can forget about the music here, except in the car radio. In real life, we don't have music everywhere. But the ambience sounds are amazing, the birds, the wind, everything. Also, the voice interpretations are just great.\n\nPros+ Very realistic adventure\n+ Great sound effect\n+ Intelligent puzzles\n+ Great visual and display\n+ Good story\n\nCons- Sometimes you can feel frustrated if you don't pass the puzzle\n- No gamma corrector. Adding one would be interesting.\n\nFinal ThoughtsThis is an amazing game with a lot of puzzles, realistic ones you have to solve. I really recommend this game if you like that mix of a good graphic adventure, logic puzzles, and survival. Ah, don't forget the batteries.\n\nRating:8.5/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.","March 22","true","5.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Especially the part where u have to turn on/off pipes.\nThe game is feeling amazing and its so chilling , while you go through every mystery. All the abonbaned houses, stations , roads and tunnels hide new secrets behind them.\n\nProblems\nThe optimization... It sucks to be honnest. Yes , i got old and kinda useless for todays game PC , but i run all the source games with over 45 to 100 fps. This is game made with source engine. After chapter 4 i cant even complete the game , because its totally unplayable. However from chapter 1 to chapter 4 i had around 50 fps and on chapter 5 i got maximum of 15fps.\n\nOverall\nEven after that\nI higly recommend this game. They give u ~13+hrs of gameplay , great story , great graphics , level design and athmosphere. Also they are developing part 2 which is going to be free for everyone who bought the game.\n\n9/10 Great game , bad optimization.","May 6","true","7.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I thought it was all there is, but this game gave me a pleasant surprise. This game was more than just a "walking simulator", it offered much more with fun puzzles for everyone to enjoy. It's like Myst taken out of the island into an ordinary office and adding in some exploration element, similar to The Disappearance of Ethan Carter. This game captures you into that same atmosphere and will have you stopping from time to time to admire the sceneries around you, taking "stop and smell the roses" a whole new level.\n\nIt's one of those games that allows you to sit and enjoy it on a Sunday afternoon, after a day of hardwork.","May 1","true","5.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The levels are big and there is a lot to explore. Yet the game feels unfinished. Most of the time you don't know what you are doing and where you are going, which could be ok if you would get rewarded (which you don't) for wandering around and checking every corner like in other exploration games.\n\nThe voice acting was horrible, especially on the part of the main character. With the given voice of our hero, the letter a in the flashlight sounds more like an e, which then again might be humorous... The game was doing it's best to be funny, but managed to do this in quite a childish way. Most non-Finnish people won't probably find the ever-present beer references amusing.\n\nThe game has some climbing and jumping elements, for which the character movement isn't very well suited. Especially the part requiring jumping or other athletics were frustrating as our hero can't really do these things. When this was couple insta-death situations (dropping to water etc.) or running against time situations, it wasn't really enjoyable. Is this poor map design, a challenge or did I miss some important controls when I would always end up in the river when taking what seemed to be a short cut?\n\nAs for the puzzles and the story, well, I lost interest in them. The puzzles became something I had to do in order to open a door to continue and I couldn't get any joy out of that after a while. Something was missing to keep me interested and motivated, something didn't make the world believable. Still, I managed to complete the game, though I could have just as easily given up after losing interest.\n\nWhile investigating the problems of the infrastructure and corruption behind it seemed like a nice idea, it felt like a bad hobby (because of not getting anything in return, just to advance to next location). There was no benefit in doing it. Also there is some illogical aspect in this, a hole in the bridge or a wall should be reported but blocked fire escapes and other clear structural defect and dangerous things shouldn't be? I really couldn't understand sometimes what I was supposed to document and what not.\n\nSo, who should buy this game? If you like exploring and solving puzzles, maybe this is your game. The idea had novelty value, but somehow the end result didn't feel like a ready game. So maybe instead of part 2, this part 1 should be finished?","February 27","false","6.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Also the voice acting is some of the worst I have ever suffered through, it's like The Room level acting, and the characters are not even in sync, someone would often start talking before the last person had finished the sentence.

Yet the concept of walking through dilapadated ruins looking for dangerous cracks and things out of place sucked me in, and I'm very glad it did! Having played through Part 1 (Part 2 is due later and will not be DLC but an integral part of the game, which will rise in price when it is released, so buying now may save you!) I would say that my favourite part of INFRA is the incredible atmosphere the game manages to create. An effective mix of impressive visuals and ambient effects bring to life the game's juxtaposition of the natural and artificial landscapes - so you'll emerge from a tunnel to see the decaying entrace behind is encrusted in trees and plants just as a slightly haunting tune plays, giving a pleasantly melancholy feeling.\n\nThe game puzzles are nice and varied, with clever use of the same elements to prevent everything from feeling too 'samey'. The game plot appears threadbare at first, but as the game progresses you can find out a lot more - nothing is presented explicitly, but if you piece together the scattered documents you find along the game you can put it all together, culminating in the final setpiece which sets the game up nicely for Part 2. The game has pretty good replay value, with a good mix of hidden achievements and collectibles (e.g. when going off the game path to some inaccessible place you'll sometimes find a geocache). After finishing my first playthrough I really want to go through again and find every little detail! Overall, INFRA is a steal for its price - I'd thoroughly recommend it\n\n","March 28","true","32.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its 7/8 m8\n\nEDIT, M8!!!\nI tried playing this after giving up because the puzzles are too damn hard and I find out that my save is corrupted. There are giant textures covering everything interactable with. It's a flat orange texture that says trigger on it. I am also at a part in the Stalburg Water place where you have to put in a code to disable an alarm and the code is 1986 (I had to look this up because the window the code is in is opaque white). The buttons I have to put the code into are under a flat black surface so I have to guess which ones to press. I figured out where 8 was and it would not select the number so I cannot finish th game.\n\nEDIT #2!!! :D I found out how to fix the glitch!!! I had to restart the chapter! :)","January 17","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game seems to have not been playtested with people coming into the game completely blind.\n\n- Distractingly amateurish voice acting\n- Sluggish controls\n- No adjusting options when inside the game. Why?!\n- Long loading times\n- Many levels have dead end sections of no importance\n- Valves turn agonizingly slowly, and there are plenty of them\n- Some key items are easily missable, or even hidden to an extent\n- Some sections seem instantly deadly, but they actually aren't and you need to enter them\n- Time critical sections are extremely confusing, needing many restarts\n- A completely pointless rafting section\n\nIf I'd have to sum up INFRA in one word, it would be confusion. Most of my almost 9 hours of playtime was spent backtracking, trying to search every corner for something to interact with or take with me, staring at panels and walls for numbers, trying a route and dying, only to figure out that the last save was 5 minutes ago, retrying a solution only to fail because of the controls, figuring out there's a path that has been deadly in other instances, but now all of a sudden it's safe to traverse etc.\n\nGames like Portal and Braid can have moments of simply staring at the puzzle, but in those situations you know what the goal is, and thinking about the problem takes you closer to the solution. In INFRA, there were plenty of times where I had no idea what I was supposed to do or where I was supposed to go. Many of the puzzles in INFRA take the form of overly complicated machinery that needs certain switches and buttons in certain positions, or certain pipes need to be either opened or closed via slowly turning valves somewhere, or sometimes you need to find the valve itself somewhere and find where to stick that valve. The same puzzle types get very old very quickly.\n\nIt's kind of sad to write this kind of review, as INFRA was one of the first games I witnessed in Steam Greenlight, and it seemed like a fresh idea with plenty of potential. Now INFRA seems more like a TC mod for Half-Life 2 rather than a fully fledged game in it's own right.\n\nHere's to hoping that part 2 will be better.","May 28","false","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
