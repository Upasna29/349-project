He is talented...\nWith a tutorial, this game could do more than just one nomination.\nI played using an xbox controller","November 13, 2015","true","2.5"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","17","18","4","3"

I have failed as of yet to not enter a histarical laughing fit when a small army of ghost dudes are inexplicably blown up by a bomb that was placed three rounds back.\n\nThe number of times I've been killed by someone from a past round because they "out played me" is delightfully rage inducing. I don't think I've ever been so mad and laughed at the same time.\n\nGet it, play it on the couch with your friends (or hamster minions).","November 25, 2015","true","1.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Great for first timers.\n\nMage:  Class cannon style.  My favorite.\n\nBuilder:  Reminds me of Minecraft + TF2.\n\nBUG:  In the tutorial you can map the same button for multiple actions.  But easy enough to figure through.  Should be fixed though.\n\nBONUS:  The tutorial shows an old school NES controller.  It helps you figure out how to navigate, what to do, etc.  Thumbs up for old school retro style!\n\nI won this game (and 3 others) on a give-away.  Glad I did, this game looks great!","December 29, 2015","true","1.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

There's nothing like it out there, or at least nothing quite as refined. If you're a fan of local multiplayer or time shenanigans, get this game.","January 14","true","0.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Game looks BEAUTIFUL!\n\nQuick suggestion?  You should make the intro/tutorial skippable.  The part where it shows classes/etc.  I started to rage when I couldn't skip it.  It takes forever!!\n\nWhat the heck Second time I am playing it, it is stuck on the controller menu asking me to keep on hitting controls but I cant figure out how to continue, help!","May 20","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I mostly played the single player challenge mode as I didn't have any friends to play with.\n\nMoving slow moving characters around the screen to hit stationary targets is really not very exciting.  It also takes forever to restart when you fail just adding to the frustration.  This game is really punishing right from the beginning, and not in a fun way.  I dont mind being thrown in the deep end but this is a bit much.\n\nAlso what's with T and Y being the default action keys?\n\nProbably more fun in multiplayer.","November 18, 2015","false","0.8"," 5 of 18 people (28%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","28","5","18","2","2"

The time travel mechanic is cool but lacks strategic depth.\n\nWorth a try but not a buy at the moment.
