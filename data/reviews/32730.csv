It was released in 1999, so the graphics are obviously low quality compared to new titles, but they are on-par with other flight simulation games at that time. As far as flight simulators go, this game is more action oriented than the true-to-life flight dynamics one might find in X-Plane or Microsoft Flight Simulator.\n\nThe first several Quick Missions work you through a tutorial on the game basics and the last training mission is a full combat mission test. The Quick Missions also have a large and variable assortment of non-arc combat missions to help hone your skills for campaign mode.\n\nThe campaign mode has a large number of single player missions. You work you way through various deployment campaigns and the mission situations build-up to a finale mission for each campaign (typically culminating to a nuclear strike or combination bombing/multiple enemy squadron mission). It also tracks your stats and has a scoring and flight rank promotion system based on your mission performance. Each finished campaign rewards a medal to the pilot as well.\n\nThere is multiplayer available, but only through a community-based mod. The game originally shipped with built-in multiplayer, but since this game is nearly 15 years old, the built-in, Novalogic-based multiplayer system no longer functions.\n\nMy biggest complaint is the default keyboard map is not very intuitive and the tutorial could be more in-depth. Despite the game's age, my Saitek X-52 joystick and throttle work fine with no modifications (all basic flight controls work, including firing active weapon, rudder, and throttle functionality).\n\nIf you are feeling nostalgic and enjoy flight simulators or air combat games, this one still has depth and fun available after 15 years. Despite another reviewer's issues, I have had zero crashes while doing anything in this game and have not had to modify any game files for it to function properly (I'm in 64-bit Windows 7 with a DX11 GPU and Core i7 CPU).","March 14, 2014","true","24.2"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OverheadV8/recommended/32730/","OverheadV8","Hammy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OverheadV8/","106 products in account","Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Pratt & Whitney proudly present, the F-22 Raptor Air Superiority Fighter! In cooperating cutting edge avionics, weapon systems and stealth technology, the F-22 promises to be the air dominance fighter for the 21st century. The Westinghouse AN/APG-77 radar with it's one hundred-twenty degree field of view enables the Raptor to acquire and track multiple targets beyond visual range. It's on-board computer system can identify and classify targets at a rate of seven hundred million instructions per second, the equivalent of four super computers.\n\nProviding power for the F-22 are two Pratt & Whitney F119 turbofan engines. Rated at thirty-five thousand pounds of thrust each, the engines allow the Raptor to supercruise at MACH 1.58 without the use of afterburners, greatly reducing the F-22's heat signature. The F119's engines also feature a two-dimensional thrust vectoring system giving the Raptor superior agility in combat.\n\nIn it's air superiority role, the Raptor carries two AIM-9X SIDEWINDER's and six AIM-120C AMRAAM's. For deep strike missions, four AMRAAM's can be replaced with two one thousand pound Joint Direct Attack Munitions. The JDAM is a GPS guided "smart bomb" which can strike at target without active lasing allowing the F-22 to remain undetected.\n\nDesigned with stealth as a primary goal, the F-22's titanium and composit superstructure is both lightweight and strong. With the addition of radar absorbing materials, the frontal radar cross section is over one hundred times smaller than on the F-15C.\n\nThe rules of war have changed, the battles of tomorrow will be won not by those with the largest armies, but by those who can attack without being seen. The only armor will be the cloak of invisibility. Achieving air superiority will be the task of the only aircraft capable of striking at the heart of the enemy. It is a warplane light years ahead in it's design, a supersonic killing machine.\n\nThe F-22 RAPTOR!\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nThat goes for the Raptor, and now let's continue with the game review.\n\nThe people at NOVALOGIC are known of making a lot of great war games. As an owner of multiple Novalogic titles in the past, one thing in common with all of them is NL's own handprint which can be seen and felt in-game. Basically this means you know what you're getting for your buck. A game which is a military simulator in lighter category, but still contains balance of realism and fun at the same time. Simplified, but always well made and written voice-over tutorials to help all new players settling in easier. Also I have to mention those small showcases with short educational facts are nice goodies.\n\n\nFlying & navigating\n\nI find this game to be very enjoyable despite it's easy flight modeling. As far as I understand this is not far from truth, because in real life this particular warplane just like the new F-35 (which is under development right now) uses a lot of computer assistance to make flying and the use of instruments for the pilot a lot more pleasant and easier. In practice this means your aircraft will try to maintain the angle you're heading regardless of your AoA or how much thrust you use. This also means you don't have to worry about declining, because unlike with many other warplanes depending on the load you carry, they do require constant manual rudder / pitch adjusting in order to maintain level flight.\n\nAvionics & weapon systems\n\nAs you might already get an idea here, this plane is incredibly smart, it is even smarter than you! You can even go grab a drink and have a smile while the autopilot does the landing for you. You don't have to measure distances or do manual target identification either, you can just cycle through your targets on the radar easily with a press of a button while the F-22's computer gives you the intel of enemy type / AoA. After you find a target, next thing you do is select your armament, wait a bit for the target reticle to turn red and fire! You literally have always advantage over the enemy because of your advanced avionics, stealth and long range missiles. The F-22's missiles are all literally "fire-and-forget" type, so none of them require further guidance after you launch them.\n\nIf this fighter is so advanced, is there any actual challenge at all?\n\nUnfortunately all NL's flight series seems to share the same stupid AI which can be annoying and buggy sometimes. I played the original F-22 Lightning II back in 1996 and F-22 Raptor (1998), and the way AI controls the planes in this game is identical. A lot of time the enemy planes act like they're braindead, so the chances for the AI to even try doing anything is 50/50. Most of the time when they're flying towards you and you engage them first, they just sit there and wait for your missile to hit them instead of making any evasive maneuvers. Also the AI doesn't have any sort of ground collision, and sometimes you can actually see them cheat by flying through mountains or go underground making them impossible to shoot down. If it's a mission goal target doing this crap you might have to restart the mission because of that as the F-22 cannot fly into the void under the map, lol. I also have to mention the way missiles act, it's not very good. All the missile trajectories are wrong because they don't try to predict where the target is heading, so instead they're aiming directly on the target itself (usually trail). This leads for the missile to miss the target a lot if it's being fired from a bad angle. As an example if the enemy is moving horizontally and the missile cannot get behind the target anywhere between 8 'o clock - 4 'o clock it can never hit it's goal. Even if the target is heading the same direction as you but with high altitude it wont hit. A lot of times some missions are challenging only because the enemy is approaching from a bad angle for your missiles to hit, so you need to cut in front of their flight path and reorient yourself before you can engage them. This can be frustrating especially with all the escort type missions, because some of them can require some tricky planning.\n\nWhen it comes to dedication and maintaining some standard, I think Novalogic does it's job well. Despite L3's small bugs, it's still a very rewarding and entertaining game to play. If you always wanted to pilot an F-22, this is the game for you to start with.","June 15, 2015","true","8.9"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

The controls aren't intuitive as much as F-16. No tutorial / training mode can be found in the game! Like F-16, this game do support the XBOX 360 gamepad to a point but you would be better of playing this game with Keyboard though. The gameplay is slow and bland/boring. The audio (sound/music) aren't that great either. Also, don't seek out this game for the multiplayer as it is quite dead! Maybe you could play in LAN but I haven't nor I am willing to give it a shot! Did this game improved at all from F-16 Multirole Fighter? Barely! The visuals are a tad better but that would be all.\n\nPROS:\n+Works on modern computers (although it kept crashing until I ran the game in Windows XP compatibility). Also, XBOX 360 gamepad is supported, but barely, like F-16.\n+Improved visuals from F-16.\n+Simulation seems adequate from what I played, cockpit is well modelized.\n\nCONS:\n-Dated visuals, graphics compared to modern gaming.\n-Game doesn't completely support full screen as you see the window.\n-Controls aren't very intuitive. Same controls as F-16.\n-No tutorial / training mode so you are left out figuring the controls for yourself.\n-Boring gameplay.\n-Poor audio (sounds and music).\n-While in-game, can't access the options menu nor view/edit the controls which that is quite unacceptable in my book.\n-Dead Multiplayer (to be expected though).\n\nOVERALL:\nWell, barely any improvement from F-16 and well, I would only advise you modern games instead. I'm not sure how this game did back in 1999 but now in 2014, I prefer investing time on more modern games, as should you!\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nI would recommend F-22 Lightning 3 to flight simulation purists and gamers that dig old school gaming only. But in my book, you should stay away and look into modern games instead!\n\nAlso, since you cannot buy a single Novalogic classic and "forced" to buy the Novalogic Classics Volume One: Machines of War package, you better think twice before investing in this as I only found one game worth of purchase, Commanche 4. If you can find this package on a very good and drastic deal, give it a shot. Better, look somewhere else if you can buy a single game at a time.\n\nRATING:\n3.0 / 10","January 4, 2014","false","0.1"," 3 of 27 people (11%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","11","3","27","3","0"
