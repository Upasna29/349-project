Graphically speaking, it’s beautiful. The effects look flattering. The models are spectacular. At the time of writing this review, there're not that many buildings to be built at all. Just some basics. Long range unit brewer, short range brewer, defense systems, etc. The combat, however, is very fun. With many abilities to choose from, it is not easy to be disappointed. You can be a living dragon type creature (not flying, though), a fire-breathing one, too! I could see how this game could be described as a 4K dream in the future since I have been able to play some very action-packed battles with stable frames ranging from 45-60. It’s definitely worth picking up during a sale, heck, get a few for you and your friends. It’s a blast to play. I once missed 20 minutes on one battle, it just flew away. Time well spent!\n\nGameplay\nThe controls are difficult to remember for the first few times you’ll be playing a match. Otherwise, the game is solid. The mechanics work fluidly together. Playing with or against AI is actually quite of a challenge. You can choose from a decent pool of maps. Battles can go on for quite some time. It’s just a very good and difficult strategy game, to be honest. Just the FPS mechanics that make it truly special. It really, really reminds me of Airmech (an amazing F2P game on Steam, you should check it out). Both games are amazing, so try out Airmech as a “try before you buy” type deal, you’ll most likely stay playing both Warshift and Airmech.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nPros:\nLong battles\nTons of potential\nAwesome work for only one developer\nRPG mechanics\nBig map pool\nSmart AI\n\nCons:\nBuggy\nNot many characters to play around as\nShort supply of buildings in the game\n\nI have been gifted the key by the kind developers of the game. They make my review about games like this possible.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

Craziest thing is that it is made by just one developer!!! You can tell that that this is one guys dream game that he made himself. The units are simple yet perfectly chosen (infantry type, missle laucher/vehicle type, mechwarior type and even a dreadnaught/full starship!!!).

On board the ARK (assault ship), you will telepathically command an army of cyborg guards, droids and heavy Machinery, and mount your counter attack against the invaders.\n\nWarshift is a very interesting game, merging RTS and 3rd person action games. At the start of each mission, you will be briefed on your objectives via a video, then you will be in the ARK hangar and you will be presented with your combat avatar (the unit that you will control when you jump to the 3rd person view) and have the opportunity to add weapons and upgrades.\n\nFor the gameplay aspect, you will have to build structures to drill resources, AI cyborgs base, AI vehicle base and gun platforms to defend the ARK and other structures. Every 60 seconds, new units will appear from the relevant base (if built) automatically. At any given time you can swap from a RTS gameplay to a 3rd person and take command of your combat avatar. If you are like me, it will take you a while to get used to it and it can be frustrating at time.\n\nThe current version of WARSHIFT has a campaign mode with 10 missions, a Skirmish and multiplayer mode. The graphics are really good and the game runs well. In terms of the controls, for the 3rd person point of view it is fine but I feel the camera when you play RTS aspect needs to be better (need to be faster when zooming in and out).\nI am very impressed by the fact that this project has being developed by only one person!\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Good synergy concept\n-	Good and polished graphics\n-	Intriguing gameplay\n-	Runs well\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	A tad difficult to master and can become frustrating\n-	No achievements at this stage\n-	No trading cards at this stage\n\nThis game has great potential, have a look at it!\n\n7/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

I got absolutely destroyed in ym first 3 games, so I looked around and found a difficulty setting in the main menu options and turned it down to easy.\n\nThe ability to endlessly zoom in and out with the scrollwheel is something I've wanted in pretty much every RTS game I've ever played, so I love that. You hit "Tab" to zoom down into 3rd person (and then a right click will zoom you into a scoped 1st person" view, and it happens instantly, which is fantastic.\n\nThere are some jarring moments when your hero unit dies and the game flashes your view into rts view and zoomed into a random part of the map below your hq, which is weird, but stuff like that I assume will get fixed over time.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are well on their way, it just needs some UI love.\n\nTons of potential with a clearly dedicated developer. It just needs time. It's so much more ambitious than a lot of games that it deserves a real chance.","August 16, 2015","true","1.1"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","0"

This game implements the RPG Elements and FPS mode with one of its most important gameplay mechanics; Avatars.\n\nAn Avatar, on the Republic side, is a mechanised drone controlled by the commander (you) and offers a massive strategic advantage, to the point of being overpowered, giving you the ability to transform to either walk/drive, fly or submerge into the ocean. An Avatar can also hold four upgrades and five weapons. In my opinion, the upgrades system is gimmicky and as much as I know how to use it, it still seems like it can be improved. I have several suggestions on how the game can be improved but I know it's in Early Access and I can't wait for more content to be created by the one man developer, Cyril Megem. I am impressed but not surprised that this game is under development by a solo developer and as I'm hoping to aspire to the same level, I congratulate him on his achievements.\n\nThe story behind this game is, at the moment, quite bare, it only explains that Aliens, non-material beings, coming from the 'Gates of Chaos' can manipulate and control exoskeletons so they can impact the environment to their will. With this story, it makes two factions; the Alien Invaders and the Colonial Republic. Only having two factions doesn't offer much diversity but, again, I understand why this isn't possible as of yet; the developer, who is a graphic artist, game designer and programmer has to focus on developing the game, rather than expanding outwards just yet.\n\nAs far as the Real Time Strategy part of the game goes, it is very lackluster in my opinion, only having four maps, ten campaign missions and barely any units and buildings but I can understand why it may be lacking in these departments. Some of the missions objectives, at the start, weren't very clear and it's hard to get into at first. But once I did, after I finished the campaign at the highest difficulty, I just wanted more. The five hours I've already played have been nothing but pure enjoyment and I can see the potential this game has.\n\nThis game works very well on my Intel Core i3 computer, maintaining a very stable framerate at low quality settings because of my outdated graphics card. There is the occasional split-second freeze if there is a lot of pressure on my system but besides this, it should work very well on most, if not, all computers. The graphics are beautifully rendered but the engine and control could be optimised. The camera for the Raider Avatar was quite realistic but was no doubt, quite annoying, having to move my mouse back and fourth to get the right aim and lead to my death more than it should have.\n\nLooking back on the game, to me, it was money very well spent and I'm glad to have shown my support. I can understand why some people might not be able to get into this game but for die-hard RTS and Action game fans, this is definitely a game to consider. I did not regret buying this game one bit and it was well worth it for me.\n\nPros:\n- Great, consistent graphics\n- Innovative game concept\n- Avatars offer a lot in strategy and offer more immersion\n\nCons:\n- Somewhat limiting controls\n- LAN-Only Multiplayer\n- Lack of units, buildings, factions, lore, maps, campaign missions and objectives\n- Even at the highest difficulty, skirmish and campaign missions don't provide a challenge\n\nOverall, to give this game a rating out of 10, I'd give it an 8 as of yet. I really enjoyed Warshift.","December 25, 2015","true","45.7"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","0"

The second and third players on each team focus entirely on their combat avatars, and play a third-person action game where they can turn the tide of battle, and are required to activate energy points so that the commanders can place more buildings.\n\nThink of it as an action MOBA where you have a lot more control over the buildings and units on the battlefield.

For example, you can't build a tonne of different types of units and upgrading them multiple times like in other strategy games. However, the game makes up for that with the ability to directly control one of your units. You can choose between a handful of units to control, which all play differently. These units have unique weapons, and have different abilities. These controllable units can also be upgraded.\n\nThe maps are pretty cool, with a decent variety. You also have the ability to customize all sorts of traits such as the weather, and where everyones units spawn on the map in a skirmish mode.\n\nThere's also a campaign which gives you a set battlefield depending on what mission you choose, and certain objectives to complete.\n\nIt's a nice breath of fresh air to the strategy genre that I personally feel has become a bit stale over time.

Sadly that means there will be a need for a "critical mass" in the community's numbers to actually have the chance to find open games to challenge people who aren't on your friends'list yet. This means this game will depend very much on how many players are online willing to play it at anytime (or at least at the times you wanna play it).\n\nGraphically it is pretty nice, although the units/alien design may not be everyone's cup of tea. The game itself is a mix of RTS, MOBA and vehicular FPS mechanics and may involve a lot of switching mode and micromanagement depending on your strategy (although I am pretty sure successful ones will involves indeed giving orders to various groups of specialized units (i.e. heavy artillery, dreadnoughts, bombers etc.) and switching back and forth to direct control of your commander unit).\n\nI regret that the controls reassignement settings do not support mouse button 4, 5 etc. though. :)\n\nStill great potential and again may shine when played with friends or random human players in both coop or pvp.

This game while still a work in progress already has an insane amount of potential, for those unfamiliar with the concept of gameplay. It is an Action RTS which means you can go down on the battlefied and fight as a tank/soldier/plane/spaceshitp (in the current version only one vehicle playable per faction) You can also build bases command units and seemlessly swap between the two. While the execution is very different from games like "Battle Zone" or "Sacrifice" the ability to lead your troops and fight a long side them is unfortunately rare. The is visaully stunning, animations are fluid and believable. Sound track/ sound deign is very good. Has a campaign and skirmish mode. They are working to bring servers online for the multiplayer, for now its LogMeinHamachi for me (Port forwarding) My only beef with this game thus far is the Space Battles are a bit unrealistic as far as Asteriod movements and planet Rotation speeds are concerned.

To keep the player seated in their hero unit, infantry and vehicle production buildings are 100% automated. Take note that this really doesn't make the RTS aspect any easier, since you'll also need to turn the tide with your personal vehicle as well as build air units from your spawn point since you can't be everywhere at once. My main gripe is that the AI is nothing short of brutal even on easy (though i dunno if that has to do with my personal skill with RTS, so if anyone else owns this game, I'd like to know that it isn't just me.)\n\nGraphics\nPersonally, I cannot help but note that everyone loves to hate Unity because of this aspect, but I'd like to think that i'm not lying when I say that this game looks gorgeous and I'd go as far as to say that it'll take a long time until Unity games look as good as this. My primary dislike in this regard is the lack of advanced visual options.\n\nOther\nLooking at both the gameplay and the graphics, you can imagine how surprised I am to realize that this is completely done by one person. While I believe that Shigeru Miyamoto's philosophy about rushing games applies to WARSHIFT, I'm hoping that the money I give to Cyril Megem will go towards eventually finding likeminded developers who will help with the completion of this product.\n\nSuggestions\nOne thing which i think would help the game a lot is to give co-op players the ability to ping the host over the minimap and/or allow them to enter the RTS view. As it currently stands, there is no hotkey to signal the host whenever co-op players free up power supplies.","February 11","true","6.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

You can seamlessly swap between piloting a dinosaur-shaped drone  and an overhead commander's perspective where you manage resources and build structures and units to support your Avatar drone like turrets, infantry, tanks, and aircraft.  Your Avatar drone is an upgradeable mech that can transform from walker to VTOL aircraft to submarine. There's also an alien/badguy faction I haven't tried yet but they look pretty badass as well.  There appears to be a pretty nice little campaign-mode, as well as player-vs-AI skirmishes and both PvP and Co-Op multiplayer.  This game has a lot more going on than what I've already mentioned (as I've only dipped my toes in it thus far), and I highly recommend anyone looking for something fun and different (and don't mind some kinks that will hopefully be worked out upon official release) to give a shot!","April 24","true","1.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game takes what I consider to be a very decent crack at blending three genres together. The presentation is excellent and the menu screens and art are reminiscent of old RTS classics like StarCraft and Command and Conquer.\n\nWhat I like most about the game is that it's a solid RTS at heart. There was a lot of room to go wrong here, but the developer did an excellent job of getting this part right. You have your main base for buildings, buildings for units, and of course resource gathering.\n\nThe unique aspect of this game is the first person mode. It is very well done with solid controls, multiple characters (or avatars) to choose from, and weapon upgrades for each. Some of these felt a bit like copies of each other at the beginning but, with recent additions, it is clear the developer wants to add variety. For example, two of the 4 avatars I've played with both go under water and fly. This made them seem too similar. The other two avatars have different abilities like being able to use stealth/melee and actually carrying other units. This is a step in the right direction, but I don't think it's quite there yet. Despite this, being able to jump in the fight with your units and tip the scales in your favor due to a well placed missile attack does give you a sense of satisfaction that you don't get to enjoy with just a regular RTS.\n\nThough many would see the controls as "clunky", I actually don't count them as a con. There is certainly a learning curve, but it's nothing near impossible. The biggest con for me is the MOBA approach. The maps are varied and don't get old, but at the end of the day you're on one end and your enemy is on the other. It removes that sense of mystery and surprise you get when clearing out the "fog of war"  to discover that your enemy has been at your door the whole time, or that you have just hit the mother load in resources. The MOBA approach does level the playing field for multiplayer, but it just doesn't keep me interested in the campaign mode.\n\nAll in all, this is an good game that can only get better. I bought this during a Steam special and couldn't be happier. The graphics are excellent, I haven't found any really bad bugs (so far), the gameplay is challenging but fun, and it's constantly being updted. Take into account that this was all done by one guy (Cyril Megem), and you can see that what you're purchasing is a well crafted experience by a person with a LARGE amount of attention to detail.","May 4","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game still presents a very limited amount of characters and buildings spread unevenly across just two factions/teams as well as a mere 5 maps to play in. Also, expect a bunch of bugs during your playthrough, as the game clearly still lacks some polish. But as the developers don't seem like the lazy type, again, I find that I'm able to recommend this game to anyone who wants to get to experience it in early access.","April 28","true","0.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's got an awesome concept and so far a good application. Definitely a game to keep an eye out for.\n\n============================Pointless exposition!=========================================\nOne of my favourite genres in gaming from a young age has been the mighty RTS genre. RTSs have always been my go to game from my thousands of hours of Age Of Empires (I logged hundreds into the computer demo alone >_<) to games like Halo Wars on the Xbox 360 and the mighty Starcraft, it's always been a genre that's been solid to me.\nThroughout my ventures through the RTS library, there's always been something that I've wanted to do. There's always been hero characters in these games, and well... I've always wanted to take direct control of a character and fight along side my men while we battle against the enemy. It's always been somthing that I thought should be found in there games, but never did I come across it, until now.\n===================================================================================\n\nWarShift brings in the concept of fighting along side your men while you lay seige to the enemy and pulls it off quite well I must say. The game revolves around this gimmic and applies it fantastically, with a transition that feels natural and works quite well.\nThe game has decent visuals and the layout of the terrain excellently brings this unique concept out extremely well.\n\nSadly, this game has quite a few draw backs. It's hard to play. It doesn't really explain itself well. It lacks the polish to push it over the edge to the point where I'd go around to my friends, telling them to buy it. It's not bad by any stretch, just lacking and needs a lot more work. I really truly hope the developer puts in that effort, I want to see this game get to that place.\nI know this game can get to that point and I'm really looking forward to it.\n\nThere is one more thing I want to pick at before I finish. The game's RTS to Third person mechanic doesn't quite feel like one game. It's really cool, but the gameplay as of yet feels like you're either playing a Third Person shooter or an RTS. It's pretty much at the point where you're better off just to go destroying the enemy's ARC yourself and just respawning a bunch of times. Though, that's a problem I may have due to lack of experience with the game.\n\nThis game if definitely cool in concept and so far is working well in practce. I'd say if you're as into the RTS genre as I am, then give it a buy and support the dream mashup.\nWhat I do really want to see come out of this game is Co-op. I feel like that's be amazing.","December 27, 2015","true","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I wanted to make a third person action game!"\n"Whatever it is, it needs transforming mechs..."\n\nAnd the lead designer just looked all of them in the eyes and said... "Yes."\n\nThat leaves us with Warshift, a game that really can't make up it's mind which genre it represents, but it doesn't seem to care.\n\nI'm not going to make excuses here, it's a weird game. For the most part, levels are set up in MOBA fashion, where your objective is to take out the enemy base directly across from you on the map, mostly by crushing it under hordes of minions.\nHowever, the game doesn't just hand you the infrastructure to build all those minions. You have to build all that yourself.\n\nThis is where the RTS part kicks in. You get to choose where you place your buildings that "spawn" troops to go fight, which troops to spawn, and where to place turrets, resource mines, etc.\n\nSo where's that 3rd Person shooter/action game come in? Well, at any time you can hit tab to pop into the driver seat of your own upgradable "avatar" unit. Take it out for a spin, blow up some baddies! Carry a lane up to the enemy base!\n\nThe core and mechanics of the game are pretty solid, and a lot of fun. They could still use a little tweaking, but there's a gem in this rough.\nThere's also multiplayer, but as of yet I haven't had a chance to test it, and it's in it's early stages.\n\nIf I were going to pick a single downside that stands out for this game so far, it would most likely be the limited content.\nThere are several game modes, but the number of "avatars" is pretty limited. (At the time of writing this, there are only 6) and only a few maps. I'd really like to see more avatar units fleshing out the game, as well as possibly more than just the two factions. (Admittedly though, I'm not sure what the storyline is supposed to be, so I don't know how the factions all fit in.) The current game modes with the limited avatars and maps makes things a bit repetetive right now. Some more maps and such would also be nice, and of course, plenty of polishing and balancing.\nThis being an early access title though, I'm sure there's quite a bit more in the pipeline.\n\nOverall, there's a lot of promise in this game, a lot looks good, and it's good fun to play even now. If you've got the extra $ laying around and want something a bit different from the norm, Warshift makes for a tempting morsel.\nIf you'd care to see the game in action, you can watch the game kick my butt in the video link above.","May 14","true","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can build bases, manage armies, and then come down to keep the enemies at gunpoint, gain experience in dynamic battles and customize your main characters or vehicles.\n\nIn 2062, the colonial planet “Enigma” was invaded by an aggressive alien race Atroid’s from the parallel world that has gone into our universe through the hypothetical “Gates of Chaos”. This non-material beings were forced to clothe their energy nucleuses in the strong physical shells (exoskeletons), as they needed to have impact on the environment in our world. As a result, they created an army of alien droids which are capable to fight in any environment and at any temperature. The fortifications of the planetary defense line turned out to be not effective against the powerful energy weapon used by the aliens. Soon, the biosphere of the planet felt the destructive power of their deadly attack, and a half of its surface turned into a lifeless desert. The miner colony garrison that was made up of volunteer soldiers suffered huge losses and was urgently evacuated. All resource extraction works on the planet were suspended, and corporations began to bear huge losses. But, after numerous antiwar protests, the government of the Colonial Republic did not want to risk human lives, and scientists had to create an entirely new army of intergalactic operations. The republican fleet and the assault battalion “Delta”, consisting of cyber-guards, heavy machinery and robotic drones-transformers was sent to the planet. The Commanders who have telepathic skills control that steel armada while being aboard the ARKS. For the purpose of their own safety, they are forbidden to leave the ARK.

I get that it's early access, and things can change.   In fact I am very hopeful that the developer will make this game into the awesome genre hybrid that it can be.\n\nIt's for that reason that I'm going to talk in detail about the one big problem I have right now with this game.   If you want to create a hybrid of an RTS game and a shooter, you need to have some of the RTS commands available in the shooter mode.   The system that they have right now does not allow you any control of your army while in the shooter mode.\n\nTo illustrate my point, I'm going to talk about the third training mission.  In this mission you're supposed to be taught how to expand your base and build an army.  The enemy immediately starts churning out ridiculous amounts of units that will start hitting your base very quickly.   You are given a mech for the battle, which is the shooter segment of the game.  If you hop in the mech you can defeat the enemy fairly easily.   However, you have no ability to tell your buildings to create units or to tell your army to attack a unit.  This puts you in a situation where if you deal with your enemies, your base growth suffers.  However, if you focus on base growth the enemies zerg at you and you get killed.\n*There is an option to automatically create units from your buildings but this will quickly exhaust resources.  It's still not a good alternative to being able to manually queue units.*\n\nAlso in the third mission you discover the problem with base expansion.  You have to move your mech to power nodes scattered across the map to activate them and build buildings.  So not only do you have to balance using your mech and the RTS mode, you have to worry about the time it takes to fly to expansion nodes, then back to defend your units, then back to expanding again.  It's very frustrating.\n\nThe challenge from a game like this should be effectively using your RTS and shooter skills in tandem to defeat a tough enemy.  It should not be figuring out how to magically build an army while constantly being forced to switch to a mode that prevents you from building an army.  It should not be expanding a base by moving your hero away from the defenses, only to constantly have to fly your hero back or watch your inferior units get destroyed by the alien artillery.\n\nThe obvious comparison between this game and a similar competitor is Dragon Commander.  In that game you had basic commands in the Dragon mode for ordering your army to move and attack.  You could also order units to be built as well.  Furthermore your army could capture nodes, so you could attack with your dragon and not be penalized by being unable to expand at the same time.\n\n\nWhat can be done to address these problems to make Warshift a more functional RTS?  Add hotkeys for basic unit construction and army commands in the mech mode.  For example there should be a hotkey to create a rocket launcher unit.   If I press it five times then that should build five units divided across all my structures that can produce them.  A  simple addition that allows me to build up my army while never leaving the mech.   Another example, I should be able to select my army groups by number and have a button that tells my units to attack.   I should have an "attack move" to an area(the area being where my reticule is pointing) or "attack my target"(again the enemy unit in my reticule".  This is absolutely essential because your units don't defend themselves well without orders in this game.\n\nI want to finish by saying that I am very glad that I tried this game because I think it is a genuine attempt to do something very special.  The shooter elements are really solid, definitely superior to Dragon Commander.  The game looks really great.  And I haven't had any significant performance issues.  The game is built on an excellent foundation, but I feel like more function is needed now to take this game to the next level.  I very much hope to see that in future updates.","May 21","false","3.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

All levels are open so there's really no sense of progress. Everything is served up like a sampling tray. Skirmishes are limited to only a few maps and the map designs constrain tactics so there are only a few various approaches that would be effective or practical.\n\nAlso to clarify you can not take direct control of any unit. The only unit you have direct control of is your hero from which there is a selection of three or four for either of Warshift's two factions.  A keyboard/mouse AND gamepad combonation is highly recommended to have on hand to quickly fumble back and forth between.\n\nOn the plus side the concept is solid and so is the eye-candy. Giving the small one man team the game play is reasonably good even at this time despite tactical options being constipated respective of map designs.\n\nTo me this ultimately looks like a prototype sampler for larger development houses like EA or Ubisoft to pick up and run with, doubling the size of the campaign, adding more factions, tacking on fancy voice-worked FMVs and locking away the levels so the whole story isn't spilled out from the start.\n\nIf such turns out to be the case I don't mind the $15 I've spent so far as long as there is going to be a fat discount for supporters if Warshift does, indeed, take the route that Toy Soldiers did.","November 12, 2015","true","1.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I've always been a fan of those games that mix the genres to make something all new and interesting.\n\nWarshift is a game that sells itself as an "experimental project where Action, RTS and RPG gameplay elements are combined in one space epic." Unfortunately, I don't think it does any of these well.\n\nI bought this game wanting to like it, but I can't recommend playing it at any price point.\n\nLets start with the action. The controls are straightforward enough, but it can't quite figure out whether you're "Avatar" is supposed to be amazing or the same as the rest. When you go into battle, your character doesn't even always face the place your aiming, so with melee weaponry, it's hard to get a feel as to whether your even actually hitting the thing you're trying to. And when you get tired of being all upfront and personal, there's no indication of how far things are away, or if the shot you fired connects or hits that tree's leaves halfway there.\n\nOf course, should you think this can be played purely as a RTS, you're mistaken there too. The moment you swap back from Action mode to Strategy mode the game immediately gives your unit new orders sending it off to fight the enemy. Sounds great right? Ha. No. If your Avatar dies, it rips you from strategy mode after a short 10 second-or-so countdown and send you to the customize-your-avatar screen.\n\nOh, speaking of your avatar, as you shoot things or attack things or kill things, you'll get levels of some sort. Honestly, these seem bolted on, and I don't have any idea what they actually do. Maybe that's from not playing enough, or not looking at the screen at the right time, but maybe this game would be a bit better if they stripped out the attempts at being a RPG, and stuck to trying to be an Action/RTS. Not that I think that would make it something I'd want to play.","August 16, 2015","false","1.0"," 28 of 75 people (37%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","37","28","75","3","2"

The problem here is not the bugs or the crashing (which I did not play long enough to encounter), the problem here is the poor implementation of gameplay.\n\nThe first mission plays like a MOBA, but I never felt that the spawning if units did ANY good.\nI buy the best weapons I could afford, but I still had to respawn several times and go back to enemy to keep damagin it.\n\nFlying didn't seem as exciting as it should. Most often I found myself going in reverse just to get a lock of enemies in front of me. I should feel like flying forwards past enemies was foolhearty and reckless... but it felt more like strolling through a warzone.\n\nAnd taking damage was not obvious. I only noticed my health bar after I had already died four times. When you die, there is no explosion or notification that you died... the screen just cuts to a strategic map of the battlefield with you zoomed into a random location. You don't even NOTICE it's aa battlefield map until you scroll the wheel and it zooms out.\n\nGood:\n+ A FEW unique gameplay ideas\n+ Great graphics\n+ Fun sci-fi combat\n\nBad:\n- Poor controls\n- Horrible interface\n- Glitchy movements\n- Unbalanced weapons\n- Tutorial button just links to a YouTube page\n- Briefing videos are so fast, you need to pause just to read objectives\n\nBottom Line:\n- This game is NOT ready for release and should not be sold yet ... with or without 'Early Access' label. It has tons of potential, but only the developers should have to sit through it in this stage.","February 6","false","0.4"," 3 of 19 people (16%) found this review helpful","16","3","19","0","0"

Units auto-spawn from buildings and are automated to attack the enemy base. Maps are not huge battlefields but tight valleys and corridors. There is no real base building ether. You find energy nodes across the map where you can build up to 3 builds.\n\nThe RPG aspect of this game can be something great. You take control of an Avatar and play it like an action game with abilities and perks. Right now there are 5 Avatars with 2 for the aliens and 3 for the human faction. All have unique abilities and perform differently. If they lean more on this tower defense idea and add more to the RPG aspect this could be a good game.\n\nRight now in its current state it is pretty rough. The tank Avatar can flip to easily and die. Pathfinding for units is not great as they can get stuck in buildings. The framerate can drop out of nowhere. I would pass on this game right now but come back in a 6 months to see how it has come along.","August 22, 2015","false","3.4"," 26 of 71 people (37%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","37","26","71","0","3"

This game IS the next generation of RTS. My only true problems with the game are you can't directly control an infantry unit (aside from the cyborg, which seems a bit overpowerd), maps seem too small, but this may be because you have a jet in your arsinal of avatars (I like to explore, maybe an exploration addon, you can explore the map using your Avatar, gain significant resource or tactical advantages, or the support of a local populace, etc.) plus a bigger map means more time spent on  the map, I like to occupy and have fun with my enemy, cause I'm insane lol. Lastly there's all the ususal wants, more units, more buildings, upgrades and customizations for ALL units and buildings (these all feel like alpha improvements and if they don't happen it won't hurt my feelings, just my soul :'C ) Don't take this as complaining though this game is well worth the money, and remember it's still in alpha which means it will only improve.","December 31, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A Mix of an action with TD and RTS built into. You the commander must balance out these 3 things in a nonstop assault from the enemy. There is a Coop funtion but its Local only ATM and its just adding your firends into the "Avatar" Slot Allowing a slight ease of control allowing you to focus on builing, like an RTS or TD, Or you can go down with him/her to fight on the ground. There is only Two factions something like Humans vs Aliens. Single player you play as the Humans. The game has a pretty High learning Curve, but that challenge is fun in itself. Once you get used to it, You will try to limit yourself and play differently each time to try to find the best method of doing something.","January 30","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is very clearly not finished, or not polished I should say. The UI is disgusting at best, buttons often times just don't work in the main and pause menus, the game could be optimized a bit better as even on a beefy computer, frame drops were abound while controlling the "avatars" directly.\n\nHowever, even in it's raw state, there's very clearly a solid idea here, and there's not a doubt in my mind that, eventually, this will be a great game. But it stands that there are some glaring flaws, or at least shortcomings.\n\nThe idea of directly controlling your units in an RTS game isn't new per-se, but I can't think of a single game outside of the Men of War franchise that lets you do it, other than Warshift of course. You also have plenty of traditional RTS gameplay, base building and whatnot. Additionally, those only familiar with MOBA type games will be pleasently suprised to know that unit creation buildings will by default send squads of soldiers marching to their dooms in a fashion almost mirrored by DotA or LoL. Traditional RTS players will also be happy to hear that you can choose to control these units yourself all the time if you so please, your "avatar" included. Speaking of the avatar, it's a little dissappointing that it's the only unit you can direct control during the match, unless I missed something (not a whole lot of playtime after all), but maybe thats just the Men of War fan in me wanting to send a lone infantryman to do the work of a batallion.\n\nIf you're on the fence, then it really comes down to why. If you simply want assurance that the game is functional, then you've got yourself a purchase here. If you're looking for a finished product, then give it some time. I'm going to give Warshift the benefit of the doubt, and a portion of my paitence, and I'm not going to refund it just yet. However, if the finished product is indeed what I'm seeing here, then it may just be the last time I trust an Early Access game.\n\nCautious reccomendation... for now.","January 4","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
