"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dwrlewis/recommended/243470/","dwrlewis","RAYMOND","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dwrlewis/","67 products in account","Since this game is such a mixed bag, i'm going to summarise everything in bullet points.\n\nStoryline/characters:\n+If you want a long, engaging main storyline, this is pretty solid\n+Brilliant cast of supporting characters and antagonists\n+The Maurice burner phone side quest (seriously, do these)\n+Gang hideouts and certain criminal convoy missions (the ones where you can kill)\n\n-A rock's emotions > Aiden's emotions\n-Too many repetive fixer and crime profiler side quests (there are 40 fixer side quests -.-)\n-Theres an atrocious difficulty spike during the very final mission of the game, especially if your trying to keep karma\n-The serial killer side quest has a great buildup, but an anti-climatic ending\n-Theres almost no story benefit to finding the brief cases, weapon shipments, QR codes etc. They all end in a short phone call then thats it, no cutscene or anything really rewarding\n-Such sequel bait\n\nGameplay:\n+Excellent shooting and cover mechanics, seriously cannot flaw this part\n+Enemy AI is BRILLIANT, they shoot where they THINK you are rather then laser beaming you\n+Hacking is good for the most part, steam pipes, bridge raising, blackouts and detonating grenades is satisfying\n+Stealth is good, and mixing this with hacking cameras for recon can be quite satisfying\n+Unlock the burst-fire revolver. DO IT. NAOW.\n\n-Although the key mechanics of hacking are great, it really really needs expanding upon with more options and variation\n-Sweet jesus the driving is painful, car damage works very weirdly, and for some reason when you use slow motion if you held down a key, say to turn left, then when you deactivate it seems to overcompensate and keep turning left even if your fingers not on the key, its really weird. Also you can't shoot out of cars, which i wouldn't mind if we had more oppertunities to hack other drivers.\n-The single most annoying thing by far, that had me nearly smashing my PC, is the inability to look directly up. Heli's float DIRECTLY ABOVE YOU, you can only disable them by looking DIRECTLY UP WHEN STOOD COMPLETELY STILL WITH THE PROFILER OUT. This becomes especially painful when it starts casually layering sniper bullets into you with pinpoint accuracy and you can't do a thing.\n-Using your phone by moving the mouse is a pain\n-Open seas are 2spooky4police\n\nGraphics:\n-Do i really need to mention this part? No they're not anywhere near as good as E3, and it can be pretty unstable when everythings on high or very high. I never had a crash and solid frame rate by keeping things on medium-high setting with motion blur off, but compared to shadow of mordor the PC port ain't great.\n\nConclusion:\nDespite all the controversy, its definately worth a try if you can get it on sale. Make no mistake, its not the game we were promised, and it underperforms massively, but its still a good buy. It feels a bit like ubisoft has tried out a new formula, and whilst it needs refining, they're definately onto something good (no doubt a sequel is in order).\n\n7/10 its good, but it feels incomplete","December 26, 2014","true","34.2"," 960 of 1,139 people (84%) found this review helpful 73 people found this review funny","84","960","1","73","27"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brutaljones/recommended/243470/","brutaljones","Brutal Jones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brutaljones/","178 products in account","If I could describe it as one thing, it would be the combination of Grand Theft Auto and Assassin's Creed.\n\nThat sounds awesome, right? So why isn't the game?\n\nI typically enjoy open world games, but I'm a ridiculously huge Assassin's Creed fan. That being said, Watch Dogs bored me to tears. I've put hundreds of hours into 100%ing the Assassin's Creed games, but I just didn't feel the same drive to do so with Watch Dogs. The main issue I have with the game is that nothing feels interesting enough to spend time doing. I mean absolutely nothing. I didn't give a damn about the storyline, and none of the minigames or subquests ever rewarded me with anything that I felt like had any value. I was excited for a leveling system because I always felt like the AC series should have one, but even that doesn't give you anything of real substance to change up gameplay.\n\nWith the Assassin's Creed games I constantly felt like I was affecting the world around me. In ACII, for example, I felt a huge change in the cities as I progressed by clearing towers, making money and investing it, and gaining new equipment and wardrobes. Things like the constant rebuilding and enriching of my family villa, unlocking new costumes for Ezio, new character upgrades, and new items to use was what created the uncontrollable desire to keep playing. It was a Civilization-like addiction of "it's 12AM and I have work tomorrow? Damn... Well, I can do just one more bank deposit".\n\nThe main problem with Watch Dogs is just that none of that stuff exists. Everything feels completely arbitrary, like there was a producer hovering around the designers' desks repeatedly telling them to make sure that they had vigilante missions like Grand Theft Auto, or to make sure they had vantage points like Assassin's Creed. There's just no point to any of it. None of it affects the world or your character in any way that feels meaningful. And none of it felt cohesive at all. As a result the entire game feels like something patched together by a team of people that know nothing about game design. Like they put a bunch of popular titles on a wall and cherry picked certain features from them to throw into Watch Dogs.\n\nIt's not a bad game, it's just a bland one. It's something that could have been saved and pulled along by a strong story with good characters, which is how I feel about BioShock Infinite (a game that, in my opinion, has poor gameplay design but becomes greater than the sum of its parts due to a great story, excellent characters, and amazing voice acting). Watch Dogs even has a great, pulled-from-the-newspapers theme regarding technological surveillance and privacy. But it completely fails to capitalize on any of it, making zero meaningful points about it. The characters are paper flat, boring, and in the case of Aiden Pearce, flat-out unlikeable to the point that they're actually dislikeable. How you fail that miserably in writing a protagonist is mystifying to me.\n\nAdd in the fact that it runs poorly on PC and you've really not got any reason to consider this. I will say that the game looks absolutely beautiful with the E3 2012 mod, but that's about all it's got going for it. The rest just feels like busywork.\n\nRight now, basically all it is is a game that has the potential to turn out a great sequel. Aside from that, I'd steer clear of it.","October 29, 2014","false","9.0"," 1,643 of 2,041 people (80%) found this review helpful 54 people found this review funny","80","643","2","54","54"

This game has less content than GTA, which is saying something.  The technical issues (constant stuttering, strobe light skies, etc.) make this a chore to play.  The multiplayer is broken as hell.  The 1v1 hacking makes no sense.  You just wait for the person to start hacking you and you kill them, since they aren't allowed to kill you.  The 8 person mode is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because one second, a person is on your team, and as soon as the file changes hands, they're on another team.  It makes no sense.

Did I fall victim to the overly hyped game. Being a huge fan of UBI's other games, AC, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell, etc... I was very excited about this new IP. They claimed "next gen"; sadly it's just a reskinned AC, with some Splinter Cell stealth mechanics. They fell so horribly short in delivering in their claims. The driving is horrible. Makes GTA: IV's driving look realistic. They leave out so much detail. Shooting water doesn't have any effects. Lighting/shadow effects are off (stand in front of your car at night and see your shadow - there is none), poorly optimized. Hacking gets extremely redundant. This doesn't compare to GTA series but it's a step in the right direction. The story is good but I highly recommend to wait for it to go on sale. This is worth $25 or less to play.

I was excited to hear when they were pushing back the release date because it would mean a more polished game at launch right?\n\nUbisoft made this game for Nvidia rigs only. If you have ANY AMD components, you'll likely suffer the same fate as me, crashes gallore (this isn't AMD's fault - more on this later). I have a Nvidia GTX 770 but an AMD FX 8350 processor. I thought I would be fine with a Nvidia card.\n\nI thought wrong. After doing some googling it turns out that Ubisoft gave AMD the back of its hand and worked exclusively with Nvidia in the creation of this game. Essentially, Nivida was allowed to place as much input as it wanted into the development of Watchdogs, but AMD wasn't allowed to even say hello. The result?\n\nTerrible performance (and crashes) with AMD rigs until AMD scrambles to put up a driver patch just because Ubisoft played favorites. Don't count on Ubisoft riding in to fix the problem for AMD users- Nvidia paid them off to make sure nothing like that's gonna happen. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bash on Nvidia, I've been a long time fan of their cards, but Ubisoft needs to work openly with both manufacturers and not play favorites or the whole pc gaming community will end up suffering as a result.\n\nJason Evanelho from Forbes wrote a great article on this madness entitled "Why Watch Dogs is Bad News for AMD Users-- and Potentially the Entire PC Gaming Ecosystem" - well worth the read","May 27, 2014","false","15.3"," 4,918 of 6,506 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","918","6","0","210"

They failed to deliver at launch with my game not even being able to run despite an adequate rig, until a haphazardly released patch weeks later.\n\nHardware optimization is almost non-existent in this game, as it will run horribly even on some of the most powerful systems. Worse yet, user-created patches such as TheWorseMod to allow rendering closer ressembling earlier E3 get overwritten with every official game update, even breaking the install.\n\nOne of the few good about this game is the stealth gameplay (Splinter Cell Blacklist + hacking).

This is where all the money and hype went to? A half-baked GTA clone with a gimmick and none of personality or charm? Where to even begin...\n\nObvious visual downgrade controversy aside, game certainly has its fair share of issues, but it overall manages to deliver a pleasant visual presentation that really gets bumped up in cutscenes which seem to be using some entirely different lighting system compared to one used in the game proper. Much to my surprise the online segment of the game has proven to be quite an amusing distraction, although like pretty much everything else in the game it's copy/pasted from somewhere else, which still manages to tie into the main experience of the game. Hacking mechanic itself is pretty good, although simplistic, and does a decent job of being both in the background and stealing the spotlight when required.\n\nSadly, real problems are with essentially everything else in the game. From derivative gameplay which simply checks off a list titled "GTA clone features; even though we don't really understand why they're there or why they SHOULD be there 101", to performance issues and utterly disgraceful story and narrative which frankly aren't even worth mentioning considering just how bad they are. I don't know if things got cut or whether it was just incompetence, but I most definitely didn't care about what was happening with the main character or any of the side characters, most of which were wasted in similar fashion with very few exceptions. I don't know what went wrong with the game but by the end you're simply going through the motions, with the exception of the last mission which manages to raise some ruckus by turning your tools against you, but it's way too little and way too late at that point.","October 26, 2014","false","26.5"," 992 of 1,294 people (77%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","77","992","1","13","14"

Hmmmm.... That isnt what the description on the store page says but it is what the game is.  Chicago is an Island, there are only 2 children, one dies and the player goes on a killing spree of thousands to hunt down the killer while fighting crime like Batman along the way.  In reality Watchdogs is Dog Poo circling the drain being flushed down the toilet fitting for the look of the Ubisoft Corporate logo.\n\nTips for playing Watchdogs:\nRule 1:  Get the Armored Truck\nRule 2:  Get the Armored Truck\nRule 3:  Get the Armored Truck\n\nMost missions you can just drive into the enemy base with the armored truck and run everyone over.  Even the last mission you can just drive up to some spots and hack terminals while being shot at by all the cops of chicago and stay bulletproof.  In any mission where you need to take out someone in a convoy of cars, just ram them with the armored truck.\n\nMissions where you cant drive just hide in cover and shoot everything or throw proximity IED's around, its really that easy.  There is NO reason to stealth unless the player wants to, either way works.   The only useful gun in the game is the one enforcers carry, soon as Enforcers appear in game the big armored guys, GRAB THEIR BOOM STICK!\n\nChased by the cops or anyone is easy to escape, just jump in a boat.  There are NO police water units just the heli which flies away to refuel or the player can use a skill to disable it.\n\nThese skills listed in order of importance, if need more exp just do the crimes that popup.\nCombat tree:  All gun upgrades and rapid reload tree which includes bulletproof vest.\nDriving Tree:  Offensive Driver\nHacking Tree:  Bridges then Disable Helicopter\nCrafting Tree:  Proximity IED\n\nRating:  6/10  Value:  $19.99 (Value based on combined total of Deluxe edition +Season Pass)\n\nThe review is above the rest is ranting disguised as reviewing or just whatever...  This game is a great example to gain perspective into the entire gaming industry currently.\n\nIn the last 2 years of game development Watch Dogs is the Second Highest costing game made more than 70 million was spent making it.  This is a HUGE problem and as outlined by developers who were and are at Montreal shows how Game Companies mismanage their funds.  Watchdogs bought a license to an engine to use for the open world, out of that 70 million not one penny was spent hiring ANYONE who knew how to use that engine.\n\nThis game had all top reviews from every gaming site, curators, even youtube reviewers.  Even top Youtube reviewers leave out everything wrong with it, ignoring all the bugs present when they made the review which is mind boggling.  Ignoring a games faults doesnt make an honest review, even top game review sites like IGN gave it an 8.4.  There is NOTHING in any of these reviews stating all the problems of the game showing how corporations like Ubisoft who sponsor these sites or send swag get off easy buying off their reviews.  Most games do this and most reviewers fall prey to this behavior.    The only people to trust for reviews in gaming are other gamers, review sites arent for us anymore.  A one sentence steam review is worth more than a 3 page article on IGN, yep said it... haters gonna hate.\n\nEven the audio is terrible.  Its gotta be some of the worst audio in gaming, that running sound which is like a 2 step canned midi repeat at FULL volume.  They sound like their from a free soundboard site.  The horns and vehicle tires screeching sound like a bag full of cats being swung around.  Biggest sin is making the audio all over the place in volume levels, some sounds are too LOUD some cinematics are so soft you cant hear anything and mission dialog can be loud or soft, its just a random grab bag.  Best way to play the game is on mute with music in the background or movies, anything but torturing yourself with this games audio.  Many companies are cutting corners on audio and tuning the sound levels correctly, maybe because the marketing team doesnt care about hearing it because screenshots have no audio.\n\nTime to talk visual looks... It looks like crap... It looks so radically different from the previews and video trailers that its surprising noone sued Ubisoft like with Aliens Colonial Marines for false advertising committing fraud.  Many companies are guilty of this bait and switch tactic used today, or showing trailers custom tailored to show off some flashing thing that gets peoples attention because people like flashing things.  To show what a joke the graphics are the reflections are a stunning example of this, you can be 3 floors up and look at a window and see a reflection of a street as if its on ground level, it does not reflect the surrounding environment.  Want to see a good game with driving how about Sleeping dogs which has reflections from light sources and everything while watch dogs feels like a no frills brown bag.  Many companies are buying engines or using engines they make in house that cant run, its that simple, they either dont hire the talent who know how to use the engine, or make their own and get in way over their head.\n\nWhats more important than looking at the game?  Being able to see it!  There is so much info on the screen from the map for some reason almost in the middle of the screen, to the hacking prompts, objective markers, and timers that players can barely see whats in front of them.  Since this isnt a flat world the camera must be tilted to see the ground to see the route to follow but doing so results often in text or popups blocking the very road in front of you.  The HUD aspect ratio seems designed for a 4:3 screen in 2014!  Many companies suffer from this making the HUD for one screen ratio instead of tucking it neatly in the corners to look like a pro.  Instead using some fixed display size for it, relegating the edges of the screen useless and blocking the middle of the screen.  Worse example is RE Revelations 2 which literally looks like a child randomly put the HUD elements on screen like an old Myspace page.\n\nMore important than seeing a game is being able to PLAY the game.  All these companies of devs who clearly arent gamers but pretend to be make these games and very few bother thinking of how to PLAY the game.   This is another handicapped simulator where for whatever reason your player cant even jump, every obstacle has a prompt to climb it as if thats realistic.  Many objects cant be climbed like boxes or trash cans.  Meaning all the enemies had to do in this game to stop the worlds best hacker was put 4 trash cans around him and call it a day.\n\nThe handholding by devs is taken to the extreme in watchdogs.  From the devs making you fail the mission if you dont play it their way, to making you walk at a snails pace during dialogs, or checkpoints that make you sit through sometimes 3 minutes of dialog before ANYTHING happens.  These of course are unskippable because in the industry today the game devs tell us whats important.  Its as if the crazy homeless man who mutters conspiracies had a way to force people to sit and listen to them, and that is storytelling in modern gaming today.  (Story in Watchdogs sucks anyway.)\n\nLOOK HOW BIG THIS WORLD IS!  Every dev is doing this, yet its useless its all backdrop like in a cartoon where the background repeats as the cartoon character drives down the street.  The world feels dead, cant go in anything, cant really interact with anything.\n\nITS A FREE ROAM OPEN WORLD!  Except you cant even choose your character...\n\nCHECK OUT OUR NEW IP!!!  Many companies are making games simply to create franchises to improve their stock valuation.  This world isnt unique, its literally just this world or like other companies a copy pasted idea.\n/end of line...","August 5, 2015","false","115.8"," 765 of 1,025 people (75%) found this review helpful 188 people found this review funny","75","765","1","188","28"

There’s just nothing to keep you playing after the first 5 hours. The games missions get repetitive fairly quickly, the driving mechanics are just awful the only saving grace is the hacking but even then the gimmick wears off fairly quickly. The port is also noticeably terrible with random FPS drops even on a high end PC gaming rig, and as for those "Next Gen Graphics" well the game looks nothing like those cool E3 demos.\n\nOverall Watch Dogs is a game I cannot recommend there are plenty of better open world games out there for you to play.\n\nEdit: Note Watch Dogs isn't necessarily a bad game it just does not match up to the massive hype.","May 26, 2014","false","7.8"," 1,779 of 2,442 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","779","2","0","51"

Have to literally play in offline mode the entire time since Uplay is literally the spawn child of a mistake obviously. Seriously though EA = origin, Ubisoft = Uplay...whats next? YOU arent gods your small (and getting less popular I may add) and should simply make it easier to APPEASE the fans, not make them hate you.\n\n2) Driving is actually quite nice, reminds me of Need for speed most wanted except for cops being faster, stronger, can dodge alot, and oh yeah cant be shaken off that easily which I love since I like a challenge.\n\n3) Combat is simple: Take pistol with 300+ bullets, cover, aim at head, insta kill, repeat. Not hard at all. To be honest I have yet to even use hacking in combat really.\n\n4) Useless craftables\n\n5) The hacking...the cream of the cake tuns out to be the crap of the cake. The hacking is so small and worthless....heres an example. FALLOUT 3 and FALLOUT NEW VEGAS have more hacking no no no wait wait im sorry thats insulting. BIOSHOCK 1 AND 2 HAVE MORE HACKING then this game. This game is simply click and done.\n\n6) AI is a joke, literally running up and down a walkway trying to get me on the roof but realizing it cant and forgot what cover was. I literally stood there and just shot 1 in the head, another comes by and pop, rinse and repeat and done. NEXT.\n\n7) Crashes, self explanatory\n\n8) Graphics are nice to be honest, dont know why people are ♥♥♥♥♥ing about it.\n\n9) Look I know I only have an I5 however I can play on ultimate with almost no issues HOWEVER the pop in is ridiculous, if your speeding in your car (being chased by cops) you go so fast that the game drops in a huge way to buffer all that detail in.\n\n10) explosions are meh\n\n11) The garage is useless since you can purchase a skill that basically means steal any parked car and get away with it.\n\n12) Towers are an assassins creed clone.\n\n13) The idiotic puzzels, they arent even puzzels its more like pick a camera and hope its the right one. Weapons so far I find are useless since im sniping snipers with my pistol and I literally just started the game.\n\n14) Melee is almost useless since 6-10 bullets and your dead. Stealth is also pretty worthless since you MUST rely on guns OR hacking which by the way wont accomplish JACK since the AI is to stupid to even realize its own mechanics of go over here to i can blow your ♥♥♥ up.\n\n15) Raving rabbit dolls, game is annoying and stupid and the sheer fact I had to hear the WAHAHAHAHAHAHA in my ear totally took away the immersion of the badass hacker persona.\n\n16) Story is weak as hell at the start. You see a cutscene, then a really blurred up part of you driving then bam your thrown into the game and are like WTF, later you find out what happened but I found it confusing as hell since I knew none of the characters he was going after, how any of them were introduced and what part they have in this (so far). Now im guessing they ripped this out to add as DLC in the season pass. Nice job EA your infectious.\n\n17) I clap my hands to the pirates, they saved themselves money.\n\n18) Your to dam serious. (Spoiler). Literally in one mission your just chilling and someone prank calls your neice or w/e. How would you respond? Ignore them...maybe, call the police....only if it was serious, hack the signal, find them and literally snap there neck but not before doing a high speed chase and causing $100,000 in property damage to show you mean business...DING DING DING, so far thats as far as I have gotten and the entire story so far is to find out who hired the prank caller.......Like wtf, didnt know this was Saints row, thought it would actually be sort of realistic in a way.\n\n19) Minigames...literally all over the place and all they serve as far as I can see is to have a high score...\n\n20) The lack of stuff to do. So I have already done all the towers, and I didnt do the breaches since I found them stupidly boring as hell. Oh ok so whats left for me to do? Meaningless stunts to get good reputation......woohoo spiderman.....oh and TONS AND TONS OF ONLINE MINIGAMES.\n\n21) Cash is dam near worthless after a bit of time. Reason is you can just buy all the best weapons right away and ammo is so plentiful you will never run out, and im serious about that, you can fight an army and still have reserves.\n\n22) Annoying, I actually find the hacking puzzles not challenging but annoying. They are either so easy and step by step procedure that the devs must think im brain dead or so stupidly hard and makes no sense difficult.","May 27, 2014","false","23.0"," 261 of 338 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","261","338","0","17"

Wells","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HerbertGWells/","165 products in account","Well, after 6 hours of just wandering around Chicago, hacking cameras and generally getting in to mischief I figured I'd do a review of my own.\n\nIs this game as good as the hype? No. But then let's face it, Ubisoft hasn't managed to pull off anything spectacular since Assassins Creed 2. What you do get is a very nice, if simple, experience. A huge city with masses of detail, idiotic but amusing side quests and general faffing about. I appear to be one of the lucky ones with regards software issues, in that I have not had a single one. The game runs perfectly for me, if a little slow on my i5 3570K, 16GB RAM and GTX 650ti 2GB, with all the settings to a mix of medium and high I maintain 30FPS quite happily, even in intensive moments.\n\nSome of the mechanics leave a great deal to be desired. The mouse control/acceleration issues are quite dire and really need fixing, as does the fact that the mouse is treated as a joypad thumbstick when using the phone or selecting a weapon. Speaking of which, the weapon selection wheel was designed by a blind chimpanzee in a coma using sign language derived from rectal sphincter muscle movements translated in to a crude form of speech. In other words it is complete poop.\n\nThe same could be said for the car handling physics which are akin to a Blue Whale belly sliding on goose fat across an ice rink. With music. They are so bad I have to wonder if they might be improved by simply porting in the handling mechanics for the ships in Assassins Creed 4.\n\nBut menu issues, car handling and the weird ♥♥♥ reflection issues (seriously Ubisoft, has no-one taught you how to do proper reflections yet) this game is fun. Mindless, for sure, but it IS fun. The question remains though, is it €60 of fun? I have to be honest and say I was given my copy by a friend on Reddit, so I did not part with any money, but had it been down to me to purchase it, I may well have decided to wait a few weeks for patches and fixes to be issued, as they surely will.\n\nEDIT: As an addendum to this review I would also like to add that I am firmly in the camp of "Get rid of Uplay" here. The system does not work and will never work as long as Ubisoft fail to recognise just how much work it actually takes to run this kind of setup properly. For the sake of all their customers they, and companies like EA should ditch their crummy, poorly maintained and broken services and hand over the delivery portion of their business to Valve, who at least managed to get the game out to people on time, and with no fuss. Oh and Valve, for god sake get some customer service staff, EA make you look like a damned college kid with a lemonade stand in that department.","May 27, 2014","true","67.9"," 1,174 of 1,727 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","174","1","0","75"

The villain is actually pretty damn unlikeable, and because of the things he does, the tension really ramps up.\nWhen the level design wants to permit it, hacking can really be strategic and make the game much more dynamic.\nChicago looks pretty nice and somewhat realistic.\nFor what it is, it's a fun timewaster to drive and screw around.\nNitpicks:There's a lot of side-content, which is nice, but a lot of it is basically deadpan filler.\nRadio soundtrack is absolutely garbage, but the in-game soundtrack is decent.\nThe leveling system is completely unnecessary.\nThe UI is slow and drab. The Smartphone menu is too slow to feel intuitive.\nCons:The second-half of the story gets really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, swapping out the interesting "vigilante" story for stupid hacking heists and uninteresting plot points.\nThe entire cast of characters are either incredibly forgettable or are downright unbearable\nThe gunplay feels boring, awful, and does not have a satisfying punch to it.\nThe stealth in the game is really good, but the game actively discourages it. Which is an absolute shame.\nWatch_Dogs has no idea what kind of game it wants, and it's messy design shows that very clearly.\nThe game is far from a challenge, and Aidan (despite having low HP) can easily still tank down a lot of enemies in his path due to overpowered weapons and horrible enemy AI.\nThe Review\nWatch_Dogs faces a huge identity crisis. It legit doesn’t know what it wants to be. A Deus-Ex clone in a open-world game? GTA with bad driving? A Ubisoft Sandbox game? The game feels so incoherent because of how poorly structured all of it’s game mechanics is. When it wants to play like a cool Deus-Ex game, the useless upgrades and level design make it seem otherwise. When it wants to be a open-world driving game like GTA? The driving is incredibly poor and the world itself is monotonous to go through.\nWhat basically results out of this huge identity crisis is that Watch_Dogs tries to be just OK at everything, and not great at anything. It’s RPG Mechanics are half-baked and don’t do anything, it’s gunplay feels insanely average and has zero punch to it, it’s random side-activities are not really fun (but they’re functional). I can go on and on, but I think you’ve already gotten the point.\n\nIt doesn’t help that the game seems to be way too easy. The silenced weapons don’t have any limit, meaning you can just silently kill guards with a single headshot. It really made a lot of the supposed stealth sections easy, but that’s not to say I had to stealth them either. Aidan feels like he has way too little HP, yet is somehow still indestructible due to it being really easy to gun down everyone with ridiculously powerful weapons. The game really could had worked out fine if it encouraged stealth, but it’s a lot more reliable (yet a lot less fun) to just shoot everyone with your massive 5-star weapons.\n\nThe big mechanic of the game, which is the (dank) hacking seems to heavily rely on whatever hackable objects and items are placed by the level designers. It’s cool, but it feels so underutilized because the level designers didn’t build a lot of the levels to encourage playing around with the hackables. Sometimes, you can remotely open doors and find passcodes by just remotely hacking. Other times, you have no room to work around with and have to solely rely on your OP weapons to get through the job.\n\nThe game has a lot of side crap to do. Whatever or not it’s engaging is really up to the player, but it felt like unnecessary filler to me. There are stupidly easy and boring minigames to play, uninteresting courier/car stealth missions, and the typical checklist of Ubisoft Viewpoints, Towers, and etc. It’s ultimately not worth doing for the 100%, as it becomes absolutely boring and monotonous.\n\nIt's story clearly takes a huge dive half way through as well. The story starts off surprisingly fine, with a interesting vigilante story that actively poked fun at Aidan Pierce for being a hypocritical sociopath (And there’s an absolutely despicable villain that’s really well done at that point), but at the half-way mark, it trades all of that for stupid hacking hijinks and poorly timed betrayals and twist villains.\n\nIt’s soundtrack is surprisingly decent, but it’s radio soundtrack is god awful. Unlike GTA, I found myself constantly trying to shut the radio off where I can. Voice actors come off as either sounding dull or completely sleep, and the sound design is a absolute mixed bag.\n\nThe game’s visuals are honestly fine. It isn’t as visually amazing at the E3 demo but I didn’t expect it as such. The only thing that was really throwing me off were the character models, but otherwise, the textures and objects (especially when it’s raining) looks nice.\n\nThe PC’s optimization is certainly better than at launch, but it’s far from the best. The game would constantly stutter or eat up my CPU cores (I have a quad-core CPU and it only distributes most of it’s power to one of them, stressing out the entire computer). Performance is far from reliable, and when I was playing I noticed a lot of dips in framerate, which was annoying. Despite finishing it on PC, I later got myself a Xbox 360 copy of the game, because I really didn’t want to deal with the computer performance at that point.\n\nI want to stress that Watch_Dogs is not a bad game. It’s just not a interesting game. Watch_Dogs is a game that tries to be fine for just about everybody, but in doing so makes for one of the most mediocre games I have ever played. The game is poorly designed and cluttered, has no idea what to do with it's story and characters, and compromises so much of it's potential just so it can appeal to as many people as possible. It’s certainly not bad, but the game’s overall design just feels so….not there.\n\nTL;DR - Watch_Dogs is a decent bargain-bin buy, but you could go with less average and boring choices.\n\nFor more reviews on all sorts of games, follow  Lots' o Giveaway's group curations and reviews  here!","March 21","false","35.8"," 240 of 339 people (71%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","71","240","339","15","5"

At least it's not Games for Windows Live.\n\nIn all seriousness though. The game is great, IF, you have the correct hardware. If you're like me and the game is supported on your GPU, you will defenetly love it.\n\n(Now, this review is very short so I don't spoil anything)\n\nThe games story is very dark. Like, darker then my steam name, yet, still the story confuses the player here and there.\n\nI don't understand the fuss about the graphics though. Sure they weren't what we thought or wanted, but seeing the wind blowing the trash and coats around got me over that. Also, the amount of detail put in the map is very large. You will see people helping out someone drunk, trees blowing in the same direction, and reckless drivers, (No there not glitched, they actually are scripted to crash)\n\nNow on to the multiplayer. Theres nothing else to say except this... IT'S GREAT! It's new and I love it! I like it when I get distracted when free roaming, and nothing is better then when someone enters your game just to keep you from dying from bordom. Some people say it's annoying, I say it's genius.\n\nLastly, onto the characters. Aiden is very dull at first, but the later in the story you get, the more you understand how he feels, and this is just my opinion, but I think some of the side characters deserve a story more then his. Like Jordi Chin, I would love to know so much more about him. Overall, the game is great!\n\n\nEdit: After sinking in 70 hours, and not even being 50% done, all I can say is "Wow!"\n\nI'm not saying that there is a "Correct way of playing the game" but if you played it like I did (I played 2-5 story missions a day, and almost just pure decription and hacking people) You will definetly keep playing on and on forever.\n\nThe game is endless. When I first saw the multiplayer for decription, the first thing going through my head was "Wow, this is going to get very stale, very fast." But I was wrong. It feels like im in a action movie chase when I'm on the back of a semi truck while a teamate is driving as explosions of cars and steampipes go through the map.\n\nAnd the hacking... Now, if you have a very clever enemy, this could lead to car chases or boat chases. All though this is pretty rare, it's just so cool.\n\nNow I'm going to go very in depth here. One of the most heart pounding chases I had was when I was being hacked. I was running through an area under construction, profiling everything. Finaly, the map starts to show a location closer to the hacker, then I relized, he was hiding in a semi truck. I imediatly pull out my pistol and shot at it. I managed to get a tire but missed his body. Thank god though for that. It slowed the fixer down long enough for me to get my own semi truck. We began to drive through sidewalks, dirt roads, and bridges. We then hit a dead and and both got out. Now, I relize I could of shot him then and there, but what's the fun in that? We then began to chase each other, climbing buildings and jumping fences. but to my luck, he wasn't paying attention and I over loaded a fuse box, slowing him down. Then I went in for the takedown.\n\nI expect a lot in Watch_Dogs 2. With the success of this game, even if it didn't even get that good of reviews, it will definetly be something to look forward to, My prediction is that the game will be announced in very late or early 2015-2016, and the final game will be released mid 2017. Or they will just pull a Assassin's Creed on us, and announce the game at e3 2014, which is like a week away, and then have the final game released in holiday 2016. But if they do that. They would have to double the amount of people working on it.\n\nAlso. Feel free to add me on steam. I always love to play with other people, Just ask me for my Uplay.","May 29, 2014","true","145.5"," 772 of 1,162 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","772","1","0","37"

I actually bought my first gaming PC a few weeks after I saw that trailer because I was so excited to play it as soon as it comes out. A few delays and graphics downgrades later, Watch Dogs is finally here. Unfortunately, everything I've seen from this game is a letdown. It's a decent game don't get me wrong, but that's not what everyone wanted WD to be, just decent. Add that to the frustration of launch day where it took me 4 hours just to get the game working (UPLAY SUCKS), and this makes WD deserve my first ever thumbs down review on Steam. Wait for this game to go on sale for $5 a few months later because it sure isn't worth $60.

The story is enjoyable although appears to happen at a faster pace then what should have. I did have a lot of fun with this game but I will not recommend this game because of the technical problems that this game has. If you have a new computer with top notch performance then this performance problems might not be there at all but that is for another discussion.\n\nIn regards the the performance, the game provides tons of microstuttering and frequent framerate drops that can harm you ability to perform well in the game. This is after the game has been out for a while. Actually, recently after taking a break, this game just randomly freezes and becomes unplayable. I have seen no improvement but actually a degredation of the performance.\n\nThe rendering distance for static objects is perfectly fine but there is absolutely horrifying draw distance for dynamic objects such as cars, bikes, and things that you could crash into when doing high speed manuverse in a vehicle. This is utterly annoying and ends up being a slap in the face because it ends up being entirely random to when you crash rather then based on your ability to drive.\n\nThe driving mechanics for a keyboard are good but could be better but the crux of the problem is that the physics for your car as compared to others feels different. What I mean by that is you can run right into a car and then drive off while leaving the other car completely destroyed. Somehow your car altough being the exact same in every way can simply drive off. Your character can simply get up from anything and there is no feeling of vunerability.\n\nThe gunplay is good in that it doesn't have any major problems but it doesn't excel in any particular way that any other game hasn't already done equally as well. The number of weapons feels just about right and they feel unique in their own right. Unlocking some of the weapons and having others weapons readily purchaseable feels like a nice touch.\n\nA variety of minigames are there throughout the game. Some of them may not be enjoyable depending on your tastes but I essentially see these games as pretty in depths games in themselves. Completing these can unlock things for the main game. I personally enjoyed them quite a bit.\n\nThe storyline is a moderate length and begs a sense of urgency so I found myself completing several missions at once then forcing myself to take a lengthy breaks from the main storyline so that I could unlock other guns and tools that I might need during the main storyline. Certain plotholes are in the story that could have been avoided by not attempting to simply write off all other possible solutions especially when there are perfectly valid solutions taking a different route.\n\nMultiplayer works out pretty being seamless for the most part. I did not participate very much in this because I did not personally find it to my tastes but it is pretty cool to realize that someone is tailing you and then take them out.","October 7, 2014","false","74.1"," 292 of 427 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","292","427","4","11"

Or, Irreverend Opinions as we play Watch_Dogs!\n\n---\n\nThe Blurb\nAiden Pearce is a hacker out for revenge on the people who murdered his six-year-old niece.  Criminal conspiracies, fratricide, and a chilling descent into the corrupt 'Chicago' government await him.  Watch_Dogs is a third-person 'vigilante simulator'.  Pearce hacks, races, spies, shoots, bombs, and bludgeons his way through the criminal underclass of his city, a driven man on a mission of vengeance.\n\nRecommended for mature audiences, Watch_Dogs features nudity, violence, and combinations thereof (including ♥♥♥♥, human trafficking, etc)\n\nThe Good\nUbisoft managed to get an amazing atmosphere in their repainting of Chicago.  The Windy City feels wet and cold as it rains.  It feels warm and welcoming as you rocket through sunshine on the Loop.  The game's background graphics are superb, getting an attention to detail that many games tend to ignore completely, which adds to the immersion so well that it deserved a standalone point in of itself.  Around you, the city moves and breathes.  People live their lives and little dramas.  Now, this doesn't mean that the main graphics are poor; running at top performance specs, I was questioned by passers-by about which movie I was watching.  Explosions are breathtaking, people walk in a realistic fashion, cars reflect the light as you turn corners, guns flare like an action film.\n\nBoth music and sound often help to keep you on the story; the main music is not too intrusive and keeps to the background, often ignorable until it stops as you near an objective - and then all to evocative of an imminent threat.\n\nUse of background in cinema serves to drag you along with what the protagonist feels.  Here in the game, it's not hard to feel a pang of guilt as you find that the account you just ripped thousands of dollars from was owned by a struggling stage-two cancer patient and his overworked pregnant wife.  It's just as simple to see why Aiden is so angry. Mobsters game the system and the feel of people being oppressed by ruthless, powerful sociopaths isn't just 'backstory'; taking a lot of time to ensure that you are given good reason to want to see Aiden succeed.  Your protagonist is involving, he's no idealist, but he wants to make things right, and sometimes makes mistakes.  Throughout the script, you'll watch an unfolding tale of betrayal, murder, corruption, and self-doubt.\n\nA good variety of weapons are available, with their own balancing of traits, so you can find a playstyle that suits you.  The scenarios rarely favor one style over another, meaning you can work combat in your preferred style, and there are few 'railroad' barriers to prevent you from say, snapping a dozen IEDs to a budget sedan and then sending it careening into the middle of a gang hideout.\n\nMultiplayer matches are fun, with well-timed battles giving a variation on traditional 'capture the flag'.  Tailing and hacking give good 'cat and mouse' and 'hide and seek' gameplay, which can be a fun diversion when you feel like something a bit more challenging than the typical AI NPCs.\n\nThe Bad\nGlitches are a frequent occurrance in Watch_Dogs, giving rise to hair sticking into your nephew's head (rather than out), objectives no longer functioning, NPCs that you need to kill falling through the floor, and more.  Unfortunately, the multiplayer can easily cause this, with laggy invaders causing the engine to make hacking objectives 'unavailable' while you host your uninvited guest.  This also applies to artifacts left over after you take part in another player's game, with police standing and smiling at you, gun drawn, staring into the sunset as you steal their car.\n\nCar music was gets quickly repetitive and jarring, background chatter suffers this same 'finite pool' symptom, with intercepted texts or calls or pedestrian conversations.\n\nUPlay.\n\nThe Ugly\nWhile some people would not find this such a cardinal sin - the railroad that they took out of combat, was thrown into the storyline.\n\nFrom the onset of the game, if the player does nothing fatal to their opponents; taking down goons and gangsters with a Batman-style beating and intervening with the people's predators with panache and poise, punctually pausing their pain with a professionally-prepared punchup; expect the game to ignore it, and not only assume you to be a cold-blooded killer, but act on that assumption for the premise of the story.  The immersion that they give only serves to heighten the disappointment when you realise that your efforts did not matter, and were never meant to.  "Do as we want, not as you want", say Ubisoft, in a more direct fashion than they usually push with UPlay.\n\nUbisoft's efforts towards a believable, involving game are also severely undermined by the game's AI.  When people in "Chicago" start screaming and running off, calling the police because a car drives past them or parks in a parking spot on the road, I have to wonder if the developers ever got to actually see the AI in action before release.  People will panic and scream and cost you reputation or call the police over the most inane nonsense.  "Officer!  I saw a man get into a car in the parking lot!"  Suddenly, a helicopter and patrol interceptor is dispatched.\n\nThe combat AI doesn't fare much better.  The AI tends to focus on going to cover, grenading your position (if they have grenades), and moving closer on occasion.  While this is actually a worthwhile tactic - there's little to no variation on this, despite the variety of enemies you can face ('gangsta' gangers, mafia, professional hit men, mercenaries, riot cops, etc), and it tends to make fighting a little predictable and unrewarding.  Given the role combat plays in the game - a major part, if that isn't clear so far - this is poorly set out.  With the effort Ubisoft have put into the other, smaller details in the game (like how leaves fly up when you drive through a country road), this is significantly more noticeable, and shows that there was a poor allocation of time or effort in this department.\n\nSuggestions\nTo players, don't go into this thinking it's a game that cares about how you do things or how well you do things.  Watch_Dogs has a story to tell, and to get that story to continue, feel free to do the bare minimum it needs to progress.  It won't reward you for going over and above what you needed to, or sparing the lives of the criminal scum of the city in some attempt at 'justice'.  If you can handle that, the story isn't bad, and Aiden's tale is one that I, personally, enjoyed.\n\nTo Ubisoft?  Watch_Dogs is a sign of some serious disparity between your development team and your executives, and the executives can call the shots on release day.  This had potential to shoot far higher than what it got, and could have been award-winning.  The areas that developers couldn't cover, however, is tangible and that degrades the overall experience, like an unfinished, raw-construction corner in an otherwise very tasteful hotel foyer.\n\nThe Summary\nI managed to avoid the hype that came before this game was released, and went in with an open mind.  I hope that serves to illustrate that while Watch_Dogs is a good game with plenty of play value, I was sincerely disappointed with the overall result.\n\nA vigilante story with amazing background, which drags you into a hacker's quest for vengeance.  6/10, 7/10 if you enjoy the multiplayer content.\n\nThe author of this review is highly unimpressed to find that the character limit has been restricted significantly, forcing a mangling of a longer review.  Fie.\n\n---\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","September 23, 2015","true","62.7"," 133 of 183 people (73%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","73","133","183","19","3"

It certainly doesn't live up to it's hype, that's for sure. Besides that, Watch_Dogs is a fun and interactive open world game. The people you see on the streets have names and occupations, which is incredible. The city this game takes place in (Chicago) feels very diverse from suburban areas, to ghettos, to the near futuristic skyscrapers.\n\nPROS:\nLarge map, with most of the land being urban areas\nVERY fun hacking mechanic, allowing you to create explosions everywhere and creating traffic jams.\nAmazing stealth gameplay (however there's a limit on those stealth missions)\nAn excessive amount of weapons and clothing\nFun remote control IEDs\nGood soundtrack\nVery fun sidemissions (except the Fixer Contracts). Gang Hideouts and the Spider Tank were impressive.\n(Might be a con to some) Difficult Police force\n\nCONS\nVery bad performance issues. It is optimized poorly and it's hard to run.\n"Meh" graphics... everything doesn't have texture and it's all just a solid color. The showing at E3 2012 showed refelective rain and beautiful graphics, but there's none of that, no matter what option you run it on. A few texture pops and rendering issues as well. Also, did I say that this game's optimization is poop?\nReputation system doesn't do anything. Being the villain and being the vigilante doesn't feel any different. I felt like I should be rewarded more for doing good things.\nSmall glitches here and there\nBland story and characters with cliche missions and dialogue. Aiden is  uninteresting.\nMemes\nSome open world game things they should've added weren't present (such as shooting while driving).\nWeird car physics\nHuge emphasis on multiplayer -- doesn't work out well.\n\n\nI know that the cons look like they outnumber the pros but I still like this game. It has more meaningful things to do and better mayhem causing to cause; where in games like GTA IV and Saints Row, you will get a little bored shooting the same cops over and over. This game allows you to set traps and wait to ambush them. This game allows you to kill someone stealthfully just because their interests don't appeal to you. This game lets you interact with the city you're in. It's a controversial choice to recommend this game because of it's criticism, but I say that you should give it a try.\n\n\nPS: If you like mass murdering people this game does this best","January 26, 2015","true","50.8"," 180 of 259 people (69%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","69","180","259","12","5"

Head over here http://forums.guru3d.com/showthread.php?t=397511\n\nThe community of this game is filled with negativity, and it's the most unpleased ever along with Payday 2's. In the store page you will only find reviews that say "♥♥♥♥ uplay" and "♥♥♥♥ the performance issues", and they are right, but they don't say anything else about it, leaving the store page with only negative feedback.\nAnd in the forums (and internet in general), you will only find complaints from people, continuously sending you Youtube videos that show only negative things about the game, saying "graphics from actual product are downgraded compared to E3 2012 demo, terrible game, 0/10, failgame" and forcing you to stay away from it, just because it has its flaws like every game ever and they judge this by the amount of hype generated.\n\nIf you want a short, honest review with no hatism or fanboyism, here it is. IF you have the "right" hardware to run this game smoothly, you will experience a fresh gameplay with an original multiplayer (though repetitive), where the city is your weapon.\nBecause of some graphic issues (graphic quality overall is pretty, but unbalanced and with bad building reflections), presence of bugs and stiff physics, this is not a "true next-gen" game, but the gameplay and the story are solid. As a player who also loves car chases, this game does it right. It's like Driver San Francisco, but without double-speed from the AI.\n\nThe story, IMHO, is not "bland" as usually told. If you ONLY focus on Aiden's story - that is, the story missions - of course you would think it's bland. But there are lots of audiologs to find around the city and in side missions. Audiologs enrich the storyline and backstory of the game much more than you think because there's a lot to know about the characters and the organizations. Everything will make more sense once you listen to them, so you could say that the story is either good or bad, just not bland.\n\nSince the reviews are totally subjective (including mine), except when talking about game issues like bad performance on high-end PCs, I suggest you look for gameplay videos and see for yourself, and that is where you decide if you will like this game or not. I know, I'm also frustrated about lack of demo versions nowadays.\n\nIn conclusion, even though this game has few replay value, it can keep you entertained for hours because there is so much content and many things to do around the city, if you are a fanatic of open-world games that is. If you are one of those guys who only do the story and then forget about it, it's not worth the purchase.\nAlso, if you want my suggestion, stop comparing games with other games (e.g. Watch_Dogs vs GTA V like everyone does), because then you'll end up hating new games more often and only discover their defects.\n\nP.S.: I still can't stand how WD and other new games are being released at this state, don't get me wrong.","May 27, 2014","true","145.9"," 284 of 434 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","284","434","0","20"

It's not this generation's Crysis—not even close—but the graphics technology is impressive and promising. Ubisoft worked within an internal engine, called "Disrupt," and plugged-in Havok for software-accelerated physics. I benchmarked Watch Dogs at launch, whereupon it was discovered that a 780 Ti + 4770K—a setup that'd put you close to $1500-$2000—barely made 50FPS with max settings. The game doesn't look good enough to justify such poor performance, so something was clearly going on under the hood. Further investigation has revealed a myriad of issues that sabotage the PC as a stable platform. For starters, we determined that anti-aliasing of any sort in Watch Dogs produces severe stuttering and even full freezing on some devices (270X, 7870) and significant, disproportionate frame drops on others (780 Ti). The word "disproportionate" is key here, as I've never seen performance halved by going from TSMAA to MSAA 4x in any game before -- ever -- on a 780 Ti. Performance should be impacted, yes, but these are new levels of framerate disparity.\n\nWith 5.04 TFLOPS of raw COMPUTE power on 2880 cores, a 3GB framebuffer, and 336GB/s memory bandwidth (384-bit interface / 8 * 1750 clock * 2 for DDR * 2 for GDDR5), dropping to TSMAA shouldn't increase performance from the 50s to the 80-90 range. This is doubly so when considering that a change from Ultra + MSAA 4x to Medium + MSAA 4x saw almost zero performance impact (~10FPS), but dropping from MSAA 4x to TSMAA produced about 30FPS improvement. Something is wrong.\n\nSo I thought it'd potentially be a CPU throttle, as I was using a 3570K when performing this test. Switching to the 4770K, which is a generation newer and $100 more expensive, the bench produced one half of one FPS increase. That's within margin of error, so for all intents and purposes, there was 0 difference. It was not a CPU limitation, then.\n\nThat's when I started to heavily consider the possibility of absolutely no software-side optimization on part of Ubisoft. This stance was reinforced when testing the performance of an HDD vs. an SSD in gameplay once static assets had been loaded (read: not hitting storage for data much at this point). By switching to an HDD, it became evident that Ubisoft is abusing (or misusing) the pagefile before saturating system memory to any reasonable extent. In fact, Watch Dogs barely utilizes 1.9GB of RAM on max settings. That's even less than Titanfall, a game that's arguably far less graphically-intensive.\n\nAnd this isn't even getting to the good stuff -- like rampant CTDs, inexcusable BSODs, audio loops, NAT errors, Uplay's inability to stop drooling on itself, random input functionality breaking (enter key), inability to minimize, the "alt" key getting stuck, and more. Years of English classes taught me that "and more" was an excuse not to actually list more; I also worked as a test engineer in a previous life, so doing Ubisoft a favor, I'm going to combine these two experiences and get this out there:\n\nAll this GPU benchmarking, crash fixing, and performance optimizing later, I think it's about time we officially comment on Watch Dogs as more than a benchmarking tool. It is, after all, a vexingly-hyped game leaving a $68 million footprint in Ubisoft's budget. Putting things in perspective, Battlefield 4's budget hit nearly $100 million (and look how that turned out), Destiny's budget is $140 million, but even that is still pennies to GTA V's $265 million budget.\n\nAll the millions in the world, though, and I'm not sure Watch Dogs would ever be classifiable as "good" or "playable" for PC gamers.\n\nUnintuitive Input Dooms a Game to User Abandonment\n\n\nIf a game doesn't have intuitive input and mechanics, it's doomed to collecting (now-digital) dust. This dates back to arcade games. In a discussion with Mark Cerny some years ago—a 30-year industry veteran—it was made clear that arcade games were explicitly designed with a single item in mind: Keep the player playing. They're pumping money in for each play -- so how do you get them to play without inducing rage, but simultaneously bolstering arcade profits? Cerny answered this question with great depth, but short of designing play to last 2-3 minutes for the quarter, he made it explicitly clear that the controls must feel intuitive and make sense. This dates back to Cerny's 1983 "Major Havoc." The veteran designer told us that without intuitive input and mechanics, developers risk creating a situation where the player feels somehow cheated, unable to pinpoint why they'd failed at a certain task. If the on-screen result doesn't match what the player's brain tells them is going to happen, there's a disconnect; that disconnect ultimately causes frustration and abandonment.\n\nAnd so we have Watch Dogs, one of a great many console-to-PC ported titles that has brought along its console input. Watch Dogs fundamentally alters mouse functionality beyond any recognition, and it does so on more than one level.\n\nMost immediately noteworthy is the uncontrollably high sensitivity on the main menu. Easy enough -- just turn the DPI down. Then we get dropped into the game, where suddenly the movement is immeasurably slow. Fine, then -- turn DPI back up. Easily done with most modern mice. Then we hack into a camera, or open the menu, or smartphone, or hack into infrastructure, and input speed has once again been altered. The fact that I've got to use all three DPI profiles on my mouse—menu, camera, shooting—is a red flag for usability.\nAnd that's before even getting into the matter of 'acceleration' and mouse smoothing.\n\nMouse smoothing is an artifact of the beforetimes, when mice had balls and movement was oft choppy and inconsistent or overly sharp. Enable mouse smoothing with an ultra-high precision mouse, like the G502 we looked at, and it will alter input in a way that feels sluggish and as if the mouse is being dragged through a syrup-coated surface. The effect is "smoother" corners and circles when moving the mouse in such patterns, but that effect is entirely undesirable. When I move the mouse, it's done with purpose. Perhaps not always the correct purpose, but always something that I -- as a user -- have done as second nature. I know that moving my mouse at a certain speed and a certain distance will produce a specific result. I want that result. That's why I've moved in that manner.

Excellent graphics.... but thats about it. The game does not engage, it is simply a beituflly made boring toy. Car mechanics are awful. Quests are pointless. Hacking gets old after about the 10th time you do it.... which will be in about 5 minutes. The idea behind the game is great, but the storu just isnt there. Its bascially an Assassin type game, but without the story, the plotline, and the quests to support it. Even running around smashing things isnt half the fun it is in SR III or GTA....

It's not necessarily bad, it's just very painfully average. The story is stupid and at multiple points tries its hardest to "surprise" you with overly cliche twists that are completely out of character and don't logically make sense. There's so much betrayal, and Aiden seems to instantly forgive any wrongs that are done except for the wrong that the story revolves around, which he psycho obsesses over. The whole story fails to give characters concrete portrayls because without the constant "surprises" the game would be even more boring from a story point. And I haven't even gotten to the overly-cliched use of the word "Hack". You hack everything, things that you wouldn't even be able to hack are instantly hackable. Hack this, hack that, hack hack hack hack. None of it makes sense. I got to the point where I was joking with friends about how I was "hacking" the NPC's lives with my bullets when I got in shootouts.\n\nI'll give the game credit where it's due.\n-The stealth is very fun, I went through many a mission using only the silenced pistol and my magical hacks.\n-The world is vast and very nicely detailed.\n-The graphics are beautiful once you turn on E3 mode.\n-Everything is nicely voice acted.\n\nHowever\n-Super overly cliche story.\n-Driving is awful, and everything but trees are paper thin, drive right on through them without breaking a sweat.\n-The included fast travel is useless, forces you to drive, which again, is awful.\n-Instant fail stealth missions.\n-Boring tailing missions.\n-Characters flip flop personalities.\n-Aiden, the main character, has less personality than Link and has an annoyingly scruffy voice.\n-E3 mode is hidden in the files and has to be turned on via a mod. Really? Downgrading the PC version? How dare you Ubisoft.\n-Points in the story are very boring and you have to keep forcing yourself to get through.\n-Way to much emphasis on hacking, game forces it on you way too much. If you don't hack you better be a damn good shot.\n\nOverall a very average game, not something you'd expect after how much hype and development time it got, it's just disapointing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/243470/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Watch Dogs. Yet another overhyped sandbox game, GTA meets Assassin's Creed, you all heard that a thousand of times. Actually, it was needed. Not to breed those titles, of course. Create a modern-looking game with "added reality" and phobia about hackers, what raised greatly in the recent times. Hackers now as much a trend as zombies, so a cool game about them is a shot straight to 10.\nSadly, but this unavoidable hit was poorly performed, disgustingly optimised, and, the worst of all - it was made by Frankenstein blueprint, where different parts not actually fitting together.\n\nI'll list all major parts and details now, good and bad:\n\n1) The most noticeable feature of the game, a smartphone with implemented hakin' magic, is quite suitable and well-performed. Even the weird uneasy control of this device is natural - just remember your droid phone, completely the same thing. Anyway, with that phone and some applications, you know everybody (and able to use their weak spots against them), you can hack everything you see. You dissolve bridges, switching lights and even detonating grenades on your enemies via wireless channel. Black magic in your pocket. Only problem with it that you can accidently hack not what you were planned to, since it is "click q to win" and if you're on the move, you're pointing in one thing, say, a bridge, but before you notice, camera make its move, and Blam! you blowing up a water pipe. Again, very realistic, happens with touchpads every day.\n\n2) Total control operation system, aka ctOS. It is a fine picture of what our sweet consumer-friendly flat world evolving into. It can be used as your tool , and as your doom. ctOS triggers alarms and send police to haunt you to the edge ot the w̶o̶r̶l̶d map. Also that bIg bRoTHer device collecting all the pron and related stuff he can access.  Every time when Aiden Pearce connecting to another ctOS tower, he can download some of that pron. That ctOS staggering with amount of dirt you can get from the Net. Anyway, if you'll be watching all those sex-related video from ctOS, eventually there will be some noticeable subjects, like the one about teen who explaining to his father why Assassin's Creed is so cool. Or when some guy calling to his father to apologise for own careless and ask about health, and his father lies lifeless under the table...\n\n3) When your smartphone is connected to the ctOS, you see not just a people roaming the streets, but know everything noticeable about them. For some time, it could wake up your consciences. Like not to hack a person, stealing all his money, when you know he has lost his job or collecting funds for expensive surgery... But then you starting to notice 16-years old vice-presidents with black belt in aikido, people who often travels to North Korea, and professional mercs hiding from the justice, but working in the Chicago PD... And you get a feeling that sandbox bull-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you. Well, you can get that feeling not even switching to ctOS. Just walk some blocks on your feet. In the first block, you'll see some guy reads rap to his buddy. Somebody will be drinking and shouting "normal, normal" in the air. People will be conducting normal, typical behavior. But you go to the another block, and see those rapping buddies again, same song. You hear all those drunk shouts. Then you deciding to do something out of the order. Like starting a fire. Make a guess - will you ever see a firetruck? Nope. Not near fire, that's for sure. What I'm trying to say - Watch Dogs Chicago is a pretty cardboard city.\n\n4) Arsenal of guns, which is actually looks very realistic, and for a moment giving you a feeling the game is genuine in that aspect. Sadly, but no matter how cool guns are, ballistic aren't. And AI of your opponents isn't so good. So if in the beginning I was like 5-year kid with every new toy/gun I get my hands on, after some serious shootouts all the gunplay enthusiasm evaporated. Click Q to win, that's what this game about, and guns are generally for show. Get me right, shootouts there, of course, are better than in the Sleeping Dogs title... But not as nearly cool, as 20% of what we saw in the promotional trailers before Watch Dogs was shipped. Generally, Pearce is hiding at some corner, preferable above the targets, performing headshots and sometimes throwing grenades. Realistic? Not quite, but Very Boring indeed.\n\n5) Driving part reminded me of the Saints Row 2. Cars physics beyond suitable, it is way worse than in the Sleeping Dogs. Yeah, hoping you got the point.\n\n6) Fighting bare-handed isn't really a hacker's thing. There is only "press X to win", usual sequence, corner somebody, press button, he's down. It is working in stealth part, but bringing no joy. Especially the missions where you need to wipe some local gang and knock down their leader. Seriously? Knock down an armed bad guy, after I killed dozen of his fellas? Okay, melee is a game-feature implemented for story-telling and in-game challenges, but not for fun, or role-fitting vigilante.\n\n7) Parkour, industrial alpinism and capture of ctOS towers. Well again, "press X to win". While there are some cool animations when Pearce runs along the walls and doing all other pro-free-running tricks, it is all actually pre-generated. That means you can climb on the 3 meter-high wall in one place, and cannot jump 1 meter high in another. Access to towers seems intriguing puzzle at first, but it is there you meet your limits with all ice-cold game planning. Like, "no, you cannot explode or climb over a wooden fence, you need to run it over with a car!", "No, you cannot just climb on the building, you need to spend 15 minutes to hacking all the doors in it"...\n\n8) Story, it is one of the weakest parts, even people who praising Watch Dogs with marks like 8(9)/10, not arguing with that point. While the basic idea was surely a good one, its realisation is certainly a failure. Starting with the protagonist, our vigilante hero, Aiden Pearce. While he Can be tolerated in some ways, he is far from suitable for given game setting. Let's be honest - all those fairytales about black magic smartphones are best-suited for the youth, people younger than 30, maybe even less than 25 years old. And our "hero" surely not in the tune with that auditory. He's too bleak and even inert for them. Talking about hole in the game plot there.\n\n9) The story is weak, basic gameplay features for GTA-alike game, like driving, shooting, fighting - are made in boredom.The world in game is cardboard one. Even the music in the game is awkward (arduous)!\nIs there somewhat somewhere you can do for joy and complacency? To spend at least a few hours in this weak semblance of possible greatness of the game?\nYeah. It is still a big sandbox game based on partially real-looking Chicago, with many many mini-games, sidequests, challenges and so on. At the worst, there are decent chess and very sweet poker you can play with almost real partners!\n\nSo why I set "thumbs up" botton? Why not give Watch Dogs "thumbs down", which it deserve? For the promise. For the shadow of the game I believed it could be.\nMaybe there is a chance. You know, second Assassin's Creed was better than the first one...\n\nOverall mark 6/10.\n\nNB: about multiplayer in this game... all the charts are hacked! Somebody beating all the races in 1 second, and Ubisoft pretending that's the way it's gonna be! Yeah, a game about hackers, sure thing.","July 30, 2015","true","80.4"," 151 of 230 people (66%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","66","151","230","21","16"

I will not comment graphic, games should not be rated by graphics, but that´s a trend nowadays. Wow, pretty rain, wind... that´s where I quit about graphics. It´s not that important if you don´t have any fetish to pretty pixels.\n\nStory...  I´ve been playing this about 2 hours until now. What I remembered, that there was a murder of a close family memeber of the main protagonist. But the best of all, from these 2 hours I spent 1,5 hours running through the city with mobile in hands looking at peoples color of underwear ( really ? ) . Scanning other people is quite a lot of distraction from main story, so I got lost after few minutes of playing game, insted of following story I was looking at npcs and their life stories, like this has aids, this is gambler, this one cheats his wife. Just too much distraction. It didn´t give me any atmospfere for example like Sleeping dogs, from beginning i wanted to play it more and more as I got involved into the story, but in my opinion this game is a mess gta wannabe with with a little bit high tech mobile, but what can you do with that ? you need a cover ? take mobile and it will apper from the ground, want money ? just try to find some random npc.. the car ? the same.. wanna stop crime ? just hide behind the nearest corner... and see.... I didn´t say anything more to that story.... there´s a lot of distraction.\n\nMost of people complain about driving. This is really terrible. Wanna drift into corner in high speed ? yeah sure, push handbreak, maybe in some good luck you wouldn´t stop completely, even if the police car chases you.. btw. They have really strong cars, they can push you out of the road really easily, but you can´t them do it.\n\nAbout the life in a city. There are quit a lot of npcs, which try to make the city looking there´s some life, but the city looks pretty average, I can compare it to gta san andreas. You can see a vet battle rapping in the corner of some forgotten house, you can see some people dancing or kissing, but city seems quiet. If you compare chicago with for example honkong from sleeping dogs, you can see real difference between living city and literally artifical city. City in this game just doesn´t have anything you would like to see, where you wouldstand for a while and look at the beauty around you.\n\nWell about soundtracks, it´s everyone´s taste in a music but I would welcome old style option to change radio station in the car and listen to what I want and  when I want. By my taste that music in the game just don´t match with that what I´m doing.\n\nWell gameplay is really easy-peasy. You will turn your mobile on and you will automatically see, what you can hack. Combat, well hand to hand fights just are not there, if someones attacking you, you just push one button at the right time and oppont is lying on the floor and you have a good feeling, because you don´t have to waste time fighting people and you can scan other npcs till you get mad. You can steal cars pretty easily, cover system is good, you can hide almost everywhere, well and free running ? jumping over obstacles is not free running.. for me, all over gameplay is like assasins creed, not with blade in hand, but with mobile.\n\nFinally, this game had a lot of marketing, was really over-hyped, but I´m really disapointed from this game, maybe it just doesn´t suit my taste, I didn´t get what I was looking for - interesting immersive story, strong main character you will remember, no guiding hands, good  atmosphere...\n6/10","May 28, 2014","false","5.4"," 65 of 89 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","65","89","0","2"

Chicago has been realised very well, with it's large downtown and surrounding outskirts. (Altrough it lacks the Chicago International Airport)\nThe civillians can be seen interacting with each others, and every single individual is different.\nAltrough there are no ballistics, Different weapons have different muzzle velocities, adding a bit of realism. You can also penetrate cover with the class of heavier weapons, like sniper rifles.\nTo the bad part, then.\nThe graphics in Watch Dogs were significantly downgraded, most likely due to the console versions of the game. So the 2012 E3 Trailer looks better, than the Watch Dogs on it's release on Ultra-Settings. The core of this game is that you ''hack'' into different systems. However, hacking in this game is like calling a Cheater in Counter-Strike a Hacker. It has no real hacking elements at all, as it is only a puzzle-like minigame. The main story isn't also vey good. The main protagonist, Aiden Pearce, an Irish-American hacker, who earned the nicknames ''The Vigilante'' and ''Fox'', isn't fascinating at all. He is a cold character, and you really can't sympathise with him, for that reason.\nThe story is short and uninteresting, altrough it has some very good characters. (I'm looking at you,Jordi)  At the end, you just feel empty, and that everything was pointless. And oh, the multiplayer.\nThe Multiplayer is actually quite fun. Running and ramming in Chicago, with your friends can be quite satisfying. However,you have to play multiplayer with the voicechat muted, or else you will suffer from hearing damage, as everyone uses a headset, and there is no text chat. That is just terrifying. The multiplayer is, ironically, full of cheaters. Yes, it is. And no, there is no way to kick/ban/report them. At all. It is one of the worst things in the game. The price tag is also sky high, for a game soon one year old. And oh, the DLC. Needless to mention that it suffers from the same as a Call Of Duty-DLC.\nLittle content, Much price. After finishing the main story, you can always do side-missions, but you will soon discover that there isn't much left to do, as it lacks content.\nEven that the game has many flaws, it hurts my heart to unrecommend this game.\nThe idea was fantastic, and the little good parts the game has, they are worth it.\nOverall was expecting from something bigger, but as always, you never get what you want.\nOh, i forgot one thing.\nUdon'tPlay.","January 28, 2015","false","38.7"," 50 of 65 people (77%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","77","50","65","8","0"

Although the weather appears to be in the High +25's this triple layered jacket has yet to make me break a sweat.\n\nJournal Entry 2\n\nI was able to fix in and listen to a call.... a very...ahem.... private call, of which a man was speaking to his buddy about a sexual experience .... involving his manhood and another ladies hair.... cough ... yes this town does remind me of real life.\n\nJournal Entry 3\n\nWhile attempting to steal from an old women whose "daughter recently died" I heard a violent screech of tires behind me. I whipped around to witness a very large tundra looking truck come flying over the top of a small hatchbacky looking smart car. The car landed maybe 5 feet from where im standing, Citizens have gathered around to take photos whilst yelling "I SAW EVERYTHING" ... the apparently unharmed driver exited his now totaled truck and began repeating the phrase "its not that bad right?" I waited for about 10 mins, unfortunately the police or ambulance had better things to do so they skipped this call.\n\nJournal Entry 4\n\nI wandered into a cafe to perhaps have a cup of coffee... and by that I mean scout out peoples bank accounts. For some odd reason everyone in the cafe turned and looked at me, I immediately thought "I bet its because of this slick winter jacket" Never the less 2 people walked out and I was left alone with a very large gentlemen and the cafe clerk. At this point I was determined to see some action so I pulled out my gun and pointed it at the large man. He told me "whoa whoa you don't want to do this" ... I hear someone calling the cops outside behind me .... I froze in thought for some time thinking .... maybe this isn't what I want to do, just maybe I want to let him live so he can go on to have a long and prosperous life...... hmmmmm..... nah ... *BANG* headshot, he falls to the ground knocking over a couple chairs (wow this feels kinda real) so now hes dead, I hear sirens approaching. Only the shop keeper remains, .... *BANG* First shot hits his shoulder.... *BANG*...

I have knocked out several police vehicles using traffic light hacks and a bridge raising or two. The crashes look quite violent and the slow motion makes you go "oooooowww" as the cop plows into cars and blockers behind me. I take a corner a little to fast and clip a sports car, this sends me flying off my bike through the air into the side of a building (ouch).\n\nJournal Entry 6\n\nThe police arrive just in time for me unveil a large pump action shotgun from my trench coat (great timing officers). They pull up, crack their doors and draw their guns. I begin pumping round after round into the police cruisers, Glass and sparks fly around, I can see the cruisers deteriorating as the officers cower behind the doors. Then *Click* uh oh... no more ammo, now its the officers turn.  At this point in time it was .... run away dodging bullets.... or.... face them like a man..\n\nJournal Entry 7\n\nWell this is it, the moment Aiden Pierce has been working up to in my story. Before the officers get a chance to start firing I realize I still have my 1191 Pistol... I passionately draw it from my holster and aim it at them, walking as slow as my controls will allow. I kick in the slow motion (focus) ability... I'm now walking fearlessly in slow motion at the police officers as their bullets graze passed my head. I drop almost a full clip killing 2 of the now 8 officers, I finally am delivered a shotgun blast to the chest from a young looking cop...

Should we give Ubisoft s%#t for this game? Ugh, YEAH, they deserve it.  I'm not going to be talking about how buggy it is though.\n\nPROS:\n\nStory: Story wasn't that bad, was kind of neat actually, lead to a lot of plots and stuff, but after a while it just kind of turned into what you were expecting, and then there is that one villain you just can't WAIT TO MURDER.\n\nHack into (almost) everything: When I started off playing I didn't think I would be able to hack a good chunk of things in the environment, like signs on highways, forklifts, cherry pickers, etc. it's pretty neat how you can control most things in the world.\n\nBlurbs on civilians: I walked around with my phone out just kind of staring at things, every single civilian has a little blurb about their life, what their names are, what they do, what they make in a year, it's interesting that the civilians on the side of the road actually have little information over them instead of them just being another NPC in the way between you and a goal, even though they still ARE between you and the goal half the time.\n\nLights and pipes save your life: Using traffic lights, steam pipes underground, etc. help you escape or lose heat from the cops or the gang members you end up getting into fights with, you use the traffic lights to destroy cars behind you, steam pipes to blow them up, and blockers (Those things that hide in the ground) to stop them from chasing you.\n\nLots of things to do: There is a s^%t ton of stuff in this place, from spying on people in the city, to getting briefcases, to playing poker or chess, I ended up wasting hours upon hours in the little activities, which were really fun to do, and sure wasted a lot of my time that's for sure.\n\nScrewing with enemies: Later on you get perks like arming enemy grenades that they better throw away or they are gonna go BOOM, I had a few occasions when I armed a guys grenade, he took it off, threw it to the side near 2 of his buddies and they died from it, was pretty neat though.  Or make them go check out a area that made a noise and you slip by, it's really fun.\n\nBe stealthy or loud as possible: Knowing me obviously i'm going with stealth side, which is really neat, i've done some missions without killing a single person, not including those camera sequences.  I would try to distract them as much as possible and slip through undetected, getting the stuff I needed and leaving the area like I wasn't even there.  Unlike in games like Thief 1 and 2, when I leave a area with every enemy alive and my objective done I actually FEEL like I made them look stupid, the old thiefs (Other than Deadly Shadows and Thief 4) the guards were just stupid, and I felt like I was just pointing it out that they WERE stupid.\n\nCONS:\n\nCan't aim out the damn window: Is this a joke or something? What, I can't take out a pistol, aim behind me and try to pop the enemy's tires? For gods sake people, it's not hard, maybe do this if you feel like actually doing something in the damned car.\n\nQuick Time Events for traffic lights, steam pipes, etc.: Yup, instead of carefully timing when to use the lights, pipes and such to get rid of a enemy you basically just mash Q untill it happens (or X if you are a console person, ew.) This sucks honestly, I figured I would have to time some things right like the lights or the blockers, apparently not.\n\nAiden himself: Aiden is kind of a mixed bag, I like the fact he's trying to be seclusive and not want to really show emotions, that way you can kind of figure some things out, but honestly, he's not very interesting most of the time either, so he kind of seems just flat out bland.\n\nTrailing with cameras: This gets pretty boring after a while, I used to think it was fun, but after a while when you have to trail camera after camera it gets kind of tedious to do so.\n\nChicago looks really boring: Honestly, there isn't much in Chicago itself that looks different or changes the tone, the only place that looks different is Pawnee which is kind of out in the forest, which was pretty neat, so most of the place looks the exact same as the last place you were at 5 minutes ago.\n\nGame over if caught: This, f%$king, sucks, mainly for criminal junk, the way criminal things work is that you find a guy that looks shady in a area, study him, wait till someone else comes up to him, when s%$t hits the fan, you jump in and kick the guys a$$.  Sadly, I always ran in a few nanoseconds too early because I'm just like that and wanted to get to him quick, which means I got caught and couldn't do it again, what did I do? I pulled out my golden deagle and shot both of the f%$kers and left.  It does the same for missions too, if you get caught you lose, and have to start over, again.\n\nKilling cops means losing karma: This is stupid, If I shot the cop first then yeah I understand that, but what if they are chasing me? I should be ALLOWED to kill those t%$ts, this is just rediculous.\n\nNo Melee system: WHAT?! That's even worse, you can only do performed takedowns on enemies, so I can't punch any random motherf%$ker on the side of the road? even if he's a total a$$hole? Apparently THE COPS CAN MELEE ME, why can't I?!\n\nSoundtrack: I mean the music on the radio, the actual game soundtrack is pretty good, but honestly I skipped over all of the songs in the game and only found 1-2 I actually liked from the rest, that's kind of sad, especially when games like GTA (Other than GTA V, I honestly hated most of the music in that.) I can listen to every radio station and like all of the songs\n\nUnderused characters: Jordi (Or whatver that japanese guys name is) is WAY under used, honestly him, Clara, and T-bone are the only characters that have some soul, and Jordi is way under used, he's awesome actually.\n\nCONSTANTLY hacked into: Every, f#$king time I was about to do a mission I kept getting hacked by someone else, so I just turned it off, it gets annoying trying to do one thing and constantly being pestered by other players.\n\nFree roam with friends: This is boring as f%$k, nothing to do other than p%ss off the cops and make a chokepoint, and just murder all of them, there should be activities to do with them, like chess 1 on 1, or drinking, or a 4 player poker game with others, I think that would have been really cool.\n\nObvious sequel is obvious: They make it seem like a sequel throughout half of the damn game, seriously, it makes me feel like it's just half of the game I was expecting instead of a full, actual game, that's saddening, honestly.\n\nWHAT I THINK:  Honestly, the game is pretty fun, but with all of the annoying junk they didn't do or did wrong makes the game just utterly bland, at least there is activities and other stuff to do though, so that's good at least. Score wise eh...i'm stuck between 6-7/10, probably 6 though, it's fun and nice, but has so much wrong with it and not what I was expecting from the E3 trailer last year/2 years ago.  For 60/70 bucks? No, 30 probably.","June 19, 2014","true","26.8"," 53 of 72 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","53","72","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/prmaguiar/recommended/243470/","prmaguiar","Shiro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/prmaguiar/","1410 products in account","My first impressions of Watch_Dogs were negative. The game performed very poorly, there was a noticeable downgrade in graphical fidelity compared to what was shown to the public in E3 2012, the plot seemed uninspired and the protagonist was the dullest and most hypocritical character I had ever seen.\n\nDespite it all, I decided to stick with it and play the game to completion. I finished the main story missions, side missions and bonus missions that came with the Deluxe Edition.\n\nThere's no doubt that there's enough content here to justify the price. Watch_Dogs' rendition of Chicago is huge and feels alive, and there is plenty to see and do. In addition to the aforementioned missions, there are numerous minigames such as poker, chess, drinking games and the great "digital trips", adding an element of fun to the otherwise serious tone of the game. Among these so-called "trips" is a mode in which you control a gigantic mechanical spider armed with a minigun and missile turrets, and your goal is to wreak as much havoc as possible.\n\nThere's a healthy blend of action and stealth segments, and the ability to cause major blackouts and to "hack" almost anything in the city to change the landscape of the battlefield in your favor adds a very interesting layer of depth to the solid gameplay mechanics that can be found here. However, all of these powers can make the game too easy at times.\n\nMy complaints regarding performance persist. I can deal with less than 60 frames per second. What I can't deal with is the severe stuttering that occurs randomly every now and then, as it greatly affects my enjoyment, especially during car chase sequences, often causing me to run over pedestrians.\n\nAnd that leads me to another complaint I mentioned in the first paragraph. The protagonist, Aiden Pearce, is supposed to be a "vigilante", ever watchful of wrongdoings. However, he sees no problem in sacrificing innocent civilians to achieve his own goals. He might travel to the other side of the city to stop an armed robbery, but he'll kill at least five cancer patients, charity workers, newlyweds etc. on his way there without much consequence. Sure, your "street rep" is decreased, and eventually someone might inform the police. But when all it takes to evade the cops is getting into a boat and sailing into the sunset (the police force has no boats), why bother? Also... those blackouts I mentioned? What about people in hospitals? What about all of those bank accounts I hacked to steal money from those same cancer patients? There's no in-game punishment, and your own morals can only carry you so far in a game.\n\nOn top of that, Aiden's voice actor clearly did not care for the character, either. He just sounds boring and bored.\n\nAs for the multiplayer component, I have to say, Ubisoft did an excellent job here. There are several modes to choose from, but by far the most compelling one is Online Hacking. In it, you "invade" a player's "world" and try to "steal data" from him. The target, once notified of the invasion, will have a limited amount of time to find and eliminate you. This is all integrated seamlessly into the single-player mode, which means at any given time (except during missions), another player might be  tracking your every movement, waiting for the perfect moment to act. This is optional, of course, so if you want a completely offline experience without interferences, you can have it. But it's such a fun game of cat-and-mouse, that I highly recommend you at least try it.\n\nRegarding graphical fidelity, there's no question that even in max-settings, the game falls short of the visuals presented in the now infamous E3 2012 trailer. However, it does look great. Water effects, in particular, are probably the best I have ever seen in a game. There's a community-made "patch" that unlocks some hidden configuration settings for the graphics, while also reducing stuttering. It's called "TheWorse Mod", and at the time of this writing is still in version 0.8, but does the job well.\n\nFortunately I didn't run into any problems with uPlay, and managed to play the game offline when I needed to. Not everyone was as lucky, though, so Ubisoft's DRM system is something to keep in mind.\n\nOverall, it's a very good game, hindered by a couple of serious technical flaws and lessened by a forgettable main character. I  do feel like the pros outweigh the cons, though, so I can safely give it a thumbs up.","July 9, 2014","true","72.7"," 72 of 106 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","72","106","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HennersL/recommended/243470/","HennersL","Hella Henners","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HennersL/","90 products in account","For a game that was set to usher in a new generation of video games, Watch_Dogs was and still is a huge and total dissapointment. From the numerous delays to the graphical downgrade the game suffered since its E3 debut, there really is nothing redeeming or noteworthy that could make it worth recomending, even during a Steam sale. Watch_Dogs plays out pretty much exactly the same as any recent Ubisoft adventure/shooter game like Assassins Creed and Far Cry 3 and 4. Underwhelming story with a sassy antagonist that gets you infiltrating bases to slowly unlock the world, area by area (think back to the outposts/radio towers in Far Cry 3 and then swap those with the CtOS centres). Then throw in the waves of tiered enemies that spout the same 3 lines of dialogue that seem to have been recorded at the lowest possible bitrate. However, even if that doesn't phase you in the slightest, you will still want to give Watch_Dogs a miss. The Ubisoft DNA continues to permeate with Watch_Dogs being a pretty terrible PC port, even with all the fuss they made about PC being the lead platform. Even with recent updates, the game is a mess with fluctuating frame rates that refuses to run smoothly on pretty much any machine. Throw in all the NVIDIA Gameworks "enhancements" which basically guarantees that the game also runs like crap on anything AMD based. Maybe these performance issues would be worth it if the game was visually impressive, but it simply isn't.\n\nTL;DR - To sum up, a very underwhelming game full of Ubisoft's nasty practises that runs terribly on PC.  Do avoid, even if its on sale and save your money for something else (or even GTA V on PC in 2015, which I guarantee that you will be playing a lot more often than you would with Watch_Dogs. There is literally no replay value here.)","November 26, 2014","false","23.0"," 79 of 118 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","79","118","3","0"

I found it really enjoyable. The story is very engaging and engrossing. People complaining about the main characters emotions aren't really paying attention to the story line, or playing the side missions to get more info.\nOf the cons I would really have to stress vehicle physics and handling. The cars feel really uncontrollable, and the motorcycle feels like it's hovering.\nI've heard a lot of problems with controls of the game as a whole, but I own an Xbox controller and didn't have any issues. If you want to play 3rd person games like this and don't own a controller, I highly recommend you go get one. It's freaking cheap and easy to do.\nIf you are looking for a GTA clone, look elsewhere. This game does not reward you for being a psychopath. The whole vibe of the game is that you are a vigilante looking for justice.","March 23, 2015","true","77.0"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","29","35","0","0"

So much so that the game is almost entirely unplayable. This is after several patches were released, mind you. If you start driving, expect anywhere from 10-20 FPS with more stuttering.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mostlynice/recommended/243470/","mostlynice","Mostly Nice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mostlynice/","774 products in account","Watch_Dogs Review: (EDITIED – Still a No.)\n\nRuns on ultra-seamlessly, but drops out when TXAA is on. Still can’t work out why considering my card is fully supportive of TXAA.\n\nBrief spec:\ni7 4770k\n32Gb HyperX Ram\nAsus GTX780oc (940-1150GHz)\n256GB Samsung SSD (currently has Watch_Dogs installed onto it - No advantage so far over SATAIII)\n\nGame is run on Ultra and tested both with and without SweetFX settings applied.\n\nThis review is an edit of my last one. I was previously very annoyed at the settings configuration and getting severe frame rate issues, especially when alt+tab’n – meaning I had to close the game down and restart it. These have since been fixed with a few adjustments. I’m just going to list pro’s and con’s for this game. It’s a vast, ambitious title – yet it can be summed up with simple yes/no elements.\n\nThe Pros:\n\nThe driving element in the game is spot on and mimics the quality of GTA5. Cars handle uniquely, and the perk system really puts a lot of fun into driving.\n\nGraphics are second to none. This is probably the most graphically advanced game to grace PC. The lighting and shadows are fantastic, the water physics are amazing and make just piloting a boat a heap of fun alone.\n\nShooting is at first not so great, at least not for a 3rd person game from ubisoft. However, as you progress you level you can increase things like reload speed, stability etc. This makes it a pretty good shooter and you’ll need some real shooting skills to kill everyone in your way.\n\nYou are never far from a crime. Importantly, you don’t have to go snooping around to do a bit of good Samaritan work. The Ctos will do that for you and while you’re driving around ti will coolly ask you to place a HUD marker to the vicinity of the crime. Pretty neat! This keeps game play consistent, fresh and makes you feel like a bit of a god!\n\n\nThe Cons:\n\nLack of soul. I don’t know what it is about this game, something I cannot put my finger on – it just doesn’t have the character. Maybe it’s the overdone, cheesy, emotionally charged storyline.\n\nThe hacking tool is a novelty that quickly wears off and makes this just another sandbox game with barely any soul. If you’re really interested in that kind of thing maybe you’ll get more fun out of it than I did.\n\nUplay. Enough said.\n\nNothing new. Aside from being able to interact with the city, this game is not set-apart from any other recent sandbox. I’ve had more fun in SR4 so far than this, and for good reason too.\n\nSlightly askew, drab characters themselves, I’m not sure. But I haven’t laughed, I won’t cry and nothing is going to tickle me to make me fondly remember this game.\n\nCustomization is pretty average. I mean there are a few dozen outfit colours for maybe 3 variation of the same coat, hat and trousers. Very bland. Once again, nothing compared to that of GTA5 or the mighty SR4.\n\nCar customization is non-existent. Shame because the car design is pretty good.\n\nNo ability to fly helicopters/planes. Seriously? I’m an elite hacker but I cant hack myself a nice chopper or jet? I can’t even hack into a helicopter chasing me and crash it or eject the pilot?\n\nBelow average music/radio. Oh I can play my own music though? Thanks ubisoft! I never knew I had that option.\n\nOnline ‘invasions’ are boring and 50% of the time cut-out. My net isn’t great but it’s good enough. Shouldn’t have this problem. Maybe it’s Uplay?\n\nCurrency in the game is almost pointless. Reputation again is a novelty.\nI can shoot pedestrians but I can’t do take-downs? LAME!\n\nI bought Watch_Dogs because I am a sucker for eye-candy and it is no doubt beautiful, but it doesn’t have the staying power of a traditional gob stopper release. I’m not enthralled by the story, not won over by any characters or intrigued by anything else the game seems to offfer. Maybe the American’s love the whole vigilante terrorist vs regular terrorist thing going on here but for me, it’s just not cutting edge enough to have been worth the RRP and not enough to win me over.\n\nOverall, I mean the game is pretty nice – great feel to the map, nicely set out and amusing from time to time. Other than that, it’s a soul-less release that doesn’t have enough quality in the ingredients to make it not easily forgettable.\n\n‘Next-gen’ score:    6.5/10\n\nJust because the GFX and interaction are cutting edge, doesn’t mean the game is. Wait for sale. Watch_Dogs will make a great ‘in-between’ game when waiting for that next big release. Alternatively, GTAV will come to PC, wait for that. It will be worth every penny and make a great PC sandbox or get SR4 now! You will not regret that purchase!","June 7, 2014","false","13.9"," 59 of 87 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","59","87","0","26"

But little did I know that I'll be greeted by a sweet, cute application called Uplay at my click of play. I said, "hi", it said "Logging in", I said "yo", it said, "Looking for updates", I said, "yolo, terror", it said, "Uplay has encountered an unrecoverable error".\n\nAfter a heap of struggle, I managed to bypass the tantrums and finally launched the game. Upon doing so, I found myself playing with a character who called himself a badass while no one else did so, who thought himself a vigilante while no one else thought so, who had a soliloquy at the beginning of every mission with the cheesiest dialogues on earth and called himself a protector of the city. I thought, "Alright". Then I started driving around the windy city when I found myself driving in a ferrari-like but what felt like a 5 year old's bicycle. Then I thought, "fine". Completing the first two acts of the story, I thought the "cute app" could be of some use perhaps. Thinking so, I unlocked a reward with my Uplay points. But then I saw, my game struggling to go beyond 90% of its loading screen. And then I realized, "Gone are all my saves."\n\nWhat's good in Watch_Dogs :-\nStunning and beautiful visuals.(TheWorse's mod)\nGameplay feels fun at times.\nUnlocking abilities makes you feel powerful.\nWhat's not so good in Watch_Dogs :-\nA totally futile, lackluster story.\nUnrealistic driving physics.\nClichéd script-writing.\nCapricious lead character.\nSide missions are irksome and jejune.\nMultiplayer gets old and mundane very soon.\nMoney and reputation, both are trivial.\nAnnoying bugs persist throughout the game.\nThe game doesn't offer a challenge in even the hardest difficulty.\nHacking is sloppy and uncreative.\nUnspirited soundtracks.\nBad portrayal of characters.\nHorrendous execution of the idea of a digital world.\nAwful lasting appeal.\nUplay.\n\nWatch_Dogs presents you with beautiful and enchanting visuals but fails to deliver anything beyond that. It is shallow, unoriginal and overly simplistic. Its multiplayer and the whole of idea of hacking looks fun at the beginning but gets boring and monotonous soon. With weak car chases, awful writing and a terrible story, Watch_Dogs is not something you will ever want to play.\n\nMy Rating - "Deplorable, nothing worth playing even once"\nTraditional Rating - 3 on 10.","August 27, 2014","false","205.4"," 39 of 54 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","39","54","4","11"

Not because it didn't perform like most of the so called "hype" had proclaimed, but because it does not work.\nIt took several hours of my day to get past the uplay program, which constantly told me i had no internet connection (as i was listening to music on youtube i might add), and when i tried logging in offline it told me i had to log in online at least once to use this feature. By now i was looking a little cross, but was still determined to play the game, after resetting and rebooting everything, the game logged me in. Now, i hit new game and waited, and finally it started to load! the first cut scene came in and i was feeling pretty good, still thinking "this game better be worth the hassle", and as the cut scene ended, the game crashed. I let out a looong sigh and Uplay told me it had encountered an error and had to close.\nFrom then on out every time i started the game, my computer driver said the driver has stopped responding and has closed.\n\nI frankly expected alot better from the company branded with making AC, Splinter cell and other really solid great games. This game does not work, my computer is not old and works all other games just fine.\n\nIn short i do not recommend this game until it is fixed, it looks like fun but does not work on apparently quite a few peoples computers.\nHeres hoping you read this and heed the words DO NOT BUY until you hear it is fixed, elsewise you risk wasting money on something you may or may not be able to play.\n\nUPDATE: Game worked! for about 20 minutes, i started playing and honestly it was pretty cool\nThen, the drivers crashed again. So i still don't recommend this game.\nUPDATE 2.0: FINALLY i have upgraded my computer in ways this game could not have seen coming. New power source, new graphics card and new drivers. Low and behold the game is actually not great, even running smoothly most of the missions are anoyying and very forced. Wandering around the city and doing side missions is the best part of this game and that really only holds the attention for an hour or so.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/recommended/243470/","geoluz","GeoLuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/","180 products in account","Watch_Dogs is a game set in Chicago, a city run by an operating system known as ctOS. It runs everything in the city, including traffic and trains. Everyone seems to have a smartphone and you depend on your smartphone to get around town and survive the challenges that make up the plot of this game.\n\nYou are Aiden Pearce, a man who is haunted by his tragic past and is looking for revenge. Aiden has quite a boring personality, but he is trying to uncover a conspiracy that involves an underground cyberterrorism organization bent on hacking the ctOS, government corruption, and organized crime. Aiden’s smartphone is the key to uncovering the wide conspiracy, as it contains creative apps for hacking.\n\nThe smartphone app that is in constant use is the Profiler app, one that profiles every citizen roaming the streets of Chicago. You can learn their names, their incomes, and their hobbies such as child porn or what kind of business they own. It’s pretty scary that a mobile app would disclose such sensitive info about other people, but the most useful info is the bank account info. You can hack their phones to download the bank account info so that you can withdraw their cash from one of the local ATMs.\n\nWatch_Dogs is an open world game like the Grand Theft Auto series, Assassin’s Creed series, and Far Cry 3. There are many side missions to complete including convoy, human trafficking, missing persons, and racing. Convoy requires you to pursue a target being escorted by his convoy. You must either knock down or kill the target. It can be fun, but it gets a little repetitive after several missions. Human trafficking requires you to find info on human traffickers that will ultimately lead to the main human trafficker in an exclusive contract upon completing all human trafficking missions. Missing persons missions require you to find dead people scattered around town who were killed by a serial killer. Racing requires you to deliver vehicles while evading police.\n\nIn the main story you are guided by a guy named Jordi Chin, a “fixer” who is apparently friendly but his association with Aiden is strictly business. The main story is reasonably interesting and requires quite a bit of creative hacking to complete multiple objectives. The smartphone is relevant because many of these missions require infiltration of secure locations guarded by armored guards. There are usually multiple ways of completing each mission, but the most creative way is by using your smartphone to hack into surveillance cameras. It is possible to hack into one camera, then hack into another nearby camera. You can also hack into a camera an armed guard is carrying so that you can see what’s ahead of him as you plan your next move.\n\nThe cover feature in the game is crucial to survival on both the main and side missions. Using cover is useful during firefights and while using stealth. I used cover while hacking into a nearby junction box with my phone so that the junction box would explode near an armed guard. However, the only problem with the explosion is that it will alert other armed guards. Other hacking methods include disrupting communications of armed guard that would send a such a loud blast of music that would enable you to sneak past him without him ever noticing and triggering a grenade to explode in the guard’s possession while he frantically gets rid of the grenade before explosion.\n\nThere are hacking mini-games that allow you to intrude the servers of the city’s buildings, allowing you to see exactly what a resident is doing. This hacking requires to transmit data flow from one node to another by directing a blue stream of energy by rotating nodes until the data flow is blue. You must reach a determined endpoint as you rotate the nodes. Some of these hacking puzzles are more complex than others and there are some nodes with red outlines that are timers that require you to solve the puzzle in short time before the network is reset.\n\nThere are many weapons Aiden can access for combat and can be purchased at the various local gun shops. There is a combat skill tree like skill trees for all other abilities on your smartphone, including hacking. The combat skill tree allows you to upgrade your ability to use each firearm. There is no rocket launcher for you to blow anything or anyone up, but the grenade launcher can definitely get you out of a tight situation. The grenade launcher really helps you out in a battle against enforcers, the most powerful and most armored guards in the game. An interesting ability in the combat skill tree is Focus, which allows you to slow down time while shooting it out with other enemies. The AI of the enemies is reasonable, as they will react if they see a downed comrade or if they hear an explosion. They will take cover and flank you if they know your location.\n\nThere are online multiplayer activities that you can undertake such as online hacking and online tailing. These activities are contracts that affect your notoriety. Notoriety is a points system that can fluctuate according to how successful or how bad you are against other players. After reaching a threshold notoriety number, you can gain features such as anti-vehicle rounds and jam coms boost. Jam coms are special equipment you can use to keep the police or fixers from determining your location. Your mini-map may show yellow circles that indicate the police are trying to find your location. You can use jam coms to thwart their ability to locate you. At any time during the game you can be invaded by another player who is trying to hack your data. You will have to locate that player and shoot him before he steals 100% of your data. It always feels appropriately unsettling when you’re trying to start a new side mission or story mission only to realize that you are suddenly being invaded by another player.\n\nThere are regular notifications about a crime detected on a particular street. Some searching around the area with your smartphone will show either the potential criminal or victim and you must hide so that the crime can be committed before taking action against the criminal. Once the crime is committed you can chase after the suspect, neutralize him and increase your reputation. Your reputation will affect how civilians will treat you. If you increase your reputation to vigilante, civilians will be less likely to report you to police, thereby making life easier for you on the streets of Chicago. The streets of Chicago look very realistic with skyscrapers, middle-class neighborhoods, and run-down neighborhoods that look like ghettos.\n\nOther online activities include chess, poker, shell games, and drinking games. These extracurricular activities test your skills related to Focus and help earn you cash if you win. There’s also a “digital trip” that allows you to ride a spider tank so that you can engage in city destruction and kills cops without damaging your reputation.\n\nThe vehicle handing is not very good, especially with the mouse and keyboard. Making turns with cars tends to feel like driving on ice even when it is not raining. I do not know how vehicles handle with a controller, but the vehicle handling leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nWhile I found Aiden’s personality and the vehicle handling disappointing, it does not mean it is a bad game. Watch_Dogs is still a good game with a plot that includes interesting characters such as Clara Lille and T-Bone. Jordi could have been more interesting with more screen time. Clara and T-Bone really help flesh out the story and keep it from being bland. The diverse ways of creative hacking in the game and the beautiful graphics portraying Chicago make this game worth your time.\n\nMy Score: 8/10\n","May 9","true","109.6"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","6"

Also as a hacker your able to hack peoples phone calls and texts, can lead to some pretty funny stuff, or some pretty cool equipment.\n\nThe controls feel good, after a few minutes of messing around I was running through the city parkouring and hacking like I had been doing it my whole life. The controls are completely customizable, but I haven't found a reason yet to change anything.\n\nPerformance is good, I am running everything on max settings, no frame drops, hiccups, or other irritating things.\n\nOnline mode is nice, so far I have had a couple of encounters and they all were entertaining, trying to chase down a player after he tried to hack me, or I in-turn having to hide because I tried to hack someone else, I ended up getting chased through the city and had to escape by boat.\n\nStory is decent I have not really gotten into it, I am still in the first chapter of the story (got sidetracked by all the cool stuff in freeroam) so far, the characters are enjoyable, the story itself is your typical revenge story, however, the writing and characters have made me feel deeply saddened one moment then cracking up the next, so along with freeroam the story completes the game and makes it extremely fun.\n\nIn freeroam there is a ton of stuff to do if your willing to take your time and enjoy it, I think you will love this game. There really isn't any downtime in freeroam, unless you ignore everything, there is either a crime going on or a contract or various other events that are happening in the city, and ctOS tells you about them and where to go do them. However sometimes you don't need ctOS to tell you, I was walking through a park heading towards a guy on his phone, going to listen to his call, when suddenly out of no where some guy starts shooting and then runs off with the shell game guys money, next thing I know I give chase, running through the park, streets and even a shop chasing this guy as he shoots at me (playing vigilante so I try not to shoot back) eventually I tackle the guy, hit him with my asp a few times, take the money he stole and walk back to the shop we ran through and buy some coffee, if you take your time and walk through the world, you will find it is quite alive.\n\nCons: I really only have a couple of cons here.\n\nDriving, the driving in this game is a little difficult to get used to, Aiden seems to have a led foot, because you tap the accelorator and the car peels out, tap the brake and your tires lock and you slide to a screeching halt, but after I got used to it I was drifting through the city like any other game, though I'm sure the original owners of the cars I steal dont care for how often I crash lol.\n\nThe last con isn't all that big of a deal, just a minor annoyance and that would be Uplay, having to download Uplay is slightly annoying but not a deal breaker for me.\n\n\n\nSo all in all I would give this game a 9/10, I deffinately recommend buying this game, get in-game, make a playlist, listen to music, start walking through the streets, hacking, shooting, driving and overall just enjoying freeroam at the very least.","July 29, 2015","true","25.1"," 35 of 48 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","35","48","0","2"

However sometimes you don't need ctOS to tell you, I was walking through a park heading towards a guy on his phone, going to listen to his call, when suddenly out of no where some guy starts shooting and then runs off with the shell game guys money, next thing I know I give chase, running through the park, streets and even a shop chasing this guy as he shoots at me (playing vigilante so I try not to shoot back) eventually I tackle the guy, hit him with my asp a few times, take the money he stole and walk back to the shop we ran through and buy some coffee, if you take your time and walk through the world, you will find it is quite alive.\n\nCons: I really only have a couple of cons here.\n\nDriving, the driving in this game is a little difficult to get used to, Aiden seems to have a led foot, because you tap the accelorator and the car peels out, tap the brake and your tires lock and you slide to a screeching halt, but after I got used to it I was drifting through the city like any other game, though I'm sure the original owners of the cars I steal dont care for how often I crash lol.\n\nThe last con isn't all that big of a deal, just a minor annoyance and that would be Uplay, having to download Uplay is slightly annoying but not a deal breaker for me.\n\n\n\nSo all in all I would give this game a 9/10, I deffinately recommend buying this game, get in-game, make a playlist, listen to music, start walking through the streets, hacking, shooting, driving and overall just enjoying freeroam at the very least.","July 29, 2015","true","25.1"," 35 of 48 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","35","48","0","2"

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS THE GAME BREAKING BUGS ARE FIXED !!\nPeople who finished the game are losing all their progress because of a bug. I also lost my savegame (all gear gone, clothes locked in default, can't use skills nor hack, can't play multiplayer, missions barely work, etc etc etc).\nIf you STILL want to try your luck, DISABLE online invasions and DO NOT play multiplayer!!\nUbisoft failed really bad this time. Shipping game breaking bugs is just absurd. The game cost me 75USD total.\nI play indie games that cost 5 USD that are way more polished than this in their Betas.\n\nAnd to clear things up beforehand, mind that I had no expectations or hype for this game. I was aware of it, but didn't really get into its hype-train and later bandwagon. I like Ubisoft games (Assassins Creed is my favorite franchise and I loved Far Cry 3), but I stand unbiased.\n\n- Review -\nOpening notes:\nDecent game with funny moments. Definetly not what most people expected.\nThe world feels like Assassins Creed worlds. The difference is that in AC, you are in the Animus reliving memories, therefore the world "can't" be alive, due to the people being AI representations made by the Animus.\nHowever, in Watch_Dogs you're supposed to be in the real world. It certainly does not feel like it, since the 'city life' is very repetitive and no matter how many times you go to a place, it will always be happening the same things with the same audio/lines (I lost count of how many times I killed that beatboxing guy near the west railway hideout. Seriously.)\n\n\nGameplay:\nThe missions and side missions are fun and, sometimes, interesting (and eventually feels repetitive). It doesn't justify the price tag. Maybe for 50% the price it would be worth getting the game.\nHacking does not feel so awesome, it's more like an utility. It IS fun to use your tools while engaging in multiplayer, but the failed connections, dropped connections and eventual bugs will get in the way.\nEventually you'll be bored of profiling everyone. It IS a very cool concept, getting info from people and knowing their last 'secret', but it adds nothing to the game.\nThe physics in the game is not as exagerated as on GTAIV, which is good, but the vehicles feel way too much resistant to impact sometimes.\nThere's also some funny moments when you intercept some calls or messages, or during "privacy invasion" missions.\n\nGraphics:\nAs my computer only fits the minimum specs, I can't comment on the graphics. But based on the trailers, I believe everyone expected more.\n\nSound:\nAudio is okay, but the musics on the midia app are largely ignorable.\nThe game's soundtrack (music played on missions) are good and fits the missions' mood most of the time. The problem is that those (sometimes unique) "mission music" most often go silent, which breaks immersion and brings up a very awkward moment.\n\nStory:\nMeh. Even though it has its cool or interesting moments, it won't fit anyone's expectations.\n\nConclusion:\nCould have been the game of the year, if not for the failed delivery, assorted bugs and game breaking bugs, and the open dead world that feels like an Animus 0.1 Alpha.\nThere's funny moments and references spread around on the side missions and collectibles, but still doesn't make up for the other issues.\nEven if its issues get fixed, its only a decent game at best. The hacking feature isn't really news..take Syndicate FPS game as an example. The multiplayer concept is good and I hope I get to see more of it in newer games.\n\nUPDATE: After finishing the game, I still stand by my first impressions - the game's not worth its full price.","June 1, 2014","false","50.6"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","5"

It stayed true to the Ubisoft development checklist which\n-Tons of collectables\n-Semi-decent story but still having its moments and good characters\n-Tons of side missions that can lead to cool items and weapons\n-slight parkour\n-And a cool gimmick (Hacking)\nIf you love Assissins Creed for its sort of open world Watch_Dogs is a perfect addition to your library. I can see why not everyone would enjoy this style because you don't really feel immerse in the environment because it all feels like a game. Another part of the game that I feel was a little underdeveloped were the police systems. While it was different and included ctOS stystem into it, it lacked difficulty in general. I greatly enjoyed their version of Chicago, it just was very enjoyaable to drive around in. Overall I would recomend this game to those who like the studio who made it or to open world fans. I wouldn't recomend it to those who are looking for something to take seriously and get into a story.","July 7, 2015","true","46.0"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","30","40","0","0"

This game has hate. I will grant you. When it first came out I jumped on the bandwagon and whinned about the graphics and so forth and how all the hype was a big let down. But then I got into the story and decided to play for a bit more. Then I played more.\n\nI might recieve hate for this, but Watchdogs, for me, was a near masterpiece. Everything from the characters to the story was just amazing. I don't know what people say about Aiden being a bland and dull character because he isn't. He is a character you can connect with. You see his sturggle to avenge those who have wronged him and you see how self-destructive that can be on him later in the game. He is a man with a goal and nothing will get in his way. I don't see how that is in anyway boring. What also makes him such a good character is how he opens up with chacters like T-bone and Clara later on in the game. He becomes conflicted with, in basic terms, whether his actions justify the means. Another thing that makes Aiden unique is why he wants revenge. Spoilers kinda.... His niece is killed and this I found to be really unique as it wasn't like he had a wife or child and they were killed. It emphisises that someone hurt people he cared about and that has caused him to seek revenge.\n\nThe story was very dark and very realistic. Well... realistic minus the CtOS system and hacking. Without spoiling too much, this is a game about secrets. Secrets and scandals and cover ups and we learn all of this throughout the game and how Aiden intends to uncover them all to get what he wants. The story seems to have this repeating idea about revenge and how it isn't worth it in the end. Without spoiling when Aiden finds out what he wants to find out, he then looks back on what he's done to get this far, the people he has hurt or killed, the lies he has told his family and lives he has ruined, and he then begins to have a internal dilemia with himself to again, ask whether or not what he did was worth it in the end and you'll understand why later in the story. This is where, for me anyway, the game really shined and made the player realise all they have done to get this far. It's hard hitting.\n\nCharacters were very good and dynamic. All of them didn't feel like they were a waste of space or unlikable. Even the villians. All of them were intriuging. T-bone was one of my personal favorite side characters. Although, whilst those who worked with Aiden received most of the light, his family were kinda left in the dark and because of their little screen time, I didn't really find myself all that connected with them as I would have liked too. Clara I think was one of the most important characters to the story, because she shows Aiden that he can rely on others to help him solve his problems and that they can work as a team. It's because of this that I really liked her, especially because it doesn't later turn into a lovey dovey relationship which, I think works between their characters. They both support and rely on each other which I found to be great character development for them both.\n\nGameplays pretty basic. You hack stuff. It's bloody amazing. Make stuff explode, steal money from homeless people and paitents with terminal illnesses and sex offenders. It's all great. Nothing really needs to be said more on that part. It's epic. I had so much fun and you will too. The detail in the game on the other hand, was really quite amazing. You can hack stuff and find out information about other peoples lives, read audio logs to find out about a persons backstory, hack into the CtOS videos and look into a persons home and see what they're doing (some of them are really funny.) Enemy AI is well done. They will move around, trying to flank you, hidning behind cover when you set of explosions and grenades. They will also be surprised to see if you have moved without them noticing you. God it's amazing. Guns are pretty good, they vary and you'll be using them for different situations when needed. Downside of them is that you'll never need anything other than your silanced pistol, which the game gives to you straight away. Headshots are easy even without focus but that doesn't necisserily mean that gameplay will get dull. You have to plan and coordinate where enemies are and try to avoid them as best you can. Aiden isn't a sponge to absorb bullets so it's advised you play stealth. Even though you'll find yourself taking down some of the early game enemies to begin with your Spec Ops 1911 (the silanced gun,) Snipers and especially Enforcers are a big threat as they mainly keep you behind cover as the other, weaker enemies advanced towards you without remorse. Side missions are fun though repetetive and the collectiables such as unlocking the CtOS towers are worth it. All in all. It's a great gaming experince. You'll clock in 30 hours minimum just doing the main story.\n\nNOW TO THE BAD STUFF:\n\nOk, so admittedly, there are problems with this game as there are with any game. So I'll list them.\n\n1. Driving. GOD IT SUCKS; If you're using a keyboard or controller, driving cars is one of the worst experiences you can have. If you lightly tap a fence, it shatters. Bump into a telephone pole and it falls down, and not just with cars, but with motorcycles aswell. This is very... whats the word... atmosphere breaking. You lose yourself in this game full of hacking and such and when something like that happens, it really shatters that feeling for you. On a side note. Only drive motorcycles. If you have to chose. Go bikes. They are faster, better to handle, manoeuvrable and so so so much fun. Get them. They are the only vehicle that doesn't feel like your driving a brick. Plus thier usually cheaper to buy.\n\n2. AI: Now. I got really annoyed with the AI pedestrians that roamed the streets of Chicargo. If you so much as inch towards them with a car or bike, you'll be hearing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and learn to drive so much that you'll go insane. They leap out of your way even when your not moving and this I found to be infuriating from a gameplay perspective. Also, I ♥♥♥♥ing hate the Blume informants. Hack them, they put a bounty on your head, to which other players will come into your game, and hack you. I enjoyed the experience and multiiplayer is fun but it was kinda inconviniate, especially if your like me and want to get on with the story.\n\n3. Hate. Yep. This is a problem with the game. The hate it gets. Im serious. I look at the comments now and I see how many people ♥♥♥♥ on this brillient game. It's frustrating especially when so many of them have barely reached past 10 hours. It's dissapointing. Look if your reading this now, and going by what people say about Uplay not login in and graphics stuff then don't. My computer is very average at the moment and I managed to get it up to high graphics. The game is good. It's better than good it's amazing. I'm sick of seeing people say things about this game that it doesn't deserve. Were we all disapointed at relase day? Yes. Were we all angry and the graphics downgrade to begin with? Yes. Did it run on most of our PCs? No. Does it deserve the hate because of it? NO. Guys, get passed all that and look at this game for what it is. I have been in the same situation as all of you and did not like this game because of it's faults. Now look at me, I'm writing a review on how outstanding this game turned out to be. Stop looking for reasons to say this game is bad. It's not.\n\nWell, yeah. This is my review. Thanks for reading. Please buy this game if your considering. It's worth it. If you're unsure then, I will agree, wait till it drops down in price and buy it then. Trust me. It's awesome.\n\n9/10: Much Watching.

Two weeks after release I'm no longer able to play the online content. I get disconnected from Ubisoft servers constantly. When I am able to play online I'm greeted with horendous lag. The support I've recieved concerning the online connectivity is comical. Apparently the problem is on my end. It must be, because I'm able to play numerous other games without any such issue?

Im actually begging you not to if your considering it, Ubisoft really screwed up on this one, it's not going to be hard to tell you why. If you don't want to read a book on the terrible things about this game skip to the bottom.\n\nThis game has been a utter dissapointment and waste of time right from the start, it dosen't live up to a single bit of it's hype. It's pretty much GTA or Saints row but take out everything that made those games fun and then make the protaganist boring as hell and useless and boom you have this game, press Q to get rich and make random stuff happen around you that dosen't actually mean anything. They could have done so much more with the hacking but they didn't, its just there, randomly you press Q, it dosent mean anything, it helps in car chases, but ultimatly hacking ♥♥♥♥ isen't going to help you at all, running and driving around is 85% of the game, yea i did that in GTA and saints row but at least it was fun in those games!\n\nGot a bad computer? Got a decent computer? If it isent a GTX titan with 16gbs of RAM, i7 core, running on SSD and you don't have a super good internet connection lmao good luck with this game buddy, it chugs like hell even with high setting for me and my rig is still pretty powerful, GTX 680 oc, stable internet, decent i5 core and 8Gbs of fast RAM and I can only run this game with medium textures, everything else on high not ultra and the anti aliasing down low and it still barely gets to 50 frames, it looks decent but that just ruined my experiance right from the get go becuase im a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ and the whole time im playing this im just wishing I could have the graphics on max, I don't think Ubisoft even know what optimization is.\n\nDon't even get me started on how awful the online gameplay is, it's useless and broken, it's a horrible experiance every time, I either can't find the hacker no matter where or look the hacker finds me like nothing, nobody knows what to do most of the time, nobody knows where to go, most of the time your just going to lose connection to the other player and end up with -nothing- so yea it's a total joke, don't even touch multiplayer unless you just want to waste more of your time in this lame excuse for an expensive AAA title.\n\nHave fun dieing alot as well, even on normal diffculty about 5 shots and your gone, boom dead, even with the armour upgrade on, so you can imagine how infuriatingly easy it is to die when you take on like 10 guys at once sometimes better armed then you with really good aim constantly flanking you, yea that's totally fun. Fall from a small height? oh yea dead apprently. Wanna use your enviroment to take out some guys like the devs make you so excited about? Well have fun with that because there is nothing effing around to help you when you need it, even Bioshock infinate did a way better job at that with tears.\n\nI wish I could say something good about this game I really do... but it's one of those game that sucks you in with hype and stuff that seems cool in your mind, steals your money and then tosses you a peice of junk that dosen't deliver what you thought it would. Ive played like what 20 hours so far? Still haven't been able to have much fun as much as ive been trying, there has only been tiny cool moments that barely make up for the endless frustration and bullcrap this game dishes out, I wanna stop playing but now I need to get my moneys worth out of it *sigh*\n\n\nI can only manage to give it a 4 out of 10, consistantly frustratingly awful, dull, unexciting, lacking features and inspiration, brings nothing to the table, dosent make you care, seems more repedative then other Ubi titles due to every side mission being so painful to get done, bad mouse control, bad game performance. Spend your money on something else and grab this game 'legit' if your curious, this will not be worth your time I promise you especially if you were hyped about it. Ubisoft, I am dissapoint, please for the love of god stick with ♥♥♥ creed, you don't even have much competetion in that area of game genre so you can't technically fail as bad as this.","May 30, 2014","false","32.2"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","25","34","0","6"

For the lofty heights the potentially awesome setting could deliver, the game feels mired in tropes, gameplay ideas and concepts thoroughly explored in the previous generation. Contrary to the fantastic trailers, most of your hacking skills are only useful in avoiding the cops, rather than opening up any interesting new gameplay ideas outside of that open-world staple. Darting around from camera to camera, raising cover and moving objects starts off as a cool concept in fighting arenas, but soon becomes tiresome, and it's often easier (and more enjoyable) to engage in a full frontal assault with the cacophony of guns and explosives given to you (the shooting is right up there with any other game, thankfully). It doesn't help that most of the game's missions usually follow one of those two structures. The supposedly emergent crime intervention feels horrifically contained, usually solved with a well-timed sprint towards the confrontation, or spending a minute or two running down a person down an open road.\n\nThe story, while starting strong with an engaging initial premise (the move to protect the broader family instead of a partner for Aiden makes is clever, considering the insular nature of an revenge-obsessed hacker), falls apart as the game progresses. Pacing is all over the place, and the game is in desperate need of a harsh edit; most missions seem to only exist in order to pad the game to the supposed open-world minimum length of 20 hours, and the game doesn't close half of the threads it opens. Characters are introduced and disposed on a whim, desperately lacking depth and adequate examination, and the game doesn't say nearly enough of worth around it's themes of interconnection, corporate control and trans-humanism.\n\nVisually, the game shines at night, creating a wonderful atmosphere in the rain-coated streets of a well-realised Chicago metropolis. Otherwise, the game looks fine, with good-looking animation and characters, even if the mid-west environments look a little bland and flat in the midday sun. Though I didn't run into any issues with it, loads of people say that the game runs like absolute balls on their PCs, which is something to be aware of if you’re looking to purchase the game through Steam/uPlay.\n\nIf you're looking for just another open world game in the vein of a Grand Theft Auto, you'll find even more of it inside Watch Dogs. Manage your expectations, and you'll probably have a pretty good time. But there's promise for something fresh and exciting here, and it's pretty disappointing to have it do so little with an awesome premise and impressive technology. Hopefully the inevitable sequel will do a better job.","June 4, 2014","false","24.2"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","23","31","0","1"

The hacking is so entertaining, and pretty dramatic when you do some amazing tricks.  Story is pretty good, too.  Graphics are awesome to gaze at (with TheWorse mod or Kadzait24)\n\nI wanted to recommend this game so badly, but I couldn't.\n\nI was SO hyped for this game.  I would watch the E3 2012 gameplay, the premiere demo, and every video released.  It was very dissapointing that the graphics were downgraded, but even more when I got the game and saw it with my own eyes.  Chicago is still beautiful with the graphics mods that you can get.\n\nAs for the gameplay...\nTons fo fun when you start, until you realize that it's the same thing over and over again...  Ubisoft could have made this much more diverse and exciting if they put more time and didn't rush their missions, even after a terribly long delay that honestly was not worth the wait.\n\nNot only were the graphics downgraded, the gameplay was as well.  If you watch the E3 2012 gameplay, you can already see the features that were taken away.  Civilians helping others, the surrendering (which doesn't work after you finish the story), and so much more.  I want to know why Ubisoft would take away from the gameplay...\n\nUplay is trash by the way,\n\nIf you don't mind the repetitive gameplay, get this game, it's amazing.  It you, like me, do get annoyed at the repetitive missions, and have been hyping for this game ever since it was announced, don't get it.  WAY overhyped and is a marketing machine that tricked us into buying this not-so-spectacular game unlike what we saw in 2012.\nRating: 5.5/10","July 14, 2014","false","230.3"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","23","31","0","0"

But did it live up to the hype?\n\nHell no, being developed by EvilSoft, It sure delivered it's "quality" to it: Ubi Formula gameplay(Unlocking Towers, overcasualed gameplay, botchered character progression and unlocks), rushed feel of a game overall, optimisation, driving physics, hacking could be more varied.\n\nBut on another hand - totally unique soundtracks that reminded me Deus Ex, animations fluidity, atmosphere of Chicago and it's detail, raining feels like raining, and I mean even GTA V doesn't come close imo, overall story of Vigilante, you get to know what happened with Aiden, and why he became what he is - silent guy with overcoat(many said he's boring, but if you think he is, you didn't paid attention to the story at all), his emotions come through body language, he looks very intimidating with a gun in a hand, and that just shows his agression and will to fight the crime - the enemy that caused his loss.\n\nI say it's good Ubisoft game, for their standard, but average in terms of other AAA games, I'm sure it could be better, it could have Rockstar attention to detail, but game feels just rushed, too bad, because concept is too good.\nBut maybe it's their first try, who knows what WD 2 will brings us, E3 2012 detail, perhaps?

Many people have been giving this game negative reviews but i am currently loving it. I am aware of the fact that some people are suffering constant crashes and bad frame rates but I am having none of these. I find the storyline rich and in depth and I love the hacking in it.\nOnce patches have been released fully optimising this game for AMD cards/prossecors then I think that the people who brought the game and it hasn't worked for will really enjoy it.\nMy personal opinion on this game is that it is an amazing work of art and i find that the way that every civilian has a story and how you can hack into their life is just great. I also love the guns and the mechanics behind them, you can tell alot of thought and detail has been put into making each gun just right and not too overpowered. The AI in the game are very iteractive and smart which is nice to see because in most open world games every civilian is the same. I have also have had some very funny moment on the game where I hacked someones phone and ended up reading a message which said: "I spread my bumcheaks infront of the child." (check my screen shots)\nI find it a real shame that you have to launch the game through U-play because I strongly dislike the U-play interface and the way the cloud stroage works and the fact that because I brought the game through steam I expect to be able to launch it through steam.\nIn conclusion, I have found this game amazing but it's a real shame it hasen't worked for everyone and hopfully ubisoft will notice this and release a patch soon.\nUPDATE: Well i thought this game was good untill I lost all of my save files 2x. All of my progress has gone and I am really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about it.

Ubisoft is still working on a patch to iron out those problems. However, if you're lucky like me and can run the game on ultra without any stuttering or lag, it's quite amazing. The game is gorgeous looking, the water textures (obviously inspired by Assasins Creed) is great. Chicago looks very much alive and captures the city very well. The story is about Aiden Pierce, a hacker. His niece is killed and he seeks revenge. Even though the story is flat it kept me playing. I mean why does Aiden kill a bunch of civillians and causes chaos in the city if he is suppose to be a hero? It doesn't really make sense. It feels like Aiden causes way more trouble then the actual gangs and mob does. For me it's not a big problem but for the people that expected Aiden to be a hero, this might be a big disappointment. Driving is my biggest problem in the game and the lack of melee combat. The driving physics is not realistic and smashing into someones car doesn't give you that satisfying feel as in gta. Multiplayer hacking and racing is really fun and innovative. Chicago have a ton of side activities to do like chess, digital trips, gang hideouts and racing. The voice acting is really good in Watch Dogs and all characters is fun in some way, thats probably what made the story interesting even though the plot falls flat. Watch Dogs will probably get a sequel and if they improve the driving until then and add things like a melee system, I think It can be really good. Just look at Assasins Creed 1 and 2, the second game is much more fun and improved in almost every way. Hopefully thats the future for Watch Dogs too. For now the game is good, but not great. I would still recommend you too pick it up if you can run it on your machine!","June 11, 2014","true","103.5"," 40 of 64 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","40","64","0","5"

So far I am not too far in to the story, so I can't really say it is in any way gripping, but it has me semi engaged, but nothing major. Gameplay seems like a cross between GTA meets Assassins Creed meets hacking by pressing X. It does none of those particularly well, but it keeps you satisfied enough for a while.\n\nMissions seems repetitive and a copy paste of each other, with no more changes than the dialoge going on the background. Usual recipe is start by sneaking in to place, end up being discovered and fight some enemies. Usually the last part say fight or escape, but my experience is the easiest thing is to fight until you have thinned their ranks enough to be able to sneak out. There are slight variances, like all together sneaking\n\nWhile I can understand the rage of people getting it at release, at full price, it is still a somewhat playable game. It is in all aspects average, but is still worth a buy if you get it cheap enough.","March 9, 2015","true","25.9"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","18","24","0","0"

Instant boner kill, nothing I hate more than the Uplay client, although its not too bad when you know, you can actually log in.\n\nWatch_Dogs had a massive hype train, and the graphics we were promised looked incredible. The concept of being able to hack your surrounding environment sounded amazing taking player/surroundings interactivity to a new level. (No, i'm not going to scream LEVELUTION!!!11!)\n\nHowever two hours into the game you realise very quickly that you've exhausted the hacking diversity of the game. Hackable entities are far more limited than expected and grow extremely repetative. There's only so many times that its funny to make Blockers arise from the ground like you're a ♥♥♥♥ing wizard (harry) to destroy the hilariously naive policeman chasing you.\n\nAnd the driving, holy ♥♥♥♥ the driving is terrible. None of the cars have any traction whatsoever and you aren't able to shoot from your car as one would expect, resulting in a fairly bland experience when in a car chase. There isnt an awful lot of intensity chasing a high value targer when neither you nor them can fire at each other, leaving you to rely purely on hacking exploitations, giving you the limited choice of eliminating your target by:\n\n- Traffic Jam\n- Blockers\n- Steam Pipe (Explosion)\n\nThe combat system is nothing special, yet has some interesting elements. Red Dead Redemption managed to spice up its combat system with Dead eye, New Vegas gave combat the edge with Vats, Skyrim offered a selection of Kill Moves, as well as unique Magic / Shouts. Watch_Dogs's unique combat mechanic is that you are sometimes able to hack objects on enemies to your advantage. For example you can distract them with Text Messages to sneak past, activate explosive devices on their belts, or even cause a blackout which will allow you get up close and personal with your unsuspecting foe. Yet all in all, every Watch_Dogs firefight is the same, copy and paste. Same ♥♥♥♥, different location.\n\nThe story had a promising start. However the pinacle of the games excitement was reached too quickly, and one certainly feels like they hadn't thought too much about the plot after the first hour. The protagonist, Aiden Pearce is a very uninteresting character. He comes across as just your classic "detective" type, who has decided to take on the world because ♥♥♥♥ you. If you like domestic issues and family sob stories, then maybe you'll get a kick out of the campaign, but otherwise, meh. I stand by the suspision that they seriously didn't think ahead with the plot.\n\nThe only thing that I really do think is perfect in Watch_Dogs, is the Digital Trips feature. These Digital Trips are like mini-games, except each individual trip is like a game in itself. Every single one is heaps of fun, and arguably more fun than the original game. One involves you comandeering a ♥♥♥♥ing Spider Tank that has gatling guns, rockets, and can climb up the sides of buildings. If that doesnt get you horny then you're no child of mine.\n\nI feel like Watch_Dogs needed another year or two to polish up. Slow and steady would very possibly have won the race.\n\nWould happily pay 20 quid for the experience as aspects of it have been fun. But 40?

Firsly, this requires you to use uPlay. uPlay recently made a change requiring emails to login, but if you're a long time user like me, who used a username and did not have an email set, you have to call support to get it fixed. -1\n\nAfter that irksome portion (Support was good, actually, so +1 to the employees, not the company though), I got into the game. After setting it to use my eyefinity setup, I noticed things were super zoomed in.

Thankfully with Flawless widescreen you can unlock it, but the HUD is still messed up. -1 for lack of super widescreen support.\n\nAfter that, I decided to play it. I walk outside, and get into the car for the first mission. My AMD Phenom x4 at 3.4 GHz and HD 7970 could not handle driving at ultra, dropping down to 5 fps, so I turned it down to Low.

It seems most BSOD issues seem to be a problem with AMD cards.  AMD released a driver update that worked around this, and now I can play.\n\nThere is no two ways about it, this game was massively overhyped.  Most of the graphical fidelity that you saw on the demonstrations and teasers is gone.  The graphics aren't bad, but not as good as I, and everyone else was expecting.  The performance is terrible.  My machine is a high end gaming rig, but even on medium settings, there are huge frame rate drops, at busy times, like car chases, as low as less than one frame a second!\n\nOther than this, the game is actually average to okay.  Lots of variety, a novel game mechanic (but this gets old quickly)...\n\nWait until the game is playable and the price drops before buying it!","May 27, 2014","false","3.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

As a Chicagoan seeing all of the trailers and the view of the skyline from Millenium Park (in-game), I expected a realistic map of Chicago. Besides the view from Millenium Park, nothing is the same as the real city. The game places Chicago on a few small islands with mountains all around it besides the one suburb in the game. The suburb (I can't remember what its called) is much too country-ish considering the Chicago area's urban crawl radiates from the city. There aren't mountains anywhere near Chicago, either. The game's "South Side" isn't really a spectacle, either.\n\nAs many other people have pointed out, the graphics didn't live up to their hype either. The skyscrapers should be casting long shadows over the streets, but instead, the sun shines over the whole city! At E3, Ubisoft presented remarkable graphics and shaders.\n\nOther than that, the game lacked features that many people call essential. For one thing, there is only one save slot, and within that save slot is both your data for offline AND online play. This means that you could have maxed out everything in both, and upon restarting the campaign, you lose all of your online progress as well. You also cannot replay missions without going through the entire rest of the campaign again. Additionally, there is no console or modding ablility to resolve the game's issues.\n\nAs an added bonus, the campaign is exceptionally... short. Once again, the advertising was misleading. I expected a long story about cracking down on human trafficking and illegal drug use, but instead it follows a guy killing everyone in his path to avenge his family's murder. The side missions are all cookie-cutter copies of the same thing in different locations around the city, and they all provide similar benefits. Earning money is incredibly easy in this game, too. Just walk up to someone, hack their bank account with just a few short clicks, then collect their money from the nearby ATM. There are no downsides to this, unfortunately. The CPD and Blume don't have any way to track you down, so you get away with it every time.\n\nNow, I might as well list some of the positives. The Chicago Police Department is relentless, and their use of CtOS allows them to track you across the city. For this reason, you must have a fast car. However, if you want a quick getaway, just steal a boat and sail out into the middle of Lake Michigan. You'd think a port city would have police boats, but they don't. The hacking puzzles were fun as well. I wish there were more of them in the game. Finally, there are some parts of the map that provide pretty, scenic views. The campaign missions, despite the shallow story, were pretty fun as well. I especially liked hacking CtOS substations and sneaking out of Cellular Field.\n\nIn conclusion, the game was fun, but lacked many things that could have made it worth buying such as a realistic map, the E3 graphics, a better story, multiple save slots, and moddability. While Ubisoft did a good job at implementing unique gameplay elements, they could have done a lot more with it. If I were you, I'd wait for the PC release of GTA V in 2015.","November 22, 2014","false","41.3"," 36 of 58 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","36","58","0","0"

The game is diverse, fun and there is always something to do. In the same manner as Grand Theft Auto (GTA) games allow you to just spend some time to free-roam without doing anything at all, Watch_Dogs (WD) allows you to do the same thing.\n\nI am playing on a QuadCore Q9400 @ 2.66 GHz, 8 GB RAM and a GeForce GTX 650 1 GB. I get good, constant 50+ FPS at 1920x1080 resolution with mostly medium settings which make the game look better than GTA.\n\nWhile the story is a typical cliché of disgruntled ex-business partners, loss of a loved one, a hostage situation, and fighting big corporations, it is tackled from a new angle. The usual gang-mentality I'm not all that fond of in the GTA games does make an appearance, but not as bad. There are definitely a number of twists I was not expecting, including the death of a character I was absolutely not prepared for. Given the overall mess Aiden Pearce finds himself in, I do not find him lacking in personality at all. This is a man who literally has most odds against him, is coming to terms with guilt, a huge loss, and is trying to figure out who he can trust. I'd be emotionally as shut down as I could, too, in such a situation; how else would you cope?\n\nGameplay wise I can definitely see elements of Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell, the Batman Arkham franchise, Max Payne and of course GTA. It works well together though, and all the elements are well implemented and the flow is fluent. They also definitely did a great job at bringing Chicago to life!\n\nThere are some real gems hidden in the game, references to other games, funny or otherwise and there were a number of moments that had me laugh out loud. If you are hacking into a ctOS facility or into servers at your base of operations later on, you can watch some observation video footage that ranges from hillarious to truly 'wtf??!' Do not miss that.\n\nOnce the campaign is completed, you can still carry on and complete the outstanding side missions and play online, too.\n\nI have now started the Bad Blood DLC and so far T-Bone proves a fun character, that definitely doesn't waste time expelling cynical remarks that are definitely on line with my sense of humor. Some mechanics are different, and he works together with CPD (definitely a refreshing surprise), so ultimately, if you liked Watch_Dogs, do definitely get the Season Pass. It's worth it.\n\nWatch_Dogs is a solid game, and so far I do not see that Ubisoft promised anything they did not keep. I am not going to argue about graphics quality or whether it was downgraded. All of the initial reviews that are responsible for giving this game such a bad score on Steam were complaining about bad performance. What would the performance have been like on even higher settings? I get good performance with reasonable settings on my current rig (far from the latest hardware, I'm well aware of this), so I have no complaints in that regard. If you have the latest and greatest in computer hardware, and this game performs badly, maybe do some maintenance on your rig, update the drivers, but either way, it's not the game's fault.","November 2, 2014","true","80.5"," 72 of 125 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","72","125","0","0"

Vehicle steering is a ♥♥♥♥♥, things can get repetitive, doesn't live up to the hype (as long as you weren't hyped, it's no biggie), but it's still a bargain during sale. I cannot talk for those without hotshot 1337 noscope computers, but for me it worked fine (even when using 8-9 GB ram after playing for 12 hours).\n\nI've had tons of fun playing this game, although I only played it for one (full) day. I found the side missions to be interesting. Before I even immersed myself in the story, I went around to hack people, check out their lives, maybe kill someone I don't like. Then I found a poker game in a basement, and thought: "Hey, why not?" Three rounds in, two of the guys went all in, and I couldn't be a ♥♥♥♥♥ so I too bet all my money, and guess who won? That was a fun hour.\n\nBut the most fun is all the invasions from other players. In-game there is an option to play different online games, and one of those is to hack another player, 1v1. This player doesn't know you're in his/her game until it's too late and you've begun hacking. This starts a download sequence, that takes several minutes, while also pinpointing your location to a circle on the map. This allows the other player to search for and ID you using the cellphone, and kill you. The game offers good hiding methods, so this can be really fun. It's also very fun to be on the opposite side. You're doing your usual, for example playing Shell at a street gambler, when the screen tells you you're being invaded. It can happen almost any time, which makes it very fun. I recently had a long car chase, which concluded by me shooting the other player's brains out.\n\n9/11, would hack again","June 21, 2015","true","20.5"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

I don't get why so many people bash on this game, the attention to detail is evident when free roaming.

There are a few frame drops, ESPECIALLY DURING THE LAST MISSION, (I had to lower my graphics down to low in order to complete it) but throughout most of the campaign they are minor.\nThe world has a LOT to do in it, if you really want to get the whole experience play all the side missions. My play style revolves around being really stealthy and being the tactical ninja so the perfect weapon in my eyes is the Spec-Ops Goblin which you can only receive by doing the side missions.\nOverall...it's a fairly good game, the port really hurts the experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElusiveOne/recommended/243470/","ElusiveOne","ElusiveOne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElusiveOne/","71 products in account","Watch_Dogs is a flawed, unpolished gem that shows as much promise for its next iteration as unfulfilled potential in its current incarnation. Feeling very much like a work in progress with its technical hiccups and underdeveloped design, it is nevertheless replete with enough imaginative concepts to make it worthy and entertaining.\n\nIts story missions build up in intensifying moments, especially towards the end game. Useful upgrade options are presented in clean UI that gives the game a stylish yet sober presentation. Competent shooting mechanics and a good diversity of weapons and gadgets make the fights engaging enough. Hacking people and the city is tons of fun and never gets old, particularly with hilarious DedSec videos!\n\nDigital Trips are fun unrelated additions that could be the basis of decent standalone budget games. I wish Watch_Dogs had more of these great diversions and less of the mundane cash runs and betting mini games. While aplenty, other side missions don't quite make sense in the context of the story and they almost invariably play out the same way.\n\nThe game's main character does come out a bit hollow, making it difficult to easily support his motives – Aiden Pearce rightfully deserves the mess he dug for himself. He believes he's the good guy but he comfortably hurts hundreds of people, not all of them dangerous criminals. For instance, he'll violently batter thugs who steal wallets but hacks virtually everyone's bank account in the same beat. The game does acknowledge his conflicting methods later on, which makes it somewhat more sustainable.\n\nWatch_Dogs' version of Chicago is a fun place to explore as a whole though its rare shops offer very few interesting propositions. The best guns are handed out for free or obtained through missions and you'll never run out of bullets. The other shops mostly just sell sandwiches and coffee or nearly identical sets of clothes that no one else wears. Players don't have to buy cars or homes or anything really, so making money is easy but without anything worthwhile to spend it on you'll be a useless millionnaire before the end credits.\n\nThe city is a great playground, yet feels very unnatural at times. Citizens overreact too strangely to garage doors opening, whereas they won't budge if you come at their vehicles in a firetruck, sirens blaring. Civilians literally throw themselves at your vehicle during chases. The good bits include various humorous situations you can witness throughout the city, such as a guy getting his stuff thrown on the sidewalk by his enraged girlfriend, that bring life to the city. It is also pretty nice to look at in general.\n\nWhile ctOS prides itself in being a state of the art security system, you can break ♥♥♥♥ up in the city and the police never shows up unless you're playing a mission that specifically demands it. Once they do show up, cops are complete idiots who will shoot directly into crowds in the off chance a bullet might graze you.\n\nThe better game mechanics would presumably let you complete missions in perfect stealth by causing fake accidents. However this premise completely breaks the minute you indirectly attack an enemy vehicle (blowing a steam pipe, for instance) as they instantly know your exact location even when you hacked it remotely from three blocks away.\n\nOnline Invasions can be annoying in difficult to defend dense urban areas. However, they also provide a sudden rush of adrenaline and excitement since they create very unpredictable moments with the one other human player in your environment. They're among the best and freshest ideas this game brings to the genre.\n\nOther annoyances include clunky car controls and poor camera work, huge framerate drops even on recommended settings, and overly sticky cover mechanic. It is impossible to replay completed missions except the lesser city games. Also, the unimpressive licensed soundtrack left me skipping songs more than half the time, though the performance talent, sound effects and music composed specifically for the game are uniformly solid.\n\nDespite the obvious number of imperfections, I did spend 60+ hours in the game and definitely enjoyed most of it. Here's hoping its sequel will be an equally impressive step forward that will take this series from good to great.","April 20","true","62.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rannmann/recommended/243470/","rannmann","[FP] rann","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rannmann/","332 products in account","Watch_Dogs had a rough launch.  The first day two days it was nearly (or entirely) unplayable due to "Uplay" being offline or slow due to the heavy traffic.  But since then, I haven't seen any Uplay-specific issues.\n\nI'm not really sure why this game is offered through Steam at all, since there are 0 Steam features.  Your friends list can't sync to Uplay, there are no Steam achievements, and the Watch_Dogs launcher just launches Uplay.  "Yo dawg, we heard you like DRM, so we put DRM in your DRM so you double your downtime."  I thought I'd be able to easily play against my Steam friends and sneak into their game, but so far I've only been able to hack into random user's games.\n\nThat said, when the game is working it's quite fun.  Maybe not as cool as all the hype leading up to it, but it's still worthwhile if you're into a GTA-style hacking game.  You can progress your character towards good or evil, which I imagine is a fun dynamic (I've only gone towards vigilante, so I can't say much about that).  The more criminals you help stop, the less likely people are to call you in to the cops.  I've plowed down a dozen civilians while chasing someone down and never saw a cop once.\n\nDriving is very forgiving.  You can jump a motorcycle off a building, break through a phone booth and smash into a brick wall without falling off or taking any damage.  Handling is very pleasant on the PC version, and sometimes I find myself driving as fast as I can weaving through traffic just because it's so much fun.\n\nThere's quite a few mini-games that are quite literally insane.  Like, acid-trip bouncing-on-flowers and over buildings... it seems a bit out of place, but it's a fun diversion from the regular gameplay.\n\nCombat is great because you can play stealthy--taking over an enemy compound without being seen at all--or guns blazing.  I wish there was more opportunities to fully complete missions via hacking, but it's designed to be more of an aid than a full solution.  Generally you can take out about 30% of guards in any location before you have to enter.\n\nI really hope this game is opened up to the modding community at some point, because there is a huge amount of potential.  It's fun on its own, but man, there could be SO MUCH MORE!\n\n(updated 6/12) One note about saved games: The game utilizes an auto-save features that doesn't allow you to do manual saves.  These get synced to Uplay automatically.  There's currently an issue that breaks saved games and prevents them from loading past 90%.  You have to remove your game save files and play offline in order to actually load anything, which removes about half the game's features.  As someone who was working on every side mission and achievement, I've been waiting for over a week for a fix because I don't want to redo 36 hours of play time.  No updates yet, still can't launch the game.  A lot of users are affected and developers have no idea why this happens.\n\nOverall: 7/10.  Minus two points for Uplay and other bugs breaking most people's experiences.  Minus one point for fairly weak "hacking" (although on a console it's about all you can hope for).","May 28, 2014","true","207.9"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Ubisoft completely lost me with this burning pile of kaka... and i've played all the way through Assasins Creed 3. I couldn't even finish Watch_Dogs. That's how bad it is. Lets start with the graphics. The PC version was toned down considerably so that Watch_Dogs would look on par with the new generation consoles. So basically it looks like a dried dog turd. There's a mod you can get which unlocks its full potential graphics wise.. but you shouldn't have to do that in the first place. I did, it did not affect performance in the slightest so dont be listening to Ubisoft spouting off those lies about it looking lame because of 'performance issues.' The game has performance issues with or without high settings. Driving around the city is a nightmare. Driving in that game at all is a ♥♥♥♥ing nightmare. You get such bogus frame rates when you're driving around. It is just a horribly optimized game.\n\nNow... lets get into the characters and the dialogue and the boring ♥♥♥ story. It's allll boring! The main character is more boring then ♥♥♥♥ing Conner from Assassins Creed 3... NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL A BORE! I guess he thinks he's batman cause he's always using Christian Bale batman voice or he smokes/eats 5 packs of cigs a day. It's a typical uninspired revenge story with a flat emotionless character. Whatever....\n\nHackin' the world... or... not really. Lets get into that. When Watch_Dogs was first shown to the world, it promised an entire city you could hack. You could hack EVERYTHING and doing this ♥♥♥♥ had consequences and benefits... but when the full game came out it wasn't really like that. Sure you could hack a street light and lift a bridge or something but there wasn't much to it. You press a button and one or two things happen. There isn't much depth to it or variety, and there is NO consequence. You could steal money from cancer patients, college students, war veterans, and nothing bad comes of it. There is no morality system as was originally promised. So there's no reason to just not steal money from people without looking at who they are or how much money they even have. Just take it. Nobody cares. There is an infamy meter. But it only effects you if you're killing cops or civilians, then people will call the cops on you more if you accidently take out your gun or something.\n\nTo be honest I could go on forever about how much I hate this game and why I hate it. Not to mention that when it first came out I had a loading bug that prevented me from playing the game for a month. That probably didn't help my opinion. But one thing I know for certain is that I absolutely despise the music in the game. I don't know what dumb idiot they got to pick out the songs for it, but every time I got into a car I had to switch the radio off immediately. Then when I got out of the car I had to listen to a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s doing really bad rap music. This game truely makes Chicago looks like a Hell hole. I have never been to Chicago.. but i'd probably kill myself if I had to live in Watch_Dogs version of Chicago.\n\nI'm gonna wrap this up. This review is starting to become a maniacal rant. The game sucks. End of story. You're just gonna have to take my word for it. If you have a specific question about why the game is a piece of trash then feel free to ask me and i'll elaborate why it's horrible. I would never watch those dogs ever again. Bunch of stupid boxer dogs is what they are. Or or uh.. cheewawaas. This game is like having to watch a bunch of small annoying dogs all day and pickin' up their poo poo and barf and whatever. Every horrible breed of dog you can think of. That's this game. Watch_Dogs?

I'm sure Ubisoft is so over the GTA comparisons but really, it is the best frame of reference especially when attempting to recommend the game.  Imagine a near future where everything in your city is linked to a central surveillance system and THEN imagine you're in Chicago--that's Watch_Dogs.  Y'know the map in GTA IV?  Imagine that city map, except instead of trying to mimic New York, it's Chicago.  Now imagine a virtual TON of content littered across that map (that consists of something like five six "islands" or burroughs).  But wait, dream yourself into the role of the city's protector, a bonafide "Batman Vigilante" without the cape and cowl, recall the map, and then you have Watch_Dogs in a nutshell.\n\nDo you lke hacking?  Then you'll probably like this game.  No, it's not real hacking BUT the hacking consists of little puzzles and non(well, not always)-lethal tactics to use against your enemies.  Do you like stealth?  Then you'll like this game.  I've only played it on normal but I would assume it will only get better as the difficulty increases.  In stealth and in all out open combat, the cover system works.  That's a big deal.  The shooting is wonky cuz third person but... Y'know, that's the price we pay for the immersive, expansive, OCD inducing overall experience.  Don't rely on shooting (even in PVP--yes, there is PVP AND it totally works, effortless implementation).\n\nIs there a story?  Well, it's a vengeance tale... Aiden Pearce utters the words: "I need to know WHY", in Act I.  Does that sum it up?  Because it really should.  Have I finished the game?  No.  What?  I don't understand the question.  Irrelevant.\n\nSo like, it's GTA except you're a gruff, unshaven vigilante fighting a corrupt city with a lot of Big Brother aspirations.  You can literally ignore the single player campaign and get lost in this game fighting/stopping crimes and spying on people and investigating weird ♥♥♥♥ and stealing cars and then this guy just straight up executed someone right in front of you and now you're chasing him down... I'm sure the story is servicable but honestly I don't give a rat's ♥♥♥ since I already got my money's worth doing optional side shtuff.\n\nYeah, there is uPlay.  It sucks.  Adds nothing.  Luckily, also doesn't negatively impact the game either.  It launches and then it disappears.  I would suggest running the game on "high" settings, rather than "ultra", since it stutters SO BADLY otherwise.  Car chases are impossible due to the stuttering--bad.  If you're running a major rig with SLI or Crossfire, you MIGHT be able to ignore this advice but I've seen stuff in the forums about the game not recognizing those kinds of hardware setups so tweak/demand at your own risk.  Currently, I'm running the game smoothly with an AMD HD7950, 1920x1200, borderless window (available from MENU!), and stuff with stuff and anti-aliasing.  It runs smooth and looks great--also, the ambient music is great!  Yes, there is actual music that will play on the car radio, by real bands, but it's not Vice City good or anything.  The actual score of the game is really good though, reminiscent of Mass Effect, in fact.\n\nSo think of a sci-fi version of GTA IV and you have Watch_Dogs.  Does that idea appeal to you?  Maybe?  Read everything above this line to help guide your decision.  Note:  I am playing with a PS4 controller (and emulators).","August 8, 2015","true","72.6"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","18","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freyar/recommended/243470/","freyar","Freyar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freyar/","1188 products in account","Watch_Dogs is a game that came along with the intent to usher in the "next generation" on consoles. While it does well visually in some cases, it doesn't really feel like Watch_Dogs manages to keep itself up to where it was promised.\n\nYou play as Aiden Pearce, a vigilante (or criminal) with ties to crews that operate online. With a little bit of work you start taking over systems that let you play with the city as you please. Cause an accident by setting all the lights at an intersection green. Cause a pipe under a road to burst, destroy transformers and so on by overloading them to knock out power and give you an opportunity to get away in darkness.\n\nWhile all nice on paper, the true implementation is flawed in a number of key areas. Crashes when messing with a traffic light feels fake as all cars stopped accelerate on a dime and stupidly hit each other (rather than having something appear more natural). Driving in itself is of an arcade variety and with years of physics-based driving due to most modern games it takes a LOT to get used to.  UPlay services are completely unstable right now, and what's worse the adversarial modes can be unstable as well or downright unfair.\n\nVisually the game has two polar opposites. It looks stunning at night and in the rain with detailed reflections and a great number of post-processing effects. During the day, the game looks pretty lackluster. Without the shine and lighting from rain and night, surfaces look on par with other "last gen" games. There is just something "missing" to make it look complete, be it fog or otherwise.\n\nAll this aside, performance issues in all areas are pretty notable. Drops are very noticeable during driving which is crucial since the controls are so frustrating. Drops also seem to happen during a time change and any other particular thing that may cause something to have to be loaded in memory.  Despite the claim that a CPU like an i7-3770k and a GTX 670 being able to run Ultra, these stutters are pretty aggravating as they're just on the line between wanting to stop because of it but continuing in hopes they won't come back.\n\nMultiplayer is alright and shines exceedingly well in tailing and adversarial hacking. The other modes suffer from a huge amount of lag compounded by the open conflict nature of racing and decryption. You will likely find yourself being killed often before managing to spawn in to the match adding in yet more loading time (this problem was present even with an SSD). Latency in combination with shooting, slower movement than other games tends to make the open conflict matches to be far less than fun.\n\nThe radar in multiplayer makes zero sense as to why or how someone is supposed to be detected, cars started failing to actually be driveable yet remain untouched until you tried and there was a point at which controls became stuck, Aiden only capable of running towards the camera and after that was only able to reverse in any car. These kinds of issues are just absurd to have gotten through.\n\nThe ctOS companion challenge is interesting, but ultimately seems to have a huge number of issues with connectivity. In the attempts made, only one player was actively engaged but that player looked to be behind by over 30 seconds which resulted in his attempts to stop to be way too late. Losses were a result of failing navigation more than actual interference and ultimately had the same feeling as every other adversarial game mode.\n\nOne-on-One Hacking and Tailing is absolutely wonderful. The stress building up as you're being watched or hacked is scaled quite well, with decisions becoming more vital the further along the match goes. Do you start mowing down civilians? Do you fire a few shots to scare them off and see who doesn't react?  The cat-and-mouse game is such a wonderful addition and that breaks up single-player. I find myself wishing invasions were more frequent as well as getting into another game much more reliable.\n\nWatch_Dogs is a game I really want to be able to like, but with it's online components crippled and unstable, critical issues with controls in multiplayer matches and strange driving mechanics it would be better to wait until after UPlay gets it's act together and Watch_Dogs has a few fixes under its belt.","May 28, 2014","false","33.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

You are Aiden Pearce, a security expert who is seeking revenge, justice and redemption for something that went wrong in your life not too far long ago. Along your journey you will meet new people and uncover new intel which involves you with something bigger than you originally intended.\n\nWelcome to Chicago. Watch_Dogs features a digital carbon copy of Chicago, Illinois where streets, buildings and landmarks are accurately imagined in-game. Your weapon of choice? The Smartphone. And this is what makes the game super fun. You can use your smartphone to profile random npc's walking down the street, hack street lights to cause traffic to pile up and other things that will help you achieve objectives or help you escape. Yes, there are guns as well. Lots of them. From pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles and grenade launchers. Or you can go stealth, using cover, your phone and not kill anyone but just sneak through to complete your objectives.\n\nBack to hacking, the whole security aspect of the game isn't just neat, it's amazing and very well drawn out, you can hack cameras, tv's, ATM machines, other people's phones, credit cards, cashier machines, radios, bridges, trains, ect. It's probably the coolest thing about this game. You choose whether to do this for fun or to help you to achieve your goals.\n\nYoull be happy to know that the story is actually pretty decent, the campaign is longer than other open-world games we've become accustomed to. The characters are not bright and fun but rejects who are quite depeessing and dark like Aiden. There's not really any comedy here like you might find in Saints Row or Grand Theft Auto series. Watch Dogs takes itself very seriously. Maybe a little too seriously sometimes but I like that.\n\nPros  Digital recreation of Chicago, Illinois is stunningly accurate\nLengthy single player campaign\nCompanion mobile app enables you to hack into or challenge other people while you aren't in game\nFull controller support\nCons  Limited Multiplayer Options\nNo planes, helicopters or tanks you can drive or pilot\nLimited variety of npc and car models when compared to other games of the genre\nDidn't quite live up to the promise of what Ubisoft promised at E3 when they first showed the game\nFinal thoughts:\nOverall, the single player campaign is the best thing about this game and with good reason. Although Ubisoft did not bring it anywhere near it's full potential, it is a fine alternative to Grand Theft Auto and Sleeping Dogs.\n\nRating (8.6 out of 10)\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","May 19","true","35.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","16"

There are countless activities to do. Hacking is a lot of fun; you can walk around town, hack stuff and watch people’s reaction. It is awesome.\nStealth is the most satisfying experience in the game. You can avoid the cops my stealth killing the witness or by threatening them. My only complaint, you can’t melee the civilians. Melee and Jump is contextual, you can only use it when the game requires you to do so.\nParkour is really good; you can jump over small walls, obstacles and vehicles. Parkour + Stealth makes up for a perfect vigilante.\nI was worried about the look and physics of vehicles. Cars look much better than what we saw in streams (may be they look different on PC?). Driving is a bit different and it would take some time getting used to. It is kind of like racing games; which is not good for tight corners in the city. I personally prefer driving mechanics of GTA V. Car damage is not like GTA V, it is more like racing games like Need for Speed.\n\n\nThe City:\n\n\nThe city feels dense and so much alive. There are people doing various activities. You will come across variety of civilians like street performers, hookers, criminals, hackers, business men, drug addicts, bankers, blue collar workers. They are not just dumb pedestrians, you can listen to them talking about their life and what’s going on in the city. Sometimes while walking around, I want to stop and listen to them or watch a street performer. They also react and respond to your actions.\nYou can go inside many buildings like ctOS stations, bars, cafes, pharmacy, shops etc.\nThere is quite a bit of traffic on the streets. You can hear bass thumping from some cars. I hacked a traffic signal on a busy intersection and it caused a massive pile up of cars. There were cars crashing & blowing up; people were helping each other. It even caused a big traffic jam.\n\n\nGraphics:\n\n\nThe game looks gorgeous, much better than what we have seen in videos and live streams so far. Graphics and textures are much better than any other open world game including AC IV: Black Flag. Those screenshots we saw in the morning today, they do no justice. Unlike the PS4 version, there are no pop-in issues. The game does have next-gen feel.\nWeather and Lighting:\nWind and Rain are mind blowing. These are the best weather effects I've experienced in a game so far. The lighting is awesome for the most part. Morning, evening and night looks gorgeous with beautiful lighting and reflects. It is the only game where I love the nights; I hated nighttime in GTA V. The light is over exposed sometimes during noon, it washes off the textures a bit but it still look good.\n\n\n\nScore: 8.9","July 18, 2014","true","70.0"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

Maybe too much and in the end this has become the game’s weak point. Ubisoft built up expectations over months and or even over years. The new character was presented as the coolest guy ever, as so special in comparison to all other game characters. Big carton figures and huge posters were found everywhere, in every game shop, on every expo. Even daily newspapers had stories about the game and its revolutionary and technology critical hacking feature.\n\nAnd then there was the graphics. The early version they have shown was completely faked. Ubisoft made people believe that this game would almost look realistic. Actually that their console or their average PC, two years ago, could handle it. In the end the graphics could not hold up to the expectations. But I call this a classic Ubisoft step what we have also seen recently with The Division and they have to stop this ASAP. It is damaging their reputation and the confidence of players in their games.\n\nAnd now... just imagine this game would have been shown with its real graphics? Would have been shown as a decent GTA clone with a new IP?! All of this without overhyping it. People would have received the game well. They would have talked good about it, and would even today. No doubt about this.\n\nI try forgetting the ridiculous hype. I did not fell for it anyways and will never do. I know that the videos they show on an expo are mostly fake, pre-rendered...\n\nWatch_Dogs is therefore for me a good action-adventure with some smart and interesting new ideas. It looks a bit like GTA, but it feels different. It is dark and without humour and yes the story is not that captivating as I would have hoped. However I like going through the missions, I like driving around in Chicago and enjoy the nice graphics and the dark and heavy atmosphere in every corner.\n\nTherefore I would like to recommend the game to all those that like GTA and a good story-driven action adventure with a huge and beautiful open world.\n\nWhat I liked\nDark and heavy atmosphere\nDetailed graphics and a huge city with very interesting spots\nIntensive fights with a lot of strategic possibilities\nPlenty of missions and side missions\nIt makes me come back to play just one more mission\nDecent story\nOnline competition feature; but almost off nowadays\nWhat I didn't like\nStory has no humour, takes itself very serious\nControls are not made for PC with mouse acceleration by default. Use the following fix:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/26c0v3/mouse_accelaration_fix/\nNo native 3D vision. Use the following fix:\nhttp://helixmod.blogspot.lu/2014/09/watch-dogs-dx11-3dmigoto-3d-vision-fix.html\nEven if there are plenty of side missions I am not very interested in playing them\nThere seem to be some problems with the audio I could not fix yet\nMain character is ok, but not really sympathetic\nNo ego-perspective; GTA V showed how this can be done to make everyone happy\nUse of hacking limits itself on pushing the Q button from time to time, not really revolutionary\nOverall I recommend the game. I like playing it. I have fun playing it and it has some really cool moments. The fights are tactical and great and they feel like in The Division, but without the RPG element of thousands hits. One shot, one kill. Give it a chance if you have it in your library.","April 5","true","12.6"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","5"

The ability to hack gives the ability to be stealthy, crafty and also very lethal. This game is no doubt fun, but I strongly recommend you do not get it for the PC. It has been poorly implemented and has caused a lot of issues with many people in order to just run the game or get past the broken and awfully made Uplay software. When it comes to software and websites, Ubisoft just don't try, both their website and Uplay software are just plain broken. As to do with gameplay, well on PC it just won't run well unless you have either: a decent computer or the ability to change startup options in a way that doesnt affect gameplay. Can I also just say that driving is quite slippery and the the third person shooting is a bit topsy-turvy when it comes to recoil and just plain aiming.\n\nDespite all those things, it's worth playing and totally worth the amount I paid, but I highly recommend you get it on a console than the PC, you'll have a lot less trouble just playing it rather than just having to get it started.\n\nFor high tech gaming with no major issues or problems, console gamers win this round against PC gamers.","May 29, 2014","true","28.9"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","1"

Let us forget about all the people bashing this game for the most idiotic reasons. Let us... review Watch_Dogs:\n\nLet me start by saying that this game isn't perfect. It doesn't have to be. As long as it's fun. And although the game manages to frustrate sometimes, it's nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be.\n\nGetting the game to run properly was a task of its own when the game just released. With Uplay being the main problem here. Ubisoft managed to fix things fairly quickly and after a small delay we were finally playing the long awaited Watch_Dogs.\nThen came the second problem: optimization problems. Vysnc totally breaks this game. It took me a moment to figure out and once it's disabled (and forced via your videocard's control panel) everything runs fairly smooth, with an ocassional hiccup here and there. I never managed to get below 58fps, which is a good sign.\n\nVisually the game looks impressive. As long as you don't compare it with its E3 reveal you won't notice a thing. It's a detailed city with some amazing locations and unfortunately a bit of pop-up (objects suddenly appearing out of thin air). Character models looks great, cars shine and reflect nicely, the water looks amazing and the city just feels alive, filled with tons of people. Really impressive stuff.\nThe music, on the other hand, I didn't like but that's a matter of taste. The sounds and voice acting were excellent, however.\n\nGameplay wise the game is less impressive but still great fun. Hacking is done by the press of a button and it's because it's so easy that it's fun. I don't want to hack in a realistic way, that takes away all the fun. Besides, there are some mini games that already give you the illusion that you're hacking something (ok, it still does a poor job there, but it's more complex than pressing a button at least).\nIt all begins slowly but after a few hours you have the ability to upgrade all of your skills/perks. And that's where the game opens up. Investing your points in your Hacking skill tree isn't necessary but it makes the game that more fun. Disabling helicopters and destroying cars in pursuit is wonderful and makes you feel powerful. When you're driving there's a handy button to look back. It's ideal for hacking stuff when you're being chased. Hacking something at the right time will slow down the action and show the moment in excellent Burnout-like detail.\nThe missions also allow the player to use stealth. This doesn't always work like it should, but detonating bombs that your enemies are carrying or exploding a fusebox when an enemy is nearby feels very satisfying. Especially if you finish the mission without being detected. And even if you're detected you can kill your enemies by using the many, many weapons available. Time can also be slowed down so that you can aim better and kill off your enemies faster. There are plenty of ways to complete a mission.\n\nThere are also plenty of story missions to complete (which is a little bit cliche, but interesting nevertheless) and finishing nothing but the story should take about 15 hours. But of course, that's not why you're playing Watch_Dogs. You want side activities, mini-games, collectibles, et cetera. Let me tell you that Watch_Dogs has more than enough content in that area. When I finished the game I had completed about 40% of the entire game. 100% will take you at least 50-75 hours. There are augmented reality games, side missions, people to hack for money/music or cars. There are mysteries to solve, towers to unlock, you name it. It's chock full of content.\n\nAnd then there's the multiplayer, which is partly integrated in your single-player experience. At any time you can be hacked by a random person. When you're being hacked you have a few minutes to find the person that's trying to hack you (there's a perimeter in which you have to search). Sounds simple, I know, but it can be really hard. Players can stand between tons of non-player characters and hide behind plenty of objects. It's pretty tense and so much fun. And obviously, you can do the same thing. It's a great experience and a really unique one.\n\nWatch_Dogs is one of my favorite games of the year. No, it's not the best game by any means. There's plenty of room for perfection, but I'm sure the next one will give us even more stuff to do, next to adding and improving features.\nSure, it's a hefty price to pay, but there's so much gameplay in it. Believe me when I say that it really *is* worth the asking price.\nBut please, in any case, try it for yourself. Clear your mind and don't let other people try to influence you (too much).\n\n[Rating: 89/100]","June 4, 2014","true","25.3"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","1"

I can't defend Watchdogs from its' critisizims when it has a publisher known as "Ubisoft".\n\nNow that I have got that out of the way I am pleased to say; Watchdogs is a great game. So long as you don't presume the graphics will be crysis 4 and the gameplay "Imersive, realistic depiction of a future poisened with decieving technology". There is alot of fun to be had with this title, the world is jam packed with things to do, 70% are incredibly fun like Gang hideouts and Criminal convoys along with robust shooting and an amazing cover system the gameplay value I believe to be $30 AUS (so get the game on sale).\n\nLet's talk about the selling point; Hacking. Even those who completely despise the game will agree that no game can compare to watchdogs when it comes to an intuative and fun to use hacking system. The hacking system adds another layer to an already strong gameplay experience.\n\nYes, the story is ♥♥♥♥. This is because of the awful characters who, (while voice acted very well) all suffer from being cartoon characters that are hard to take seriously. I honestly don't really mind the supporting cast and I thought they did their job but it's the main character Ayden Pierce who makes me want to recommend the Ubisoft writing team a long holiday and Physiatric help when it comes to writing a lead character. Ayden is honestly the most annoying aspect of the game, he acts like he is actually helping people though he is ignorant to all the killing he is doing (or technically, the player is doing). In short he is kind of like one of those A holes who does anything to impress someone they have the hots for, (If you don't know the kind of people im talking about just go to the aftermath of a local band).\n\nSo would I recommend Watch_Dogs?\n\nYes, I delivers a fun sandbox experience with unique hacking mechanics (not gimmics) as well as a large supply of content making it a great pick for a steam sale.","December 28, 2015","true","58.4"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","15","23","2","0"

For those of you who think it's GTA vs Watch Dogs -- let me stop you right there. These games are fundamentally different, and so I would say "Why not both??" Yes, they're both based in an open world, and both basically allow you to do practically whatever you want. But in GTA, for the most part, there aren't many consequences for your actions. Run down a ton of people on the street, get some stars, and then lead the cops on a hilarious and explosive chase. If you die - no worries, you'll respawn at home (hospital - whichever version of GTA you're talking about), with various amounts of dollars missing from your wallet. Go back outside -- do the same stuff over again. And honestly - that's what makes GTA the great game it is. Knowing that you can do what you wish, and the game won't hold it against you. With Watch Dogs, this concept no longer applies. Now your choices start to matter. Now the consequences matter. As McFly would say, "This is Heavy, Doc...."\n\nFor those of you who have been under a rock the past couple of years - Watch Dogs has been a highly expected game from Ubisoft, who went so far as to delay the release of this game by around 6 months, just to try and perfect it. In Watch Dogs, you're in the city of Chicago, who's infrastructure and crime prevention system is run by a supercomputer named ctOS. In all actuality, this reality isn't that farfetched. Driverless transit systems are common (London, Seoul, Tokyo, DC, San Francisco, among others) and we all know the ever-prevalent security camera systems in many cities. The only difference here is in the game, everyone's information is also tied into the system. Characteristics, bank accounts, credit cards, school and criminal records - you name it, it exists in the system. So the question arises, "What if someone hacks the system?" And it's with this premise that Watch Dogs has you play in...\n\nI won't lie - I downloaded the game a tad early, thanks to some various websites (I'm sorry, after getting burned on the last 3 preorders I've done for PC - Command and Conquer 4, Mass Effect 3, and SimCity 5, I don't intend on any game getting the best of me again), and I can really say that the game lives mostly up to its hype, although it still needs some work on the PC.\n\nThe environment of Chicago looks fantastic, and from the dry run I played, the main storyline is actually quite good. My main beef with the PC version is the driving handling is awful, and it's especially a pain when there's a chase going on, and you're trying to avoid hitting pedestrians, (trust me, watch what happens the first time you hit a street walker - go on, I dare you!) and your car just refuses to make that turn you need it to make.\n\nI gotta give props to the Ubisoft guys - the NPCs in this game are some of the best I've seen yet. I remember walking towards an intersection, and just then an accident occurred, and everyone starts pulling out their phones and recording/taking pictures. Also, depending on what kind of reputation you get later in the game, people will start to recognize you, and either call the cops or try and take a picture of you, based on whether you choose to be good or bad. Pay attention to the banter and dialogue of the NPCs, and it becomes clear Ubisoft really worked hard on this aspect of the game.\n\nThe game specs recommend quite a beefy computer - but I was able to play it quite smoothly on my Lenovo W530 laptop (2.3 GHz Core i7, nVidia K1000, 256 GB SSD, 16 GB RAM), although I did have to turn off some of the reflections and ambient occlusion and all that. Only choppiness I got was from some cutscene videos that stuttered, though the audio came through no problem.\n\nOnline play is somewhat optional - the game early on forces a mission on you to at least attempt the online scene, so at least you can get a feel for the play, but fortunately, that's it - storyline wise at least. Online Decryption is actually a lot more interesting than I thought it would be - having a team vs team, with everyone throwing their hacks around, is tons of fun.\n\nAll in all, Ubisoft did an awesome job on the game, which in retrospect they better have, since they took an extra 6 months to finish up. The game gets a solid 4.5 stars, but the originality of the concept bumps it up in my book to 5.","May 27, 2014","true","58.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","2"

Regulary watches torture porn wtf? -- yes, a person literally had that over their head.)\nCon's:\n- Character's may act a little funny at times\n- You may experience a few game crashes ( I had 2 crashes and one blue screen for a overheating issue )\n- Lip-moving sync isn't really there if it's not a rendered scene "movie cut"\n- Main character somewhat lacks emotion\n\nLonger response:\n\nIt's a great game in my opinion, I think you'll enjoy the playthrough and have a few emotional moments in the game, a controversal "problem" people have is that the main character "Aidan" seems to lack emotion and facial expression even when situations are dire, now to support that claim, yes. He does lack some emotion even in emotional situations. However to defend that, his character has developed after a certain incident happened with someone, he's developed to not feel, so that may be why. While he does bring very little emotion back, there are a few scenes where it's showed a bit more. Personally I'm excited for Watch Dogs 2 and I hope they bring back Aidan and a few other characters, one thing I will say is that the game does offer some great comedy from some characters and you'll enjoy it.

It's good enough that I don't find myself not wanting to continue the campaign, and occasionally has parts of it that I really, really like. Some parts are tedious though, but like I said, not enough for me to put the game down.\n\nThe gameplay itself is pretty much.. there. You're given most of what you can do at the start and you can build up to the bigger things using the skill tree. I'd say I use the hacks in the game pretty regularly, just as the game intended. If you don't you're probably running around like an idiot gunning things down, and that's not how the game is supposed to go. It's stealth, and that's right up my alley.\n\nThe multiplayer is definitely a fun aspect of the game. It gives more meaning than 'dudes fighting' like in Call of Duty, because you're either hacking another person, trying to get a file with or without a team, or.. well, I haven't tried the other modes. It's pretty easy to play for me and I haven't encountered a single (literal)  hacker, so... Although, my experiences with the multiplayer hacking thing were fun. This one guy tried to hack me but was driving in plain sight, when I saw him he drove off, so I chased him. He drove off a cliff into the water, so to shoot him I jumped out because there was still land for me to fall on. Fell a bit too hard though. Still won cuz I found him.\n\nThe sounds. The ♥♥♥♥ing sounds, man. The vehicles are decent, the sounds the player makes (walking, running, climbing, etc.) are decent, animation sequence sounds are decent, UI sounds fit and are decent... but the ♥♥♥♥ing gun sounds. They didn't even take the time to randomize pitch, it's like one ♥♥♥♥ing gunshot sound that replays over and over. Seriously? You didn't record ANY more sounds for each gun? Just shot once and said 'ok, next gun'? Jesus.\n\nThe game's good enough for me to say it deserved the $29.99. Although every time I play it my friends are like "LEL WATCHDAGS," I'm usually stuck to it for a couple hours each time I play. All it needs is better optimization (not that much of a problem, lags only when driving really fast), and a bit more of what e3 has shown we could do.\n\nOh yeah, this game does a really good job of allowing players to act normal. You can walk at an actual walking pace and it's not just slowed down like in most FPS games, so it doesn't feel unreal or something. You can turn your car off before you get out if you really wanted to get down to the bones, which I sometimes do if I don't feel like I'm in a hurry.","November 29, 2014","true","30.4"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","21","35","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wesleysmalls/recommended/243470/","wesleysmalls","WesleySmalls","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wesleysmalls/","427 products in account","Most disappointing game of 2014.\n\nIt was announced with quite a bit of hype, and not only that, it was looking pretty great. What you get is not even a slight bit of that.\n\nI see a lot of people claiming about the lack of optimization. Well, that is the least of it's issues.\n\nWhat you get is a game that lacks basic features that gets pretty dull pretty quick. Pressing Q becomes rather dull, and I am quite sure you do quite a lot more than press a button as a hacker. You have a smartphone that hacks into the ctOS network giving you full power of everything, and all you really use it for is steal from innocent people, eavesdrop on innocent people and put traffict lights on green. It is pretty cool to do all of that, for about 5 minutes, then it becomes such a drag.\n\nHacking is something exciting and so is privacy, yet Watch_Dogs doesn't portray that all that well. There is fairly limited ability to use for such a big system, and even your smartphone itself has very little use, even though that plays a giant role in it's setting. Everybody can make calls in the world, everybody can make pictures. Why can't I? It would fit incredibly great in Multiplayer.\n\nThe game is lacking some fairly basic functions too. Where is melee for example? I have this beautiful stick that I can use in exactly two settings. To catch a criminal, and to sneak up on an enemy. I can't use it on civilians yet I can shoot them all dead if I wanted to. Oh, and shooting them dead, don't expect something fancy there, it's all one shot, one kill. And then the police, I don't really get it's system in general, nor the availability of the police. I have yet to see police actually patrol, which makes sense, but when the ctOS targets me, police are in the region pretty damn quick. Not to mention they can't chase you on water in a world that has quite a bit of water.\n\nhalf of the gameplay mechanics have been ripped off from other Ubi games. Animations are straight from Assassins Creed IV, and the funky radio towers are straight from Far Cry 3. And when I say half, I truly mean it, there isn't very much more to it.\n\nThe game physics are absolutely abysmal, and I'm being nice by saying that. Absolutely horrible. It makes me doubt if they even had a physics crew. You make huge jumps with no speed and destroy everything in your path with ease. Some objects are destructable, and that is just as bad. Search a few glitches on youtube of it, and you'll find enough.\n\nThe only good thing I can name is the sound. I truly enjoy the phone calls that you can listen on, they sound incredible. The same goes for emergency calls. They sound incredibly believeble. The human interaction has been voiced incredibly well in this game. Also the sound of collisions are pretty good, there is some actual weight in that. And instead of a broken glass sound, you get an actual sound of metal colliding and deforming. It sounds really, really great.\n\nI guess i at least have the luck of not having to witness the horror stories that were spread before the release, as the release version was more positive than those horror stories led to believe. But as that died down so did the enjoyment in this game. It's not worth 60 euros, not worth 50, 40, 30 or 20. It's an absolute piece of garbage that is carried by it's hype, and I am really regretting my purchase big time.","May 30, 2014","false","6.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DawnPaladin/recommended/243470/","DawnPaladin","DawnPaladin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DawnPaladin/","152 products in account","I really wanted to like Watch_Dogs more. I'd been eagerly looking forward to it since the E3 preview back in 2012. Since I was so disappointed by the ending to Assassin's Creed 3, I was hoping Ubisoft would redeem themselves with this game.\n\nAnd Watch_Dogs has a lot of good stuff in it. The miniature Chicago Ubisoft has built is magnificent, and exploring it by foot, by subway, and by camera traversal is great fun. The game has some fine tactical challenges; I remember one mission where I had to infiltrate a very heavily armed camp and assassinate two officers. I must have retried that mission at least twenty times before I got it right, but it never felt unfair; I had very powerful tools to work with, and it was just a matter of finessing their use exactly right to overcome the challenge.\n\nAnd the tools they give you are a lot of fun. You can bounce your perspective from camera to camera, and said cameras are generously placed (except when they would allow you to bypass a puzzle or combat challenge); this is a fantastic way of letting the player survey a situation before they go in and decide on an optimal approach. This is so much fun that there are a couple of missions built around this idea, and I'd say they're the best in the game. Remember that scene from "The Matrix" where Morphus calls Neo and guides him through the building step-by-step, allowing him to evade capture by the Agents? You get to do that for some of the NPCs, and it's every bit as fun as it sounds. There's an infiltration mission where you guide an NPC up through a skyscraper, floor by floor, helping him walk right past cameras and alert sentries by setting distractions and disabling security measures. It's tense, original gameplay, and it's very well done.\n\nWatch_Dogs is at its best when it's being cerebral. As the game progresses, you learn to create various traps and to use the environment to ensure your success; sometimes the game will give you a few minutes in the middle of a mission to turn the area into a deathtrap before the bad guys show up. There's some good stealth gameplay; much like in Assassin's Creed, missions go smoothest if it's all stealth takedowns and no open combat.\n\nAnd that's where things start to fall apart, because Watch_Dogs REALLY wants you to do open combat. The game has a number of missions that are straight-up gunfights. The problem is that Aidan Pearce, the game's protagonist, is ill-suited to be an action hero. He keeps dozens of weapons stashed in his trenchcoat, but he's quite fragile, so he relies on cover a lot. Unfortunately, the cover system is a better fit for stealth than combat. I found the gunfights unsatisfying.\n\nI wish the game had relied on hacking more and on guns less. Remember Mirror's Edge, which had free-running as its main feature? You could pick up guns if you wanted to, but they slowed you down, so you wanted to use them sparingly. I wish Watch_Dogs had borrowed that idea--there's no reason Aidan Pearce has to be able to carry a sniper rifle, a grenade launcher, three pistols, and four shotguns in his trenchcoat. The smartphone is what he's all about--shift more gameplay over there!\n\nThe characters are the worst part of this game. Aidan is such a blurry protagonist. All of his actions throughout the game spring from his motivation to avenge his dead niece. He messed with some bad people, and her death was part of their retaliation. The unjust murder of this innocent girl is what motivates him to go on a rampage throughout the city, killing scores of people, some of whom are quite evil and some of whom are just in the way. There's no real ideology that motivates Aidan the way there is with the Assassins and the Templars. Most of the time he seems to see nothing wrong with killing innocent people along the way to avenging his innocent niece, and that makes him hard to sympathize with.\n\nI was especially disappointed with Clara, his female sidekick. She starts out as a badass, tattooed-up hacker who manipulates servers and people with the best of them, but the first time a fight breaks out she instantly turns into a damsel in distress. Aidan promptly gets an objective notification to "PROTECT CLARA" as she wails about all the unpleasant gunfire and begs Aidan to make the bad men go away. I was really hoping Ubisoft could write more interesting female characters than that.\n\nThe story's primary antagonist is a mustache-twirling villain. He throws eloquent barbs at Aidan, rants about how the world misunderstands and underappreciates him, and cackles his grand plan into a cell phone. His personality can be summed up as "What if Snidely Whiplash...WAS A HACKER?!?"\n\nThe only interesting character is Jordi Chin. He's the only member of the cast who truly loves his job, which is to be a trigger man and make problems go away. His cheerful amorality brings some great humor, which the game badly needs.\n\nBefore I wrap up this review, I have to talk about human trafficking. The trailers for Watch_Dogs promised that a human trafficking ring would be part of the plot, and it is, but it only shows up in a handful of missions in the main storyline. There's a series of mini-missions you can do on the side to investigate further, but there's scarcely any content there, and the final mission that they unlock is a rote copy-and-paste of another standard mission type. Human trafficking disgusts me; it's a real, very serious problem both in the United States and abroad, and I was excited to see it brought up in a AAA game in a way that might raise awareness about the issue. I was disappointed at the relatively cursory treatment it received, especially when the game has so many random open-world minigames that it doesn't need. Chess puzzles in cafes, Ubisoft? Really?\n\nI've really fallen out of love with Ubisoft as of this game. We had some great things together--I'll never forget Assassin's Creed 2--but it's pretty clear they're not the company I thought they were. They make some pretty good gameplay, but the writing has been trending downward year after year, and if the story tastes sour, I don't care about the rest. It's been years since I was as excited about a game as I was about Watch_Dogs; I even bought the Deluxe edition. What a waste. And I'm not even going to talk about the massive disrespect Ubisoft showed PC gamers by crippling the graphics on the PC version, or the game-crashing bugs on launch, or the way the exciting and innovative multiplayer fell flat on its face because they couldn't get the network coding right.\n\nThe game has its good parts. If you can get it for less than $40 on a Steam Sale, I'd consider that a good buy. (Be sure to install TheWorse Mod for a huge improvement in graphics quality.) But it could have been wonderful, and that didn't happen. Ubisoft and I are done for now.","July 27, 2014","false","38.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The game isn't perfect, the main character and story are extremely generic and as with most open world games the opimization could always be a bit better.\n\nOther than that though I am liking most of all the other aspects that Watch Dogs brings to the table. Exploring the city doing random things is a blast, I have over 20 hours on the game already and only done 3 main campaign missions. I loved to go around and do my own thing in games like Read Dead Redemption, Fallout New Vegas, Farcry3 and GTA5, and Watch dogs offers some great stuff to do aswell when it comes to random events and side quests. The racing/driving I was not huge on at first but after 4-5 hours I started to enjoy it more. It handles loose and with less weight than say Forza or Grand Turismo, and more like DIRT or Rally Sport challenge. Still the driving aspect could be a bit better.\n\nNot a perfect game but it brings a ton of good things to the table and I can see myself playing this for atleast another 40-60 hours. With some improvement to the main character and some more work on optimization next games in this series could be even better. The hacking is fun, spying  on people and doing random crime events is a ton of fun, as is the versus modes and the Free Roam in which you and friends can cause havoc together. Right now I would give this game a 8.5 or 9/10, but still many more hours to be had, so far the good outweigh the bad by a large amount I must say.\n\nIn a year dominated by indie games and kickstarter games for myself (Banished, Child Of Light, Transistor, Tesla Effect, Wasteland2, Divinity Original Sin,etc..), it is nice to finally get a good AAA game, especially after being very dissapointed with Elderscrolls Online. Some of the little things in this game are just great, such as people putting on coats or using umbrellas when its raining, the trees, grass and green leaves all moving with the wind, the intense feeling of being invading in game and the joy of feeling like a superhero as you save some lady from getting killed during a random crime you just so happened to hear about with tech goodies.\n\nIs it better than GTA5? In some ways yes, in some ways no (Let's not forget it is it's own game). I think GTA5 is a bit more polished and I like the story/characters more but I also love the hacking, the invading aspect and the game world of Watch Dogs a ton. Both are very good open world games though! If you want an open world game that has some cool new gadgets, a wonderfully crafted gameworld, nice graphics, a wonderfully executed Invading aspect and fun gameplay and don't mind it being light on story or the main character being generic, pick this up ASAP! I think GTA5 is a little better overall but don't let that put you off Watch Dogs because the gunplay, hacking, invasions and stealth are all very well done.\n\nJust finished it, hit the 80 hour mark, did alot of side quests and the tailing invasions, overall good game if you wanted a score I could understand anywhere from a 7/10 to a 9/10. Maybe toss me in the middle with a 8/10.","May 28, 2014","true","91.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","3"

Eventually we got into the game only to find the graphical settings all messed up and horrible framerates. Many members of the community banded together to fix these problems but the random crashes is what killed this game for most people. I soldiered on for another month I only got the ocassional crash, I completed the game and was almost done with the side missions when an update wiped out peoples saves. That was the last straw. Luckily Assassin's Creed Unity came out so I had another headache to deal with.\n\nAfter a year of waiting for all the patches and DLC to roll out and bugs to be fixed I can honestly say I really enjoyed this game. The storyline was great, I personally loved the vigilante portion and if you feel so inclined you can go on the classic GTA style kill all the cops and have a car chase. I would highly recommend this game to anyone. The audio logs and other collectables are worth listening to, Multiplayer which is still highly active is like a GTA Multiplayer experience and it is incredibly fun.

It's a potentially deep subject to cover and, despite how prevalent it is in the world, many games don't attempt to talk at length about how our reliance on modern machinery and tech in general affects us.\n\nSadly, for all it's lofty goals, Watch Dogs is more an open world game that beats it's message into you rather than a contained story involving true thought provoking techniques and ideas.\n\nIt is a graphically impressive game, full of reflective surfaces and mostly smooth frame-rates, but the world still manages to feel dead despite it's population. The easiest example of this is anytime you drive a car near a curb with people nearby. The first time someone mocks you for driving so "badly," you may get a feeling of immersion. The fiftieth, often from multiple people saying it at exactly the same time? Not so much.\n\nIt may seem like a small thing but the repetition the game brings will wear on you, and do so quickly. Pedestrians are often obvious color palette swaps of one another, the facial models and even clothing worn multiple times in the same crowd. Whatever their reasons for this, the developers of Watch Dogs managed to create a world full of people...that don't make you think of people at all. Instead, they are marionettes. Their strings tugged to make them move in what could almost be considered a lifelike performance.\n\nThe game play itself, outside of this full yet somehow artificial world, is once again at odds with itself. The game tries very hard to sell you on your character's skills and feelings about how those with power use it but, at the end of the day, he is an amoral man who does things just as bad (often worse actually) than the people he is claiming to fight against. An example is how you are often asked to stop crimes in progress, only to turn around and hack the person you just saved so that you can drain money from their bank account to add to your own. The game makes no mention of this being so obviously wrong and hypocritical, but it's there all the same. Story beats follow much the same path, asking you to do things it frowned upon only seconds earlier.\n\nOn that topic, the story itself is a mess. Considering what I've just mentioned and in how it's told to begin with, the line between what you do and what you're adversaries do is so thin already but the plot's pacing does it no favors. Characters will be killed off or introduced in ways that make little sense, breaking what little flow the game is trying to maintain.\n\nAll this being said: There is a good game in here somewhere. The controls work well, the shooting is tight and, like I mentioned, the graphics are well done. In addition to all that, when the hacking angle is played well, it's a really fun time. A perfect example of this is the "Song Sneak" app that the game makes a part of your cell phone. If you're near what sounds like a new song, whether it's playing on a newsstand or from a nearby car in the game world, you can start the app and it will add the song to your available playlist. It's a small feature but it shows potential for innovation further along in the series.\n\nI mentioned at the beginning of this review that it was a hard one to write and that is really for one main reason: For everything that it could have been, Watch Dogs is an open world game that falls too easily into one of many generic descriptors. I hope that a sequel is in the works, if only to see this idea given a proper showing but, as it stands now, I can't recommend the game to anyone unless they've got a great deal on it, an empty weekend or, sadly, both.","November 16, 2014","false","37.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

I just can't get lost in this world like I could in previous GTA, Infamous, TES, or even AC games. It feels like a chore to go from one place to another.

McSalty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sgtmcsalty/","250 products in account","I have a very "love-hate" relationship with this game, so "mixed" fits the user reviews pretty well in my opinion. Watch_Dogs suffers from Ubi-itus pretty bad, but I actually like Ubisoft's open world stlye. In fact, where many say this game is a little too Assassin's Creed, I think it could use more. You get ONE melee weapon for non-lethal takedowns. That's it. You don't get any non-lethal toys (besides distractions that require you take aditional action). You can shoot people in the knees, but you often shoot THROUGH thier (horribly developed) hitboxes and shoot a civilian instead.\n\nShould you choose "HAM", you'll find that the police in this game are as annoying as any other police in any other car chase game made in the last two decades. For SOME reason, "good cop AI" went out the door with GTA3 and NEVER CAME BACK! The cops in THIS game are SUPER annoying. They can "scan" for you no matter where you are and, if you're not in a vehicle running 100+ on a highway, you're going to get "marked". Imagine playing WoW as a rogue and having the GAME say "all stealth units now have hunter's mark", because THAT is exactly what you get. YOU can be 10+ blocks from the nearest cop/gangster and the AI will start shooting at you, though you're well hidden. You can hide from a helicopter under an overpass in a car and the helicopter will hover above you saying "we lost them, we lost them, we lost them" ... not completeing the escape of course, you have to LEAVE the vehice which IMMEDIATLY makes the helicopter say "we found him".\n\nGOD I HATE HOW CTOS SCANS WORK!\n(you shouldn't have to spend FIVE blocker gadgets to get away from them and the AI should NOT follow you around with them if they "supposedly" can't find you. The AI knowing where you are 100% of the time is ANNOYING AS HELL!)\n\n\nIt's SOOOO BAD! The AI in this game is a total JOKE!\n\nNow for the driving. EVERY car feels the same with a little more or a little less power. What you REALLY feel like is your "power" is an invisible 8 year old pushing your car around the city like a hot-wheels on a plastic track. IT IS HORRIBLE! The focus idea is DUMB DUMB DUMB unless you plan to turn off multiplayer, because EVERY SINGLE TIME you get going well in a car using your focus, a PvP player enters your game and your focus stops working. HOW DUMB IS THAT!? Not only does it tell the person being tailed that they're now engaging in PvP when it's SUPPOSED to be a secret, but it can totally cause you to wreck, because there is no warning that you're losing your focus until you try to use it and it's gone.\n\nThe story is BLAND and cliche as heck. And, is anyone else tired of Ubisoft Montreal INSISTING on the French accent with voice actors? Michael Mando from Farcry 3 pulled off "Vaas" using this accent, but Isabelle Blais has an ANNOYING level of broken English as "Clara". I WANT her to die (spoiler).\n\nThe graphics are good, but they're no where near what they advertised before the game released. You can use mods to get "closer" but at a HUGE FPS drop. Ubisoft has a BAD habbit of making a game for super-computers that no one even has access to, making a bunch of hype and propaganda, then downgrading to fit the "console" pesants. What they NEED to do is go back to making games for PC and porting them to console. That's the way it SHOULD be, but SONY has their hand so far down Ubisoft's pants that will NEVER happen.\n\nDon't buy this title unless it's on sale for $20 or less. It was worth more than that when it came out, but not much. New price for this game should have been 29.99. It's a "shell" of what the game could be. You have to suspend disbelief WAY too much in this game... so much so that it eventually feels like you're playing Saints Row .. and that is NOT a good thing. Saints Row is the ONLY game in this genre allowed to go down the "crazy" path. Any other game tries it and it's just BAD. THIS game's "mini-game" and "side-game" addiction leans WAY too close to Saints Row for my taste. The only thing this game lacks in that area is a big purple D|LDO and a clown car and it would be right on path for winning a "Saints Row Fail Award".\n\nTL;DR\nThis is a "baby" GTA game with "easymode" hacking (no skill required). Let me repeat, this game is just trying to be GTA, but smaller, and with some VERY lame hacking. The hacking is "fun", but it's not "hacking" .. it's just... dumb. It's hard to explain, but again, your suspension of disbelief must be STRONG for this game.","March 20, 2015","false","76.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","2"

It's because they are AMD users and this game is optimized for Nvidia graphics card only. If you have an AMD graphic card DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.\n\nNow I'm going to talk about the game instead of complaining about it.\n\nWatch_Dogs is a very strategic game, the aim of the missions are not straight forward.\nLet's say you are in pursuit of a criminal in a car. You can hack traffic lights to cause accidents or blow up pipes underground to takedown or slow down the enemy.\nThis game features a good storyline and superb graphics (of course you will need a good rig for that)\nYou can literally hack anything electronic in the city, including steam pipes, phones and more.\n\nTheres not only the campaign in this game. There are sub-missions. For example, when you hack someone, it collects data from them. So if the guy is being suspicious, you can take them down to save a life. Of course theres more.\n\nThe multiplayer in this game is something I've never seen before, if you're playing singleplayer in your own world, anyone can go into your world and look like an NPC and he can try and tail you, collect information and report it to the cops.\nThe best feature in the multiplayer is that you can play Watch Dogs with a friend that doesn't have Watch Dogs, He can download an app in his phone, try and stop you by hacking obstacles while you have to drive to checkpoints.\n\nI feel sorry for AMD users, as this game is really well made and I would really recommend it.

The game was definitely overhyped with all these adds, trailers, gameplay, etc., but overall, the game is good.\nThere is an incredible amount of whiners/haters around the Watch_Dogs community that say that the graphics are crap, that the game freezes, crashes, etc. (which will most likely thumb down my review just because it says "Recommended").\nWhile this might be true for them, I have not experienced a single crash.  The graphics are definitely good enough for me, and even if they weren't, a game is made for fun, not for the graphics; graphics are an option.\nThis game is fun, interesting, and different.\n\nSingle Player and Free Roam:\n\nI have played only the SP so far.  It is so much fun! I love having the option of hacking a computer by shooting up the place or by hacking cameras and objects without even entering the restricted area. There are not many activities to do, but running around the streets and looking at what civilians do, crimes happening, accidents, and other, will bring you a lot of gameplay hours (no! it wasn't me shooting everybody in the train!!).\n\nDriving:\n\nThe driving is nothing super, but it's acceptable.  The only thing I don't like about the game except the lag (that I will explain in the next paragraph) is how the camera reacts sometimes when I take a sharp turn.  The camera can be slow when in a vehicle and a few times you are forced to turn the camera with your analog stick or mouse...unless you want to drive without looking in front.\n\nPerformance:\n\nThe performance while on foot is great, the game is smooth and very detailed.  However, this changes when I move at high speeds (car, motorbikes, trains).  My HDD has some issues at loading textures quickly, making lag spikes that sometimes (when entering a new district) may last for an entire second.  If you have a SSD, you should be just fine.  For this reason, I had to lower down the textures at medium to make it run smooth.\nI play with an Nvidia GTX660ti 3 GB video memory, processor i7-3770 @ 3.4 GHz with everything on Ultra except the textures that I have on Medium (I will test them on High).  The game runs smoothly with textures at Medium because the HDD does not have a lot of work to do.\nDespite the lag that forced me to lower down the textures quality, the game is VERY enjoyable.\n\nIf you are looking for perfect graphics and performance with an HDD, you most likely won't like this game; if you just want to have fun and don't care if the graphics are super awesome, it is a good choice.\n\nI would recommend this game to who wouldn't mind spending $60 to try something, but not to who would cry $60; in other words, if you can wait, wait.  If you can't, buy.  My opinion? I love it.\nSteam Summer Sales are coming, you can also get it on other sites at a lower price.\n\nI will add more if it comes up to my mind.","May 28, 2014","true","29.8"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","1"

It's just recycled and slightly altered gameplay (think Assassin's Creed, GTA, Batman) with a hacking theme. For me, the best part was being able to run around Chicago (old hometown).\n\nNothing groundbreaking in terms of a game here, unfortunately:\nHacking traffic lights does nothing for gameplay (cops just blow right through any pileups you have caused),\nHacking NPCs to get money is nothing more than a new way to 'take gold from a container' in any other video game,\nReceving missions via phone was old after GTA: SA.\nEtc.\n\nI will still clock some hours playing it, as it will be my go-to game for wreaking havoc and chaos when the mood strikes due to the Chicago setting... but still, I'd wait for a cheaper GOTY edition in the future before I would re-waste money on such a familiar type of game.\n\nEDIT: I am adding my machine specs here.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Menphues/recommended/243470/","Menphues","ℳєηρнυєs ☯ (Kyle)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Menphues/","1698 products in account","I waited for this game for a very very very very long time so this review is worth noting I would say.\n\nGraphics: They do not seem as good as the photo's above show.  I had the game on day of release so maybe by the time some of you people read this E-mail, there might be a mega patch to update all the graphics and engine to the photos and from what we seen, I remember reading an article saying that Ubisoft would be release a massive patch to correct this but right now as I write this review it has not been changed.  So right now as they stand, they are good but they are not as good as you expect.\nThere are some nice graphical features in the game like sparks, rain drops on car etc\n\nAudio: Everything seems really well done, the talking, motions and sound of engines/ voices/ footprints/ rain etc all are really good.\n\nControls: This is where it becomes a let down.  I am playing the game with an Xbox Pad, because it is over the sholder GTA style view, and I find it easier.  The driving to me feels way to weird and takes some serious getting used too and I do not like the driving much, the character control seems clunky and slow and sometimes does the opposite to what I wanted him to do.\n\nThe story so far seems good, there are tons and tons side missions when you are walking around/ driving around and some crime pops up, or some help needed, or an event or something and you start to attempt it and then someone online jumps in and desides to hack you, really good feature.\nI have only played 2hours of the story so far, and in that time it has not moved much forward and nothing major has happened so I cannot say anything good or bad, but so far it seems decent.\n\nThere is 5 acts I was told and I am half way through act one, and in this time you have seen and done a lot.  Really the game changes pace so many times it is a nice sit back, and relax to everything.  GTA contains running, shooting, driving, running, shooting driving... boring after a while and in Watch_Dogs you run, drive, chase, shoot, hack, talk, meet, drive, greet, hack, spy, follow, stalk etc and it changes so many times you might sometimes lose track of what is going on, but that is good.  You do not want to repeat everything all the time.\n\nThe hacking is the main feature of this game, and it does it well.  There is a decent supply of upgrades, XP and skill points to earn, rank up and spend making you a better player and the game feel like a giant powerful tool.  You may think you are max rank with all the upgrades unlocked and can hack anything and feel powerful but really you are not.... It is not like a cheat as it sounds, you really do have to work from it.\n\nLet me add a little note about the police, they are really hard to evade and have really quick cop cars and very precise at shooting, which is good because in every other open world free roam game you can evade the police with speed and in this game you cannot, which makes it really good fun to try. Even on two bars in a fast car (I am a good driver) I was struggling.\n\nThe world is a decent size and not as small as you expect and the game offers so many things to do you cannot complain of being bored.\n\nThere is a massive performance problem the game I noticed and I have a good PC, example here are my specs:\nCPU: FX8350 Vishera 4Ghz\nRAM: 16GB DDR3 1866Mhz\nGPU: 2x XFX 7950 3GB Crossfire X\n\nI can play any game at max without a hiccup and yet this game seems to be a problem.  If you have AMD machine then you will notice a problem, unless this problem has been fixed in a few weeks or years, just add me if you want and I will let you know with a yes or no.\nIf you have Nvidia then you will be fine because the game is designed for Nvidia pretty much.\n\nMultiplayer is REALLY good fun and a different change of pace for once it is a lot different to all other open world free roam games and you get to use the hack ability online.  Shooting, tooting, booting, running, dying = fun\n\n1v1 hacking is just so much fun.  You get a game, then track the person, start a hack and wait hiding and trying to do everything a bot would do, and then before you know it.  You see the other player going crazy looking for you, and then you must evade and the person is chasing you like crazy, so much fun I find.\n\nThe multiplayer being right now as it speaks is broken.  It is hard to get into a multiplayer game, and even when you do it has taken over 10minutes to load, and before then you are tired of waiting and just want to play the game.  There is news of this problem being fixed but right now it has not so I am sure in the future all is well.\n\nAnyway, would you recommend the game? Yes, right now there is no other game like this out there and it is simply unique and worth the time, money and effort you put into the game, so go ahead buy and enjoy.","May 27, 2014","true","50.9"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","18","31","0","0"

I looked forward to this game and it is a nice concept, but since I mainly play multiplayer games I am very disapointed with my purchase. This game feels rushed (big surprise coming from Ubisoft) as far as mutliplayer is concerned. There is several game modes but half are 1v1, the free roam leaves much to be desired, as the only co-op you can really get is running from the cops (which gets old fast).\n\nAs far as the single player game goes I lost interest after being disapointed with multiplayer. I am writing this as my 1st impression of the game after owning it for a week or so. I may really enjoy the single player game but for now I rather look to other games and smaller companies that at least promise future content rather than this game which more than likely is as good as it is gona get.\n\nI would like to see team based games, ability to raid gang houses or do missions in free roam, those two alone  would add more replayabilty.","June 8, 2014","false","21.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","4"

First of all I got an odd bug that laggs my game like crazy, making it unplayable unless I set the game to offline mode. After contacting support I was told that this would be fixed in a patch, but it's been a LONG time since the game was relesed now, and it's still not patched.\n\nMy game ran ok in online mode sometimes though so I did get to test out multiplayer which, was really fun actually, you can invade other peoples games without them knowing it and spy on them or hack them. Though it seems like a thing you wouldn't go back in and do much after you've finished the game, which isn't neccesarily a bad thing it's just short lived.\n\nSecondly it follows the standard ubisoft open world model, map with boring repetetive side missions like unlocking parts of the map by capturing towers or taking out gang hideouts, which are basically just bandit strongholds in the city that no one seems to care about. Sound familiar? So yeah, it's like third person gta far cry.\n\nHacking is really not a big thing in the game, it's mostly just press X to blow ♥♥♥♥ up. Causing traffic accidents is pretty cool though, the game has really realistic impact damage. But only when it's in a car crash you caused by disabling a red light. Otherwise it's the same old you can drive like a ♥♥♥♥♥ and crash with everyone and they keep driving on happily ever after like usual.\n\nLastly the cops are TERRIBLE, some car chases are insanely hard! It's not even challengeing it's just frustrating. You can unlock a skill to disable helicopters but it's completely useless because they are always straight above you and you cant look straight up. Yeah, it's that stupid.\n\nOh and I'm not even going to mention the graphics downgrade from E3. Except that I just did.\n\nSo it's not a terrible game, but it does not live up to the hype.

I myself seriously tried hours and hours just to log in to finally get play the "best game of the year imo" which totally turned out to be ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI don't understand why Ubisoft has to sugarcoat the games in their own "gameplay" videos but when they release, they decide to make it completely and utterly ♥♥♥♥. Not to mention the missions that were repetitive as ♥♥♥♥. I am not kidding.  There are max 4 different stuff that happens in missions and they are: 1. Mess around with the cameras for while and then kill everyone or escape. 2. Chase someone. 3. Drive someone from point A to point B. 4. Use cameras again trying to help someone in the mission by telling when and where good cover is.\n\nSure its cool when there are robberies you have to stop or Gang hideouts that you attack and other sidemissions but the main missions are... As I said, horrible.\n\nThe driving... I don't even know what to say since the destruction was HORRIBLE and I mean it. For example you are being chased by cops and you decide to raise some blockers. Well okay, it's obvious if you drive fast towards one you die or your car breaks but what I don't understand why they're scripted somehow that when cop car drives into one VERY SLOWLY... it gets destroyed, same with traffic lights.\n\nAnd the ending, I will not spoil but that was one of the biggest disappointments in my life. And I do not understand why Ubisoft couldn't bother making this game perfect since it had the perfect idea and stuff.\n\n\nSo please Ubisoft, either stop making games completely since you people obviously dont know how to make them OR if you seriously keep making games, ATLEAST GET SOME PEOPLE TO TEST IT AND GIVE SOME GOD DAMN FEEDBACK SO YOU WONT RELEASE ♥♥♥♥ LIKE THIS...\n\n\nEDIT: I don't know why but it makes me sad to see all this negative feedback including mine since the game had such a great idea and potential but It just wasn't made right...\n\n\nSo disappointed....","June 3, 2014","false","56.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I looked forward to this game and it is a nice concept, but since I mainly play multiplayer games I am very disapointed with my purchase. This game feels rushed (big surprise coming from Ubisoft) as far as mutliplayer is concerned. There is several game modes but half are 1v1, the free roam leaves much to be desired, as the only co-op you can really get is running from the cops (which gets old fast).\n\nAs far as the single player game goes I lost interest after being disapointed with multiplayer. I am writing this as my 1st impression of the game after owning it for a week or so. I may really enjoy the single player game but for now I rather look to other games and smaller companies that at least promise future content rather than this game which more than likely is as good as it is gona get.\n\nI would like to see team based games, ability to raid gang houses or do missions in free roam, those two alone  would add more replayabilty.","June 8, 2014","false","21.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","4"

This game was downgraded for Console. If I'd known then what I know now I would not have made this purchase. In order for this to run on the 'new gen' consoles they had to gut the graphics. So they didn't show how inferior those consoles are they disabled them on the PC as well. It was discovered and turned back on via community patch. Although patch is a word you use when you add content all the community did is re-enable content that was already in the game but disabled so not to embarrass Sony whom had exclusive deals with Ubisoft for the release of the game as well as the movie tie in.\nSo what we got is a sloppy port with ridiculous controls that have made the game so far barely playable.\nI've given up until they patch it because its ruining it for me.\nMassive step back for Ubisoft.

My initial impression was that there were going to be TONNES of ways to elude and evade police, hack into criminal networks, and a lot of morally grey choices that would affect the outcome of the game.\n\nUnfortunately, my expectations were probably affected by hype,  as the game offers a very linear story, and 2 ways to affect morality. If you want to be good, don't shoot people or commit crimes. If you want to be bad, shoot people and commit crimes. And the only way this affects gameplay is through police attention. Since I did the entire playthrough as "good", I never encountered a news bulletin or was reported to police by a civillian.\n\nAs an "open world" game, I had been hoping for more, since Ubi is usually pretty good at crafting these. Sadly, all they've delivered is Assassins Creed clone without parkour, and a completely bland protagonist. There are all of 10 types of things to hack in the main overworld, and I found myself causing traffic jams if only to break away from the dull hassle of crossing from one side of the city to another to access missions.\n\nAll in all, Ubi would have been better off setting this in the AC universe. It would have been a lot more fun to be a technology assassin, and ctOS is basically already Abstergo/ The Templars.","June 5, 2014","true","29.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Using a R7 260-X card, 8150 processor, 3.60 GHz. I have yet to have a single problem since i first launched the game. No problems with crashing or freezing and Im running on high settings and runs smoothly. If you have an AMD setup id advise researching your gear first before comitting to buy this game as the devs worked exclusively with nvidia on this.\nUplay hasnt been an issue 'so far' (has in the past), but i still believe it should be phased out to focus their resources elsewhere.\nLike many others i was quite blown away from the E3 trailer in 2012. Comparing that to what we got it is a huge step back in terms of graphic detail and 'realism'. Yes its a bit a dissapointment but for me its really not that big of a deal. I enjoy games for their content and gameplay rather than its 'realism' which seems to a sought after feature these days.\nGameplay wise, if youve played any AC or tom clancy titles they are quite similar such as a basic cover system, weapon and gear selecton, side quests, collectables etc If you like stealth it'll be right up your alley.\n-The hacking feature is pretty simple and not that amazing at first glance but if you play it right you can pull of some pretty  awesome and hilarious moves\n-The parkour movement is quite nice. Being a parkour practioner myself its something i always enjoy seeing.\n-Online game modes are quite fun.\nGive it a few hours and it might suprise you.\n\nThings that arent so great for me.\n-The city really doesnt feel that alive. It does seem quite lifeless\n-THe driving mechanics are very clunky. Mario Kart has better driving mechanics.\n-Characters, voice acting and story are really cliche.\n-Could use more variety in random crimes.\n-Generally feels incomplete\n\nTL;DR-, It is playable and enjoyable but understand there is a lot of room for improvement. Do your research before deciding if its worth buying or at least wait til its patched up a bit.\nAbove average game but not quite what was hyped up to be.    high 6 low 7/10\n\n\n","June 6, 2014","true","43.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

There is lots of variety in the game, for some it may seem like press Q or X or w/e version you're on is like a win button, just press the same button which is kind of true, but depends on what type of style you are going for.\n\nThe missions go from stealth to gunplay to chases and what not, so you are not going stealth to stealth from mission to mission, you get to switch it up often. In terms of side missions, there is LOT of variety for everyone to enjoy. If you don't like shooting up gang members, you can do car takedowns, or play some poker or chess, or do a drinking game, to even playing minigames or getting high on those digital trips ;)\n\nThere is also lots of variety in terms off guns and cars, and you will be presented with a challenge from time to time, depending on difficulty and even on normal you might have trouble. The cops go hard in the paint in this game, they are like terminators who will stop you at all costs and will shoot everytime.\n\nStealth has also been done very well in this game, you can either use the items you craft to kill/distract cards, use the environment or use the items that are on the guards against them like grenades to their comms/headsets. One thing that I would say is driving, it's not AS bad as others make it out to be, but I suck at driving in all games so I cant say much, but one thing they should fix is the handling, almost all cars will spin out on you even if you are not speeding.\n\nAs for Online, I haven't done much online yet, only did decryption and 1v1 hacking and it is pretty good, ofc there are multiple people having problems with that so can't say much for now. I would give this game a 8.5/10, maybe even a 9, only thing holding it back is the driving and also how short the story can be. The main story can be pretty short, reason why you will spend a lot of time is b/c of side activities and probably online.","May 30, 2014","true","54.1"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","21","37","0","2"

The game has been significantly dumbed down (it still looks nice though) since the initial showing at E3 2012. The PC, judging by the performance is definately NOT the lead platform. Lack of blood spatter/blood and car damage is almost non existent. Not had these sorts of issues since the release of BF4. Stuttering is significant, which is consistent when driving at high speeds. Tried all sorts of fixes with little help, but with the long delay of the game these sorts of "fixes" shoudn't even need to be attempted. Settings are all ultra with Temporal SMAA but have tried all low/medium/high. Stuttering is still there so it's not a lack of Vram but the game itself.

In my opinion, this game does not deserve all the hate it got. It is a well crafted game, filled with a lot of innoative and orignal styles of gameplay. This game is nowhere near perfect but is fun nevertheless.\n\nThe story is intriguing, it takes sometime to get into it but once I got into it I didn't want to stop playing. Story is more fun and action packed than meaningful.\n\nOnline is very fun. If not tailing a fixer, you could be decrypting a file with teammates trying to defend off the opponents from stealing the file. The online is very innoative and is addictive.\n\nOverall, calling this game "The Biggest Disappointment of 2014" is not true at all, in fact it could be one of the greatest games of 2014.\n\n8/10","January 13, 2015","true","58.6"," 27 of 49 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","27","49","0","3"

Players couldn't even access the game they paid £39.99 or £44.99 (my case) for, including me. After quite a spectacular flurry of Uplay-related insults, I opened the launcher and to my amazent it worked! So lets get on to the game: The graphics are great but the lighting isn't as good as it was when it was shown at E3 and as you may know, lighting can make a game look really, really fantastic. But the gameplay is what got it for me; the ability to peek into the privacy of people and find out who has herpes or who like to watch hentai. Also, being able to hack traffic lights and various other things such as blockers or spikes to your advantage or just to create some carnage. The game does have some performance issues but I was able to workaround them by switching from fullscreen to borderless in the settings which worked remarkably well and now I can enjoy the game without stuttering. Watch_Dogs also has a large campaign filled with complex and unique characters, but I won't tell you about them... You'll have to find out for yourself. Apart from the campaign, there are various side missions such as the ability to prevent crimes (my favourite), stop convoys or do fixer contracts. Multiplayer is greatly encouraged, and it is actually quite fun without the... connection problems. This review was quite short as I am tired but I rate Watch_Dogs a solid 9/10","May 28, 2014","true","70.7"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","17","30","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rheibe/recommended/243470/","rheibe","Rheibe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rheibe/","118 products in account","Ubisoft is far from being my favourite game developper company, but Watch dog really caught my attention. This review will be as objective as possible.\n\n------------------------[Once you connected to Ubisoft's servers...]------------------------------\n\nPros:\n\n\n- During a mission, you have the choice to play aggressive, using your guns, or more stealthy, using your skills to hack to have an advantage on your ennemies and move while they are being distracted (which is not easy by the way). This remind me a bit of Deus Ex Human Revolution, which it strength was to be able to choose between those two.\n\n- The multiplayer is really good in my opinion. For example, a player could join your session (but you don't know it) and starts hacking you. You then have to find him before he finished is hack. The opponent is disguised as a normal civilian and could be hidden, which make it difficult and stressful, but very exciting.\n\n- Hacking is satisfying. Especially when you neutralize a cop or an other player by destroying his car. There are a lot of stuff to hack around Chicago to stop your opponents, such as traffic lights, steam pipes, blockers, spikes, bridges, and more. You have to be wise though. Hacking requires batteries from your phone so you have to choose carefully.\n\n-There are plenty of skills, distributed in 4 categories: hacking, combat, driving and crafting.You can also invest into Aiden’s focus ability which allows you to combine hacks with combat.\n\n- I haven't completed the first act yet, but I am really attached to the characters already. From where I am in the story, Aiden (you) lost his niece in a car crash because he has been shot by a guy on a motorcycle. I kind of take my mission personally, because I really want to find the dude...\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCons:\n\n- There is mouse acceleration... You deactivate it from the settings, but you can change it threw the .xml file. Here is where you can find it (windows) : C:\Users\UserName\Documents\My Games\Watch_Dogs\ [some numbers] \GameProfile.xml"\nOppen the .xml file with a text editor (I used notepad++). Find  "Sensitivity" and change it to 1, "UseMouseSmooth=" to 0 and also set "Smoothness=" to 0. Lower your game settings for better results.\n\n- The voice acting is somewhat bad. I can't really tell if the synchronization fails or if the animation is bad, but there is something wrong.\n\n- Loading screens takes a while. It's a good thing there aren't that many.\n\n- I've been experiencing annoying graphical bugs, such as lighting/shadow issues. It's like if the shadows are flashing sometimes... it's just really annoying. I also experienced other graphical issues, such as transparent roads. I took a screenshot if it: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=265264257\n\n- The driving system is not fluid/car physics are bad. I don't want to start a war to know which one between GTA V or Watch dog is better, but don't expect the driving system to be as good as GTA...\n\n-ctOS Mobile companion app. What is this? It it suppose to be a mobile app on which you can play a multiplayer mode with people playing the real watch dog. The application is free and you don't need to have watch dog to play it (which is good) but I try to play it since three days now but all it says it's that I can't connect to Ubisoft's server (duh). I tried the tutorial though. You control an helicpter and you chase an other player, who is playing Watch dog, in a car. You want to netralize him before he reaches the final checkpoint by sending cops and hacking stuff. It has the potentiel, really. but hey, I can't play.\n\n- Oh... and U[don't]play...\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinal note:\n\n- I give Watch Dog a 70 out of 100. I would like (really) to give more, but once again, Ubisoft didn't show me they could make a game without bugs and lag and sh*t. However, I still continue playing Watch dog, and I don't regret buying it.","June 1, 2014","true","14.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you have played Farcry 2 its very much the same with the added ably to interact with and object form a distance, you cannot jump just vault which can be problematic a lot of the time is a city landscape so you find your self running around object’s a lot even to a obtaining a vehicle can be hard when NPC do not drive around much or when you call in a vehicle it spawn in the next town over (a 15sec run away). The lead female NPC looks like a splitting image of the female tribesmen from farcry 2. About halfway through the game it’s the same thing over and over, run there have that, run there kill them, and repeat. there is an upgrade system in place it helps  very little by add the ability to interact with object/NPC isn’t that interesting/hardly needed as I found myself ether shot the NPC or following them, want to get rid of the police good luck hacking countless object to stop them bring more on then the copper gets into the action which you have to get rid of first then try to hide undercover somewhere if not take the boat out were the police cannot get you (as there are no police in boats) expect for the copper however with a few shots it leaves. There is a huge gun choose but a few selected gun (Silenced Vector, ACR, Shotgun) will get any job done. Stealthy completing mission’s is not all that hard once you tagged every NPC though a camera, or you go in there guns blazing once the area is clear walk around as you please. Most of side mission are good and more challenging then the main mission but there is one side mission that should have been removed that the drinking game it’s pointless and completing is the other thing, line that circle up and press a button huh! If you fail you start the level again best out of # (5 I think). uPlay next time try a version where you have to run, shoot, drive drunk (Yes some government might have some issues with it as it might condone it, tell them it’s a GAME). other them that that game do have some upside whatever that is running down people, fighting police or going online to verse other hacker in their game there is hours of entertainment.\n\nGetting around: - On Foot: There’s a lot of (semi slow) running, you will spawn at your HQ and have to call in a car at which point you will have to run for about 15sec before you reach it. Would be nice to have a toggle option to hack NPC phones as you pass them on the street rather than having to holding 'Q' every 5secs.\n\n- Vehicles: Cars a uses, get into a powerful car hit the gas and start sliding uncontrollable or get a bomb of a car which putter's around there is no in between . Motorbikes are driveable however try turning at hyper drive speeds with no forces enabled. Boats do not a lot to with the game just going from one side of the city's water bank to the other is about all you will find yourself doing. If I remember rightly this is only 1 or 2 very short mission you will compete on the water. There is NO shooting from the any vehicle makes which makes you use the hack ability to destroy the environment to slow down or kill NPC/police.\n\n- Air: This is no way of getting around via a plan, copper, wing suit, even trying to flap your arms.\n\nAll-in-all:I did enjoy for the most part the game however the game HAD so much potential to become an awesome game but they lack the fundamentals of too days open world games.\n\nSpoiler:There is going to be a Watch Dogs 2, Which will have you shutting down the mob the wanted the server intel which in turn will have them control some parts of the city if not have hackers(gangster) like NPC doing it.","June 27, 2014","false","52.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Since then it's been up and down. For every 'Half Life,' we've had to wade through the muddy waters of disastrous games like 'Daikatana,' 'Trespass' and 'Prince of Persia 3D (ouch).' Recently, I've been doing my fair share of "wading" though, pre-ordering garbage like 'Remember Me,' 'The Bureau: X-Com Declassified' 'Takedown: Red Sabre' and even 'Batman: Arkham Origins.' ...all in the name of eventually being able to play something truly great.\n\nSo, imagine how unbelievably charged I was to find out that I was going to get to play the next 'Half Life' quality game in 'Watch Dogs.' Terms like 'truly emergent gameplay' and 'fully interactive sandbox environment' were used. I was thinking that the game would be something of a cross between 'Splinter Cell,' 'Deus Ex,' 'Max Payne' and 'GTA.' Who knew that in less than 5 hours of gameplay, 'Watch Dogs' would pan out to be nothing more than a watered down 'GTA' combined with a bit of 'Assassin's Creed' with some repetitive hacking for good measure?\n\nWithout saying too much more, I can say this. Based on how this game was released and the overall quality of it, NO ONE should pay more than $40.00 for this game and that's if you have a rig that won't overheat because you turned up the settings to the level that they were supposed to be. If you're looking for anything great, I'd tell you to load up and old GTA game again. But just to help everyone understand. This is NOT the next 'Half Life/Halo/Deus Ex/Arkham City' quality game.\n\nAnd as for this writer, this game represents the LAST PRE-PURCHASE I will ever make. I've finally figured that game review embargoes are the most significant indicator of if a game is worth pre-ordering. If the reviews come out after the game comes out, don't make the purchase until after the game comes out. ...my advice to those who have to be a little tigher with their wallets.\n\nWAIT UNTIL IT GOES ON SALE!!!","May 29, 2014","false","7.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The city and enviornment is stunningly detailed, it's an incredibly immersive place to explore. The multiplayer aspect of it is incredibly fun, being able to invade people's games (and have them seemlessly invade yours) is immensely satisfying. The gameplay elements themselves are also pretty interesting, certianly adds a bit of spice and variety over your usual first-person shooters or sandbox RPGs.\n\nHowever, the engine needs some serious work. Like, serious work. It's certianly shiny in places, but the performance is abysmal (and I have a reasonably decent graphics card). The single-player campaign is also extremely disappointing, mostly due to Aiden Pierce having the personality and emotional capacity of a wooden spoon. There's aspects to the storyline that if emphasised a bit more would have really lent to the story overall, but they were kinda just minor side points and not really explored in any detail.\n\nUltimately, I *can* recommend this game, but not until the price drops a bit more and mostly for the multiplayer and the environment itself. If you're looking for a good plot and emotional storyline however, I suggest looking elsewhere.","August 15, 2014","true","62.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Ubisoft had a huge chance to make bold, truly innovative, game design but instead gave it the "good enough" treatment and reduced anything unique in the game into cheap gimmicks.\n\nHowever, taken at face value, it's still entertaining.\n\nDriving is a bit hard to get used to, and can be wonky at times. Story is pretty cookie cutter, and characters can be kind of bland. Despite all of this, I'm still going to recommend it. There is a TON of content released with the game. While it's true you can zerg through the main story line in probably 6+ hours, there is plenty of fun minigames, and side missions.\n\nAnd as far as graphics go, you can find some nice mods out there that brings it almost up to the E3 level we were originally shown.\n\nGet it on a super cheap sale.\n\n7/10","December 30, 2014","true","70.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nogoodnms/recommended/243470/","nogoodnms","Nogoodnms","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nogoodnms/","380 products in account","Alright, so it took me about four tries of "load more reviews" to get to a positive one, and that was a joke review. So I'm going to make my own review about why I think this game is good.\n\nFirst of all, I have had no issues whatsoever with this game. uPlay worked immediately, as soon as I started this game up (not to say that I don't loathe it like everyone else). No stuttering, no loading issues. Everything ran smoothly, and I'm going on high-to-ultra settings for the most part. I'm working with an Intel i5 4670k, an EVGA GTX 760 SC 4GB, and 16GB of RAM.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this game. Perhaps you could say it didn't live up to _all_ the hype from E3 2012 and 2013, but it lived up to a huge amount of it. The hacking didn't feel ridiculous, cliché or forced, it fit right in. The hacking puzzles became a little repetitive after the first few, but there are more than a few good variations on your typical one in the story missions to keep things interesting.\n\nSpeaking of the story, yes, you can see the plot coming a mile away. Honestly, this could be seen as one of the game's flaws, but I still thought it was good. Did certainly surprise me just a couple of times, especially with Lena's killer and all that happened after you found that out. Post-credits scenes were also very interesting and hinted at a sequel (which there is almost no doubt of it happening, seeing as this has already been declared a new franchise).\n\nDriving gameplay is strange, to say the least. All the cars drive in a peculiar manner, sort of as if they were boats, but not as bad as in GTA IV. You can easily acquire your favorite cars through the in-game cars-on-demand app, unless you're in a mission. Even if you're in a mission, often times you'll still find very good sport/muscle/performance cars just lying around that you can steal. It's very handy.\n\nShooting mechanics were okay. Aim assist is present but able to be turned down or up as much as you want. One flaw I noticed was that you couldn't "hip-fire", or shoot without aiming down using right click. This led to more than a couple of incidents where I was trying to fire my silenced 1911 to quickly kill someone but instead just randomly brought it up and down, which led to me dying. That was infuriating. In general, though, guns feel good. There are a good selection of them too, although the requirement to go do some multiplayer activities to get some of them is a little irritating.\n\nThe multiplayer is something I've only touched on a little bit. I totally suck at online hacking, but it seemed like a really awesome thing if you do it right. Remember, though, the invasion mode isn't the only one. There are multiple other ones, and yes, there is a free roam mode for you to play around in Chicago with your friends.\n\nGraphics... this is something that has been controversial, with the whole downgrade drama going on and such. I'm not the best judge of graphics, but I would have to say that I find this game to be average for the most part. It's best in dialogue cutscenes, when you can really see the detail put into each character's face. Other than that, it's nothing to run home about. I'm sure if you have a good graphics card that can turn it up to maximum settings, it would look even more beautiful.\n\nAll in all, I find this game to be an attractive choice. When you get right down to it, it's a well-polished product that gave you a good image of our increasingly-information-dependent society and the many flaws that that path holds for us. I enjoyed it for its gameplay, graphics, story, and themes, and I think that after all the issues with it die down, people will start to praise it more. I'm probably going to end up buying the Season Pass since T-Bone's backstory holds a lot of interest for me...","May 31, 2014","true","44.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Along with the low framerate, when you experience lag in this game it slows your cursor, making it extremely hard to aim, giving your foes a large advantage over you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cevius/recommended/243470/","Cevius","Cevius<(@)>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cevius/","441 products in account","Many people have likened Watch Dogs to GTA with Hacking, but after several hours playing with it, I would say that it is more akin to Sleeping Dogs or Just Cause (or Just Cause 2) or Far Cry 3. Its a sandbox world with a unique twist and enough story to keep you going on.\n\nThe Graphics are fantastic, and the aesthetics of this virtual Chicago wonderful to behold. In all other sandbox games, the world is designed by a small group of game devs, but the street and building layout in WD takes the organic nature of the real world and makes it digital. The effect is brilliant, with almost no elements of the city feeling like cookie cutter copies of anything which for a world this large is fantastic.\n\nMuch like Sleeping Dogs though, while the image of the world is colourful and fascinating, the longer you stare at it, the more you see of the brush-strokes behind it, mostly in the form of the AI, the pre-set conversations found randomly and through hacking, and the similarity of the missions.\n\nEven with its flaws though, it is still great fun and I feel even with 20 hours or so of gameplay so far, that there is many more hours of enjoyment left.\n\nOne caveat is that controls for PC are nigh unusable with keyboard and mouse to the point where I failed the first mission multiple times due to spending most of my time fighting the controls rather than learning the basics. Mouse aiming seems almost like they have taken the X/Y Movement and translated that to the Joystick look values. I tried for about 20 minutes to find the right sensitivity setting between my Logitech G9x and ingame before I could get anything even partially usable. Keyboard controls were better, but like many games that were build with console as the primary focus, attempting to drive with WSAD gives you so little fine control that keeping your vehicle on the road is very difficult. Combine this with some of the vehicles driving like a nitro boosted shopping trolley full of pedestrian seeking missiles, and suddenly those driving missions are impossible. Jump to a 360 controller and everything is instantly fine.\n\nThe poorness of the Mouse look though makes me wonder if a single play-tester tried using a mouse, as it should have come up pretty early on that it wasn't usable. Perhaps they did and nobody listened with the game already being delayed so long. As for the vehicle issues, I haven't played any sandbox games in the past few years that don't suffer the same issues, so I wonder greatly how many players out there without gamepads get a sense of disappointment for these games, not realising there is another way.\n\nThe online elements seem to blend seamlessly with other players hacking me, and me hacking them back without too many technical issues. Only one other player has had network issues while playing that affected the mission when they dropped out, but in a heavily connected world, even when they dropped, it just seemed like a malfunction in the game world, rather than a technical issue in the real one.\n\nAll in all, the game is damn good fun, the story interesting enough to want to continue, and the side missions varied and spontaneous enough to make me feel like budget iBatman, protecting the citizens one nightstick to the knee at a time.\n\nRating 7.8/10","May 31, 2014","true","32.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Henry_Reed/recommended/243470/","Henry_Reed","Henry Reed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Henry_Reed/","131 products in account","In a nutshell, Watch Dogs is a terribly optimized console port with downgraded graphics, repetitive game mechanics, pathetic storyline and non-innovative gameplay. Is it worth the sixty bucks it is being sold for? No. Does it look pretty? Yes, but it was downgraded to ♥♥♥♥. Is it the gruesome, drama-filled vigilante-justice game that was advertised? No.  It’s a Frankenstein version of Assassin’s Creed, mixed with Far Cry 3 and topped with Splinter Cell Blacklist. There is zero innovation, except maybe the hacking mechanics (which are just gimmicks).\n\nYou play as a burly, white dude called Aiden Pierce, who has as much character depth as my rear end (none). His niece died (women-in-the-fridge trope) so he decides to go on a revenge trip. He is proficient in social engineering, computer science, hand-to-hand combat, every single military weapon/self-defense tool ever made in human history, driving both cars and motorcycles and parkour. He is unbeatable and utterly boring, in a nutshell — a Mary Sue. So we see two tropes being used so far, the woman-in-the-fridge trope and Mary Sue. But wait, there’s more! Not only does it use those incredibly over-used tropes that every movie, video game and book is following but a few hours through the game will get Aiden’s sister kidnapped, so now we got THREE tropes, including DAMSEL IN DISTRESS! Glorious storyline, that’s for sure.\n\nLet’s move on to the gameplay. The driving mechanics are b0llocks. It is incredibly arcade-like — the game doesn’t follow laws of physics. You can drive through objects, hit cars, hit street-lamps (and somehow break them off) without being slowed down. Turning is unrealistic and it feels like driving on ice. The game suffers from low view distance, making it near impossible to drive at high speeds without crashing into objects that appear a few meters away from you. You can also hack cars. I am serious; you can hack cars and get into them. However, you still hear Aiden putting the cars keys in even though you “hacked” the car.\n\nCops are idiotic. If a civilian calls the police because a criminal is shooting, the cops will ignore the criminal and will attack you (even if you haven’t done anything).\n\nThe shooting is very generic, think Splinter Cell Blacklist. Hand-to-hand combat is non-existent. You just press the F key to beat people down and somehow disable them by incorrectly using a baton. (Aiden swings his arm backwards and hits people even though he is supposed to swing the baton from his chest. It’s incorrect to swing the baton far back behind yourself due to the fact that you can hit objects on the way and it makes it extremely simple for your opponent to block your attack. Thankfully the enemies in Watch Dogs are downright ret@rded and know nothing about blocking).\n\nThe hacking comes in handy but it just feels like a perk rather than a full fleshed-out game mechanic. Most of the time you will be doing a ridiculous hacking mini-game which doesn’t even remotely resemble real-life hacking (at least they could’ve made it look realistic but they just put in a water-pipe mini-game).\n\nThe city feels alive, so they got that right. It looks remotely similar to Chicago. It is nowhere near how it actually looks like but it’s close. I don’t find that a problem since Ubisoft’s goal wasn’t to copy and paste real-life Chicago into the game. However, there is one problem that I found in the virtual Chicago. In any gun store in you can buy weaponry such as .50 caliber sniper rifles or pump-action grenade launchers. In Chicago, Illinois. Apparently Ubisoft was too lazy to add black market stores so they just took regular gun stores and added illegal weaponry in. I don’t see the point of it anyway, why couldn’t there be just hand-guns and a few rifles? Why did they have to shove in military-grade weaponry?\n\nAll in all, the game is average. It looks pretty, despite the downgrade, runs like ♥♥♥, despite Ubisoft’s claim that PC is the lead platform, has decent gameplay, ignoring that it is a mix of Ubisoft’s previous games, and has an average story, if you manage to ignore the tropes and terrible dialog.\n\nIf you still want this game, either pirate it from a reliable warez group (such as nosTEAM) or buy it on a sale (keep in mind, Assassin’s Creed 1, a Ubisoft game, is still 20 dollars despite being seven years old, so don’t expect a cheap price).","June 30, 2014","false","58.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I know some people (a LOT of people) are having serious game breaking issues and this has led to more negativity than I have ever seen aimed at a game.\n\n*I am also acutely aware of how poor the game looks compared to some footage of the game we were shown at E3*\n\nHowever I appear to be one of the lucky ones, I have no problems in game with graphics, stuttering or mouse lag/acceleration issues. (or as has been pointed out, I don't notice I am suffering mouse problems)\n\nI am enjoying the campaign thus far,  I like the characters and their development.  I also find the story line although not new, entertaining.\n\nI like the game mechanics which are fairly varied and unique.\n\nShooting and combat in general is great fun and I find the cover and move system both highly useful and intuitive.  It genuinely feels great to fire a gun and better to have those bullets land on a nice soft mushy meat target.\nThe guns also sound great!\n\nHacking and stealth camera hopping is great, from hacking into conversations and sms chats, stealing bank account information to exploit later to jumping into the city's CCTV network and stealthly checking out objects and carrying out remote hacks.\n\nDriving for me, someone who is neither used to nor interested in realistic driving simulators or someone who does much driving in games at all it's o.k.  It's easy and is a means to get from A to B (fast travel exsists between locations and your hide outs or to campaign start points).  I can certainly see why people dislike the driving as it is so easy and you feel disconected from the experiance due to the poor/shoody physics and weightless cars.\n\nThere are many, many sub games and 'side missions' and these will generate many hours of enjoyable play time whilst not pursuing the main story.\n\nOverall, as stated I am enjoying playing Watch_Dogs greatly.  I am satisfied with what I got for my £45 (Digi Deluxe Ed.)\n\nI think we need to be realistic in our expectations,  I am not saying we should accept sub-standard games and out right false advertising/wilfull mis representation of graphics or game content but we cannot expect a game 'AAA' or otherwise to simply fall off the shelf and be 100% from day one.\n\nHopefully ubisoft fix the big issues quickly and those having trouble playing get to enjoy the game for what it is.\n\nFinal marks for me would be 7.5/10","May 29, 2014","true","106.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The main reason for it this time, is the games constant successful attempts at distracting the player. The distractions are fun for the most part, but once you get used to being taken for a ride so to speak, the games incessant reminders once they're over can become astoundingly annoying. Do any side mission or online hacking to completion and you'll be reminded to keep on track with the campaign by it's intro phone call telling you whats next. From about the fifth time onwards these can become maddening, so much so you either do them, or initiate another online function just to shut them hell up. Distract me sure, but don't punish the player with repetitive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t for wanting to do them! The story is well acted and well scripted, but i find spreading it out a 30 hour campaign over 90 to 100 hours or more is the death knell for what could have been. STORY 6/10\n\nThat aside, the main attraction gameplay wise for me has been the online hacking. I haven't been able to play a game yet where i simply play to complete the story, without being coaxed into an online session. It's a 1 vs 1 where you can't kill the other player, but they can kill you. You initiate a hack, run and hide (or not) and the other player does all they can to find and kill you. The feeling of nearly, not quite, but almost being discovered is genuinely some of the most exciting multiplayer sessions i've ever had. Finding smart players and dumb as ♥♥♥♥ players is always a treat. Even when they run, or when they discover you and fail at killing you before you find a car and bolt is simply amazing fun. Other modes have not piqued my interest enough for me to enjoy them. ONLINE 9/10\n\nUbisofts lies regarding this games graphics and their ♥♥♥♥stick practices with system parity and patching it are well known now so i won't go into it. Suffice to say = 0/10 ♥♥♥♥ you ubisoft.\n\nGraphically, when this game is fully modded with a decent contrast and sharpening with a sweetfx preset and TheWorse mod on, it's simply the most beautiful, atmospheric, intoxicating game around today. A true next gen experience if there is such a thing with current hardware. The sunsets, fog and weather effects, wind, lighting and shadows are simply stunning. Well worth upgrading to see and play this on full settings. 7/10 ubisoft vanilla / 9.5/10 modded.\n\nI'm not sure why people have complained about the driving model and physics for the vehicles, as i found like any game it depends on which car you get into will make the experience. Good car, good experience and so on. It's fun as hell. 8/10\n\nThe gunplay is competent as any other third person shooter and definitely better than GTA's. 8/10\n\nApart from the unfortunate pairing of publisher and developer talent i can certainly recommend this game and look forward to the New Jersey expansion!","August 4, 2014","true","102.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Okay, leaving that a side thanks to camera hacking you are able to prevent crimes as Aiden himself is some sort of vigilante who is in pursuit of justice by any means.\n\nAs a good open world game the city is huge and there is a lot of extra activities to complete going from completing like target elimination, taking gangs down, stopping armed convoys, poker games, drinking games, distracting the police, virtual trips and the good old collectibles hunt (Audios, QR Codes, hidden packages, privacy invasions and more). Completing all of the side activities will probably will take more time than completing the main story.\n\nAnd last but not least there is the occasional "hacker invasion" which is a multiplayer mode where another player can connect to your game to steal your information which happens in certain time frame and it is your job to find the hacker and avoid your information being retrieved, of course it can happen the other way around where you can get into somebody else's game and get their information which in the end sums up to getting more ingame money after a successful invasion.\n\nOne of the downsides of this game (as any other new Ubisoft games) is how poorly graphically optimized is; presenting unnecessary slowness in some areas making the game harder to play. Thanks to a modder you improve the game performance and looks at the same time using the Worse mod, which will improve the framerate and lighting around the game making the world around you more eye catching.\n\nIf you are coming to this game expecting a GTA, well wrong place as this can be a censored version of it, there is no civilian killing, explosions all around and all of the stuff GTA is known for; instead you have a city to hack by hacking money out of random people's accounts while they walk on the street to escaping from the cops using the city stop lights, doing blackouts and everything to your disposal.\n\nSo, ready to hack Chicago city and help Aiden find his answers?... well, what are you waiting for? go get it...","May 1, 2015","true","44.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VeloxFox/recommended/243470/","VeloxFox","VeloxFox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VeloxFox/","129 products in account","I got this on sale, hoping that the only issue was that gamers were just dissapointed that the graphics in the actual game are nowhere near as good as demonstrated at E3.  Sadly, this game as a number of serious flaws.\n\nIssues:\n- Worst driving 'physics' of any game I have ever played.  I though people were exagerating when they said it was like bumper cars on ice.  High-performance cars are almost completely uncontrolable.  I don't think anyone at Ubisoft has ever driven a car.  This makes even the simplist of driving missions impossibly difficult.  This, coupled by the cop's ability to stick to you like glue, and you're in for the most frustrating experience of your life.\n\n- Uplay.  Yes, even though it's a Steam game, it launches through Uplay.  Not only that, but you have to register your game key with uplay, and if you have DLC, register those keys as well.  It's a very cumbersome and unnecessary process.  To make matters worse, the Uplay overlay causes the game to crash on loading.  The result is that Uplay makes the game completely unplayable.\n\n- Bug with key remaping.  It's shocking that in this day and age, something as simple and obvious as this is broken.  Rebinding the keys (I use ESDF) causes the game to think that there are unbound actions, even if everything is bound.  This means that in order to rebind your keys, you have to accept the bindings, when it warns you that keys are unbound, you have to go back.  Thankfully, going back saves your kemaps, so you have to Alt-F4 OUT OF THE GAME in order to save you keybindings.  This means that you CANNOT rebind your keys while playing (for example, if a key binding turns out to be inconvenient)\n\n- Performance is absolutally abismal.  I have an i7-3770k with 2x7970 in crossfire.  I can easly play Shadow of Morrdor in my Eyefinity resoution of 5880x1080.  I was forced to go back down to 1080p in order to get this game to run at even remotely playable framerates without constant hitching and stuttering.  Of course, this would be understandible if the graphics were amazing, but they are not.  GTA 4 (not 5, but 4) looks better than this game, and has much better performance.\n\nPros:\n- Didn't kill my cat\n- Was on sale, so I didn't waste $60 on this thing.\n\nTo sum things up, it seems that Ubisoft is riding on it's name alone at this point.  They haven't even attempted to optimise this game for the PC, and have critical, game-breaking issues unaddressed.  The overall concept is good, but it needs a LOT of work in order to go from the garbage it is now to an amazing franchise.","July 3, 2015","false","64.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

To see what it actually looks like I would recommend looking at Videos on YouTube rather than trusting the Steam Screenshots or Trailers.\n\nIf you´re the Type who likes to explore the Map, do Side Missions try out the Multiplayer and Mix it up with the Main Story you should easily get around 30 Hours of fun out of this Game.\nThe Main Story is alright, but the Characters didn´t manage to really hook me in like in some compareable Story driven Open World Games like GTA, Sleeping Dogs or even Saints Row. Still it was a nice Experience and for the most Part the Missions had variety and didn´t have too many frustrating Moments.\nThe Side-Missions even if you don´t like certain Types of them should still have enough types for there to be something you enjoy.\n\nI personally think that the Mechanics of the Game even tho they didn´t have anything evolutionary are all solid and alot of fun to use aswell in and out of Missions.\nIn 90% of the Missions you can decide wether you feel like going in with a Boom or if you prefer to go for a stealth approach which i enjoyed alot (I´m usually not too much into stealth but it was alot of fun in this game) and if you fail the Stealth way you can simply switch to your Primary Weapons and try to finish the Rest of with that.\n\nThe Multiplayer: I personally don´t like the Way Invasions are usually playing out and how hacking/trailing (invading) other People are feeling but that is something very objective considering I know about people who enjoy those very much.\nAdded to that the Game has a Mode which sets you and up to 8 others into a certain Area of a Map to fight over some Data (switches between FFA and Team Modes) this can be quite fun to play but isn´t really fleshed out so this won´t be something you´ll be spending alot of time on. There is also online Races which are actually my Favorite Part of the Multiplayer, these are also up to 8 Players (never had more than 4 so far tho) but are alot of Fun with the arcade-like driving System of the Game.\nThen as last theres also Free-Roam in which you can just go ahead and explore the World with your Friends. In that Mode you cannot play any Missions or such but with a little creativity you can have alot of Fun (Me and two Friends for example made up our own Cops and Robber Mode in which 2 People would Chase one Person around the City in Police cars and his Task was to escape them) (Cops are enabled in Free-Roam but you killing civilians will not ruin your reputation so it is a good mode to just mess around which the game usually doesn´t reward you for in Singleplayer)\n\nI did definitly enjoy my Time and get my Moneys worth of Time with it.\nFor those who aren´t really sure wether they need this Game in their Lives (or around 30 Hours are worth the Price) I would recommend to wait for a good Chance to maybe get the Game for a cheaper Price than 59,99€ (Amazon has the Normal Version for less Money but no Steam Key attached for those who don´t care)","June 1, 2014","true","51.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VeloxFox/recommended/243470/","VeloxFox","VeloxFox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VeloxFox/","129 products in account","I got this on sale, hoping that the only issue was that gamers were just dissapointed that the graphics in the actual game are nowhere near as good as demonstrated at E3.  Sadly, this game as a number of serious flaws.\n\nIssues:\n- Worst driving 'physics' of any game I have ever played.  I though people were exagerating when they said it was like bumper cars on ice.  High-performance cars are almost completely uncontrolable.  I don't think anyone at Ubisoft has ever driven a car.  This makes even the simplist of driving missions impossibly difficult.  This, coupled by the cop's ability to stick to you like glue, and you're in for the most frustrating experience of your life.\n\n- Uplay.  Yes, even though it's a Steam game, it launches through Uplay.  Not only that, but you have to register your game key with uplay, and if you have DLC, register those keys as well.  It's a very cumbersome and unnecessary process.  To make matters worse, the Uplay overlay causes the game to crash on loading.  The result is that Uplay makes the game completely unplayable.\n\n- Bug with key remaping.  It's shocking that in this day and age, something as simple and obvious as this is broken.  Rebinding the keys (I use ESDF) causes the game to think that there are unbound actions, even if everything is bound.  This means that in order to rebind your keys, you have to accept the bindings, when it warns you that keys are unbound, you have to go back.  Thankfully, going back saves your kemaps, so you have to Alt-F4 OUT OF THE GAME in order to save you keybindings.  This means that you CANNOT rebind your keys while playing (for example, if a key binding turns out to be inconvenient)\n\n- Performance is absolutally abismal.  I have an i7-3770k with 2x7970 in crossfire.  I can easly play Shadow of Morrdor in my Eyefinity resoution of 5880x1080.  I was forced to go back down to 1080p in order to get this game to run at even remotely playable framerates without constant hitching and stuttering.  Of course, this would be understandible if the graphics were amazing, but they are not.  GTA 4 (not 5, but 4) looks better than this game, and has much better performance.\n\nPros:\n- Didn't kill my cat\n- Was on sale, so I didn't waste $60 on this thing.\n\nTo sum things up, it seems that Ubisoft is riding on it's name alone at this point.  They haven't even attempted to optimise this game for the PC, and have critical, game-breaking issues unaddressed.  The overall concept is good, but it needs a LOT of work in order to go from the garbage it is now to an amazing franchise.","July 3, 2015","false","64.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

This game is very controversial and a lot of gamers (myself included) aren't too happy with ubisoft lately.  I'm a huge fan of open world games, so I knew I had to try watchdogs when I heard about it.  The city is detailed, vibrant, and full of life. The voice acting and visuals are crips and belivable, while the story is interesting and kept me coming back for more.  As someone who has dabbled in legal hacking and penetration testing, I was curious to find out if they would do their research on what hacking really is. Sure, the hacking mini games aren't "actual" hacking, but they are enjoyable and don't get in the way too often.  Many people complain about the whole "cell-phones can't be used for hacking!" thing. While this is mainly true, most penetration testers do use Android for some of their tasks. Either way, Aiden has gotten access to the main systems and has a house full of expensive server hardware that is the back end for what he does on his phone. Believable? Sure!   The only other thing gamers complained about, was Ubisoft saying they would downgrade this game to match its console brothers. It looked great with max settings at 2560X1440 on my system, but there is a mod you can install to make it look even better. If you like open world games, pick this up. You won't be dissapointed.\n\n-PR0XIDIAN","March 29, 2015","true","25.1"," 27 of 50 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","27","50","0","1"

That was quite possibly one of the most depressing games I've played in a long time, but I felt compelled to finish it because I thought there would be some resolution or it would improve at some point.\n\nInstead, your family is gone, the only other character you are attached to dies, the head of the "bad guys" company is running for office, and CTOS goes global.\n\nI find myself wondering what the actual F was the point of all this?\n\nThis is on top of the most horrible driving physics I've ever seen, glitchy graphics, glitchy spawning, stupid pedestrians that insist on throwing themselves in FRONT of your vehicle...mini-vans handle better than sports cars, and riding a motorcycle feels like I'm in a John Woo movie.\n\nThere are many things in this game which are just flat-out broken.  I had scripted combat scenes where the enemy NPC's didn't spawn where they were supposed to...the spawn points kept changing, and sometimes I even got the "boss" spawn on top of the regular spawn.  There was even a scene where when I died, I respawned on a different freaking floor, and had to run back up the stairs and through fire just to get to my escort.\n\nThe "catching criminals" mechanic while obviously intended as part of the core theme felt shallow and almost tacked-on, which brings me to another gripe...holy mother of god the UI spam.  Constantly getting pop-up messages telling me to go places and do various bits, which were very repetitive and seemed to only serve the purpose of a time sink.  This one thing alone, the UI spam, was pretty aggravating.  Even with all the "online" features disabled, I was still getting pop-ups to do online races.\n\nEven the "filler" side-mission crap is total garbage.  Here you have this hyper-realstic city environment going on, and you throw in this stupid 3-d space invaders and Mario chasing coins crap?  Who thinks stuff like this is a good idea?\n\nReading through the ridiculously lengthy credits afterwards, I was left wondering with all those people how did they manage to not have any QA at all?\n\nIf I had paid full price for this I would be seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Luckily I grabbed it on sale with the DLC(why did I bother) for only $15.  I'll never buy another Ubisoft game again.\n\nEdited for minor spelling errors.","March 26","false","25.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

Nearly two years later, I finally got my hands on the game and plowed right through the campaign; and I have to say, it's definitely a good game. I can't say when Ubisoft patched it so the performance issues are no longer there, but the game runs perfectly fine.\n\nNow, the game itself. Watch Dogs is a good game and a great new IP for Ubisoft to play with. It was definitely a breath of fresh air after constant releases of Assassin's Creed and Far Cry games. The story revolves around Aiden Pearce, othwerwise known as "The Vigilante" or "Fox", as he tries to uncover who put out a hit on him that led to the death of his niece. Aiden is a professional hacker and utilizes his knowledge to hack his way into the ctOS where he's able to track his targets. It's a well written story with a number of unique characters, twists and turns, a great soundtrack from the guy that worked on Hannibal, great graphics, great animation, shocking scenes in the ghetto; all around, great game.\n\n9.4/10","April 22","true","31.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Lets just judge it for what it is and not what we thought it would be.\n\nPros:\n\n-Good handling, default controls worked out nicely for me, i cant really speak for you guys but i can for me.\n\n-Open world, lots of places to look around and chase your freinds (explained later)\n\n-Random Crimes, some find this feature repeditive but it is nice to just drive around looking for crimme instead of just going to the next mission.\n\n-Skill tree, its a skill tree, no explanation required.\n\n-Great graphics, the game looks fantastic.\n\n-Multiplayer, people can join your game and try to hack you or you can invite your freinds to prove to them that you are better than them, or vise versa.\n\n-Driving, you dont have to walk everywhere, at least thats true.\n\n-Focous, bullet-time, enter the matrix\n\n-several payment methods for stores, you can simply siphon some money from a guy outside, you can simply pay with what you have from contracts, or you can take a more direct rout and pay with the threat of violence.\n\n-Cover, no more bullet eating for me.\n\n-Unique weapons, there are special unlockable weapons that feel more like game breakers, but hey, a 1 shot sniper rifle that makes those peski police choppers go away is good by me.\n\n-hacking, you can go through an entire mission without actualy shooting or hitting someone, just make them explode by doing something with your phone, patrolling enemy solved.\n\nReview getting long? sorry, lots to say.\n\nCons:\n\n-Uplay, its annoying how this is required, but deal with it, i say its worth it for this game. (and as an addition you can get uplay rewards, so a really useful car and other things which im still working on getting)\n\n-The fact that intrutions seem to happen all the time, so if your into single player only, just turn off the setting in the options.\n\n-The radio usualy has nothing good on, so you might want to turn off the radio or make your own playlist.\n\n-Price, for what this game is i would say its worth $30 at most, so wait for a good sale to come along, you never know.\n\n-mouse gesture menues, just hook up a controller, it will go better.\n\nConclution:\nThis game is fine, just a bit over priced and the fact that nobody seems to like it for what it is, The pros far outweigh the cons, just not for $40, i recomend a sale that is 50% or more.","July 28, 2015","true","35.7"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","13","23","0","0"

This game is not what everyone is telling you, and is not, "awful" but it certainly did NOT, live up to the hype, then again when did any game live up to the hype? Anyways I will get down to the point.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are, acceptable, and, (in my opinion) are not the worst thing ever. But they're not the kind of, "standing out" graphics everyone thought they would be.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay was, unique, I dont think I have any other words to discribe it. We all want, "new ideas" but this is what happens. It was fun for a few hours, but got very repetitive later in the game. Also, there were not as many options to hack in the game, sure there was alot of places to hack, but, placing the same hack over and over in different places is just not what we wanted. Also I want to point out that the physics in this game are downright awful. As well as the glitchy car damage system.\n\nThere is also some side missions to do in the game, but it more turned out quantity over quality. To much of the same thing, and there were barely any side missions that caught my attention.\n\nStory: The story was flawed in so many ways I cant really discribe it, other than that Aidan is the worst main character I've seen in a while, he seems to show no emotion and causes more damage and deaths than any other character does.\n\nConclusion: The game is not awful, and presents new mechanics that no one has ever seen in gaming before. But it isn't perfect either. If you're thinking of buying the game, wait for a sale, its not worth even close to its original price. So, I bet you're thinking that you really dont want to buy this game now, but despite my fairly negative review the game itself was, Fun.\n\nThanks for reading my review.","November 19, 2014","true","128.1"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

I could spot almost no difference between low and ultra settings.\n\nContent-wise, I enjoyed the game. The digital trips and mini games were fun and the world was a thrill to explore.\n\nThe story was not very well written and the it is a simple story of revenge and the Aiden is not a very interesting or deep character; nothing makes you like him all that much except ,maybe for a little sympathy. At the end, when I learn what who was behind it all, I was not surprised, in fact I predicted that they were behind it. However, when I finished the story content, it was never boring to role play and create my own adventures\n\nThe I enjoyed combat and it a little tactical. Planting bombs before the fight, using lures, grenades,IED's, etc. The cover system was well done. When I was in a fight, I felt as if in one of those action movies as opposed to standing behind a wall and moving left and right for cover. The different types of enemies possed different challenges for example taking care of heavily armored thugs was no simple task as they could soak up as many bullets as you could fire at them. All this amounted to making the combat more realistic.\n\nThe police chases are not easy and they differ froms other games because of this. In other games, throwing the police of your tail is not much of a challenge however in Watch Dogs, I think twice when I am about to do something that may attract police attention, due to persistence of the police. However there is a small loophole to evade the police but that is better left unsaid...or discovered.\n\nThe side missions were enjoyable and they made me feel like a real action hero however some of these side missions became repetitive and less appealing over time.\n\nOverall I think watchdogs was a well done game content-wise that could have seen much more tech improvement and a stronger story. It has a great open world and the hacking was fun to create mayhem and unique methods of attack and/or escape or just a little fun. All these features make Watch Dogs a fun game which will leave you with a memorable experience\n\n\nP.S.

The hype might have been a little too much, but overall this is a great game. Definitely would be stupid to pass this up.\n\nI think most of the issues people have with this game is they try to look at it as a "GTA Clone". I wouldn't say it's far from a GTA clone, but they hold GTA on a pedestal and try to relate all the features of this game to GTA. In my eyes this game is a field all on its own, and deserves alot more respect than what people are giving it.\n\nI can safely say I'll be playing this for quite a while and will most certainly go down as one of my favorites.

I dislike that this game is somewhat unfinished and the driving physics aren't well detailed like Grand Theft Auto IV and Mafia II, plus $59.99 is way to priecy for a game like this that isn't well finished, If it was then I personally believe it would be fair but in this case.....yeah no....that is just bogus. They definitly could've done better on this and I wish that they did.\n\nIf they happen to be making a Watch_Dogs 2 then what they should do is have it take place in Las Vegas Nevada. Detail the game to where you can derp, walk around in casino's, do your own thing, etc. Detail it enough to where you can go on random floors of casino's and mess around at will, hack slot machines for big payouts for yourself or for other players or for random civilins in the game, or play the slot machines, poker, cards, and any other gambling games you can do regularly. They should also make it detailed to the point where you can walk around the Las Vegas strip, put in random events you can attend, buy/rent a suite or regular hotel room with a view of the strip make it to where you can buy/rent a house, condominium or rent a apartment of any kind and where you could customize it to fit your needs and the car physics should be that of which of Mafia II and be able to sell them for more money $$$ in the game to add up to get nicer things. Now that would be a game worth $59.99, I would surely enjoy something like that. <3\n\nAnyways I would still recommend this game but only get it when it goes on sale. If your a person like me who loves blowing stuff up, causing havoic, chaos and shooting stuff up or doing your own thing at will then this is a game for you.","November 9, 2014","true","39.0"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","20","37","0","3"

But will you want to play this or just stick with GTA ?\n\nIn Watch Dogs you control Aiden Pearce. After a job that goes wrong Aiden get's a hit placed on him, but instead of him dying his niece dies instead. Driven by rage Aiden set's out to find out who placed the hit on him and who are the people who killed his niece.\n\nGameplay wise this is a sandbox type game where you can do whatever you want to do. The game does put a little twist on the whole thing and let's you hack anything in the world. Traffic lights, bridges, explosives, camera's. Anything goes in this world. The hacking is simple. All you do is press a button and then the thing you wanted to hack is hacked. The driving is by far the worst driving in a sand box games I've seen to date. The physics feel floaty and it's just hard to control the car. The gunplay is also kind of mediocre. The guns have massive recoil, so you have to let out the shot's in short bursts, but once you get used to it, it's not that bad. There's also a mini game that happens from time to time where you have to rotate pipes so a blue bar fills the entire screen ( sort of like the pipe puzzle from Bioshock).\n\nThe soundtrack is this games weakest point. The radio music is a horrible choice of music and when I got in a vehicle, I would always turn off the radio. The game music is pretty badass on the other hand. I loved some of the tracks that played during gun fights and chase sequences.\n\nGraphics are okay for the most part. There were a few moments when the game looked awful, but for the most part it looks great. There are a lot of moments when the game has texture pop ins. When you set the game to max settings it looks great.\n\nThe game took me 24 hours to finish every side quest and main quest. I felt this was a perfect amount of time and I felt I got my money's worth. But I don't recommend getting this game at full price.\n\nNow for the side quests. They range from different things like: Stopping a crime, destroying a criminal convoy, taking out gang leaders and racing through the streets of Chicago. Some of the contracts do get boring cause they never change and nothing new happens in them.\n\nThe city while not as massive as GTA 5, is still pretty big. There's a lot to explore and sights to see. The map is design really well, but there are a few problems in level design when you go inside buildings cause sometimes it does get quite confusing, but nothing horrible.\n\nSome of the missions get pretty tough, but nothing incredibly hard, but overall the game is really easy.\n\nThe game is still really buggy. As mentioned before the texture pop ins happen in game and in cutscenes. I had a bug where a door to a mission didn't open and it forced me to reload to checkpoint, but that fixed it.\n\nOverall Watch Dogs is a pretty fun game despite it's flaw's. I do suggest getting this game at a discount and you will have some fun with it. I give Watch Dogs a 8/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","September 27, 2015","true","35.7"," 22 of 41 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","22","41","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/recommended/243470/","badwhippet","Moonwind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/","568 products in account","Watch_dogs is a HUGE game: huge open-world map, huge number of missions and a long length of game.  The story campaign is varied and interesting, and the characters are very well developed (though perhaps a little under-used).  The game has a colossal number of side missions but most of these tend to become a bit repetitive after a while (fortunately, they're optional).  The AI enemies are intelligent enough to flank you (they don't 'reset to patrol' after a given time unlike other games).  You'll often have the choice to play by stealth or confrontation.\n\nAs for visual quality, there have been a lot of comparisons between the game and its promotional video at E3.  Don't be fooled though; just because it's not as detailed, it still has a fantastic level of quality.  The control options are excellent too: Ubisoft has coded the game to detect whatever you're using and switch to it immediately, so you can (if you wish) use the mouse to aim and shoot, and gamepad for driving.  The best of both worlds.  If only other games did this.\n\nThere are various problems with the game: poor performance dogs high-end nvidia cards (780Ti, Titan etc), it doesn't like SLI/Crossfire and the DLC often doesn't materialise.   Frustrations aside, it is still a quality game, but do ensure you meet the requirements as it's a very demanding game too.","July 1, 2014","true","311.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is by no means some new generation never-seen-before wonderland it was so unbelivably hyped up to be, if anything its played it absolutely safe. Take a bit of GTA, mix a bit of Deus Ex, liberally sprinkle some Asassins Creed, make nods toward popular scifi/cyberpunk.. you get the jist. As it is it makes for a good game, but compared to the freedom offered in simmilar games, there just doesn't seem enough depth or content around the city and you start realising that theres very few vehicles to choose from, fewer enterable buildings than simmilar games, and after a while the city starts to feel quite small., its sterile.\n\nGraphically it looks nice, but I'm certainly not blown away, I'd say it's just slightly better than GTA IV!\n\nAnd then theres Uplay.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LDR/recommended/243470/","LDR","Kiksu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LDR/","183 products in account","Having recently finished Watch_Dogs I figured it might be worth writing a review, to help other would-be buyers out.  First off I should say Watch_Dogs will be my last pre-order ever (at least, certainly my last Ubisoft pre-order ever).  Having been blown away by the E3 gameplay trailers and subsequent previews I duly paid up for the Deluxe Edition a few weeks before the release date.  In the days leading up to launch I started to get a bit worried.  There were stories flying round that the E3 demo was not representative of the final product.  That review embargos were being enforced because, after all the hype, the game was a bit rubbish.  Thankfully the latter was not true (but more on that later), though the former quite clearly was.  I won't be pre-ordering again because, even after a six month delay to polish the game, I feel Ubisoft released an un-optimised PC product.\n\nThe bad first then.  I can't quite buy into the conspiracy theory that Ubisoft purposefully downgraded the PC version of the game at the request of Sony or Microsoft, to make their next gen consoles look better.  But recent tweaks by modders to unlock vastly superior graphical effects make it hard to ignore something must have been done.  I've been using TheWorse's graphics mod and the game looks so much better (the lighting, rain and explosions are incredible), runs so much smoother and suffers slightly less of the crippling stuttering which has plagued many players.\n\nThe stuttering is incredibly frustrating and it’s difficult to pin down the cause.  I'm running an i7-3770K (overclocked to 4.5GHz) a 2GB Geforce 680 GTX with 16GB of DDR3 system RAM and get between 50-60 FPS most of the time (I’m running with everything maxed out except textures, on “High” and anti-aliasing, lowered to correspond to my graphics cards RAM).  However, every now and then the frame rate drops dramatically at seemingly random points turning the game into a slide show.  I can live with this in single-player, but when in a multiplayer race or decryption mission it really irks.  I'm still hoping Ubisoft patch this out (the first patch didn't make a great deal of difference), but I'm not sure what their ongoing commitment to this game is.\n\nSo why do I recommend this game?  Because on balance the game is excellent.  The core of the game, the main story missions, the hacking, the shooting mechanics, the driving, the parkour movement through the city, are all very, very good.  I've heard complaints that people don't like the main character, Aiden.  I didn't have a problem with him personally.  I found him to be a little bit of a sociopath, which is what I thought a person in his position would be.  He's an alienated hacker, not some superman dudebro.  Another criticism levelled at this game is the car handing.  Again, I had no problems with this.  I play the driving sections with an XBOX 360 controller which does make a difference as it gives you analog control but I could quite happily throw the many cars round the city taking advantage of understeer and oversteer once I'd got a feel for a particular vehicles characteristics.  It was slightly disappointing not to be able to shoot from a vehicle in single-player mode but the decision was obviously taken to encourage you to take enemies out using your hacking skills.  Which brings me to the hacking itself.  I’ve seen a number of people criticising the “one button hacking” approach.  I don’t get this at all.  In a fraught firefight do they want to have to enter some sort of intricate button combo to trigger hacking events?  Personally I think the single button approach works well; it does not interrupt the flow of the game which is really important.  The story missions were all fun and compelling, far more than the Grand Theft Auto staple of drive a person from point A to B.\n\nBut my longest lasting memory of this game will be the 1v1 online intrusions.  The panic which sets in when you notice you're being hacked and your subsequent desperation to find the hackers location with the time limit ticking away.  Or the adrenaline surge of being the hacker and trying to blend in with the crowd, to act like an NPC and hope you won't be profiled.  To find that perfect hiding spot, or to constantly shift positions hoping not to be spotted in a tense game of hide and seek with the search area decreasing in size as the hack continues.  I've come away from these encounters shaking with tension.  They're unlike anything I've experienced in a long time in online gaming because they're personal.  It’s not dying in a hail of semi aimed bullets in Battlefield 4 and waiting to re-spawn.  It’s not even getting your head kicked in in one-on-one Street Fighter 4.  It’s unique, it’s intimate, it’s not wanting to be found because you're almost helpless in these situations.  You can't just shoot your way out.  All you can do if found is run.  And that is totally absorbing and totally brilliant!","July 1, 2014","true","61.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I find the single player in this game to be lots of fun. However, the multiplayer is absolutely atrocious. I've not seen many worse multiplayer mechanics in a game before. The host of a server that you invade always has increased health. This is most likely because you are not supposed to kill them. Only tail them or hack them. If you are found you have to escape. But, why escape if you should just be able to kill them? They have increased health almost to the point of almost immortality. Another thing I would like to note. Is the mouse controls and mechanics in this game. Acceleration is forced and so is aim assist. Granted, you can turn down aim assist to minimal, but it still helps too much. Aim assist actually makes my aim worse because it slows down my reticle when I'm moving it towards targets. Overall the singleplayer is fun and I enjoy it. So I do reccomend the game. Multiplayer I could do without though.","May 30, 2014","true","62.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Not the last part so much. Hes a boring guy with a boring name who drowns his sorrows in boring and boring. So he hunts down the people who killed his neice and really the only cool part of the story, the only part that really drove me from mission to mission. WAS THAT SICK ASAIN GUY. Seriosuly his voice acting was amazing and awesome, the writing for his character should have been less intertaining than the story, but it wasnt. So after playing the game for 5 hours i dont feel like "i control the city" it feels like i can change traffic lights and ♥♥♥♥ over people trying to go across a birdge. The combat is standard cover based third person game and the open world is just a modern reskin of assassins creed. Go to a tower and hack it then you get to do stuff. The multiplayer open world is blan and pointless even with freinds and all the other muliplayer functions are really boring. The cyber drugs you take through your ears are only fun for fifteen minutes. The perk tree can be nerly completed in four hours, speaking of which the driving part of the tree was pointless. Theres other parts of the game that are boring and generic to ubisoft games but if you've never played ubisoft games then eight out of ten. If you have then dont bother playing this its not worth your money, get a proper investment like hookers or something.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThommieKun/recommended/243470/","ThommieKun","T-Wess ♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThommieKun/","305 products in account","First of all this game is not a "Steam Game" its on Ubiplay aka Ubishit, which is one reason NOT to buy this game.\n\nThe day this game was released, everyone who bought this game through Ubiplay had problems downloading the game and people who already had (through Steam) couldn't run the game on Online mode, so all we could do was play the Singleplayer Campaign, which sucks.\n\nThe problem went on for days and meanwhile I got to play the entire campaign, do almost every single side mission and test the game to its fullest.\n\nFirst of all I want to point out how horrible the Level Design and AI is. The City feels so dull and empty and is really badly designed. The map is confusing to use (I did start to get the hang of it after a while) and you keep meeting the same people on the streets again and again. Look closely at that construction worker or that business woman, because you will most likely see that person again hundreds of times while playing the game (if you even manage to get yourself to play this game for a long period of time).\n\nDriving looked really cool in trailers and gameplays released when this game was first announced, but then they managed to screw it up just before release. Driving just feels clumsy and you end up in many awkward positions and while hitting a single light post can cause your car to explode, having the cops shoot at your car, while ramming it during a hunt for 10 minutes might not even cause a scratch.\n\nCops are really easy to avoid if you have a couple of Jam Comms which you spam while they scan for the "suspect" which is YOU. So you can go around and gun down 50 people, have one of them call the cops, but they wont chase you or arrive at the scene before they find you with the ctOS scan, which you can disable by spamming the Jam Comms Ability a couple of times while slowly driving away from the scene.\n\nOne of the things I was really excited over was the Campaign, but it turned out to be pretty ♥♥♥♥ and the only thing that was fun to watch were some of the cut-scenes. Everything was predictable and some of the missions were pretty irritating and some were too easy and could be done in 5-10 minutes.\n\nHacking is not realistic at ALL.\n\nWhen Multiplayer finally seemed to start working, I couldn't wait to see what this game had to offer for real, but the servers are ♥♥♥♥, whereas people disconnect in the middle of a Multiplayer match, leaving you with nothing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. You don't get cash, EXP or anything if someone disconnects in the middle of a duel or multiplayer match which is absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Servers are probably the ones to blame and I just cant seem to play Online.\n\nThis is the LAST Ubisoft game I ever buy. I am not buying another game from you guys before you start publishing games on Steam and its on Sale. DO NOT buy this game for 60€! Its just not worth it.","August 11, 2014","false","25.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilverChaospwn/recommended/243470/","SilverChaospwn","SilverChaos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilverChaospwn/","183 products in account","TL;DR  Go to Pros/Cons, and Overall/Ratings list section.\n\nSo, let's talk about  PC Performances. It feels like Ubisoft PC Tester didn't test out other computers just to see if the performances are going smooth, but too lazy and just keep it the way it is. Having to drive around (sometimes), some hometown places, and crowdy area can be issues with FPS dropped around 20-45 FPS. Unfortunately, there are no mod files added to reduce FPS and good performances since I tried it out and it didn't work.\n\nFor the 3rd Party DRM, aka Uplay, it is indeed requires you to use as Uplay Account in order to redeemed the game through Steam CD Keys. There are chances that it can messes you up for CD Keys like "Season Pass" that was already in used by someone else. So, I have to sent the ticket to Steam and Uplay Support at the same time. Steam Support told me Uplay was the responsible for CD Keys because Ubisoft developed it. I blame Steam for CD keys having to be at the same code for someone else. Since I've sent some screenshot attachments to Uplay Support for Proof of Purchases, it took me about 5 days to get a new code for "Season Pass" and it does actually work. So, it's pretty lame that you required to use it to launch 3rd Party DRM when you're about to play this through Steam.\n\nThe storyline can be a bit of lacking problem. Spoiler Alert: What happens is that each storyline can be bit of jumping plot that Aiden has so much things to do. Interrogating the hitman by the club, Jordi got a contract for him, work under as Damien (the Antagonist), info and assassinate Mr. Iraq, someone (not the player) hacked you, save his sister, check whose behind all of this, assassinate "Lucky" Quinn because he's greedy bas-tard that does favour for someone's contract, finish Damien once and for all. I give it 6.5/10 for this storyline.\n\nFor the Gameplay, it almost does kind of reminds me like GTA or Saints Row in Open World and being chased by cops or thugs (with the exception that you cannot ride on helicopter). Hacking was probably one of the fun things to do like explode the steam pipe, neutralized traffic, traps, ambush, stealing someone's money, disable ability, feedback noises, distraction, etc. You can also do crafting equipment like Grenades, IED, Blackout, Lure, etc. The guns has a lot of variety things like AK-47, SCAR-20, Silencer Pistol, Desert Eagle, MP5 Navy, Sniper Rifle, etc, but no RPG. Clothing looks pretty cool though, but only about 7 set of styles. -_- The skill trees does help to improve the advantages through the gameplay. The driving physics can be a problem and weird things because of ramming into someone else cars and steering as well. In-game volume was a issue problem that I couldn't possibly hear it so low to low-moderate and already maxed to 100% in-game, even the speakers or headphones as well (Set 60-70% on desktop). I do not care about graphics nor like E3 style. I have no intentions about the graphics. Just the Gameplay itself.\n\nFor the Missions, it does actually have an optionally to do stealth mode that makes easier to get past through rather than loud that causes to get more trouble and bring reinforcements, but only some of them are limited with it. The Side Mission Contracts can help and lead you to gain more exp., money and reputation level.\n\nThe Multiplayer Online was not really worth it. Especially what happens when the players leave their mics on, they ended up having to be some background noises than in-game, and forgot to turn it off. Here are the lists for each game mode.\nOnline Hacking/Tailing was just useless like "Hide and Seek" style that you have to profile the player who is behind to hack your thing and kill him/her to stop the hacking. Only problem is that player can be a hacker/cheater like on the house roof that you cannot reach him/her to stop. Sometimes, even if you're about to hack coTS Tower to reveal your navigation map, but you get interrupted by the player who is hacking at you and must find him/her, then after that, go back to the stupid thing for such a long way to hack the coTS Tower. (There's an optional that you can turn off the "Online Hacking" under the "Options" menu so it doesn't bother you for being hacked, but loses all your notoriety skills, which is only in "multiplayer" effect).\nDecryption Combat Mode was okay. Play either Lone Wolf or Team Based. Your objective is to grab the encryption file and hold on to it until it reaches 100%. It will affect for the same percentage like 50% if you or your teammates died, the enemy takes it and continues at 50% to decrypt it. Sometimes, having to be some minor issue lag can be a problem because of little hit detection. Don't forget, the performances as well if things going chaos.\nRace mode was also okay. It has some minor issue lag whether you are in the lead or someone else was in the lead and you couldn't possibly tell whose is in 1st place. Don't forget, Car Physics that can cause a problem to run into something.\nOnline Free-Roam was pretty fun to play with your friends to have some blast city, but no missions or contracts which is kind of suck and would've been.Pros:\nOpen World/Huge Map Variety\nStealth Missions (Optional, but limited missions)\nSide Mission Contracts\nWeapons and Clothing Variety\nHacking Variety like someone's phone to steal their money, personal info, crafting, neutralize traffic, explode, etc.\nCool Soundtrack\nCons:\nPoor Optimization/Bad Performances  (My Computer Specs) [silverchaospwn.tumblr.com]\nRequired Uplay account to activate the game and launch 3rd Party DRM.\nIn-Game volume problem\nBit of lacking Story Line\nDriving Physics weird\nOnline Multiplayer was not worth it (e.g. minor lag issue, players left their mic on ended up making background noises, going to hack coTS Tower, but then interrupted and player is hacking at you.)Overall, I give it 7/10 for this game. My only recommendation is that if you like Open World type, interacting to the people in the city, and hacking for fun, then give it try and you'll love it. But, I highly suggest you wait until it goes on sale.\nIf your computer can't run properly or game is broken, even if you purchased it accidentally, request for a refund.","July 9, 2015","true","32.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Game looks nothing like the advertised video's and it runs like garbage. It's playable, but it's got a lot of stuttering issues and problems that are the games poor optimization and not the fault of anyones hardware set ups. I woul drecommend waiting for a few more patches and a discount. I waited a few months myself and it went on sale for the summer sale, and even then the game is still not really in an acceptable state in my opinion. Sleeping Dogs looks better than this game on PC and runs a thousand times better to boot. Watch_Dogs on PC is pretty disappointing, clearly the PC version was an afterthought and a bad port job. If you must play it, pick it up on Xbox One or PS4 instead, the game is clearly optimized for those consoles and not PC.","July 27, 2014","false","2.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Well, I was right to doubt.\n\nAt nothing best it's a different kind of GTA, I sort of wanted to step away from classing it that, but I can't. It has like a karma bar, but that has nothing to do with the story or how people perceive you, it doesn't change anything from what I can tell. It's not like InFamous, where the civilians roaming the street would either cheer you on or be afraid of you and maybe fight back. They all act relatively the same.\n\nBut lets get down to the game, a lot of people may only be interested in the single player, going to be honest I can't really remember what goes on in that game only the huge main points that then finish the story and at best it's okay? It certainly isn't a game I'd play again, because why? Why would you play it again? There's no other decisions, as far as I know there's nothing I missed while playing through.\n\nPlaying the game, boy it feels like a mixed bag, the shooting is much like GTA IV to me, so maybe a tad challenging at time, it's a typical third person duck behind cover shooter, NOTHING MORE. Driving around Chicago, those physics are messed up, if you have a crash on a motorbike the bike will comically hover/fly like ten times more than it should do. Whereas car are just indestructable don't seem to let up when you have scrapes etc, the driving it self is that easy that you shouldn't ever have a shunt either, but that depends if this game runs okay.\n\nThe game runs terribly, there's nothing more than that, the graphics certainly aren't anything special and if they ever used the "next gen" term they should be proceeded to be slapped on the bum until they have an bum like a baboon. There's micro stutters, really bad stutters where it could hang for several seconds, everytime I use a electronic billboard the game would freeze up and crash. Also, when you first play the game you notice that mouse has some really bad mouse acceleration and lag that makes it feel like you are wading through soup.\n\nSo yeah, was it worth it?\n\nNot in the slightest, yes there was plenty of hype for this game, I get that. But I just wish it was at least an "okay" game, and at best it's just on the average, nothing new here!\n\nOh and the multiplayer, didn't get around to it as uPlay is incompetent and should of either been killed off already or at last been improved.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cwm33/recommended/243470/","cwm33","cwm33","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cwm33/","323 products in account","The game does provide for some interesting gameplay mechanics and ideas while borrowing heavily from other titles in other areas.  The hacking components to do things like explode grenades and blow steam pipes are really fun to play with, and using it to mess with guards can be downright hilarious.  The hacking mini-game is a basic puzzle solving thing with the occasional timed component thrown in.  You'll find yourself doing it on more than a few occasions during your game, but if you take your time and mess around with side jobs it doesn't get too obnoxious.  It does rely on the "camera hopping" mechanic a fair bit for some areas and that can get pretty old as well.\n\nPretty large selection of guns are available (and a HUGE amount of pistols), but in that entire selection only two of the guns are silenced and they're both in the pistol category.  TWO.  In a game where stealth is a great option for getting to your goals, having only two silenced weapons is pretty irritating.  Multiple options for a sniper rifle, but again, no silencer for any of them.  How many games nowadays let you change out the attachments on your guns?  This one doesn't, stuck with what you've got.\n\nFor vehicles, you're definitely not going to get anything near realistic vehicle handling and an arcadey vehicle model is perfectly servicable but sometimes the controls on the vehicles can be fairly twitchy even with a controller.  Going to play with pure KB/mouse?  Vehicle controls just went from twitchy to derpy.  On the bright side the game is very good at swapping between kb/m and controller inputs and dynamically changes screen prompts accordingly.\n\nAs far as game engine quality goes, the graphics are pretty enough, but they should have spent more time on stability.  The un-patched game crashed on me, a LOT.  When I say a lot, I mean this game was crashing more than pre-release alpha games I've played.  I saw more crashes (and even BSODs) playing this game than a NHSTA crash test dummy during a testing marathon with a severe shortage of crash test dummies.  Unskippable mission briefings can make these crashes EXTREMELY irritating.\n\nRegarding the plot, I found the storyline to be completely sub-par, the characters unremarkable and the plot "motivations" to be wafer thin at best.  The game basically tries to manipulate you to feel something for a certain character via cutscenes and sappy music but it feels so forced and phoned in that it just doesn't work.  Most of the traveling companions you come across I formed zero attachment to apart from Jordi who actually had a decent personality, and  there was even one point in the game which should be a fairly big motivator but it just didn't work at all and felt very "meh" as well.  The primary plot device of doing all this because your niece was murdered is a wafer thin motivator as well.  I know my family isn't super close, but if my niece was murdered I wouldn't go on a vigilante rampage committing wholesale slaughter of countless goons, the occasional police officer and running over scores of pedestrians that were in the wrong place at the wrong time.  If the guy was prototyped as a crime fighter from the get-go then sure that might work to direct wrath, but as it stands it makes zero sense at all unless it's a thinly veiled cover for being a sociopath.\n\nI managed to get 40 hours of "entertainment" (or hours of time occupied?) out of the game, which made the game come out to about $1.50ish per hour of entertainment which is pretty decent by most standards.  Would I do it all over again?  No, most definitely not.","June 23, 2014","false","39.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cwm33/recommended/243470/","cwm33","cwm33","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cwm33/","323 products in account","The game does provide for some interesting gameplay mechanics and ideas while borrowing heavily from other titles in other areas.  The hacking components to do things like explode grenades and blow steam pipes are really fun to play with, and using it to mess with guards can be downright hilarious.  The hacking mini-game is a basic puzzle solving thing with the occasional timed component thrown in.  You'll find yourself doing it on more than a few occasions during your game, but if you take your time and mess around with side jobs it doesn't get too obnoxious.  It does rely on the "camera hopping" mechanic a fair bit for some areas and that can get pretty old as well.\n\nPretty large selection of guns are available (and a HUGE amount of pistols), but in that entire selection only two of the guns are silenced and they're both in the pistol category.  TWO.  In a game where stealth is a great option for getting to your goals, having only two silenced weapons is pretty irritating.  Multiple options for a sniper rifle, but again, no silencer for any of them.  How many games nowadays let you change out the attachments on your guns?  This one doesn't, stuck with what you've got.\n\nFor vehicles, you're definitely not going to get anything near realistic vehicle handling and an arcadey vehicle model is perfectly servicable but sometimes the controls on the vehicles can be fairly twitchy even with a controller.  Going to play with pure KB/mouse?  Vehicle controls just went from twitchy to derpy.  On the bright side the game is very good at swapping between kb/m and controller inputs and dynamically changes screen prompts accordingly.\n\nAs far as game engine quality goes, the graphics are pretty enough, but they should have spent more time on stability.  The un-patched game crashed on me, a LOT.  When I say a lot, I mean this game was crashing more than pre-release alpha games I've played.  I saw more crashes (and even BSODs) playing this game than a NHSTA crash test dummy during a testing marathon with a severe shortage of crash test dummies.  Unskippable mission briefings can make these crashes EXTREMELY irritating.\n\nRegarding the plot, I found the storyline to be completely sub-par, the characters unremarkable and the plot "motivations" to be wafer thin at best.  The game basically tries to manipulate you to feel something for a certain character via cutscenes and sappy music but it feels so forced and phoned in that it just doesn't work.  Most of the traveling companions you come across I formed zero attachment to apart from Jordi who actually had a decent personality, and  there was even one point in the game which should be a fairly big motivator but it just didn't work at all and felt very "meh" as well.  The primary plot device of doing all this because your niece was murdered is a wafer thin motivator as well.  I know my family isn't super close, but if my niece was murdered I wouldn't go on a vigilante rampage committing wholesale slaughter of countless goons, the occasional police officer and running over scores of pedestrians that were in the wrong place at the wrong time.  If the guy was prototyped as a crime fighter from the get-go then sure that might work to direct wrath, but as it stands it makes zero sense at all unless it's a thinly veiled cover for being a sociopath.\n\nI managed to get 40 hours of "entertainment" (or hours of time occupied?) out of the game, which made the game come out to about $1.50ish per hour of entertainment which is pretty decent by most standards.  Would I do it all over again?  No, most definitely not.","June 23, 2014","false","39.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is a shame that the only missions where you get to do so are early in the game.  Soon, guns are required, and control over large spaces is reduced to one's immediate space again, and even then retaining control is difficult and trial-by-error.\nThe final straw for me was a mission in which I had dispatched all enemies, received my reward, and was informed that the mission was over, and only then died to a steam pipe, at which point, the game made me restart the mission from the last checkpoint. In the latter part of the game, the missions become wave-based for no good reason. Clearing areas multiple times are rote, copy/paste experiences that bring nothing new to the table, except to waste the player's time.

Well, I was right to doubt.\n\nAt nothing best it's a different kind of GTA, I sort of wanted to step away from classing it that, but I can't. It has like a karma bar, but that has nothing to do with the story or how people perceive you, it doesn't change anything from what I can tell. It's not like InFamous, where the civilians roaming the street would either cheer you on or be afraid of you and maybe fight back. They all act relatively the same.\n\nBut lets get down to the game, a lot of people may only be interested in the single player, going to be honest I can't really remember what goes on in that game only the huge main points that then finish the story and at best it's okay? It certainly isn't a game I'd play again, because why? Why would you play it again? There's no other decisions, as far as I know there's nothing I missed while playing through.\n\nPlaying the game, boy it feels like a mixed bag, the shooting is much like GTA IV to me, so maybe a tad challenging at time, it's a typical third person duck behind cover shooter, NOTHING MORE. Driving around Chicago, those physics are messed up, if you have a crash on a motorbike the bike will comically hover/fly like ten times more than it should do. Whereas car are just indestructable don't seem to let up when you have scrapes etc, the driving it self is that easy that you shouldn't ever have a shunt either, but that depends if this game runs okay.\n\nThe game runs terribly, there's nothing more than that, the graphics certainly aren't anything special and if they ever used the "next gen" term they should be proceeded to be slapped on the bum until they have an bum like a baboon. There's micro stutters, really bad stutters where it could hang for several seconds, everytime I use a electronic billboard the game would freeze up and crash. Also, when you first play the game you notice that mouse has some really bad mouse acceleration and lag that makes it feel like you are wading through soup.\n\nSo yeah, was it worth it?\n\nNot in the slightest, yes there was plenty of hype for this game, I get that. But I just wish it was at least an "okay" game, and at best it's just on the average, nothing new here!\n\nOh and the multiplayer, didn't get around to it as uPlay is incompetent and should of either been killed off already or at last been improved.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/avadyskrasia/recommended/243470/","avadyskrasia","Ava","http://steamcommunity.com/id/avadyskrasia/","337 products in account","Wach_Dogs. There aren't many gamers who haven't heard about this game. Though most has been negative. True, this game didn't turn out the way they promised everyone. But its still a fun game to play. There are many good things, but also plenty of bad things.\n\nGood things are: The way the game looks. It looks beautiful. The city feels really alive, unlike many open world games, the first time I was running through the alleys to dodge the cops, or just taking a stroll over the sidewalk I was blown away. Plans move in the wind, people all seem to have their own lives, the traffic was plenty. Also the story, even if it is a little slow paced is interesting enough.\n\nBut.. Like in Assassins Creed, once you walk around the world of Watch_Dogs long enough, you start to see what the game really is. Nothing but an Assassins Creed in modern times. You still have to do side quests, get to view points, trail people. Sure, the stopping cime things are fun at first, but after a while they just get plain annoying. There are only a few versions. Either stop a man from setting something on fire, killing someone, mugging someone or robbing a store. Perhaps a few more, but its always the same. Wait for the victim/criminal to show up, stay out of sight and ONLY act when the game feels you can. Fun to them to early, even though its pretty obvious what is going to happen, and both criminal and victim just walk away like nothing happened, and you get nothing for your troubles, even though technically you still stopped a crime just by showing up. You can spy on people through the routers and take a look into their personal lives, and that really made me thing they left those parts into the hands of 12 year olds. Its to often someone jacking off, people having sex, watching porn or even a girl that commits suicide. WHY THE HELL PUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN A GAME!? THAT IS NOT FUN! You even get to see some guy chopping a human hand to bits and walking away with cocktail sauce. I don't know if that was supposed to be a reference to Hannibal Lecter, or just something plain creepy.\n\nStealth works fine in this game. You can almost go into every situations stealth like. But the game breaks down at some points that makes you feel like your effort to stay hidden, out of sight and saving lives by taking them all down non lethal is just wortless. You are stealthy, you get into a camp, you take down certain enemies, or you can just sneak by without getting seen. You finish you mission, and suddenly they all know where you are? Or you take everyone down non lethal, you finsh the mission, and the story is just going "I killed them all. What am I doing?" NO YOU DIDN'T!!! I SPENT HOURS NOT TO KILL SOMEONE!\n\nDriving is really bad in this game, and that is just something unforgivable in a open world game where you have to drive 80% of the time. And it hasn't got to do much with the driving mechanics, but with the fact that the controls have a 0,5 second lag. You steer right, 0,5 seconds later it starts to steer, and before its to late, you see you steered to far so you steer left, 0,5 seconds later it does, but not before it hits the cardbox made lightpost that breaks into 3 pieces with the smallest tap.\n\nThen there are the missions. It starts out fine, even though Aiden is the most boring protagonist ever, but later in the game it gets to boring, like a series you follow where it takes 10 episodes to reach something they should have done in 1 episode. It takes to long, and the missions start to be a drag, and its to much the same. Infiltrate the base here, don't get seen or kill them all, complete objective, escape back up that magically arrives. Oh, they do vary it sometimes with a chase with the bad driving mechanics that made me scream most of the times. And the fun thing? Everytime you fail a mission and have to start over, you see the same 5 to 10 second cutscene of the guy escaping, or the map showing where to go, or the backup arriving, and you can't skip that. One point, back up was arriving, and you only see a couple of cars drive onto the area where you are. In those 5 seconds, I could have equiped my favorite gun, I could have found a good vantage point, I could have threw some remote explosives as a trap, but no, you have to wait till that same cutscene is done.\n\nI know, I know, why do I recommend this game? Because if you get through those frustrations, its still a good shooter, one of the best looking ones. The hacking is fun, the feel of control is fun, the on foot escaping from the cops/gangsters is fun and intense, and the stealth is also quite intense, even though the game occasionally takes a big dump on your stealthy efforts. Ubisoft made a lot of promises with this game, the way it looked in the E3 2012 and what you could do. But its really a standard game in a nice wrapping. The city looks amazing, alive and full. The animations look beautiful, the water is one of the best looking water I have seen in a game so far and the story feels interesting. It's just a shame that later the game turns into a more standard shooter, as they suddenly thow in enemies you can't knock out, but have to shoot 100 times before they go down due to to much bodyarmor. You have to blow them up twice. Those sorts of enemies, along with Deus Ex Machima reasons for enemies to suddenly know where you are break the stealth and with that, the game, especially when it forces its own story on you while you clearly did NOT do what the story tells you you've done (The stealth non-lethal takedowns and the game telling you you killed them all).\n\nThe game is not perfect, but not many games are. Watch_Dogs 2 (which will come) needs to improve on some things, but not much. Character creation (and for Gods sake, Ubisoft... Make a cool female character for once that doesn't always show off their ♥♥♥♥.... One female protagonist that helps you, and they stole it right out of The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo and gave her a shirt that barely covers her breasts), better controls without the lag, the game following player choises better and less filler missions.\n\nI give this game a 6/10, which is average. I would have given it a 5, but they gained one point because it looks so amazing, and the hacking, following people through the camera's, or taking out whole groups through camera's by blowing stuff up from a distance is pretty fun for a while. And per info, I rate games normally. 1 is very bad, 3 is just not good enough, 5 is average, 7 is good, 9 is very good and 10 is perfect.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Yes, because it is still a fun, action packed game.\n\nOh, I haven't went much into the online part of the game because it feels unfinished. You can choose several game modes, but I haven't tried them all yet. I tried hacking, in which you show up in another players game, you have to hack and stay hidden till the hack is complete. Its a fun cat and mouse game. The other I tried is tailing where you have to follow another player for a while without him or her noticing. What I dislike about it, is that you always look like Aiden and the other player looks like a normal pedestrian. I think it would be more fun if you could make your own online avatar that you can play when doing online missions. Mainly because Aiden is just so uninteresting. =)","July 2, 2014","true","40.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Personally I thought the control and playstyle was similar to Deus Ex: Human Revolution, which is one of my favorite games of all time. I'm not a fan of the pre-order/DLC fiasco, but all of that aside.. doesn't really make a difference about gameplay elements at all really. Being a 1920's Mobster is pretty BA though. All in all.. regardless of the negativity associated with the game, it is definitely fun, and you'll get at least 20 hours out of it if you just do the single player.","June 30, 2014","true","47.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I find the single player in this game to be lots of fun. However, the multiplayer is absolutely atrocious. I've not seen many worse multiplayer mechanics in a game before. The host of a server that you invade always has increased health. This is most likely because you are not supposed to kill them. Only tail them or hack them. If you are found you have to escape. But, why escape if you should just be able to kill them? They have increased health almost to the point of almost immortality. Another thing I would like to note. Is the mouse controls and mechanics in this game. Acceleration is forced and so is aim assist. Granted, you can turn down aim assist to minimal, but it still helps too much. Aim assist actually makes my aim worse because it slows down my reticle when I'm moving it towards targets. Overall the singleplayer is fun and I enjoy it. So I do reccomend the game. Multiplayer I could do without though.","May 30, 2014","true","62.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/recommended/243470/","badwhippet","Moonwind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/","568 products in account","Watch_dogs is a HUGE game: huge open-world map, huge number of missions and a long length of game.  The story campaign is varied and interesting, and the characters are very well developed (though perhaps a little under-used).  The game has a colossal number of side missions but most of these tend to become a bit repetitive after a while (fortunately, they're optional).  The AI enemies are intelligent enough to flank you (they don't 'reset to patrol' after a given time unlike other games).  You'll often have the choice to play by stealth or confrontation.\n\nAs for visual quality, there have been a lot of comparisons between the game and its promotional video at E3.  Don't be fooled though; just because it's not as detailed, it still has a fantastic level of quality.  The control options are excellent too: Ubisoft has coded the game to detect whatever you're using and switch to it immediately, so you can (if you wish) use the mouse to aim and shoot, and gamepad for driving.  The best of both worlds.  If only other games did this.\n\nThere are various problems with the game: poor performance dogs high-end nvidia cards (780Ti, Titan etc), it doesn't like SLI/Crossfire and the DLC often doesn't materialise.   Frustrations aside, it is still a quality game, but do ensure you meet the requirements as it's a very demanding game too.","July 1, 2014","true","311.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilverChaospwn/recommended/243470/","SilverChaospwn","SilverChaos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilverChaospwn/","183 products in account","TL;DR  Go to Pros/Cons, and Overall/Ratings list section.\n\nSo, let's talk about  PC Performances. It feels like Ubisoft PC Tester didn't test out other computers just to see if the performances are going smooth, but too lazy and just keep it the way it is. Having to drive around (sometimes), some hometown places, and crowdy area can be issues with FPS dropped around 20-45 FPS. Unfortunately, there are no mod files added to reduce FPS and good performances since I tried it out and it didn't work.\n\nFor the 3rd Party DRM, aka Uplay, it is indeed requires you to use as Uplay Account in order to redeemed the game through Steam CD Keys. There are chances that it can messes you up for CD Keys like "Season Pass" that was already in used by someone else. So, I have to sent the ticket to Steam and Uplay Support at the same time. Steam Support told me Uplay was the responsible for CD Keys because Ubisoft developed it. I blame Steam for CD keys having to be at the same code for someone else. Since I've sent some screenshot attachments to Uplay Support for Proof of Purchases, it took me about 5 days to get a new code for "Season Pass" and it does actually work. So, it's pretty lame that you required to use it to launch 3rd Party DRM when you're about to play this through Steam.\n\nThe storyline can be a bit of lacking problem. Spoiler Alert: What happens is that each storyline can be bit of jumping plot that Aiden has so much things to do. Interrogating the hitman by the club, Jordi got a contract for him, work under as Damien (the Antagonist), info and assassinate Mr. Iraq, someone (not the player) hacked you, save his sister, check whose behind all of this, assassinate "Lucky" Quinn because he's greedy bas-tard that does favour for someone's contract, finish Damien once and for all. I give it 6.5/10 for this storyline.\n\nFor the Gameplay, it almost does kind of reminds me like GTA or Saints Row in Open World and being chased by cops or thugs (with the exception that you cannot ride on helicopter). Hacking was probably one of the fun things to do like explode the steam pipe, neutralized traffic, traps, ambush, stealing someone's money, disable ability, feedback noises, distraction, etc. You can also do crafting equipment like Grenades, IED, Blackout, Lure, etc. The guns has a lot of variety things like AK-47, SCAR-20, Silencer Pistol, Desert Eagle, MP5 Navy, Sniper Rifle, etc, but no RPG. Clothing looks pretty cool though, but only about 7 set of styles. -_- The skill trees does help to improve the advantages through the gameplay. The driving physics can be a problem and weird things because of ramming into someone else cars and steering as well. In-game volume was a issue problem that I couldn't possibly hear it so low to low-moderate and already maxed to 100% in-game, even the speakers or headphones as well (Set 60-70% on desktop). I do not care about graphics nor like E3 style. I have no intentions about the graphics. Just the Gameplay itself.\n\nFor the Missions, it does actually have an optionally to do stealth mode that makes easier to get past through rather than loud that causes to get more trouble and bring reinforcements, but only some of them are limited with it. The Side Mission Contracts can help and lead you to gain more exp., money and reputation level.\n\nThe Multiplayer Online was not really worth it. Especially what happens when the players leave their mics on, they ended up having to be some background noises than in-game, and forgot to turn it off. Here are the lists for each game mode.\nOnline Hacking/Tailing was just useless like "Hide and Seek" style that you have to profile the player who is behind to hack your thing and kill him/her to stop the hacking. Only problem is that player can be a hacker/cheater like on the house roof that you cannot reach him/her to stop. Sometimes, even if you're about to hack coTS Tower to reveal your navigation map, but you get interrupted by the player who is hacking at you and must find him/her, then after that, go back to the stupid thing for such a long way to hack the coTS Tower. (There's an optional that you can turn off the "Online Hacking" under the "Options" menu so it doesn't bother you for being hacked, but loses all your notoriety skills, which is only in "multiplayer" effect).\nDecryption Combat Mode was okay. Play either Lone Wolf or Team Based. Your objective is to grab the encryption file and hold on to it until it reaches 100%. It will affect for the same percentage like 50% if you or your teammates died, the enemy takes it and continues at 50% to decrypt it. Sometimes, having to be some minor issue lag can be a problem because of little hit detection. Don't forget, the performances as well if things going chaos.\nRace mode was also okay. It has some minor issue lag whether you are in the lead or someone else was in the lead and you couldn't possibly tell whose is in 1st place. Don't forget, Car Physics that can cause a problem to run into something.\nOnline Free-Roam was pretty fun to play with your friends to have some blast city, but no missions or contracts which is kind of suck and would've been.Pros:\nOpen World/Huge Map Variety\nStealth Missions (Optional, but limited missions)\nSide Mission Contracts\nWeapons and Clothing Variety\nHacking Variety like someone's phone to steal their money, personal info, crafting, neutralize traffic, explode, etc.\nCool Soundtrack\nCons:\nPoor Optimization/Bad Performances  (My Computer Specs) [silverchaospwn.tumblr.com]\nRequired Uplay account to activate the game and launch 3rd Party DRM.\nIn-Game volume problem\nBit of lacking Story Line\nDriving Physics weird\nOnline Multiplayer was not worth it (e.g. minor lag issue, players left their mic on ended up making background noises, going to hack coTS Tower, but then interrupted and player is hacking at you.)Overall, I give it 7/10 for this game. My only recommendation is that if you like Open World type, interacting to the people in the city, and hacking for fun, then give it try and you'll love it. But, I highly suggest you wait until it goes on sale.\nIf your computer can't run properly or game is broken, even if you purchased it accidentally, request for a refund.","July 9, 2015","true","32.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sure, with all the people "invading" your game and other stuff stopping you from doing the main story, the story becomes quite longer than it actually is.\nThe reason i finished the game in 30 hours is because i didn't really do the main missions as fast as you could have, i went after alot of other stuff, but the thing is, there are only about 50 missions in the entire game and almost all of the missions are the same things. If i were to split the missions into different groups depending on what they were about and what you did in them, there would be about 5-8 categories.\nI do recommend this game cause it's alot of fun to play, however, if you're buying it mainly for a good, long story game, i would not buy it.\n\n(Oh yeah, and also, no co-op?

(irony bar full\n\n\nDon't buy this game 'till they fix it. oh and, the menu screen is supposed to be glitchy. just a heads-up.\n\nRecommendation as post time: Nope.wmv\nRecommendation when fixed: SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!\n\n\nEDIT: Ubisoft has announced that they are working on a fix!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThommieKun/recommended/243470/","ThommieKun","T-Wess ♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThommieKun/","305 products in account","First of all this game is not a "Steam Game" its on Ubiplay aka Ubishit, which is one reason NOT to buy this game.\n\nThe day this game was released, everyone who bought this game through Ubiplay had problems downloading the game and people who already had (through Steam) couldn't run the game on Online mode, so all we could do was play the Singleplayer Campaign, which sucks.\n\nThe problem went on for days and meanwhile I got to play the entire campaign, do almost every single side mission and test the game to its fullest.\n\nFirst of all I want to point out how horrible the Level Design and AI is. The City feels so dull and empty and is really badly designed. The map is confusing to use (I did start to get the hang of it after a while) and you keep meeting the same people on the streets again and again. Look closely at that construction worker or that business woman, because you will most likely see that person again hundreds of times while playing the game (if you even manage to get yourself to play this game for a long period of time).\n\nDriving looked really cool in trailers and gameplays released when this game was first announced, but then they managed to screw it up just before release. Driving just feels clumsy and you end up in many awkward positions and while hitting a single light post can cause your car to explode, having the cops shoot at your car, while ramming it during a hunt for 10 minutes might not even cause a scratch.\n\nCops are really easy to avoid if you have a couple of Jam Comms which you spam while they scan for the "suspect" which is YOU. So you can go around and gun down 50 people, have one of them call the cops, but they wont chase you or arrive at the scene before they find you with the ctOS scan, which you can disable by spamming the Jam Comms Ability a couple of times while slowly driving away from the scene.\n\nOne of the things I was really excited over was the Campaign, but it turned out to be pretty ♥♥♥♥ and the only thing that was fun to watch were some of the cut-scenes. Everything was predictable and some of the missions were pretty irritating and some were too easy and could be done in 5-10 minutes.\n\nHacking is not realistic at ALL.\n\nWhen Multiplayer finally seemed to start working, I couldn't wait to see what this game had to offer for real, but the servers are ♥♥♥♥, whereas people disconnect in the middle of a Multiplayer match, leaving you with nothing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. You don't get cash, EXP or anything if someone disconnects in the middle of a duel or multiplayer match which is absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Servers are probably the ones to blame and I just cant seem to play Online.\n\nThis is the LAST Ubisoft game I ever buy. I am not buying another game from you guys before you start publishing games on Steam and its on Sale. DO NOT buy this game for 60€! Its just not worth it.","August 11, 2014","false","25.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

On my time with the game I have barely touched the story, I've only played 5 story missions. I'm taking my time with the game and really enjoying it. Sure there is bad stuff, sometimes the parkour may feel a little stiff, the driving mechanics may take a while to get used and sometimes the servers don't work properly. But, and this is a big BUT, there is a lot of fun to be had making cash run challenges, downloading them, hacking other players games (which is done superbly when the servers work), doing side quests, listening to music, going to the beach and finding a 59 year old woman who used to be a porn star and now is a plumber, chasing down criminals, infiltrating gang controled areas, hacking people and getting their money, there is just so much fun to be had if you give it a chance, and I haven't even started any of the four digital trips! Also the game does a great job of giving you the player options, I failed once a convoy (which are also quite fun) and when I replayed it I had a completely different experience, the sheer amount of aproaches you have in the game make for a fun experience where you feel like you are in control, most of the things you can think of doing, you generally can. Furthermore the city feels alive, if you walk around you'll find NPCs doing lots of stuff, playing basketball, football, with a drone, NVZN, etc.. it just feels like a city, plus every NPC has a profile which leads to a certain personification that's quite unique to the game. If the game catches your eye and you are curious about it, give it a go.

You know Splinter Cell and Assassin's Creed, those other two critically acclaimed AAA franchises UbiSoft produces?  You know how great the mechanics from those two games would work in a day-after-tomorrow open-world shooter?\n\nWell, Watch_Dogs doesn't have any of that.\n\nThis game could have been a GTA killer, with the engines in UbiSoft's stable.

And then basicaly, I opened steam 2 days before release and went "whatever, I'll preorder that". Yes, I went through that "Missing executable" stuff and redownloading the whole game. Yes, Ubi servers were down, I was just lucky to have an account already. Yes, UPlay swallows. Let's all just accept this and UNTIL it will be good - say nothing about it. Yes, the graphics and stuff are not AS GOOD as they were told. But...\n\nGraphics: graphics are good. Really. Not EPIC, but good. System requirements are SLIGHTLY higher then they should be. Optimisation is worse than it could be. But though - moments when sun blinds you during intence action, rain drops go slow in concentration mode, light flickering and CHANGING in the windows of the city... Are worth it.\n\nSound: great. Great songs, great SFX, nothing to say against.\n\nGameplay: Let's be honest. The game is good. Personaly I had a unique experience ENJOYING long slow walks on foot through the city. The suspence, the overall atmosphere of the city is WAY deeper than any of GTA or whatever. Road accidents, dialogues between peeps on the street, some silly situations, peoples' reaction to player are MUCH more interesting, fun and intence than again, GTA V for example. Yes, AI is dumb as hell. But again, let's be honest, pedestrians will never stop jumping under your car, huh? :)\n\nMost people compare this game to GTA, so I will provide an example as well:\nIn GTA you are a bad person. Whatever you say - you are not vigilante, you are a criminal. Russian hitman, black gangsta, old bank robber or a maniac nutwagon - they are all BAD people. They murder people, take their money, cars, and the only thing they get for it is another fuzz pursuit, they evaded it - they are cool.\nThis game provides you freedom of choise though as far as I can tell - this choice doesn't take effect on the storyline, it's just.. your place in the world, your way of doing things. You can murder random people, steal cars, kill cops left and right, and you WILL feel the concequences. People will know you. In the way you play. If you help people, if you avoid hurting them, then some time killing a criminal you will hear from random pedestrian the following or alike: "Hey, that's you! You're doing the right thing so I won't call the cops, but someone can, so you better hurry!" And those words are priceless.\n\nGame story: I just prevented a crime, followed the criminal for few blocks and finaly exhausted just shot the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

Even though the extra's were a bit much, the main story was very enjoyable to play in and some of the comedy in spying on others can really show if you look into the camera's or personal life's. Its basically a satire of todays technology and how bad it can get if we allow one system to control everything.\n\nThe only problem I did not like was how long it would take to complete some tasks, I am fine with a few collectables, but I think they should tone it down a bit with that. Its the same for the assassin creed series and I hope they tone it down in future titles. Plus the multiplayer component was a bit off for my tastes, it can be fun when all of a sudden your bieng attack by a hacker during a single player game, but when your about to play a mission and then some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gets in the way, then it gets very annoying.\n\nLastly the graphics was greatly blocked due to the coding in the game, good news was I was able to get those features back and in better optimization thanks to a few mods. So the game looked very great at its best.\n\nOverall its great, just the extra's need a bit of tweaking that all, and maybe next time please offer what you advertise.","December 15, 2014","true","62.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I really enjoy the dark setting in this "trip" and it's heavy emphasis on Stealth).\nBTW, the dev's did a good job on the Stealth-Mechanics, while not forcing you to stealth (for the gamers who like a nice old fashioned Shoot-out).\n\nWell, the Hacking feature is nice to toy around with it, especially if you want to listen to private phonecalls (Spunk in the drainage-System, sexual preferences, etc.) I find it quite entertaining to acquire information about the dirty little secrets of the people :D\nHacking is also helpful if you're trying to escape from the Police, if you can manage to activate street blockers or cause accidents after messing around with the traffic light. But to be honest, it can be quite tricky to make use of the Hacks while trying to keep the car on the street (BUT you do have a focus-feature, which allows you to slow down the time, if you wish to use that). Well, at my first few attempts to escape from the police, I had some trouble, because they're quite agressive.\nTo escape you first have to break the line of sight and hope that they'll enter the search phase. While they're searching for you, you have to hide (preferably in a back alley and using the "hide in car"-feature) or you have to leave the searching-zone without being detected.\n\nA word of advise: If you want to play the game fluidly, you should make sure, that you have a good rig.\nI play this game fine on 1920x1080 with "High"-Settings (a few ultra-settings, chosen by the game) with:\n-4x 3.5Ghz (i2700k)\n-16GB RAM (1333Mhz) (8 should suffice, though)\n-Geforce GTX 780Ti  (3GB VRAM, if you plan to play on ULTRA you should have 4GB or more).\n[Geforce Driver: 337.88]\n\nOne last thing:\nYou'll need a "Uplay"-Account to play this game (as well to use the online-modes)","May 28, 2014","true","12.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

As for me, i'm running on Intel and Nvidia stuff, and I haven't had too many problems, I couldn't care less for Uplay, it's never had any problems for me (not counting the day the servers crashed) you don't need Uplay to play the game people.\n\nAside from that little rant, i enjoyed the gameplay, it retained (somewhat) of the whole stealthy/nonstealthy aspect of far cry 3 for certain missions, the lack of the ability to customize guns with attachments sort of sucks (there are very few silenced weapons). The controls are not helpful in many situations, considering citizens call the police if you have your gun out and shift + tab is the steam overlay shortcut, it gets in the way (i can't think of any other good remap, and i can't take a controller everywhere i go) Other than that, the gunplay is good, i played the vigilante (good) side of the reputation, so the gun play was good, i just wish there was more of it.\n\nThere are an over-abundance of "chase" or "take-down" missions throughout the game, and they can be annoying in a sense, take GTA, you can fire a gun in a vehicle there, in Watch_Dogs? no, course not, that would make things less annoying, you have to resort to the games pathing and hope you don't miss your opportunity to take out the enemy via traffic lights, steam pipes, or blockers (the latter of which you will use maybe once or twice)\n\nI enjoy the way police react to you, the whole reputation system, etcetera etcetera, makes you think twice before shooting an officer or a civilian, and ripping a persons phone out of their hands, or pointing a gun at them, or almost running them over is amusing, for a while.\n\nI found minimal glitches in the game, theres the odd occassional one, but nothing that would break the game.\n\nMultiplayer can be fun, and it can leave you quite fed up, i got hacked once, the guy had a vehicle and was playing it well, the second time the guy hid behind something for the entire session, not exactly fair, then i proceeded to hack someone to get my notoriety up, and he quit the game immediately, and at other times i simply wrecked people in decryption.\n\nI enjoyed this, i'd give it a 7.8/10","June 2, 2014","true","51.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And then basicaly, I opened steam 2 days before release and went "whatever, I'll preorder that". Yes, I went through that "Missing executable" stuff and redownloading the whole game. Yes, Ubi servers were down, I was just lucky to have an account already. Yes, UPlay swallows. Let's all just accept this and UNTIL it will be good - say nothing about it. Yes, the graphics and stuff are not AS GOOD as they were told. But...\n\nGraphics: graphics are good. Really. Not EPIC, but good. System requirements are SLIGHTLY higher then they should be. Optimisation is worse than it could be. But though - moments when sun blinds you during intence action, rain drops go slow in concentration mode, light flickering and CHANGING in the windows of the city... Are worth it.\n\nSound: great. Great songs, great SFX, nothing to say against.\n\nGameplay: Let's be honest. The game is good. Personaly I had a unique experience ENJOYING long slow walks on foot through the city. The suspence, the overall atmosphere of the city is WAY deeper than any of GTA or whatever. Road accidents, dialogues between peeps on the street, some silly situations, peoples' reaction to player are MUCH more interesting, fun and intence than again, GTA V for example. Yes, AI is dumb as hell. But again, let's be honest, pedestrians will never stop jumping under your car, huh? :)\n\nMost people compare this game to GTA, so I will provide an example as well:\nIn GTA you are a bad person. Whatever you say - you are not vigilante, you are a criminal. Russian hitman, black gangsta, old bank robber or a maniac nutwagon - they are all BAD people. They murder people, take their money, cars, and the only thing they get for it is another fuzz pursuit, they evaded it - they are cool.\nThis game provides you freedom of choise though as far as I can tell - this choice doesn't take effect on the storyline, it's just.. your place in the world, your way of doing things. You can murder random people, steal cars, kill cops left and right, and you WILL feel the concequences. People will know you. In the way you play. If you help people, if you avoid hurting them, then some time killing a criminal you will hear from random pedestrian the following or alike: "Hey, that's you! You're doing the right thing so I won't call the cops, but someone can, so you better hurry!" And those words are priceless.\n\nGame story: I just prevented a crime, followed the criminal for few blocks and finaly exhausted just shot the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Someone started calling cops - I interrupted the comms and hopped on a random bike while hacking someones account for $5000. And rolling away to the dawn I was thinking, am I really a good person?\n\nThe game may be worse than expected, Ubisoft may f**k up distribution as they always do.\nBut it still is a VERY good game with real, not toy-like living city.

Let me say I really, REALLY wanted to like this game!   Like most others, I was counting down the days until the games release.  Once released, I couldn't play due to Ubisoft's  poor server identification/logon managment.  If I was lucky enough to play, I would fall though the world at random times or jump over an obstacle only to never land on the other side.  Textures will drop out or fade into one another, creating a shoddy impressionistic painting effect.  More often than not, the game would crash due to low memory, I guess 8GB is not enough?  There are so many graphical glitches and charcters disappearing, not to mention, your charachter will down right vanish, in the games current state, It is unplayable; a stutterfest.\n\nI hate to compare a game to another,  but this game remindes me of a stale versions of grand theft auto, where the cities NPC are broken, and with the texture issues, you can watch them change race before your eyes, morphing from black to white and halfway inbetween.\n\nThe save system is Seriously flawed, I'll get the same phone calls from previous missions, randomly thoughout the game.

I pre-ordered the deluxe version (for €69,99) so I was pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when the game finally came out and it just didn't work. It kept crashing, my max FPS was around 11 (with a high-end PC) and the graphics didn't even come close to what Ubisoft showed they would be. Personally I've learned a lesson from this experience, and that lesson is to never ever pre-order a game. This was the first game that I've ever pre-ordered and I'll never do that again. From now on I'll wait on reviews on steam before buying a game. Now, on to the positives and negatives off the game.\n\nNegatives:\n- The graphics weren't all that good\n- The sidemissions (especially the extra ones form the deluxe package) weren't very compelling to do\n- The story sometimes could get a little confusing (but that could also be me)\n\nPositives:\n- I liked the way the hacking worked, I was glad to see Ubisoft didn't make it too hard so you could use it fast\n- The storyline was very interesting\n- The voice acting was pretty good\n\nWhen I was able to look passed the flaws and Ubisoft updated the game to a point where it was playable. I enjoyed Watch_Dogs very much.\nIf you were to ask me if this game is worth anywhere from €50 to €70, I'd definately say no. I myself regret spending so much money on it. I don't say that you shouldn't buy the game. But I'd buy it for a low price (€10 to €20 max).","September 4, 2014","true","29.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

As for me, i'm running on Intel and Nvidia stuff, and I haven't had too many problems, I couldn't care less for Uplay, it's never had any problems for me (not counting the day the servers crashed) you don't need Uplay to play the game people.\n\nAside from that little rant, i enjoyed the gameplay, it retained (somewhat) of the whole stealthy/nonstealthy aspect of far cry 3 for certain missions, the lack of the ability to customize guns with attachments sort of sucks (there are very few silenced weapons). The controls are not helpful in many situations, considering citizens call the police if you have your gun out and shift + tab is the steam overlay shortcut, it gets in the way (i can't think of any other good remap, and i can't take a controller everywhere i go) Other than that, the gunplay is good, i played the vigilante (good) side of the reputation, so the gun play was good, i just wish there was more of it.\n\nThere are an over-abundance of "chase" or "take-down" missions throughout the game, and they can be annoying in a sense, take GTA, you can fire a gun in a vehicle there, in Watch_Dogs? no, course not, that would make things less annoying, you have to resort to the games pathing and hope you don't miss your opportunity to take out the enemy via traffic lights, steam pipes, or blockers (the latter of which you will use maybe once or twice)\n\nI enjoy the way police react to you, the whole reputation system, etcetera etcetera, makes you think twice before shooting an officer or a civilian, and ripping a persons phone out of their hands, or pointing a gun at them, or almost running them over is amusing, for a while.\n\nI found minimal glitches in the game, theres the odd occassional one, but nothing that would break the game.\n\nMultiplayer can be fun, and it can leave you quite fed up, i got hacked once, the guy had a vehicle and was playing it well, the second time the guy hid behind something for the entire session, not exactly fair, then i proceeded to hack someone to get my notoriety up, and he quit the game immediately, and at other times i simply wrecked people in decryption.\n\nI enjoyed this, i'd give it a 7.8/10","June 2, 2014","true","51.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Even though the extra's were a bit much, the main story was very enjoyable to play in and some of the comedy in spying on others can really show if you look into the camera's or personal life's. Its basically a satire of todays technology and how bad it can get if we allow one system to control everything.\n\nThe only problem I did not like was how long it would take to complete some tasks, I am fine with a few collectables, but I think they should tone it down a bit with that. Its the same for the assassin creed series and I hope they tone it down in future titles. Plus the multiplayer component was a bit off for my tastes, it can be fun when all of a sudden your bieng attack by a hacker during a single player game, but when your about to play a mission and then some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gets in the way, then it gets very annoying.\n\nLastly the graphics was greatly blocked due to the coding in the game, good news was I was able to get those features back and in better optimization thanks to a few mods. So the game looked very great at its best.\n\nOverall its great, just the extra's need a bit of tweaking that all, and maybe next time please offer what you advertise.","December 15, 2014","true","62.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

What a mistake that was.\n\nPros:\nFree roam city similar to GTA with plenty of content\nSlow-mo ability for combat and driving similar to Max Payne\nAbsorbing campain that really hits the spot if you are interested in hacking.\nPlenty of random fun moments.\n\nCons:\nGame engine is not as refined as GTA and the campain is shorter. I'm 14 hours in and I feel like the end is getting close.\nNo ability to fly helicopters or planes","April 2","true","15.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","4"

Mission zones and time limits add to the frustration of escaping gangsters that have 5 car loads of bodyguards on call and within a block. NPC cars don't obey the same physics model as the player's car and can't even be hit with a Pitt maneuver successfully no matter the mass difference in the player's favour. They also can't be pushed into tunnel pillars for the same reason. This makes chases that have to take down the target very frustrating because they are immune to the envrionment whilst you are not. However the bad stuff said it does have an engaging play mode of sweeping for cash, upgrading gear, gaining skills that aid your standard mode, and a metric tonne of side-quests and mini-games (some cheesey yet enjoyable). There are homages to Carmageddon, Wonder Boy, and other classics buried within Watch_Dogs. I've read that the "Online Sessions" are the most challenging and will update this review after trying them out enough to get a good handle on that mode.","January 2","true","75.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

That's what Watch_Dogs is.\n\nScripted events, lack of AI intelligence, poor controls on aiming and firing your weapon, and a whole lot more.\n\nAll though Watch_Dogs does have it's minor set backs, I only encountered around three or so faulty problems in the game that would require fixing. This is mostly just how debris manages to fall into cut up chunks when you hit the bottom of the pole, cars you drive act like bull dozers, reputation is too easy to aquire and doesn't punish you enough if you harm others, and the multiplayer is completely lacking in everything all together.\n\nWhat was probably my most enjoyable experience in multiplayer was the Online Hacking gamemode, in which you trail and must hack a random player just like you playing the game. It gives a sense of it truly being an open world along with the excitement when you feel clever and sneaky by avoiding contact with the player you're hacking. Now with Online Hacking out of the way, don't even attempt to play "Free Roam."\n\nNot only is there nothing to do in Free Roam, but there's no side missions, objectives, even minigames to play with your friends such as drinking games or chess to actually spice up the Free Roam side of the game. One problem that really striked me hard with the multiplayer is the lack of connection you have with your friends. You cannot hack them if you wish to, you can't do the Trail Missions against your friends and there's no form of online co-op missions which was a complete disappointment, me being a sneaky sort of person in these games I would have loved to track my friends down and hack them, laughing over Mumble how in the game "I may or may not be right beside them as we speak." The fun is almost non-existant.\n\n\nFor a next-gen platform title the game constantly gets, it's a lie. There's so much more that Watch_Dogs could have been. They took chances and gambled with the Online Hacking gamemode and it was a blast, but I feel as if they should have pushed it even further - add little things to Free Roam that would actually want you to play with friends, fix the car handling and the way you literally plough through cars and objects like they're nothing, play test the damn game for the PC and adjust the way your movement should feel, have it so you can disable mouse acceleration and smoothing in the Options tab and the countless other minor problems. (Yes, you still cannot currently disable mouse acceleration or smoothing in the game. This gives it a non-stop feeling that your playing the game with a console controller.)\n\nAt it's best, Watch_Dogs delievers a gripping and compelling story line with believable characters that have different and unique personalities. During the night, the game shows it beauty with people holding umbrellas, chatting beside a store, or chatting with their group of friends how they "went down on her last night."  Or how each person has their own unique little blurb about themselves and what their income is. All of these make the environment feel believeable and decently life like. It falls flat on the concept in which some missions you would feel like you out-smarted your enemies by sneaking past and knocking out a few guards, but eventually rewarded with a cutscence that shows that you've been spotted some how and you must take out these men that saw you. Or when you knock out everyone because you felt as if your son shouldn't see a bunch of corpses riddled with bullets so you knock them out one by one only for Aiden to say " What were you thinking AIden, you killed all of them and he saw you do it." It doesn't give you any feeling of reward or acknowledgement when you complete a whole mission without being detected and only using your baton besides you "feeling" like you felt sneaky.\n\nIf you're interested in a great single player game with a action packed story-line, this game would be the one. Get it while it's on sale because it's not worth the 60 dollars.\n\nUpdate: I've beaten the game in less than 20 hours around, after you complete the story there's nothing really else to it besides Online Hacking or Trailing. The side missions are incredibly bland and repeitive. I'm also not going to purchase the Spider Robot DLC for a good 10 minutes of gameplay. Besides that, there's no real point for me to reinstall this game.","May 29, 2014","false","24.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

It's pretty fun to exsplore the open world but what really upsets me is that even though it's a great open world the missions are noramly in boring places that are not that interesting.\n\n\nThe missions altohugh fun at times, repeat A LOT, pretty much every mission is, go there, kill them, hack, get out of there, kill bad guys or run. This is just a really boring way to present missions and some mission seems to be thrown in just to make the game longer. It seems like all these missions were created in a day because they all seem to follow the same pattern and don't show any signs of creativity (Apart from the hacking ofcourse)\n\nAs I said about mission just being thrown in there for the hell of it. Somehow the young boy managed to past a bunch of guys with guns and lock himsel in a room undetected. This was never mentioned how he did it, or why (And no, "I was trying to save my mum) is not a vaild reason for why this mission was put into the game. It just makes me feel like the company had no ideas what so ever so they repeated every mission and threw random ones in.\n\n\nThe storyline itsself is just plain boring, this story has been told hundreds of times in games and movies, I really wish the storyline would've atleat let us connect with the characters at first insted of just giving us one segment that features them. I don't know anything about the company who made this game, but I am pretty sure they know you can't connect with a character  after a few minutes of seeing them. If you were atleat going to pull this storyline off I would've like'd to get to know the family more and one thing about the story that is really crazy and weird, how is it ok for him to kill like 1,000 people to save 1 person, I really don't like the morals in the story and I wish another storyline would've been chosen insted .\n\n\n\nThe fact that I can't jump or punch people is really annoying because there was no reason for it not to be in the game other than they are trying to standout so much that they are willing to get rid of populer features in open world to try and be diffrent.\n\n\nNow working the game it'sself, ducking for cover is a constant nightmare and always ends up in me dying, evne when im trying to get into a car, climb a ladder, change cover. There is always some fatal flaw that happens which results in me dying.\n\n\nAgain about the mission, the big mission such as the prison or Iraq's hideout, which looked so big and would surly take a long time to complete, but no, they were comeplted so fast that just makes me feel like I have been lied to about this whole game.\n\n\n\nNow you are maybe wondering why I am being so negitive and giving this game a thumbs up. Well apart from it's many flaws it shows great promise, the open world is fun to exsplore and the online is really fun. I liked this game so please don't get the wrong idea.\n\n\nA thing to work on in the future is character development, what's the point in killing a character that I wasn't able to connect with, and why is the asian character (I forgot his name sorry) not partnering perice?, this may have saved the game.\n\nSorry this review is all over the place and stuff, but I've spent a lot of years studying games and their development  at college and I can see were the rooms for improvments are.\n\n\n\n\nOne final thing top ♥♥♥, there is no custominastion (Sorry for spellign that wrong) It'd be nice to buy some cools shirts, jeans and not just coats, also a garage for cars and maybe being able to buy a house. I'm not sure but I hope there is a sequal to this game.","January 6, 2015","true","54.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It was a bit confusing at first trying to keep up with all the characters involved since there were so many involved. Many folks suggest the storyline is cliché and over used but I found it to be quite immersive and at times, very emotional. I will admit the story seems to be a tad bit short for my taste as completing the game seemed to happen a bit too quickly…and I’m usualy bad about dragging a games story out for a long time before losing interest and never finishing.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Gameplay was spot on although I do wish more of the environment was able to be interacted with. The promise of dynamic movement by “jumping over fences or running through buildings” was cut short by limiting the areas in which these actions could be performed. The options that were given to the player were by all means fun and definitely provided many hours of wreaking havoc but just felt like I was being limited. Once the campaign is completed there seems to be a major lack of replay value as the only choices given to players is to either play solely online contracts or to delete their game and start a new one.\n\nMULTIPLAYER: The transition between offline and online gameplay is near seamless which amazes me to this day. The ability to have another player join your game with NEARLY no warnings is something I’ve personally never experienced in any games I’ve ever played. I know I’m biased due to my lack of variety of games I’ve played, so take that opinion with a grain of salt. Unfortunately there are a few tell tale signs of a player entering your game and once you (or the other player if you’re joining their game) know those signs, it tends to ruin the stealth style of gameplay that was trying to be achieved. The multitude of online game modes is enjoyable but can get old rather quickly. Free Roam seems to be a clusterf*ck of killing only, with no real point other than to just kill other players with no rewards or penalties. Online Tailing, Online Hacking, and Online Decryption seem to be the most enjoyable modes but deal their own faults. The inability to hack/tail your friends in particular (even if no rewards were given due to possible exploiting) is a major disappointment. Online Racing is rather fun most of the time although laggy players will always be the bane of the game as you feel you’ve stepped into a scene from the movie, “Jumper”, watching a rivals car jump around the street and through obstacles.\n\nGRAPHICS: I personally felt most of the games graphics were spot on with very few instances to complain about. I do encounter slight choppy framerates when in high speed escapes/chases and have crashed every so often during such situations so optimization might still be a bit of an issue. The game runs rather nicely on a mid-range PC with graphics settings near maxed out (high on most settings) excluding the common stuttering problem stated above. I cannot chock the crashing to graphics so I don’t count that against it. The game has wonderful graphics and is definitely outputting some eye candy in my opinion but there is a large following of players that are HIGHLY disappointed that the graphics do not match the quality that was shown to them in the pre-release E3 trailers.\n\nFINAL NOTES: I loved Watch_Dogs and recommend it to friends daily for the fun gameplay and immersive storyline. If you can deal with a game that still has a few bugs to work out, and is in need of some serious DLC or additional content….you might want to give this game a try. I’d give it 3.5 out of 5 stars but only due to lack of content and slight optimization problems. Hopefully Ubi will put out some more updates with additional content to help spice up the game in the near future…..especially since they offered a “season pass” for purchase.","July 8, 2014","true","181.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Of course as many have pointed out, the game does not live up to its hype, so if you don't hype the game before purchasing you will have a very enjoyable experience. Thank god I didn't hype it because I love this game.\n\nGRAPHICS\nThe graphics in Watch_Dogs™ are quite enjoyable. The city of Chicago looks very good at day and the textures are very nice. At night though, it just doesn't feel like chicago and feels like the city is sleeping, even though Chicago is a "sleepless" city. Another huge issue in the graphics is the pop-ins. These pop-ins aren't anything minor. Any object (Car, Citizens, Destructable Items) will pop in if you are driving, this is not noticable while on foot but driving at high speeds and having something pop in and you crash into in, is very irritating.\nSCORE 7/10\n\nGAMEPLAY\nBeing able to hack objects and interact with them is a very nice feature, and makes combat feel fresh and fun. However in the missions, the level design is boring and very straightforward. Go here, hack this, kill these guys, repeat. Since hacking is such a huge part of the game, it feels very shallow, there are around 10-12 objects that you are always hacking. I feel like if Ubisoft added more objects to hack I would've enjoyed this game a lot more than I did, although I enjoyed it quite a lot. Gunplay is nothing new, though I like how it actually has recoil, making you not able to spray at every enemy you see.\nSCORE 8/10\n\nSTORY\nThe story is very cliche although there are a lot of plot twists that I actually enjoyed. Others said that the characters aren't memorable and that Aiden is very boring. Though I must agree on the first one, I cannot say that Aiden was a very boring protagonist. His mysterious tone made me really want to find out what this guy was all about. The ending was extremely bland and I felt like the mission before the final one was way more memorable. The story kept me interested, but not hooked.\nSCORE 8/10\n\nMULTIPLAYER\nThis feature was needed in order for me to get through some boring sections in the game. You can pick from a few modes, but I only played tailing and hacking. Like in Dark Souls, a player sneaks into your game without you knowing until the invader starts his actions. I hated being invaded, but sneaking into players games always had me in fear that I would be spotted, and it turns into some kind of hide and seek game. I really enjoyed playing this and had a blast.\nSCORE 9/10\n\nREPLAY VALUE\nThere is very little. Once you finish the story there are many activities to do, but I never got interested in them. Most of them are just more action and shooting scenes, which I had enough in the story. Maybe someone will enjoy it, but I didn't.\nSCORE 6/10\n\nFINAL VERDICT\nIf you don't hype this game up when purchasing it will be a very enjoyable experience.\n\nPROS AND CONS\n+Nice textures\n+Aiden is a very mysterious man\n+Lots of action\n+Lots of plot twists\n~Hacking is ok, but is very shallow\n~Story is cliche but is interesting at times\n-Night time Chicago looks awful\n-Many pop-ins in game\n-Characters aren't memorable\n-Not much to do after the story is finished\nOVERALL SCORE  7.5/10","April 10","true","26.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Let me set the damn record straight.\n1- I have 1 AMD 7850 graphics card and the game runs fine. You may have to update your drivers, but that's about as much of a hassle as jerkin' off.\nNo, it doesn't look like a Van Gogh painting, but if graphics are a dealbreaker for you, and Watch Dog's graphics in particular aren't good enough for you, then maybe you should stick your head in a cattle grate.\n2- I've been running this game in a hot, sweaty, muggy, closed off room to the point where my motherboard is screaming in agony and the game hasn't so much as dropped in frame rate let alone crashed. Again, if your game crashed or isn't running properly, try updating your drivers.\n3- The actual gameplay is the ♥♥♥♥. Once you get over the fact that it's one of those open world games where it's the side missions and stuff that make it an enjoyable open world and not the fact that you can pop random civilians and run away from the cops (even though that's just as great) it makes me want to have Ubisoft's babies. The stealth is incredible, the gunplay is fun, chasing down fools that broke the law like Batman is sweet, figuring out if I want to stop a convoy by driving a car laden with explosives straight at it or if I'd rather just hide behind a dumpster and send a grenade launcher shot at it is what makes Watch Dogs so much fun.\nAnd those people that are telling you the street light mechanics are useless...yeah don't listen to 'em. If you're not a three year old with no arms you'll be able to figure out how to use the street light mechanic to destroy a horde of cops chasing you.\nBut if the idea of sneaking around a parking garage, trying to take out a singular target when you have control over everything with electricity sounds fun to you, or if picking off twelve bad guys and then hiding in your car from the cops in an alleyway only to be spotted by a helicopter you didn't count on that makes you run on a sweet ♥♥♥ car, free-run, motercycle, boat chase across Chicago sounds like a good time, then get Watch Dogs.\nBecause if that doesn't sound fun to you, you need to check yourself into a mental institution.\n4- UPlay. Yeah I get it, it's the antichrist.\nBut if you're really going to let a cumbersome, poorly polished, crappy excuse for a piece of software get in the way of this otherwise perfect game, you're punching yourself in the balls.\nAnd no one likes getting punched in the balls.\nSo buy Watch Dogs.","May 30, 2014","true","51.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/adamcass/recommended/243470/","adamcass","Trumpkinator","http://steamcommunity.com/id/adamcass/","54 products in account","I would recommend that you, in the future, play Watch Dogs. It isn't great, and certainly doesn't live up to the hype, but the elements that the developers have combined are really interesting and unique. The 'hackability' isn't overly in depth, and you end up mashing the 'Q' button to hack things, and the open world is rather lackluster and bland. Don't get me started on the driving, it is so arcady it isn't funny. Far worst than Driver San Fransisco and GTA 4 driving mechanics.\n\nHOWEVER, I think this game does have a lot of potential. While it is somewhat disappointing, I actually had quite a bit of fun. The story if fantastic, so far, and the city, and the AI, feels very human and realistic.\n\nI haven't experienced any performance issues, surprisingly, with a GTX 650ti, 16GB Ram and an i5 4670k. I'm sure Ubisoft is working on it, in an effort to improve relations with their PC audience.  Uplay is a pain, it's a rather annoying hoop to jump through when all you want to do is play the game.\n\nI don't think this game is worth $80AU. But it really is worth playing, and I'm confident it can only get better as Ubisoft addressed (hopefully) the issues that have been outlined by the players. So I reccommend holding off now, because you will be dissappointed, especially if you have an AMD card.","May 30, 2014","true","32.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fallen-angel0/recommended/243470/","fallen-angel0","HereticBlood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fallen-angel0/","88 products in account","This game was very overhyped and that was its downfall.  This game is good, but not in the way Ubisoft made it seem.  It is missing many features that many people, myself included, would have liked.\n\nYou take on the role of Aiden, a freelance hacker who is trying to get revenge on the people that ordered the hit on him, which in effect killed his young niece.  You fight using your wit of computers and a very nice extendable cane.\n\nThe Story: 7/10\nThe story of Watch Dogs is decent, but lacking many things.  Aiden isn't relatable as a character which makes him very hard to relate to while you play through his adventure.  The story has a couple of plot twists but nothing that a person who is paying attention could have caught onto at least half an act before the event.  The story split into parts is nice and allows the player do go off and do their own in between story acts.\n\nSide Activites: 4/10\nThis is where this game falls flat.  There are plenty of side missions like taking out gang hideouts, stealing cars and taking them to a drop off point, poker, virtual reality, taking down thug caravans, and hacking passerbys as you walk down the sidewalk.  However,  these activities are very lack luster and quite repetitive.  The fixer missions(stealing cars) are very annoying at sometimes and seem almost impossible to complete.  The same goes for the caravan missions.  The virtual reality and poker are boring and nothing fun is implemented in them. Hacking pedestrians is a way to gain money and unlockables at first, but as the story progresses it just becomes useless because  you can buy materials for crafting or the craftables themselves and not to mention you have a million dollars to do it with.\n\nMultiplayer: 6/10\nThe multiplayer was a great idea in concept, but fell short in execution.  You can get into other peoples' games and try to implement a back door virus (which basically means walk near them and hold the execute button than go hide) is fun for the first couple of times but is very annoying because the game gives the player your hacking a circle on their map which shows where you and it gets smaller the closer you get to winning.  Unless if your very good at hiding, the player with usally find you because they can hover their reticle over you for half a second and it tells them that your are indeed the jerk that invaded their world while they were heading over to play high stakes poker.  The race games are horrible because driving in general is like your on ice sliding back and forth.  The free play is fun if your playing with a friend, but Ubisoft didn't implement any activites for you to do while in freeplay.  You can't redo any of the side missions and basically all you do is run around shooting civis so you can get a car chase going.\n\nCombat/ Crime Mechanics: 7/10\nThe combat in this game is one of the redeeming factors in my book.  Your hacking is actually viable because you can distract a guard with their cellphone by making it go off which also distracts people near them.  The stealth is good and if you play your cards right you can take out a whole enemy group by distracting them, taking them down with either a melee cutseen or shot to the head with a silenced pistol (which is unlocked from the beginnning of the game :)).  The car chases were okay.  The whole idea of taking down the cops with barriers and then hiding with a blackout is fun, accept the godamn cars ARE ON ICE.  Another pet peeve of mine is your crime scale. You can run drive around breaking property or smashing into other cars being a ♥♥♥♥.  But the second you hit a pedestrian(which is going to happen since your DRIVING ON ICE) or shoot your gun, the whole ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ police force is on your ♥♥♥ ready to kill you.\n\nMusic: 5/10\nThe sound track is horrible in my opinion. It matches the feel of the game but the music is by people you've never heard of and usually you just turn of the radio and go on youtube on your browser.\n\nClosing Opinion:\nThis game had potential. The setting and whole aspect of the game is cool.  But in the end, execution fell flat and this game is just another play and pass type of games.  Maybe Watch Dogs 2 will redeem this series?\n\nStory: 7/10\nSide Activities: 4/10\nMultiplayer 6/10\nCombat: 7/10\nMusic: 5/10\nFinal Vedict: 6/10\n\nFinal Comments:\nYOUR DRIVING ON ICE!!!!\n\n\n","May 10, 2015","true","32.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

Giving it a bad score due to deception and poor optimization of the game. What you saw in the E3 game preview shows you what lengths a company like Ubisoft will go in order to sell you a game. I probably would be less annoyed by this if the price tag wasn't $60. I could see this game being sold at around $40 for the effort they decided was acceptable. Right now not many people, my self included, with computers that meet the system requirements (and many who go beyond that) have plenty of technical problems, FPS drops, stuttering, even game freezing for something that looks slightly worse than GTAIV. I hoped that the saving factor for the game would be the online multiplayer portion of the game, but as we all know uplay can't cut it. A lack of push to talk leaves you hearing someone breathing into the mic. Constant disconnects from either unstable servers, or players able to exploit the system by disconnecting the internet just as you are about to win a game to keep their score up. I'll use this as a reminder when ubisoft releases future games, especially The Division, a game I was also excited about. If anything Watch Dogs should serve as example as to why gaming companies should be held accountable for deceptive advertising, and we all remember Duke Nukem Forever/Colonial Marines.","May 29, 2014","false","22.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/THE_BATPOOL/recommended/243470/","THE_BATPOOL","HYBRID? MORE LIKE HYPBRID","http://steamcommunity.com/id/THE_BATPOOL/","136 products in account","After reinstalling, I found the fix to all my problems. I had the textures to high up for my computer, my bad entirely. I won't make a joke about this game, because it has enough gag reviews, however I would like to point out before I launch the full review, that you can drive around in a taco truck commiting crimes, I refer to it as the Taco Mobile. Pros and Cons at bottom.\n\nI'd like to start out by saying, this lived up to the hype for me. Everyone likes to whine and moan about "Oh the graphics aren't as good as it was at E3" "Preformance this, preformance that!" "Uplay!" I would like to clear all this up. The game isn't as good as it was at E3, and anyone who thought it was was kidding themselves. I don't feel like modding it to make it that good, the graphics are fine just the way it is.\n\nI did have slight preformance issues, but it was my own fault, and now that I fixed it, it runs just fine. In regaurds to Uplay, I think it's cute. It's genuinely cute that Ubisoft thinks they can match Steam with their own achievment system. It's cute, but annoying. Stop whining about it, they clearly won't stop, but uuuuhhhh Uplay? STOP. Geez I want freakin steam achievments not Uplay achievments. Gawd.\n\nI play this game with a controller, so my review won't include how the PC controls are. Get angry with me all you want, this is a console game, thus I play it like a console. I play the Assassins Creed serise this way, I play CoD this way, it's just more comfordable.  The controls work fine and I don't find them clunky, except pushing left stick to reload. That's it.\n\nGameplay wise, this game is fantastic. I love it. You aren't as OP as an assassin, so most of the missions will have you relying on your phone. Guns blazing is discouraged, luring your enemies into explosions is encouraged. Speaking of enemies, the AI in this game is great. Enemies will shoot and move in on where they think you are rather than where you actually are, and generally behave like they have a half ounce of grey matter between their ears. If I'm hunting someone, they'll try to run. If I kill someone, they'll talk amongst themselves and fan out looking for me. If I detonate the explosives in someones pocket, they do their damndest to get it away from them.\n\nA major complaint I hear is that the world does not feel alive. Having actually visited Chicago once myself, let me tell you, the world feels only slightly less alive then the actual thing. If you run into someone, they'll cuss you out and send you on your way. People stop to listen to freestyle rappers, gitaur players, drummers, etc. But there are some minor things. For example, civillains only have a chance to call the cops if you steal their car. Seriously? I just ripped you from your car and you just couldn't care less huh? Also, I can run over as many people as I like, no one gives a crap. Whip out a gun in public? Cops are there almost the second you pulled out your gun.\n\nThe main campaign is... Very underwhelming. I enjoyed the story personally. It's a nice little revenge plot, nothing really impressive. Aiden is one of my personal favorite characters, just because he's a pure and unfettered badass. The actual story gameplay though... It's just overglorified side quests. Speaking of side quests, this game offers few choices in that department. There's fixer contracts, aka races, there's crimes, which are way to easy, criminal convoys, fun and challenging, and then there's gang hideouts. Gang hideouts are fun, and they vary up about as much as the setting allows them to, I really can't complain about those.\n\nLets talk online multiplayer. Many people thought that online mode was the games strong suit. I beg to differ. I turned it off because I found it frustrating to one second me on my merry little way to my mission, then BOOM! Hacker. I don't like the concept, or anything about it, but this is just my personal taste.\n\nIn conclusion, Watch Dogs has it's flaws, but it's still a solid game in the end, and I'm happy with my purchase.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n-Fun gameplay\n-Buckets of Chaos\n-Cool story\n-Decent graphics\n-More challenging than Assassins Creed\n\nCONS:\n\n-Repetitive missions\n-Boring side characters\n-Side quests are both to easy and to hard\n-Multiplayer is intrusive unless turned off\n\nNOTES:\n\n-Wait til it goes on sale, 40$ isn't an acceptable asking price\n\n\n80/100 - Fun game, with room for improvement. I'm looking forward to Watch Dogs 2.\n\nFeel free to send me review copies if you like my "serious" reviews, and keep an eye out, I intend to open a propper steam curator group.","May 5, 2015","true","15.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

No wonder I am a bit dissapointed.\nDriving mechanics are very important in the game, but are botched hard. Cars behave very unrealistic, kinda like tanks (though at hacked intersections they blow up instantly for some reason),\nGame has the worst optimization I have ever seen, with not special graphics or huge world, but stuttering strangely (and almsot the same on low as on ultra, which is strange).\nStuff to do is time consuming, but not very exciting, almost boring. And this is just my first impression after few hours played.\nMultiplayer doesn't work too much yet, possibly because uplay is overloaded and misbehaves.\nWe need patches and drivers. As of now the game is rather... Well, not much. 7/10 would be my score.\nPossibly higher, if they fix the multiplayer matchmaking (or just get the servers stable) and fix the issues the game has with optimization.\nIt says 6 gb ram minimum, 8 recommended? It is a scam, game never used over 2.2 gigs for me. Total load of mine is 4.2/8 gb.\n\nCity does seem to be detailed, there are few interresting things to do, the story is craftedy nicely... Good work, but not a breakthrough, just a proper craftmanship.\nFor some reason, it kinda reminds me more of prototype than gta game. I can not get the same level of immersion from it for some reason.\n\nIn short:\n\nGood game?\nYes.\n\nDissapointed?\nYes :(\n\nGraphics?\nNot spectacular (below GTA V imo)\n\nOptimization?\nTragic\n\nMusic/Sound\nAverage at best\n\nInterface?\nVery bad for PC (un-intuitive, surely made with consoles in mind)\n\nDriving?\nTragic car physics, tragic handling and... yeah. Bad. On par maybe with Saints Row 2 or worse? Everything new has better system.\n\nOverall I would still recommend trying this game. But don't get your expectations too high. Like I said, 7+/10 is tops in my opinion.","May 27, 2014","true","32.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","3"

This review is more of a first impressions kind of thing. I've only played for a good hour and a half and I have to say, this game did meet most of my expectations. I'm going to start with the bad. The game is horribly unoptimized on AMD cards which I have. I have an R9 270x and I always get a stuttering effect no matter the setting. The only way to improve it right now is to turn off V-Sync, AA, and set the GPU frames to 1. Even still, it stutters quite a bit. The graphics, while great, are not as good as the E3 2012 reveal which is kind of a dissapointment. The driving isn't bad, but I dislike the damage modeling. You can crash into so many things and your car will not have much damage to it. I wish it had a damage system like GTA: IV.  Some of the voice acting can be a bit bad, and so far the story isn't going anywhere special at the moment. (Though keep in mind it's only been 1 hour and 30 minutes).\n\nNow onto the good. The gameplay (Which I personally think matters the most) is very fun. There's a multitude of different things you can do in the city of Chicago and there is a ton of content here. Hacking is very fun and I love how every single pedestrian is interactive. You can see their background such as name, age, income, job and how hostile they are. Little touches like this bring the game to life. The physics are very impressive and I have to say that this is some of the best water effects I've seen in a game. The AI is also very good as well. They will react to different situations very organically. They may catch a quick glipse of you going into cover and rather then shrugging it off like in some games, they actually go straight to investigate. They also let their buddies know if anything is out of the ordanary. Very immersive stuff here. Lastly, I would like to mention that the animations are very well done just like in the Assassins Creed games.\n\nOverall, I am liking this game a lot. While it may not live up to all of the hype it set out to make, it is still a very fun game so far.\nGraphics: 8.5/10 - Very pretty game. Only negative being the bland light tone in daylight.\nSound: 8/10 - Voice acting can be iffy, but the sound effects are very good.\nGameplay: 9/10 - With so many things to do and hack, you will have a lot of fun with this game.\nOverall 8.5/10 - Very fun game.\n\nI will update my score when I beat it. This isn't a total score for the game but rather then just how much I enjoyed it at the moment. My full review will come in the next few days.\n\nI should also say that this score is not including the issues with my card I am having and I assume many others are having as well. That will reflect my final verdict.","May 27, 2014","true","11.7"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

The portrayal of the hacking is ridiculous to anyone with even rudimentary knowledge of how modern appliances and devices are built. For example: you can hack into and make explode the power transformers; or you can magically jump your hacks through line of sight of security cameras; or you can hack into forklifts; or you can hack into grenades of some enemies and so on...\n\nThe controls on foot feel either unresponsive or laggy. It feels like your character is a half drunk with stiff neck and generally numb muscles. Try quickly looking around - the controls feel too slow. Try aiming with precision - the controls feel too fast.\n\nThe stealth is simply incovenient. Separate keys to enter and exit cover. No key to just crouch or just stand. If your next cover has more than one side, you can only "jump" to the one that faces you. You cannot move or hide bodies. On the first disturbance your enemies will go into "super agitated" mode and will never exit it. Shadows appear to have no effect - if you are in line of sight at the right distance and angle, the enemy will see you. You cannot take out lights by shooting them.\n\nThe driving is equaly inconvenient. The cars feel like they buffer your input up the point and then execute it all at once. The 3rd person camera swings behind the car like crazy which makes you constantly loose bearings. The default angle (which constantly gets auto-restored) of the 3rd person camera hides the front part of the car, thus you cannot do tight maneuvers without often hitting something with the nose of the car.\n\nThe mission success requirements are often arbitrary and whimsical. For example, in gang dispersal missions you can't just kill the gang leader with his whole gang - you must knock the guy down. And then you can shoot him in the head, it does not matter anymore. In crime prevention missions - if the criminal sees you in the busy area at 20m distance, he will get spooked. Howether it does matter if there are 10 other people around, so long as one of those is not you. In driving missions, you escape the police and drive to one point, only then to be asked to drive to another point at the different end of the area, often having only one decent access road, while search spots pop on that road like crazy. And so on... Pointless, empty and arbitrary challenges.\n\nAnd police in this game are simply trigger happy idiots. It does not matter if they see you commiting a crime or not, if you have a gun in your hand or not, even if someone is shooting at you while you are unarmed. If someone fires a gun and you are nearby, the police will automatically assume you are the largest danger around and shoot you with extreme prejudice.\n\nIn the end, I just could not find a reason to enjoy this game. And I found many reasons to dislike it.","June 17, 2014","false","7.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","1"

I will still give this review! Watch_Dogs is certainly just another sandbox game like GTA or Saints Row. It virtually copies 80% of those games, in terms of enviroment, driving, killing, missions, etc. The thing that does set it apart though is an interesting take on the future and how everything can be hacked. Truely we live in a world now days where the power could be shut off via a hacker, so why not make a game about it? Yes it lacks in action, it lacks in being an original game (not including the hacking idea) and basically expects the player to waste hours on doing missions and side missions and the all important secret missions! But I must say, for a person who has played GTA and Saints Row, this game certainly has potential. I like the idea of being able to control the environment around me, to use to my advantage and help me out when I am being chased. It is a great idea and if they expanded on it more and stopped with the copying of GTA and Saints Row, I think this franchise could go far. Overall I am happy with the game, but regret buying it so soon. This is a game to be enjoyed, only when it is on sale! I give this 3 out of 5 Beers.

The performance is bad even on my high performance Machine. The highest Frames per second I got was 200 and was lag spiking whenever I was driving. There was a mod called "The Worst Mod" that unlocked better graphics and solved alot of the lag but yeah. Ubisoft has to fix there stuff and should not let people do it for them because they are to lazy... Team Fortress 2 for example, made in 2007 and still being updated!\n\nI Rate 4 out of 10 for this game because the game overall looked like Grand Theft Auto and the story was not good at all. The only things that where cool where online hacking and the random events you could do. I do not hope for an "Watch Dogs 2" or something.","October 8, 2014","false","32.3"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

So lets start with the first bad point: Optimalization. Well, this game doesnt have the best optimalization, but not the worst tho.. there are some floating walls bugs troughout the game, FPS drops etc.. but the game was still playable for me, i had 35-50 FPS on High settings (AMD FX 6300, GTX 750 Ti). Then the main character. Some people like him, some dont and im with the first group. But i have to say that he is not the best chosen main character that could be in the game. For example Bad blood DLC is significantly better than main game just because T-Bone fits better to the game than Aiden Pearce. However, thats all the bad things for this game. I have enjoyed it so much, and for me this game will remain as one of the best that was made, forever. Hyped for Watch Dogs 2. Definetly worth buying, but wait for sales and buy it for like 15€.","December 29, 2015","true","25.9"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","10","18","3","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WoolyBug/recommended/243470/","WoolyBug","WoolyBug","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WoolyBug/","771 products in account","Watch Dogs is a hard game to review. Not because of what it doesn't have, but because of the potential of what it could have been. It checks all the points when it comes to an Ubisoft Open-World game. A grand conspiracy, some sort of tower/place to unlock to allow further unlocks, and hundreds of worthless crap to unlock that never rewards the amount of time it actually took to unlock... But the main character you are playing is just not a person I like to represent. His whole demeanor is just "bad". He feels like a very narcassistic person, a person who in real life I would never assocait with.\nHow can I dig into a game and really feel part of it's universe if I do not like the person I am?\nThe game mechanics are okay, the shooting is about as solid as most open-world multi-role games like this usually are.\nThe driving model is horrible, which is strange considering Ubisoft's racing game experience. People were initially let down with this title because Ubisoft dangled an unrealistic shiny, perfect, photo-realistic carrot in front of us, then switched it out with a carrot that had been sitting out on the counter too long.\nLooking back at it without those expectations of greatest though, this game looks and plays like hundreds of others post 2012 open world titles. Somewhat resembles the city they take place in? check. Has important landmarks of said location? Check. Real world life-style and social cues from that era? Check? AI feels lifeless and less like an actual city and more like a computer simulation? Check.\nTo sum of it up, this game does what it says on the tin, but it doesn't do anything great nor does it really do anything new outside the "hacking" component, which any IT person would tell you is nothing like real world hacking. Real world hacking involves hundreds of late-night reading, studying and coding. Not a magic "hack" button as depicted in this.\nThe story is so full of twists, turns and nameless people that with over 90 hours I still only understand the very basics. Bad guys are trying to get me, I'm  trying to find bad guys. Roll Credits.\nIf you want a rating, then comparing to other open world games of this ilk (Grand Theft Auto, Assassin's Creeds, etc) I would rate this a 6 out of 10. COmparing to games in general I would bump it to a 7 out of 10.\n","December 26, 2015","true","89.6"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/243470/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3197 products in account","So. I'll skip over any discussion about optimisation and speed, my system being the terrifying beast that it is did not have any issues running this game at max settings and didn't drop below 60 fps. We can ignore the technical discussions and I'll leave that to the rest of the Steamiverse (yes, that's a word, I've made it, it exists) to discuss.\n\nThe big question is how does Watch_Dogs compare to the two important benchmarks in the field, the first being the immediate predecessor - Assassins Creed 4: Black Flag, And the second being GTA V. This is where the discussion starts getting a bit tricky, it would be far too easy for me to TLDR the review as Hacking Creed : White Jacket, but that's essentially what you're getting. The open world -feels- a lot like the AC4 open world, in so much as it's full of window dressing but ultimately you can boil it down to some shops which you buy stuff from, and a mass of side quest markers that you can interact with.\n\nThere's a but. Some things have been *lost* from the trip from AC4 to W_D, most notably that the Bunker feels like the biggest missed opportunity for Ubi imaginable, this could, should have been the place where Aiden and co built up a base and resources to open investigations, side quests and other opportunities, but in the end it's "just another hideout". That came across as a big disappointment, and I'm amazed that Ubi missed a trick on this.\n\nThe story too, for all the sophistication of the toolset and the world, isn't as sophisticated as it should have been. It's played as a straight revenge plot, when there was so much more that it -could- have been. The whole plot concerning bellweather and the political rigging, blume and the CTOS and how it connected to Chicago, these are themes that could have been explored in so much more depth, giving texture and a much more significant plot to proceedings, but instead we end up destroying a lot of the criminal underworld because Aiden is angry. Angry Aiden. This game demanded better writing, AC4 -got- better writing, why this game didn't, I'm a little bemused by.\n\nMy problem is that this game has a lot going for it, the AR games are insanity akin to SR4, the digital trips represent Ubi at their blood dragon best, Songsneak is a very clever idea, and the multiplayer implementation when it works (which isn't always as reliable as you might wish) is perhaps a collection of some of the most brilliantly thought out espionage gamemodes in an open world to come together. There's a lot of good here, but unlike CTOS, it's not interconnected, instead the brilliance is scattered among seperate threads that spiral off in different directions, and you end up seeing fragments of what could have been. A great game reduced to merely -very good- because Ubi perhaps lacked the bravery to commit to something more.\n\nBuyers remorse then, hmmm, no. I think in time, with the no doubt mass of DLC that will come down the pipe for it including T-Bone's campaign, we'll see a more fleshed out experience and possibly Ubi willing to experiment more with the themes they touched on in Aiden's story, but neither can I unconditionally recommend it. This is a good game that strives for greatness, but sadly falls just short. Unlike GTA V it lacks the sheer quantity of things to do to make it feel like a world come alive, and unlike AC 4 it lacks the "epic feeling" that made you grin when you were being a mighty pirate.\n\nSo close and yet so far.","May 31, 2014","true","37.5"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","0"

Driving isn't that great, but definitely not the ♥♥♥♥♥iest driving out there. There are a lot of things to do, but it just lacks some kinda feeling of exploration. It's quite irrational on my part, but perhaps I feel that way is because the game is too goal-oriented. Everything's on screen and you'll never wander around aimlessly.

I loved “Alone” – very creepy and gripping;\n-As well as stopping crime (and by that I mean following one person wherein that person either kicks ♥♥♥ or get their ♥♥♥ kicked which is where you come in);\n\nMultiplayer consists of:\n-Intrusion:Find the hacker or hack someone by blinding in and steal their money;\n-Online Races;\n-Team deathmach with decryption of the other team’s server and then attempting to get away with it;\n-Taking control of cops/chopper and chasing each other;\n-FREE ROAM!!!\n\nIn between you get to intrude into people’s lives by using your phone’s “profiler”. While I appreciate the devs showing today’s  post Raegan/post Bush America wherein most people are making something between 20K and 35K  annually, there are a few things I found that were off:\n-How does a fast food worker who makes $ 23,600 a year go to Iraq? Or anywhere else for that matter?;\n-There was a hispanic looking guy, the profiler said he opposed immigration, so I went to push him to see what's up, he replied something in Spanish...so yeah, a Spanish-only speaking dude who opposes immigration;\n-Others are pretty funny: "Recently joined the apocalypse survival group" or "Supports anarchy" (while wearing a suit and a tie);\n-A waste management guy is an “Amateur Astronomer” - hey, to each his own;\n-“Frequently purchases lottery tickets” - yeah, that's half of New York population right there and most of deli groceries’ business;\n- A 24-year old Asian guy with a white name who makes $ 71,500 a year as a webmaster reports of hearing voices;\n-Found a couple of sex addicts too;\n-A few naughty people download pirated media;\n- A junkie looking bald white guy who collects coupons makes $ 100.000 a year;\n\n-Once in a while you'll see a 30 something year old recovering from first stroke - btw, there are no fat people in the game, nor are there any kids, or any old people;\n-A 41 year old black male psychologist wearing a baseball cap backwards making $ 93,000 a year is charged with bigamy....wait what?;\n-Frequently visits porn sites”- yeah that’s pretty much everyone with an internet connection;\n-and then there are those who frequently watch torture porn....ummm...how much is "frequently" exactly? ;\n-and there are some things you'd rather NOT know - like when a guy who has a third nipple;\n- occasionally, you get to remote-trigger the explosives a guy is carrying, his last words were "oh NO! tell my wife I was...." boom!!!! As I used the profiler on the dead body it said: "wife recently filed a restraining order".\n\nI am obviously nit-picking just for the sake of it and I could go on and on but I’ve already spoiled enough. But I didn’t stop there, I wanted to push the game’s AI to its limits:\nSo I stood in line at the ATM machine. A lady was in front of me, she was about to use the machine when I pushed her, she said "excuse me" dropped her purse on the ground and started walking in another direction - I guess this is how good the open world games are gonna get at this point.\nInsofar as creating this extra dimension for NPCs that we have never seen before in any open world game is something that is very peculiar. It actually “feels” sometimes that it’s a human being with an actual life, or lack thereof. However, about an hour into the game and you'll start noticing same NPCs.\nUbi did try their best at having same looking NPCs wear different attires, so if you aren't looking too hard you may not notice that too much.\nAnd there are little things like when you hack trigger someone's explosives on their body they can actually pull them out and throw them away killing a civilian in the process.\n\nI am still confused about the morality system. For instance, stealing poor people’s money by withdrawing their funds from an MTA does not lower your reputation. Even if you do side missions you will keep gaining good reputation, however, in order to do those things you will frequently steal other people’s cars, break their cell phones, sometimes run over them and get them caught up in a line of fire, wreck city’s property. Now, in real world, even if one was to save the lives of 100 people but still killed one either by accident or by recklessness or WORSE, on purpose, then that person’s hero status  will be close to zero.  And I am still not sure what kind of perks I am getting by increasing notoriety.\nThere aren’t too many comedic reliefs in the game safe for some double entendras and some very dry humor. BUT, the funniest moments of the game is when you get to monitor people’s lives when breaking into an OS Tower OR when you reach The Bunker.\n\nBack to the core.\nThe first 20 minutes of the game kind of teach you how to pee, but it’s all within a context and all very helpful.\nNow this is NOT a GTA clone in the least.\n-there are bus stops but no buses;\n-there are cop cars that chase you when you commit crime but not cop cars at all if you just walk around behaving;\n-there are taxis but you can’t pay the cabbie to take you somewhere;\n-you cannot shoot while in a vehicle or on a bike;\n-you cannot pick your fallen enemies' weapons;\n-the soundtrack sucks;\n-there is no “leisure time” to play pool, tennis, or go out with your friends (not that these things are in the game). You have a clear mission, well, sort of, and you get the job done until you advance the next act. Oh, by the way, about the acts. There are 5 of them.  There are 9 main missions in act I, 15 main missions in act II, 6 missions in act III, 8 missions in act IV and one mission in act V.\nBut I did experience a level of immersion wherein I did my best to NOT kill anyone and to NOT be reckless. I found it very satisfying to take down CTOS guys without killing them. When it came to mercs or gangsters then I often made an exception in their case.\n\nI LOVE disrupt engine. I love the fact that you do not just reside on an island in the middle of an ocean (Ahem, GTA III, GTA: VC, GTA IV, GTA V). The textures are damn near photo-realistic, the vistas, the sky, the way the trees and the leaves move in random unison when it’s windy, the day/night cycle, the destruction, the physics are pretty much worked out except the car damage is unrealistic. Vehicles take a lot of hits to explode or even to get dents and be undrivable. Plus, any car you drive is like a bulldozer-mowing everything down.  I didn’t like that at all.  Unfortunately when you shoot in water there are no splashes, the lip sync is nonexistent.\n\nThe Map is very well done. It’s dynamic and well packed with content as well as real-life locations.\n\nThe upgrade system is very neat. And playing on "realistic" is fun however it sucks that you get to see through walls AND see your enemies on the map all the time.\n\nI could go on and on but I’ll stop. The game has been 5 years in the making, and it shows how much effort was put in it. It has its little short comings but I see this as a next step in gaming. And this is the first game because of which I took a day off from work…","May 27, 2014","true","157.3"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","18","34","0","12"

I wish I can have a thumb that goes in between. Because I thought the game was decent and just good, not great or game breakingly innovative but a good experience to play.\n\nTo start off you play as Aiden pearce who is a hacker and a vigilante one at that. He was hacking on a job when he called it quit causing a tragedy to happen. You'll have to play to understand. The game offers some decent storytelling that was worth playing for the experience, though is very linear in terms of choices and paths you can pick and decide.You can only choose some choices to be  good or evil in what you do which doesn't really alternate too much of the storyline at all.\n\nThe game is an openworld roaming with the gameplay involving alot of stealth and  cover shooting mechanic with the ability to hack thrown in  which can be fun and quite entertaining until it becomes a bit repetitive. Literally you can open a phone look at someone and as long as a person has a device on them you'll see thier information appear which is completely randomized, which can be quiteinteresting. The missions has plenty of missions you can take on which can be repetitive and the main storyline mission and not much more than that, the game has a good experience but didn't offer meatier content.. There is limited parkouring and climbing you can do but you cannot jump in this game which drives me in♥♥♥♥ingsane  (in one of my video going for a top of the ledge(see bottom). The game itself has a nice leveling system set up in a way so that you can unlock new abilities that you progress enabling cooler and better hack. They are cool but the idea wears out after you unlocked the last one. Aside from that you can also craft items that will aid you in your missions.\n\nThe graphics are decent but the physics to the game felt very i and too solid. The texture itself can be pretty at some area but downright horrible in other areas along with poor optimization and locked graphical enhancements. Also with mod you can get a more stable play of the game + graphics that was shown to you at E3.\n\nThe multiplayer in the game is really intresting, as long as the game is set public people can basically invade you during the game anytime they want and once that happens you'll have to find them to rank up. At the time Uplay was having massive issues because of the amount of people logging in and the server not being able to handle it, whenever I could get my hands on the multiplay it was fun and enjoyable, though now none of that problem exist because people have moved on and only a handful still plays. One of the multiplayer mode that should had been enjoyable is free roaming but instead there is NOTHING TO DO and that mode is completely BORING because there isn't anything to do besides shennenigans. Also note there is no anti cheat of any kind implemented so the cheating going on now deterred me from the multiplayer and so I moved on.\n\nThe game itself uses Uplay which might suck but the game belongs to them so what can you do except voice out your opinion about this.\nOptimization really is not that great for this game, alot of the materials that looks great for it is hidden, which a modder found out about and unleashed.\n\n\nBe warned about system specs though. Hopefully people will be able to enjoy this title but it seems most of the complaints are specs, optimization problems etc because the massive issue is certain people can run it fine, many cannot so hopefully patch fix this. I can run it fine so my review is on the game itself.\n\nThis is my spec and it works atm.\n+CPU: Intel Core i7-3960X Extreme Edition +Memory: 64 gig ddr3 2133 Gskill +Video Card: 1x =EVGA 680 GTX SIGNATURE EDITION SUPERCLOCKED\n\n\n+  voice acting and dialogue really well done voice acting on aiden and nice job on the other characters.\n+ The Story is decent.\n+ Graphic options that tries to push pc to limit (Note: But fails due to optimization problems atm) Does/will look good if it works and when it works. too bad it didn't look like E3.\n+ Hacking is a really fun concept but could use alot more work in the future otherwise sometimes repetitive in terms of missions etc camera switching jumping.\n+  music and soundtracks fit the game perfectly\n+ Tons of weapons and perk unlocks\n+ Openworld roaming of up to 8 players, 1 vs 1 hacking, tailgating, racing, and game invasions. adding replayability. + leaderboard rankings. Though uplay was down on the first day\n+ 20 hours if you take your time to find EVERYTHING, 10-12 hours if you rush the single mission\n+ Very Good Amount of Collectables to unlock from side missions to minigames you can play + multiplayer to unlock perks, weapons, and vehicles.\n\n-While multiplayer is fun, the Free roam mode needs alot of work, it is SUPER BORING and offers nothing to do at all besides driving around and shennenigans.\n-Not the next gen game as they promised. The graphics were hidden so it caused an uproar until it was unlocked.\n-Physics are not next gen at all. Things felt very solid alot of time.\n- Uplay service is MEH, having problems finding the multiplayer game when you want to, takes 2-3 mins to find a game. In fact its not working right now so I am bummed out, WAS working fine.\n- The specs will affect some people hard, in fact many people, but the game does run fine for some and really horrid for others.\n- Game will require you to purchase Deluxe edition + Season pass to get the full content + hours more of contents. Otherwise you're missing out\n- Driving Could use alot more work, only great when you update perks a bit but not much, not only that car feels like heavy bricks in terms of handling, when you bump into things it goes flying but the car takes no damage unless you take really really hard hits. Damage also isn't as great but looks fine.\n-You'll have to get deluxe and then seasonpass and then more to get more content of course...\n- Optimization sucks and sucks hard, IT SUCKS THE HELL OUTTA YOUR PC, IT NEEDS WORK HOPEFULLY WITH PATCHES!  Some people are able to play this game flawlessly, Others cannot. So I can only imagine the problems and hell they are going through.\n- doesn't have enough content.\n- No anti cheat, cheaters plague the game multiplayer now and so I moved on.\n\nThats pretty much it, enough said it is a great game, worth the purchase if you can RUN IT and probabaly a good play thus far until something better comes along. Waiting on GTA V\n\nI've retyped this entire thing because the original one looked like ♥♥♥♥ and I was unsatisfied with it.\nCome invade me if you find me. When Uplay works.\nUplay - Kenuty\n\n- This is why not being able to jump in the game is stupid- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPa8EcHiQbI&list=UUXGd7RegfStA25hUftOyVfw\n\n-Online Gameplay video -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHAwkbDqSSE&list=UUXGd7RegfStA25hUftOyVfw\n\n-Video Review - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HjlcQXSG4&index=4&list=UUXGd7RegfStA25hUftOyVfw","July 12, 2014","true","42.1"," 20 of 38 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","20","38","0","0"

Although incredibly overhyped if you're still not tired of classic Ubi mechanics you'll really enjoy this game. The hacking mechanics are incredibly simplistic however, press button to hack. However it does create a decent amount of variety to keep the game from getting stale. The story was interesting enough to keep me playing through to the end although I found Aiden to be quite unlikeable. Some of the stuff you can do in the game such as killing pedestrians and stealing money from them also at times doesn't quite seem to fit the character and does seem a little jarring from time to time. The online funtions work really well and were actually quite fun, yet it's not my kind of thing so I appreciated the option to turn all the online features off. Overall the game shows alot of potential for the inevitable sequal and I would reccomend this game for anyone interested in buying it.","October 16, 2014","true","111.2"," 37 of 72 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","37","72","0","0"

Chicagos open world was vast one of my favorite open worlds to explore it my have lacked a little divercity but it was incredibly slick the large buildings in the mad mile look magnefecient the cars look really slick mimicing BMWS and Mercedies cars which makes you feel badass. As much as I enjoyed the game it did have its problems so hear is the 6 things that could be improved\n\n1. shooting out of cars I know the hacking was supposed to be your weapon but it would have braught another layer to the driving\n\n2.a better song selection common I dont want to listen to emo music and rap lets listen to some glitch mob and more electronic stuff\n\n3. customization would have been greatly loved by me at least because then I could make the game my own there would be car cuztomization, gun customization, and more clothing customization\n\n4. as cool as chicago was it still lacked in the divercity department I would have liked to see the parts of the city exaggerated for example the shity part of town would look really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphity everywhere no cops to be found but in the rich part of town there would be more cops no craphitty huge towering builings mdern art and really rich looking ai\n\n5. make aiden pearce a much more interesting character\n\n6. have more cops and gang members roaming the streets and have shootings between the two occur\n\nTo summerize I loved the game but it did not have things it needed to make it great. size wise it is well worth 59.99$\nbut quality wise it wasnt fully up to pare. I definetly reccommend this game to anyone who can look past this games problems and enjoy it for what it is.

My machine can handle extreme settings.. So I downloaded what's dubbed as "The Worse Mod" which made the game look amazing on my screen, but I did remove it to really feel how the game was intended. But I feel Ubisoft should have left those graphical capabilities in for the people who can run them, that's why we can change that stuff right?\n\nNow I understand some people report to have a terrible time even getting it to work, I'm happy to say I did not have no such issue once... Until I tried to record gameplay footage and it kept crashing until I disabled the Uplay Overlay\n\nThe game functioned very well with a controller even though periodically I had issues with it acting like I did not have one connected resulting in me playing with a keyboard for a little bit until I decided to restart the game, no big deal to me.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe game was hyped up to be this awesome sandbox experience with some free running and hacking elements and I'm sure some people including myself were comparing it to Grand Theft Auto in some to many ways... And truthfully Watch_Dogs falls short by a mile.\n\nHacking is all done with 1 button aside from some minigames which are all the same and quite boring\n\nDriving a lot of the cars either feel like boats or like I'm on ice, now after geting the feel of each and every vehicle I got very good at controlling them and they are easily adaptable which is nice. I was saddened that you could not do Drive-Bys instead you had to Race through areas and try to find hack points which the game pretty much told you the opportune time to hack so you never miss (Hack Aimbot is OP) I feel it should be more like a timing event where I have to mentally check it on the map and guess when they run over it.. make it feel more real.\n\nTo continue on the driving portions they seriously lack, it's either races, chases, escapes, or difficult Point-to-Point trials. Not many escort missions maybe a couple if I can remember them properly.\n\nCombat, there's two ways to go about it, stealth or guns blazing... frankly it's easier to mix the two and use the Spec Ops Pistol.. it's literally the only gun I used the whole game and I never bother sneaking past any one because the AI was just dumb in my opinion and were very easy to knock out or kill.\n\nI was okay with the small arsenal, I understand the situations and you really don't need a large arsenal like in other games\n\nAnd even with as much killing as I did, I never lost my Vigilante Rating since the Karma events (which were almost always saving someone from a potential threat) gave so much positive it was counter-intuitive especially since messing up didnt impact you much either, you actually have to work to be a bad individual\n\nMinigames, Poker was good when you played honestly instead of cheating with the camera in the room.... The drinking minigames though oh my god the last one, the hard one bits of it were so incredibly hard I rage quit several time (was trying to get all the achievements)\n\nOnline, "Just no" its boring everything but the races is pretty boring.\n\nSoundtrack is "okay" it's not the best, they should have added more of a variety, I only listen to about 10 songs in the whole game.\n\nEarning money, frankly they should just remove money it's too easy when I can just hack someone and earn $12,000 do that for an hour in the rich sections and you can buy everything in the game, I know this because I did it. It's pretty much like the book "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" where Lisbeth Salander literally made herself a millionaire by hacking for a few minutes... (Great book you guys should read it)\n\nSTORY: WARNING SPOILERS BE ADVISED\nSTORY: WARNING SPOILERS BE ADVISED\nSTORY: WARNING SPOILERS BE ADVISED\nSTORY: WARNING SPOILERS BE ADVISED\n\nOkay so we have this guy, he does bad things like hack people and people he really shouldn't hack in a city where big brother is always watching with CtoS "Sigh" feels like a theme with so many things. But he loses his niece because a stupid hitman messes up his job. So we play as bad guy Aiden Pierce who literally ruins everyone elses lives just to get revenge... in the process does a few good things but mainly bad things... (And on this note he can hack bank accounts and can't even get his nephew a birthday present)\n\nAiden has almost no emotion, players can't connect with him, they can connect more with the girl he meets or the paranoid older guy about mid game (And if you do know the book I mentioned earlier this girl bears much resemblance to Lisbeth Salander except shes acts like a scared child most of the time). I felt more connected to the random events of NPCs in really awkward conversations and events when you spy on people like a creeper.\n\nBrings me to another point, Ubisoft said there was little chance to find the same NPC multiple times... I HAD to test this .. I found the exact same person in different parts of the city 67 times and I now have a log of probably a vast majority of NPCs\n\nAnd really the rest of the game is pretty self-explanitory from what I mentioned.\n\nUbisoft even went as far to make a DLC where players can do more crappy missions with an alcoholic metal head, okay yes he has more personality but the DLC is equally as boring in my opinion.\n\nIf they make a Watch_Dogs 2... just please don't unless they fix a lot of things, or Just stick with Assassin's Creed and Far Cry... I suppose though most of us are spoiled by Grand Theft Auto and some of us Saints Row","December 28, 2014","false","15.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is gameplay wise for the most part but Ubisoft Ruined it by downgrading the graphics.  Not only that the performance of the game is Garbage.  It is as though  through out the 5 years of working on this game they never spent any time Optimising Nor did they ever play the game them selves.   Trains stop on a dime if you put ur car infront it it, That is something you would expect to see out of a game from the 90s  not Now.    Ubisoft Has been so Disappointing lately  and heh frankly I am done with their BS.    They are fancying Consoles over PC and so that Consoles do not feel left out they nerf the graphics quility for their PC games.  But doing so Hopefully will hurt them in the long run.  I want to see Ubisoft go down for what they have done.\n\nAlso  Game is 12 gbs  Not 25 gigs,  Good luck being able to run the game with a 560 ti when My 760 ti hardly runs it and gets 30 frames.    The sound cuts out ans crackels and pops a lot with surround sound headsets.  You will need a $2000 Intel I7 and a $3000 GPU  to maybe get 40 frames do to the lack of how much ubisoft cares.\n\nGame is good, but Do not buy it, Do not support Ubisoft.

Yes. Did it live up to the hype? No, but nothing really every does fully meet the hype around it. Does Ubisoft suck for nerfing it? Yes. Does Uplay still suck? Duh. Is it worth getting? Yes.\n\nVery quickly I could reconize that this game was made by Ubisoft. If you look at their two flagship series (IMO) Assassins Creed and Far Cry, its very obvious, and almost too simular. You climb towers/buildings to unlock "vision" in an area, a variety of "main" sidequests and then others that are fairly irrelivant (i.e. Hard drives in WD and the little statues in FC3), half way through the game money isn't a problem, even T-Bone and Hurk are one and the same between the games. The same goes for assassins creed mechanics, but I played Far Cry 3 more recently so its easier to draw the comparisons to Far Cry 3. All in all, the mechanics are very simular between the games, so much so that they just feel the same, like clones of each other. And if they are copying so much over from other games, I expect that would be very refined, and it isn't, but that brings me to my next point.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are awful, they really hinder from having a good, fun, and fullfilling emersive experience. The game almost requires a controller over keyboard/mouse due to the driving and stealth mechanics. I get that it is very hard to overcome with a keyboard and mouse, but it really feels like they didn't even try, the controls are just awful. Next, the thrid person camera doesn't track properly, expecially when driving. It can sometimes be the most difficult aspect of fighting a enemy. But lets go back to the driving mechanics for one moment, and I this also ties into the A.I. as well. How is it when I am in the fastest car in the game, a police SUV and catch up to me? Or how they won't break the law and won't drive on a sidewalk, but running people over to try to push me into a wall is completely fine? The morality of the A.I. in the game is laughable, and when a game revolves this much around morallity, it needs to be spot on to not be a joke, which it is. Speaking of fighting... it isn't horrible. You have the typical stealth vs run and gun and everywhere in between (like other Ubisoft games, go figure). One sometimes can't kill the person, they have to "take down" the enemy, although they don't make it very clear whether or not one is allowed to just kill an enemy, which can be frustrating. The enemies are also blind as a bat, which I guess is added in there to make it easier, but the vision system is still poorly done, especially compared to Ubis other games. All in all, most of the mechanics are at least slightly broken, some of them just about ruin the game (like driving) but for the most part they aren't bad enough to ruin the game completely, as you can see by how many hours I racked up.\n\nThey story is pretty good. Voice acting is very strong, and so are the personalities. I would have liked T-Bone to be around earlier in the game for good comedic relief, but thats very minor. But, everything was predictable (which is what makes a good story nowanddays), which I saw coming, but even still, there was no suprise or shock left in it, nothing really got at my emotions. I did enjoy making the choice at the end (again, very similar to FC3, come on Ubi, diversify, you can do it!) so I am glad they included that. The story was good, worth at least two play throughs, Jordi really made it for me, I just wish he had a bit more comedy (or a chance to entertain in place of T-Bone) but still, a good and worthwhile story.\n\nThe online I didn't play much of because I can't stand it, its terrible IMO. Wasn't worth messing with.\n\nSide-quests and mini games: I don't really care for the mini-games and digital trips, but thats just me. The fixer contracts for the most part were fun, others very frustrating (and in a bad way, its no like they made it difficult, it was just a lack of refinement. Things that could have been ironed out but weren't) but for the most part a possitive experience. That various gang side missions were fun, they were enjoyable and well done, they had a range of enviroments to make it a fresh experience everytime.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Obiviously, yes, thats what I voted on. It may seem like I am really down on the game, but thats just because Ubisoft backed themselves into a corner in a lot of ways. Its fun, worth a play through or two, but it could have been so much better with just a little bit of refinement around the edges. It makes me sad to see the potential in the game compared to what it is. That being said, its a good game, but should be a great one.\n\n","July 7, 2014","true","507.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is solid, the driving is arcade-y and not incredibly realistic. It will take some time to get used to. The cover system is actually very nice and responsive. The shooting is decent so no real argument about the gameplay itself. But Ubisoft downgraded this game and it has very much affected my trust in the company (Not that I had all that much to begin with). The optimisation is abysmal and even on a beast of a PC it runs below 60 FPS. In short, sure it’s a good game, but it’s not a great game. Also I hate Uplay as much as the next man but it’s not all that bad. 6/10","June 23, 2014","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Ubisoft formula (Open world collect-a-thon, liberate this, etc.) can be fun the first few games, but after a while it gets old real fast. Watch Dogs does almost everything Assassin's Creed and Far Cry does, but with the twist of hacking into things.\n\nIt's fun, don't get me wrong, but I have played this game in other games. The story isn't exactly exciting, but it is interesting. The digital trips are essentially mini-games and they have some Saint's Row like feeling to them, but they feel a little out of place.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LilithAkuma/recommended/243470/","LilithAkuma","Medusa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LilithAkuma/","94 products in account","The game has been overhyped, and before the delay and PS4 devkit showcase, they were making it look like they'll let the game live up to E3 2012 reveal demo. However, after the dev kit footage was showcased, one saw a very big cut-down in graphics. That being said, it's not only graphics which suffered from that. The culprit? Consoles and Greed. The game was designed with consoles in mind, and the engine (Disrupt) itself was cut on several trees in order to make the game playable on X360/PS3, and both of those look like a mess. Ubi Montreal also mentioned how hi-budget the thing was. Let's see. $68M budget. Should be enough to live up to the expectation ladder set by the self-created hype, no? No. The point is that Ubi wasn't making the game with a great experience in mind, they've made it with money in mind. While the textures on PC are slightly upgraded from E3 2012, everything else is cut down and you'll find lots of bugs. The reflections of exteriors are pre-rendered textures which will give you the same view no matter what, the car damage models are garbage, as is the handling system. Also, ever noticed that most open world games have radios while driving? Watch_Dogs has playlists, which are occasionally interrupted by ctOS or other news, mostly campaign-related or trivial. Even GTA III had a consistent radio lineup, which is 13 years old (The original GTA III, not the 10 year anniversary revamp for iOS/Android.). Also, drive around on L-Train tracks, and look at them. 90 degree turning points? Rails that lead to nowhere? I think the issue here is that Ubisoft hyped a half-♥♥♥♥♥ game to something ambitious. While the graphics are still acceptable for the current time being, they do not hold up to the E3 2012 demo. Take a look at that, then take a look at the retail version. Where's the vivid and lifelike lighting? Where's the great night lighting that made their iteration of Chicago look so gorgeous at night? Where are the voluminous gas station explosions? Clearly, Ubisoft didn't aim at witty gamers, which is further confirmed by their hackable billboards. Yes, the memes used to be funny, and still are if used right, but where's the relevance? Now, let's look at the PC version in particular. While it indeed introduces a few new technologies from nVidia, AMD users are currently out of luck for proper optimization for whatever hardware war (again). For those who easily suffer from motion sickness in games, I recommend not to enable the motion blur, because it's a passive-aggresive overkill of motion blur. Otherwise, the settings have a decent amount of things to tweak, even includes controller support. But the mouse acceleration in the menu is a nuisiance, it's simply too fast and pointless. Oh, did I mention that it uses Uplay, the mess Ubisoft claims to be its home-made competitor to Steam? Don't get fooled by it. While it may have some similarities with Steam, Uplay only has one purpose: DRM, the restrictive way. They've just added achievements and "Uplay units" to it. The whole thing is also bloated with ads about Ubi games/trailers and whatnot. "Oh, you've played this game? Check out the trailer of this game! Pre-order that game now!", and it gets worse: Uplay servers are jacked up to the max. Even after the official announcement of completed maintenance, 99% of all cases cannot create or connect to a multiplayer match. With that in mind, Steam is also DRM, but it is beneficial, as there's always ways to get games dirt cheap and whatnot. A few words about the story and gameplay mechanics. You're a greyhat hacker who seeks revenge on the one who caused a tragic family incident, and make affiliations to other grey-hat/black-hat hackers to further aid you in your quest. While open world with hacking is something innovative, and is something that is quite original, Ubisoft dumbed it down to "press X for awesome". Even campaign bosses and the final mission consist of, you guessed it, smashing a single button. The game was something promising as it was in 2012. Yes, I'm aware that that demo was scripted, but when someone showcases something like that, one should fullfill the expectations caused by his own reveal/showcase. Did I mention that DeMarco isn't included in the main storyline? No playing with euphoria like "That's the spot they revealed the game with!". All in all, the game is worthwhile for the decent storyline, but from a technological standpoint, it's garbage. Even high-tier PCs struggle to run it smoothly, and as said, it was designed with consoles in mind. I don't recommend buying the game for 60 bucks retail, because it's evidently not worth it. If you're still faithful with Ubi and W_D, wait until the game goes on sale and prepare for disappointment. With that in mind, this should be a reminder for PC gamers who get hyped up about E3 demos: Don't buy into those, we've come to a point where companies favor consoles because those can give them a profit buff, which is why many AAA games play sluggish on PC, they're simply not designed for PC. (Metro Last Light being the exact opposite: It was exactly designed to push visual fidelity to the limits with all available technologies PC offers.). That being said, W_D will be a personal reminder for myself of big disappointment.

Here is my breakdown of the pros and cons of the game.\n\nPros:\n-Entertaing gameplay, espically with a friend\n-Great multiplayer, kept me going on this game well after finishing every side mission\n-Lots of NPCs. Generic, space-filling NPCs, but they make it feel like a real city\n-Wide variety of guns and tools to suit any playstyle\n-Great grapics. Not what we were promised, but still amazing\n-Mother♥♥♥♥ing Spider Tank\n\nCons:\n-Some side activites feel forced, like they were put in so Ubi could say they had X many activties\n-Money is too easy to get. I had every item purchased halfway through the story\n-Ammo is never a concern. They may has well have given you infinite ammo\n-Some weapons are blatantly better than others\n-Unless you have a friend to play with, after completing the game there isn't too much replayability sans multiplayer\n-Cops have... Strange aggro systems. Smash ten people with a car? Fine. Pull out a gun in a back ally? All of Chicago is on you\n\nUplay has never irritated me, it is a minor inconvience, but not enough to stop me from enjoying the game. I highly reccomend this game to people looking for a different open world experience. Once you beat the game, jump into multiplayer (I think online hacking is the best mode). If a friend has the game, do some free roam PvP. Alot of the fun in Watch Dogs comes from creating your own situation. The game itself lacks polish, but through player interaction in PvP you can enjoy it greatly. Final opinion: 8.5/10 Good game with great ideas.","July 22, 2014","true","86.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a great game, despite some technical flaws and having to put up with UPlay.\n\nAll in all, the story is good, despite the odd moments where you feel disconnected, but it does have a proper ending and build up, you end up liking the characters and being pulled in.\n\nGameplay is solid, gun fights flow well (Despite the AI being so cautious and aim-bot like) so you have some fun, the car chases are where the game shines, though eventually it becomes monotonous.\n\nI'm interested to now go explore the side missions and see what the DLC has to offer.\n\nIn conclusion, great game, would reccomend.","July 9, 2014","true","20.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The people who aren't happy probably feel particularly motivated to speak out because 1) it was hyped so much, 2) the delay tends to make people feel like they better have made the game better than perfect with those 6 extra months, and 3) a lot of the problems are technical so you literally have nothing else to do but write a bad review while you wait for a patch.\n\nI've only played for a couple hours but this is definitely the exact game I expected, and I think my expectations were pretty high. All the capabilities I expected to have are here - it's basically like GTA with a form of magic. There's also other stuff I really appreciate like the ability to turn off your car and duck to hide, and the numerous different forms of multiplayer. Even the mini-games are better than one would expect - that's not chess you're seeing in the screenshots, it's chess-based puzzles, which are really fun and feel a lot less silly than playing a game in a game that you could just be playing somewhere else.\n\nThe only downside that I've encountered (since I've gotten lucky with the hardware problems) is the uPlay connection, and even that, I gotta say, has been very minor for me. I had to hit the logon button four times the first time I played. Then it worked, and has worked fine ever since. Multiplayer is dodgy, but it does work - I've never been able to find a game while searching for one but I've been successfully invaded to completion (I loved it) and my friend has done the iPad vs. mode with me (we lost connection before it ended, which did suck, but it was really fun for both of us while it lasted). There's another important point: the stuttering during the driving is not a graphical/hardware problem, it's the uPlay connection being unable to keep up with your character's speed. This is good news to my ears because it means that once the network adapts in a few days or Ubisoft shells out for more servers or whatever, it'll go away. If you really can't stand it (I don't think it's game-breaking, myself), just play in offline mode. You can do that, you know! It's not Diablo 3.\n\nBottom line: I can't imagine implementing the hacking powers better, and overall, it's the best free-roam game I've ever played. Yes, better than Red Dead Redemption (the gunplay isn't as good but that practically goes without saying). I'm really glad I didn't get scared off by this torrent of bad player reviews. The professional critics' reviews are actually more accurate on this one.","May 29, 2014","true","85.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
