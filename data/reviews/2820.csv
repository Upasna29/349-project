A series high point as many improvements to the older X games can be found here in X3TC. Improved interface and UI gives way to full keyboard and mouse control with a new and improved flight model. A much more polished sandbox experience provides a larger and more detailed universe complete with a fully dynamic supply and demand based economy that you can exploit, support, and or decimate on a small scale or faction wide.\n\nImproved combat from small fighters and scouts to massive capital ships and carriers. Different variations in ship types with upgradable engines and thrusters. Travel by stargate or use Jump Drives to instantly travel large distances through space. Varied assortment of ship systems and upgrades for specific roles that can all be created by NPC and or players complete with logistics and supply lines. Jump Drives require fuel and larger fleets will require support ships and stations to rearm and refuel.\n\nPlay to whatever style you favor the most at any time. From small scale skirmishes to large scale epic fleet battles. Traders, explorers, pirates, bounty hunters, mercenaries, haulers, miners, police, military, industrial, and civilian. Micro manage everything or automate it with RPG based NPC fleet and corporation controls. Industrial mining operations and station construction. Name your player, corporation, ships, and all of your assets. Fully simulated sandbox complete with a full array of terran and alien factions. Your actions will effect your reputation around the universe with each one. Play the story at your own pace with full 3D open world space flight where nothing is scripted and anything can happen, even full scale invasions.\n\nThe universe is alive with friendly, neutral, and hostile NPC's. Some will even offer you random jobs and trade. Fly any ship in the game in first or third person. Hire wingmen to fly your ships and protect your assets. Train soldiers for 3rd person boarding operations and defense. Deploy satelites to create a network for tactical and economic information in realtime. Explore the universe to find hidden stations and derelict ships. Perform spacewalks to claim and or repair ships. Keep track of your thoughts with the captains log as your experience unfolds.

Even when I found the script edit I was lost because of how big the game is. I then started to understand what I needed to do in the game. After a little while I found the game to be empty, not much was going on. No real wars or anything like that. I went through some really long missions and was starting to get sick of it already so I started to look for mods for the game. What I found was a rich list of really great mods which brings the game to life, I will add the link to the mods at the end of this review.\n\nWish the mods I give this game a 10/10. Without the mods I give the game a 6/10 or 7/10.\n\nThe graphics for the game are good and it is fun to fly around and build space stations.

It actually has all the elements in place to make it truly great -- a huge, explorable universe, a complex economy, a huge variety of ships that each have their own use, a nice backstory, good graphics and music -- but it has some really critical flaws with playability that make the overall experience extremely tedious.\n\nThis is really three games in one: In the early game, it begins as a 3D space combat and flight simulator, and succeeds quite nicely at this. But in the later game, as you accumulate more resources and ships, it becomes more of a economy/trading simulator and fleet command style of game.\n\nThe critical problem is that the entire interface is designed around first-person navigation and combat, and controlling groups of other ships involves absolutely enormous amounts of navigating through menus for even the simplest task, like "move here". Secondly, ships move *very* slowly in this game, even with the built-in option to speed up time by 10X. Thirdly, trading ships, even the upgraded ones that are supposed to be self-sufficient, are stupid and require lots of hand-holding. The net result is that, once you have a large economy and fleet of ships, you will spend 30% of your time in menus, 69% of your time waiting for ships to move from point A to B, and 1% of your time actually doing whatever it is you intended to do in the first place. To build, equip, and move a medium-sized fleet into position to attack something is the work of several hours (not counting the time needed to get money for it), which is just absurd.\n\nWhat this game *desperately* needs is a way to toggle between first-person cockpit style view and a third-person, RTS-style, "fleet commander" view to ease management of large numbers of ships.\n\nOther minor criticisms are that the voice "acting" is generally terrible (major characters are often voiced by obvious computer-generated text-to-speech), and the quests are pretty simple "go here" or "deliver this to there". The different sectors start to all look the same after awhile. Also, there aren't many capital ship battles, a problem that was fixed in the expansion, X3: Albion Prelude. However, none of these are major problems in what is essentially an open-world game. The only critical problems are the interface and speed of doing anything, but these are enough to make the experience really frustrating.\n\nAll this said, if you have lot of patience and a lot of time to burn, I would actually recommend this game. For others, no.","July 15, 2015","false","343.7"," 137 of 171 people (80%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","80","137","171","10","8"

Simply because X3: Terran Conflict (and other X games) are some of the best games EVER made. I would actually hesitate whether to still call this a game. It will steal your life.\n\nFirst things first. It's probably gonna be easy for veterans of previous X games to get into this one, few slight changes but the same mechanic in a nutshell. For the others though, be warned! This game has one of the steepest learning curves I've ever experienced in a game, yet it is also probably the most rewarding. You start out with one ship in a vastness of space and you can virtually build a galactic empire with hundreds of ships, factories, and resources at your disposal. It's not gonna be fast, it's not going to be easy, but it's going to be fun! And you can really do it! No MMO has ever come close to the level of freedom and complexity of all the mechanics in this game. No other sandbox game provides such a beautiful playground for making all your dreams of becoming an overlord come true. It's a gem, an absolute beast of a game, so patched and so loved that even when the developers provided little to no tutorial (very extensive manual however), you can get all the information you need to become great relatively easily.\n\nIt's difficult to recommend this game to just one group of players. You can get a lot of fighting experience in this one, which I personally enjoy very much, but it's not a simple grabba shipz and go pwn everybody rite nao. No... You have to work on your reputation with a faction, you then get to buy the ship of your dreams, then you have to take it and slap dozens of upgrades on it to make it really shine and then you go get yourself some kickass weapons. I love maintaining all these little details, you can change your weaponry on the fly and tear all kinds of enemies apart. There are limits of course, but lemme tell you... I did destroy a class M6 bomber with about 150 MJ shields with a little M5 ship that only has 1 MJ shield.... I did take out a Kha'ak corvette with my M3 Mamba thanks to an insane firepower provided by Mass Drivers and their non-existent energy consumption. This might not mean anything to you now, but trust me, when you get there and live it... you will remember ;)\n\nOoooor you can pretty much just ignore the whole shooting thing and become a filthy rich and successful trader and buy everyone :D The story isn't important, you write your own. The graphics are very good in my opinion. Music and sounds are more than adequate. Mostly you won't even notice the music, which makes those rare moments of entering a sector that's different than all the others that much more enjoyable.\n\nThis game is about options, freedom and passion for honing all your skills. And I love it.\n\nPersonal rating 10/10","December 27, 2014","true","176.9"," 60 of 61 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","60","61","2","0"

I think I can put forward an honest review, or opinion, on the game without sounding a like total *&6^ by jumping in guns blazing, yeee haaar!!!... which I've done.  At this point I have a few decent ships, some credits in the bank, and the game makes sense.  I've never played this type of game before.\n\nTHE BEST (excuse the capitals) free roaming space game I've played, and I've barely scatched the surface.\n\nIf your holding off on playing X3 because you've read or someone warned you of a learning curve then I'd ignore it, slap them in the face and throw and glass of water over your shoulder.  There is a lot to learn, not doubting that, but if you just start and mess around then you travel along the curve, there's no need to understand and know about the entire game before you can access it.  My experience went as follows;\n\n\nstarted game as humble trader\nstarted flight school\ngot bored of flight school\nwent wandering off\nspend 20 minutes and 4 cups of tea travelling to other sectors\nbought some meatsteak cahoonas\nwandered off in another direction\ntried to figure out what to do with meatsteak cahoonas\nlooked for an 'eat' or 'grill' button on dashboard\ncouldn't figure it out kept wandering\nthree hours pass\nfinally discovered SATA\nbought some energy cells\nsold meatsteak cahoonas\nwent for a sleep\n\n**10/10 would travel again\n\n\n-----------------More Info, Read On ----OR---- Look Away Now-----------------\n\nThe best thing you can do if you ask me (nobody did for the record) is buy and sell energy! cells, nearly everyone in most sectors uses them and it's an easy start to get some credits and explore the game while taking in what the &^&% is going on.  I've never played a game that leaves you actually feeling like your inside the game, some do, but with this I actually do just dissapear into the X universe for like day, infact some days I prefer it being here.  It's a good place to go if you need a break, take a holliday.\n\n-----------User Interface---------------\n(scuse me while I get teknical) It's pretty easy to navigate, and looks good, small text, lots of data, blue text on the cross hair centre bit isn't so clear against some backgrounds, i.e. your flying towards a structure looking to dock and you can't tell how far away you are.  Once you get used to hotkeys and can ping menu's up and move around easily, some things you wish could be better like the sector maps on the universe view. ---That's all I've got\n\n----------------Graphics----------------\nDespite it being an older game, the graphics are good in my opinion.  I mean in most sectors it just a background and then elements like the gate and some stations, so I think they look pretty sharp.  Watch out for lag in the menu's if your cards underpowered.\n\n-----------------Combat------------------\nSome of the fights you can get into even early on are crazy, 'pew pew Whaaaaaaa!! barrel roll barrel roll barrel roll, 20 mins later *feel sick*, once you can afford slightly better than standard ships (OTAS) and fit some laser cannons it get's fun.  I can't comment on later game fights with M1's and huge fleets, I'm not there yet, but I assume multiply fun by factor of 10 or so.  It's really up to you how much you kit out a ship, you have to buy from stations things like shields and weapons.  Also upgrades for things like acceleration, cargo space and turn speed.  Plus, each ship contains a different conbination of all of these things so, combat itself depends on the choices you make plus your skill as a pilot, cool.\n\n-----------------Trading------------------\nYou could play this game forever and never fire a laser, I think.  Trading is a case of buying low and selling high, you find a station thats selling low and then you move around and sell it full price, repeat.  Find out who needs what, stations depend on resources in order to produce, increase cargo hold size to make best use of your finance and make sales there and back.  More advanced trading involved setting up ships using their onboard software (which you buy from stations) that do automatic trade runs, this I haven't done it.  Basically trade within the game get's a lot better once you get your jump drive, before that it's tedious and slow, which will put people off, so, get a jump drive.  Once you've travelled into a sector it appears on the map, so you can jump there using a couple energy cells make big sales, buy (*&^, jump somewhere else, bla bla.  One annoyance in the game is a certain lack of a lot of stuff, like as in 'sorry we're sold out' signs everywhere, sometime this can be improved by supplying what they need for resources, other times apparently it's just the game.\n\n-----------------Mods-------------------\nThe only mod's I've installed for this (there's tonns) some are too old and have broken links, but there's good UI mods that's make menu's etc prettier, less round and glossy, and also colour coding text makes it easier to differentiate between factions at a glance.  Also real stars and planet backgrounds, that's a must.\n\n\n---------------Conclusion-----------------\nSo yea, I don't know where I am with this now, just ranting really, if you like space (space! \0/) and games with a lot of freedom of movement, spreadsheets, data, tiny text, pew pew, then you'll no doubt enjoy X3.  For the price that this sells at your getting a ridiculous amount of game for the money, despite it's age.  I'll play this for another year or so yet, then look at the albion prelude expansion, then moving onto a newer X (bar the latest, I think).","November 2, 2015","true","105.3"," 72 of 79 people (91%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","91","72","79","12","0"

Yes, it is hard to learn to play it, there are so many different things you can do that you will basically use your entire keyboard to organize it all. But if you ever wanted to travel the stars, seek out distant planets, interact with different species, have a fleet of ships at your command, (ships that you yourself can fly) build stations in space, and/or build a galactic empire, hijack ships with trained marines, become a merchant/trader, a pirate, war hero, or simply not be known, watch entire fleets trading fire, use a turret while the ship attacks another, fire a barrage of missles at targets, destroy entire space stations, watch an assortment of people/NPCs live their lives all around you, fly thru asteroid fields, or just blow them up, then this is the game for you.\n\nThere is a lot I could say about this game, but in short, it's like nothing I have ever played, and I have been gaming for most of my life. I go on to speak about a few things on X3 Terran Conflict, but to be honest, there is just so much to say about this game, that it would take a heck of a lot of space. But here are a few bits, hope they help.\n\nNearly every ship in the game you yourself can pilot, from tiny fighters to large warships. You can travel the stars in on a large well defended ship, and then take out a fighter in your bay for a quick spin around the sector. The game itself is beautiful, from the stars to the ships down to the stations. It is all a sight to see.\n\nI've played many space games in my time, but none come close to X3. It does have missions you can take on but at your leisure, it is essentially an open ended game; do what you want, when you want. It will take time to learn everything, but little by little you will pick it all up. You will start slow, no money, a poor ship, and lost in the sea of space, but in no time, you will have the money to improve your ship and its armament, and ofcourse you could always come across a abandoned ship in space.\n\nThe sad thing about Terran Conflict is that, dog fights are out of the question. All ships have some or the best weapons in the game so you are stuck flying a larger ship with better defenses. Not that you can't use a fighter class, it's just that you will die often, so make sure to save often. For this reason I would recommend you start with X3 Reunion. While dog fights in Terran Conflict are almost suicide, in Reunion they are a must; while also being fun. I myself played Reunion first and learned the basics thru that game, and that made Terran Conflict much easier to learn. Terran Conflict is just a much faster paced game.\n\nI highly recommend this game to all space lovers, for I never felt closer to space than I have while playing this game. The mechanics are hard to learn but great once you get the hang of it. The visuals are a sight to see, and the ability to almost do anything you want is great. As I told a friend once, you could be flying to a far off place, while out of no where your trade ship is being attacked, while one of your stations is also being attacked, while your sector is being invaded, while your patrol fleet is being ambushed, all in a split second. It is truly something.\n\nThese few points and explanations do not do it justice, only playing it will.","May 9, 2015","true","37.7"," 51 of 54 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","51","54","4","0"

With more ships (including bombers, which are a powerful addition for anti-capital ship combat). But lets not forget the biggest deal of all. You can play as a Terran!  At long last we have seen our Terran brothers again, and can even play as them!\n\nPro:\n+Great Story! (You'll need context of the other games to fully understand it though)\n\n+Wide variety of mission types Combat missions alone include assassinations, defend a station, patrols, escorts, and even convoy hunting,  Trade missions have you supplying or delivering wares to stations, or buying used ships (can be a great way to turn a profit when you repair it yourself). Build missions to have you build stations for the universe (thats right, get PAID to build stations. Last type of missions are the "think" missions, which have you transporting passengers, scanning asteroids, returning stolen or abandoned ships, tracking ships, etc.\n\n+Randomly generated missions\n\n+Vast options of ships/equipment to choose from. (Scout ships, interceptors, heavy fighters, bombers, transport freighter normal/heavy/super freigther, "Transport Large" (capital ship sized transport ship), corvettes (like a small frigate), frigates, destroyers and carriers.\n\n+Player HQ (when unlocked) can reverse engineer ships (possibly jump beacons if you can get enough!) build ships, and house many ships,\n\n+Living breathing universe. All those ships you see flying somewhere are doing things around the universe. Be it supplying a station somewhere, patrolling the sectors for hostiles. (Dont worry, escorts and the various ships respawn over time ... stations on the other hand ... dont (exception being shipyards and equipment docks)\n\n+Reputation system for factions (how friendly/hostile they are to you, your clearence from shipyards, trading discounts, etc.)\n\n+Autopilot!. Game can run autonomously in trade/exploration/combat aspects. Just buy the ships, buy the ship software from military bases and equipment docks. And you can have self sufficient fleets that can even automatically do trading across the universe for you (with Trade software MK3).\n\n+Build your own stations. You can contribute to the universe and turn a decent profit when built on the right spots. Especially useful for obtaining some of those harder to obtain wares.\n\n+Piracy, you can steal from freighters, capture capital ships, and smuggle illegal goods accross sectors.\n\nCons:\n- Starts off a little slow. Because it takes a bit of time to work your way up (more from finances than from reputation; which is slightly hard to raise, easy to destroy).\n\n-A little buggy. two story missions can be rather difficult, and can break if you arent careful (Mission six of Terran Conflict can break, so make a special save before you start it). and Mission seven can be annoying because you have to try to board and steal a capital ship (but dont worry, after a time your allies do it for you). Other than that, its pretty much bug free!\n\n- Autopilot can be clunky sometimes.

Massive learning curve and a very tedious start make the game unbearable boring for the first several hours. If you happen to start near a nebula and you want to go anywhere, your screwed because you can't see anything outside of a tiny radious around you. The combat is boring and very finicky, and if bounty hunting your kills have a high chance of being stolen by a random passerby which make everything but a trader orientated start ridiculously hard.\n\nSome of the positives are the freedom it gives you, even if it is a bit much for a beginner. The variety is also a nice touch, many different ships from different civilizations. Being able to just trade, just bounty hunt, or be an imperialist are all right there. Much like a single-player EvE but without the overly aggresive die hards playing it.\n\nWould I recommend this to anyone I know or in general most people? No, but for some it would be something they love. That's what it seems like though, you either love or hate the game. The game design is amazing but immense and complicated, not for most.

However, I would NOT recommend it to people without lots of patience or that aren't willing to learn a lot to play this game more properly.\nTo those that are willing, this game has a lot of depth. At first, you start either as an Argon or Terran and, as you complete some of the game's "story" missions, you'll unlock different starts.\nThe default control bindings are also a mess, you will want to change some them. And SETA speed. You'll be using that thing more often than anything, so set it to 10x.\nFlying is pretty simple once you properly bind (de)acceleration. Auto-pilot helps a lot, but other times it is a freaking burden that will fly your ship on a collision course with something else.\nDogfights aren't entirely fun if you're trying to hunt down scout ships, M5, the fastest class. Most of your shots won't hit. And most ships are slow. As in, sometimes slower than sports cars. However, when you get to fight larger targets, you really feel the thrill of the fight. It's not as fun as Freelancer, but it can be fun.\n\nAfter saying so many things that would actually make one want to turn their back, why I still recommend it? Because it offers you the chance to control capital ships, direct trade and military fleets as big as your credits can buy (and use them to destroy nearly everything in every sector), reverse engineer some ship designs that you can't buy (like the Xenon ships) and create giant self-sustaining industrial complexes that keep the credits pumping into your account.\nAlso, there are mods. You want Star Trek ships? There are mods that add them. Star Wars? Same thing. Other sci fi shows? Probably there too.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/solocitizen/recommended/2820/","solocitizen","Solocitizen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/solocitizen/","70 products in account","So a friend watching me play this game totally engrossed asked me where the fun was, and I looked up from my laptop long enough to think about that question and realize that I didn't really know. Was the fun in the trading economic parts of the game? No, sending your trading convoys from system to system to try and hawk off those Teladi Sun Flowers is more tedious than "fun" by any conventional means. Was the fun in exploring the galaxy and flying from system to system? No, ships are too slow and most of the time you'll be flying to system on autopilot while your SETA (a device that speeds up gameplay) does all the work there. Is the fun in the combat? At least that's fun, right? I hate to break it to you, but the combat can get wearily repetative real quick, and the intense dog-fights of the early game disappear as soon as you get a corvette class ship.\nIn all honesty, I have no idea where the fun is in this game, but it's there, alright. It's gripping, frantic, and you'll be so invested in your little ships that you'll be crying at the screen once you see a Xenon Q drop into the sector and blow one of your trading ships back to whatever year this game was made in.\nThat said, this game is by far one of the most difficult that I have played in a while and I wouldn't recommend it to just anybody. X3 drops your right into a hostile universe of intergalatic trade and warfare with little explanation of what to do, how to do it, and very little to do anything with. How are you supposed to survive, let alone succeed in this universe? The same way you do in any capitalist society: pull yourself up by your ♥♥♥♥ing bootstraps you lazy, entitled, leech. The previous generations of spacefarers didn't have anything when they made a go at it so ♥♥♥♥ you for thinking you're going to get off so easily. (Said previous spacefarers also didn't have anywhere near as many challanges to face as you will, but just try explaining that to them).\nIn all seriousness though, newcomers will have a serious learning curve thrown at them and some unfortunate bugs to worry about. For example, X3 has one of the most realistic functioning economy's in any game, but it often works too well. GoD (don't ask me what that stands for) will spawn and remove factories based on supply and demand. Makes sense, right? Factories that move product obviously stay in business in the real world while those that don't get shut down. Where's the problem with that? Well, a few of the races don't HAVE the infrastructure to maintain a functioning economy because the devs didn't think it through enough and so the factories that produce the only compatible missiles and ammo for your ship might just one day disappear and leave you high and dry. Veteran players figured this out a long time ago and have their work arounds; new players, however, beware.\nIf you get this game, make sure to consult the forums for advice, tactics, and warnings (disappearing factories aren't the only bugs to be mindful of) from those more experienced capitalists.\nHave fun.","May 13, 2015","true","54.5"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","100","16","16","6","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shadow_Poultry/recommended/2820/","Shadow_Poultry","Shadow Poultry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shadow_Poultry/","140 products in account","X3: Terran Conflict is a massive game, which works both for and against it. If you invest enough time into this game you can create sprawling industrial complexes and an armada of warships. Unfortunately, after playing the game for a relatively brief amount of time I grew unable to care less about having an empire in the X3 universe. If I had to describe this game in a few words those words would be: monotonous, insipid, and glitchy.\n\nAs soon as I started playing the game my first mission was to go on patrol. I believe I had to patrol four or five times within the first five hours of the game. Patrolling missions mostly consist of floating around aimlessly and possibly blowing a few enemies up. There were also some combat missions, but I found those to be equally boring. To fight enemies you simply fly within their proximity and hold the right mouse button while aiming over a reticle. Combat could have benefitted immensely from flanking bonuses as well as bonuses for strategically targeting different ship components.\n\nThere are several other types of missions as well but they all primarily consisted of going from point A to point B and accomplishing eerily similar tasks. These shortcomings in mission and combat design could have been mitigated by the presence of interesting characters and an engaging story. Instead these shortcomings are amplified by a cast of annoying characters that spew forth inane drivel and a story that moves at a snail’s pace. The dialogue isn’t necessarily bad (or interesting) but the voiceover work is unbelievably annoying. Every character I encountered spoke as if they were poorly reading from a script, exhibiting inexplicable tonal shifts and awkward pauses.\n\nDespite all of the aforementioned flaws I still intended to continue playing this game. After getting a more complete sense of the games mechanics and contents this changed. To start doing anything really profitable in this game, such as starting a factory, a number of exceedingly expensive components are required. This wouldn’t really be a problem if acquiring credits were fun or enjoyable, but this is not the case.\n\nEvery aspect of this game demands that you waste your time to accomplish anything. Travel times are ridiculously high even when you use a time accelerator. Missions that award you anything more than a pittance are incredibly hard to find and are frequently completed by some other spacefarer before you even get half way to your destination. Additionally, as stated before, most missions just involve going from point A to point B and are typically monotonous.\n\nTo make things worse, the time accelerator is actually a ship component that needs to be bought. The ship you begin the game with will always have an accelerator, but several of the ships I acquired didn’t have that functionality immediately. Another thing I found to be quite annoying was the implementation of this time acceleration mechanic. Initializing time acceleration literally makes the game process two to ten times faster. This would probably be fine if the AI could handle it, but apparently it can’t. One of my AI ships smashed into a wall and exploded when I activated time acceleration, and many of the other ships in the area started acting nonsensically as well.\n\nThere are many other issues that I could address in more detail, but the critical flaw of this game for me is relatively simple. X3: Terran Conflict just isn’t fun to play. I really wanted to like X3: TC but I found that I was just forcing myself to play in the otiose hope that I might actually have fun playing this game. I’m sure someone would really enjoy this game and its wealth of content but that someone isn’t me. I simply can’t recommend X3: Terran Conflict to anyone based on my experience with it.\n\nEdit: I removed a rather hyperbolic statement from the last paragraph. I never said anything about the interesting ship, space station and alien designs either. The game has a unique aesthetic and the overall design of ships, infrastructure and organisms are pretty nice. That's also pretty much the only nice thing I have to say about this game though.","May 18, 2014","false","22.2"," 81 of 134 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","81","134","0","0"

One of the mane reasons why I chose to purchase X3 was because of the fact that you're given a choice to pilot virtualy every ship in the game, rather than being forced to stay confined to fighters (and maybe freighters if you're lucky *sarcasm). The game dose have a steep learning curve, but there are excelent sets of tutorials put out by CdrDrive, and TheXPGamers that make it very easy to get past. Once you get past the learning curve, the game is a tone of fun, but also very time consuming because of all the research you have to do when purchasing and outfitting a new ship; the reason for this is because ships sold on the market come only with basic systems (and sometimes none at all) so you'll usually find yourself traveling to different sectors for all the ship systems you need/want. The world itself is very expansive and you're able to do anything from being a trader, selling goods to the highest bidder, to a warlord, building a large fleet and capturing sectors. If you like openworld sandbox games that are extremely in-depth that take time to play I highly recomend X3: Terran Conflict. If you want to play a fast and easy game that has little to no learning curve, or you simply don't have the time for such a game, then you might just want to hold off on this game for now (but I still recomend that you at least try it).","May 4","true","163.8"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","14","15","2","0"

The GFX and quality is truly amazing and the controls are not bad.\n\nDespite trying to climb up the steep learning curve, this game should be awarded and listed as the best unoffical successor to Elite or Frontier: Elite II, due to the high similarities.\n\nAlso, my retail version of this game had some bugs since I first bought it when it was on the market since it's debut. Bare in mind it isn't uncommon that most Modern games around in this decade, can have a dodgy headstart. So please make sure you report any important bugs to EgoSoft Forums provided. They cannot help you if you cannot explain the bug assertively and clearly to them.\n\nAnd if you do decide to play a game like this, don't get committed to start a space campaign that you want to keep in the long term. Because EgoSoft made some changes back in X-Tension v1.4 near 2000 when my saves needed replaced for the TL class for X-Tension v2. And I won't be surprised that happened for X3TC when the patch reached to v3 onwards.\n\nOne very important note, if you use Money Cheat, Reputation Cheat or use Script Editor, you will no longer unlock achievements, so DON'T use any Cheats or Mods. Personally I use Money Cheat on this game predecessor as I really didn't want to waste time rebuilding my Space Empire and Reputation as that will take months - years even to complete this game. But this game is the best of all of the X-Series game so far, and it is more enhanced and easy-to-use in comparsion to X3: Reunion.\n\nSo my simple final advice is: No Money Cheat, no modifications and use the spoilers at your own risk for when you are totally stuck!","July 10, 2014","true","141.0"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

There's no getting around it.\n\nX3 has a REALLY steep learning curve, and it really is buried in menus. If you don't take the time to learn the game, you won't have fun with it. It's as simple as that. You can do an in-game tutorial, but it's nothing short of worthless. It'll teach you how to fly your spacecraft, but you can figure that out with the manual that you should read anyway.\n\nBut that being said... If you're willing to take the time to learn how to play, This is one of the best space games on Steam.

Later in the game, you end up building up a mighty empire, and at that point you end up spending much more time micro-managing shipments to and from your stations, maximizing production of goods without expending too much of your profit, and from there you spend almost all your time balls-deep in a couple dozen menus.\n\nI probably didn't make that sound very appealing, but that's because at face-value it really isn't. But there is something strangely captivating about the whole experience, if you can get into it. I spent about 5 and a half hours today flying from solar production plants to mining facilities, shuttling energy cells for maximum profit. That's basically all I did all day, and I didn't even realise how much time I had wasted. Your experience may vary, but... I recommend at least picking it up and trying it, if you've got some money to blow. You might end up getting a refund though, and if you do, try out something like Starpoint Gemini 2. It's a lot like X3, but it's much simpler, and much easier to get into.","January 28","true","19.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","11","11","5","0"

Distances get bigger, trade orders get larger, targets get bigger guns and escorts.\n\nBut, after that you can set up automated traders or stations to generate credits. While they're busy making money fly around the galaxy and discover new trade routes, hidden sectors and rare trade goods. Then buy a frigate, fit it out with some big guns and go shoot something. Collect some bounties, expand your empire.\nEach race manufactures its own ship for each class, with varying strengths.\nLow shields but fast - Split\nSlow with armour - Teladi\nReally good but compatible with only their races weapons - Terran\nCompletely useless but look pretty - Boron\n\nOn another note, the developers Egosoft have a good relationship with their community and have included some player created mods into official patches.\n\nTips\n-Learn how to use autopilot\n- Use 'J' to speed up the game while in autopilot\n-Aquire a jumpdrive ASAP, makes getting to known sectors an easy task.\n- Set up a few Universal Traders to generate income\n- Go view the forums at egosoft for some tutorials","July 18, 2015","true","119.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

I *really* did. Let me explain why.\n\nI'm a veteran video game space cadet. I played the original Elite and Wing Commander on Commodore 64, and lots like them, since. I've played EVE Online off-and-on since Trinity (~ 2007). I ***LOVE, LOVE, LOVE*** spaceflight games that are "sandbox-y" for almost as long as I've been playing video games, and that's been too long a period of time (I'm now 41).\n\nThe Egosoft team was obviously ambitious. And, in some core ways, they succeeded. But the whole thing ultimately feels rushed.\n\nIn the end... At minimum, there are five things keep me from recommending this game.\n\n(01) - There's no clearly-evident, gradual-slope difficulty ramp, and what you see is not always what you get. One minute, you're doing something that you percieve is very easy, is in fact very easy, and you are succeeding quite well... And the next minute, you're doing something that you percieve to be (very) easy, is in fact very difficult, and ends up being effectively suicidal as a consequence. One ends up having to revert to game saves frequently before gaining a good feel for that the *real* difficulty of various things are, as trial-and-error appears to be the only logical path towards mapping out a successful long-term course of action for oneself.\n\n(02) - The accelerated time mechanism... Isn't accellerated enough. 600% of real-time is the max; in fact, it should be variable, with max *at least* %1,000, given the distance between various objects of interest, and the max velocities of the majority of craft in the game (esp. in the early game). Expect to spend LOTS of time simply staring at your screen whilst you travel from place to place. For me... It got *really* old after a while. Asteroid mining in EVE Online came to mind - a great "second screen" experience whilst your primary focus is on something else (work-related?)... But boring-as-hell if you have nothing else to do at that time. Or, at least, it *would* be a great second-screen experience, if the next line-item wasn't true.\n\n(03) - The auto-pilot is borderline suicidal. It's certainly borderline schitzophrenic. At minimum, it's not consistently reliable for what one would expect to rely upon an autopilot for: performing the mundane, common tasks associated with piloting a craft, without harming the vehicle or its contents. Simply put... It's difficult, if not impossible, to "trust" the autopilot within confined, or crowded, space... Which means its use is circumstantial... Which erodes the value of such. (IMO, anyway.) It results in lots of time "babysitting" the craft when (IMO) one shouldn't have to. If this one thing were fixed... I would borderline-recommend this game for use as at least a "second screen" experience (as described above). But, as it presently stands, I would distrated too often by my "babysitting duties". :-(\n\n(04) - The tutorial sub-system is *far* from complete. I appreciate the fact that Egosoft respects their customer base enough to deliberately avoid "hand-holding them" through everything... And I actually *like* the idea, in concept, of forcing the player to learn the majority of the game through actual experience. But there are better ways to do the latter - EVE Online provides some excellent examples. For a game this complex... Just teaching them how to move around, and them leaving them to their own devices, with one having to traverse the majority of their local solar system in order to learn enough subsequent basics to gain an idea as to what their options are (much less decide upon a course of action in the direction they wish) is a bit ridiculous, IMO. It's as if the game's creators expected anyone buying the game to have prior experience with a variety of similar-genre games in the past, such that they would "just know" what their options are, thus lessening the tutorial/ training burden. It's pretty lame, in this respect.\n\n(05) There's no context-sensitive help to speak of (that I could see), beyond short descriptions of various items/ entities. I could forgive (04) if there was strong (05) present... But there isn't. I shouldn't feel obligated to alt-tab to/from my web browser to search the web for basic how-tos, as I play along, to make up for the lack of available in-game documentation.\n\nIn short... This game feels like it was the work of a small, highly-ambitious, highly-skilled development team... Who hit a budgetary/ deadline wall before this could be fully baked... And, like many rushed programming projects... The documentation is the first to be sacrificed at the altar of timelines and budget constraints.\n\nAgain... I would *really* like to recommend this game... But, as I've played it over the last few days... I just can't. And that makes me sad. :-(","December 15, 2014","false","7.6"," 55 of 97 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","55","97","3","5"

I'm about to correct it now. However, before going any further, I'll say that I still don't recommend this game.\n\nPros:\n- graphics\n- soundtrack\n\nCons:\n- story\n- gameplay\n- and everything else\n\nLong version:\nStory:\nX3 Terran Conflict is the first X3 game I've played. I don't have any experience with previous titles, but this doesn't seem to matter because there is hardly any story in this game or the series in general. I've been playing for several hours now and nothing really happened, let alone one Xenos attack. I'm patrolling sectors where nothing happens. So I decided to make use of that time and dock at stations to see what they are and what they offer. Maybe this was the devs' original intention, but if so, they could at least try and create a story that would actually teach me the mechanics of the game and make the gameplay interesting. I also found that whatever those stations offer, I don't have funds for it yet, so there is basically no sense in docking there anyway.\nActing and NPCs are just plain bad in this game. When my military commander talks like "Please, fly to Mars, and please, don't forget to upgrade your ship there and once you're finished, contact me again, please." I really can't believe he's my commander. Really, if this guy "pleases" me one more time I'm about to hit him. Perhaps he'll even thank me for that.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game's learning curve is bloody steep. The Flight School barelly covers the minimum basics for being able to move and docking at stations. After that they throw you into deep water to teach you swimming. There isn't a single mention about the SETA, for example, I found that thing after several hours of playing! Then there is the interface, which is far from being intuitive so I spent a lot of time just looking for things like mission logs etc. There is, of course, this 70 pages manual, that you'll probably HAVE TO read in order to be able to play at least partially efficiently. The autopilot is a joke, really, I don't understand why it's even there. It navigates your ship like a drunk fly and is capable of hitting nearby objects in the process (usually resulting in your death). Your manual ship navigation is quite ok, so that's one good thing. Only there is no ship to be seen, so you may feel like just floating in the universe, which is quite odd.\nAlso, I needed to pause the game, then I minimized it and when I put it back to fullscreen, it was unpaused and keyboard configuration was entirely broken.\n\nMissions:\nThis is really weird, it's like the game's missions contradict themselves. Several times I was given a mission that was impossible to complete for one or another reason. Like retrieving a ship in some time limit, but the ship was so far and so slow that it couldn't get back in time. After the limit expired, the ship was marked as stolen (so I'm a bad bad ship stealer now), I lost recognition and when I met the Police, they destroyed the ship on the spot (the Police are apparently real badasses in this game...). Other times the ship I was supposed to retrieve was occupied by another pilot (suprisingly enough, they weren't very fond of just handing over their ship). I tried threatening them, I even tried attacking them and they said they would rather die (so these guys are badasses too, it seems). I probably don't need to elaborate - I lost recognition and the mission failed (Yay!). Yet another mission was indicated as easy but I encountered some massive military-grade mega-ship there that I was supposed to destroy with my bare fists (or rather my little ship I started with) along with it's escort. Geuss what, I didn't. As a matter of fact, an entire sector was all but devastated. And yes, I lost recognition and the mission failed. Apparently it was all my fault. Sorry guys, lemme buy you a beer...\n\nGraphics and music:\nThe game's atmosphere is probably the only thing that's well made. The universe looks beautiful, the stations' desing is intriguing, background music is nice and usually doesn't bother you too much. So you can explore sectors just to stare at them if that's how you want to spend your time. I'm not sure it's enough for a game, though...\nAbout voice acting - don't even get me started, it's terrible. But since there's no subtitle option, you'll have to suffer it.\n\nLogic:\nIt's often missing. Why do I have to fly next to someone's ship just to be told to fly elsewhere? And why is an "Unknown sector" right in the middle of known sectors? Anybody has a brain here?\nAnd while we're at it - since when can you hear things in the universe? And since when can you hear lasers?\n\nCommunity:\nThis game has a very loyal fan base but I also find it to be quite hostile if you don't share their enthusiasm about the game. I wrote nothing but my honest experience here and many people already marked it as unhelpful. The best negative review right now only has 80%, the second one has 66%, that's ridiculous. Sometimes I think that this game's fans spend their spare time by listing through negative reviews and marking them as unhelpful. Only 2 people were able to intelligently react so far, which I find quite disappointing.\n\nOther:\nFrom manual it seems that this game's main strenght lies elsewhere than in it's story (or gameplay or logic or ... ). You can build factories, plants, entire sectors, create an empire and virtually achieve all that virtual stuff. However, you need funds to do that, so you must play the story to get at least some money to start with (1.000 is a laugh). Or play as a Humble Merchant (tried that, too), but then there doesn't seem to be any story whatsoever.\n\nSummary:\nWell, if you're really into storyless space "half games half sims", you'll probably be satisfied. Until personal spaceships are commercially available to everyone, this is probably one of the best experiences you can get (the universe is really huge). If you aren't, dont' waste your money here. Unless you can get it on a really big discount.\n\nWhy do I keep playing it then? Because I bought it. Might as well see if there is actually anything of interest in later parts of the game.\n\nEDIT: after more hours of playing and basically just flying from one place to another (takling to people who look and sound exactly the same or following painfully slow ships) this "easy" mission which is part of main storyline led me to a pirate base that I'm supposed to scan. I don't have a scanner, though. I was told "Follow the ship and if possible, scan it", now I have to scan an entire base, no "if possible" any longer. The base is protected by like 12 other ships that fire at me at the same time. Lasers everywhere. Survival time: 8 seconds. Turning off this ♥♥♥♥, finishing my review, uninstalling this litter for all eternity. I wasted 15,6 hours of my life. Nice work, Egosof, rot in game hell.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/heroyoojin/recommended/2820/","heroyoojin","Hero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/heroyoojin/","439 products in account","I wanted to like this game.  The game uses an open world with a very deep level of intricate trading to draw you in, but when you get there, you begin to notice a few annoying hampers to the fun.  1) Quests are given by NPCs.  The randomly generated quests are indicated by a small icon beside the station name.  Since more than one quest can be simultaneously given and these quests are divided into types which are represented by icons, you never get a correct indication of all available quests.  This is because only one icon will be displayed while multiple quests could be generated.  If on your computer you were trying to find out your Wi-Fi signal strength and all that was shown was a Sun Java update, you'd get the feeling of this annoyance.  2) Sometimes an open ended game is a good thing.  This is not one of those times.  Many of the given quests are unaccomplishable without prerequisite hardware, and this prerequisite hardware seems so vaguely indicated, so whisperingly hinted at, that it's not possible to know -- that multiple failures are the only way outside of research out of game to discover whether you'll be able to glean your needed profits from a quest or finish it at all.  This leads you to feel as though a quest is probably going to be a discouragement rather than a step towards your goals.  Again, I cannot overstate the literal impossibility of doing some of the quests.\n\nIf you can get over those qualms, and you might, you'll find an interestingly designed space-trader with a plethora of ships from drive-enabled space junk starters (we're talking PT boats here), to multiple gunned, AI piloted capitol ships which can be organized into floatillas, (we're talking the Pacific Fleet here).  Despite some unfortunately difficult hurdles, a very intelligent person with a lot of free time might have a chance at this, and the game itself has a lot of content and a lot of promise.\n\nI give it a 3/5 for Content, Concept, and Quality minus Ease and Clarity, but no reccomendation.\n\nCross platform works well, Mac and Windows.","October 29, 2014","false","72.0"," 43 of 77 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","43","77","0","0"

Yes, just like most of the other reviews I will say there is quite a bit to learn. I recommend looking at the guides avaliable (the X3 for Dummies guide helped me get a clue what was going on, while another guide taught me to salvage missles for early game income) the in-game "Flight School" isn't as helpful as i'm sure it was intended to be.\nYou start out at the very bottom of the bottom for ships and equipment and information on your surroundings which while for some this may be annoying, I personally found it makes progression feel that much more rewarding. Trading in that old Mercury for a Mistral Super Freighter was very sweet.\nThe music is rather mellow but fitting. Sound is decent, all the various beeps and zaps one would expect in a space sim. The voices are not terrible but not really very good either. Mostly you will hear the robotic female voice telling you the name of whatever you have just clicked on or various facts about said things, which is fine.\nI have not experienced a lot of the fight system, being a humble yet cautious trader leads to following a lot of fighting around but not actually participating in it. That said even the small skirmishes are impressive to behold, there are a lot of different colored lasers and many different types of missile weapons all with various uses and effects I am sure.\nThe only notably terrible thing in the game is the auto-pilot which will at times crash you directly into things such as Gate frames or other ships. This can lead to your instant death if you hit something large enough or fast enough or if you're unlucky enough to survive hitting a military ship, war with an entire race. Embrace the save scumming unless you want to end up with your new suped up Split Elephant ramming into a fleet of the Argon Police force just because you forgot to leave the sector before telling its auto-pilot to place that Cahoona Bakery near Argon Prime, now you're roughly 20+ million credits down and at war with your own people. Despite this if you're careful with your own ship and not present in a sector while giving commands to the AI, it's an easily dismissable downside.\nAll in all I would say this is a good game if you:\n1. Have a lot of time on your hands to play intense and involved space sims and enjoy doing so\n2. Are patient with learning new things\n3. Don't trust auto-pilots\n4.

This game has a tremendously huge learning curve. This learning curve makes the easier missions almost seem monotonous. However, after a few how-to videos on different ship classes and what some of the sub-systems do and how trading works, I found that this game becomes rather enjoyable. The graphics are rather nice and the dogfights can be rather intuitive, depending on what enemy ships the game decides to dish out on the missions making a player decide whether or not they are going fight or retreat. I must also say that some of the autopiloting scripts are also broken as I have had problems running into other ships while taxiing from one transorbital gate to another. The best feature I like about this titile is that it's pretty much play at your pace.

I have put in 100 plus hours and I barly got one of the cheapest M2's in the game and for those of you who don't know what an M2 is its basicly the factions strongest war ship and the argon titan that I have is very cheap.\n2. There are many ways to make money in this game from becoming a mining corporation, a trading corporation, and/or (Yes I did just say and/or are you interested yet) an assassin.\n3. Lastly most of the plots especially the hub which i'm working on are extremly difficult and cost 100's of millions of credits to finish giving you a good challange and even more of a reason to play longer.\n\nNow here are the Cons of the game.\nCons,\n1, Now this game has a freakin massive learning curve. It took me about 2 hours to even figure out what I was doing, and that my starting ship really sucked. If it wasn't for one of my friends I wouldn't have ever liked this game. If you don't know what your doing check the forums or ask a question there everyone there is very helpfull.\n2, Now this kind of collides with pro 3 because some of the mission do get a little tedius but when your combat rank goes up so does the difficulty. At the point i'm at i'm getting in awesome broadside battles with other capital ships and waging war on the xenon (a hostile robotic race bent on destroying all known life).\n3, I forgot to add this and it kind of combines with con 1 but this game is really does not explain anything to you. I had to restart my game because I started on a custom game and you can't do the plots in custom game.\n\nThank you for reading this review and at first you will probobly hate this game but just endure the starting parts and everything will eventually come together for the better.","September 11, 2014","true","186.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Patience is probably needed, and it's not going to be from the speed of the ship relative to the average distance to travel (there's time compression and jumpdrives for that).\nSurmounting this, you get a game with features analogous to ones in real-time strategies (e.g units, control groups, invading sectors) and empire building (e.g production, fleets, personnel), in addition to what's obvious: shooting, trading, objectives from NPCs in a toggle-able first/third person perspective viewing stunning scenery coupled with unfittingly reused NPC avatar assets from 2003.\n\nThe odd ding of the game is the UI and menu interaction (without community mods/scripts), and even for a game like this, there isn't the convenience of command queuing. It's usual to navigate sub-menus and sub-menus within sub-menus- making some functionality hard to find at first or tedious to navigate to. Another is how [player owned] AI ships can get that one surge of stupidity or suicidal tendency then bump into objects until they crash and die, or try to fly through a Xenon sector then die.\n\nThe main attraction of the game is in the freedom and possibilities in player defined goals.

I have searched and played a wide vareity of space strategy, arcade combat and simulator games over the past 20 years and X3 is by far one of the richest and well made games I have ever played to date. Its beautiful, ruthless and endlessly vast.\n\nTo start, I will say that this is a very deep and heavy space simulator. You will spend more time setting up keys and shortcuts aswell as getting used to the interface and HUD before actually trading and fighting. That being said, once you have your keys set up and got comfortable you can easily start highlighting other ships and taking on missions. Whether those are escort, enemy take out, trading, rescue, scouting...the list goes on or just plain messing around in space it will leave you busy not for hours, but days, months, even years.\n\nThe Terran story is the easiest to get into as you start at Uranus, neptune, pluto, mars and then out to the alien sectors. During those missions (3 main story missions or 2-3 hours into it) you start to get ships as gifts to either sell for money and then use to upgrade others given to you. This is a perfect example of how the game plays out, it takes a bit of time learning what to do and where to go but once you start chipping away at the surface you learn more and get more. The game snow balls the learning experience always teaching you something new once you get new ships or get to new areas but then opening up even more doors to things you did or didn't do before you can now do better or differently.\n\nAs it may take you a little while to learn the ropes, you start to realize if you want to avoid the main story entirely you can. You soon discover you can be a pirate and steal your own ships and make your own evil empire, be a master trader and send automated convoys throughout the 200+ sectors in the universe and have your own military escorts. Be your own military (well for the leading race you are with).\n\nGraphics! Oh my the Graphics. It was released in 2008 and this game has aged well! When it was first released it was a monster of a game to run on PCs. Even low graphic settings it looked good but required alot, but with todays tech for PCs 7 years later this game can be easily pushed to high on mid end gaming pcs and can be maxed effortlessly with your average PC for games today. And when it is its breatless. The detail and scope of the game is mammoth, everything is so complex and intricate. A small space station in the distance can become a hulking megafort. Docking alone is a treat as you see upclose the details and raw size of the game. A true work of digital engineering mastery!!!\n\nThe final conclusion is that it plays like anything you want it to be, even to go so far and say mid to late game it can be a strategy game in the same vein of civilisation, but at the drop of a dime become star wars and rock your world. I bought a few other games on ps4 recently and thought I would be playing those... yea forget those games.The gameplay, graphics, open world, the story, the polish and loving patches made to fix the bugs. It deserves a 10/10 and rightfully so.\n\nWarning : If you intend on flying small fighters all the time and have epic space dog fights then tune your mouse skills up or get a gamepad/ joystick. You can buy Autopilot upgrades for combat early on but anytime you are in a mid to heavy fighter and they are in a light scout fighter you will go in circles shooting like crazy if you don't have a joystick or have your mouse sensitivity maxed. You can fly classic without those too, you just switch alot between auto pilot and manual fire mode. All that being said, its minor and is for early game. Once you get given your first few ships, you can simply have them follow you and intercept anyone while you pick and chose your targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","January 15, 2015","true","60.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hydris/recommended/2820/","hydris","Hydris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hydris/","66 products in account","The kind of game that may require reading a manual initially- there isn't much guidance provided in the game past an optional tutorial segment and some missions (plot chains) have a 'be-ready-for-anything' deal.\n\nThere's a lot to familiarize with, and it's is not from the sheer difficulty of the game, but from the quantity of content to explore i.e the command softwares, ship equipment, weaponry, sector information (e.g supply and demand, production, wares), factories- the list goes on. Patience is probably needed, and it's not going to be from the speed of the ship relative to the average distance to travel (there's time compression and jumpdrives for that).\nSurmounting this, you get a game with features analogous to ones in real-time strategies (e.g units, control groups, invading sectors) and empire building (e.g production, fleets, personnel), in addition to what's obvious: shooting, trading, objectives from NPCs in a toggle-able first/third person perspective viewing stunning scenery coupled with unfittingly reused NPC avatar assets from 2003.\n\nThe odd ding of the game is the UI and menu interaction (without community mods/scripts), and even for a game like this, there isn't the convenience of command queuing. It's usual to navigate sub-menus and sub-menus within sub-menus- making some functionality hard to find at first or tedious to navigate to. Another is how [player owned] AI ships can get that one surge of stupidity or suicidal tendency then bump into objects until they crash and die, or try to fly through a Xenon sector then die.\n\nThe main attraction of the game is in the freedom and possibilities in player defined goals. Don't expect tense emotional moments, flashy cutscenes, or iconic characters with funny and quirky lines- is not part of what mostly goes (or what will ever go) on. Some of the plot lines available (9 in total) aren't so great with some missions including ~5 seconds long unskippable scenes (fortunately infrequent) that show redundant information that the HUD shows already, and [being told to] follow(ing) a ship flying at 56 m/s for a 60 km or so journey, though the end rewards can have a massive effect on the universe and what's available to the player.","February 27, 2014","true","356.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

After playing FTL for a bit i decided to give it another go.\n\nIts a very immersive sandbox game with alot of things to do. You can captain a huge capital ship and blow pirates and other factions to bits, or you can build stations and run the universe with your economy like a true capitalist. There are missions to do which can vary from blowing some guy up to building a station or even being a taxi.\n\nThe universe is fairly large with around 240+ sectors so theres alot to explore. Diffrent sectors belong to diffrent factions with have their own ships (I like argons ships) You can buy their ships once you have enough reputation with them. There can also be pirates which can be annoying early game but trust me. Its satisfying to assult their pirate base with 3 captial ships as revenge.\n\nIt can take a while to get into this game as it did with me, i just had to sit down and use google every time i needed help.

It took a huge effort by the community and devs to fix a great deal of issues at the start, but I've got to say this will remain in my favourite games list forever. Its a mindnumbingly difficult game to wrap your head around at first, but when you do you'll be rewarded with a damn good, persistent economic management sim alongside a beautiful space simulator (with plenty of dogfighting).\n\nIt took months (partially due to a break, and partially due to a missing save (my fault completely) to get myself up to the point I got my first Carrier-class ship, and it was a beautiful moment watching a full fighter wing swarm and destroy another capital. The best selling point being you can sit back in your mammoth of a ship, or join the fight in a fighter (and these can be anything from nippy scouts, to heavy damage-soakers (and that's still not mentioning the myriad of Escort-class ships that bridge the gap between fighters and capitals.) Basically, if it flies, you can fly it.\n\nIt is prohibitively slow at first, guides can help with this, and I seriously recommend modding in the late game, both for added features, and tweaking the game to suit you better (easier/harder combat, more enemy ships/greater frequency of huge ships) anyway I could go on, but I can guarantee if the above sounds like your sort of thing you'll get your money's worth and then some.","April 28, 2014","true","859.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Everything looks fantastic, especially with a certain mod installed that rebalances the entire game and adds a ton of stuff.\n\nThe sound is ... well, it's spacey.  The ships make cool ship sounds, the weapons sound good.. kinda like weapons.  The music I really love, ambient and beautiful, usualy.  But action packed when you stir ♥♥♥♥ up.\n\nThe gameplay is great - but do yourself a favor and install the mod I mention below, it adds a great deal of content and forces you to strategize a bit.. it makes the universe a lot more dangerous, too.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough.  It's not nearly as hard to get into as people make it sound.  They're just being complainy and have that disorder that is the reason why commercials and movies have to  flash to a different scene every 5 seconds and use bright colors to keep the viewers from wandering aimlessly away from the TV and off a cliff or something stupid like that without realizing what they're doing..\n\nYou know, that's goldfish level attention span.... just saying.  I guess what I mean is, they're only the big HALO and COD fans. And they suck, right?\n\nI installed the XRM mod... adds a whole lot more to an already massive game.  Very good.  Makes a lot more random and dangerous encounters with different factions. - I worked my way up till I hadl ike 9 trade ships and I did a few taxi missions and then i started buying fighters...  then I bought a couple of these little military transports (like a small carrier.. holds 4 ships and has a couple turrets... im no superpower ...yet) and I had the most awesome battle.\n\nI jumped into some sector because I wanted to buy a bunch of missiles for my fighters and I ran into 2 of these Xenon corvettes and a few fighter's with them.   It turned into a big flashy battle and I completely mopped the floor with the bastages.   Even though I didn't have anything as big as a corvette myself, I deployed all my fighters and got into my Eclipse prototype ship and shot them all down.  In the end, the fighter I was flying was the only one that got really badly damaged and I didn't even lose one ship...  a little repairing to do, but hey... that was one of the most badass video game moments I've had in a very long time.\n\nEven the early stages of my character where I was trading and playing the taxi driver (you can do anything you want... though) I was having a lot of fun.  I was looking for new sectors to trade in and new goods and I came across a sector called The Vault, and there was a Khaak destroyer and two frigates and they destroyed pretty much everything in the sector.. ultimately I had to run but I watched them take down wave after wave of defenses but they pretty much destroyed every station in that entire sector...  that = sweet.\n\nBuy this game... play this game...  it's so good I actually ♥♥♥♥ my pants, really.  And that's just when I think about playing it.. when I actually play... wow.   Do yourself a favor and download the amazing XRM mod, it adds so much depth and replayability, not that the game didn't already have this... but who doesn't like even more weapons, ships, customization, strategy and battles?  Pansies, that's who.  Are you a pansy?   Play the damn game.","January 6, 2014","true","538.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

No green slimes will be slain, though. In this game you'll be starting out in a modest little space fighter or freighter and working your way into power and prosperity through combat, trade, or a mix of the two (salvaging gear from the strife of others).\n\nWhile combat was fun, and shouldn't dissapoint anyone coming from the Freespace school of gaming, I found trading and fleet management to be the most enjoyable and challenging parts of the game. X3's logistics, economy, and trading mechanics are as complex as they are fun, and a wonderful reward for those willing to brave the learning curve.","June 30, 2012","true","19.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Once you actually get to do something.\nUnfortunately it also involves a lot of backtracking. During which you basically select your destination, hit "autopilot", hit "time-compression" and then still have to idly wait several minutes to get anywhere. After which you get to do something for 1 or 2 minutes until you backtrack to where you started.\n\nWhich is actually the one single reason why I can't really recommend the game.\nSeriously: I wouldn't even mind if they had built in an animation, showing the pilot leaning back, picking up a game of Sudoku and asking you if you want to actually play something to pass the time while you wait for your ship to reach the next sector. Or randomly show the pilot spilling coffee over the controls after which you have to rewire the control board before your oxygen runs out. Unfortunately they implemented neither of those options and just made a game with built-in coffee and bath-room breaks.\n\nHowever! If this is actually a non-issue for you. If you enjoy open world exploration games in space, you love figuring out complex game-mechanics, you don't mind spending app. 50-70% of your game-time (depending on how you play the game) in transit, can forgive a game some hickups here and there, don't mind if you have to repeatedly do similar actions over and over again to earn cash and you got tons of spare time to sink into X3, then by all means! Get this game! You can spend weeks - months even - of time playing! Slowly building your empire! If that's what you are looking for then just hit the "add to cart" button NOW! This game is for you!\n\nOtherwise: if you don't have much time to play. If you don't really like it when a "new" mission is giving you this strange deja vu feeling that you've done all this before. If you prefer a strong story and a more linear way of telling it. If you want the game to just cut straight to the chase instead of leaving you hanging in there. Then just skip X3 and look elsewhere. Because this game will feel unrewarding if all you can spare is an hour or two every once in a while.\n\nThus I think: X3 is a good game with a great and loyal fan-base.\nBut it just isn't equal loads of fun for everybody.","March 14, 2015","false","0.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The non-existent direction and structure didn't do it, Heck, for some reason I didn't even get this not-so-great tutorial that everyone bashes, and even not having a tutorial for a game with this massive of a learning curve didn't do it.\n\nBut the 6th time I tried to complete one simple, utterly banal follow mission, only to have the ship I was following follow ME instead (ruining the mission), or disappear into nothingness (ruining the mission), or jump through a gate (ruining the mission), I had that last straw pulled from my hands. Once you unlock the mysteries of trade that X3: Terran Conflict tries its best to make cumbersome and difficult, you are rewarded with tedious, laborious work that involves trying to figure out what goes where and who will buy what, and then when that is squared away, you will fight the navigation system and the touchy time dilation to speed up and automate this tedium as much as possible. And the notion of doing this hundreds of times seems like an unjust punishment of which I'm not sure I'm suffering for.\n\nI wanted to like this game so bad. The graphics are nice, the sound is nice, the immersion (with the absolutely necessary cockpit mods that never should have been excluded in the first place) is decent, but I cannot force myself to waste any more time on a game that does every single thing it can to frustrate, alienate, disappoint, confuse, and obfuscate every single aspect of the game that you try to engage.\n\nThe positive reviews are baffling.\n\n*Uninstalled*\n\nI just want a good space-sim. It's been a long dry spell and this game has not helped. Maybe once Elite: Dangerous is an actual finished game in 2-4 years, there will be something close.

The sense of scale in the game is incredible and so much better than something like Freelancer IMO, when you're right next to a massive planet it truly makes you feel tiny in comparison and from what I've seen the universe you can explore is gigantic.\n\nI tried to get into this game but failed. That God damn user interface... holy crap.\n\nUnfortunately the developers managed to design one of the worst user interfaces I've ever seen or had the displeasure of using, it's the dictionary definition of clunky, which is probably why they don't feature it in any of the game screenshots.\n\nYou can only have one of the plethora of menus open at any one time. You can't seem to have multiple windows open at once or drag them around so I can compare data side by side, I can't lock windows in place to always keep an eye on them... I mean ffs Transport Tycoon had this back in the 90s.\n\nFont size is really small, I must admit to not having the best eye sight any more but I found myself constantly having to lean forward to read some of the text. There is no option to scale the GUI or font size and since many menus are made unecessarily small when you hack the font size to be larger using a 3rd party tool it causes the text to overlap with each other.\n\nThey didn't bother having text fields to describe things like goods or weapons you buy, instead they have this obnoxious computer voice that will describe what you are clicking on every single time. Granted they do have an encyclopedia but again its another separate menu so you have to leave your current menu and go open that, which itself is found buried beneath like 3 sub menus.\n\nI currently have 3 freighters, a bunch of satellites and my scout ship and the property window is already looking like a total cluster ♥♥♥♥. I hate to think what it would be like with hundreds, good God.\n\nThe user interface is something I would expect from a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console port not a PC exclusive.","June 18, 2015","false","15.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, if you're somebody that doesn't have the patience to learn practically everything by yourself, I would stray away. I took on the infamous "learning curve" this game has and I'm glad I did. I didn't think learning a game could actually frustrate me, but when I did learn, I started to have a lot of fun. There are very few space sandbox games that let you have this amount of control.\n\nWhat little of a tutorial this game has makes up for it in variety and content. You can approach success in space by trading or by working for the military. You'll start out with a small spacecraft with hardly any weaponry or cargo space and are set in a galaxy with many avenues of approach. Your only obstacle is your ambition. 6 hours later of learning and I now have 3 trading ships in my fleet, including two extra large tankers which I use to transport energy cells from solar power facilities to space stations that need them. Almost every sector without a solar power facility needs these cells to operate and is a quick way to gain a fortune to expand your fleet and your success in being a merchant.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, you can also progress by working for the military or being a mercenary. The game starts you out with very little direction for this, but eventually you will find there is plenty of work to be done in the form of stations and military outposts looking for people to hire. Completing these jobs will earn you recoignition for your status as well as credits to spend on your ship or fleet.\n\nIn the end you don't have to do any of this, you are free to explore where ever you like as far as you like, attack anybody you want, trade with anybody you want, settle with any species you want. And I'm promised that's not the end of it. I'm very excited to really dig into this game on a day I don't have to work, I look forward to the expansions of everyones space empire, should they choose to purchase this game.","February 29","true","29.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, this game is an excercise in frustration for me.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I can understand why some people would really like it.\n\nI suppose, I'll do the typical pros versus cons style review and let you make your judgement.\n\nPros\nDepth:  This game has so much depth and a real sense of immersion.  With innumerable ways to play.\nCustomization:  Each ship's weapon loadout is customizable.\nExpansive:  Every system you enter is huge with many places to visit.  Players can even build their own space stations.\nCons\nThis game does not respect your time:  Every system takes 5-10m to cross, with little-to-no interaction.  When you die, you are sent all the way out to the main menu to reload your save game, instead of given the option in-game.  Docking with stations takes 5-10m.  In six hours of gameplay, I have made little progress in any of my endeavors.  And, the smallest inkling of satisfaction for the time invested.\nThe jump-drive is terrible:  This 'jump-drive,' accelerates time, but the ship must be on auto-pilot or it cannot make any maneuvers.\nIn-game options:  The in-game options reset themselves for every new game you start.\nLong, useless tutorial:  The tutorial alone requires approximately 20m to complete and only teaches you basic flight controls.  Leaving the player to 'experiment' to figure out everything else.\nEXTREMELY steep learning curve: In the six hours I have played of this game, I have made little progress in understanding the economy and I am still finding new ship controls.\nOverall, I'm glad I bought this game on sale instead of paying full price.

Any game with an instruction manual that is over 100 pages long is going to require some serious patience. I even found EvE-Online more accessible than X3TC. Some people will find these to be plus points but for those who want a game they can just pick up and play... buy something else. Don't listen to anyone who compares this to Freelancer (Freelance was much more of an arcade game), if you enjoyed Freelancer there is no guarantee you will enjoy this game.\n\n\nFirst I will list what I though were the good points :\n\n-Graphics are pretty good for a game of its age.\n-Reasonable sound with great music.\n-A HUGE universe to explore.\n-A plethora of different ships, space stations, weapons, ship equipment, etc. (the vast majority of which the player can own themselves).\n-A bustling trade universe with many resources and end products which the player can trade in.\n-Great sandbox feel to the game, you could play for hundreds of hours and build a huge trade empire or combat fleet without ever touching on a "Plot" mission.\n-A very helpful and dedicated fan base who are more than willing to help out new players (dont think i have ever seen the word "noob" on any forum/thread), there is a huge resource of info about the game on various websites/youtube and there is a large modding/scripting community.\n\n\nNow the not-so-good :\n\n-The game interface can be pretty cryptic and is not very intuitive at all. It took me a long time to figure it out (in fact I still dont think I have it figured out fully). A lot of the fans of the X series will praise the interface but I think they are comparing to previous X games (which must have had a truly aweful interface).\n-The AI can be pretty dumb, flying ships into stations or something simmilar. However i think this has been mostly sorted out in the later versions of the game.\n-Missions directives can sometimes be quite confusing and it is easilly possible for a player to accept a mission that they are vastly under-equiped for, which is just poor game design IMO.\n-Some of the plot mission requirements are absolutely insane and from what I have read, many players opt to mod the game to lower the requirements (because they really are that rediculous, requiring the player to amass huge amounts of resources) which feels a bit like cheating to me. But remember, you don't HAVE to do the plot (sandbox).\n-Very little in the way of in-game tutorials leaving the player to figure out most of it on their own. I for one, dont mind having to sift through the manual or read the wiki to figure stuff out, but for some this will be a deal-breaker.\n-The need to mod the game.... you really do have to. The vanilla game is sadly lacking in certain areas and without some of the mods the vanilla game feels like a beta.\n-The NPC voices are incredibly anoying!!!\n\nIn conclusion this is a game with huge potential so long as you are willing to put in hundreds of hours of gameplay (its like having a second job!!). It can be very rewarding and incredibly frustrating at the same time. The interface can be very irritating at times but if you can get to grips with it, there is a lot of enjoyment to be had. If you are looking at buying this game I would highly recommend having a look at the available mods and what they do BEFORE you start playing, because some of the mods require you to restart the game from the beginning before they will take effect.\n\nA vast, deep game with huge potential so long as you are willing to put in the time and can get past the steep learning curve.","May 5, 2014","true","206.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

X3 offers plenty of eye candy all around; its universe is a beautiful place. Follow the main story, or break away and come back to it as you please. Fully customize your starting ship(s) with upgrades to weapons, navigation, optics, etc. as you can afford them.  Work your way up in the corporate world by purchasing manufacturing spacestations, cargo vessels to transport goods and fighters to defend stations or escort vessels; build a financial empire, be your own Builderberg Group. Eventually, you can purchase an armada of capital ships and support vessels that you can use to supplement your firepower inside and outside of the main plot. You can helm any vehicle you purchase (provided you're close enough for a short spacewalk), and then, with upgradable ship computer software, issue orders to the rest of your fleets from the comfort of your captains seat. Maintain diplomacy with a variety of alien species, some of whom are mortal enemies, neutrals, allies, and still others who will eventually warm up to you after you invest some cash in their economies or shoot down enemies inside their sectors. Chilled out game-relaxing at times-that you can play with one hand on the mouse, or using the keyboard only, or both if you choose; it works however you want to play it.

In fact, every time I try to talk about it, I inevitably get round to a laundry-list of complaints, particularly about the interface or the AI. But paradoxically, not being sure why I love it is exactly the reason I love it, and the reason X3:TC is my single most-played game.\n\nI've never been a fan of the nostalgist's lament that games were better in the old days, but one thing that a lot of modern games are is predictable. Sure, I like them, but I know exactly why I like them, because they've been risk-aversely designed to be obviously enjoyable. X3:TC is enjoyable, but not obviously so, and in that, it recaptures some of the magic of an older generation of games.\n\nIf you like games where polish has been sacrificed for depth and vastness, and games where your own personal goals become more important than the embedded storyline, then definitely check out X3:TC.

There is a lot of depth and many different ships to fly within a huge open universe. That being said, there is a huge learning curve to go with the depth. I found myself browsing the web for answers on how to do even the simplest of things far more often than I would have liked.\n\nThe tutorial is...well, you on a search engine because the developer felt as though only people who had played their previous entries would be playing this game.\n\nThe graphics are nice but there is no getting out to explore planets or space stations. You are limited to being in or around a ship throughout the entire game. In fact, you will never be planetside at all.\n\nThe AI is horribly broken to the point that it could frustrate Ghandi, assuming that Ghandi would have been a video game nerd (I'm not sure he'd be a space sim fan if he was), which constantly gives you the ultimatum of either losing large amounts of money or reloading your previous save. Choosing either option causes you to feel as though you have recieved the raw end of the deal since you will never get back the time spent.\n\nIf you are not like Ghandi the space sim fan and prefer action to trade then you again shouldn't bother as you will indeed be bored. There is action but there is far more travel-time than action and when it does break out, the enemy A.I. is not very bright and the outcome is based on a numbers game (who has more firepower). I personally don't mind travel-time in a space sim game but I'm sure it is only because I like the genre and the exploration that comes with it as opposed to enjoying this particular franchise. Sadly, there is no cockpit view to enjoy the exploration with and the camera is rather limited as well. There is a couple of outside views available but one of those views cannot be used to navigate intuitively and the other view is a camera stuck directly behind your burners with no allowance for deviation so you cannot really see your ship anyhow. It's possible there is an option somewhere to move this camera but it seems that will be another research topic for when I play the game next...which would be whenever I'm bored of poking myself in the eye with a stick.","April 2, 2014","false","69.2"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","0"

Though Elite Dangerous has a very quirky and uneventful feel to it, it's just as linear as the newest addition to the series, giving much reason for bashing. Star citizen? Hype train with little to show. With almost 37 hours in the first week, I am happy to say that I have only barely scratched the surface! I would recommend this to anyone who would like to learn the X series, giving you the ability to jump in, and, (with the help of reading the controls menu, which seems like a foreign concept to some) I was able to learn my simple functions. Mechanics came logically afterwards, using a click on something before attempting to use corresponding hotkeys. Just don't forget to save!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombkraken/recommended/2820/","zombkraken","THE KRAKEN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombkraken/","453 products in account","X3: Terran Conflict put one, very important thing into perspective for me: space is astronomically huge. (Pun so very much intended.) It also taught me something very important: it takes way too damned long to fly anywhere in space. Let’s do this.\n\nI – Story [5/10]\n\nX3: Terran Conflict is an open world, simulation game from Egosoft. There are multiple stories for the player to choose from, but I will be dealing specifically with the first one, “Terran Defender”.\n\nThe player assumes the role of a Terran pilot who is out on a routine patrol in the solar system when, suddenly, they are summoned to aid in a battle at Neptune. Xenon pilots, using special beacons, were able to jump deep into the system; bypassing the usage of a jumpgate. During the ensuing chaos, a drone steals information from the Terran station at Neptune and delivers it to an Argon ship near Pluto. After the battle, the player is given the task of investigating the hostile activity of the Xenon, who are suspected to be under the influence of a hitherto unknown source.\n\nXenon and various pirate factions are discovered to be coordinating raids on ships for valuable resources. New ships begin to appear, which resemble Terraformers (Boron warships). The player assists in the delivery of Terraformer wreckage to Terran scientists who are able to deduce that the new ships are counterfeits based heavily upon commonwealth technology.\n\nRobert Pearle (an undercover Terran operative) has information concerning the origins of the new Terraformer ships, but he has been taken into custody by Argon forces. The player meets up with a fellow Terran agent, Patricia Heywood, and the two set off to rescue Pearle from the Argons. Following Pearle’s extraction, he accompanies the player on a mission to Split Space where it is rumored that the new Terraformers are being built. A mobile factory is discovered and taken by Terran forces and several Split scientists are taken prisoner as well. During interrogation, one of the scientists mentions the name Aldrin. (Aldrin was a Terran colony that was established long before the Terraformer War. The colonists at Aldrin managed to shut down their jumpgate and protect their Terraformers from the software error. Aldrin had been presumably lost during the war.)\n\nThe Terrans launch an offensive; reverse-engineering a jump beacon to get a fleet to Aldrin. A fleet of Xenon ships joins the battle against the Terrans, defending the Terraformers. A boarding party successfully takes control of the Terraformer CPU ship and the player is tasked with escorting Aldrin dignitaries to the Earth Torus, thereby opening Earth to the player.\n\nHad I played the previous games in the series (which I was unaware was a series until I started into this review) I probably would have enjoyed the story more than I did. That being said, the story was still okay (and very reminiscent of the opening mission of the first Mass Effect).\n\nII – UI [7/10]\n\nOnce I figured the user interface out (for the most part) it was a great system for the game. There was a “tutorial” (for lack of a better word), but it was not all encompassing. I felt a bit on my own to figure out the more advanced functions of the game. There was no minimap, which put quite a handicap on navigating. Aside from this though, the user interface, as I said, worked great for the game.\n\nIII – Gameplay [7/10]\n\nGameplay in X3:TC was really fun. Learning how the UI worked took some time, but the gameplay itself, was very unique. It is all first-person, whether you’re nestled safely inside your vessel or ejecting into the merciless void of space. It was a great way to explore and I sincerely hope we see things like this much more in games that are yet to be released.\n\nMy biggest complaint about the gameplay, however, is that (aside from combat) it is incredibly slow paced. If travel time had been done in relation to how long most people can stare into the abyss, it would have been okay. With the exception of the Grinch and sociopaths the world over, travel times can become extremely boring.\n\nIV – Content [10/10]\n\nThere is a truly massive amount of content in X3:TC. There is a huge universe to explore (and exploring it fully could very well take you the amount of time it would take a real astronaut), tons of missions, over 100 ships, ship classes, and weaponry. If you can stay interested long enough to discover it all, more power to you.\n\nV – Visual [7/10]\n\nThe graphics in X3:TC are decent. Taking into consideration that immense scale of the game, the graphics are about what you’d expect. While they’re not bad, they’re not outstanding.\n\nVI – Audio [5/10]\n\nI was rather unimpressed with the music of X3:TC. The soundtrack can often make or break a game (or salvage it from a gruesome end) but the music felt uninspired and pumped full of space-y noises. The sound effects weren’t bad and the voice acting was alright as well.\n\nVII – Overall [6.8/10]\n\nOverall, X3: Terran Conflict is an alright game. I didn’t like it as much as the rating I gave it, but, that’s that.","February 16, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You have to go several menus deep to do most things, and I find myself spending most of my time repeating the same series of clicks over and over again. Maybe there is a better way to do it, but the game gives you no help in finding out what that might be.\nI watched several videos, and read tutorials online before playing, and even then I was expecting a steep learning curve. Which is fine. That's not the issue, the issue is the poor design of the game. The game gives you the option to trade lots of different goods, but in reality you can only trade energy cells and ore at the start. The others never vary enough in price to make them worth trading. The "dynamic" trade system results in the AI traders contently supplying factories with everything they need so the price never changes. The result is far from dynamic.\nI found my greatest goal in the game was to get an automated trader so I wouldn't have to do the mind numbing, and painfully slow trading myself. You know something is wrong when the goal of playing a game is to make it so you don't have to play the game.\nAnother guide I read said you can build cash with missions. So I tried that. Except when you start out you can't do most missions. My slow trading ship can't do the trade missions fast enough. My discover can't haul enough, or fight well enough. A lot of missions require special equipment. So you fly around to 5 sectors looking for 1 mission you can actually do, then make a few thousand or tens of thousands or credits. I don't mind low rewards starting off, or hard to complete missions. The thing that gets me is having to tediously check 10-20 missions before you can find 1 you like. And it's not like you can fly into a sector and access all of the missions available in an quick, easy way either, no just get ready to mindlessly click through more menus.\nEven with all of that, the game has potential, and I can see where it could be fun once you get the hang of it. But if you don't have hours and hours to sink into a game, and a lot of patients to slog through the learning curve, you're going to get frustrated with this game. Maybe once you're an expert the game is fun enough that you can ignore the poor deign, but I can't.","June 14, 2015","false","12.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Thanks in advance.\n\nThere are some pro's in this game, i have to admit, but there are just too many cons that made me stop 'playing' this 'game' :\n\n1. everything takes way too much time, you can't accomplish anything in under 100 hours of gameplay; that is 2 or more whole WEEKS of worktime in your job! so i assume that most people who play this game are either\na) unemployed or\nb) have no real life (no offense) or\nc) are retired and have alot of time on their hands\n\n2. Interface is really bad, overly complicated and takes many hours to get used to; it feels like i am back to college trying to get a degree in spacetrading/spacenavigation... that is in my opinion not fun, but WORK, and i am here to have FUN, not work, because it's supposed to be a GAME, right?\n\n3. for a spacesim, it's more then unrealistic: you jump lightyears over lightyears in a matter of seconds, but the space you work in ones you arrive is about 120km in diameter only! makes no sense to me, sorry... i don't even want to talk about how long it takes to get from one gate to the next one, even with 6x timespeeds (called SETA here). oh and then you have to 'explore' those sectors first? haha... that would be ok if it's space that belongs to another race, but the terrans and argons should know from the start where their planets are right?\ni get it, all those things are there so it can keep you busy, 'exploring' """new""" planets... problem is, they are already there when you started the game, so it's only new to YOU, right? kills any immersion for me to be honest.\n\n4. Jumpdrives need energycells so you can use them... are we in the 21st century? never heared of any spacegame or sci-fi series before that you need a f... battery to use a jumpdrive device of some sort that brings you halfway across the universe... it this a TESLA Demeter or what? Don't tell me this game wants to be environment-friendly! LOL\n\n5. Boredom in space for me is this: for about 3 minutes of action you need hours of preparation sometimes, and the rewards you get are often far worse then the cost. It may be me, but that's just not fun, is it? It's like going 1 step forward and 2 steps back...\n\nOk there are mods out there that can solve many of those problems, BUT i just don't have the patience any more to deal with installing those mods and hope they work properly so you can finally, hopefully enjoy a game and hope that it doesn't crash BECAUSE of those mods! There is even a mod that removes the jumpdrives out of the fighters completely, so you can not use them anymore with them! REALLY?\n\nThis game has a huge fanbase (again i think it shows the actual unemployment rate we have in the country - j/k hehe), so there are a LOT of mods out there, but so many, it's\na) hard to find the latest version that works with your game and/or other mods\nb) the links to them don't work any more because they are too old and the files got removed\nc) the time you need to read through all these forum posts to find the things you are looking for.... you get the idea\n\nThere are so many more issues with this game that i could go on and on, but i don't want to waste any more of my time for that, so for players who consider buying this game, be warned: before you start to play this game do these things first:\n\na) quit your job\nb) end any existing relationships (if you had some before)\nc) get yourself a supply of food and water for several months so you don't have to leave your home EVER\nd) get yourself a supply of antidepressiva or other drugs that can keep you happy while reading all the information you can/must get about this game, because you will NEED to read alot before you start to understand what this game is all about (alcohol works too)\ne) be prepared to take a test after you read through all the material about this game (test will be playing the game itself)\nf) hide all items you could use to commit suizide ones you realise how much time you wasted for nothing\ng) find the uninstall button\n\nGood thing i bought this whole X-game stuff on sale for like 14 bucks, so it's not too big of a loss to me financially... i just want my wasted time back please ;-)","March 10","false","3.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","1","3","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drhuh/recommended/2820/","drhuh","Dies-A-Lot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drhuh/","147 products in account","I've now played enough to know that although this game is better than X3:Reunion, the interface is still poorly designed and they've made it even more annoying, hard as that may be to believe.\nSo it's still a game for people who have a lot of patience, who don't mind doing a lot of external research about things that should be in-game, and are satisfied playing poorly designed games with lousy user interfaces that go out of their way to waste the gamer's time.\n\nThe good:\nMuch better than X3:Reunion. A lot of the issues with that game were resolved here.\n\nThe bad:\nAutopilot. At least in X3:Reunion is worked. Here, it doesn't. Which means that as you wait for your ship to crawl across the screen, even with a 10x speed-up (assuming you have it installed on a ship - WHY would it not be part of the game rather than having to be installed on each and every ship??), you can't trust the autopilot to do it right. At least in X3:Reunion I could read a book while waiting. With X3:Terran Conflict, you have to babysit the bloody thing all the time. So not only do they waste my time, they've made it so that I can't do anything ELSE while they're wasting it.\n\nThe more bad:\nflight mechanics. The usual rant about THIS IS SPACE DARNIT!  It's not "3D cars in mud". If I stop my engine, I shouldn't just stop dead. I shouldn't have to loop around to get at someone behind me, I should just be able to kill my engine and turn around, still moving in the same direction I was moving in earlier. I'll put up with a lot of "let's play fast and loose with reality" for a game, but that one issue with space games is something I'll never accept. Freelancer got it right. So far I've not found another that has done so.\n\nThe ugly:\nNothing major so far. However, the game seems to revel in wasting the time of the player.  Where "waste of time" involves making me spend real, irreplaceable time doing things that end up having zero impact in the game, either because you have to reload or just accept that you've just spent the last 20 minutes for nothing. Over and over again.\n\nExamples:\n-- Still incredibly annoying, especially early game, as they make you pay (a lot) for the ability to save without docking to a station. This means that, early game, when you're weakest, you're having to start from much further back JUST as you thought you'd finished.  Once you can afford the "save any time" it gets easier. Until then, expect to be doing a lot of swearing. Or a lot of docking and saving, which is a massive time waster, especially on longer "timed" missions.\n\n-- There are a lot more locals than in X3:Reunion, which means that when you take on a mission that requires you to fight someone else, more than half the time someone else will kill them for you, which wastes your time because they only count the LAST shot, not the total damage you did. So you bring then down to near zero and some local asshat pots the final shot in for you, aborting the mission and wasting all the time you spent doing it so far.\n\n-- The autopilot in X3:Reunion only killed me once. That has changed in X3:TC, and the autopilot now will regulary attempt to ram you through a solid surface. Since ships that can take large amounts of weapons damage disintegrate at the slightest bump in this game, this, again, wastes time.\n\n-- Don't bother with "covert missions". They seem to be bugged. No matter what distance you follow (5/10/15/20/25) you'll either be too close, or you'll lose them. Another waste of time.\n\n\nConclusion:\nWaste of time, highly annoying, and just too many issues for me to be able to kick back and enjoy it. Still looking for a decent "space sim" game in the Freelancer model. Still waiting.","March 12","false","15.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"The blabla meat steak is a nutrishious".\nTo make things worse, you can disable all voice or none.\nHad I played this game any longer, I would have gone mad and started hearing those voices in my head...\n\nNext thing is the interface - it's not bad per se, it's just a bit confusing at first (took me about an hour to learn how to pilot the ship as all the controls are described in relation to joystick or a pad - but playing it with mouse and keyboard is actually good, but takes time getting used to it.\n\nNewbie friendly? Nope. Here, pick a starting game - we won't tell you what which one exactly gives so have fun guessing.I picked the humble merchant and from what I read online it is the best start.\n\nThe game takes ages to start - for hours you just fly from one station to another buying and selling - looks like a wasted time to me. If you are a fighter pilot who just rushes from place to place to shoot things it's probably fun, but if you visit the same station every 10 or so minutes... "The asteroid mining facility" Aaagh, the voices returned!\n\nI'll probably grind it some more and se if I can get a decent profit to build up a small cargo fleet and set it to be automatic so that I could focus on other things, but so far, the voices alone are a reason to avoid this game.\n\nDid I mention the voices?\n\n\nEDIT - before someone rages - I disabled the voices - all of them, but it's removing the useful announcements as well as the info spam","March 13, 2015","false","115.1"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","44","7","16","4","0"

However, the game primarily focuses on movement. It takes too long to get anywhere. There are other games similar to this out there that allow you to jump drive to places. This one sort of does  but it takes fuel and so you cant jump as often.\n\nStill, I would be willing to forgive it if only there werent so many bugs. Also, the fact that there are tons of missions that require certain stuff to complete but nowhere does it even hint to it will cause a lot of FAILED missions.\n\nBasically you start this game as a failure in everything and still I was willing to keep trying.

I'm more used to W and S being go and stop/reverse, but instead it's Z and X that does that (or mouse wheel).  That wouldn't be the biggest issue though, as X Rebirth is the same way but, I can actually play it without that many problems and seems to be a much better game.  I guess this game, just seems to be too slow for me, oldish style graphics and everything is scaled badly.  You've got this tiny tiny mini itty bitty hole for docking which makes you feel like a peanut compared to the station.  Everything seems to take ages to get past even with time warp making you feel even smaller than a peanut flying past the station.

Even in larger sectors with many stations things are choppy to begin with.\nMissions are often unclear, boring & take very long periods of time to complete so you will need loads of patience.\n\nThe economy is largely broken, your ai ships will fly into station often if you are in the same region of space and there is a ton of menus to navigate to do ANYTHING.

I am a very experienced strategy gamer though with lot's of patience but this game just wasted all potential to drag me into a exciting scenario.\n\nI do not recommend this game mainly because of bad quest-system,terrible AI (especially terrible friendly AI. In 2 hours of gaming I died thrice to friendly AI-bugs.) and messed up saving system.\n\nFirst things first: Yes the setting is great but you will get used it very fast and it becomes boring. The background color changes but still design is too similar. 3-4 similar buildings and a few portals. They could have made it more interesting by letting us explore stations but you just dock to it and can talk to others, trade or save there without exiting your ship.\n\nFurther, I don't like that you have to dock to a base to save ... you can accept quests without entering, you can talk to anyone in there without entering, why should I waste time for slowly approaching the base, with that very little entry just to save and trade?\nQuests are horrible for beginners, really. There is no tutorial (controls need some time to be precisive), you can accept quests you can't fullfill by any chance and are totally random. I became very angry, when I should retrieve a stolen ship in Uranus and somehow (although I started immediately) found it 9 portals further.(wtf!) That means 15 Mins of travelling for a very low amount of credits. Also the AI does everything to let you not survive. I retrieved an abandoned ship and told it to follow me but it did not follow me into the base where I should deliver it. So I parked right next to it and took it's controls. Then I told my main ship to follow the retrieved ship and it killed me by ramming it over and over while I was standing still. (wtf!)\nI also miss a fast travel system but maybe I am just to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to find it, there is nothing like an ingame help.\nSo sum-up:\nBad experience with q-design, weird autopilot and AI in general, save game design, distances led to a 2 hour rage-quit of a strategy veteran.

That of course is wrong. Skyrim is long. This game IS SLOW.\nThe game like many other space games fail on one simple thing; Travel time. Due to this, you spend about 90% of your time traveling from destination X to Y to Z. And in this game it does little to take away that factor. You may as well be watching a screen saver.\n\nYou cannot save the game until you are docked. Which only reduces yet again the pace of the game. If you dont save your game, you littlerly have to start again if/when you die. This means, yes, more traveling and doing the same ♥♥♥♥ you just did an hour ago. (Oh and docking aint fun in this game, there is no "click and dock" you have to either wait for the slow ♥♥♥♥ autopilot or manually dock yourself)\n\nThe game is not vast despite what you might hear. You go from sector to sector via warp gates. It's just a load of instances linked together. Oh and you cannot interact with planets in any way. They are just background art.\n\nThe controls, camera and UI are very basic. Giving commands to your other ships is executed poorly. You can give limited quick commands when targeting other ships (Or rather I should say command) which is attack. Thats it. The autopilot is also buggy, a lot of the time it will just throw you about makiing you puke from motion sickness.\n\nSome other things that don't make much sense: its cheaper to buy a new ship than to repair the one you have (And yes ships cost A LOT). Misions are completely randomized meaning that you wont be able to do like 90% of them near the start of your game. They are also unremarkable from what I've seen; "Do this and get credits" everytime.\n\nGlad I tried this game on free weakend. I won't be buying it and will not recomend it to anyone, one of the most boring and unbalanced space games I have played to date.","March 13, 2015","false","10.9"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","1","6","0","0"

Flight school was simple enough with a custom character (none of the premade campaigns looked that appealing.) Exploring the gates was simple enough. Encountered graphics glitches when I entered a new race's core world area. Nothing really to do with this character. Tried trading but whatever I picked up wasn't selling for any different of a price at the next 4+ depots I visited. No combat encounters. Bored.\n\nOkay, tried again. This time picked up one of the premade characters, figuring it would have more drama. Much nicer ship, faster. No prompts for any type of plot other than the flight instructor guy again. There were some hostile targets, so, I commed them and asked them to give up their cargo. They refused. I shot them. Then the police shot me. Game over. Bleh.

Waste of money and time. Spend the extra on Elite Dangerous which is much more approachable than this nonsense. You have to literally spend hours flying around different zones in order to find and map out the various asteroids, stations, production facilities etc, and that is even before you start to pick up missions or try your hand at trading. It comes to something where one of the main things you use in this game is something to accelerate the gameplay, that alone says enough. If you are looking for a space game where you can basically go and do whatever you fancy, be it, trading, hunting down pirates, being a pirate and so on then Elite Dangerous is where it's at.

Where do I begin, where is or was the story line?  Guess I missed that to.   Well if your looking for a game similar to rebel galaxy, freelancer or starlancer, x3 isn't it.  Maybe its me, but its all wrong, botched!  Being a merchant isn't worth bothering with when your only options are trade or barter.  Couldn't figure out how to buy or sell, cant make credits shipping goods around, have to trade or barter with other merchants to make some kind of credits, then again I couldn't figure out if your payed in creds or your recieving more useless crap.  Merchant ships don't have any weapons, or any I could figure out or find as i went through the controls.  An unarmed merchant is a dead merchant!  Graphics are horrible.  Its likely due to the fact that I haven't played alot of the older games lately, but ego soft could have done better.  I tried the terran pilot, that was just as bad if not worse, tedious and time consuming, this is how i started my game.  Go here, shoot this, scan that, blow that up, head back through the gate to someones ♥♥♥♥ and patrol.  Patrol for what?!  I never got paid, there was no indicator i was even looking for anything or something new was added to my mission log.(confused and flustrated look.)  Ok, so I'm not good at this game, went right over my head?  I had no clue how to play this game before I bought it and I still have absolutely no clue how to play it after I bought it.\nAnother problem is this game was designed to be played with a game pad.  Due to physical limitations, I can't use a game pad.  Doesn't work well with a mouse and keyboard, well it didn't for me, not sure about others.

Combat controls feel disconnected and arbitrary and the intensely click-menu-based play system does not appeal to me. It comes across like an extremely stripped back version of some parts of EvE with all the tedious, boring bits and none of the good bits.... I love space games and have hundreds hanging on Star Citizen; was just playing this to pass the time but it's really a disappointment. A lot of reviewers fixate on the 'steep learning curve'; which I was looking forward to but it doesn't seem so much a learning curve to me as working out how to make the poorly designed UI bearable/usable. Perhaps it was ahead of it's time, and the designers had not figured out a way to make all their ideas practical? Another thing I thought was very bizarre about this game is that it has a lot of 'ship software' which doesn't really do anything - the AI is either poorly written, or overcompensated with errors to 'mimic' something....? The gamebreaker for me is that the game largely consists of travelling through space without doing anything - even with SETA on, you just spend a lot of time sitting in front of your computer waiting.... like watching a long loading screen. That is very boring to me and I don't really understand players who try and justify that. It can be designed away with by the developer being creative. Some things don't need to be simulated; like the waiting....\n\nAnother amusing thing to me is that people have said that this is a good game compared to Rebirth. That must make Rebirth one of the worst games ever made in the history of computer gaming given how dull this supposedly 'vastly superior' version is! All in all, I should have just thrown the $20 I wasted on this at Star Citizen.","December 27, 2013","false","5.3"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","4"

Then this is the game for you.\n\nThis game could obviously have been a great hit, however for me the initial pacing was so slow that I simply lost the will to go on. The UI offers an insight into what could be complex and rewarding gameplay but for me it has to be fun; something, sadly, this game isn't. I played through the flight tutorial, the fist combat encounter and the final nail in the coffin a "patrol" mission.\n\nIt was the "patrol" mission that killed the game for me. After ten minutes of flying around as my brain cells committed suicide I finally saw my adversary. After using the games fast travel to traverse 50kms to engage him, ( there's something about having the ability to jump between planets in seconds but taking FOREVER to cross trivial distances like this is a bit odd) once in range we proceeded to engage in a spectacular dog fight i.e. we flew at each other head on, passed by without managing to hit each other, swung around and tried again. And again. And again... I was able to stop my ship completely and slowly navigate through the menus looking for tips. I briefly tabed out to visit the oracle that is Google. When I got back from making a cup of tea I noticed my shields had been knocked down to about 25%.\n\nI quit the game and promptly uninstalled it. I'm sorry, I tried but this is just not for me. I like my games to be engaging and challenging but they have to be enjoyable above all else.\n\nSpace games I'd suggest instead would be Kerbal Space Program, Space Engineers or Endless Space.","October 29, 2014","false","2.5"," 7 of 27 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","7","27","0","0"

I bought this game knowing it will likely be as buggy as X2 was, and am happily surprised.  It's not what I expected, by any means.\n\nFirstly, the bugs I've noticed so far are minor, not game-ending.  The game is also incredibly deep.  It has two main roles that you can go with, combat and trade.  There's plenty of pirates who take specific targets, and Xenon who just kill anything they find.  It's not over-whelming though if you go with trade, it gives it a fun, easy challenge.  As for combat, wow, just wow.  There are all sorts of ships, from mobile mining bases that you can setup smaller ships to gather astroid stuff, large freighters, fully automated sector/universe trade ships, corvettes that will blow away smaller fighter ships like they're nothing, and even larger frigates that I haven't had the chance to play yet.  The larger ships, called capital ships, can even be boarded and taken over by marines.  It's pretty deep.\n\nThe voice acting is weak, the story-line is pretty bad as well.  The best I can tell the voice actors used for the plot do not speak english fluently, the conversation seems awkward to say the least.  The main plot of the game is quite optional, so if you prefer, you can skip it.  I think it's best to skip it until you know how to fight, trade, have a couple ships with trade software 3, and maybe have built a mine or two for extra income.  Save often, you'll be very frustrated when a scout mission turns into a combat situation as you arrive 30 minutes into the mission.  There's also missions you can take from other ships and stations, they pay very well and some are rather easy.\n\nOverall, to get into this game you'll need patience.  I think the graphics are about average, nothing very special but not pixelated either.  The flow of the game is rather good, always something seeming to change subtly behind the scenes.  The sound track is pretty bad as far as the music.  Honestly I don't know about the firing sounds and such, I tend to make my own beeping noises and pshwpshw sounds and I blow things up.  Usually by the time I hit my finale of noises I get to hear the screams of a boron pilot in the background.  Again my only real complaint is the optional story-line.\n\nOverall Rating:  7/10.","June 2, 2014","true","110.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is no in game help / hint to guide you on this one. I only found out because eventually I looked on the wiki to see how to start the main quest line.\n\nI clocked up around 50 hours of game play before I even knew how or where to start the main quest line, and I only found that out from a wiki. Just pause on that one for a second and try and think of any other game that happens.\n\nThe game will happily offer you missions you can't complete because you don't have the equipment for them. Occasionally you don't find out you don't have the right equipment until you've reached the end of the mission, at which point you may as well load the last saved game and try something else. If you just followed someone across many sectors at <100m/s to find that out .. you may not want to play x3 for a few days.\n\nThe auto-pilot is a little derpy. It's not too bad in the smaller station systems, but probably can and will kill you trying to get around the massive Terran stations. In fact the massive Terran stations are so big (and the auto-pilot so derpy) that I've managed to entirely miss combat scenarios because by the time my ship had got around the space station, they'd all been shot down. It takes that long.\n\nIn most start scenarios, you start in a pitifully underpowered ship. It's so bad that to begin with, even completing the easiest combat missions is tricky, and you can ignore 99% of the other missions because you don't have life support cargo or the money needed to do them. I can see that aspect putting a lot of people off. The beginning is just a horrible grind with none of the upgrades to make it more bearable, and not enough cargo space or cash to make trading profitable.\n\nSo what do you do? Go wiki hunting. Find some abandoned ships, get them, sell or equip them, and begin to get a slight grip on the game. Noteworthy: This is a game you will almost certainly give up on if you don't read the wiki, and if you consider grabbing a few abandoned ships via the wiki as cheating .. then you will probably give up if you don't cheat.\n\nIf you ignore all that, there is a vast, complex universe out there waiting for you to spend hours and hours carefully constructing your own empire and fleets of ships. That's your basic deal with this game. Flawed & slow vs. a lot of potential for detailed (slow) space empire building.\n\nI'm not sure if I like it or not, but I do load it up from time to time and get a little further.\n\nNote: My hours look low on Steam for this game, because I don't run Steam to play it.","December 18, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is an extremely slow burner and will take a hundred or more hours before the real fun starts. But there are various problems. For starter, the AI is extremely poor, as automated ships will destroy themselves  by crashing into a station or an asteroid because pathfinding is too hard for them. Fleet control is poor, so much so that you would really rather simply pilot your own ship and do most of the fighting yourself (this is not Homeworld or Sins of a Solar Empire). The method of organizing fleets is clunky and stale and trying to get a fleet through a gate will end in heavy casualties crashing into each other. Physics is also a problem. Tutorials are left wanting and presentation of the game is poor, as it is mostly buried in menus and submenus. Voice acting is downright atrociouss. Graphics are very dated. The plot missions will take even more time. If after all this, you still want a good space simulator with the ability to craft your own empire then this game is for you.

It has depth and a variety of different playstyles that you can adopt that few games I can think of have these days; a true PC game (with rebindable keys, FOV slider and all that... sadly though it's single threaded.) Flight mechanics are not newtonian, which for me is a big plus, and it still looks good today despite it's age - even better with some of the huge library of mods available (some like the XTC mod wholly change the game universe.)\n\nNow I have a habit of liking games that few other people do, and this one is no exception. Back in the day that this was released, it was a 7/10 game and it still is even in my own biased opinion. However this game has that special something that many games these days lack (no I'm not saying that)... unfortunately it also has a rather steep learning curve, a useless tutorial and a UI that takes a lot of patience to get to grips with. It's a little too easy if played with the mouse too imo; I prefer using a joystick and keyboard. There's something of a roguelike mode too which I've found really addictive, but it's only worthwhile if you have a very stable rig and net connection.\n\nThe rolling demo is quite a nice thing to have for benchmarking - http://www.egosoft.com/download/x3tc/demos_en.php","November 27, 2013","true","528.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a sandbox the game is great and there is a lot to it. However there is a large downside that is an unavoidable price of this immersion -- the learning curve is precipitously steep.\n\nAs with many things in life, "good things come to those who wait":\n\nThe patient should be prepared to spend a lot of time researching on the Egosoft forums for advice and assistance on how to perform what should be simple tasks. Alternatively masochists such as myself can dive in and work things out themselves the hard way, which is rewarding, but painfully slow. Those seeking instant gratification or pew-pew action need not apply.\n\nI have been playing this game on and off for nearly a decade now, and probably would have spent more time playing it were it not for Eve. To be fair Eve and X are not directly comparable genres, but both fit the mould of a space-themed game that will yield large economic rewards to those that are prepared to invest a large amount of time. I would describe X as the more 'casual' of the two games as it is single player and therefore the economy does not respond to human factors, which makes it somewhat more predictable.\n\nOne final thought. The plot and missions are weak, and almost a sideshow. This potentially poses the question, "what is the goal of the game?" To answer that I would simply borrow the answer that the explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes gave to a journalist when asked, "Why explore?" ...

The gameplay is whatever you want it to be. You start off as either a merchant or mercenary, and decide what to do from there. The most impressive thing about X3 is scalability. I don't know of an example that compares to X3: Terran Conflict or Albion Prelude. There is no endgame, as you can grow yourself out to whatever lengths you like. Mods also make this game infinitely better - Terran Conflict allows for the XTM 2.0 mod, which doubles the amount of area in-game, as well as the number of spacecraft, weapons, and opportunities.\n\nThe battles in the game can go from tedious to downright impressive. The largest engagement I've been a part of was a 3-way battle between Xenon, Argon, and my own mercenary squad. Approximately 500 ships were engaged in real time, spanning from scout based fighters to massive carriers and battleships - all resolving itself in real time. No other game, no matter its pitch, has managed to do what X3: TC has done in a single player game. Given the price, it's worth a try if for nothing else than  seeing how much it can remind you of Privateer or the old Tie Fighter games. At best, it'll consume hundreds of hours while you build a galaxy-spanning trillion-credit empire with your own starship factories.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cecilkorik/recommended/2820/","cecilkorik","cecilkorik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cecilkorik/","358 products in account","Truly a diamond in the rough, this game was my own personally much delayed introduction to the X series. X3TC is now among my favourite games ever, and it is as of this writing my most-played game on Steam. It's a space trading/shooting/exploration/storyline sandbox at its core, like many other great games before it, but simply leaving it at that is not fair, because it smashes its way out of that mold and into something vastly more interesting.\n\nA key element is its emphasis on starting and growing a largely autonomous fleet above and beyond your own personal ship. What starts out as little more than having a second ship you can give remote commands to fly to various stations for purposes as basic as checking the prices there, will eventually grow into configuring a completely unattended merchant fleet of small freighters buying and selling commodities automatically.  But trading alone can only earn you so much, the game lets you take it to the next level with construction of factories, stations, and starbases and static defensive emplacements. Later still you may end up with defensive battlegroups patrolling sectors where you have assets, groups of combat carriers with huge wings of fighters and other huge capital ships and smaller escorts to protect them. It opens up a wide array of gameplay possibilities and late game can become more like a Space 4X RTS where you control a sprawling manufacturing and military empire as you vie for economic and sometimes violent dominance with rival factions. But it is ultimately your own sandbox, so this is only one possibility.\n\nIf that's not your style of play, nothing will force you to do it that, although some missions will be very difficult without having remote controlled ships or in some cases your own factory complexes. If you'd prefer to have a fleet of mining ships tearing up asteroids instead, or a fleet of combat ships following you around to help you kill pirates, or scout ships to explore the galaxy remotely, or if you just hate the idea of automation completely and would rather fly every ship personally -- you can! Yes, even the capital ships are fully pilotable and fully functional. And it is nothing like simply flying a huge fighter. They are incredibly slow but well armored and well armed, and generally bristle with turrets (which can themselves be set to automatic or controlled manually).\n\nI don't know why it took me so long to get around to trying this game. I think I was turned off initially by a few fairly subtle things: The map of the universe was very grid-like and shaped vaguely like the periodic table of elements, with gates and routes generally corresponding to north/east/south/west. This isn't realistic, of course, and I was afraid it would break my immersion. It doesn't. It's mostly just a layout choice for a totally abstract concept. You'll never really know it unless you *are* in fact looking at the map ingame, and even then it's not immediately obvious. Once you've planted your butt in the seat of a spacecraft, there is no up or down or north or west, it's just space. There's a gate over there, let's go to it. Oh, it goes to Akeela's Beacon. Is that north? What's north? I don't care, all I care is where it goes. It's no different than any other jump-gate based universe and it's just as immersive, interesting and enjoyable. Secondly (and again for some reason this relates to the periodic table of elements) is the names. Some of the race names are pulled straight from elements, like Argon, Boron, Xenon... as a non-player, that just seemed lazy and uncreative and distracting. Some of the system names seemed really goofy too, and I wasn't looking for a comedy. "Ceo's Buckzoid"? Well, as it turns out this is all just part of the story and the lore. These things actually do have explanations, and it's not a joke. Patience, grasshopper, it will make sense in time.\n\nThere's so much more to the game beyond those minor complaints, that they cease to even be a thought in my head when playing the game now, but in case anyone else had similar concerns, I wanted them to know that those concerns are unfounded.\n\nThe game is certainly not without its actual flaws though, it's rough around the edges in many areas including UI usability and complexity (which rivals Dwarf Fortress), poor weapon and ship balancing, AI, and the much-hated suicidally stupid autopilot. The way combat and movement is handled when you are watching or participating in it is vastly different from how it is handled when you are not (when your automated ships are running in the background in different sectors, not rendering onscreen). In fact it is so much different, that different equipment loadouts are required to be successful the different situations. Some minor differences in combat outcomes could be forgivable, but letting in-sector and out-of-sector become two different and incompatible metagames is extremely frustrating.\n\nBut despite these flaws, it still manages to be a powerfully enjoyable sandbox to play in, and if any of the positives I've mentioned sound appealing, I guarantee you will be able to overlook the flaws.","June 26, 2014","true","649.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has a large focus on economies, with the GoD Engine simulating various fluxuations in markets - and you can get a piece of the action by building your own factories and eventually create an empire that belongs solely to you.\n\nIt's a game that is hard to get into, but very rewarding once you do.

Travel times are slow, getting money is slow (unless you use the nividium "exploit" aka cheat), and the storyline is slow. With that said...\n\nThis game is amazing. The universe is absolutely massive, with something like 200+ star systems. There are 9 or 10 races and several factions, each with their own unique characteristics. There are hundreds of different classes of ships and stations to purchase or steal, and thousands of AI vessels to obtain missions from or fight. There are also multiple storylines; you could get dozens of gameplay hours out of them alone. And if that's not enough, there's plenty of modding support out there on the internet.\n\nSo to sum it up, this is a slow-paced game, with a few glitches here and there, but annihilating an entire fleet of Xenon ships and destoying their stations out of vengeance for the destruction of your Mercury freighter (after you didn't notice the "your ship was destroyed by Xenon K" message and autosaved over the top several times after telling the freighter to buy ware for best price at which point it decided to go through the Xenon sector to get energy cells for 20 credits because it's unintelligent and then it died) makes X3: Terran Conflict totally worth every SETA'd minute.\n\nNot to mention the space cows.\n\n10/10","April 9, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought this game knowing it will likely be as buggy as X2 was, and am happily surprised.  It's not what I expected, by any means.\n\nFirstly, the bugs I've noticed so far are minor, not game-ending.  The game is also incredibly deep.  It has two main roles that you can go with, combat and trade.  There's plenty of pirates who take specific targets, and Xenon who just kill anything they find.  It's not over-whelming though if you go with trade, it gives it a fun, easy challenge.  As for combat, wow, just wow.  There are all sorts of ships, from mobile mining bases that you can setup smaller ships to gather astroid stuff, large freighters, fully automated sector/universe trade ships, corvettes that will blow away smaller fighter ships like they're nothing, and even larger frigates that I haven't had the chance to play yet.  The larger ships, called capital ships, can even be boarded and taken over by marines.  It's pretty deep.\n\nThe voice acting is weak, the story-line is pretty bad as well.  The best I can tell the voice actors used for the plot do not speak english fluently, the conversation seems awkward to say the least.  The main plot of the game is quite optional, so if you prefer, you can skip it.  I think it's best to skip it until you know how to fight, trade, have a couple ships with trade software 3, and maybe have built a mine or two for extra income.  Save often, you'll be very frustrated when a scout mission turns into a combat situation as you arrive 30 minutes into the mission.  There's also missions you can take from other ships and stations, they pay very well and some are rather easy.\n\nOverall, to get into this game you'll need patience.  I think the graphics are about average, nothing very special but not pixelated either.  The flow of the game is rather good, always something seeming to change subtly behind the scenes.  The sound track is pretty bad as far as the music.  Honestly I don't know about the firing sounds and such, I tend to make my own beeping noises and pshwpshw sounds and I blow things up.  Usually by the time I hit my finale of noises I get to hear the screams of a boron pilot in the background.  Again my only real complaint is the optional story-line.\n\nOverall Rating:  7/10.","June 2, 2014","true","110.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Tons of hours of gameplay for the price and an extremely immersive world where you end up not realizing where did the time fly. As someone who has dabbled a little in EVE online, I have to say that the steep learning curve that I heard so much about is not too  challenging. Yes you may have to restart the tutorial a few times because of a mishap or something else, but the controls make a lot of sense and are not too hard to master. This is in no way shape or from a game you can pick up in 20 minutes and know the ins and outs, however there are plenty walkthroughs and forum posts where any detailed question will  be answered. Again I will refer to EVE online, this game reminds me a lot of the highly thought of MMO and with good reason. It has an in game economy which makes watching the markets fun, the combat is addictive and filled with adrenaline and the pleasure of watching your fleet and property grow is like no other. Try this game, and if you like space sims or any scifi ship control games, this will not fail you. I give it a 8/10","May 19, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can also be a pirate or do other combat style gameplay but to be honest there are other games that handle combat in better ways.","December 3, 2011","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

X3 has great space combat, a massive (200+ sectors) universe, a dynamic environment, tons of customization, and a complex trade economy. Only problem is it comes with no tutorial, little documentation and a VERY steep learning curve. But if you take the time to read over some help guides online then you will find the most robust sandbox Sim games ever made.\nI’d recommend the Terren War-pack or the Gold box as the last two releases, Terran Conflict and its expansion Albion Prelude, are By far the most polished in the series.\n","December 30, 2011","true","45.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a sandbox the game is great and there is a lot to it. However there is a large downside that is an unavoidable price of this immersion -- the learning curve is precipitously steep.\n\nAs with many things in life, "good things come to those who wait":\n\nThe patient should be prepared to spend a lot of time researching on the Egosoft forums for advice and assistance on how to perform what should be simple tasks. Alternatively masochists such as myself can dive in and work things out themselves the hard way, which is rewarding, but painfully slow. Those seeking instant gratification or pew-pew action need not apply.\n\nI have been playing this game on and off for nearly a decade now, and probably would have spent more time playing it were it not for Eve. To be fair Eve and X are not directly comparable genres, but both fit the mould of a space-themed game that will yield large economic rewards to those that are prepared to invest a large amount of time. I would describe X as the more 'casual' of the two games as it is single player and therefore the economy does not respond to human factors, which makes it somewhat more predictable.\n\nOne final thought. The plot and missions are weak, and almost a sideshow. This potentially poses the question, "what is the goal of the game?" To answer that I would simply borrow the answer that the explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes gave to a journalist when asked, "Why explore?" ... "For every person that needs to ask that question, I am glad that there others who feel the answer and never need to ask".","December 30, 2013","true","358.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cecilkorik/recommended/2820/","cecilkorik","cecilkorik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cecilkorik/","358 products in account","Truly a diamond in the rough, this game was my own personally much delayed introduction to the X series. X3TC is now among my favourite games ever, and it is as of this writing my most-played game on Steam. It's a space trading/shooting/exploration/storyline sandbox at its core, like many other great games before it, but simply leaving it at that is not fair, because it smashes its way out of that mold and into something vastly more interesting.\n\nA key element is its emphasis on starting and growing a largely autonomous fleet above and beyond your own personal ship. What starts out as little more than having a second ship you can give remote commands to fly to various stations for purposes as basic as checking the prices there, will eventually grow into configuring a completely unattended merchant fleet of small freighters buying and selling commodities automatically.  But trading alone can only earn you so much, the game lets you take it to the next level with construction of factories, stations, and starbases and static defensive emplacements. Later still you may end up with defensive battlegroups patrolling sectors where you have assets, groups of combat carriers with huge wings of fighters and other huge capital ships and smaller escorts to protect them. It opens up a wide array of gameplay possibilities and late game can become more like a Space 4X RTS where you control a sprawling manufacturing and military empire as you vie for economic and sometimes violent dominance with rival factions. But it is ultimately your own sandbox, so this is only one possibility.\n\nIf that's not your style of play, nothing will force you to do it that, although some missions will be very difficult without having remote controlled ships or in some cases your own factory complexes. If you'd prefer to have a fleet of mining ships tearing up asteroids instead, or a fleet of combat ships following you around to help you kill pirates, or scout ships to explore the galaxy remotely, or if you just hate the idea of automation completely and would rather fly every ship personally -- you can! Yes, even the capital ships are fully pilotable and fully functional. And it is nothing like simply flying a huge fighter. They are incredibly slow but well armored and well armed, and generally bristle with turrets (which can themselves be set to automatic or controlled manually).\n\nI don't know why it took me so long to get around to trying this game. I think I was turned off initially by a few fairly subtle things: The map of the universe was very grid-like and shaped vaguely like the periodic table of elements, with gates and routes generally corresponding to north/east/south/west. This isn't realistic, of course, and I was afraid it would break my immersion. It doesn't. It's mostly just a layout choice for a totally abstract concept. You'll never really know it unless you *are* in fact looking at the map ingame, and even then it's not immediately obvious. Once you've planted your butt in the seat of a spacecraft, there is no up or down or north or west, it's just space. There's a gate over there, let's go to it. Oh, it goes to Akeela's Beacon. Is that north? What's north? I don't care, all I care is where it goes. It's no different than any other jump-gate based universe and it's just as immersive, interesting and enjoyable. Secondly (and again for some reason this relates to the periodic table of elements) is the names. Some of the race names are pulled straight from elements, like Argon, Boron, Xenon... as a non-player, that just seemed lazy and uncreative and distracting. Some of the system names seemed really goofy too, and I wasn't looking for a comedy. "Ceo's Buckzoid"? Well, as it turns out this is all just part of the story and the lore. These things actually do have explanations, and it's not a joke. Patience, grasshopper, it will make sense in time.\n\nThere's so much more to the game beyond those minor complaints, that they cease to even be a thought in my head when playing the game now, but in case anyone else had similar concerns, I wanted them to know that those concerns are unfounded.\n\nThe game is certainly not without its actual flaws though, it's rough around the edges in many areas including UI usability and complexity (which rivals Dwarf Fortress), poor weapon and ship balancing, AI, and the much-hated suicidally stupid autopilot. The way combat and movement is handled when you are watching or participating in it is vastly different from how it is handled when you are not (when your automated ships are running in the background in different sectors, not rendering onscreen). In fact it is so much different, that different equipment loadouts are required to be successful the different situations. Some minor differences in combat outcomes could be forgivable, but letting in-sector and out-of-sector become two different and incompatible metagames is extremely frustrating.\n\nBut despite these flaws, it still manages to be a powerfully enjoyable sandbox to play in, and if any of the positives I've mentioned sound appealing, I guarantee you will be able to overlook the flaws.","June 26, 2014","true","649.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wisq/recommended/2820/","wisq","Wisq","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wisq/","798 products in account","X3:TC starts out as a space trading / combat game.  It's not a hugely exciting specimen of that genre, either; for example, combat tends to be a little too formulaic.  But where it really shines is when it turns into a sort of first-person fleet / empire building game -- i.e. when you start buying more ships and building your own stations.\n\nX3 lets you pilot every ship in the game, ranging from the largest destroyers and cargo lifters down to the tiniest scouts.  You can even just fly around (slowly) in your spacesuit.  Plus, it lets you own as many ships as you want, and remote control them all, or even automate them to some degree.  Want to fly a carrier and launch a fighter attack?  Want to join the fighter attack and let the AI handle the carrier?  Everything is possible.\n\nOn its own, with no mods, it makes for a decent but not terribly long-term space game.  The features are there, but a lot of them have subtle problems or tricky UIs that make them tedious to use long-term.  The mods are what make it really shine -- some of them are pretty amazing, like MARS or CODEA.  The downside is, although each mod does neat stuff and takes the game in interesting directions, the mods rarely interact with each other -- this isn't like Minecraft, where mods build on each other and seamlessly plug into each other.  So you might find yourself wishing mod X (e.g. an auto-trader AI) took advantage of useful feature Y (e.g. an advanced point-to-point jumpdrive) from mod Z, but unless you go in and edit the code yourself, it never will.\n\nIf you like slowly building up your space empire, X3 is a brilliant time -- up until the endgame, when some of the cracks start showing through.\n\nFor example, although you can go anywhere and destroy anything, you can never eliminate some of the annoying persistent threats to your growing merchant / station fleet -- Kha'ak clusters and corvettes, pirate raids, etc.  Blow up their shipyards?  Ships keep magically spawning anyway, and the shipyards themselves reappear after a delay.\n\nAnother problem is that the piloting AI isn't the greatest, particularly when dealing with larger ships and/or faster speeds.  You're liable to crash into an asteroid if you autopilot through a field of them.  In a large firefight, your giant AI destroyer might work so hard to avoid plowing through smaller fighters (which would be barely a scratch on the shields) that it ends up destroying itself against an asteroid / station / enemy ship instead -- or it just never gets where you told it to go.\n\nOut-of-sector combat (i.e. any sector you're not in) is safer because it's more abstract, and doesn't include collision detection.  But this also leads to discrepancies between your ships' combat capabilities in-sector and out-of-sector.  You might choose a perfect weapons combination that makes your ship a nigh-invulnerable powerhouse in-sector, but send it to fight out-of-sector and it could well find itself outgunned by (what ought to be) an inferior enemy due to basic math.\n\nEventually, even this game does wear itself out, at that point when you realise you're doing increasingly tedious things just so you can say you conquered the game.  That's probably the time to stop.\n\nNone of this is to say you shouldn't play it.  I've sunk almost 400 hours into X3:TC, and probably 100 hours of that was before I started modding it.  Be sure to grab the Bonus Pack from the official site, which will give you a bunch of little features that don't count as modding the game (and disable scores/achievements/etc.).  But eventually, do check out some of the more impressive mods, like MARS, XRM, etc.","February 6, 2014","true","394.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is no in game help / hint to guide you on this one. I only found out because eventually I looked on the wiki to see how to start the main quest line.\n\nI clocked up around 50 hours of game play before I even knew how or where to start the main quest line, and I only found that out from a wiki. Just pause on that one for a second and try and think of any other game that happens.\n\nThe game will happily offer you missions you can't complete because you don't have the equipment for them. Occasionally you don't find out you don't have the right equipment until you've reached the end of the mission, at which point you may as well load the last saved game and try something else. If you just followed someone across many sectors at <100m/s to find that out .. you may not want to play x3 for a few days.\n\nThe auto-pilot is a little derpy. It's not too bad in the smaller station systems, but probably can and will kill you trying to get around the massive Terran stations. In fact the massive Terran stations are so big (and the auto-pilot so derpy) that I've managed to entirely miss combat scenarios because by the time my ship had got around the space station, they'd all been shot down. It takes that long.\n\nIn most start scenarios, you start in a pitifully underpowered ship. It's so bad that to begin with, even completing the easiest combat missions is tricky, and you can ignore 99% of the other missions because you don't have life support cargo or the money needed to do them. I can see that aspect putting a lot of people off. The beginning is just a horrible grind with none of the upgrades to make it more bearable, and not enough cargo space or cash to make trading profitable.\n\nSo what do you do? Go wiki hunting. Find some abandoned ships, get them, sell or equip them, and begin to get a slight grip on the game. Noteworthy: This is a game you will almost certainly give up on if you don't read the wiki, and if you consider grabbing a few abandoned ships via the wiki as cheating .. then you will probably give up if you don't cheat.\n\nIf you ignore all that, there is a vast, complex universe out there waiting for you to spend hours and hours carefully constructing your own empire and fleets of ships. That's your basic deal with this game. Flawed & slow vs. a lot of potential for detailed (slow) space empire building.\n\nI'm not sure if I like it or not, but I do load it up from time to time and get a little further.\n\nNote: My hours look low on Steam for this game, because I don't run Steam to play it.","December 18, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I keep coming back to it for the same reasons that others do.  It's an incredibly complex, wide open sandbox.  Each of the dozens of sectors has its own unique look and accompanying sound track.  A constantly changing background world with a dynamic economy.\n\nSome people have commented on the very steep learning curve.  It can seem overwhelming when you look at all of the stuff that you can do.  The good news is that you don't have to try to do it all at once.  In fact, I would strongly advise against it.  Instead, pick one of the starting characters and focus on just one facet of the game at a time.\n\nI think the Trader start in Albion is the easiest because you're not dumped into a series of firefights right away.  It'll give you plenty of time to slowly build up some skills just flying around getting to know the various ship classes.\n\n\n\nOnce you've the hang of it and you've built up a steady stream of income, you can go ahead, buy a relatively powerful corvette and go pirate hunting.  Get your Combat reputation up and you can start buying carriers and other capital ships and start challenging the pirates and the Khaak in a big way.\n\nIf, OTOH, you want to dive right in and start shooting stuff I would suggest the Fight start in the Terran sector.  You'll get plenty of opportunity to fine tune your combat skills fast.","March 15, 2015","true","270.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is just awful, the controls feel clunky, the systems feel lifeless, the game gives missions that it claims are "easy" but your ship can't even keep up with the ones you're asked to follow or fight, the game itself does next to nothing to explain anything. It has the difficult to understand learning curve like EVE, but lacks any of the interesting happenings or polish that has, and has the feel of a budget title no matter what you do.\n\nApparently it hasn't been tracking my time in this game, atlhough a part of this game being completely broken doesn't surprise me. I played this all weekend and despite watching tutorials and giving it some time, it just isn't fun. This feels tedious and boring. Considering how poorly rated most of the X-series games are, this was the "gem" as it seemed from what others said. I can safely say the best these guys can put out still doesn't even come close to stuff like Freelancer. I haven't tried Evochron so that's one there might still be some hope for, but Freelancer/EVE fans can give this one a skip. If anyone is trying to find a space game to play where you can be a trader, fighter, or whatever - go give Freelancer a look. It's an old game, but it's a lot more fun than this and there are a lot of mods out there if you want to do even more than the vanilla game will let you.","March 15, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Amazing game but eventually all savegames will corrupt and there's no way of getting them back forcing you to start over from a really old savegame or scratch.\n\nActual review:\nFirst off, I love this game and have spent most of my game hours directly off of the non-steam version. I have all starts unlocked and have finished all the major plots. I only switched to steam because I thought it was more stable. Boy was I wrong. I would totally recommend this game if not for one major flaw: Save game corruption. Every save I've had eventually corrupts without fail and Egosoft's support forums are littered with reports of the same thing. The general response has been to either verify your game cache or to reinstall updates. If that doesn't work then guess what? You're screwed. Most players respond with statements such as. "Oh you lost a few days? I lost weeks of gameplay, so it's not that bad." Moderators always respond with "it's one of your drivers/your system's fault." So how do you prevent it? There are 3 possible ways that are in no way garunteed to work at all :\n1 . Some people recommend turning off anti virus software as it's known to corrupt saves. I won't even go into how ridiculous this is...\n2. Not doing the main plots -as they're known to cause glitches- so goodbye player HQ and personal hub as well as special ships and access to new sectors.\n3. To doing what's called a rolling save. Basically saving in all of your save slots for one game and saving 1-2 slots that you only save over after the end of each play session. This still has a chance of causing corrupt saves, most people have to use a mod to save their game. So goodbye steam achievements. Not to mention the fact that autosaves are known to cause savegame corruptions and any ship larger than an m6 can't dock at a regular station, so you're forced to buy salvage insurance to even save. At 3k a pop and having to save at least 3 times every hour this depletes your hard earned credits fast.\nI could actually get past these issues if not for one reason: I've never had this problem with any other game ever except this one. But when you ask Egosoft, there's nothing wrong with the game at all it's all on the player's end. Somehow, I seriously doubt that. When it's a common occurance in a game that's all about taking weeks to build an empire for a players saves to corrupt and there's no way to fix it I ask this: Why should anyone buy your software?","June 25, 2015","false","130.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even the AI is better than DIstant worlds as passive as it is. The Xenon are still better to fight against than ALL the races in Distant Worlds.\n\nPlus, this game gives you a simulator as well as 4x. You get to build things and buy fleets and command them as well from your own personal command ship which can be ANY ship in your armada. From a transport to a huge factory transport ship to any regular fleet ship. This is one of the greatest poiints about the game that you get to command an armada not just ONE ship.\n\nThere are mods galore that add to the game. You can get mods that will auto replenish your ships when they run out of ammo or missiles. You can get ships to stock NEW ships that you build even in a FLEET they will stock the WHOLE fleet with weapons an other things those ships might need.\n\nIt's just a joy to play. Much MUCH better than DISTANT WORLDS in EVERY apsect.\n\nBuy it you will like it and be glad you did. And if your're thinking about getting Distant Worlds, don't because talk about boring it's the boringest I ever played.","June 20, 2015","true","474.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I want to try all these awsome ships! I want to be a god! well good news the script editor lets you do all these things and more, it may be a little confusing at times but the number of tutorials on youtube will help a lot.\nCONS\n1: gameplay\nthe gameplay is a litle boring... thats all there is too it, it takes FOREVER to do anything and the missions(when you finialy find one you can do) are repetitive. now when you get further in the game aparently the gameplay and storyline gets more interesting but I have never got that far.\n2: death system(and save system)\nwhen you die it takes you back to the last save you did, but you can only save at a station, so say you just compleated a bunch of missions and gained a bunch of rep and cash and then you die? all lost, hours of work down the tubes.\n3: auto pilot\nok so I know this game needs a auto pilot but maby give it a better one? I have had the pilot crash me into the station instead of docking more times them I wish to mention.\nthat all I realy have to say about this game, even given the cons its still a pretty fun game and well worth the money if you can get it one sale.\n","November 6, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So for the ones which are fans of the genre interested on endless singleplayer gaming where you can do pretty much anything ('trade, think, explore, combat') a sure bet for infinite space wandering (just remember once in a while you do have a real life to take care of!). To sum it up: takes some time to learn, entry cost for lifetime spacefaring. Don't get lost in space! For the ones interested on a similar albeit multiplayer experience there's the 'EVE Online' game which provides a similarly huge, endless exploitable world (subscription-based).","January 1","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even the AI is better than DIstant worlds as passive as it is. The Xenon are still better to fight against than ALL the races in Distant Worlds.\n\nPlus, this game gives you a simulator as well as 4x. You get to build things and buy fleets and command them as well from your own personal command ship which can be ANY ship in your armada. From a transport to a huge factory transport ship to any regular fleet ship. This is one of the greatest poiints about the game that you get to command an armada not just ONE ship.\n\nThere are mods galore that add to the game. You can get mods that will auto replenish your ships when they run out of ammo or missiles. You can get ships to stock NEW ships that you build even in a FLEET they will stock the WHOLE fleet with weapons an other things those ships might need.\n\nIt's just a joy to play. Much MUCH better than DISTANT WORLDS in EVERY apsect.\n\nBuy it you will like it and be glad you did. And if your're thinking about getting Distant Worlds, don't because talk about boring it's the boringest I ever played.","June 20, 2015","true","474.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

X3 is actually 1/4th of a game, and I think the developers expected modders to fill it in with content, cause the game is full of a whole lot of nothin. Systems feel dead and lifeless, ai is monotonous and dumb as bricks, the UI is clunky and hard to use sometimes, and you have to turn the time compression up all the way to get anywhere. It looks pretty, it has the FRAMEWORK to be potentially good, but it's just that. It's a big 'ol sandbox with barely anything in it. It's like buying a pen and paper game where the first twenty pages outline a neat idea and the rest are blank with the header "Write your own pen and paper game based on ours."\nSure, I guess you could putz around for 50 hours and eventually have stations and ships to command but, really you don't have much to show for your efforts besides a bigger credit number.

Having seen the evolution of the platform from The threat to Rebirth, I can say that I am one of the lucky few who has been truly immersed in the universe.\n\nA word of caution; this game is not for the general public, this game is NOT EASY. When i started off with X2 i was 13 years old. I could not grasp nor comprehend the power and possibilities of the game.\n\n"THINK" that is the first word of the game motto. And really, if you cannot think, if you can not place yourself in the situations you find yourself being in. Do not waste your money on this game.\n\nIf you are patient, if you have a remarkable imagination and if you DO NOT mind failing and learning and failing again and again and again until you finally GET IT....GET IT!!!\n\nThis game is extremely rewarding when you finally succeed and grasp the concept. The story line from BTF all the way to Reunion is more or less linked. Playing them in succession to understand the story line is helpful but not necessary.\n\nAs you can probably tell, I am extremely biased. I have been rooting for this developer for more than 10 years  and i have seen the evolution of their child. This game is a work of art. Many may find it to be garbage... i dont blame them, i almost became one who felt the same. But through perseverence, thanks to my love of space and the unknown, i conquered this game.\n\nI give this game a 10/10 in all fields.\nSteam is a wonderful platform, unfortunately I lost my DVD copy of this game which i purchased for $49.00 CAD. I was very pleased to find the same game on steam for $17.99 CAD. It is well worth that twenty.\n\nI have played a bunch of X-Rebirth. It too is beautiful, but it is still young and needs maturing.
