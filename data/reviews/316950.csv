And what do I have to say?\n\nThe only way I managed to get through the level is not that obvious;\n\n1st. By Mouse spamming you are able to get a big speed boost which makes it near possible to get through the first enemy.\n\n2nd. Is only using the 2nd guy with his silenced pistol. Although the limit range is higher, you can miss a shot however you want and they won't notice you, untill you were able to get that hit on them since the hitboxes are where the shadow is.\n\n3rd ALOT of patience. I was lucky to study that crap "quickly" enough so i didn't gave up and was able to plan each kill precisly as possible.\n\n"Once you know how to play the game, is it worth it?"\nNo, it isn't at all. I am currently at level 4 and I will try to complete the game for the sake of my soul. Once I did that, I wish that no one will fall into the claws of the 2 developers of the game. The game is suppose to be challenging, well it is, but in all wrong ways possible. Did I mention, that the first guy, other then being able to plant explosive on Tanks, is completly useless, since once you miss the shot, you'll get killed 99% for sure.\n\nI will also post a video on how to complete the first mission as a proof, but still, this game is just pure crap.\n\nEDIT: Here the Proof of my succesfull attempt (German talking in the backround but its irrelevant)\nhttp://youtu.be/vb742ivENIU","March 15, 2015","false","6.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","10","11","3","0"

I don't think theres one person in the entire world that could possibly complete the first level only because of how choppy and glitchy the gameplay is! Don't buy it, just dont! I got it for $0.50CDN on sale and I still regret the purchase! I could have bought a nice looking skin for Counter-Strike if I known it was this bad.

And what do I have to say?\n\nThe only way I managed to get through the level is not that obvious;\n\n1st. By Mouse spamming you are able to get a big speed boost which makes it near possible to get through the first enemy.\n\n2nd. Is only using the 2nd guy with his silenced pistol. Although the limit range is higher, you can miss a shot however you want and they won't notice you, untill you were able to get that hit on them since the hitboxes are where the shadow is.\n\n3rd ALOT of patience. I was lucky to study that crap "quickly" enough so i didn't gave up and was able to plan each kill precisly as possible.\n\n"Once you know how to play the game, is it worth it?"\nNo, it isn't at all. I am currently at level 4 and I will try to complete the game for the sake of my soul. Once I did that, I wish that no one will fall into the claws of the 2 developers of the game. The game is suppose to be challenging, well it is, but in all wrong ways possible. Did I mention, that the first guy, other then being able to plant explosive on Tanks, is completly useless, since once you miss the shot, you'll get killed 99% for sure.\n\nI will also post a video on how to complete the first mission as a proof, but still, this game is just pure crap.\n\nEDIT: Here the Proof of my succesfull attempt (German talking in the backround but its irrelevant)\nhttp://youtu.be/vb742ivENIU","March 15, 2015","false","6.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","10","11","3","0"

Not to forget the AI who where tactically trained with aimbot to destroy all enemy units, including the player as soon as they spawn. You need to buy this game not only to enjoy the extreme gampley next gen experience but an insane gaming experience that you will never forget. It is completely compatible with the oculus, Wii U and the Xbox kinect to maximize experience.\n\n10/0.669696969696996969969 would delete from game library again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not buy this game.","April 12, 2015","true","0.2"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","38","6","16","9","0"
