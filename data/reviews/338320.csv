Graphics are well done in the 'classic' style with enough modern touches to not be distracting.  Game runs well and controls easily with just the mouse.  I had watched quite a bit of gameplay before buying but still consider this a 'first impressions' review.\n\nGameplay consists of running from town to dungeons and beating progressively tougher monsters and bosses.  You have a small inventory and must manage the loot, using pieces to upgrade your heroes various equipment.  As you progress you unlock additional classes and achievements.  A party focused turn-based dungeon crawler of the old school.  Along the way to/from the dungeons you encounter random events which as others have said are the highlights of the game and full of fun references.\n\nUnfortunately this is also the games biggest stumbling block.  Some of these events are simply show-stoppers - you may encounter a monster that simply 1-shots your entire party and resists all attacks/magic.  This effectively ends the game and you have to start over.  Not really an issue in a regular rogue-like game, but given the focus on loot management and stat improving that is the core of this game it can be very frustrating.   Spending hours building up your party and pouring over the numerous (sometimes overwhelimgly) statistics of the gear to decide what to keep and then having it not matter as you are insta-gibbed on the way to the next dungeon isn't much fun.  Makes it quite hard to get back on the treadmill again.  The carrot is trying new classes and new strategies, but clearly there are some balance issues that need addressed.\n\nAll in all a fun little game and well made.   Worth a shot if you like loot focused crawlers or rogue-likes (that word again...) and have a high tolerance for frustrating wipes.\n\nThat video though...perfect.  Thumbs up for that alone.","February 8, 2015","true","13.1"," 166 of 184 people (90%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","90","166","184","15","0"

Which is a pity because a lot of work has gone into it; but in all the wrong places.\n\nI was expecting a party based dungeon crawler like Death Knights of Krynn or any of the other Gold Box games in 2D.  What I got was a slow mobile port lacking any real stratgey or tactics.\n\nIn Pixel Heros you 'hire' three heros from the Tavern.  You auto-walk to the only character in the 4 building town who will give you a quest and then you click go.  The quests are instantly forgettable as they are fantasy 'paradody' quests with no hook and little humour.\n\nOn the road you will meet three random encounters which are best avoided as the loot and experience gained from them is negligible compared to the risk and cost in potions.  Actually most of the loot found is pointless and doesn't bring even incremental gains.  A 2 physical damage reduction cloak of wind immunity vs a 2 physical damage recudtion shirt of bleed immunity.  It doesn't matter.\n\nThe battles - the core gameplay - are terrible and where the tedium sets in.  Your three heros stand in line on the left, the three enemies stand in line on the right.  Only the hero and the enemy at the front of each queue can physically hit each other (with a few exceptions).  The other two heros wait at the back and cast ranged magic spells.  This doesn't make for much strategy as soon as you work out that the 'solution' is put the best armoured and highest life character in front and then max the other two heros inteligence.\n\nThe battles execute slowly with long periods of nothing as an invisible timer counts down.  There are no short cuts - only the left mouse does anything and there only two frames of animation per character.  Most of the enemies look like they were drawn by someone learning to use Deluxe Paint.\n\nThe quest / dungeon crawl is just 8 rooms in a line (without back-tracking) followed by a single boss monster.  Once you've played one you've played them all.  The only variation is the background.\n\nLoot management is a pain.  You can carry twenty items in your party - regardless of who is alive or dead.  Every interaction is a mouse drag.  You cannot double click or right click to assign or sell loot.  You cannot get a side-by-side view of items.  You cannot leave items on the floor, you can only destroy them.\n\nUltimately Pixel Heroes: Byte & Magic is tagged as an RPG but there are no meaningful conversations unless you are role-playing as a cringe inducing ape.  It's tagged as a rogue-like but there is no exploration.  It's tagged as an adventure but it has a trite and forgettable story.  Only two screenshots and five seconds of the video shows actual battle gameplay; and that is very, very telling.\n\nDon't buy Pixel Heroes: Byte & Magic.  You're unlikely to play if for much more than an hour and most of that will be spent waiting.","June 13, 2015","false","2.4"," 125 of 169 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","125","169","5","3"

It makes sense, opening up titles to a more casual crowd, but it makes the hardened fan in me wish for more of an old school challenge. If you’re like me, Pixel Heroes: Byte & Magic will scratch that itch well. It’s part roguelike, part old school RPG, and it’s often unforgiving. It’ll also remind you of just how great it feels to progress in a game that isn’t holding your hand the whole time.\nIn Pixel Heroes, you choose up to three heroes to form a party and battle evil. You can choose from a wide variety of characters, though who is available varies from game to game. After you've got your group, you can head out into the town to find a quest and prepare for your journey. The town acts as a hub, with each quest leading you to a different location on the map. Your party will automatically make the journey, though there will be incidents along the way that you'll have to play through. When you reach your destination, you'll make your way through several rooms, one at a time, each with some sort of encounter in it. This culminates with a boss battle, followed by a return trek to the town. After collecting your rewards, do it again until you've finished all of the dungeons.\nThe battle system is turn-based, with your side and the enemy side each getting a chance to use one character's action per turn. You can't use the same character two turns in a row, preventing you from leaning too hard on any particularly powerful move. The enemies don't seem to suffer from that restriction, but that's part of the challenge, I suppose. Each character has four possible actions they can take. Two of them are class-based skills with cooldown timers, while the others are dedicated to whatever items you might have equipped. Casters can use spellbooks, fighters can swing their weapons, bards can sing songs, and so on. It's pretty straightforward, but there are tons of elements, status effects, and enemy strengths and weaknesses to consider. Combat can be pretty tense as a result, and if you don't have the right equipment with you, it's highly likely you won't survive.\nIf one of your characters dies, they can be revived through a couple of ways, though neither route is easy. Should your whole party wipe, however, you're finished. The heroes will be buried in the graveyard, and you'll have to start over again. This aspect, along with the somewhat random encounters and the huge list of loot you can find, gives the game a bit of a roguelike feeling, though it's considerably less random and slightly more forgiving than the usual game in that genre.\nClearing certain stages, solving particular random events, and finishing quests will allow you to unlock new characters that might show up in the tavern next time you play. It adds a lot of replay value to the game, though there are certain parties who are going to have a very hard time finishing the game. You'll always need to bring a healer of some type, for example, so you really only have two slots to play with. I like that in one way, because you never feel like you have every role adequately covered, making for fun strategies.\nAnother strong positive for the game is its sense of humor. There are a lot of silly gags and references to all kinds of pop culture, both obvious and obscure. Many of the encounters ask you to make a choice, and it's not unusual for at least one of those choices to be absolutely absurd. Characters will often express their feelings via little dialogue bubbles above their heads, and there are a bunch of simple, charming animations that add a bit more personality to everything. Not every joke lands well, but it throws enough out at a regular enough pace that the bad ones are pretty easy to forget.\nI particularly enjoyed how banal the quests you receive from the townspeople usually are.\nI also really enjoy the loot system in the game. The loot is all random, and uses a Diablo-like system of adjectives to modify each piece of gear you'll come across. The only reliable things are the health potions, and you'll want to keep plenty of those on hand to heal up between fights. Everything else can appear in various levels of quality, with or without particular elements, in magical or physical form, with certain buffs, debuffs, or status ailments attached, and so on.\nThe problem is that even with all of the loot, random encounters, and battle variables, Pixel Heroes starts to feel rote a little too quickly. You'll die, then die again, and maybe die once more. There's not much to the game beyond fighting and choosing the occasional option, and the fighting isn't as satisfying as it needs to be to carry the game. Success is based a lot more on what kind of gear you have as opposed to your actual battle strategy. As long as you have a good selection of equipment and bring the right stuff into a fight, there's not much else to do in battles except make sure you don't run out of HP while you're swinging like crazy.\nThe game ends up being a roller coaster ride that starts fun, becomes frustrating, then gets enjoyable again until it cedes to tedium, taking one last-minute hairpin turn into frustration depending on your party build. Then you can do it all again with a different batch, if you want, but the road to success is going to be very similar, whether your team can follow it or not. As something you pick up and play now and then, Pixel Heroes isn't a bad choice.","September 8, 2015","true","17.5"," 51 of 57 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","51","57","0","0"

Maybe its the many many years that have gone by since I played a NES but I don't get that feeling from this game. Its a roguelike, linear RPG with some humor and a ton of "nerdy" jokes thrown in. Its fun, for awhile.\n\nBeyond what you may see from the out set of this game, there is a odd challenge lying under the colorful pixels. Combat can become...tiresome after a few hours playing. I've read a lot of people not enjoying the limited inventory but I only ran into a issue with not wanting to toss something a few times. Like most games that throw loot at you, this one isnt giving you great stuff after every fight. A lot of it is junk and you will spend times trying to figure out which new item is best only to find in the next fight the new DooDaad is worthless.\n\nMy main complaint, and I don't google wikis for answers to games my first time playing it, is that each dungeon is random in what type of weapons do the type of damage you need. This is that odd challenge I mentioned. I went through one dungeon with shiney new weapons only to have them do very little damage, dispite the large amount of damage listed. Have a new 60 magical damge sword? May not work for f$%k in the next dungeon, or in the dungeon your in. This gets VERY annoying VERY quickly. You can't run away, you can't access your inventory during a fight and you cant use the crap load of healing potions you pick up till AFTER the fight. (Which if I am wrong, please comment and point out how to do that.) Spending a crap ton of time in a fight because your weapon only does 1 damage to an enemy is my biggest issue. There are no descriptions of the monsters you fight so you can't really tell what will work against them with out trial and error, and since you can't open your inventory to switch out a weapon till after the fight is over, can be tedious and annoying.\n\nRegardless of the above, the game is fun and quirky. I enjoyed it when the combat wasnt needlessly tedious. If there was a "Meh" button for recommend, I'd have used that instead of "Yes" but I don't dislike it enough to say "No".\n\nBuy at your own risk.","February 7, 2015","true","3.8"," 45 of 59 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","45","59","2","1"

I've put in several hours and for the most part it's been a good experience but there are just a couple things that keep this game from being great.\n\nThe Good:\n\nReplayability: There are a lot of different types of characters to choose from and each new time you play offers a unique experience.\n\nGraphics: Fantastic pixel graphics make this game a lot of fun.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nBalance: The game feels very unbalanced. It seems like some enemies die right off the bat and others will wipe out your entire party. Leveling up your character is a very lackluster experience. If you don't put the leveling up points in the character's primary stat than you are just nerfing your character. Really there are no choices for leveling up your characters when it all comes right down to it.\n\nStory: There really isn't one. A lot of the NPC's just speak jibberish and if you are into character development and a good story, this game is not for you.\n\nLoot: You get a lot of random loot that you spend a lot of time sorting through. Most of it is junk and once in a while you get a good item but it is usually not worth sorting through it all. Although an item may have a chance of doing a cool status effect like paralysis to the enemy, they will probably be immune to it. Why bother? Just sell it all.\n\nParty Building: You are pretty much forced to make a party a certain way if you want to succeed in this game. You have to go tank, damage dealer, and healer if you want to make it through the final quest. It would be fun if you were able to try different builds and different types of heroes. But if you do, you will get clobbered. i tried\n\nThe Ugly:\n\nMy biggest gripe about this game is that it is impossible to protect your heroes from all status effects that your enemies will use. Your armor can give you immunity to certain status effects like poison or bleeding but then you will just get paralyzed every turn. Same with other status effects. With only 20 item slots you can't switch out different armor depending on what enemies you are facing, you just don't have the room with all the random loot floating in. It gives this game a false sense of difficulty but really it is just pure frustration.\n\nAnother gripe is that you can also get in endless loops in this game where your opponent will absorb all the damage you can do and you don't take any. I threw away my items and fought with my fists only to die by a infest ability that only should have done a little bit of damage but ended up blowing up my priest to kingdom come. I was on the last leg of the final quest too...grrr.......\n\nright now i give the game a B-, if they fixed the balancing issues it would become a A- it really is a good game with a lot of potential.","July 14, 2015","false","32.1"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","0"

TL;DR, if this game looks like something you might like, you will definitely like it. So stop reading this and just buy it. For more info, read on…**\n\nLet me start by saying that this is not a typical style of game for me. I’ve played my share of RPGs over the years, but these days I tend to shy away from “old-school” turn-based games in favor of action RPGs and FPSs.\n\nBut Pixel Heroes is special. Seriously, I’ve played it for so many hours in just a couple weeks that I kind of wish the number wasn’t on display. The game’s off-the-wall humor and lighthearted tone balance the difficulty perfectly. And yes, it is surprisingly difficult.\n\nHere’s a quick rundown of how the game works, for anyone who’s curious (don’t worry, no spoilers here). You start out in the Tavern, where you select 3 Heroes for your party. The assortment of Heroes available is random, with re-rolls possible (a nice touch if you aren’t happy with the selection), and each Hero has a hilarious randomly-generated biography that includes unique stat boosts (e.g. “He was conceived AND born in a chapel, +FAI”). There are 30 distinct Hero classes, many of which are unlocked through achievements. After recruiting your party, you find yourself in Town, where you can buy items and talk to NPCs. At any given time, 2 random NPCs will have quests for you, each of which will send you to a different dungeon. Accept one of the quests, gear up, and hit the road! On the way to the dungeon you will encounter 3 random events… I won’t spoil any of them, but they can be quite amusing. The dungeons themselves consist of 7 rooms (mostly battles, but sometimes treasure rooms) plus a boss.\n\nAs you’ve probably read, this game has a form of PERMADEATH: if any member of your party dies, the rest of you have to survive the whole thing—plus the return trip—to revive him in town. If your whole party dies, they are laid to rest in the Graveyard and your game is over.\n\nUsually, permadeath and other ‘hardcore’ RPG elements are a turn-off for me, but the way the game is designed, each play-through is totally fresh—you never feel like “F*** now I have to do all the same things again!” I find that there’s a fine line between a game being difficult and just feeling “cheap,” and I will say that Pixel Heroes stands firmly on the correct side of the line. I had 5 or 6 parties wipe out before even completing the first campaign, but each time it just showed me that I needed to improve some aspect of my party or my strategy.\n\nOn that point, the combat mechanics are dead simple, but deep at the same time: a perfect example of “easy to learn, hard to master.” There’s no tutorial, but the Help screen is always just a click away and gives you all the info you might need. It’s a very laissez-faire approach, like “here, have fun, figure it out!” which I find refreshing. Many games patronize their players, and this is not one of them.\n\nAs others have pointed out, item management is a significant part of the game. It doesn’t break the experience, though; quite the opposite. Initially, it can be a bit of a drag to spend time on the inventory screen figuring out what items are best for your needs, but the depth of the game truly shines after you start to see how you can trade off between all the possible item properties to leverage your Heroes’ abilities and take on each dungeon’s unique challenges. After a few dungeons it gets to be second nature. And when you gear up your party flawlessly and wreck a dungeon like it’s your job, the feeling of satisfaction is amazing.\n\nI’m going to wrap this up with a quick shout-out to the hilarious writing, as well as the randomized item names, which I’m pretty sure is a tongue-in-cheek homage to Diablo 2. At any moment, you might find a “Fly Hat of Fire” or a “Tenderizing Broadsword of Greed,” or even a “Mighty Shaft of Love.” Little touches like this keep the game entertaining well after you’ve powered through the first two campaigns.\n\nAnd to top it all off, the devs released new content and bug fixes just 1 week after the game’s release. It’s clear that they really care about their players, and about creating an awesome gaming experience, which is why I sat down to write this lengthy review. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to go help a washed-up Fire Mage retrieve his “special tobacco.”","February 16, 2015","true","36.4"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","17","23","3","0"

The ability to inflict Soft vs a Hardened boss is invaluable for instance if you have a physical damage heavy party (that's a more obvious example)\n\nThe balance of the party members you choose, weapons you use and spells you buy all come in to play. The loot seems kind of iterative to begin with, but after succeeding for a while you're bound to come across a class defining item for one of your party members.

My only cause of whining and moaning comes in the form of getting completely wiped out when you're a few quests in with good strong characters, only to realize you have to start all over again.  But as is the case with all games of this genre, so I gotta deal with it, and it only makes me try harder and get better.  It's a game where they could choke it to death with DLC to add more classes and quests and features and I'd gladly open my wallet and throw them my money just to further the experience.","April 1, 2015","true","19.1"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","63","15","24","12","0"

If you like charming, undemanding turn-based fantasy games where victory over the bad guys is determined by plans and careful decisions, 'Pixel Heroes: Byte & Magic' is for you.\n\n'Pixel Heroes: Byte & Magic' is all about working with what you're given. All the way from the start, at team composition: you have to hire just three heroes from a diverse group, and you have no control over their traits or specialties. Don't be alarmed though, you can find a balance of variables like strength and healing abilities because all the stats and skills are clearly laid out for comparison purposes.\n\nAt the central town, citizens will send you on quests. Each destination is found on a linear path, with no worries about getting lost or missing something during the trip. Along the way there, the game directly offers events to you, and you decide whether you'll take a chance in exchange for experience and random items, or ignore it and focus on the task at hand.\n\nI like to think majority of the game is played on the Inventory screen, where you can heal, change equipment, compare items, and throw away the excess. With limited backpack space, two-handed heroes, and growing needs, you address questions like: 'Should I keep this 100% Venom Fillet Knife, or hold on to the Anti-Confusion Ascot?' The answers are found in the locations, and you pick the details up along the way. 'Are enemies immune to poison?' 'Do they have magic insanity spells?' 'Why is this carrot talking to me?'\n\nEvidently, 'Byte & Magic' also succeeds because of its good sense of humor. Even in simple speech bubbles and flavor text, settings and characters are given enough personality that we give a dang about them: and this trait may be necessary in a game where your characters can get permanently killed, and the survivors have to get all the way back to town before you can revive anyone.\n\nOf course, as Rogue-like games go, if all your characters get killed, it means having to start from the very beginning again. This was the aspect that turned me off from Rogue-likes in the past, but I was surprised how much I liked this game in spite of its format. This may be because of how simple its mechanics are under the surface. One user berated it for being too simple, 'like a mobile game,' however, as a person who loves the opportunity of light weight in mobile games, I find that an advantage. The simplicity makes it worth the effort when you sometimes have to start all over.","December 31, 2015","true","21.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

You are fighting a boss who is by himself?  One of your guys takes a turn; then the boss takes a turn.  Then another one of your guys gets to go, and the boss takes another turn.  Run into a boss that can heal himself and it's like trying to smash through a  wall with a spoon.  Honestly, come up with an AP system that involves Dexterity and Weapon/Spellcasting speed and just prompt an action from a character when his turn is available.  Or if that sounds too hard, just have each character take one action and then call it a turn.\n\nThe humor gets old fast. The music gets old fast. The inventory is a mess of incrementally useful items.  Icons and information isn't clearly presented.    Each character only has two skills that are only moderately more useful version of items that they seem to have equipped.\n\nDarkest Dungeon isn't a great game, but it's leagues above this one.

The simple solution is to just throw away your least wanted loot so you have about 8 empty slots after each fight.\n\nAfter a fight your inventory automatically opens and makes it quick and easy to examine the items you got and equip the more useful gear. I think people are probably mainly annoyed that you can only hold 20 items. I think the devs did this purposely though and it adds to the rougue like nature of the game.

This time you are presented with lots of versatility for 3 unit task force from the start. Its tough and I feel simply the more you play it the game just starts to work on rewarding you more for all those failed runs. The game taught me to never use a healer, healing is best for after fights with potions. You have such little actions in fights that you will die healing. buy potions\n\n\nThe fighting?  Go hard, this is the tough and unfair. At some point fighting 2 -3 enemies, they(the enemies) get 2 attacks for my one. NOT ♥♥♥♥ING KIDDING MATE. At some point youll notice your enemies effects always land vs yours failling to an immunity, or its just terrble. I used atleast one strong Int troop double fisting spellbooks, have atleast one all spell. And depend on normal dmg and a mix for back up. Using weapons with affinties is extreme risky in unfamilar territory but atleast you can swap dropped gear between fights.\n\nIn summary, stern hard difficulty with lots of group composition and a name generating item machine after each fight with some decent trash. Sometimes its on point and after it just keeps rehashing worthless stuff you cant sell because youre on a floor in a dungeon and cannot leave until you live long enough to kill the guy at the last door or you die rich.\n\n","November 2, 2015","true","6.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

You begin the game in a tavern, where you need to hire 3 heroes out of the 8 that are available. Exit the tavern and talk to someone with an exclamation mark over their head, who will give you a quest. Your three person party then sets off on their adventure.\n\nThe quests in Pixel Heroes are random, as are the heroes you choose at the beginning. The game follows the "rogue-lite" trend by incorporating permadeath. The action is turn-based, with an encounter happening at each node on the world map, followed by a dungeon with a series of rooms and a boss at the end. After each encounter you get a random amount of gold, xp, and loot (also random to each playthrough), and your heroes level up as well. It is up to you to stat them out according to your needs and party composition, as well as give them the right gear for the dungeon you are going to. If you don't have the right gear on, certain fights are impossible and you WILL die, many times, before you either get lucky or memorize what fights require what gear.\n\nOverall I find the game really fun so far. I finally beat the first campaign today so I consider myself a somewhat experienced player by now and I would say that if you like turn-based games, retro games, and games with any or all of the "rogue-lite" elements, then you will probably enjoy Pixel Heroes.","February 29","true","25.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Of course, consoles then wouldn’t have had the capacity for a game like this. But that excuse doesn’t really appease me. I really feel like I missed out, on missing out on my childhood. Pixel Heroes is much deeper than it seems on the surface, with tons of great references and an amazing degree of challenge. The combat system only allows one character to move each turn which makes it quite a bit more difficult than your standard RPG, that allows you to heal and do damage in the same round. My most successful run so far was with a rather unwieldy group, it actually sounds like the start of a joke. A priest, a templar, and a ranger walk out of a bar. My templar tank mostly just soaked up damage or threw buffs to the ranger. The ranger lobbed out massive amounts of damage, especially while buffed. The priest kept them all on their feet. On their venture into the final dungeon, the priest was struck down about halfway through. The ranger and templar persevered to the boss, and were actually doing quite well. Then the ranger become confused. With one shot of his bow, he dropped the templar, and without a tank he followed shortly after.\n\nI spent 5 hours with my unlikely band of heroes, geared them up, distributed stats. Needless to say we had become quite attached. After a short period of mourning (literally seconds), I must continue the quest for the honor of all the fallen heroes that I’ve led to an untimely death. There are so many great things about Pixel Heroes it’s hard for me to pick where to start. The retro graphics are decent, and take me back to a simpler time. While they aren’t extremely well-defined, the point usually gets across regarding what you’re looking at. The music should’ve gotten a higher score, since making my Lets Review I delved into the Goblin Fortress, and that boss fight has THE most amazing music. While some music does fall quite short, the tracks that rock are truly awesome. This is an extremely difficult game, with the settings being “Hard” “Harder” and “Insane”. You will die a lot while learning the mechanics and how to utilize your character’s abilities to the fullest. The synergy between each class feels completely different, and as you play through you will unlock even more classes to tinker with. Experimenting with the varied playstyles sends this game’s replayability skyrocketing. While there are no skill trees, the progression (mostly done via equipment) is palpable and extremely enjoyable.\n\nAside from the fantastic gameplay, music, and difficulty, there is a bevy of nerd-related humor that is sure to rouse at least a chuckle. In the town where you start there is a blacksmith, a casino, a church where you can purchase potions and revive heroes, as well as a couple vendors selling exclamation points to desperate citizens in need of a hero. Once you leave the comfort of town, there are overworld events that randomly unfold en route to the dungeons. Even if you’ve seen the event before, the same answer can have different (and usually quite unexpected) results. Some events will turn into a battle, others will give you equipment or exp/gold and send you on your way. This system makes me wish it was possible to just wander the overworld, but unfortunately your heroes have a quest to complete. Dilly-dallying will not be tolerated. There is no exploration within the dungeons, simply 8 rooms which will either contain a treasure chest or (more likely) a battle. With no potion usage in battle, and permadeath looming over your heroes head’s, every battle becomes a gripping struggle for survival. You will learn enemy weaknesses on the fly, or be crushed. Bosses are difficult, but not so brutal that it’s impossible to beat them the first time seeing them as long as your strategy is adaptable.\n\nThe game isn’t without its flaws. Eventually you will see the same event twice, or feel the monotony that comes with fighting your way through 7 fights and a boss battle. The thing that keeps me going is the thought of conquering the next dungeon. I’m compelled to see the next boss, and smash his giant monster face into the dirt. There are always more sweet stats to stack, more lovely gear to hoard. A heroes work truly is never done. Once you’ve completed all 9 dungeons, after so many hours of pain and hardship, you can now move on to the “harder” difficulty mode. Is it actually harder? Hahahaha. I have no idea. I’ve seen the final boss once, but I want to try and get there again. That “one-more-turn” feeling is the mark of a great game in my book. This game costs less than a movie ticket and offers so many hundreds more hours of entertainment. I am a huge fan of Pixel Heroes. The tongue-in-cheek humor about its own retro graphics, along with the sheer unholy difficulty of completion is a combination that is physically impossible for me to resist. Fans of permadeath/roguelikes will love the games unrelenting (but still fair) difficulty curve. While it isn’t the flashiest game, it has quickly risen to one of my supreme favorites.

But that game surprised me. It's a great light and fast paced Rogue-lite. It merges very well simplicity with a relative depth.\n\nThe combats are surprisingly good with some simplicity but also some depth and a fair range of tactical possibilities. The combat system seems quite close to games as Wizardry or Lords of Xulima, but it has a surprising freshness coming from few key design choices.\n\nYou start at the tavern by making a party of 3 heroes that you choose among a random subset of predefined characters.  There's no real exploration and the character building is simple. But the gameplay is focused on drops, managing inventory and equipments, combats, discover gradually the specificities of each dungeon to manage them better at next party.\n\nAnother layout is through the writing, it is also light, and it is focused on nerd humor, references and winks to old computer games. But it's also a great writing, just good humor everywhere, and it fits very well the gameplay and never feel out of topic nor displaced, it's just fun.\n\nThere's also a good effort on external details, like a nice graveyard of all previous parties dead or that won, plenty cool achievements you can check inside the game, plenty stories NPC to progress, many new heroes characters to unlock. It's just cool stuff.\n\nSo overall even if few points could be even better, it's a great light fast Rogue-lite with a nice depth and plenty good humor, it's a game surprisingly fun and interesting.","February 15, 2015","true","159.4"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/338320/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3914 products in account","Welcome to Day 5 of our Headup Gamesathon. We’ve hit the midway point and today marks one of the best games in the publisher’s catalogue, Pixel Heroes: Byte & Magic. What marks this game as being such a good title is that it is a successful return to old school style adventure-RPG style gameplay. That means limited hand holding. It means that demand is placed upon the player to use their intelligence and to be rewarded for doing so. The game is unforgiving and those who do not appreciate that in their games are advised to steer clear. However, for those who do, you’ll find an absolute gem of a game and one that you are satisfied putting many hours into.\n\nAt the start of the game you get to select three heroes from the typical archetypes. That means you have your basic classes that can heal, those that can tank and those whose primary task is to deal damage. Picking the right mix is absolutely necessary. Although you’ll find that different combinations will work if you’re not careful in your selection you’ll find yourself selecting a trio that will send you to a certain death. My original selection was a warrior, a priest and a mage. It worked well to begin with and had I not lost concentration may have led to a long run. However, once my tank died I was cannon fodder. As I said, the game punishes poor execution and gameplay.\n\nThe town serves as the central hub of the game. This is where you do your shopping, pick up quests, etc.  Each quest will lead you to a different location on the map. Of course, between the town and getting to your location you will have incidents – not all of them lead to a fight – and then once you arrive at the dungeon you have to fight through a series of rooms in order to get to each boss fight. Between each room you will have an opportunity to heal (use health potions), to equip upgrades, etc. If you successfully beat each dungeon’s boss battle you then return to town to successfully complete your mission with similar events to your outward journey taking place.\n\nThe turn-based battle system provides a little more freedom – requiring greater use of logic and strategy – than many other similar games. Each character has up to (if you equip weapons in both slots) skills that they can use to influence a fight. You’re unable to use the same character twice in a row. It may appear to be a simple system but in reality it is much more challenging than what it first appears. With status effects, cooldowns, etc making strategy a lot harder. The game isn’t wrong when it says that the difficulty levels begin with hard and work their way up from there. But this is a key strength to the game rather than a weakness. It’s the sort of game that is ultra rewarding because of its difficulty.\n\nIf I had to pick a fault in Pixel Heroes then it would be that there isn’t much depth to the game. You visit town and pick up quests and then out you go and fight and either survive or die. It’s that shallow. Thankfully the reward is as large as it is or people would complain about the game’s shallowness. It’s best played in short bursts as doing the same thing over and over again can become dull quite quickly.\n\nAs a result Pixel Heroes is a great game for those who do not have the luxury of extended play sessions. There is enjoyment to be had from the challenge of the battle system.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/\n\nJoin our Steam group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified and our curators page http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified#curation","February 5","true","15.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Not much, but I'll try to remain as original as possible.\n\nIf you like Rogue-like games, you will love Pixel Heroes--buy it, it's worth the $10. If you like relatively simple, classic RPGs with a retro element of nostalgia--buy it, it's worth the $10. But if you don't care for any of those things, you might want to reconsider.\n\nAs of the time of this writing, I have logged about 27 hours playing Pixel Heroes. You may not think that's a lot of time spent to justify writing a review (especially considering the ludicrous amount of time some people have invested in this game), but I honestly think 27 hours is the appropriate amount of time that it will take most people to master and fully explore this game.\n\nAfter you have completed the hardest difficulty level, Pixel Heroes can start to feel like a very repetitive, tedious, and pointless experience. But I can tell you that until I did complete the hardest difficulty level, I was driven like a maniac to finish this game.\n\nI've read a lot about some people complaining about the unforgiving cruelty of the difficulty levels--but all that I can guess is that these people have probably never played a rogue-like RPG before. Overall, I had very few problems beating the three difficulty levels in just under 24 hours.\n\nIf you pick a balanced party (1 faith hero, 1 intelligence or dexterity hero, 1 strength hero), and play intelligently yourself (properly prepare for the dungeons), you should be able to climb through the difficulty levels with relative ease.\n\nI breezed through the initial difficulty level on my first try, lost one party on the intermediate level, and lost two parties on the hardest level before completing the game. If it sounds like I'm boasting, I'm not--I only mention this because of some of the complaints I've read about the difficulty of this game. Pixel Heroes is not a particularly hard rogue-like game; maybe challenging to pick up if you're new to the genre, but ultimate victory should not elude you for very long.\n\nIn that same vein, I rather wish there was more DLC, more challenges, more achievements, more versatility to the party creation in this game, as after you have beaten it, it can feel quite pointless. With proper care and a bit of luck, almost any party can beat the game (in theory)--but especially when playing the final difficulty level, only the standard party composition will give you what you need to complete the game with a solid chance of success.\n\nIn general, this is how I feel about Pixel Heroes: it's a great ride, if a rather short one, and it can feel a bit monotonous at times. A great ride, but once you're finished, I see no real point in continuing.\n","March 7, 2015","true","49.6"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

I myself prefer to call it the "Send-Innocent-People-To-Their-Dooms-Over-And-Over-Again"-Simulator, though. That's also more accurate!\n\nPixel Heroes is hard. You hire your first heroes, buy some potions, accept a quest and head off into the wilderness. On your way to the dungeon you fight some relatively easy enemies (unless you decided to attack Death, or pet the puppy). You see the dungeon on the horizon and your party charges through the front door. Two turns later your heroes are all dead. Killed by a sickly infestation some foul-smelling zombie cast upon them a round earlier. Now you either cut your losses, call it unfair and never touch Pixel Heroes again...\n\n...Or you stick with it, learn and grow from your mistakes. Next time you will prepare better and equip your heroes with items that make them immune to the sickness and proceed to clear out that dungeon with barely any trouble. It's easy to blame all your previous deaths on the RNG, but if you bother to look there are quite a few nuances to the game and I can guarantee you that the game is not as RNG-heavy as you might want to think. If you learn from your mistakes and pay attention to the monsters in the different dungeons your heroes will gradually survive longer and longer, until one day they might even make it!\n\nFeature list:\n\n+ 3 Difficulty modes\n+ Lots of heroes (including additional ones that unlock during gameplay) with different, randomly generated stats and zany background stories\n+ Tons of loot (probably a bit *too* much loot, inventory management can become a little tedious)\n+ A world map with semi-random events that you use to travel to and from dungeons, the outcomes are random as well\n+ Roguelike elements: While dungeon habitants follow a fixed theme their group composition is semi-random, no two runs through the same dungeon are actually the same\n+ Geeky humour (that at times might be slightly over-the-top or feel out of place)\n\nIf you like party-based dungeon crawlers (or simply enjoy sending innocent pixel-people to their deaths) be sure to check this game out!","February 13, 2015","true","23.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The lowest difficulty setting is called "Hard". If you are not prepared to accept starting over when (not if) your party wipes, maybe look for something else. You will die, and if you are the sort to be okay with that fact, you can also have a lot of fun!\n\nJust to restate, you will die a lot in this game. My first two parties wiped before I beat a boss. My third party, however, is on their way to their fifth dungeon now. I am prepared for their eventual death, though. Every time you restart the game, different heroes are waiting to be chosen in the tavern, and more hero choices can be unlocked by doing certain in-game achievements. Even though you have to start all over again at wipe, I find it is still fun because things are sort of randomized.\n\nYou might consider buying a different game if you are the sort of person who is going to rage in the forums because you can't beat something, had to start over, and/or do not get the "right party" every time. If you are a person who realizes that this is just a video game, that you can and will die, and just want to have some good old random adventures, I highly recommend this game.\n\n","March 2, 2015","true","8.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I'm giving this game a light thumbs up. The permadeath, while I find tired, is part of what I would like to see as being the main game but having an option to turn it off. The game DOES get easy enough after the first dungeon I beat, and that sort of lends itself to mooting the permadeath anyway. For me it seems. I know the game gets more difficult later. Maybe only have badges for permadeath/traditional game sessions?\n\nI would like to see character retirement options. Somehow incorporate "deleting" a character without killing them in the dungeons and maybe having them live in the town would be nice, perhaps they can contribute to the town, or have a house they can build or something, or hey, they just get retired and that's it whatever works. Or allowing us to switch characters in and out instead trying to kill one off. I've so many unlocked classes I want to try but I don't want to kill any of my current characters. Unless I'm missing something this seems like the only option. A roster would be nice.","February 15, 2015","true","25.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

I mean to at least twice what it was in the dungeon I had just run through.  Things that I was one=shotting before suddenly took 2 or 3 hits to go down and did twice as much damage in return and hit me with twice as many debuffs.

This is simply THE BEST retro roguelike I have played on Steam. Not only is it extremely witty and clever, there's enough variation to keep you interested. It borrows a lot of the quirky humor of the very very early Ultima games (you know, where you could find a McDonald's and use their toilets). The interface is simple, so while the game is engaging after you get used to the sparse documentation for all the resistances and symbols and so on, you genuinely figure out how to maximize each turn.\n\nIf that's not enough to convince you to buy the game: I stayed up until 5AM playing this damn thing, and I haven't done that in years.\n\nSuper Yes Recommend x 1000.","June 14, 2015","true","10.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However in my opinion I found that the visuals lean from being nostalgic to being too simplistic and boring for my tastes, with no updated sprites for different weapon and armor equips, the visuals never update themselves and it will look the same throughout the game.\n\nThe music it what I have the biggest problem with. Its sharp, chiptune style is nice for the first ten seconds of listening to it. But with no volume control, and loops of songs under a minute or two long, the harsh tones of the classic songs quickly drill into your ear until exhaustion.\n\nOverall it a fun game, with problems certainly, but redeemable by a relatively good replay value through randomized quests and encounters, and multiple party makeups and loot options","June 14, 2015","true","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Which was good, cuz weed be good healz, mon.\n\n---\n\nThey vanquished foe after foe, completed quest after quest, with none of them succumbing to Death's touch. Before long, they were equipped with the finest gear, and nothing at all could stun them, let alone take them down. It seemed they were invincible.\n\nBut alas, on their final quest to save the world from the abysmal lord of the Cyclopean Pyramid, they got what was coming to them. It was quite impossible for the monsters they encountered to kill them, for they simply lacked the firepower. There was only one thing in the world that could stop the formidable three: themselves. An evil-eye-thing they met on the way played a most sinister tune. The gang was impervious to being stunned, but this song got them dazed and confused. Hacky and Samira turned upon each other and wound up taking themselves out, with Death sweeping in to claim their souls. And Jamal - well, he was just minding his own business, smoking pot at the back.\n\nAll he had was weed. No weapons, just weed. He had to drop some weed from one of his hands just so that he could punch the evil-eye-thing with it and somehow take it down. (Waste of good weed, I tell you.) When at last the song had been silenced, Jamal was left alone in the chamber. It was all over, it seemed. What could he do all on his own when all he'd been doing from the very beginning of the journey was smoke pot at the back? But it wasn't quite over just yet (and Jamal had nothing better to do), so he decided to stick it out to the bitter end. He grabbed Samira's old harp and marched on deeper into the Pyramid all on his own.\n\nDeath seemed certain but Samira's harp wasn't anything to laugh at, even in Jamal's intoxicated Rastafari hands. Through the power of the Harp's cursed harmony (and his weed), Jamal somehow clawed his way up to the final boss. And the duel was on.\n\nAs the lord of the minions who proved to be Hacky and Samira's bane, the Giant-Evil-Eye-Thing also knew how to play the confusing tune of doom. Jamal was dazed and confused on multiple occasions - he would throw perfectly good bags of weed at the thing for no good reason. (SACRILEGE!)\n\nBut in the end, Samira's harp outplayed the Giant-Evil-Eye-Thing. Through an act of miracle, Jamal had single-handedly vanquished the Great Eye and emerged victorious!\n\n---\n\nJamal made his way back to the town. The townsfolk were overjoyed to hear of the Giant-Evil-Eye-Thing's demise, and prepared a great celebratory feast in the tavern. Jamal had one thing left to do. He went to the chapel, and through the great power of RPG gold, he bought back his old companions' souls from Death and resurrected them, good as new. He returned Samira's harp back to its old owner, and then the three of them went off to the tavern to enjoy the good life.\n\nThe rest of the story is just hearsay. Hacky apparently got drunk off his head on mead. Samira played a bewitching tune and then vanished until the next morning, when she emerged silently from one of the rooms, with the local blacksmith following not too long after. And Jamal -\n\nWell, he smoked pot all night.\n\n\n10/10, cuz weed be good healz, mon.","June 16, 2015","true","12.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Random number generators govern everything. It's a game all about tactics, chosing when who to attack with, trying to guess what's coming next, but the lack of tactical depth is ridiculous.\n\n- Why can you not leave a dungeon once entering?\n- Why can you not reorder the position of your party?\n- Why can you not use health items in combat?\n- Why can the enemy attack three times in a row, but you are limited to once, and cannot use the same character twice in a row?\n- Why are characters and quests randomly generated, making it impossible to predict what you will face in an upcoming dungeon?\n\nSome may defend this as an old school roguelike, but in old school rougelikes you have to play smart, and are rewarded for doing so. Failure means something- you learn from every mistake. In this game once you enter a dungeon, you just hope for the best, and hope the randomly generated characters you picked at the start can beat the boss (whose hit-points are hidden, for some reason?) after 6 or so randomly generated fights.\n\nWinning doesn't feel like winning, it feels like blind luck.

So you spend too much time sorting through items. Also, combat is stat heavy yet somehow feels too simplistic since each character only has 2 skills, and from what I see there are no skill upgrades or ways to get new skills. And, the skills don't necessarily complement each other very well. To see a rogue-like done right, check out Darkest Dungeon. You have to really pay attention to balancing your team with that game, and each team member plays an important role. Here you can have all warriors, all wizards, all rogues etc. and be just fine as long as you have enough heal potions, which are very plentiful. So long story short, this is not a thinking person's game, it's just kill a group, get new loot, equip new loot, throw most of your lott away since your inventory is so limited, kill another group, make sure you have plenty of potions, rinse and repeat. Gets boring and very grindy FAST. On the plus side, some of the humor and random encounters are pretty funny. Like where you find a dog that leads you to a hole and starts digging, and then just pees in the hole and leaves.

I don't like this, because I feel obliged to play "useless" parties just to unlock stuff and really begin to play. But I never liked achievments in general, may be ok for you.\n\nThen, the game is difficult, you can often die in boss battles, but only because you don't have the right equipment. A lot of ennemies have attacks that can inflict stun or poison, and you need specific items to protect your heroes.\nBut these items are gained by random loot during the fights, so if you just don't have luck and have no stun-proof gear for that particular dungeon, you are ******.\n\nLastly, the attacks you and the monster do have an element attached to them. Basically these are earth/air/water/fire and a neutral one, where air beats fire and so on. But the names are changed, like fire is "phoenix" so it's confusing, and it's near to impossible to always have the right weapon/armor from that element adequate for each dugeon, so you end up with just the neutral one by bypassing the entire element system, and it's a shame.\n\nStill, I managed to play 35 hours with this game, and I enjoyed it, but I don't think I will play it anymore.","February 25, 2015","false","35.2"," 4 of 56 people (7%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","7","4","56","0","5"

Game isn't afraid to beat your weiner in half with a good curve when you make a solid party. It took me almost 9 attempts to finally beat the first difficulty setting (starts you on "hard") and unlock the next difficulty.\n\nThere are humorous moments in the game, with references to people and movies like AVGN, (M)Orpheous, Mario, and so on and since characters are randomly named and generated for each "story", there are some stupid names it gives.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone who doesn't have a lot to do and is easily entertained by the dumbest ♥♥♥♥ possible.","September 10, 2015","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great replayability, lots of characters, interesting combat system and great anachronistic dark sense of humour (LOL at the priest character class joking about children). Pretty hard, too. If you enjoyed Faster Than Light, you'll probably enjoy this. It's quite different, but it's the same type of roguelike: Story with quests, semi-random events, unlockable characters and mechanics, several gamemodes and places to go, etc.\n\nAnd you can play only with your mouse, without it feeling clunky or slow. Lay back, chill and play!\n\nI especially fell in love with it when I saw it saves your games to the steam cloud. My computer died, but my save was still intact. It saves your game to the steam cloud when you exit. Two thumbs up for that! Many games should learn from this one.\n\n8.5/10","June 25, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would describe it as a light dungeon crawl with enough depth to be fun for a while, but not so much that it is a chore to play. This game gives you a good flavor of old-school rpgs, but without some of the long slogs that come with most of them.\n\nPros:\n+ Huge variety of classes means you can mix and match different parties for variety\n+ Getting wiped out seems to almost be encouraged, taking some of the stress out of traditional dungeon crawling\n+ Good sense of humor lightens the game\n+ I thought the graphics added to the whimsy of the game. They did a nice job embracing the whole retro pixelated thing.\n+ A single adventure only takes a few hours (or until you die). This means the game is long enough to get attached to your party, but short enough that it doesn't get stale.\n\nCons:\n- Character leveling system is too simple. Once you figure out what works, the creativity in how you assign skill points or choose your party evaporates.\n- Although there are many character classes, a few of them are just objectively the best if you are actually playing to win.\n- The dungeons are all fairly similar, and you run the same dungeons during every play through. This makes the game get repetitive from one adventure to the next. It kept my attention for long enough that I played through all three campaigns, but I feel like I played it out.","May 23","true","31.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
