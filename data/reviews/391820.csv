I'm going to give this one a recommendation, simply because I like the concept and it seems there's a ton of growth room for this game.\n\nStuff it currently lacks:\nSave - Load options\nGame speed option\nDoesn't save options (music-sound volumes)\n\nBut the mechanics behind the game are complex and seem solid, so I'm hopeful that it's going to grow a lot.","November 21, 2015","true","5.9"," 47 of 51 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","47","51","5","2"

It's pretty fun where it's at right now and it clearly has a strong underlying engine so you definitely feel a lot of enjoyment watching your critters grow (especially if you open up your world to play with a couple of friends)","December 25, 2015","true","36.3"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","18","22","0","0"
