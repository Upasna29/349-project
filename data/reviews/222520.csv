(eg: not able to rebind spell keys)\n- Grinding nightmare. (And you need to be fairly high-level (>45) in order to get fun from the RvR.)\n- Really stale, boring and partially broken combat mechanics.\n- Omnipresent luck and randomness. (Enjoy having your spells and hits randomly being resisted and evaded for no reason)\n- Game of numbers with no diminishing returns system of any sort. (Usually the realm with most numbers will always stomp while outnumbered ones will be completely helpless.)\n- Very dull quest system riddled with bad translations.\n- Extremely basic guard and mob AI.\n- No crafting or jobs.\n- Very limited and crappy character customisation.\n- Fundamental design flaws leading to perpetual class and map imbalance.\n- Premium indirectly and increasingly impacting gameplay.\n- Out of date graphics.\n- Dull and repetitive sounds/music.\n- Worriying direction the game is taking (such as ruining RvR by implementing instances).\n- Support system sucks.\n- Same map that will appear boring and small after a while.\n- Not many capturable buildings.\n- Many hours of boredom before a few minutes of action happen most of the days, at least in the International server.\n- Not much to do in this game outside of grinding and warring.\n- Developers track record not really good, and sometimes acting in very unprofessional manners.\n- Major ignored problems, imbalances and bugs still ruining this game after so many years.\n- Lacks a ton of polishing in many aspects.\n- Linux and OpenGL support partially broken, many extra bugs and missing graphical features.\n\nI would have recommended this game a few years ago when it still had an interesting and unique potential, however not much improvement, and instead a lot of regressions have happenned in the past few years, while the root issues haven't been cared about so far.\n\nSo as a conclusion, if you're looking for a well-made polished and complete MMO then you should not even bother with this. If you don't mind most of the aforementioned cons (especially grinding) and look for something simple, you might get some fun and new friends from it.","July 3, 2014","false","26.1"," 123 of 161 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","123","161","3","3"

MMO. Linux. Surprising quality for beta. 'Nuff said! 8/10, with room for improvement!\n\nLong version:\nLet's get the ugly bits out of the way. This game did not work when I first downloaded it (Linux). I had to reboot a couple times, use the update tool, and then suddenly - success, I got the game to launch! I'm pretty sure the default video mode was unhappy with my dual-monitor setup. This is standard fare for Linux gaming, so I was not dissuaded.\n\nOnce I had it running, I was very impressed. This game is clearly in beta; there are occasional graphical glitches and inline error codes that really don't impact gameplay at all. Looking beyond this, however, we see a highly immersive and surprisingly well-polished MMO. There are several interesting and unique features that make this game stand out, even when stacked against its more well-funded peers. The regular PvE game is nicely paced and the quests are for the most part easy to follow. From what I've seen, the classes are well-balanced and there are enough features to keep things interesting for a very long time. The postgame feature, 3-way RvR, is a really great idea and stands out in the crowd. I'm not much of a PvP guy, but this system really makes me want try it and stick with it. As it stands now, the game is great, and I love playing it - but the potential for greatness is immense.\n\nGraphics: Beautifully done, with a unique art style that stands out. Needs a touch of polish in spots.\nSound: Solid all around. Beautiful soundtrack, appropriate effects.\nGameplay: Genre standard, well implemented and well delivered. Combat variety abounds.\nControls: Intuitive and well-designed. A couple small snags, but nothing frustrating.\nReplay value: This game is HUGE and just begs you to keep coming back!\n\nFinal word: TRY IT. If you like MMO, and you can handle a few minor glitches, you'll probably love this game!","December 22, 2013","true","12.4"," 58 of 75 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","58","75","0","0"

Don't waste your money!\nCoR used tu be hard, but at least "fun". But yesterday with the new update to the version 1.12.3 this game have no sense anymore, especially for new comer.\n\nIf you're brave enough to download this game, here's what is expecting you:\n\nYou have to waste one week to reach the level 30-35. Far in the past was the level to "enjoy" the warzone, the main feature of this game. But you can't enjoy anything, because the max damage you can do is 10-20 if you're lucky. But that was "nice" because was a way to leech some exp in pvp and gain a large amount of Exp from Fort Wars. Was an alternative way to make level without doing boring quest or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ grinding.\n\nNow with the new update you can't get exp from pvp, even if you kill an enemy of your level, if you aren't at least lvl 45 you can't get exp from pvp. And Reward (exp, gold and wmc) from Fort Wars doesn't exist anymore.\n\nSo what you should do? Absolute nothing, you have to put money to get a "mount" and believe me, it's a must. The 90% of the quest is "Go to the bottom of the ♥♥♥♥ing realm and come back!" and you come back "Oh i forget something, go to the other ♥♥♥♥ing bottom of the realm and come back! BUT FIRST! Kill some ♥♥♥♥ there and then kill some ♥♥♥♥ in the other bottom of the ♥♥♥♥ing realm". Really, yesterday it took me 3 hours to do some boring and repetitive quest where i travelled around the huge realm. But if you wont do quest you can grind! Yes, grinding here is the most boring and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing to do, it's not like in the other mmorpg where istanced dungeon, group grinding or challening mob are making the thing "original". The grinding here is "Find the kind of mob that you can kill in 2 hit to maximize your time".\n\n\nNGD is trying EVERYTHING to make you bored as ♥♥♥♥ and put money to buy exp booster and some ♥♥♥♥ to leveling faster, because you can go in the warzone (THE MAIN ♥♥♥♥ING FEATURE OF THIS GAME) only at level 45+.\n\n\nSo you have spent 1-2 month of constant grinding in this game, now you are ready to go in the warzone! Congratz! But in the warzone you will find all oldies level 60 with the best gear of the game, and so again, you will do 10-15 damage if you're lucky.So if you believe the quest/grinding part is the boring part, YOU'RE ♥♥♥♥ING WRONG.\n\n\nIn the past capturing and holding a fort for 15 minutes was giving you Warmaster coin(200 - 600 - 900 ) to buy the pvp gears and stuff. But with the NEW ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 1.12.3 VERSION you will only earn warmaster coin by pvp, want to know the amount? An avarage of 3 THREE warmaster coin per kill. Want to know how much is the endgame gear, like the new rings and amulet of uberpower? 250K of warmastercoins. It means that you have to kill at least 83333 players to get a ♥♥♥♥ing amulet, the full armor is 60k, the weapon 45k, the ring 150k. So you have to spend you're entire life grinding players to get the ultimate gear (that almost ALL the oldies already have).\n\n\nCongratz you're son is graduated to the college, and after 10 years you are now a level 60 Warmaster, and now? Now nothing, there's no sense anymore, no fort reward, just skirmish in the warzone without any fun, no skill, no strategy. The team that outnumber the other wins.\n\nCongratulation to NGD, this 1.12.3 Version ruined the game.","August 25, 2015","false","42.9"," 55 of 72 people (76%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","76","55","72","11","0"

The developers are unable to find a fair and equitable way to balance realm power and one realm (Alsius) steam-rolls the other realms and are granted wishes 2-3 times a day.  The developers are more interested in releasing more money making schemes than balancing the gameplay.  While the game still has potential, it's the ineptitude of the developers in keeping this game relevent that is a huge problem. They have also not fixed bugs with their own installed game version and only the steam installed version works with any reliability in Linux (unstable in opensuse 13.2 in kde4 with the latest version of gtk installed; apparently they have issues with gtk3/4 support.) Alsius is also the only realm that has a GM available more often, which runs special events for the Alsian players, while I have not seen a GM in Syrtis in over 3 weeks from the time of writing this review. The bonus they give people to join the under-powered realms is a totally useless 20 mins of exp/gold boost... by the time you log in and kill a few mobs...times up.

It is just back to back to back downloading for the first at least 10 minutes. Before character creation, there is a download. After character creation, another download. After hitting play? You guessed it. Another download.\n\nThe final download takes like 10 years because the servers are made out of silly string. We also crashed 3 times during this period. During this time, you, like most people, should just quit the game and uninstall. The game is literally giving you an opportunity; a final chance to back out.\n\nBut, my friend and I pressed on.\n\nThe camera is uncontrollable. Moving in this game is like controlling FDR's polio-ridden legs and QWOP combined. The "combat" is just people either hitting ♥♥♥♥ with squares or just punching ♥♥♥♥. That's all there is.\n\nMy friend soon discovered another special feature. He clipped through the floor, and was unable to kill himself. So, he tried disconnecting. The problem is, you cannot disconnect while moving, so he was stucl.\n\nWe tasked managered out of this game. Holy ♥♥♥♥.

Only real interesting thing that sets it apart (not saying that this is an original idea) is the realm vs realm combat.\n\nPros:\nFree to play, so at least you aren't wasting money if you don't like it.\n\n\nWorks for linux and mac\n\nCons:\nExtremely cliche. The story and setting is absolutely boring and terrible, so don't get the game for that.\n\nThe gameplay is just a grindfest. You right click on an enemy and it exchanges blows with your character until it dies. Then you pick up the money it dropped so that you can buy weapons to kill enemies faster.\nI am sad to say that the gameplay is just typical, cliche, generic fantasy mmorpg - that means stats, leveling, equipment that increases stats, quests, and a whole crapload of grinding.\nI personally cannot enjoy a game where the main premise is to right click on an enemy, and then wander around until you can find an IDENTICAL enemy to right click on so that you an right click on stronger enemies.\n\nTerrible gameplay aside, the other reason this game sucks is simply that it is BORING.\nGameplay is almost identical to other fantasy MMORPGs, and it offers absolutely nothing original except for the (cliche and uninteresting) world and setting. The gameplay offers nothing new, and it has terrible graphics.\n\nConclusion:\nMaybe this game had some potential.\nBut like most games of it's type, it feels like it is simply designed to extract money from you with it's in game currency.\n\nThe graphics are terrible, the sotryline is terrible, the world and setting are increibly redundant, cliche and boring and feels like it was ripped off the face of hundreds of other fantasty MMORPGs.\nThe gameplay is absolutely abysmal and is incredibly boring and repetitive.\n\nPerhaps this game's saving grace could have been it's 'free to play' status.\nIt may be free to play, but it is also pay to win.\n\nMaybe you could enjoy this game if you hada few friends, and i have the utmost respect if you wish to play this game. It's free to play, so even if this review didn't convince you to immediately exit the store page, at least you didn't waste any money.\n\nThis game is your typical moneygrab buggy grindfest. It looks terrible, and it feels terrible. Frankly, it's terrible and you would be better off playing pac-man, which at least has decent gameplay.\nThis is my honest opinion about this game. I know this seems like a huge long hate-rant, and it probably is, but I just can't help but feel this game is a poorly-crafted attempt to squeeze a few cents out of gamers, because I honestly can't see anything worthwhile.","November 7, 2014","false","51.8"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

And it's to stay well away.  Firstly, the game is rather unpolished.  The user interface is rough and my character floats an inch or so off the ground.  Combat and quests are very much sameish.  Hub-based ! quests and combat that requires you to stay completely still (even changing the angle of the camera or your character's facing stops your current action).  Menus are sometimes confusing to navigate and the game seems as though it was translated from another language entirely (and poorly at that).  Attention to detail is abysmally low (I read that a dummy dodged my blow and I'll reckon that structures as well might do that.)\nThe game has a stat system, but that only attempts to pidgeonhole the player into a certain race/faction in order to play a class they're interested in to its potential.  There are hints of a crafting system but I couldn't get far enough in before the game disconnected me and I just don't have the heart to launch it again.\nThe endgame PVP might be interesting, but it seems like it wouldn't be too interesting in fixed-camera combat from 10 years ago.","March 5, 2013","false","0.8"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","0"

The way it works now if you pay to level, they do this by boring the hack out of you. The basic game is grinding and grinding and more grinding. You run out of quest in the low 20 level. After that you can do realm quest of ether running letters or more grinding.\nThere is no battle grounds to speak off, well there is but you will never get in one of them. I have had 4 toons up to leve 40 and even got one to level 45, but let's face it, grinding is not much of a game, and you get very, very, very bored after doing it for months. By the time you reach level 45 even the level boosters that they sell dont do you very much good. It takes and extra-ordinary amount of xp to reach the next level and you get a very small amount of xp per kill.\nThere is really nothing to do until you reach lvl cap (lvl 60) and then I'm not sure there is much to do after that. There are a few groups of people in each realm. You will see the same few people and they have been playing so long that they know the groups of people in the other realms by sight and name. Don't expect to be included in any of there planes because they will not invite you or even act like they see you.\nIf you don't speak spanish about half the chat you won't even understand. Don't look for groups because there's never enuff people to form one, and don't try to kill the champions or the mob leaders with a group of at lest 3 or 4.\nThey do have some form of armour, but I have never been able to figure out what goes best with what or even if there is sets or armour. Dont read the help book because it wont help.\nThis game is for people who are so bored that they won't to pull out there finger nails for something to do. It's way better than pulling out you finger nails. So if your at that point in your day. Play this game and save your finger nails.","March 21, 2014","false","75.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I guess it's because it was right after it came out on steam and there were other newer players than just myself, like it probably is now. It might have also had to do with the fact that I had quit another terrible MMO and it was a nice distraction.\n\nHowever after having played other MMOs since, I can confidently say that this is not even worthy of being in a pre-alpha stage for a game. It might have had potential once upon a time, but NGD Studios is absolute trash and this game has been stagnant for years, not to mention runs like a potato.\n\nEverything about it is primitive. The graphics, the animations, the music, the combat, etc. It also has very terrible UIs and is buggy as hell.

I wish I could recommend this game, but I really can't.\n\nI knew going in that this would be no ESO. I knew it would not be as good as WoW. I did not know, however, that it would be as unfinished as it is.\n\nFirstly, the camera/movement/combat systems are super unintuitive. The fustercluck of clicking and dragging combined with the fact that Q and E also control the choppy camera rotation make it impossible to find a good rhythm for combat.\n\nSecondly, and probably most importantly, no one is wearing any clothes. The women are all fully naked, while the men wear a glitched-out pair of invisible boxer briefs. I step into the introductory valley (called Introduction Valley, or something similar) and walk into a scene that could easily have been the result of mixing multiple nudity mods on Skyrim. Without the benefit of 2011 graphics.\n\nI like that the game takes place in a high fantasy setting (with no excessive anime influences, which, to be honest tend to spoil the genre for me). Beyond that, the only thing I like about the game is that I didn't have to spend any money on it to realize how poorly executed it was.","January 8, 2015","false","0.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The UI is not intuitive at all. The combat was lame. It took quite a while for me to even figure out how to move properly due to the camera's automatic rotation. I just didn't have fun. Like others have said, I was intrigued by the 3 competing factions and it sounded like a neat concept. I wanted to like this game but unfortunately I cannot recommend it to anyone in its current state, especially Mac users.","January 14, 2015","false","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

What happens now is u will start and level 1 and work your way up, on heaven we are friendly and willing to help, getting to 60 can take a very long time. U will need to buy a mount which does cost real money. There is almost no player without it, its near to impossible to Be active without one.\nReal Review. The main issue with the game is it is very dull, i have been addicted to it slightly so i stay, but def would no stay if something happened to my char and it got deleted. Its not feasible to get good without a little money here and there. The fact is the entire game is very drawn out, lifeless. And at times completely dead. My best advice would be to go out and play something like TERA, Everquest, even WOW for ♥♥♥♥ sake. Defiantly avoid this game unless u really wanna find a all out war game with huge battles at times.\np.s. the people who say this game is perfect and amazing are the ones who have a good standing, like me. They don't remember what it is like starting new, and its alot harder then it was for them, since the level cap was only to 50, which is bloody easy, in a matter of days or hours if u were real good. Now its 60, and thats the intense party, from level 59-60 is 1.1million exp, getting one kill is 750/1000 exp, killings monsters i.e. mob is 250 / 160.

So I feel my team and I can give a valid review, but this is also based off of our higher than normal skill through too many hours of pracice drills (versitility) and tons of gaming experience.  So this review will not reflect based off of your skill level or experiences, but limited to ours, but in this case my own.  IN SIMPLE TERMS.....\n\n\n\nREVIEW:  In a nutshell not a bad game, but lacked that excited-to-replay value for me compared to RIFT, WOW, Runes of Magic and many other MMORPGs currently and in the past.\n\n\n\nI give it a POOR overall rating and below tells why\n\n4/10   ☼☼☼☼   :-(\n\n\n\nPROS:  A bit grey = not any one stands out as spectacular\n\nColorful visuals\n\nFamiliar Controls\n\nFamiliar Interface\n\nFamiliar Questing Format\n\nFort Battles\n\n\n\nCONS:  A bit Black and white = small problems but very frequent or just straight bad\n\n\nSMALL THINGS:\n\nSkill synergy hesitation (from one to another timer/inerupts by delays) is awful\n\nAbility visuals a bit drab even at highest settings\n\nCharacter Customization could've been a bit better\n\nLeveling could be a bit faster to stay competitive even though I got a max level in about 20 hours, but most I have talked to outside of my colleagues all said the same thing, excussing the occasional other pro gamer and/or a speed leveler.\n\nStandard money trap to make the best gear which is an outdated and/or already dying idea\n\nNo professions\n\n\n\nBIG THINGS:\n\nMovement a bit clunky = jump and while using skills\n\nA.I. in this game is one of the worst I have ever experienced\n\nDEVs lack the ability to stay competitive with all other successful MMORPGs by effective updates.  I really think they think the way things are now is going to eventually work, but it will never turn around.  MAKES THIS FEEL LIKE A DEAD END GAME\n\nPvP in idea is nice, but with above stated clunkiness and poor skill synergy makes it taxing and one-sided to certain class types  unbalanced on a HUGE scale.  When I played alot I was in top ranks all the time, but limited by class to take it more seriously.  Being forced to play classes you don't want just to succeed is ne of the worst experiences ever and kills MMOs fr me and my circles when this happens.\n\nGetting to max level very quickly and then wishing you didn't because end-game content is over in a blink of an eye.\n\nMany, many, many, did I say many houors of waiting around before you can get that 12 houors of fun gameplay.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nSo if sticking with F2P and for some reason you don't like the many other better made and greater reply valued games, both F2P and P2P; then his might be for you.  Especially if you like low pop servers (lack of opportunity) so you can do your thing (Soloing), don't mind waiting for hours and hours to play an hour or so, Hate PvP, not into lore (game story base and lore is really not too interesting and very plain) or don't care about the lack of endgame content.  Don't get me wrong I am sure many guilds struggle with some end game, but once you find a god guild end game ends shortly afterwards.\n\n\nMe and my circles might still play occasionaly (PvP Limited  because PvE was mastered a long time ago) if...\n\n\nSKILLS were not so bad going from one to another (speed)\n\nINCREASED/BETTER MOVEMENT while using skills\n\nMore of a Auction House centered community\n\nClasses were balanced or at least a bit more so for PvP, squashing the one-sidedness factor for most teams and allowing a more overall variety in playstyles\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNot going to respond back to any comments and am uninstalling, just take what I said as fair based off of over 27 years in gaming experiences of which 20 are professional or find out for yourself and write your own review.\n\nbtw keyboard is a bit off (DROPPED IT) so sorry if missing some T, I, O or some other letters. Also a bit tired and wanted to rush this before sleep.\n\n\nStarted streaming    @      www.twitch.tv/sirspoony      check it out every Fridays (RIFT, WOW, DIII, NW) and Saturdays (STO, Firefall, Star Conflict) for now, but more days streaming will come in time.  I stream other sites, but advertising twitch for now.  If I am not streaming check out @SirspoonyTV on twitter.  Right now I am trying to raise a couple hundred more bucks towards a new gaming PSU so I can finally install some better graphic cards and start playing RSI Star Citizen...hope to see you there!","November 12, 2014","false","0.3"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","1"

In this tactical realm based goat simulating masssivly multiprayer online role praying game (TRBGSMMORPG) you play a role of a novice adventurer whose destiny is to find his strength somewhere in the realm and then come out as a champion of the realm's arena and later challange other realms in a vicious battle to defend the name of your realm. The real challange of this game is inscribed into finding that strenght whitlist fighting an epidemic of albino bears, wild house cats, and other gene abominations scattared across your respective realm.\n\nThis game features an abondance of various lore-provoking quests whith rich backgrounds and exellent gameplay, varing from clicking on a moving box to slay a nasty midget inside, to slapping an orc in the middle of nowhere, but reciecing 10k gold. Besides enrichig storylard and enraging quests, this game features great depth of complex mechanics such as balancing turn-rate speed, triple-clicking mount activations, hardcore cliff dying, water physics and complex spells like arcane missle and stinkcloud. With this amount of knowledge, mechanics and skills that player must learn, this is easily the most mentally-challaning MMO of 2014. The game is so harcore and casual hostile, that the first thing you will see in the menu is a red button labeled "DIE", which implies a casual scum player who can't even kill an albino bear is not welcomed here.\n\nOverall Champions of Rektum is a superb game for most hardcore players who are looking for a challange, insane PvP action, goat men, amazing quests, creative cuntamization of the characters and just general fun.

I stopped logging in using steam and instead downloaded the game launch client directly from NGD Studios because on steam the game crashed at the loading bar. I would like to log in with steam but my steam browser on my computer just crashes every time i use, except when using steam directly from the online browser, thats why i'm able to write this review.\n\nNow lets talk about this game and why i regretfully have to put it a thumbs down. The game has a nice map and decent graphics that makes it look more realistic then most ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes. However, the map is not used as much as it could be because most of the battles are incentivized to be fought at the forts or when invasion happens by the great wall gate. The rest of the map like 90% of it is used for grinders or gankers.\n\nThere are so many nice places on this map that could be used for fun battles but stay empty because the NGD management makes no effort to make these places useable or incentivizing them to be used by making some kind of quests for these places to be used and make war. This is the sad thing about this game, its got so many nice places but tends to just become a nice sight seeing tourist attraction.\n\nFurther, the NGD management team (or should i say gang members) give special privileges to those forum users who they consider to be valuable assets (meaning to those players who put alot of money into the game). They tend to discriminate against players who don't put as much or little to no money into the game. For example if your commenting negatively on a certain aspect of the game or in their bad management they will ban you. But if your those special people who put alot of money in the game you will get banned and they won't. You see theres a certain gang of developers and ingame players that run the forum so if you disagree to much with them or dare say you won't spend money on the game if you don't get an apology for their double standards and bad actions against you they will bann you indefinitely. They seem to think they can treat you bad and get away with it. Maybe all that GM and NGD developer thing has gone to their heads. I'v tried to advice them in a respectful and civil way on forum but all i get from them is a ban.\n\nAnother part of this game that is disappointing is the leveling. I think what will some it up is this. Its crap. Its horrible. If you don't think so go grind yourself a knight to level 60. To get to level 60 you have to get like 10 million plus experience. Its insane!\n\nThere has been attempts by the developers to change this game but the changes are not tackling the main problems. They seem to just be tweaking spells here and there and hoping this will make more players stay. Another disappointing fact is that they've removed TDM which was probably the funnest part of the game for me. It was like taking the heart out of the game. I see the developers of the game complain about "servers don't pay themselves" and "we want to attract more players". But all they seem to do is to make little events or tweak spells here and there in the hopes that more players will come, but this, tends to compound the problem and make more imbalance issues. Something we don't need!.. Its like an addiction for them.

Well maybe back then when I used to play it. I used to play before they added it to steam, and when Horus servers were up. My cousins and I all joined Alsius, and we powerleveled like crazy. I bought horses with ximermin before they were permanent -_-. I stopped playing Regnum Online a long time ago because I was just busy with my middle school life. I played Regnum for Hours at nights, and the game in general is good. Now why am I saying not to play this game? Well, The company really doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about its players, and there's a lot of bugs in both there website and there email system. I downloaded Regnum Online from steam to play it again. I finished downloading and tryed to log in and it told me it was sending verfication to my email to confirm the computer or something. I logged into the email sociated with the account from my childhood and there was no verification email. I tell myself it's a bug but when I try to go to the request help page I can't log in no matter how hard I try. So I submit a request help somehow and I can't even look at it I have to check my email to see what they say because there's no way for me to log in. They tell me even though I have my login information, my email sociated with the account, that I know the password that I still need some verified proof because there email verification email is messed up. I'm so old in that game one of my characters name is literally "Alsius Legend". It's to bad I will never care enough at this point to try and get my account because they're making it to hard for no reason. I just had to say this, and still a amazing game, I enjoy the wars and the whole concept with the gems.","February 4, 2015","false","0.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","0"

No worries.\nRestarted the game and selected my character and the up came the loading screen again, and also the downloading thing. speed would vary between 20 and 300 kb/s i left it for a few min thinking 30 seconds ago i was in game and able to run around and whatnot. but it seemed to want to download another huge ammount of data for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t reason.\nSo i uninstalled, its taken me about 3 hrs since downloading a small 1gig game to be able to change the vid settings. so ♥♥♥♥ it.\nI dont reccomend.","May 16, 2014","false","1.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I then tried to figure out how to attack and set up spells, but it became way too frustrating!  It's not set up to fight like Diablo, it's more like the old Neverwinter Nights game where you click on the monter to attack and then wait...  In this game, you have to click twice, but it didn't attack, well I couldn't figure it out anyway.  I died once from falling off of a cliff, but not 5 feet from where I fell, there were invisible barriers preventing me from falling off the same cliff.  You can try this game, but I don't recommend it in it's current state.  I experienced video bugs, multiple crashes and major frustation!!!  Plus I didn't see any real players in town, just NPC walking around and there were only about 4 of them!  I was hoping to find a cool free-2-play WoW clone, but not this game!  Dev's, please make it fun to play!  People want fast action, not click and wait battles...  Maybe I'll try playing again tomorrow...","April 20, 2014","false","0.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Its midi files gone mad!  nothing says inspiring music like a manic drumbeat that incessiantly pounds in the background during a battle untill you want to smash your head into a wall to make it stop.\n\nHow about Combat?  why would you want fancy "auto-targeting" or "Targeting" at all?  no this is all about "skill" as in the skill to manually click every single target one at a time then click your skills on the "hotbar" to kill them... FUN!!\n\nPerhaps the Beautiful 1995 graphics will get your blood stirring?  no?  running through walls and floor textures? 4 options for character customization?  non-existant PvE interest?  extremly weak PvP combat?\n\nThis game tries so hard to take the best part of Dark Age of Camelot and bring it up to date and fails so spectacularly that its almost stunning, you almost HAVE to see how bad it is to belive it.   I dont know how people could possibly spend the 4-6 months to get to level 60  (thats right you read it correctly.... 4 - 6 MONTHS!)\n\nthis game is a test for a masochist... and even they are bowing out.\n\n1 out of 10... id give it a 0... but the game actually loaded up with a title screen so... there you go.","March 7, 2013","false","0.3"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Toxyclean/recommended/222520/","Toxyclean","DSK Xiphon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Toxyclean/","363 products in account","My reviews are based off of whether I would recommend the game to the community as a whole.  I personally love this game, but I can't recommend it to everyone.\n\nBasis of the Worlds:\n\nThere are three areas to choose from: Syrtis; The forested lands, Alsius; the arctic lands, and Ignis; the badlands/desert.  It is built to be a PvP (or rather Realm vs Realm) game the way it it set up; stealing artfacts and capturing towers in the name of your kingdom.\nAt first glance, each kingdom is well put-together.  You later realise that most of your kingddom is a barren wasteland, with nothing to do but grind enemies.\n\nThe Community:\n\nThe community on here is rather small, but it is both active and kind.\n\nBasis of Combat:\n\nThere are three classes to choose from: Melee, Archery, and Magic, which can further be divided based on how you wish to play.  It's been a while, so I don't quite remember the class names aside from the warior's subclasses of Knight and Barbarian.     It doesn't get exceedingly difficult as far as combat mechanics go.  It's simply click, click again to attack, and pick a number for a quick technique.\n\nThe Leveling:\n\nAt first, the grind is not as apparent as you'd think.  You tend to level easily for the first ten levels or so upon simply turning in quests.  However, it becomes a monotonous slaughterfest trying to grind out enemies to reach the next level.  Quests begin to be more trouble than reward, so grinding enemies becomes the best option.\n\nPay To Win Aspect:\n\nPeople see you are able to but items with real money, so they immediatelly critisize the game for being a "pay to win" game.  This couldn't be further from the truth.  There is ONE thing that seems mandetory to buy; that is a mount.  All a mount does is allow for quicker travel IN YOUR OWN KINGDOM, because trying to use a mount in PvP WILL get you killed in most cases.  The most commonly bought items, aside from mounts, are vanities: NO BONUS TRAITS.  I have invested quite a bit of time in this game, not even counting outide of Steam, and I have not ONCE bought an item from the market.  It has a market, but it is not pay to win.\n\nOther Notes:\n\nThis game has an amazing soundtrack, though there aren't many songs.\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nI've invested a decent amount of time in this game, mostly outside of Steam.  I've played as each kingdom, race, and class.  I do like this game.  The RvR aspect doesn't quite speak to me as much as it does many; I simply love partying new people, showing them the ropes and a few tricks, and just chilling listening to music.  I could almost be called the Human NPC.\nThe game is a very casual game for the most part, until you decide to go into the RvR area.  The combat is pretty much relian on your level, your weapon, and your chosen skills.  Most of the people will be in the upper 40s, 50s, and 60 (which was the cap when I last played), so you will have to be sure to grind a lot before going RvR.\nThis is one of those games I pay half-attention to.  I watch a movie or just chill in general when I play.  There isn't a need for serious attention unless you're doing RvR.\n\nWhy I Can't Recommend It:\n\nThere are a few reasons as to why I can't recommend this game.\nFirst-Though the community is active, there are nowhere near as much players at a time as a few other MMOs.\nSecond-While I'm used to grinding, most people will not feel that it's worth it.  It takes a long time.\nThird-The quests are nothing special.  Most of the time, you will get a quest with the same structure over and over in different areas, and the rewards become worthless, aside from money.\n\nWho Do I Recommend It To:\n\n-People looking for a very xasual MMO\n-People looking for a small but active community to play with\n-People who don't mind a monotonous grind.\n\nI do like this game, and I will continue playing it until the servers shut down, but it's not for everyone.","June 22, 2014","false","42.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Toxyclean/recommended/222520/","Toxyclean","DSK Xiphon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Toxyclean/","363 products in account","My reviews are based off of whether I would recommend the game to the community as a whole.  I personally love this game, but I can't recommend it to everyone.\n\nBasis of the Worlds:\n\nThere are three areas to choose from: Syrtis; The forested lands, Alsius; the arctic lands, and Ignis; the badlands/desert.  It is built to be a PvP (or rather Realm vs Realm) game the way it it set up; stealing artfacts and capturing towers in the name of your kingdom.\nAt first glance, each kingdom is well put-together.  You later realise that most of your kingddom is a barren wasteland, with nothing to do but grind enemies.\n\nThe Community:\n\nThe community on here is rather small, but it is both active and kind.\n\nBasis of Combat:\n\nThere are three classes to choose from: Melee, Archery, and Magic, which can further be divided based on how you wish to play.  It's been a while, so I don't quite remember the class names aside from the warior's subclasses of Knight and Barbarian.     It doesn't get exceedingly difficult as far as combat mechanics go.  It's simply click, click again to attack, and pick a number for a quick technique.\n\nThe Leveling:\n\nAt first, the grind is not as apparent as you'd think.  You tend to level easily for the first ten levels or so upon simply turning in quests.  However, it becomes a monotonous slaughterfest trying to grind out enemies to reach the next level.  Quests begin to be more trouble than reward, so grinding enemies becomes the best option.\n\nPay To Win Aspect:\n\nPeople see you are able to but items with real money, so they immediatelly critisize the game for being a "pay to win" game.  This couldn't be further from the truth.  There is ONE thing that seems mandetory to buy; that is a mount.  All a mount does is allow for quicker travel IN YOUR OWN KINGDOM, because trying to use a mount in PvP WILL get you killed in most cases.  The most commonly bought items, aside from mounts, are vanities: NO BONUS TRAITS.  I have invested quite a bit of time in this game, not even counting outide of Steam, and I have not ONCE bought an item from the market.  It has a market, but it is not pay to win.\n\nOther Notes:\n\nThis game has an amazing soundtrack, though there aren't many songs.\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nI've invested a decent amount of time in this game, mostly outside of Steam.  I've played as each kingdom, race, and class.  I do like this game.  The RvR aspect doesn't quite speak to me as much as it does many; I simply love partying new people, showing them the ropes and a few tricks, and just chilling listening to music.  I could almost be called the Human NPC.\nThe game is a very casual game for the most part, until you decide to go into the RvR area.  The combat is pretty much relian on your level, your weapon, and your chosen skills.  Most of the people will be in the upper 40s, 50s, and 60 (which was the cap when I last played), so you will have to be sure to grind a lot before going RvR.\nThis is one of those games I pay half-attention to.  I watch a movie or just chill in general when I play.  There isn't a need for serious attention unless you're doing RvR.\n\nWhy I Can't Recommend It:\n\nThere are a few reasons as to why I can't recommend this game.\nFirst-Though the community is active, there are nowhere near as much players at a time as a few other MMOs.\nSecond-While I'm used to grinding, most people will not feel that it's worth it.  It takes a long time.\nThird-The quests are nothing special.  Most of the time, you will get a quest with the same structure over and over in different areas, and the rewards become worthless, aside from money.\n\nWho Do I Recommend It To:\n\n-People looking for a very xasual MMO\n-People looking for a small but active community to play with\n-People who don't mind a monotonous grind.\n\nI do like this game, and I will continue playing it until the servers shut down, but it's not for everyone.","June 22, 2014","false","42.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you can get past the meh textures and obnoxiously loud town/village music It's pretty fun, yes it's bad compared to other f2p mmo's avalible on steam, (LOTRO Being by far the best and well worth playing.)\nThe only thing that really saves this game is the interesting pvp and area grabbing aspect that and the ammount of trolls, makes for a few laughs.","March 20, 2013","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"
