She becomes entangled into the affairs of her best friend, Catherine, and her betrothed, Guilleme.\n\nThe main theme in this story is love - the good and the bad kind.\n\nIt is an extremely well-written visual novel, the pace is just about right, with beautiful artwork and sound-effects to accompany this. It is not your typical visual novel, it has very dark mature content (think psychological horror), so it can become quite complex and disturbing, but I LOVE that!\n\nAs this is a free visual novel and it delves into controversial topics, I can see people trying this out and well… not liking it. So I would not recommend this if you do not like dark disturbing content, or reading visual novels, neither would I recommend this as a first visual novel.\n\nHowever I highly recommend this if you like psychological horror, the twisted kind.","March 6","true","6.3"," 78 of 85 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","78","85","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pointnclickster/recommended/421670/","pointnclickster","Pointnclickster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pointnclickster/","315 products in account","When a friend of mine posted her screenshots of this visual novel, I was both intrigued and slightly disturbed at the same time. I would walk away from my computer, but those images would stay in my mind. I never thought I would play something like this, but you know what they say...\n\nSo once the kiddos were safely put to bed, I played it, prepared for a really sordid, disturbing, gratuitous time....and actually got something quite different.\n\nNothing in this visual novel is gratuitous. This visual novel really is a dark fairy tale at heart, taking its inspiration from Greek/Roman mythology, which can also be pretty twisted if you read it. The story itself (I really don't want to spoil too much, since you get enough of a hint from the store page.) is dark, sensual, and passionate. However it can also be endearing, touching, and lighthearted. The tricky thing is that this visual novel can change tones in a heart beat, so when it goes from light to dark or disturbing, it can be really startling. I know I jumped a few times, because there is no warning. There are many many achievements because there are so many ways that this story can be played. The game is only as twisted as you want it to be. The first time I played, my character had a good motivation, and the mother was not as abusive as she could be, but understanding and ultimately fueled by a parent's love. As a mother, I couldn't help but insert myself in the mother's role and try to pick the best responses. When you go down that path, you reach the happiest and least sordid of endings. But then I got curious...and I discovered that the more dark you want the game to be, the story will match how far you want to go....and it can go a LONG way downhill. Far worse than the sexual content of this game (since most of it is read anyway) are the themes of child abuse and verbal abuse.\n\nNow the look of the game is beautiful. I love the Victorian time period, and the colors are just gorgeous. I loved the fashion and the beautiful places you get to go to. The game features some disturbing visuals as well, but they are done in a way that you can't really look away. I've never played any other visual novels except The 39 Steps, so for a Free to Play, I would say this is very very good work.\n\nThe soundtrack is gorgeous. It fits the time period perfectly, and also includes classical music when appropriate to the story. The sound effects build tension in the game when necessary, whether its fear, anxiety, insanity, or sexual tension.\n\nNow some cool extras. I've already mentioned the many achievements and the multiple endings, but there is more! There are extras that tell you about the inspiration of the story, how the game was made, and the road that was taken to make the game a reality. The more achievements you get, the more you unlock, rewarding you with entertaining and hilarious extras! I really enjoyed learning about the creative process since it helps you appreciate the story more.\n\nSo in the end, I am really glad that I played/read it. I would hope that my review would answer questions or relieve any doubts for other players who are kind of on the fence about titles like this. This visual novel poses interesting questions on the nature of love, and its many faces and disguises. It also takes an interesting look at the question of loving someone and acting out of fear. For a Free to Play, this has a whole lot to offer.","March 23","true","8.3"," 72 of 79 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","72","79","0","3"

It also happens to be an OELVN, so it proves that occidental visual novels have nothing to envy to Japanese ones. The attention to details and work put into it are not what you would expect from a non commercial one.\n\nThe peculiarity in this visual novel is that the player has to play as a third person point of view character — that of Mother. Whether you'll find yourself trying to manipulate or consoling, know that your choices only end up affecting the main character's actions and not completely controlling them.\n\nAs the plot takes form, you start to notice that the story is all centered around the theme of love, but not in the traditional 'romance' sense. All its good and bad qualities are present. Be they an obsessive, abusive, twisted love, or storge, love between friends, carnal love.\n\nThe story has a nonlinear narrative, events are portrayed out of chronological order. It also sometimes changes perspective from one character to the other, so that the player gets to see other sides to the story.\n\nThe artwork is well done, the character sprites have several expressions. Some CGs have a variant for who enables the mature filter content. I wished that the menu had a larger and more visible font.\nI loved the music. There are famous pieces (Bach, Rachmaninoff, etc.) next to original ones that I found haunting and difficult to forget (in a good way!).\nI found myself surprised in front of details such as the sound effects that were so spot-on with the scenes.\n\nThere are four endings and one secret bonus ending that you can get when you unlock all the previous ones.\n\nI'd like to state that maybe you should step back from this game if you think that its dark themes might be too much for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/duszynski/recommended/421670/","duszynski","A Star in Darkness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/duszynski/","155 products in account","This visual novel contains the following adult subject matter, which could be triggering for some: nudity, incest, physical abuse, mental abuse, verbal abuse, physical assault, r/a/p/e, blood, murder, self-harm, suicide, and general depressing/disturbing scenes.\n\nThis story was not quite what I expected. It was a pleasant surprise, but I wasn't quite prepared for such a serious/depressing story. It definitely is worth money, so I'm not sure why it's free. In fact, it is one of the best visual novels I've read on Steam.\n\nThere are five different endings, including a secret ending. They range from disturbing to less disturbing. While I suppose there are good and bad endings, there aren't really happy endings. I suppose someone could interpret one of them as happy, but it wouldn't be in a conventional sense.\n\nHonestly, trying to give a description of the story is difficult. It's quite abstract. The main theme is love; I guess you could say the dark side of love. The side of love that can drive a person insane over it. While some claim that love is the best feeling in the world, no one can deny that it is also tied to such feelings as pain, loneliness, and obsession.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this visual novel to anyone who has strong feelings about the subjects listed above. It is very dark and disturbing. If you're used to lighthearted VNs, this probably isn't for you.","April 26","true","18.0"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","27","30","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XaMcTepA/recommended/421670/","XaMcTepA","♫ MoPcKo cBuH4e :d","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XaMcTepA/","173 products in account","First I'd like to say that English isn't my native language so a lot of the words in the text were new/unfamiliar to me. However, I understood what the text is about and that's all that matters, right?\n\nI've played the game for about 2-3 hours then I stopped because I had to eat and after that I didn't want to continue. I was hesitating if I should continue reading or not. I don't like leaving things unfinished so I continued reading the day after that and I am glad I did.\n\nThe story isn't short but it's not too long either. Took about 10 hours to get all the endings and check the bonus content. Keep in mind that I skipped the text that I'd already read. Yes, you can skip text which you already read. There are several endings (I won't mention how many exactly as I don't want to spoil anything). I enjoyed all of them, some more than others. Overall, I liked the story but I can't say it's one of the best visual novels I read as some people said. Not that I didn't like it, just... maybe because there were so many new words for me that I regretted not knowing English better. I hope that changes one day.\n\nThe characters are also nice. They are well-drawn which is a plus because I've played some visual novels where the characters are kinda not-so-well-drawn and some people would lose interest in the game because of that. I wouldn't though, because it's story that matters not how characters look. I liked almost all of the characters. I wanted this review to be spoiler-free but I will have to use a spoiler here. If you haven't played the game I suggest skipping this spoiler. So as I was saying, there is a character that I didn't like much. It's the mother. Yes, she tells her daughter how to stay out of trouble which is good and it's what most mothers would do, but what I didn't like is how she reacted in Chapter 5, I think, where she beats her daughter so badly that later she would hide her wounded eye. Also mother's tone when she speaks to her daughter from the very start till the end is what I didn't like, but it's part of the story.\nI liked the other characters. I don't have a favourite character so lets say I like them equally.\n\nThe music is great, really. I would like to be able to buy the original soundtrack as I enjoyed listening to one of the songs a lot. It's so peaceful and relaxing. Would be really nice to be able to listen to it not only while playing the game especially now that I finished the game and got all of the achievements...\n\nThe art is very good. I enjoyed all CGs (If you've played other visual novels you would know what that is, as I can't really explain it). I can't say a bad thing about the art as it's excellent. In my opinion everything is drawn in a way that pleases the eye.\n\nThe bonus content is something you should definitely check after/if you get all the endings. I found some of the stuff there hilarious and I think you will too. Not going to spoil anything more. One spolier is enough.\n\nThe achievements are many and unlock after some dialogs or when you reach an ending. Perfect game (no pun intended) if you're an achievement hunter/completionist like myself. It's not hard to 100% it but some people would do so in 1-2 hours by skipping all of the text, which is stupid if you ask me.\n\nTo sum up, I enjoyed playing/reading "CUPID" and, I am repeating myself here, but I am looking forward to buying the original soundtrack if it becomes available, which I really hope so. I am not going to give this game a score as I don't think that's necessary.\n\nAlso, I supported the dev by sending them money via PayPal. I did that because I think this game shouldn't be free or at least should have artbook/original soundtrack DLC(s). If you want to support them too just look at the community hub. There is a thread where the dev gives their PayPal donation link and one other link.\nYou know what the sad thing is? That there are flash-games (ltterally) which are free on some online sites but they have a price, here, on Steam. And it's something like 5 euros, which isn't much, but for a game that you can play for free somewhere else is a rip-off if you ask me. What I am basically saying is that there are visual novels on Steam that are worse than "CUPID" and are not free. I mean, this isn't fair. Life is unfair. But you can make it fairer by supporting the dev. I am kidding of course. I can't force you to do that, but if your a kind soul I am sure you will. :)","March 30","true","9.7"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","21","21","0","0"

Their personalities are concrete. You love them then later on hate them, then decide it has to be both.

It's worlds better than some games that I've paid $10+ for and I didn't have to spend a dime on it. Almost enough to make a person feel guilty.\n\nAlthough love is the overall theme, what really sucked me in initially was the suspense and feeling of slow creeping terror. The atmosphere is wonderful -- writing and art are not perfect but almost always great, and what more can you ask from a free game? They work together to do an excellent job of building tone, creating a sense of gradual mounting tension, and really evoking the feeling of a whole world with a few static images.\n\nI got ending 3 the first time through despite doing my very best to make nice decisions, and once I'd finished reading that I felt like I needed a bath, in the best possible way. There they were, this character doing something unequivocably evil, and yet in a certain sense I couldn't even blame them for it. I was sucked in by the perversity and the mystery of it all and immediately had to dive back in for more.\n\nIf I were to voice any criticisms, they would mainly be:\n\n1) From the author's notes bonus I gather that the main writer assumes the meaning of the title "Cupid" would be obvious once you've finished the endings, but I was reading that with four endings under my belt and the idea hadn't even occurred to me in the slightest. I assumed it was supposed to be more of a general reference to love and matchmaking. If this was an idea the team wanted to convey to readers or thought was important, I think they unfortunately did a poor job.\n\n2) The summary blurb for the game in the Steam Store pushes the idea of the player directly stepping into the role of Mother, but this is very misleading. "Mother" is very much a specific character of her own with a specific personality, goals, etc. that you the player do not get to affect very much. One of my big pet peeves in visual novels and text adventures is when you get presented with "false choices" where nothing is available on your list of options that's remotely like what you actually want to say. This game had some fairly egregrious examples of that, particularly being forced to be mean to Rosa and then having the game chide me for my bad attitude in one ending even though, given the option, I would never have said any of those mean things at all. This irritating problem could have been avoided by finding some way to include Mother that didn't require her to be the POV character.\n\nOverall however, these are small issues at the end of the day. This game would be well worth your time at $20 or $30, let alone at the price of totally free.

Popping my reviewing cherry because I enjoyed it so much. I'd love to see more like this.\n\nThere are so many similar VNs out there, and most of them fall short in some aspect or another. Cupid is different from the usual suspects in style and substance, and it's probably one of the best I've played so far. The concept of Mother is unique, it's told in a non-linear fashion which really works for the story imo, the artwork and audio fit extremely well together, and it exceeded my expectations all round.\n\nI'm a writer, so I'm always interested in story-rich games, but it's hard to find many that keep me interested through multiple playthroughs. Cupid worked on every level for me, so I'm pleasantly surprised and impressed. Seriously, more please. (Also, thumbs up on the achievements).\n\nIt's not an excessively long game either. There are four endings plus a secret end, then some bonus stuff. The journal is fantabulous. :D And it's a pretty effed up gothic romance, so well done on that.\n\nFIXED: *Waiting for a fix to an issue with ending one not unlocking in the bonus section, but that's my only complaint - and one that can be fixed.*","March 5","true","5.3"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","13","16","2","0"

I was glued to the screen the entire time in a trance, there's just... wow. And this is FREE. I actually wouldn't have minded at all to pay for this. This game is now sitting in my own top list of favorite visual novels, and it really deserves to be played by anyone else who likes them.\n\nI'm going to keep playing this for all the endings, I just have to.\n\nAlso, the sprites and cgs? They aren't bad at all. The art style is a lot more on the realistic side than the anime side. I thought some of them were absolutely gorgeous, and others were absolutely terrifying. It's not joking with the M rating. The sound effects and music overall, especially where there is no music, is just perfect!\n\nBesides the overall story, my favorite thing is that you are Mother. You'll read in first person at some points, but you are always influencing Rosa as Mother. She doesn't have to listen to you either, and the more I got into the story the more I picked answers I thought would make Rosa listen to herself more. Mother does love her, but... y'know, the whole "mother knows best" isn't always right.\n\nSo, play it. It's free. There's no reason not to try it if you're even just a little bit interested.\n\nEdit: After putting in more hours, I've thought a lot more about what I'd like to say about this game.\n\nIt is not for everyone. The game even has a mature filter, which only works on the CGs to my understanding. I'd compare it to a VN that has a mature filter for sex scenes, but keeps in the details for the plot. (also, there is one sex scene in the game. I don't think it's skippable.)\n\nWithout giving away exactly what could be so bad besides what we all know rated M stuff can have, just look through the achievements. On the other hand, stay away from them if you don't want to know.\n\nThere is currently a bug that is being worked on concerning one ending that doesn't "unlock" even if you manage to get it. I've gotten it twice. Besides that, I don't think there are any other bugs. It's only annoying if you want 100% completion rate to unlock bonus stuff,  and the secret ending that you only get if you've done all the other endings. Fixed with an update.\n\nI love this game, I really do. Would I want a sequel? No, there's no reason for it.

To be honest I was somewhat skeptical of trying out the game myself, not being a fan of darker, gritty themes, but I figured since it was free and had an appealing art and story it was worth a shot. I am so very glad that I did.\n\nThis VN will definitely not be everyone's cup of tea simply because of the darker and more mature storyline that it explores. The story and somewhat uncomfortable topics are handled very well though and I never wanted to stop in the middle of a playthrough because it felt...dirty or whatever. Yes, I did find myself pulling faces at some points but it did not detach from the VN itself. At it's core Cupid uses it's story to explore the different, and sometimes darker, sides of love, the sides that we maybe don't always see or don't even know exist.\n\nThe characters are all lovely and you can see so many different sides to their personalities in the short time you go on the journey with them. There is also the very interesting character of the Mother, who is essentially the player basically talking to Rosa throughout the game. Instead of directly making any choice, you play as the voice of Rosa's beloved mother guiding her.\n\nIf you have interest in the game at all, I highly recommend giving it a chance, it is free after all. And aftering playing a while and potentially finishing one route you will know for sure whether you want to keep playing or not.","March 6","true","3.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

You can chose to be cynical, cruel, or stern in dialogue choices that have an effect on the actions of your daughter. The story is set in 18th century France and follows the lives of three individuals who become entwined in a tale of passion, love, lust, loss, and revenge.\n\nPros:\n- Well drawn art, it's manga but it's clearly influenced by the Victorian setting.\n- The soundtrack is quite nice featuring a repertoire of piano pieces. You can chose what song plays in the background as well once  you have it unlocked.\n- Your actions really do shape the story, dialogue choices aren't just there for the sake of multiple options.\n- The story becomes engrossing as you progress.\n- Save system/skip system means you can explore all the possible endings with little hassle.\n- The choice of vocabulary or diction is easy to follow.\n- It's free.\n\nCons:\n- You will have to read, no two ways about it. If you aren't into reading this game may not be for you.\n- Some images and sections may contain mature subject matter that may be inapropriate for younger audiences.\n\nWould I recommend this game?\n\nIt's a good read with an interesting story and characters that aren't static.

I don't play that many visual novels but this one will surely go down as one of my favorites. If you're someone who isn't used to visual novels, this might be a tough choice to start with, but if you get invested into it, you will not stop playing it.\n\n\nSo onto the short review.\n\n\nThe story is amazing. It's really well thought out and it's a story where you really want to keep reading to see what happens next. Some visual novels are usually hard to get through some parts, but this one is not like that at all. It has this dark/creepy vibe to it, which I love and it makes it really mysterious and interesting.\nThe characters are relatable when you learn about their stories and what they are trying to overcome.\n\nIn conclusion I would give this game a solid 10/10 and I would highly recommend it for anyone looking at storylines with a lot of depth.\nThey should seriously add a price tag to this game, I would pay top dollah for this, it's that good *.*\n\n\nStory 10/10\n(Amazing storyline)\n\nSoundtrack 10/10\n(Creates the perfect environment while playing the game)\n\nAnimation/Cinematics 10/10\n(It's what you'd expect for a visual novel made nowadays.

All the good visual novels come from Lemma Soft forums and not even quarter of them make it on Steam. It's been a while since I've played something new. It was a unique experience. It reminded me once again why I still love visual novels. Not the Sakura Spirit kind of visual novels that keep sucking your wallet and brain cells dry, or like Seduce Me the Otome that is merely an erotic fanfic for girls that haven't hit puberty yet (I wouldn't even call it a visual novel). I'm talking about the real quality here. Cupid only sounds cute but don't be fooled by the name. Have you ever wondered if that cheesy angelic kid isn't as pure and adorable as he's portrayed? The cupid is a hunter and he's not afraid to use his bow so he could feed on your poor hearts when the time is ripe. It's true that love has different faces. It's only pure in a certain relationship (mother and son, for instance). Still amazes me how one is able to love another without asking for something in return. And then there's a dark side of the moon. There can't be love without hate. The game shows you how twisted love can be and how fragile humans are. You can be the healthiest person around and with time you start asking what is happening to you. Your own mind, your own thoughts, words and actions seem so foreign. It's easy to go insane and yet it takes time. It's hardly noticable, too.\n\nYou play the Mother, you are behind the scenes. You're just a shapeless memory, still staying with your daughter throughout her existence to keep her on the right/wrong (whatever you choose) track. The daughter doesn't question you because she believes Mother knows best.\n\nThe whole story was remarkably well written. The music is amazing and the ambience is simply fantastic. Interesting characters and awesome artwork. The artwork is rather realistic.\n\nReally enjoyed getting all the endings and then checking out the bonus. Guilleme is such a queen! Gotta love his colorful diary.\nI will definitely play Who is Mike next. Also, thanks for recommending tinytim12 "I think my head is Darkness" vn. I'll check it out.

It has multiple endings, so I'm probably going to have to play it a few more times, which actually sounds fun to me, even though I don't normally like replaying stuff.

This VN is great for people who love basic, but story-rich visual entertainment.\n\nI had a go at another visual novel before trying this one, and I wasn't impressed - especially since further gameplay required paying (which Cupid does not!).\n\nAnd Cupid is anything but cliché! This VN is filled with all sorts of twisted elements.\n\nIt is loaded with darkness, mystery, intensity & intrigue, yum!\n\nThe story deals with various themes such as; submission/domination, distortion/paranoia/psychosis, emotional manipulation/seduction/incest & different types of love (for better ... or worse).\n\nThe characters are laced with feelings of guilt, shame, inadequacy/unworthiness, abandonment fear & fear of intimacy, volatility, as well as obsessive & insatiable desire!\n\nIn a way it's very sick & deranged, but also very alluring & rather hot! Cupid is not your typical erotic thriller. It is bizarre & otherworldy (and quite the mind****).\n\nThis VN swings from one extreme to the other - in an instant! - like a wiiiild pendulum. Uff!\n\nIt sure as heck had me stuck to my chair, all tense and absorbed by the story (which I thought was really well delivered - bit, by bit).\n\nEven though some parts felt a bit drab & long-winded, there was always enough suspense & batsh*t crazy content right around the corner to keep me going for sure!\n\nIt is definitely different from what I've seen so far in the VN-genre, and I consider it a definite must-have both for lovers & newbies (or if you're curious, but unsure - go ahead and try it). You might be pleasantly surprised!\n\nI got ending number 3 (= potentially incestuous) when I finished the story (there's a total of 4 + bonus content to unlock).\n\nI'm so grateful the developers chose to offer this VN for free - I enjoyed it so much I wouldn't mind donating or paying for (optional!) downloadable content (like artwork or soundtracks).\n\nWhich brings me to the endearing & enticing visual aspect & the eerie (but very effective) sound effects which grabbed & held my attention at the right time :)!\n\nI found the music very touching as well. It evoked all sorts of emotions in me (which I appreciated).\n\nAnimation-wise, Cupid is pretty basic (i.e. limited expressions, but good enough!). It does the job.\n\nI loved the addition of animated, flashing stills during gameplay. I found that very captivating & titillating. Most definitely tickled my senses & imagination (in a good way).\n\nOn a final note, I found the story interesting, with more than sufficient content delivered (i.e. characters, text & scenery).\n\nI especially appreciated how the content was delivered in an elegant way and was in no way vulgar (i.e. both artwork & script).\n\nI wouldn't mind more of this!","March 5","true","4.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Second the game is not buggy or suffer from a terrible, unreadable translation issues.

Our main character has suffered quite a bit due to some unknown curse she has. She finds hope returning to her a party hosted by a young aristocrat in town. Little does she know what she is in for at this party.\n\nThe game revolves on the idea of a human cupid and the issues of love. This is far from a happy and bubbly love story.

I was however bitterly disappointed.\nCupid, has some excellent production values, the sound is fantastic and the artwork is polished and skilled.\nThe writing however is atrocious.\n\nNot only does it suffer from consistently poor grammar, and inability to create inflection or tone in it's characters, but the general style is poorly executed.\n\nThe content is also appalling. The character's are simplified and stereotypical, whilst it is one thing to utilize generally expected tropes, the "sensationalist" approach that the authors have attempted to take is crude and brusque. There is very little nuance or depth, and the plot is primarily event driven, skipping from one sensationalistic scene to the next. Character's reactions are briefly portrayed except for a lot of lengthy exposition at the end that is banal, reiterative and demeans the audience by not allowing them to explore and come to their own conclusions about the game. There is an evident lack of subtlety throughout, which is generally an important component of "Gothic" aesthetics. Something the developers entirely overlooked.\nMultiple endings are added, so at least in this the author/s have spent time developing multiple arcs, and the game does boast a deal of consequence (which is actually quite unusual, as most games do tend to only allow the progression of side-arcs, but Cupid did effectively create multiple endings).\n\nAs for the other "gothic" elements that are added to the game, tend towards superficiality. There is little of the true psychological horror or supernatural forces of Edgar Allan Poe, Henry James's Turn of the Screw or even Ann Radcliffe. Instead the game opts to devolve the supernatural elements and traumatic events into sensationalistic scenes, more there for the audiences shock and titillation than for actual development of either plot or characters. (Characters coughing up nails due to a spell gone awry or incestous relationships) The game is also highly gratuitous with little regard actually paid to the effect of the scenes, or even the mechanics (the "badges" the game offers are actually the first indication of this, one I completely missed).\nWhilst this may attract an immature audience, giggling over the risque elements, it doesn't really actually add much to the game, which is a pity as it had the possibility of doing so (ala Wolf Among Us's little story that was revealed through the meta-game badges, telling a new unique story).\nThere are some truly outstanding parts to this game, but it is seriously flawed in other areas, and requires far greater maturity before it decides to slap on an age restriction. Maturity does not lie in ESRB/PEGI ratings or in sexually explicit "smut" but rather in the approaches and world views of the characters. Cupid offers superficial nonsense about love, lust and loneliness that is merely posturing as maturity.","March 10","false","1.4"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","16","31","0","0"

This is made especially so with the fact that its free. I managed to get one ending with two hours of play so if you go for every possibility you are looking at a good deal of time to do all types of playthroughs.\n\nThe story itself feels unique and meaningful compared to a lot of VNs, you wont just find a ton of fan service here "just because", and the twist and turns the story took in my playthrough were all pretty enjoyable and unexpected. The art, stood out to me as well, while its not necessarily unique it was a much higher quality than I have come to expect in free VN games, not to mention the music was just as good!\n\nI am not going to try to describe the story here in detail, but there are ample helpings of love, betrayal and psychosis to go around, sometimes for the better.

To clarify: the game is not gonna suffer from this review, especially since it's free.\nI really believe that this game deserves a chance from most VN fans and if you have a few hours to kill, I can easily suggest that you give it a try, your money won't be wasted, trust me! Your time, however...well, that depends.\nI'll mention the issues first so we can end on a positive note.\n\nCons:\n- The game is linear. When not considering the endings, the rest of the game has a very straight path, I would have liked a little more branching during the story line,  nothing major just that some events were a little more varied.\n- Some characters are not sympathetic. You're given little reason to like them or care what happens to them, outside of some rather cliché attributes. If anything you almost cheer if someone dies. *cough*Guilleme*cough*.\n- The ending is not a natural conclusion. This ties in with the linearity, there is not enough of a change throughout the story to justify the final 'snap' in the protagonist's personality one way or the other, it's just too sudden.\n- The game's text/choice ratio is off. There are huge parts of nothing but reading then huge parts with a lot of choices and that throws off the balance as if they suddenly remembered, 'oh, right, the player!'.\n- The endings. This is a personal gripe with 'hidden', 'true', 'secret', etc. It bugs me when an ending can only be reached if you play the game so and so many times, with no in-game reason for WHY.\n- The genre. This is nitpicking, I know, but this kind of game is just not an RPG, there's too little agency. I know that technically EVERY game is an RPG but for people who assign a certain meaning to that genre, this just doesn't cut it.\n\nPros:\n- The story. In itself it's interesting, it's dark and psychological and I wanted to know what happened next.\n- The naughty bits. They are very well written and despite what some say I found that they fit in the context.\n- The endings. Extremely varied and take a lot of choices into consideration and it's interesting to try out the extremes.\n- Dark theme, The dark parts are well explored and the overall setting never strays from its ominous and mysterious path.\n- Rosa. You do care about her plight and how hard she's trying and there is a certain feeling of 'poor girl' while playing.\n- Originality. Playing mother's voice who tries to influence her daughter is a very intriguing prospect, and even though there isn't always a satisfying response, that sometimes really works in the game's favor as you find that your influence isn't as rooted as you thought.\n\nIn conclusion: The game is definitely worth the price tag and if you have an afternoon with nothing else to do, it's at the very least interesting pass time. It won't be good to everyone but if you're a VN fan, you're no worse off for giving it a try.","March 26","false","5.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I wasn’t expecting much at first but - oh boy! -  in the end I was really impressed.\n\nIf you are into dark mysterious themes and you have no problem with reading a lot, then you should definitely try this! The game is free so you have nothing to lose.\n\nI really enjoyed the plot. It has some twisted elements. On top of that: By replaying the game and choosing different dialogue options you can reveal more secrets about the characters and alter the scenes (especially the endings).\n\nThe long dialogues never bothered me. I even couldn’t stop playing until I unlocked every ending (there are 4 regular ones and 1 secret ending). The story is deep and you can’t wait to see what happens next. Did you choose the right answers…?\n\nYes, this VN has some mature and creepy scenes. So if you are sensitive you might use the mature filter or just don’t play it at all. But I can assure you: There is no r.a.p.e.\n\nNot every achievement is working currently but I’m sure there will be a patch soon.\n\nI can only recommend this VN to everyone who is still interested after reading this.

As far as gameplay i mean its a visual novel so there isnt any, the story is ok the art is fine enough and the music works with the situations. The real problem is you dont care about the characters and the choices you make during the game don't make you feel  like you impacted the story line at all it just takes your imput and goes "ok thanks for your feelings on the situation but were going to countinue our predeterminded story" if your going to put choices in the game they need to feel important or your better off not having them at all. I did however like the idea of being the crazy mom telling my child to do my bidding but again you never feel like your effecting the outcome becuase the choices you make and the convesations that follow don't seem to mesh very well.\n\nSo all in all i would not recommend this game to anyone i know unless i knew they loved this type of media but it's free and a solid effort so i give it a 6.5/10 on visual novel scale.","March 6","false","3.0"," 16 of 35 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","16","35","0","0"

I have no preferences towards this genre.\nSome words about the game. Free or not, reviewing this I still can say that this is a twisted supernatural story which makes you read a lot of rather short conversations always following up with two different choices as you play "the mother".\nThe "novel" pretends to be about emotions and feelings and to question affection, love, desire etc. and also dealing with mental disease. Well, in fact it is just a twisted phantasy some people enjoy. There is no deep story, no real writing to be seen here. There is no reason to care for the characters - in my opinion - and I didn't enjoy this experience as there is nothing to take away from it. All in all, it wasn't worth my time playing through this and I guess it's not worth seeing the different endings as there is no real logic or thought in the game's design behind the choices you make.\nPS: The mature elements included (sexuality, violence etc.) are not really necessary in the way presented. It's just a way to draw more attention to this VN. Just because you include these elements doesn't make the content "mature" in a true sense. It's an immature way of showing mature themes.","March 24","false","3.5"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"

As Conan the Destroyer would drunkenly say: "Not on your knife!"\n\nThis game has much "mature imagery/blood/gore/nudity" as an ACE VENTURA movie.\n\n"Mature content" is more about the paltry few bits of text where it says like one time, about mouth to nipple, and thrusting. What an embarassment to claim the game has A,B,C,D,E,F,G of "mature" types of content only to have nothing more than a PG-rated 1980s movie would have. (*LOL!*)\n\nThat's about it. Totally overrated and overhyped about the "mature" factor to gain attention.\n\nDuke Nukem Forever had 20X more mature content than this "clickbait".\n\nYou'll click FOREVER thru meaningless dialogue to get to the ACTUAL meat of the story and it's so terribly unrewarding. One factor to this is the lack of the so-called "shock" "mature" stuff.\nBut the other is just the huge lack of anything interesting going on in the story.\n\nEverything is about "20 lines" too long of dialogue that clouds and detracts from anything interesting in the story.\n\nLike a movie where each scene feels uncomfortably 30-seconds longer than it needs to actually be.\n\nI guess rather than put out anything mature, the developers added a few lines of text and claimed this game technically has horror, gore, boobs, butt, nudity because "in your mind when you read certain lines of text, which are like 1 out of 1000, it will make you think of it, so technically it's true".\n\n0/10 - you'll tire your finger out clicking through the plethora of meaningless story banter and boring text and laughbably overhyped PG-rated content, that you won't have any strength left to fap yourself (or to please your gal).","March 27","false","2.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

But usually when I try them I just go "meh" or "ok". This one is just boring though. You can already guess what's going on since the beginning so all the mystery is pointless. You play as "mother", a voice in the protag's head. It may be original but imo it made it harder to get involved. Your choices barely impact the gameplay at all until the end. And I did google the endings, to get the secret ending and ending 1 you have to do others and the differences are "subtle", so just the idea to replaying it for them all feels like a chore, even with the fastforward button.","March 5","false","2.0"," 8 of 29 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","8","29","0","0"

You’re playing as Rosa’s mother who is just a voice subconsciously telling her daughter how she should live her life. This being through the expectations of religious belief. I can’t say too much without spoiling it though.\n\nI’m really surprised how in depth every character was. Usually in visual novels the side characters aren’t very complexed as the main. Every single of one them had an actual purpose for being placed in the story. It’s also very artistc. The transitions of words and pictures help furthar the message of what they want the reader to get out of it. Which is nice because sometimes when you read text. People can interp it in many different ways.\n\nHowever, there was one thing that did bother me. I honestly do not like how the main plot is handed to you. Then they go into the past to show you the previous events which led up to that point. For me personally I think a build up would have been way better. To me they should have only been done with the pieces of Rosa past.\n\n\nI recommended this as a starter for people who want to get into visual novels.

One of the better VNs that isn't a Dating Sim. If those are good to begin with is a different story... they can be but often they are not.\n\nBut since I am guessing that whoever is reading this is looking for opinions, here's mine:\n\nI won't be the first one to point this out (at least I would think so) but this VN reminded me a lot of "Interview with a Vampire" and that's not just because of the Renaissance setting. I like that one and after completing CUPID it comes with little surprise that I'm thinking positive about it.\n\nThe plot jumps back and forth in its timeline which I didn't like at first because it is confusing and little makes sense but the picture comes together as the chapters pass. Now I think it is fine. I also like how the player doesn't decide what the main character is going to do/say - at least not directly.\n\nMost of the CGs are beautiful, like the ones shown but not all of the game is looking that nice, so the Store page is a bit lying about that. I can tell though the devs put effort into facial expressions as they change with almost every line of text, this is "compensated" with a serious lack of poses. The soundtrack, a mixture of ambient, technospheric (I just made that one up) and classical stuff, has some good tunes.\n\nStory itself is written extensively at times and detailed whenever critical events happen, with a sophisticated word thrown in every now and then, as one would hope to see when looking for something exciting and new. Reading the whole thing once without skipping anything takes about 5 hours.\n\nThe grande finale, once it unfolds and the decisions to be made, when the secrets are reveiled, is where the story has its peak, and I admit: I did not see the "outings" coming and they turned the plot into a whole different direction, so don't think you've already figured it out, once you got an idea, I was on my toes when coming up with theories of what might have happened to the characters since there's tragedy involded. The fact that the plot jumps, as mentioned earlier, didn't help since you get to see the results before "it" even happens.\n\n8/10 would stab lovesucking vampire to death again.","March 20","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, off the bat I can say that as a writer, and avid literature enthusiast, I was curious how much depth and substance a visual novel on Steam would be. But MAN was I glad to see this VN.\n\nI'm not going to leave an incredibly lengthy review, but I find this VN incredibly appealing. The Mature Filter is an interesting and nice touch, (I played through with it off, but it's cool that there's a toned down option just in case.) and the characters and story had a surprising amount of depth and intrigue. After the first chapter, I found myself continually invested in learning where the story and characters would go, and there were quite a few times where I found myself genuinely surprised by the paths the story went.\n\nEven more appealing is the fact that the VN gives you several paths to take, and gives it legitimate reply value. As I have far from finished all the paths, I find myself excited to sit down and go through it again already; however it will have to wait until another day.\n\nIf you're interested in the drama, with some very dark and curious twists to the storyline and characters alike, then I'd definitely suggest downloading Cupid.

The artwork however was a bit of a turn off, when characters have converstations both their pictures are drawn standing side by side lookig straight at the player, which i felt removed me from the experience somewhat. It would have been better to vary it up like they occasionally did for certain scenes, i know this means the animation would have suffered but i'd be more inclined to pay for it if they did this.\n\nThe story itself is an interesting one with several interesting characters, but it feels more complex than needs be, not that the story is hard to follow, just that there are several points the story sets up that have no relevance or purpose later. i think they may have been used if i had made other choices but ive only played through once.\n\nspeaking of the choices you make as the mother, most of them hold no weight and just produce slightly varied dialogue options, so its not always clear if it will make a huge diffence to your ending when making a choice.\n\nthe themes the story bring across are powerful but did sometimes go back on themselves, but you may intereprete them differently so i wont say too much abouyt that.\n\nThe saving grace for this game, and really the one thing that made me give this a thumbs up is the sound design and certain annimation cues that, when used together, shift the tone and mood of the story so drastically its scary! this happens a lot as well and everytime it did i felt literal nerves. this story can play with your emotions so well that it enthralled someone like me who usually steers clear of these sorts of titles.\n\nPlus its free so why not            7/10","March 30","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's worlds better than some games that I've paid $30+ for and I didn't have to spend a dime on it.  Almost enough to make a person feel guilty.\n\nAlthough love is the overall theme, what really sucked me in initially was the suspense and feeling of slow creeping terror.  The atmosphere is wonderful -- writing and art are not perfect but almost always great, and what more can you ask from a free game?  They work together to do an excellent job of building tone, creating a sense of gradual mounting tension, and really evoking the feeling of a whole world with a few static images.\n\nI got ending 3 the first time through despite doing my very best to make nice decisions, and once I'd finished reading that I felt like I needed a bath, in the best possible way.  There they were, this character doing something unequivocably evil, and yet in a certain sense I couldn't even blame them for it.  I was sucked in by the perversity and the mystery of it all and immediately had to dive back in for more.\n\nIf I were to voice any criticisms, they would mainly be:\n\n1) From the author's notes bonus I gather that the main writer assumes the meaning of the title "Cupid" would be obvious once you've finished the endings, but I was reading that with four endings under my belt and the idea hadn't even occurred to me in the slightest.  I assumed it was supposed to be more of a general reference to love and matchmaking.  If this was an idea the team wanted to convey to readers or thought was important, I think they unfortunately did a poor job.\n\n2) The summary blurb for the game in the Steam Store pushes the idea of the player directly stepping into the role of Mother, but this is very misleading.  "Mother" is very much a specific character of her own with a specific personality, goals, etc. that you the player do not get to affect very much.  One of my big pet peeves in visual novels and text adventures is when you get presented with "false choices" where nothing is available on your list of options that's remotely like what you actually want to say.  This game had some fairly egregrious examples of that, particularly being forced to be mean to Rosa and then having the game chide me for my bad attitude in one ending even though, given the option, I would never have said any of those mean things at all.  This irritating problem could have been avoided by finding some way to include Mother that didn't require her to be the POV character.\n\nOverall however, these are small issues at the end of the day.  This game would be well worth your time at $20 or $30, let alone at the price of totally free.  Go check it out.","March 28","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First going into the game I was very confused on who I actually was or what was even going on but as the pieces came together I got further into the story. I in time found it very interesting that the role you get to play, getting to be the person who clouds the judgement and thoughts of someone else, I feel is very unique and something I don't think I've ever seen in a visual novel. I enjoyed each character and getting to see them grow and getting to learn so much unexpected things from each one and seeing them in their darkest times. I found the story to be very emotional and at times had me in tears..(probably because I chose wrong choices xD)..the story line of this story being te 1700's centered in France, it's either one you'll love or you'll hate depending if you like more modernized visual novels or older ones. I for one loved the setting and time period this game presented in and actually have been looking for visual novels of a different time period. I also must say the artwork for this game I absolutely adore, from character designs to their outfits too (I enjoyed actually getting to see the characters design change over periods of time thats another thing you dont see in most visual novels, for me it was nice seeing a character not have to wear the same thing for 10+ years xD). Though at times the art can look a tad cringey because of the such the dark..little bit wobbly looking lines outlining the character fully, and it kind of doesnt fit with the sharpened and perfected backgrounds of the game that appeared to be made with some 3d program probably but its both definitely overshadowed by the beautiful colouring in this game. I wont give anything away story-wise, but I wil say that in my first play through I have received ending 2, and it definitely makes me want to play more to choose differently to see all the the different outcomes. So, do I recommend this game? Yes. It was very enjoyable with lovely characters and a very deep and heart breaking (at times) story. Games like these make me want to make visual novels of my own, so bravo creators, this game was indeed enjoyed. :3","May 21","true","31.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I noticed a few typos, but nothing huge. The sound design is pretty awesome and the looping of songs/background effects is pretty much on point.\n\nIt's not your typical dumb visual novel, so check it out.","May 12","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good enough that they could, and probably should've, put a price on it.\n\nPros:\n-Nicely fleshed out, original story line. Your first play through will be solid and interesting. This to me is the most important part of a visual novel.  And it has a lot to offer. Nice character development, humorous dialouge, dark tone, likeable characters, situations they are not too obvious, and yes, a bit of erotica too... Its good. Just really well carved-out.\n-The director's bonus material (unlocked upon completing different endings) is as amusing as the novel, and gives you an even better appreciation for the work that goes into making these things.\n\nNeutral:\n-You play the voice of Rosa's mother; the choices you pick influence her actions. Its an interesting concept. I was by no means enamored with this, but it didn't bother me either.\n-Not a dating sim. A lot of VNs are about which lover you choose--this is not like that at all.\n\nCons:\n-The art isn't anything too special. There are moments when its really lovely, but it seems kinda like the artist put all their energy into about five things, and then threw everything else together last minute.\n-Replay-ablity is weak. The story line doesn't really change ever--the endings are just very based upon how much information Rosa gathers throughout the story (or fails to gather) and her attitude towards her mother (you). The games' secrets aren't that hard to gather, so in all likelyhood you will get a realitively complete ending. Every playthrough after that feels kinda dull.\n\nI think my first playthrough was around 2.5 hours? I can't recall exactly.","May 15","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am very impressed with this VN. It's not your typical cute and romantic VN, for sure. It has an eerie vibe and atmosphere, almost freaky. But, like, good freaky. I can't believe this VN is free. I can tell it took a whole lot of effort and time (2007 really~?) to make it this good, epically with the music, art, and story. Major props to Fervent (developer). I've only finished one play through and only completed 35% of it.\n\nStoryline: In the VN, you play as a mother, who's only real in your daughter's (Rosa) consciousness. As Rosa continues on with her (self-proclaimed) sinful life, she meets Catherine and Guilleme. Ever since then, her life has become more complicated. As her mother, you will give her guidance. Note: There will be no happy endings. Just sad, scary, evil, and shocking turn of events.\n\nPlaytime: Took me ~6 hours for a single play through, and another 2-3 hrs if you want to unlock all the achievements and dialogues.\nAudience: This is rated mature. So 17+ (?) btw i'm a female and i enjoyed it, not sure about guys.\nGenres: Romance, Suspense, Thriller, Mystery, Historical Fiction, Family\n\nPros:\n+ Music, art, and storyline are just stunning\n+ Lots of achievements to get\n+ Still can't believe it's free\n+ Unexpected plot twists, I still can’t believe it. I was hoping for romance. But, not that kind of love. Still amazing though.\n+ Barely any fillers, almost every scene contributed to the major plot\n+ Visible character progression\n+ It gets interesting every chapter\n\nCons:\n- I still want to know what happened to Rosa's life afterwards or how she got that scar on her eye :( (Maybe a second part? )\n- The chronological order of the scenes may be confusing to some\n- Cliff-hanger or not? Hmm not sure...\n\nOverall, I was completely immersed in this VN. I just couldn't stop reading. Thanks for the amazing work you have done.  And keep it up! =D\nP.S. A cupid who's a playboy, how ironic. Lol. btw, this VN reminds me of Katy Perry's song "E.T." for some reason... >.>","April 8","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First going into the game I was very confused on who I actually was or what was even going on but as the pieces came together I got further into the story. I in time found it very interesting that the role you get to play, getting to be the person who clouds the judgement and thoughts of someone else, I feel is very unique and something I don't think I've ever seen in a visual novel. I enjoyed each character and getting to see them grow and getting to learn so much unexpected things from each one and seeing them in their darkest times. I found the story to be very emotional and at times had me in tears..(probably because I chose wrong choices xD)..the story line of this story being te 1700's centered in France, it's either one you'll love or you'll hate depending if you like more modernized visual novels or older ones. I for one loved the setting and time period this game presented in and actually have been looking for visual novels of a different time period. I also must say the artwork for this game I absolutely adore, from character designs to their outfits too (I enjoyed actually getting to see the characters design change over periods of time thats another thing you dont see in most visual novels, for me it was nice seeing a character not have to wear the same thing for 10+ years xD). Though at times the art can look a tad cringey because of the such the dark..little bit wobbly looking lines outlining the character fully, and it kind of doesnt fit with the sharpened and perfected backgrounds of the game that appeared to be made with some 3d program probably but its both definitely overshadowed by the beautiful colouring in this game. I wont give anything away story-wise, but I wil say that in my first play through I have received ending 2, and it definitely makes me want to play more to choose differently to see all the the different outcomes. So, do I recommend this game? Yes. It was very enjoyable with lovely characters and a very deep and heart breaking (at times) story. Games like these make me want to make visual novels of my own, so bravo creators, this game was indeed enjoyed. :3","May 21","true","31.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story was great, the characters are thought-out and drawn nicely, so many different endings, and the need for all the achivements is strong.
