Being able to try the development version when touring Schell Games last November is what convinced me that the Vive was worth buying.\n\nWater Bears takes a classic puzzle game and turns it into an incredible experience. The relaxing atmosphere and music combined with the most immersive controls out of any game I've tried so far make this a must-have Vive game.

The VR environment is wonderfully bright and colorful, don't let the cartoony-style fool you, this game is immersive. The puzzles are fun and there are enough things to warrant the $9.99 USD.\n\nThe game most closely resembles Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker in terms of the action being centered around a winding blocky mountain you have to traverse around. With the added VR it makes Water Bears VR entertaining and not invasive, a really good place to start with VR.\n\nThe puzzle difficulty is quite basic at first and then starts to ramp up with different pipe types and needing to mix colors together for certain Water Bears.\n\nThe biggest downfall of the game is its 3m x 3m room requirement. I didn't have enough room (about 2.6m x 2.8) and it still worked just fine so I'm not sure what the need for all that space is (you don't even use most of the edge space).\n\n\nPros    Great aesthetics to experience in VR\nFun puzzles akin to Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker\nCute interactions with the Water Bears gives added VR depth.\nGreat price point of $9.99 USD\nPerfect for demoing VR in a non-invasive and interactive way.\n\nCons    3m x 3m room size requirement (I wable able to play with less)\nLack of passive interaction with the enviroment.\n\nAll in all I'd say this is a must-have VR experience.","April 6","true","0.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

There are only 4 stages, with a bunch of levels that get progressively harder (but none of them were very difficult) and a few challenge levels for each stage, which I was able to complete in slightly under an hour.\n\nI was able to play it in a 2.5m x 1.5m space, although it probably would work in a 2m x 1.5m space as well. 1.5m was very slightly too narrow for some levels, so I'd recommend a minimum of 2m x 2m.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun game to demo to others, Water Bears VR is a good pick.","April 17","true","0.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/duranteA/recommended/394130/","duranteA","Durante","http://steamcommunity.com/id/duranteA/","630 products in account","I completed it yesterday, and it really surprised me. Primarily by being perhaps the single most polished complete game on the Vive. This includes everything from menu interactions, over the rendering image quality which is some of the best I've seen in the Vive, to the way interactions with everything feel. To give you an example of the latter, you can throw pieces of the puzzle into the water, and the make a satisfying splash when they land, both aurally and visually. There's absolutely no need to support that and it has nothing to do with the main gameplay, but it's still handled gracefully. Another example is how you can pick up and interact with the "Water Bears" (whatever those are) after completing a level.\n\nThe biggest issue with the game and the only one I can really identify is that I wish there was more of it (it features ~50 levels), and that the puzzles ramped up in difficulty more quickly.\n\nAnyway, if you want a relaxing and very polished game to play in VR in between hectic sessions of Holopoint or Audiosurf I highly recommend it. I guess the biggest compliment I can make it is that I'd instantly buy a DLC level pack for it.","April 23","true","2.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I have to say this was the first VR game among the 40+ I had that I really wanted to come back to and finish. In total it took 1.8 hours more or less, it includes some short demo time for friends.\n\nDifficulty: The game itself is quite varied and goes from super simple to mind twistingly hard at the final challenge levels.\n\nVR Implementation: I imagine it was fun even on a screen, but in VR it just works perfectly. You move around the entire level, place pipes in 3D, watch the seemingly volumetric fluid flow. All interface parts are moved into world space and works really well, the water bears can be interacted with using your controllers, there is nice coherent graphical style making the world believable, it runs without issues on a rec spec system.\n\nValue: I usually compare game times to a movie ticket. If I get 1.5-2.5 hours of quality entertainment for €10-15, I'm happy. Then I'm one of those people who jump between many games, but to me it makes sense. For this game I am happy I got it and played it, no regrets :) I will probably not replay it, but that's fine by me, it's usually how puzzle games work.\n\nConclusion: I thought this game would just be something I'd try and forget about, but it has become the first consumer VR game I finish. In my eyes definitely worth a look if you want some well executed and quite fulfilling VR puzzle gaming :)","April 18","true","2.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is easily one of the most polished VR games for the Vive right now. Today was the first time I played it, as many of the other free Vive games have been terrible, but this was grade A stuff.\n\nThe world is really solid, everything is polished and there are no rough edges. The gameplay (fixing tubes together to get the right colour water to the cute little bears) starts of simple and fun and soon expands into some more thoughtful gameplay.\n\nCompared to Space Pirate Trainer, Holoball, Audioshield (all of which I love) this game feels so much fuller, like a true game is here as opposed to a quick arcade blast. For 10 bucks it's a bargain, and I would recommend it to any adult or kid alike.","May 8","true","1.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However Water Bears VR functions well not only as a puzzle game, but as a fantastic prototype for VR game design.\n\nFirst, the game menu and inventory are controlled from a handheld pop-up that is dimissed or traded between hands with a single button. The opposing hand interacts with this menu like a touchscreen display. If there was anything I dislike about non VR games, it is the inability to break away from keyboard bindings. Having a menu that can be summoned and interacted with intuitively makes using the menus themselves fun.\n\nLevels maximize use of small standing area and don't needlessly complicate puzzle layouts to take advantage of all available play space. I use a smaller than recommended play area which honestly isn't super critical for this game to begin with. Being able to move around a static puzzle without bumping into a desk is a plus.\n\nThe cartoonish textures are well crafted and are suited for the Vive. Despite the cartoonish nature, however, there is a definite sense of presence for objects. So much so, I would often travel around the puzzles or move my hands over or under walls, subconsciously feeling they were actually in my way. The environment feels alive and open with little animation. The background isn't needlessly busy and makes itself known without being distracting.\n\nThen there's the little things: Little waterwheels in the controllers, the water bears following you around or giggling at being touched, even the way the triggers are animated 1:1 despite having no function until fully pressed.\n\nThis game is well polished and has a few surprises in way of puzzles. It was honestly more than what I was expecting when I bought it.","June 1","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
