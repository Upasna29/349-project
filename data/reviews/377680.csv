"http://steamcommunity.com/id/azusa_twin/recommended/377680/","azusa_twin","ティアラ μ's","http://steamcommunity.com/id/azusa_twin/","244 products in account","Sakura Beach a short visual novel that has a slice of life feeling to it developed by Winged Cloud giving players choices to make which will affect the outcome at the end will take around 2-3 hours to complete 1 readthrough.\n\nThe Story The game starts of with the protagonist named Seiji a space fanatic daydreaming about the universe in the lobby of a hotel to be only snapped out of it by 1 of his childhood friend.\nWhile on a vacation for a week to the beach with his two chilhood friends, all he ever thought was to take out his telescope and look at the stars. But during the course of the week the protaganist gradually, begins to realise that his childhood friends want him to pay attention to them instead of constellations...\n\nA note: There is yuri content in it and its really pleasing to the eye to but the yuri scenes feels a little out of place but do not let this stop you from getting this VN.\n\nAudio and Visual elements  For the visual elements, i will spilt it into 2 sections because there is 2 very distinctive art style mixed in it. The background art and characther art.\n\nBACKGROUND art  - I find it beautiful as there are hints of pastel colour paintings used in the backgrounds which i find it unique.\nCHARACTHER art  - 1 thing you would surely realise is that the design of the characther are differnt from the other sakura games which i find it good as it gives a fresh new look to the characthers.\n\nAs for the AUDIO, it manages to set the mood for every situation, depicting the environment of playfulness or seriousness when it needs to do so. Nothing too fancy here.\n\nTo sum up, I would recommend this visual novel to people who want something short and fans of the sakura series and fans of the genre Yuri and romance. But don't expect too much because it will take you just 2-3 hours to complete the whole visual novel.\n\nClick here for full review![azusantiara.wordpress.com]","August 14, 2015","true","24.0"," 417 of 492 people (85%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","85","417","492","36","30"

He's a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥, and it's completely out of my control what he does. I thought I was buying a game here, where I get to choose what happens. Nope, this is not a game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KillerPizzaGuy/recommended/377680/","KillerPizzaGuy","KillerPizzaGuy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KillerPizzaGuy/","47 products in account","I'm honestly not so sure what to think about this game. The beginning seemed rather fine, except for the fact that the UI for the main menu was actually rather scrubbed clean. Which in turn would tell me that the game didn't have too much effort put into it. That's basically what the experience is. The entire plot feels taped together body parts of many japanese comedy-romance tropes that it seems too predictable. It's extremely linear, or bi-linear, as you have to pick and choose sides between the two women, or two unaged girls I honestly can't tell the difference.\n\nBut as stated before by other people you don't get many choices at begin with. You could feel that who ever was forced to make this didn't give a toss when you see two large options on your screen for the first time. You would've probably had a sense of relief that it would have remembered that it's supposed to have choices. But after a while it doesn't happen again, and when it does it's the same dual action that favors one girl over the other. I mean I would've wanted more choices so I could intervene a little bit more. Just so I could make this completely annoying protagonist move away from being this awkward 'science nerd' into someone that I would possibly relate too. Yet that just never happened as things continue on and I spam the spacebar through useless word filler.\n\nBut when you do start to read it you do find that it's as cliche as the rotting piles of scum you find on your television that try to take the word cliche and wear it as a hat. Honestly I found myself playing Crossy Road and Fallout Shelter on my smartphone fifteen minutes into the bloody thing. Looking at my computer every now and then like a bored digusted father during a mid life crisis as he looks into a mirror. Yet I don't think I really have to say much of anything else about it. This really does feel like watching the pliot/final episode to a dull tv show. It won't allow me to put much effort into grilling it since there wasn't any effort put into it. So lets at least count up all of the bad things about this anime interactive novel.\n\nOne-Terrile dialogue that would make a public school play writer jealous.\nTwo-An annoyingly thick protagonist that has the cliche short story arch of him needing to learn how to love and cut loose.\nThree-Giving you less options to choose from than a starbucks knockoff.\nFour-Honestly how could anyone be shocked about two girls kissing nowadays? I'm sorry Mr. Protagonist you'll have to start getting with the times since you really sounded like a republician stuck in the streets of San Francisco when you saw your two childhood friend giving each other a snog.\n\nIt'll probably get a pass by people aren't as desensitized to soft core anime sims. As for a few other people that I've seen down in the reviews that also are pointing out the same flaws, or at least some of them. In all this sim feels empty and leaves you as such. Like eating twenty snack sized bag of crisps that are more air than actual crisps... And is ironically priced the same.\n\n\n\n\nI wonder if I should at least put some effort into thinking up a few good things about. I should just put the same effort as who ever made i-","August 17, 2015","false","1.0"," 37 of 45 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","37","45","4","0"

I liked the art style a lot on this one (sprites and CGs were awesome), BG was really good, BGM was nice as usual. The MC, Seiji, is probably the first MC from the Sakura series that caught my attention (I liked the fact that he loves space/science).\n\nThe story… Well… It’s cliche and kinda boring sometimes, I didn’t liked the fact that drama is being pushed on MC all the time. But it’s fine, it’s a fan service game, so you’ll probably buy this because of that. There are two girls, both are pretty and there are a lot of “misunderstandings” where MC accidentally finds them in embarrassing situations.\n\n4/10, I recommend getting this game on a good sale (since it’s quite short and not worth paying the full price in my opinion) and if you are already used to Winged Cloud VNs.","April 21","true","5.1"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","22","23","3","0"

The hotel room images were the nicest.\n\n-Cons-\n-Typos abound.\n- Strange time issues. For example, one girl says they have a few days left on their vacation yet in the next scene they announce tomorrow is their last day. This happens a few times.\n- I didn't like either of the love interests. One is keen on emotional manipulation and the other is big on physical abuse.\n- The song that plays whenever a "hot" photo plays is so flippin' annoying. If you played that to prisoners for twenty-four straight hours, they'd break down and tell you everything you need to know and then end up in psych.\n- The story didn't really pull me in.

I want to believe that all of the cliched/poor dialogue, pandering, and character development is completely intentional and meant to be laughed at in an ironic way, but with the last two Sakura titles attempting to place poorly paced emotional backstories on the central characters I'm not sure how ironic they may actually be. I still got a good number of laughs out of this one, but it does suffer the same issues that Sakura Fantasy had. Ex. Horrible pacing attempting to shove ecchi and emotional scenes back to back (don't get me wrong every time I laugh, but I'm laughing for the wrong reasons), scene's just happen causing the game to feel like it's fulfilling some quota, and the main characters reaction to the "suddenly ecchi" isn't even mildly entertaining falling somewhere between a deadpan "I don't even care anymore" and completely oblivious.\n\nThe art is okay. I can't compare it to the other Sakura titles nor can I compare it to the artist's other works, but I can confidently state that the art is okay. I think I read a comment about giraffe girls in another review and that had me laughing for a bit, but aside from that it really isn't bad just not impressive.\n\nThere are some pretty poor sound tracks in this title. A number of tracks felt like very short loops that started grating on the ears and some just seemed out of place. One track in particular gave off a horror-ey vibe and made me expect something Yandere was about to go down.\n\nOverall I can safely say that if you've gotten a good laugh at the other titles you'll enjoy this one too, but if you're looking for something more than a shallow and possibly ironic/possibly-not shameless ecchi VN then look elsewhere.","October 31, 2015","true","3.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","11","13","4","0"

Seiji\n\nOur MALE protagonist. A dense guy that loves the space more than girls.\n\n2. Ayumi\n\nA classic over-the-roof tsundere girl that always try to act mature. A good cook, and one of the smartest student at school, but has no swimming ability.\n\n3. Momoka\n\nA cheerful and immature girl that loves to tease the MC and make lewd jokes. A complete opposite with Ayumi (terrible cook, bad in study, but extremely good at sports, especially swimming.\n\nThey  brought back a bunch of fan-service scenes that were literally just a copy-paste from Sakura Fantasy (and maybe the whole damn series), and even those scenes were so forced that made me just go "wtf?".\n\nThe story progression can be summarized like this: Seiji, Ayumi and Momoka came to this particular beach-side hotel on their summer holiday. As they were having fun day to day on the beach, the girls tried hard to make Seiji notice their feeling, and also tried to make him confessing the truth behind his obsessed with studying, which they found really unusual. Gradually, Seiji opened up more to them, told them about the thing that he was trying to cover up, his fear, and his true feeling toward his two friends.\n\nMUSIC\n\nAfter 5 minutes of playing, I decided to turn off the music and turn my youtube playlist on. <_<\n\nDo something about your boring music please, Winged Cloud.\n\nPros:\n\n- Decent plot (wait, is this even a pro?)\n\nCons:\n\n- All-over-the-place plot developments\n\n- Cliche fan-service scenes.\n\n- Unexplained details.\n\n- Boring-to-death music.\n\nScore\n\nStory: 5/10.\n\nCharacter: 6/10.\n\nGraphic: 7/10.\n\nMusic: 2/10.\n\nOverall: 6/10.\n\nWould i rate this game?

Probably laugh a lot about that.\nAmazing art.\n\nOn a serious note, I liked it. I mean, i'll be honest and was in it for the bewbies, but there aren't much of those so you'll simply be disappointed. Through the game I came to like the characters, however generic they are. It's a cute, fun enough VN for two hours, and it's not going to change your life, but hey it's good enough for the price.\n\nAnd really, I would have liked it so much more if the tone had been consistent. I know it's anime and anime shifts tone like a racer shifts gears, but there's a scene where the protagonist is trying to be serious, and the two heroines start making out. Not only did it break the tone swimmingly, it was also uncalled for and had no reason. The girls didn't really talk about it very much and they were talking as if they weren't making out.\n\nThe ecchi in this game is random and really misplaced, and is really simply fanservice. There are points in time they don't even bother setting up the ecchi scene and it simply appears from out of thin air.\n\nWhen the game isn't being completely inconsistent, it has nice enough dialogue that'll make you go 'aww', and the romance can be quite sweet. It's nothing too deep and you can see it from a mile away (although the protagonist doesn't seem to), but yeah. It's like, sufficient I guess.\n\nAll in all, I liked Sakura Beach. Really. It was fun, and I would just like to think that the random yuri scenes and outbreaks of ecchi that the game throws at you are simply a metaphor for Seiji's (The protagonist) repressed sexuality, because he's close to these two really hot girls and thinks it's impure to think of them that way, this manifests in his daydreaming getting out of hand and bam! They start making out. Which is probably why they don't really think about it that much. But then again, it's anime, not literature, so I'm probably thinking too much about it.\n\nI hope that was the intention, though, then I wouldn't have to be dissappointed in the game so much.","August 17, 2015","true","2.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Sakura Beach takes a detour from the standard fantasy/imaginative settings that the other Sakura games are known for and puts the player in a natural down to earth setting of a male MC and his 2 child hood friends spending a week vacationing at a beach. The story is general flair of conversations of beach activities , nothing too special,  but a nice underlying background story leading up to a enjoyable conclusion mixed in with music and art makes it worth the read. While few flaws appear such as a couple of typo's, mispellings, really dence MC, and prob the fewest choices of the sakura series yet,  they can be overlooked for an enjoyable short story with rather adorable confessions. For those looking for the fan service, some rather enjoyable scenes implied of beach wear along with some yuri action as well.\n\nOverall an enjoyable experience to go through and I can't wait for the next addition to the Sakura franchise!","August 18, 2015","true","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However as it does not, and this novel really does have some issues, I'm going to have to give it a thumbs down.\n\nSakura beach is the newest (and weakest) installment in the sakura franchise by Winged Cloud. The story takes place with Rene from Infinite Stratos(Ayumi), Kati from Akiba's Trip(Momoko), and the Space Core from Portal 2 (Seiji) all taking a week long vacation to the beach. The story moves along at a steady enough pace, however the scenes are often interrupted by the protagonists unresolved problems. This marked itself as a problem as the plot often went back and forth between a feel-good-beach-romp and then trying to maintain the traditional Sakura formula of having a dangerous situation that requires attention. Except this time the situation is just that Seiji has some abandonment issues rather than being trapped in a spirit world or similar situation.\n\nBetween the game being unsure of what type of story it wants to be, short music loops, and only taking half as long to complete as the other Sakura games, I can't reccomend it despite some nice CGs.","August 18, 2015","false","1.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","1"

My total game time is kinda skewed because I spent a lot of time playing this in the background of other games so it took awhile to complete. Probably could be done in a few hours if you focused on it.\n\nThe problem with it taking a few hours is that there really isn't much that happens in it. It's just heavily padded by characters often repeating the same thing over and over again or your main character being so dumb that he doesn't catch on to incredibly obvious things which makes the game last.\n\nI honestly don't know how many times the characters discuss your MC hiding a secret from them and how they care about him and how he should tell them and your MC thinking "Wow... they must be serious." or times where the character just starts day dreaming about the sky or space or his future. It wouldn't be so bad in a longer game, but when probably 33% of this game is dedicated to the above things, it just slows down the story.\n\nThe two female characters were pretty likeable and the artwork was very good. It was generally pretty good when they weren't trying to lower the tone to make it more serious when he was daydreaming or they were asking about what was making him sad... which honestly didn't turn out to be anything major or something really that was given much of a resolution so it seemed pointless to even have it in it.\n\nFor the price of it, you'll get your money's worth but that's about it.","September 18, 2015","true","13.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I thought that perhaps after the last Sakura game, the writer had learned that characters need some depth for you to care about them, but this was either myself being incredibly positive or the result of said writer being fired and replaced by his dead brother. With Sakura Spirit and Sakura Angels, you thought that a fourteen-year old was writing his first softcore pseudo-pornography and by the time of Sakura Fantasy he had learned that characters need some sort of feelings that don't feel forced to create an emotional connection with the audience. It was wrong of me to think this. It's just pulp fiction. It's a B-movie. It's cheaply made, cranked out and bought by people liking it ironically. There's no way they'd like it for the intended purposes, not when the women are drawn similar to giraffes and have the personality of a lolicon soundboard.\n\nIt's not like the Sakura Visual Novels are incredibly complex, but this is a new low for Winged Cloud. This is the visual novel a computer would create. Just feed it some art assets of busty anime girls and the dialogue to the previous Sakura visual novels and this would be the result. There is nothing unexpected. However, even though no effort was spared for the dialogue or characters, the scenes are quick and dirty. The pacing is similar to a Formula 1 car on a go-kart track. Just overkill. It's only a paragraph into the game and the protagonist is stumbling through doors and generally making an ♥♥♥♥ of himself. If these characters existed in real life, the girls would only let him hang around them out of pity. They certainly wouldn't be too afraid of being ♥♥♥♥♥ by the protagonist as he no doubt has trouble with complicated acts such as removing clothes and moving quickly. In the context of the game however, they're somehow attracted to him. Since they're on holiday and he's being guilt-tripped into moving their luggage upstairs, I can only assume he is extremely rich and he has become their hostage.\n\nThis is being sold for ten US dollars. Ten whole dollars. That could probably feed about forty starving familes, but is instead going towards a  visual novel that doesn't even try. I can only imagine it was either written to test the waters with a new artist, who does a competent job, or to fulfill some sort of financial or product quota. If it's the latter, that's disappointing. In the visual novel scene, you generally feel like even if the dialogue is cheesy, the story is cliched or characters flat, at least the developer made it because it was the cheesy, cliched, flat shlock they wanted to make and they loved making it. You feel like they had fun.\n\nWith Sakura Beach, you don't get the feeling it was made for a love of cheesy stories. It was made because they wanted more money but they didn't feel like putting in so much effort. So this was produced in an afternoon and sent off to the war. Johnny Turk gunned it down, Winged Cloud got their ten dollars and I got post-traumatic stess disorder.","October 15, 2015","false","2.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

Mr. MC is about as dense as it gets (heck, many Harem Anime MCs are quicker to pick up on things O.o) and is completely unable to understand anything romance-related... I would say he has his head in the clouds, but that was already stated by one of the girls, welp.\nThe two main girls are... generic at best: you have the (annoying) Tsundere girl, who insults the MC every time she can, apologizes for that and follows it up with another insult; she also can't swim (even though she's appearently good at sports) and is good at cooking. Even though she shares most of the 'generic Tsundere appearence' she doesn't have Twintails (why that hairstyle is used mainly for Tsunderes is beyond me) and has a... well... rather well evolved chest.\nThe other Girl is the nice/somewhat sadistic girl who's an absolute trainwreck when it comes to cooking (cinnamon Ramen... i wonder how that tastes), is slightly airheaded and rather perverted (in a 'Sakura' Vn... how unusual). The\none thing I DIDN'T expect was the fact that she's supposedly also really good at sports.\nThe main character is... well... lets just say that (except for his love for space) his character traits rarely leave the 'who woulda guessed...' zone.\nNow now, I know that using generic characters is not neccessarily a very bad thing, HOWEVER, when you combine generic characters with every single generic ecchi action known to mankind... the VN feels somewhat lackluster. You have the generic 'walk into room with girl dressing' scene (x2), the generic sunoil scene, the generic Popsicle-eating scene (which actually made me laugh)... you get the idea.\nNow, what about the choices, you ask?? Surely there has to be decent choices. Well... ok, there IS a fair amount of choices, I'll give them that; also there are 2 1/2 arcs I think. The 'tsundere girl' arc, the 'Momoko' arc and a 'Harem'-Sub-arc for both of them. However, I have only read one of the arcs and yet I'm only missing one CG, so I feel like they are not too different... but don't quote me on that line. 2 1/1 arcs is a fair amount, it gives you a decent amount of choices... so what could possibly be my problem with the routes??\nWell, before I go into detail with what ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off (sorry about the wording) about the ending, let me quickly say one thing: the Soundtracks are really good in my opinion, however there's only one soundtrack for the Ecchi scenes, which, combined with the abundance of those scenes gets annoying rather quickly.\nSo, about the ending(s)... the way I chose was:   Momoko ending, no Harem. HOWEVER, the developers decided that THAT was the one time that they did not want to do what everyone else did before them and after them. SO, after getting the Momoko ending (which was really well done, good job), they jumped to the next day, where 'Tsundere girl' (I didn't bother remembering her name... I generally hate Tsundere Characters ._-) said that 'Even though I know you two love each other, I will not give up! I will continue to try to seduce you so one day, you'll love me instead. I talked with Momoko about that and we came to the conclusion that that would be alright'... way to ruin an otherwise awesomely done ending.\n\nSo, would I recommend buying it?? hell, just look at what I voted. Unless the other arc(s) are surprisingly long (unlikely), this VN is WAY too short (101 mins and I was done with the Momoko arc...) for it's money, especially since the Steam version of Nekopara does similar things but better for the same cost; the characters are about as unique as the Borderlands 2 Starter Pistol and there were only two times when the VN left it's comfortable spot on the " 'how expectable' chair"... so if you think about buying this game, I think you should rather spend it on 'Sakura Angels' which has VERY similar main girls but has better endings and a story that is somewhat more enjoyable.","August 24, 2015","false","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My english is not the best, but let's give it a try\n\nStory: It's about guy who spend week in Beach hotel with his 2 childhood friends. There is some romance even in end. It was not so mind blowing like in If My Heart Had Wings (Another Visual novel you HAVE TO GET!) but it's not bad. It good, and I even cry in end. Why? It was so touching! I don't want to tell because spoiler, but it's GOOD 8/10\n\nArt: I was a little worried about this, because it was not same style what Sakura Spirit, Sakura Angels and Sakura Fantasy was, but it turn out to be good. It's not same, but it will do. Actually, this was cuter than original. 8/10 AND YES, There is fanservice for those lewd bastads who see just boobies and dat ♥♥♥, but I can ignore those... If I want. It won't distract me from story or girls personalities\n\nGameplay: Same as always. Press Left Mouse to go forward and "next page." In Sakura Beach, there is even more than one ending. You can choose which girl you like so that's a bonus. It gives you chance to get more that just one story, so more reading, pictures and story. 9/10\n\nSoundtracks: This was kind a disappointment. It was just too average. Basic good mood music for normal scenes, sad music for sad scenes, lewd saxophone for dirty scenes and so on. There was only one music track that just "hit me." When you talk serious about love with one of the girls, it made me in tears. That's why i give soundtracks 7/10 and not 6/10\n\nOverall:\nFOR THOSE WHO READ VISUAL NOVELS: This one was good. Not over the top like If My Heart Had Wings, But was not bad, no way. I bought this 7,49€ and it was worth it. Even would give it full price. There is cute girls, good story and... yes, fanservice, but it is decent and does not go "all the way." That's why I salute Winged Cloud. 9/10\n\nFOR THOSE WHO DOES NOT READ VISUAL NOVELS: This is basic Visual novel. It's like a book, but in digital formation. You have text and you read it and then press mouse botton, new text appears. Like turning a page. I say, if you happen to found this in -50% or -75%, give it a try. If you buy this in full price, you might disappoint yourself. But for lower price than 5€? Give it a try, you might start reading Visual Novels, VN. That happened to me when I bought Sakura Spirit for 5€.","August 22, 2015","true","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The two girls make out at some point and invite him for a threesome(pretty much, anyways. It's implied. You have to see it to understand) and he takes it as a "Oh, they must like each other! I'm going to run away because this is really awkward and I'm totally never going to bring up the threesome invitation ever again!"\n\nSo, just finished this fourth installment in the Sakura series and, I'm just going to say this right now, this will be a short and simple review. There will most likely be some spoilters. This is also my first review for a game from this series because honestly writing reviews is mind-bending and annoying. I also write serious reviews because that's totally fun! Oh boy!\n\nIt's a Sakura game. It's Ecchi with a few lesbian-esque scenes to keep you wondering whether not the girls are secretly lesbians and just supportive friends or if they're Bi-sexual and really want to start a harem. Understood? Understood. It's a Sakura game.\n\nThe story is... Alright. The story gets revealed more and more after every "major trip" in the game. E.g. go to the beach, have a monologue about the past and current thoughts. The story, and yes this is a spoiler so skip ahead if you refused to read the second sentence of this review, has a family-troubles / abandonment theme where the character is basically depressed and is explained to have just pushed everyone he knows after he gets a letter from his mother who abandoned him. He was a "troubled" kid so two girls forcefully become his friends and inexplicably fall in love because ♥♥♥♥ you this is an Ecchi romance visual novel. In the end, and I don't know if it ends up like this all the time but this is what I got, they both compete for your love with one of them being your girlfriend.\n\nThe characters were honestly pretty boring. Monoko is your air-headed big-breasted immature sexual character that jokes and flirts around like no tomorrow and Ayumi is your smart, shy, easily angered and proud-as-♥♥♥♥ing-hell character that is the complete opposite of Monoko except for certain scenes that seem out of place e.g. The kissing scene where Ayumi is totally into kissing Momoko and it almost goes further. She even sneaks up on Momoko at some point and puts her hands beneath her bikini bra and "Kneads" her breasts. That's all you need to know. It's the two japanese Tsundere and Yandere archetypes but in a more typical highschool setting and more sexual or in other words more sakura-like.\n\nAlright, now the "news" on the Ecchi stuff. Honestly, it was very tame in this game. It was more the dialogue that was "lewd", as the saying goes. There's like, what, 3 lesbian-esque scenes? Two with one of the girls touches the other girls' boobs/nips and "kneading" them (Yes, it is explained as that. There was some serious foreplay goes on) and one with them making out and basically asking the MC to jump in for a threesome. Let your imagination go wild. Other than that, they're all very tame other than the dialogue which, as I said, was very lewd. There's a scene where it explains how they basically sexually eat popsicles and lick their fingers and lick up ice cream off their own chests. Hell, the kissing scene explains that they get "into it" and start to lower their hands... Basically, with that context, you can make up your own sex scene. Go on, go wild you crazy perverted human being.\n\nMusic was pretty decent, fit the scenarios pretty well, I guess. It was too happy, especially for the gallery-art scenes where it gets indecent.\n\nHonestly, they've improved from, say, Sakura Angels and Spirits. Fantasy was alright but it had the same issue as this game. It was TOO lewd and there's also that whole "nudity-patch" for Fantasy which ruined the point of playing the games, which personally for me was to laugh at the fact that I bought a blue-baller and the fact that it's like a museum piece in a "shames of the games" museum. I'd give it a 6/10 only for the fact that it wasn't horrible but it wasn't great.","September 3, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

It may look different but I assure you the art is still really great. This VN has some hints of Angels and Swim Club to it in terms of story and choices. Even though the MC is kind of an oblivious idiot, like in Spirit, he actually has a legit reason why he might not be focusing too much on why the girls act the ways they do. The story actually is pretty sad and emotional at some parts, kinda like Swim Club, which I really enjoyed. It made me actually feel for the fool. Just like Angels and Swim Club you have two girls basically competing for your attention and your choices do matter more like they do in Angels. All in all this is a fun read with some silly lewd pics to keep you interested if you get a bit bored with the story.\n\nP.S.

It's little more than fap material - which is sad because of the potential plot that can develop around a love triangle like this! That, and I have my own games that let me wonder about the universe - thinking critically should NOT be so complex in a friggin' VN with beaches, babes and boobs.\n\nUnless it goes on sale - or more chapters are released for this story - I wouldn't really recommend it.

Basically, you are a guy who goes on a vacation with your two childhood friends who also happen to be girls. The girls have fallen in love with you, but you are too dense to notice that. The whole vacation are the girls trying to show you that they are in love with you, and that's the whole story of this game about. This game can be considered silly, but in a good way since it features quite a lot of slapstick humor (so far the only Sakura title who features actual comedy) However, there are a lot of ''drama-moments'' and existential crisis moments. It's also implied that at least two of the three characters had a traumatic past/childhood. The game has an ending for each girl. There is no hardcore nudity in Beach, since the artist who made Beach doesn't do hentai, of course there will be the typical ''ecchi'' moments. It's not a bad game, the beginning is quite slow, but towards the end (when more drama-moments appear) the game gets quite serious, and depending on personal experiences quite sad.","January 6","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is a pure snorefest at the start of the game. The story doesnt start to pick up until about half way through. I think my biggest issue was lack of simple drawings that could have been added for more depth to the characters. There isnt a whole lot more they really would have had to add (such as the proper face expression the story calls for), so the fact they refused to even take those extra steps makes it a bit more infuriating. Full disclosure this was my foray into visual novels, so I dont know if this is par for the course. From images seen before online this has contributed to my hesitation of purchasing such "games". I love anime and the art in these games, but I dont understand the phenomena.\n\nOnce the story started to get what I thought was pretty good, it started making the WEIRDEST choices. The absolute worst thing was a scene that was playing out that was very touching when the main character is finishing up his last words, BAM it flips to a super sexual lesbian kiss between the two female character with them asking him to join. I just thought "WTF". Dont get me wrong I appreciate some very sexual lesbian kissing but a. It just wasnt the time or sexual at all and b. Nothing up until that point suggested that the female characters hooked up but instead were very much into the guy but to "Embarresed' to express that love. Yet once it turns in to a hot makeout session all self respect went out the door and he can just go take advantage of these females (even though he didn't). Before that they would knock him out for seeing theier underwear which covered more skin then the bikinis. I mean the list of things that dont make sense from a story telling standpoint to this game would be insane. But like mentioned earlier if you can overlook some of the oddities towards the end, then the story get a bit sweet. The character 'Ayumi" is one of the best drawn females characters I personally think in all of anime subject mannor.\n\nTake with my word with a grain of salt. I am no professional gamer, writer/reviewer, or have any experience, any of that fun stuff.","June 5","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
