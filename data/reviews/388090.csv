Not the jumpscares or cheap noises, but the atmosphere. It has a feeling of reliving your childhood nightmares: monsters coming to get you in your bedroom. Only two nights in, and it terrifies me already. For the other three games, I only really cared about them for the story that was supposedly hidden behind it, waiting to be uncovered. This one, however, I actually feel scared by. Of all of the series, I recommend this one much more than the others.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/manixbak/recommended/388090/","manixbak","Bok M'tek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/manixbak/","418 products in account","Apparently Halloween is on the 23rd of July accroding to Scott Cawthon...\n\n--------------------\n\nEdit:\nOk, since this has somehow become one of the top reviews for this game, I decided to edit it so it's actually helpful. Firstly, the game was teased with images showing the Halloween date. This has led many fans to believe that the release date for this game was going to be on Halloween. However, Scott later announced that Five Nights at Freddy's 4 was going to be released sometime in August and that a DLC would be released on Halloween. But, even Scott himself said that he is bad with release dates and he released it early, on the 23rd of July. Ok, Now I'm actually going to review the game:\n\nSummary (TL;DR): It's completely different to the previous FNAF games but it's more scary and it looks better.\n\nActual Review:\nThis is the 4th and probably the final game in the Five Night's at Freddy's series, with an expansion pack coming out on Halloween and a movie being worked on which is planned to be released sometime in 2017.\nThe game itself differs quite significantly from the previous 3 games because instead of playing as an adult security guard during a night shift, you play as a young child at home. This means that there are no cameras, no high-tech lockable doors and no power management. Before each night, the player is presented in an 8-bit styled minigame which explains the backstory and shows how the child is locked in his room and later starts walking around the house.\nThen the night starts, the gameplay mainly consists of running around the room, using a flashlight, and holding the doors closed as you can't actually lock them. You can run to the left door which is where Bonnie is, the right door where Chica is, the central closet where Foxy is, and you can look behind you where miniature Freddies or Fredbears can be. When you approach the door, you must actually listen  for someone breathing which forces you to turn the volume up which later makes the unexpected jumpscares louder and scarier. If there is no breathing, you can flash the flashlight to check if anyone is there. If there is breathing, then you must hold the door shut and wait to avoid being killed. You must also look behind you to make sure that too many mini-Freddies don't gang up on you. Then there's Foxy in the closet and I have no idea how he works.\nSo that is the basic gameplay for the actual nights, however, there is one more thing which starts happening in between nights after night 1, the Plushtrap minigame. In the minigame, Plushtrap (a miniature version of Springtrap from FNAF 3) sits on a tall chair in front of you. He will not move if you shine your flashlight at him and he might move if you don't. There is an "x" marked on the floor in front of Plushtrap and the objective is to get Plushtrap to stand on that "x". To do this, you must not shine your flashlight for a few seconds to get him to move. If you manage to make him stand on the "x" within the time limit, then the next night will be 2 hours shorter.\n\nTo conclude, this seems to be the best and the scariest Five Nights at Freddy's game out of all of them. The animations are much more detailed and smooth and the gameplay is much more interesting than the previous games.","July 23, 2015","true","0.4"," 2,109 of 2,640 people (80%) found this review helpful 2,410 people found this review funny","80","109","2","410","77"

Not because it was impossible, but because I've been incredibly busy. I honestly have to say that I really like this game. The obvious camera-checking mechanic is gone, and in turn has yet again changed the game entirely. That's the thing about the FNAF games. No one game is the same. They aren't cheap remakes, they're each innovative and change how the game is played in their own way. The FNAF series in my opinion really picked up around the third installment. In that game, there was less randomly-generated stuff and more skill-required gameplay. THAT is what the game needed. In the first two games, there was frankly too much random-generated BS that would kill you when it's not even your fault. In FNAF4, you have to rely entirely on learning sound cues and knowing where to go at the right time. You have to adapt to a new kind of game. You aren't overwhelmed with keeping up with things, you just have to listen and act adequately. This is a hard game. I mean that when I say it, I died many times on the first night. Granted that's because I still had to learn how it works, but it's no joke. All the way up until the game mixes things up on Night 5. You defend yourself against one animatronic, as opposed to four (hearkening back to FNAF3). You get so used to hearing certain audio cues, then realizing that "Hey, that's not normal,". You check outside your door and see something you've never seen before, and immediately die. Night 5 changes, even while you play. You're constantly learning new things and adapting to them. Not to even get started on Night 6 (which I beat) and Nightmare (which I did not). Scott receives a lot of hate for putting out the games too fast, but that's just how he is. He works exceptionally hard, and he outdoes himself. He makes good games. Overall, it's a good game. The story to be uncovered is intriguing, and the gameplay has nearly been perfected. It's a horror game, but one you can have fun and enjoy yourself with. I recommend giving it a try.","August 10, 2015","true","5.3"," 150 of 205 people (73%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","73","150","205","20","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/simplyexpand/recommended/388090/","simplyexpand","Expand","http://steamcommunity.com/id/simplyexpand/","117 products in account","As the supposed final chapter to the Five Nights at Freddy's Series, comes a much scarier (my personal opinion) experience than the original games. That being said, this game does suffer a lot of flaws regardless of the scary atmosphere and animatronics. One major feature of the series has disappeared; the cameras. Even though this can be seen as a bad decision; the game behaves much differently than the past chapters in the series, and it makes sense why the cameras are gone once you boot up the game for the first time. Feature-wise, I think this game takes the cake for having the best features in the entire game series; and its so different that at first it really doesn't feel like a Five Nights at Freddy's game until you get jumpscared. Although the formula is getting worn out; I do believe that this has the best animations and jumpscares in the series.\n\nStory:\n\nThe Five Nights at Freddy's games always had great stories, and I can say the same about this game. Although the ending to the third game was perfect, and the fourth games ending is just a little below the third game's ending, it still has a deep ending. Without going too much into spoilers, this story will confuse you, and make you stop and think about how this connects to the others more than FNAF 3 did.\n\nVerdict:\n\nThis spectacular ending to the game's series is almost as good as it should be, throwing jumpscares at you everytime you fail, and has new features makes it mostly different than the other ones and has a satisfying story; making this game one of the best in the series. Although there are many flaws; the game makes up for it with its deep story, and if do not like deep stories; than this game is pretty much not for you. Maybe even the series isn't for you. But that being said, this game is a pretty good horror game; and even though its not like other top AAA games with being able to move around; the sense of not being able to move creates more fear and suspense. But, after a while the jumpscares start to get old, removing some of the fear you got the first time you were jumpscared.\n\nRating:\n\n8/10\n\n+ Great Story\n+ Scarier than most of the other games in the series\n+ Awesome Jumpscares\n+ Newer Features\n\n- Game's fear factor gets old a little after getting all jumpscares.\n- Formula is still a little worn out.\n- Didn't live all the way up to the FNAF 3 ending.\n\nIf you do not like Five Nights at Freddy's, do not buy this game (obviously).\n\nAlthough the game has DLC coming out soon, which may not even be DLC, it can still totally make up for the ending. But I reviewed this game's core, and since the DLC may not be content added to the game, the game still has a weaker story than FNAF 3.\n\nEDIT: In my personal opinion the story is deep and brilliant, but regardless its still great story :)","July 27, 2015","true","2.1"," 208 of 307 people (68%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","68","208","307","18","10"

[Achtung, spoilers!]\n\nIt isn't a secret, that FNAF is just set of screamers, rather than nice game in genre "horror" such as "Outlast", "Amnesia", "Hektor", etc. But still, it's damn scary game and its plot is fricking exciting.\n\nI haven't played much FNAF, FNAF 2 or FNAF 3, but I know the story, that Scott Cawthon was telling us in his games. And that's... violent, exciting, shrill story.\n\n"You know, friend, there has happened an accident in 1987 with one child, that was visiting pizzeria called "Freddy Fazbear's Pizza". I didn't know how it happen, but they told me... There was a boy. He was really scared of that big mascots, that were in pizzeria to entertain children and other visitors. He had an elder brother, that always was such a jerk. He scared that boy with a mask of Foxy, when they were all alone at home. But, can you imagine, what he did on his birthday? He told his friends to put on masks of all mascots and when they scared that little boy out. They thought it was fun. And when that boy's brother decided to make more fun with that situation.\nOh, I don't know, how they could do it, but still... They put that boy right in mouth of Fredbear mascot. The boy cried a lot, and then Fredbear's chops just CRACK! so mascot took a bite of the child's head. After that accident that boy was in a coma. I don't know, what happen after all this situation, my friend, but I hope he's alright".\n\nIn fact, this game has made very strong impression for me. In addition to the hidden story, this chapter is different from the others by the presence of good animation, by the completely new atmosphere, really terrible mascots and one feature: from now on, we look not only at what is in front of us, but also at what is behind us.\n\nSome people may say, that Scott Cawthon made bad games and receives millions for this, but I can strongly disagree with that.\nI'd like to say thank you, Scott, for this games and hidden story in them, that you were telling us all this time. I'll remember that for a really long time and hope, that you'll make new games such as this and tell us another exciting story.","August 3, 2015","true","4.4"," 147 of 220 people (67%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","67","147","220","21","7"

Almost everything people had problems with previously have been addressed to create an ideal, more traditional horror game that still feels unique and stays true to the concept of Five Nights at Freddy's.\n\nContrary to popular belief, this is not just a jumpscare simulator. The game creates a perfect atmosphere with the use of ambient noises (Dogs barking off in the distance, crickets chirping, chimes of a grandfather clock, the footsteps of the monsters lurking through your home, etc.) and settings. That, combined with the tension, anticipation, and fear of the unknown that the mechanics create (similar to the first game), you'll find yourself terrified long before you experience a jumpscare.\n\nThat's not to say the jumpscares are ineffective. In fact, they will give you heart attacks. A clever new mechanic requires you to listen carefully for breathing outside your door before you choose to shine the flashlight or hold the door shut. If you hear the breathing of a monster, you have to close the door until you hear the footsteps of it walking away. If you choose instead to shine the light in its face (which normally makes them go away if they're at the far end of the hall), you get jumped. This makes you turn your volume up to listen for the audio cues, resulting in heart-pounding scares.\n\nThis time around, the jumpscares can happen in multiple situations, and aren't only reserved for when you fail the night. There isn't a single jumpscare that's predictable (the only exception might be before you flash the light down the hall). It doesn't play by the same rules as the others where you're always safe from a scare until you prompt an opportunity for it to happen, they just happen whenever. Think you're safe until you check the doors? Nope, Foxy will scream at you out of nowhere when you go to check the closet. Or Bonnie will lunge at you when you turn around from checking the bed, in your own room. There's also a cryptic backstory told through 8-bit minigames between nights, which also has its fair share of scares (albeit not nearly as scary as the main nights, as they're not supposed to be).\n\nIf you're a fan of horror games, you should play Five Nights at Freddy's 4. Scott Cawthon has really outdone himself with this game, he's listened to previous criticism and improved the horror aspect of the game significantly. It's a great way to end the series, and we can expect a free content update on Halloween that will make your eight dollars more than worth it if you didn't feel so already.","July 26, 2015","true","2.8"," 100 of 155 people (65%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","65","100","155","8","2"

I've noticed others are having the same problem of at the beginning of the night, when you first go to each door, (left door, closet, right door, bed) it will freeze for a few seconds, but the animatronics remain active, causing greater chancces of you being caught.

No cameras, no phone guy, and from what I can tell, no batteries or system errors in the game. However, that being said, the game has some loading problems for me; I run over to one of the doors, and it takes a few seconds for the doorway to load, and it takes even longer for me to be able to use my flashlight. As we all know, in FNAF games, timing and precision is key, so this isn't helping me survive. Also, there are the fullscreen problems, which ruin the immersion a bit. ALSO, as 1,987 people have already said, the 'breathing' is much too quiet, and I can barely hear it at full volume. To be fair, I don't have working headphones, so the audio might be a bit better if I had them. I personally can't get past night 2, and have been killed by Bonnie, Chica, and the cupcake numerous times. (I like to call the cupcake 'Chucky.') We'll see if that works out. Overall, it's looking pretty good, but we could have waited until August 8th so Scott could clean up the bugs.\nEDIT: So after the update, Scott fixed the fullscreen problems, and he made the breathing louder. Now the only problem is the lag it gives me when first running to a door, but that might just be because my computer isn't exactly meant for gaming. I'm still horrible at the game, and I still can't get past night 2, but now I can't blame the game or Scott for my awfulness.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GrantSteam/recommended/388090/","GrantSteam","Grantango/Грантанго","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GrantSteam/","30 products in account","Am I gonna say what I think of the game? Yes, I liked it. Though, it was the story that was the best part. Gameplay is hard to grasp as the "breathing" is hard to identify.\n\n7/10\n\nNow to tell people why this game doesn't take place in 1987. "Of course, your gonna use the commercial argument!" Actually, no. Even before I discovered that commercial, I knew that there were story elements from other games that prevent this game from taking place in 1987. Here are the facts. (spoilers for all games ahead)\n\nFirst, it's to note that it never says in-game when the game takes place. People assume 1987 because an animatronic bites a child. As such, don't assume 1987 automatically. Secondly, we need to know the timeline of the restaurants. FNAF4 comes first during Fredbear's Family Diner, second is the first Freddy Fazbear's Pizzaria (which no game has taken place), third is the 2nd Pizzaria in FNAF2, fourth is the 3rd Pizzaria in FNAF1, and lastly Fazbear's Fright in FNAF3. The only game with a confirmed date is FNAF2, which is in 1987. So, if FNAF4 is also in 1987, then there would be three different restaurants existing in one year, which is ridiculous. And remember, the 2nd Pizzaria was only open for 2 weeks. But, we are here for hard evidence, not an argument against something ridiculous.\n\n1. Passage of Time\nOn Night 5 of FNAF2, Phone Guy says\n\n"Uh, I think the name of the original restaurant was... 'Fredbear's Family Diner' or something like that. It's been closed for years though, I doubt we'll be able to track anyone down."\n\nSo, Fredbear's Family Diner had been closed for YEARS before FNAF2, making it impossible for it to be in 1987.\n\n2. Moving Animatronics\n\nThe first message we ever get says\n\n"Uh, they used to be allowed to walk around during the day too. But then there was The Bite of '87. Yeah. I-It's amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know?"\n\nSo, after the Bite, the animatronics weren't allowed to move around. So, if the Bite of 87 was at Fredbear's Diner, then the animatronics shouldn't be able to move around afterwards, right? Well, not according to Phone Guy on Night 1 of FNAF2.\n\n"They've spent a small fortune on these new animatronics, uh, facial recognition, advanced mobility, they even let them walk around during the day. Isn't that neat?"\n\nEven so, in the Foxy minigame (which takes place at the 1st Pizzaria, since Pirate's Cove doesn't look like the one in FNAF1) it shows Foxy being able to move around during shows as he is running on stage. And when you think about it, it's ridiculous to blame the Bite on Fredbear in FNAF4 when it wasn't even his fault. The 4th game shows a bunch of teens putting a little kid inside Fredbear's mouth, making it their fault, not Fredbear's. Plus, Fredbear wasn't even moving around.\n\n3. Position of the Child\n\nLook at the bite in FNAF4. It doesn't look like his frontal lobe is being bitten off. The child's position makes it seem that his head is being crushed, not just his frontal lobe.\n\n4. What Happens To Dreams\n\nThe Game Theorist made a point proving that, scientifically, if someone loses their frontal lobe, they wouldn't even have nightmares. They would instead have happy dreams.\n\nThere you go. I didn't even have to use the commercial to prove it. The only reason people look to the 1983 in the commercial for the date is because it's the only date ever shown that makes sense, not because it's randomly there. So, hopefully this taught you information you didn't know.\n\nI will also answer any questions you guys have.\n\nEdit:\nSo, there is confusion on whether or not FNAF4 takes place at Fredbear's or Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.\n\nThe FNAF3 minigame (which is confirmed to be the first, thanks to Phone Guy) is NOT the one we see in FNAF4. While similar in design, look at the hat of the bear. The minigame's hat is brown and Fredbear's hat is purple.\n\nSecondly, the main antagonist of FNAF4 is Fredbear, which puts him as the most important.\n\nLastly, poromotion everywhere for the restaurant refers to Fredbear, NOT Freddy. Why else would the commercial say "FREDBEAR and Friends"?","August 9, 2015","true","0.6"," 46 of 69 people (67%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","67","46","69","12","2"

For three games, I had nothing but cameras to keep myself safe and learnt when to look and when to focus on what was near my office. Now, all I have is my skill and my headphones to guide me to 6AM. I love that. During the last three games, there was a point where you would eventually get jumpscared so many times that they would become numb and somewhat frustrating.

MUST BE A TROLL RIGHT?"\n\n\nNo.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Five Nights at Freddy's 4 is quite the interesting game, it serves a pretty haunting and deep storyline, along with an interesting concept of a game. However, this game certainly is not THAT good, I don't think it's very deserving of the "Overwhelmingly Positive" reviews out there.\n\nSo, you play as the victim from the infamous bite of 87, which is quite a nice twist in the storyline. Haunted over the event, the child begins to fear these animatronics, and pictures them as these freakish monster creatures. I wont dive to in depth with the story, this is for you to figure out yourself.\n\nI think Five Nights at Freddy's 4 is a great achievement as well, considering it was made in Clickteam Fusion, however the engine the game uses is actually a major flaw... You see, I personally think gameplay over graphics, however, considering this game's visuals aren't all too stunning, the animation quality can sometimes seem un-natural, and the game's only control is to click on doors and hold down a few keys every now shows that this game lacks both gameplay and graphics. People are going to begin to say "DO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT IT MEANS FOR A GAME TO BE POINT AND CLICK!?" which I do know, I just don't think it really works out. You see, when you're trying to make a horror game that's meant to be immersive and meant to be creepy, you'd think you would get a little more out of it.\n\nAnother thing I didn't really like is that the game... isn't scary... Yeah, you probably think I'm just trying to make myself look brave and all, but I'm not. Even when PewDiePie played the game, he never flinched. That guy overreacts to everything, and the fact that he doesn't to this game probably says something. Sure, you may find it scary, but personally, I don't, and I know a hand full of people who agree with me.\n\nPros:\n- Interesting concept\n- Intriguing story-line\n- A nice twist to the series\n\nCons:\n- Lacks gameplay\n- Lacks immersive visuals\n- Relies too heavily on jump-scares to be scary\n- Animation quality is pretty bad\n- Serves very little hours of gameplay (if this is what you call gameplay)\n\n\nIf you are expecting a rating out of me, I would personally say it's a 5/10, I understand other people may actually enjoy this game, and that's great for you if you do, however I didn't find much out of it. Also, a 5 isn't THAT bad. It's a mediocre game, that's all.\n\n\nAlso, just throwing this out, this doesn't change my perspective on the game, but I think it's something that should be made clear. This game's fanbase if awful, possibly one of the worse fandoms out there. It's filled with false hype, over-saturation, and childish behavior. In fact, I bet I will get a comment telling me how wrong I am, by someone who can't prove even prove me wrong.\n\n\nLastly, this isn't self advertisement, in fact I find this to be shameful on myself. I noticed this review is getting more and more traffic very fast and therefor it's bound for someone to recognize me. Yes, I am that guy who made the "How to animate FNAF in SFM tutorial" along with a handful of other FNAF videos. I regret it at moments, and don't animate anything Five Nights at Freddy's unless it's like super requested that I do one video in particular. A FNAF video that started off as a joke quickly escalated into more request overtime. I don't mind making them, just as long as I can take a short break and make a "whatever video" or something, which I do. Call me a hypocrite, however, I never once said I liked FNAF in the past."","August 7, 2015","false","2.0"," 546 of 980 people (56%) found this review helpful 72 people found this review funny","56","546","980","72","141"

You're a kid, having to defend yourself against the Nightmare Animatronics, in order to do so, you need to move next to the doors, and listen carefully if there are breathing sounds, if there are breathing sounds, you need to shut down the door, and wait 'till you hear footsteps. But you never know if you're safe. If you succesfully defended yourself, or not. The next time you flash the light, might be the time of your death. And during the time you have to shut down the door. If you succesfully defend yourself, you still cannot think calmly. You're still worried an animatronic can come from the door, or the bed, or even the closet. You have to constatly defend yourself, while being scared of the animatronics.\nThe game is also very good at causing surprise attacks. Things like Foxy's "Failed Jumpscare" is something which makes the game feel a lot more lively, and great. There are also a few nights where you suddenly have to change your strategy, due to something new coming up, making you have a lot of more fright due to the fact of not knowing what to do, due to the extremely creepy looks of the animatronics.\nThe game also has some small things which made the first game very good, like random, creepy sounds, like Freddy's laugh, dogs barking, and such.\nThe game also reveals another part of the FNaF story, which is quite sad.\n\nFive Nights at Freddy's 4 is an amazing horror game, which brings together the scariest parts of all the games, turning it into a game with brand new gameplay, creepy animatronics, and everything you need in a good horror game.\nI recommend Five Nights at Freddy's 4 greatly, if you did not like the previous games, I would recommend you to pick this one up, as this one will very likely scare the heck outta you.","July 24, 2015","true","12.5"," 36 of 57 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","36","57","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Torashu/recommended/388090/","Torashu","Torashu™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Torashu/","351 products in account","Ugh. Where do I begin... Sit down and I'll start from the beginning.\n\nFive nights at freddy's, since Game 2, has been growing stale. The game is getting boring to the point that I'm qualifying it as a Red light-green light simulator, the lore is getting lame (And no, Game theory does NOT count as your lore source), and it's the same shmuck each, and every time.\n\nAs a casual fan of the first, this installment, almost does nothing better to the series as a whole. If there is one thing I can say he nailed, was the child-nightmare atmoshephere. The rest? Well, let me spell it out for you.\n\nSOUND The sound is varied at many times. Your goal is to listen for breathing noises behind 3 doors. If you hear it, you close the door. Simple mechanic. Now here lies the problem...The breathing? Doesn't exist. It just doesn't. I have fine hearing, I have a optimized computer, and I have headphones for maximum sounds. Still nothing. This is the thing that pains me most. Your main mechanic doesn't work.\n\nGRAPHICS The overall atmosphere of the game is, to me, spot on. It's definitely better than the last two games in the series. The second was too similar to the first, and the third was just ugly to look at. Here? It's got the best of both. You're a child, locked in his room, in the middle of the night, when those that go bump in said night, are awake, and ready to take you into a brand new no-banana underworld. There is, one problem with it: Just like the other games, it gets repetitive, real fast. You're stuck in a single room, the entire time. No walking around, no trying to run, no, you sit there, and you keep your mouth shut. There''s nothing else, but jumpscares, and if you know Ol' me, than you would know that "Jumpscares, are Diet Scares". Subtlety is best if you wanna get a genuine scare. Wanna know a good game with the perfect fear factor? Majora's Mask. I hear you Little Ankle biters sayin' "That game's OLD! Get with the times!" Well, no. Before you start slammin' my new wood finish floor with y' grubby paws and cry, lemme tell you something.\n\nThe moon? It has a face, eyes as red as crimson, and it always follows you, no matter where you go. You can't escape it, and it gets closer each day. It doesn't scream, it doesnt talk, it doesn't try t' kill you....yet. It floats up there, staring. Judging. Watching. Never blinking. AND it will always be there. To me? something like that nails the fear factor. Jumpscares are loud noises. You're getting STARTLED. You big baby.\n\nSTORY What's there to say? Some ghostie story the kid you play hear probably messed 'im up, cause the boy's too soft. If he were my kid, I'd send him on an adventure to toughen him up. He can bounce on some bozo's face and have a merry old time, but no. The parents were probably too stupid to realize they shouldn't be talking to a 3 year old kid like they were his age, and now he sees thing. The "Lore", as you whipper snappers call it, doesnt do diddly. You don't get told this "Lore" in game? Then go shove a banana down y' gullet. There is none. That Game theory Guy doesn't make the story, or lack there of.\n\nOVERALL The game has too many problems. The game is repetitive, the Jumpscares are, GASP, not scary, and it feels like something my Old Game and Watch would play forever.\n\nNow buzz off! I'm gettin' me some sleep. Oh, and shut the door on the way out! Gets drafty in here.","July 26, 2015","false","1.2"," 1,016 of 1,861 people (55%) found this review helpful 259 people found this review funny","55","016","1","259","145"

It's a simple, yet extremely complex game that makes you use you senses to get through it. In that sense, it's original, but the the rest of the gameplay is rather the same, but diffrent.\nLemme elaborate on that. The lack of camras, locks, any mask, or anything like that gives the game a challange right away. It alienates those who have gotten used to FNaF being like that. That's not a bad thing, but it isn't the gratest thing in the world.\nThe first of the few new mechanics is the door set. The three doors that your worried about are the two bedroom doors and the closet door. You must check all three of them. Often. The bedroom doors have their own mechanic i'll go over later, but the closet door: you run up to it, flash you light, and if somebody's there, spam every key and pray to god that you don't die. Easy peasy.\nThe next new mechanic is the two bedroom doors. These have the mechanic of quiet sounds. This means you have to use earphones with the volume all the way up to hear the (lack of) noises. If you hear breathing, close the door, if not, then shine your light.\nThe third mechanic is the bed. The bed is behind you, meaning you have to turn around every now and again to check for freddles. I'll leave you to google freddles.\nGiven that this is a long reveiw, i'll end it here, but that's the basics of the game.\nPeace\n\n","April 9","true","0.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

It abandoned the camera system which is good since you've  always ignored most of the cams in the late game anyway. I'm very satisfied with the way it is now. This time it really has you in constant fear. You can't immediately check for lurking threats. You have to wait and listen for ominous thunder-like breaths or else you fall victim to your own impatience. My favorite new thing is that it has some sort of final boss, an extra menacing monstrosity, which will undoubtedly haunt your dreams. It's not too hard either  unlike the 3rd game  and is quite managable. Although it has weird performance issues when loading the screens at the start of any night, it doesn't affect the gameplay enough to make you upset.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rkayde/recommended/388090/","rkayde","The Get F*cked Machine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rkayde/","211 products in account","Up until recently, I've been happy with the FNAF storyline. The lore was deep, the clues were clever, and all in all it was an enjoyable romp... but, I can't help but feel like this game ends in the worst way possible. I don't find a lot of pleasure in progressing through a mystery, wracking my brain to put the loose pieces together, staying up for hours trying not to die of a heartattack in my chair, only to be met with a brick wall at the end of things. It's like telling a disjointed story for 4 chapters and the final pages are all blank. Sort of like "The hero stood before the keep with his sword drawn. As the dragon rose up from behind the spires he could hear the princess calling his name from the highest tower. Steadfast and diligent, the hero began to cross the drawbridge, inching closer and closer to the dr-" and then nothing.\n\nThe story stops mid-scene. There's no rising action or climax, just a bunch of unanswered questions.\n\nI can totally get behind creativity, and every one has a different method of story telling, but what makes a story is a beginning, middle and end. No offense, but I don't find omission of an ending to be a creative means.\n\nI understand that Scott is hesitant to release the ending because of his anxiety revolving around the fan base response, but completely cutting out the ending isn't the way to go about this. Any writer worth his salt should present their stories as they intended, and I don't think that this was meant to be swept under the rug and over-shadowed with a plush-doll RPG. I'm hoping that the details with either be revealed in movie form, or through the game in an update later, but I'm not going to hold my breath.\n\nTo be honest, this is why I stopped watching M. Night Shamalananananan movies... when you go through all of this without a proper pay off, you're left feeling like you've wasted your time, energy and money. If this is the kind of storytelling we can expect in the future, I'm afraid I'll have to decline further indulgence in the series.\n\nI mean, I'm the type of person who hates the idea of unfinished games hitting the market, and I steer clear of a lot of indy titles for that reason. With FNAF, I thought was being immersed in a grand mystery that would inevitably end with the facts being laid out. While it's fun to speculate, there's no real substitution for directors intent. I wanted to see how this story was supposed to end, not leave it up to kids on YouTube to theorize and rant about for views. Overall, with this being the final chapter and no conflict resolution, I'm concerned that further games and tales will end this way.\n\nAt the end of the day, I play other people's games for entertainment and storytelling. As it stands, this story is unfinished, disjointed and any conclusions are just speculation from reddit and youtube.\n\nIf you had asked me if I would recommend any game from the series before this point, I would have been able to put forth a great review and sing high praises, but now, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone simply for the fact that all they're going to get for their troubles are panic attacks and a deep sense of disappointment.\n\nThe way this series has allegedly ended has made me reconsider seeing the movie or purchasing any further work from this developer or any other indy developer. I would love to get the time and the $30.00+ I've spent on these games back, but that's how we learn. We gamble and we lose. Next time, I'll exercise more caution when delving into the indy community, if I even decided to gamble again. I also cannot recommend to friends, family or anyone else that they play these games, see the movie or go for the new RPG.\n\nI wouldn't recommend dry-humping over actual sex, so I can't recommend a game that gives you mental blue balls.","September 17, 2015","false","1.1"," 35 of 61 people (57%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","57","35","61","6","0"

But after a quick update by the AMAZING Scott Cawthon, it ALL makes sense now!!!\n\nFirst, he turned up the volume so you could hear the effects so you know if you should shut the door or not. Second, DON'T decide quickly, this is a MUCH slower paced game then the other FNAF's. You should wait about 5 seconds at each door BEFORE deciding whether or not to shut it. DO NOT RUSH, THAT is the problem most people, including myself, have had about this game.\n\nNow that I FINALLY understand it, I LOVE THIS GAME TO DEATH!!! And I hate it, but I LOVE hating it cause it's SOOO fun and SOOO scary! 10/10 Best FNAF ever, and SCARIEST FnaF ever.\n\nScott, we were all confused, so ignore the negative reviews. We didn't understand how to play and what to do. But now that you explained it, IT IS PHENOMENAL!! You have really out-done yourself this time, my friend. It's obvious to see you really care about this game, and it's community, and it shows, and we all love you for it.

Granted I might be biased because I live in a small enough room that my bed is only about a foot and a half away from my computer chair, so when checking for the little creepy teddy freddies, I make it a point to also check to make sure my cat isn't going to give me a heart attack!\n\nDown to brass tax, I didn't care for the "Sit-and-don't-waste-power" gameplay of the first two, but the gameplay of FNAF 3 was a step in the right direction; for me at least. FNAF 4 puts you face-to-face with the animatronics in a way that encourages careful attention over quick reflex, a mode of thinking where we find ourselves more vulnderable to whatever nightmares hide in the shadows.\n\nThe story can also be enjoyed without knowledge of the previous three games, as it's more of a side-story where you play a young boy in his room rather than a minimum-wage security guard sitting in an office. The story is also easier to follow than previous entries. Now the Atari 2600 style minigames act as a platform for storytelling instead of audio logs, and a spring-trap red light/green light minigame can allow players to skim two hours off their nights.\n\nIf you're looking for a more active FNAF experience, with an eaiser to follow somber story that can give you moist eyes and a pounding heart, then FNAF 4 is certainly worth your time and coin.","May 27","true","0.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Five Nights at Freddys 4 takes place inside a house then in a establishment. This is my favorite game out of the four because it builds up more suspense for the player. Also this game has no cameras or monitors, instead you only have a flashlight to keep you protected. It also has lots of modes that allow you to change the settings of the night, for example you can make the characters harder by setting their difficulty by 1-20, or you can see when they are coming. In my opinion, this is a very nice game.

System reboots are stupid.\nFNAF 4: Relies on hearing to get cheap scares since you listen so hard. Animatronics are trying too hard to be scary.

If you like the other games give this one a thumbs up, if you're indifferent to the series, give it a thumbs down.\n\nFNAF4 is the first game to not take place in some kind of security control room though it does function entirely the same in terms of gameplay. You're checking a left and right doorway which now replace the left and right hallway doors from the other games and your flashlight is the primary mode of defense.\n\nFNAF 4 relies a lot more heavily on audio cues, listening to footsteps, laugher, etc though this is ruined by those obnoxious jump scares that will pop your eardrums with repeated play. Again however the art style looks great, it does sound incredible even though it still runs in a horrid resolution.\n\nOverall, the series has had its run through Youtubers and a younger demographic which is fine, but maybe it's time for Freddy to retire.\n\nFull video review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmlerdZ0hL0","August 15, 2015","false","1.7"," 49 of 93 people (53%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","53","49","93","8","5"

Nobody's been forced to buy the game. Nobody's been forced to sit through playthroughs. It's a popular game and it's easy to see why, through its simplicity and yet, elegance it strikes a mighty spear of fear into the heart. Of course the fanbase can be a bit (very) loopy at times, but that should not be taken into account when judging a game on its ability to scare.\n\nAnd this game does it in spades. The atmosphere is very refreshing, with the lack of camera system being a warm welcome. The apprehension of flicking your flashlight on to check hallways because you're not sure if you did or did not hear an animatronic. Hell, you can't even relax in a damn minigame because even Plushtrap wants to mess you up.

Oh, and I'll mostly be reiterating the NEGATIVE reviews, which is never a good thing.  The first thing which I feel I can safely say, in any case...is that this is hands-down MY LEAST FAVOURITE FREDDY GAME thus far.  By a LONG margin.\n\nThe general atmosphere of the game gets at least part-way there, but the gameplay suffers immensely from the simple fact of its CHIEF MECHANIC being questionably executed.  For ♥♥♥♥'s sake, I just got my ears syringed out a few weeks ago, and I'll be buggered if I can hear any of the so-called "audio cues" which my character lives-or-dies by (I certainly haven't heard any "breathing" as of yet, just faint shuffling and the like).\n\nLet me put it another way:  I'm no good at the three earlier games, and certainly haven't managed to get all the way to the end of them - Night 4 is the most I've managed on any - but at least I by-and-largely "got" what it was that those games wanted me to do.  Sure, Mr Cawthon always throws in a few curve-balls as the nights progress, but I seriously didn't even feel like I won the first night of this instalment fair-and-square:  I got through it on the second go, after "getting jump-scared" at 4am on the first...but didn't feel that I "deserved" to survive to 6am the second time around any more than I felt that I "deserved" to get subsequently jump-scared at 3am the NEXT night!\n\nI'm keenly listening out for the breathing or whatever, but seriously...how good do my HEADPHONES have to be?!  Even when I believe I've heard something, I for the life of me cannot tell WHICH of the three doors I'm supposed to be checking.  Sometimes I seem to fluke it, sure, but I certainly don't feel in "control" of my own fate.  It's naught but SHEER DUMB LUCK which seems to have decided how far I've progressed to date (though I do have a fair grip on how to look behind me regularly, to ensure that Foxy doesn't "take me" from behind, so the mechanics which resemble those from the earlier games still work well enough).\n\nThe game's problems don't end there, however.  For all its atmosphere, FNAF4 ultimately lacks SUSPENSE.  Suspense is precisely what makes so-called "jump-scares" scary - without a build-up, it's just an image and a sound effect - and the frenzied running back and forth of your character almost makes this feel more like a sports simulation with the occasional "BOO!" thrown in for good measure.  Also, as much as I love the idea of a game based around childhood fears - "Among the Sleep" being a shining example herein - the sudden shift from the Freddy Fazbear's Pizza franchises to a little boy's bedroom is...well, a tad abrupt, and a tiny bit perplexing.\n\nMaybe it's just time for an ALL-NEW SERIES, Scott?  'Cause there's not much about this entry which doesn't stink of desperation and a growing lack of ideas.  I mean, let's be honest here.  You made one truly GREAT game, and two really bloody GOOD ones...so who are you exactly, Kim Jong-il?  Won't stop 'til you achieve complete world domination?!  Time for a fresh start and a rethink, methinks.\n\nIn short, despite the fact that I'm not very "good" at any of them, I still found the first three FNAF games to be surprisingly compelling; meaning that even when I was losing, they kept me coming back, and I either got up to - or agonisingly close to - Night 4 on all of them (hell, the first one, I think I've even managed the cusp of Night 5).  This one, I just plain-gave-up on Night 2.\n\nNothing about this game strikes me as "fair" to the player.  There's an incredibly similar game called Boogeyman - which came out some months AFTER this one, so I'm going to assume it took substantial cues from this, though it may in all fairness have been in development prior - but it deserves kudos, in any case, for executing much the same premise (sound cues and all) in a decidedly more successful manner.  Boogeyman, like earlier FNAF games, by-and-largely strikes me as hard-but-fair...whereas this is simply HARD, if not nigh-on IMPOSSIBLE.  Either that, or my recent ear-syringing damaged the very specific range of the aural spectrum which the sound effects of this game just happen to occupy, so I'll never get to "enjoy" this painfully pedantic and repetitive game the way that countless thousands of others (claim to) have.\n\nThis really, really pains me, 'cause I do believe that Scott Cawthon is a very talented dude and I look forward to any games he makes in the future.  BUT...after giving highly praising reviews to the first three games in this series...I'm sadly going to have to give this one a THUMBS-DOWN.  ♥♥♥♥♥ me to tears, it honestly does.  But for me, at least, this game is not even PLAYABLE.  And yes, I am writing this well after all the supposed "fixes" which Mr Cawthon made, so I can't even begin to imagine how "subtle" the sound effects were in the original release.

Playing as a child who was never taught monsters can't get you under the quilts instead takes it upon himself to defend his honor to be able stay up after bedtime by tackling the one true nightmarish horror, tetanus shots.\n\nUltimately the game runs more in line with FNAF 2, creating a pattern and never doing anything but that pattern for the entire game. It also feels much shorter by comparison to the previous games too, which likely isn't helped by the true ending hinting at things to come.\n\nIf you're a fan of the series, have bought every previous title and ERP in the Steam Community Discussions as your favorite Robot-Waifu, well. You've probably already bought it. Otherwise if you're tentative about embarking on this month's robot murder fest, I'd recommend watching few gameplay videos, but I must warn you in advance.

The game really catches you off guard with the scares, and I love it.  The atmosphere and ambience does a great job of setting the mood, and the animation is a lot more fluent than in the previous games.  Definitely a massive improvement in all aspects with the 4th of the series.  The "physically checking the locations" gameplay style is a lot more entertaining and scary than the camera system from the previous games.  It's pretty startling to have to worry about the animatronics coming to you, but it's even more frightening to think that you might inadvertently run into them.  The addition of the mini game that allows you to skip the first two hours of the next night if you can beat it is awesome.  Who knew that "Red Light, Green Light" could ever be so tense?  Well done on this game!  I just hope I can steel my nerves well enough to beat it!","July 23, 2015","true","0.6"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","9","16","4","0"

At the moment I'm literally finding it impossible to hear ANY sound cues that point to the fact that I'm about to die (headphones in, volume near max and yes I pause to listen). Everything is way too quiet UNTIL an animatronic scares me, and then at that point my ear drums are blown out! I'm not scared of anything in the game except unexpectedly hearing an extremely loud sound that will give me hearing loss. I like the concept and it seems good enough, but I'm having trouble enjoying it. It says I'm going to hear breathing, but I don't really hear anything. I feel like the audio needs to be corrected. Turn the jumpscare noise down, and the "breathing" that is supposed to indicate animatroincs up. Also, I find the lack of full screen annoying. The game keeps crashing. It has even messed my screen up twice to where I couldn't see anything. I couldn't escape the game. The first time I had to shut off my computer, and the second I had to close it and unlock it. It seems to have a lot of problems, and when I feel they're fixed or I better understand the knows cues/get over having my eardrums blown out... I will like the game, but right now... I really don't. I feel as if these problems are addressed then this could probably be one of the best in the series.","July 23, 2015","false","3.2"," 283 of 558 people (51%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","51","283","558","21","12"

Gameplay is challenging like always to keep you on the edge of your seat. I love how the story is built up through the nights until you reach night 5 and finally get the fnaf answers you've been looking for. Some elements are rinse and repeat and after a while you learn the jump scares which overtime makes it less and less scary.

Although, on my computer (which is a Toshiba Sattelite Dual Core Intel(R) Processor) it is a little skippy. Though after defragging it it's smooth as butter. Anyways. This game is the masterpiece of Five Nights at Freddys. Why do I say this? Well first off, I mayorly underestimated this game, which in turn this game scared the sh!t outta me! Second off, I had never played a game where I'm a kid in a house, trying to survive freaks of nature on my bed, plushtrap, Bonnie and Chica at the doors breathing, oh and foxy that rage master, and finally that stupid cupcake that Chica throws at my face. Third Off, the game mechanics are mimics of Five Nights at Candys, but Five Nights at Freddys 4 mimics it perfectly. So good job Scott Cawthon! Just remember (for anyone reading) that this is a horror rage game. Enjoy the game as much as I do.\n\n\nEDIT: NO WAIT DON'T PRESS BUY!!! PLEASE.\nJust don't.

Many people have gripes with the entire franchise, and they are entitled to their opinion. I do in fact wish to defend this game against the haters. Almost all of the haters fail to recognise this one thing: FNAF is a niche franchise. FNAF for all intents and purposes created its genre, and when I say this I am completely disregarding the MANY thousands of god-awful point and click "scary" games that are in all actuality interactive storybooks with 2 cheap jumpscares and noises downloaded from freesound.org. FNAF practically created the standard for point-and-click horror games. It was the first to make a point and click actually scary. When I say scary, keep in mind everybody is scared of different things. FNAF 1 came out when its developer was in a bad place. It was the game that revitalized his career, and he loves doing this. To the people claiming he is milking his cash cow, just no. Scott loves doing this, let him do it. Also, he sells his games for $8, which is very cheap in a market FLOODED with $60 launch titles. He could stand to get away with at least twice what he charges yet he keeps them cheap. Not a milker. Now if you dislike the repetitive gameplay, realize that LOTS of games are repetitive. I once got to talk to a lead dev on the team that made Halo:CE. He said every game at its core is a 5 to 30 second experience repeated indefinitely. COD is like this, FNAF is like this, Halo is like this, Battlefield is like this, etc. FNAF is not bad for being somewhat repetitive. It cant just wildly change how its played a dozen times. It sticks to a tried and true formula that works. But of course you wont like a game if you dont like the core gameplay. Duh.\n\nTLDR:\nFNAF is a game that PRACTICALLY invented its genre. It provided a high standard for games of its type, and FNAF is a fun game series that had 4 unique titles that are all worth their money IMO. This one is the best personally.","July 23, 2015","true","0.3"," 107 of 211 people (51%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","51","107","211","44","1"

Die Atmosphäre ist düster und beklemmend, die Jumpscares besser eingebaut; allgemein ist das Spiel viel flüssiger was natürlich auf die Nerven schlägt.\n\nGanz zu schweigen von der neuen Mechanik: Man muss genau hinhören! Und genau dieser Umstand macht das Spiel viel nervenaufreibender als seine Vorgänger. ''Soll ich das Licht anmachen?'' ''War das ein Roboter, oder spielt mir mein Gehör ein Streich?'' Man muss weniger beachten (keine Kameras, Musikbox, etc.), dennoch muss man die einzelnen Aspekte im Spiel genau anschauen bzw. man muss genau hinhören, denn sonst lebt man nicht lange.\nDies sind nur einige Dinge, die einem fortwährend begleiten. Ganz zu schweigen, das die Jumpscares echt gut sind (ich bin selber beinahe vom Stuhl gefallen).\n\nFür Fans der Serie ein definitives Must-Have\n\n10/10\n\n\nThis game is definitely one of the scariest games in the franchise. The atmosphere is dark and nightmarish, the jumpscares are a more unexpected; in general this game plays much more nerve wracking.\n\nThe new machanics are just great. You really need to listen carefully! '' This game bases only on the sounds which gets more and more stressful through the night. '' Shall I flash my light? Was that a animatronic or just something else?'' All these questions went through my mind when I played this game.\nThere isn't much to do in this game. Just check the closet, bed and the hallways. But that's the tricky part. It's plays slower than the other games and you start to think more and more about this situation which results in getting you more scared. And as I mentioned before, you need to listen closely. Failures aren't tolerated in this game. And the Jumpscares...some don't like it, but I think they're really good and scary in this game...hell, I've just fell of my chair when I got jumpscared^^.\n\nFor fans of the serie a must have!\n\n10/10","July 24, 2015","true","8.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","5"

The game has way better graphics than previous ones. And you can defnitely see it from System Requirements. I got easy 60 FPS, but still better graphics, what make jumpscares more 3D.\n2. Amazing Title Screen! The best in the series (so far lol)\n3. Price. I know it's not the cheapest one, but I was really worried that it might be 10€, but thank god it was 7,99€.\n4. Gameplay. I like this child's home thingie. I disliked it when I saw trailer, but after I played awhile (and watched Youtube vids ofc) I started to like it\n5. Very scary. Scariest one in the series. Jumpscare actually scared the crap out of me -_- And atmosphere feels like you're watching your childhood nightmare.\n\nYeah, positives are over, this game has many flaws and I hope Scott patch them soon so I can update this review.\n\nCons:\n1. Sounds. Don't take me wrong, sound effects are really spooky and jumpscares has scary sound again, but seriously? This breathing thing kinda ruins game experience. My headset is very loud, even with low volume so I need to keep it volume 2%, because for example gun sounds from CSGO are very loud! But this is main problem in this game. Jumpscare volume is way too loud and I can't hear animatronic's breathing because volume is too low. I can't turn it higher as jumpscares would kill my ears :( Yes, I know game's listening feature, but I can't hear any sounds at all. I hope Scott patches this thing. Because this thing made me kill ESC button.\n2. It's windowed fullscreen. Uh, not good.\n3. I said price was the good thing, but it's also bad thing, because I almost feel that I wasted 8 euros.\n4. It was rushed like FNAF3. Coincidence? I don't think so.\n5. I'm still confused what I supposed to do!\n6. Story is great as usual, BUT! It feels like it's nothing to do with basic story. This basically just says that player is victim of Bite of 87. Yep, I warned you. Spoiler Alert. I hope upcoming DLC does something. Because if not looks like we need two more games to tell whole story, if movie doesn't count.\n\nDon't take me wrong. I don't hate this game. I like it so far. But I'm little bit disappointed. But I hope Scott fixes flaws with patch and make October's DLC very interesting. I will update review when patch and DLC comes out :)\n\n7/10\n\nHave Fun with Plushtrap!","July 24, 2015","true","0.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

I played to Night 2. For some reason on my system at least, there are a lot of strange delays in the beginning of the night. It takes several seconds for the flashlight to turn on and the screens to load, and it's a little disorienting and throws off the pace. As well, when the first night ended, my computer kind of went into hysterics, but that might be because of the full screen bug (which I won't harp on since Scott already addressed it).\n\nThe big thing for me is the difficulty. I'm pretty sure I beat Night 1 through sheer luck. I can't figure out the pattern to anything. The audio cues are too scarce a lot of the time, and there just doesn't feel like there's enough feedback for what you're doing right and wrong. The other games I could figure out fairly well.\n\nThese are all minor things in the long run that, if fixed, would make the game perfect. The atmosphere is great. The shortened screams make the jump scares far more frightening. The setting is actually a lot WORSE than the security offices from before. Having to move around adds a whole new layer. It's a scary experience, but it gets watered down so fast because it's so hard to figure out exactly what to do where. Maybe it's just me, and I'm missing something. I've heard you can hear breathing but I've tried several strategies and can't quite find one that works perfectly. Things seem a lot more random. Sometimes nothing happens until 3AM and sometimes Bonnie is waiting for me the second time I check his door 20 seconds in.","July 23, 2015","true","6.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","2"

The first game had an extremely creepy vibe to it, the second one seemed to not have that same vibe. But the third game brought it back, somewhat, and this game just blows it out of the water. And I like that it relies more on auditory queues this time. Taking the security cameras away and putting you in the place of a frightened child seems to give off more of the creepiness, because it's harder to tell when to expect to be jumpscared than the last three games. I won't give any spoilers, but some mysteries are still left unsolved.

I didn't think that this game could be scary, especially after my disappointment with FNAF 3. Boy was I wrong!\n\nCameras are no longer a thing and your only way of knowing where the animatronics are is by listening out for the audio queues and, to me, this was a brilliant design choice. Having to stand there in the doorway, carefully listening out for breathing to make sure it is safe outside is something that is truly terrifying and puts me on edge. The fear of not knowing what you will see when you flick your flashlight on is amazing.\n\nThis game has given me some of the biggest scares I have had in a long time and this is without a doubt the scariest entry in the series yet.","August 3, 2015","true","2.4"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Scott does it again and gives another amazing game designed to make you fall of your chair. The first time I played, not aware of the terrifying consequences that awaited me in the game, I panicked at the tension and quickly got jumpscared of one of the four Nightmare animatronics. This game requires deep concentration and great listening skill to pass all the nights and beat the game... However, this game is made in such a way that if you concentrate and get jumpscared after, it will shock the sense out of you.

What a game indeed...Now, I have about 10 friends that have this game so far.\nThe game itself is very entertaining, and by FAR my most favorite in the series at the moment.\nScott has done a wonderful job with his games (With exception of FNaF 3 in my opinion) so far with such a small amount of time.\nI as a person almost live off this game and it's theories that people make in the lore.\nAlthough the game is good, the lore... IS BETTER!\nThere are so many twists and turns throughout the game\nI have a little table here for you with what I rate everything separately.\n\nPart of the Game        Score                Mechanics        10/10                Design        9/10                Sound        8.5/10\nMechanics: I loved the mechanics in this 4th installment to the FNaF franchise. The flashlight usage, child in his room, listening at the door. It all fit in so well with it's atmosphere. Only thing was that the camera idea was gone... It was the thing that really set the feeling for the games, and it isn't a bad thing necessarily! It is just something crucial to the past games.\n\nDesign: The new "Nightmare" design to these animatronics have me hooked. They are something new and revolution to the feeling of "scary" that Five Nights at Freddy's has introduced so far. The rush of being jump-scared was enough, but this step up from that with a new Hellish look to these already freaky things was the tip of the iceberg to FNaF.\n\nSound: Alright, the sounds of the game were all creepy and atmospheric. There was a few things that made me a little angry... the footsteps of your character were literally re-used sounds from Foxy's run in the first game, the sounds are still a little to quiet for me to be honest, and instead of Scott making a new jump-scare sound affect he just smashed the previous 3 sounds together. Yes, yes, I know it made it seem as if they were Nightmare-like with there voices being mashed together, but I would've preferred a deeper pitched roar compared to a loud scream.\n\nThere is still one thing that I haven't fully gotten into...\n\nThe Lore / Story lineThis game leaves so many new questions unanswered compared to the ones that could've been answered. The Bite of 87 could've been this poor child, or possibly another from a later time or different building. The Purple Guy Easter egg could mean a few different things that I won't get into right now. I love the franchise's lore and I always will, and I will also continue theorizing as much as I can!\n\nNow To / About ScottMy friends tell me that you've made too many mistakes. Mistakes that you can't make up for. Little things that make no sense when compared to things. But I refuse to believe it. Every LITTLE thing that you've done must have some sort of reasoning behind it. I refuse to believe that you make a mistake knowingly or lazily. Show everyone that their wrong your own way, through your brilliant games. You've confirmed FNaF 5 won't be happening anytime soon (Which you NEED to do, just 5NaF5 sounds so cool :P), and a prequel won't be happening either. So DLCs and Spinoffs are bound to happen. I wish the best of luck to all of you out there in the FNaF fandom, and game on!\n\nThese are just my opinions, please don't try to argue with me about what I feel or believe. Thank You :)","August 7, 2015","true","1.5"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","10","19","2","4"

I still think the original character designs are, in a way, creepier than the Nightmare designs.\n\nThe moment I watched the trailer, I had a mixed reaction:\n\n+ A part of me liked the idea of an innovative environment, while bringing back some FNAF 1 mechanics like the double side doors to close. I also loved the idea of slight movement being possible and the possibility to turn around for more than ~90°. In a moment of lucidity I also realized the animations were actually worked upon this time, and I was happy to see that the Jumpscares went back to the quality of the first game (loud, terrifying sound and shaky screen) and upped it to eleven with the animation itself as you can actually see them grab you, and that's important as it increases immersion in the game.\n\n- Another part of me recoiled at the idea of the house environment, which really isn't "Freddy's", and the lack of cameras kinda kills the original FNAF concept in my eyes (although they would make no sense in a house, of course). I also had my doubts on the lore, since it was clear that your character was a child at this point, and guessed, as many other fans, who that child might have been. But that concept stunk in my opinion. If I have to be dead honest, I think Cawthon found several difficulties when making up the story after the first game. As of now, most of it really makes minimal sense, so we either adapt and make assumptions, or we ignore it.\n\nAfter playing the game, I had a more impartial view of the game:\n\nWhile lore-wise I can hardly place it inside of the original FNAF story, I can definitely see this working as a spin-off or a standalone game. While FNAF 2 and 3 actually needed the rest of the series to make any sort of sense, especially 3, this 4th game manages to be interesting by itself, and that's actually positive, since it's so different from the rest of the series anyway.\n\nThe game is way heavier than its previous installments, and is known to lag quite a bit on certain occasions, but it seems nothing game-breaking so far.\n\nI actually liked the decision to give the original cast their role as main enemies (even though in Nightmare form), as they are more or less the true backbone of the FNAF series and the most recognized and loved by the fans. Nightmare Fredbear's design looks astoundingly different from Regular Fredbear's, in a way that lets me barely recognize him, but I can work with that. I have yet to decide what to make of Nightmare honestly, I'd like to know more... but the rest are absolutely fine, even with a major change here and there.\n\nI appreciate the change in rhythm: the previous chapters relied mainly on repetitive mechanics which were to be repeated very quickly and accurately, lest an immediate fail happened. This Final Chapter, instead, decides to take a turn to the Choice theme: it's slower compared to the others, but punishes you heavily for making the wrong choice of action. It's mostly non-linear - the animatronics can appear at random, forcing you to check constanly for their presence - at your sides, in front of you, and BEHIND you.\n\nAnother great positive point: many will agree with the fact that given the limited nature of FNAF, sound had to be a major atmospheric factor. Playing with no sound means missing more than half of any of the games, other than making them unnecessarily more difficult than they already are by default.\nWell, FNAF 4 focuses on sound. Without it, you are assured to lose. And this is very, very significant for a FNAF game, in more ways than one.\n\nSo, to wrap this up: FNAF is and will always be that kind of game that will only appeal to certain tastes (namely, those who want a challenge and to have an open mind instead of letting the game tell them the whole story). Playing and watching are two different experiences, and the game itself is quite cheap and accessible, especially during major Steam sales. You'll love or hate this game, rarely just like or dislike, or even more rarely be neutral about it.\n\nAs a fan or the horror genre, I absolutely recommend giving it a shot, as no matter how many FNAFs come out, each one of them manages to be unique in its own way.","July 28, 2015","true","2.2"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","52","15","29","4","7"

Perhaps I'm disenchanted because I've played them all and each one after the 2nd sequel seemed unnecessary and redundant to my vapid, jaded disposition.\n\nThe same game mechanic of doors and lights are back with bitter vengeance along with a very unwelcomed partner: audio cues in the form of undead breathing.  That's right, you have to listen and shut the door praying whatever animatronic is after you gets bored and slinks away.  On the week this game was initially released, it was total luck if you heard any breathing at all before hesitating to shine your light down a hallway or shut the door.  Shutting the door when nobody was there garnered unwanted attention and shining the light on any character at your door meant you were as good as dead.  Imagine the frustration maximizing your computer's volume to hear no breathing, then succumb to the loudest jump scare of your life. Luckily this problem has since been fixed, so maybe you won't go half as deaf with headphones now as you would have previously.  I hope you aren't afraid of the tiny Freddy's on your bed, because you have to do the opposite and shine your light on them without hesitation to scare them off.  Foxy is as unbearable as ever, thanks to the screech he offers upon finding him in the closet for the first time or when he's neglected.  Shut the closet doors and count to 10 to neutralize him, if you don't, Foxy will be the last character you see come out of the closet (closeted homosexuality joke quota fulfilled).  There's so many more details to go into but put simply is your timing and prioritization is off by even a millisecond you will die.\n\nOn a tangent, the plushtrap mini-game seems out of place in this game.  It's not part of the main story, and although it beating it lets you skip 2 hours on the following night, I could never grasp the idea of how to win this based on auditory cues.\n\nThe plot is as ambiguous as ever providing little details between every weeknight in quasi-eight-bit cut scenes.  You play as a boy who doesn't like Freddy Fazbear's anymore after seeing something bad go on there (what exactly you saw isn't made very clear).  Each night counts down to your inevitable birthday at Freddy's and as a result of your older brother and his friends, your head gets lodged in Fredbear's mouth where you are crushed to death.  (Don’t even get me started on what happens on nights 6 and 7, I’ll hit my character limit).  Many players initially thought this was the bite of 1987, but an Easter egg in one of the Atari-esque plot scenes reveals that it might actually be another incident that occurred in 1983.  Turning on the television in your house reveals a Fazbear TV show or commercial whose copyright is 1983, but we may never know for sure what this means until another sequel or DLC comes out for this franchise.  -Oh dear god, take a break Scott Cawthon!  This is the fourth game you've made in the length of a whole year.  Have you ever heard of taking a break or doing things in moderation?  I certainly guess not.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, you might have better enjoyment watching somebody else play this game on a YouTube video or when you’re hanging out with your friends.  Getting this game at this point in time seems like a pretty nonsensical decision, especially since the original was better.","September 30, 2015","false","15.9"," 22 of 43 people (51%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","51","22","43","4","5"

In this one, you can scare the animatronics away using your flashlight, which I believe has unlimited use. When you check a door, you must wait a couple seconds before deciding whether you will use the flashlight, or hold the door shut. You must hold the door shut if you hear any breathing whatsoever, until you hear no more. However, if you close the door while an animatronic is at the END of the hall, it will bring them next to the door, and the next time you use the flashlight on the door, it will jumpscare you (which, by the way, is about 100 times scarier than the other ones, just a heads up). Also, when you close the door, you must HOLD it shut, instead of letting it stay closed like before, and since you can only check on one thing at time, you  cannot keep multiple doors closed at once. You must also check behind you, where the little Freddies lurk. The little Freddies are actually very simple. They will come over time, so you must eventually constantly check behind you. With the Freddies, you simply hold your flashlight on until all of them disappear. Don't be afraid to check behind you when you need to, as this game is meant to be taken quite slowly as opposed to the games prior. I haven't actually encountered Foxy, but I've been told you must check the closet when your flashlight flickers. Then you must shine the light in, and if he is there, you hold it shut.\nThe Atmosphere:\n\nOh God, the atmosphere. The game's atmosphere definitely is terrifying for a couple reasons. First, there is no Phone Guy to comfort you. I always felt that PG was very comforting, as at least it wasn't silent. In fact, I didn't even want to play the first one on night 4 because he "dies" on it. Also the noise of the fun running. There is still the fan (which is purple, maybe a hint to something), but it isn't running. Second, the lighting. There is no light whatsoever, except for the flashlight. No hall light, no room light, nothing. Whenever you go to check something, it's pitch black until you turn on the flashlight.\nThe Graphics:\n\nThere's really not much to say about the graphics. They're pretty much the same as all the others, with maybe a slight enhancement here and there, but other than that, not much else.\n\nI think that pretty much wraps it up. For those of you who get scared easily, this game is not for you. It's very different than all the other games, with the atmosphere, gameplay, and the mechanics, but I would say it's very solid.\n\n10/10 would check the door again.\n\n\n\n\n","July 27, 2015","true","6.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I love the new 'Fun with Plushtrap' minigame that allows you to skip 2 hours in the night, that was an amazing idea by Scott. This game focuses on hearing (Headphones are recommended as they can help tell which side an animatronic is at). To keep away the animatronics you must listen for their breathing. If you hear the breathing you must close the door as quickly as possible until they leave. If you don't hear breathing, you flash the light to scare them away down the hall. Since the game is based so heavily on listening an waiting, it makes it even scarier when an animatronic jumpscares you. The game also has the most nights out of any game, but a custom night would have been amazing. The game handle's really well, has amazing graphics, sounds and music, and has you gasping and screaming almost every second of the way.

It will take a few days for any possible bugs to be worked out. Scott works very hard on these games, and you can't expect them to be 100% perfectly smooth running when they first come out. The only way to find problems is to have people test the system. A great example is the full screen issue which Scott is already working on.\n\n\nLong story short, yes it has a few very minor issues, but know that Scott can get them straightened out, and once he does, Five Nights At Freddy's 4 will be the best game in the series so far.\n\n10/10 I would recommend this game to friends, but I would suggest that they bear with it till the bugs are worked out (which hopefully won't be long).\n\n\nCan't wait to see what the DLC has in store for us.","July 23, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

But I'm kinda iffy on playing it, I really don't wanna feel like I wasted 8 dollars by just having it sitting in my Library, so I'm just gonna wait until the Breathing is made a bit louder, because it is really hard to hear it. So until the bugs are fixed, I'll only play it with people around because I'm bad with scary games. GJ SCOTT.\n\nHelpful Part:\nI suggest getting the game. If you're gonna buy the game, don't judge it yet. It was only released yesterday, and people are hating on it already; Bugs this, Bugs that, this isn't working, that isn't loud enough. PEOPLE PLEASE, give Scott a chance to work out any standing bugs. I would recomemend waiting a bit before getting the game so you get the best out of it.\nLook at other reviews before buying the game. If people are saying bad things about it, it would be best not to get it until things are worked out.\nWait a bit before using your flashlight. If you hear ANYTHING you should close the door for a few seconds, then open and flash your light. If you are not good with jumpscares, but really wanna get the game, watch videos to learn the best way to avoid the scares, or be like me, and have a friend or family member with you while playing, it might make you feel better.","July 24, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm doing good." And then Bonnie apears. This is acctually the first FNaF game in a year that got me scared. FNaF 1 did but not anymore. After Bonnie, I closed out of the game, instantly. You play as a kid, trying to survive till his party. And you have anamatronics in your house for some reason. Just play the game...\n\nI am going back to edit this now and saying, this is now the only FNaF game that acctually had me on the edge of seat while playing and shamefully admiting, minor crying of fear (One or two tears). I ending up screaming "HOLY ----!" at 1:22 AM. You did it Mr. Cawthon, you finally broke me. This is now the only game I refuse to play out of fear.

Even when Foxy was in the closet, it still scared me!\n\nMy rating: 8/10\n+Graphics are good\n+Sound effects make the atmosphere tense\n+Jumpscares are intense\n+Breathing sounds are clear\n\n-Black bars either side of the screen in the main menu\n-Your volume must be loud to hear breathing\n-Some problems broadcasting gameplay\n\nOverall, I recommend this game. Even though you might get a little deaf after this, it's definitely worth it!","August 9, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Unlike in the other games, you can't really anticipate when the jumpscare is coming, so they stay fresh and get you every time! Althoug sometimes the jumpscare has to load and the screen goes black for a while, in which case you know EXACTLY what is about to happen... Whcih brings me onto my first complaint - loading times. Each night takes from 30 seconds to a full 5 minutes to load, aswell as in game animations, which take about 10 seconds to load at the start of a night. It may not seem like much, but whith the speed of the animatronics you need every second to put towards keeping them away... Whcih brings me onto my second issue: the game gets too hard too quickly. Night 1 and 2 were quite good, but then at night three you are thrown into a literal torrent of jumpscares. I am a very casual gamer and, as such, struggle trying to get past 1am in night 3! I think a difficulty setting should be incorporated (e.g. an easy, medium and hard) so people like me can finish the game. Finally, for some reason, the game won't fill my full screen, even when I press F11. This is only a minor issue. However, despite this, I will continue to try my best to complete it, even if I can't get past night 3, for the brilliant, smooth gameplay that is new to FNaF. I look forward to the DLC and can't wait to find out everything about the backstory! Overall, a very good game that meets up and exceeds standards that you may want to play if your computer is beefier than mine (which isn't too great...) and you can take the jumpscares! Edit: Well, Scott has fixed the full screen isuue! Now i just have to click 'continue' to see if it loads faster! Oh dear.... Ehem, no that that is a problem, having to play it or anything.... DEFINITELY not because it is so scary or anything, he he, erm..","July 24, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"

This is easily in the top 2 of my favourite FNAF games. Still to be completed, but night 5 isn't a walk in the park right now!\n\nThe only thing I'm not enjoying about this game so far is that there's two extremes to the volumes: On the one hand you're raising your awareness for this supposed 'breathing' noise I can't seem to make out, and on the other, said risen awareness plus extremely loud jumpscare equals  a really bad headache.\n\nAs the game stands right now, it's pretty awesome, I'm impressed with this one, and is well on the way to being the best in the series - the graphics are awesome, the concept is awesome, everything about the look and feel of the game so far is awesome, but the flashlight sticks sometimes which sucks, and I'm not willing to risk my hearing just so I can deficate myself. If the other aspects of the game are good enough, you don't need loud noises to scare people - If you want that, I suggest any horror story mod on Garry's Mod.","July 23, 2015","true","18.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

You did so great on this game series it breaks my heart to her the title of the game (which is Five Nights At Freddy's 4 The Final Chapter) and I remeber most of everyones reaction when the FIrst one came out and when I played it on my mobile device when bonnie popped up and scared the living daylight out if me I literally dropped my phone,  Then I found out you were making a 2nd game and I bought it the day it came out and the way you changed the game series it was mind blowing ive never seen any game developer do that I was mind blown. Then the 3rd one came and at this time this game became an internet sensation and i saw the trailer and literally said "Shut up and take my money" and played it and found all the secrets and my brain was spinning I was going on google to see for anything. I was doing everything to find out the backstory to this great game I never did find it but i do hope it gets solved in the 4th and final one (even tho I hope its not the end). Then today July 24th 2015 I was going through my subscribtions and I see "Markiplier ARE YOU BRAVE ENOUGH? / Five Nights At Freddy's 4 - Part 1" and he said its the demo and I was like dangit then his 2nd episode came out and he said "its out NOW" I then ran to my computer and checked steam and it said "Five Nights At Freddy's 4 8.00$" I asked for it right away and started to play it. I was talking to a friend while playing and shined my left to the right door and saw Bonnie run away and closed the game and told my friend "I cant do this" and he started to laugh he then had to talk to his mom. I started to play I made it on night 2 I was shaking then the closet moved I went to it  and Foxy jumpscared me I started to shake so bad it looked like I was picking up a fever I was shacking so bad I beat the night and needed to take a breather I came back upstairs and wrought this giangantic review. So this giant review is more like a giant thank you to Scott because without him scary games wouldnt be as fun as they are im not that big on scary games but this game is so fun that I dont care how much I get scared so thanks Scott so much and good luck on your next game I will take a look at your next game you do but no mater waht you will be in my book of best game creator. GOOD LUCK SCOTT.","July 24, 2015","true","2.8"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","8","16","5","0"

The final chapter of the Five Nights at Freddy's... quadrilogy, I guess you'd call it, unless you'd count the Five Nights movie coming out some time soon. Scott has always managed to create, well, not necessarily good since 3 was kind of meh, but interesting games with a neat little backstory to them that webs the games together into an interesting little plot. With the pretty good 1, the less impressive but still decent 2, and the kind of meh 3 that at least was a lot better than it could've been, Scott managed to create a massive fanbase around the little franchise that could, and yeah, I have to admit I am part of that group. I was looking forward to this game and I was saving up to get the last game on Halloween since I enjoyed the last 3 enough and liked the franchise, but apparently we decided that Halloween was on July 23rd and Scott released it then. So yeah, I had to frantically collect some money and got it a month or two later. Then I got distracted by Metal Gear Solid 5 and I kind of still am distracted by that now, but I played this on and off to assemble a review like I did for the last 3. So what did I think? Let's see.\n\nSTORY: You're an unnamed kid. Have no idea what he's named, so I'll call him Bob. In the middle of the night, Bob is woken up from his slumber and finds that animatronics are trying to get him, so you have to deal with all of them from 12AM to 6AM. That's the basic gameplay plot, and while it is neat that this franchise steps away from anything pizzeria related, that bit is kind of lame, though granted, I don't have as many problems with this than I do with Mike Schmidt going back each night to a job where he could be killed and stuffed into a suit and other problems with the general pizzeria problems. There are those 8-bit minigames between each night, which tells the story of the kid you play as and his bully brother, which is a bit more interesting and tells a lot about the lore. Overall, same kind of underwhelming plot held up by the decent lore that keeps it worth playing.\n\nGAMEPLAY: No more cameras here in Five Nights 4, which is kind of lame and I do really miss them, and I think Scott could've perfected the system if he did it again, but I get why he didn't do that. You have to check the two hallways on either side of your room for animatronics. You flash your flashlight down the hallway to check and see if any of the animatronics are down there. If they're at the end of the hall, they'll screw off and you'll be fine for now. If they're right at your door, you will get jumpscared. In order to prevent this, you need to listen for any breathing to see if they're there. If yes, you have to shut the door and wait for them to go. If not, flash the light. Foxy will sometimes sneak his way into your closet if you don't scare him off, in which case you have to do the same thing there. You have to check your bed behind you as well in order to prevent Freddy from manifesting and attacking you. In later nights you'll get a single animatronic who is incredibly aggressive and you have to prevent him from him getting in. The gameplay is the tensest it gets since FN2 and it isn't as aggrevating as it is in 2, which is nice. I still think 2 is a bit more fun than this, but I don't care necessarily as long as it's good, which I say it is.\n\nGRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCE: I can't tell the framerate on this game since the Steam Overlay that I use to check with these games doesn't work with this game for some reason, but it runs smoothly enough. The game looks decent enough, it isn't exactly a high quality 4K resolution game or anything like that, but it does the job well enough.\n\nCHARACTERS AND VOICE ACTING: You have six, kind of seven animatronics to deal with, though most nights you only have to deal with 3 or 4 and the others are just one basically. The usual four animatronics; Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, are in here, they look pretty freaky, Scott went all out with their designs here, and they are creepy. There's also a Nightmare Golden Freddy and an animatronic simply named Nightmare, who are variants of the Freddy design. They are both pretty damn creepy, but I think one is just a recoloring of the other. Oh yeah, and there's a cupcake that kills you if you just stand around and do nothing. ♥♥♥♥ing emberassing way to go, I know. One thing that makes sense but I still kind of miss is that Phone Guy didn't make an appearance here, I liked the aspect of figuring out what basically to do from his phone calls instead of that lazy popup that told you what to do and how to do it. There isn't really any voice acting unless you count the jumpscare noises, but I think those are just modified versions of stock sound effects.\n\nEXTRAS: When you beat the main 5 nights, you get access to Night 6. Once you beat that you unlock a Nightmare mode and some extras. There is a hidden 20/20/20/20 mode that you get if you type "20202020" in the game, good freaking luck with that, I'm still on Night 6. xD Scott'll add some stuff on Halloween, at least that's what he said, though my money is that he releases it later this month. Can't wait to see if the movie follows the same logic xD There's also a "Fun With Springtrap" minigame between each night, and if beaten correctly, shaves two whole hours off your night, which is a really big help.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS: Scariest game out of the 4, though to be honest I liked the first one a lot more and I had a bit less fun than I did in FN2. 7/10, it's a decent horror game, if you didn't like the last three games this might change your mind, though it's unlikely. Fans of the franchise already have this game, so I don't need to convince you guys. Anyone who's neutral on it, I say this one or FN1 is your best way to enter this franchise, but 1, 2, and 4 I can definately say that you can get these on Halloween and enjoy them. Maybe 3.\n\nNow, there's only one question that needs answering in the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise. https://youtu.be/1giVzxyoclE?t=119","September 26, 2015","true","1.9"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","6","12","2","0"

Call me a baby if you will, The breathing when you go to the door is deep and evil and it creeps me out, there are allot of outdoor noises that can confuse me but that makes the game allot more fun to play.\n\nScott, congrats i really enjoyed this series and from what i have played so far, this one is my number 1 out the 4. I hope to see more games from you after this, don't dissapear.\n\nNow, time to talk about some pros and cons\n\n\nPros:\nThe atmospher is chilling and dark adding to the thrill of this game, no complaints\n\nSound is wonderful and very chilling, i have seen no problems when it comes to sound\n\nThe jumpscares are great and new, detail on the characters is wonderful\n\nAnmation of the characters are smooth and chilling\n\ni could go on  but i will keep this short\n\n\nCons:\n\nSwitching from area to area can be slowl when you first begin but it speeds up quickly\n\nfull screen is a bit wack but easy to fix\n\n.............................................................\n\nthats really it, im sure all of the errors will be fixed, so people who complain need to chill...you try making a game and make it work, see how well you do.

After booting it up and playing for a few minutes, I discovered a few bugs. Upon booting the game, instead of going into fullscreen like I assume it's supposed to, it instead began running in a window and changed my entire computer's resolution. Second, after booting up and fixing the resolution, the game told me to turn my volume up until I could hear the sound of crickets in the background. I wound up turning it all the way to max volume before I finally heard them, and even then just barely. And finally, a slight issue during gameplay. When the animation played that showed the player running to the doors, the game would freeze for a few seconds. I also encountered a similar problem when trying to look at the bed. However, instead of showing the animation right away, the game froze for a solid fifteen seconds before it finally registered.\n\nIn my opinion, Scott should not have released this game early. Then he likely would have found and fixed these problems. I still recommend this game, but only after Scott fixes these bugs with an update.","July 23, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I imagined Scott would've gone with the normalities, but he really threw that out with the finale. I found myself completely terrified from the moment I opened up the game. I give props to Scott for creating a genre changing franchise. I've have nightmares for years.

The new sound based mechanic introduced adds alot of tension to the atomsphere of the game, also the removal of cameras induces panic. However the noise ques used in this "new mechanic" are hard to hear making the game much harder and much less fun. Hopefully  Scott Cawthon will update the game and make these noises easier to hear  .

However, the main action within the game does not take place within the pizzeria like the last three games did, instead, it takes place in a normal house that belongs to a child whose story is told as the game progresses. But, this change of location is refreshing and it works really well. The normality of the setting helps set in the fear factor for the player, and can make them believe that they are susceptible to attacks such as these in their own home. The first game especially was lauded for taking place in a familiar setting for players (a restaurant with animatronics), but this is only a setting which is familiar to some players. I myself am British, so I am not familiar with animatronic pizza restaurants, but the setting here opens up the fear factor to EVERYONE. I haven't played the entire game, so don't ask me what gets answered and what doesn't. And if one part of the Five Nights at Freddy's mystery isn't solved, never fear! Scott Cawthon will be releasing a major update on Halloween 2015, which presumably may have a new setting to play in.\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic game with a great deal of depth and thought having gone into it, and the scares most definitely are there. I don't want to spoil the game for you, go and play it and experience it for yourself!","July 24, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The final chapter of the Five Nights at Freddy's... quadrilogy, I guess you'd call it, unless you'd count the Five Nights movie coming out some time soon. Scott has always managed to create, well, not necessarily good since 3 was kind of meh, but interesting games with a neat little backstory to them that webs the games together into an interesting little plot. With the pretty good 1, the less impressive but still decent 2, and the kind of meh 3 that at least was a lot better than it could've been, Scott managed to create a massive fanbase around the little franchise that could, and yeah, I have to admit I am part of that group. I was looking forward to this game and I was saving up to get the last game on Halloween since I enjoyed the last 3 enough and liked the franchise, but apparently we decided that Halloween was on July 23rd and Scott released it then. So yeah, I had to frantically collect some money and got it a month or two later. Then I got distracted by Metal Gear Solid 5 and I kind of still am distracted by that now, but I played this on and off to assemble a review like I did for the last 3. So what did I think? Let's see.\n\nSTORY: You're an unnamed kid. Have no idea what he's named, so I'll call him Bob. In the middle of the night, Bob is woken up from his slumber and finds that animatronics are trying to get him, so you have to deal with all of them from 12AM to 6AM. That's the basic gameplay plot, and while it is neat that this franchise steps away from anything pizzeria related, that bit is kind of lame, though granted, I don't have as many problems with this than I do with Mike Schmidt going back each night to a job where he could be killed and stuffed into a suit and other problems with the general pizzeria problems. There are those 8-bit minigames between each night, which tells the story of the kid you play as and his bully brother, which is a bit more interesting and tells a lot about the lore. Overall, same kind of underwhelming plot held up by the decent lore that keeps it worth playing.\n\nGAMEPLAY: No more cameras here in Five Nights 4, which is kind of lame and I do really miss them, and I think Scott could've perfected the system if he did it again, but I get why he didn't do that. You have to check the two hallways on either side of your room for animatronics. You flash your flashlight down the hallway to check and see if any of the animatronics are down there. If they're at the end of the hall, they'll screw off and you'll be fine for now. If they're right at your door, you will get jumpscared. In order to prevent this, you need to listen for any breathing to see if they're there. If yes, you have to shut the door and wait for them to go. If not, flash the light. Foxy will sometimes sneak his way into your closet if you don't scare him off, in which case you have to do the same thing there. You have to check your bed behind you as well in order to prevent Freddy from manifesting and attacking you. In later nights you'll get a single animatronic who is incredibly aggressive and you have to prevent him from him getting in. The gameplay is the tensest it gets since FN2 and it isn't as aggrevating as it is in 2, which is nice. I still think 2 is a bit more fun than this, but I don't care necessarily as long as it's good, which I say it is.\n\nGRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCE: I can't tell the framerate on this game since the Steam Overlay that I use to check with these games doesn't work with this game for some reason, but it runs smoothly enough. The game looks decent enough, it isn't exactly a high quality 4K resolution game or anything like that, but it does the job well enough.\n\nCHARACTERS AND VOICE ACTING: You have six, kind of seven animatronics to deal with, though most nights you only have to deal with 3 or 4 and the others are just one basically. The usual four animatronics; Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, are in here, they look pretty freaky, Scott went all out with their designs here, and they are creepy. There's also a Nightmare Golden Freddy and an animatronic simply named Nightmare, who are variants of the Freddy design. They are both pretty damn creepy, but I think one is just a recoloring of the other. Oh yeah, and there's a cupcake that kills you if you just stand around and do nothing. ♥♥♥♥ing emberassing way to go, I know. One thing that makes sense but I still kind of miss is that Phone Guy didn't make an appearance here, I liked the aspect of figuring out what basically to do from his phone calls instead of that lazy popup that told you what to do and how to do it. There isn't really any voice acting unless you count the jumpscare noises, but I think those are just modified versions of stock sound effects.\n\nEXTRAS: When you beat the main 5 nights, you get access to Night 6. Once you beat that you unlock a Nightmare mode and some extras. There is a hidden 20/20/20/20 mode that you get if you type "20202020" in the game, good freaking luck with that, I'm still on Night 6. xD Scott'll add some stuff on Halloween, at least that's what he said, though my money is that he releases it later this month. Can't wait to see if the movie follows the same logic xD There's also a "Fun With Springtrap" minigame between each night, and if beaten correctly, shaves two whole hours off your night, which is a really big help.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS: Scariest game out of the 4, though to be honest I liked the first one a lot more and I had a bit less fun than I did in FN2. 7/10, it's a decent horror game, if you didn't like the last three games this might change your mind, though it's unlikely. Fans of the franchise already have this game, so I don't need to convince you guys. Anyone who's neutral on it, I say this one or FN1 is your best way to enter this franchise, but 1, 2, and 4 I can definately say that you can get these on Halloween and enjoy them. Maybe 3.\n\nNow, there's only one question that needs answering in the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise. https://youtu.be/1giVzxyoclE?t=119","September 26, 2015","true","1.9"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","6","12","2","0"

Five Nights at Freddy's 4 creates the feeling of being a little kid, scared of monsters in your closet. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a nice jumpscare (;","February 20","true","9.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

Y finalmente Scott nos ha traido este juego como el ultimo y el que aclarara todas nuestras dudas, aqui va:\n\nLo bueno:\n\n-El rediseño de los animatronics\n-La nueva mecanica del sonido\n-Dificultad\n-La cantidad de noches (8) y el proximo dlc que saldra en hallowen\n-El minijuego de plushtrap le da algo diferente\n\nLo malo:\n\n-Nos quedamos con algunas dudas apesar de ser el que nos las iba a responder\n-Peca en lo mismo de los otros 3 anteriores: Repetitivo\n-¿Que paso con los graficos?\n-Los problemas que tiene con la pantalla\n\nCalificacion: 6.5/10.

Night 3, and I'm more terrified than ever. Jumpscares, sure, but these are done so well that they do not deserve the crap jumpscares normally get. Gameplay is fantastic. Not having cameras is horrible and makes you feel isolated, which adds to the terror, and knowing Freddy is always right behind, "chargin his attack" is the worst. Running back and forth is also a great aspect, as it makes the gameplay more personal. Scott Cawthon, you outdid yourself.

You did so great on this game series it breaks my heart to her the title of the game (which is Five Nights At Freddy's 4 The Final Chapter) and I remeber most of everyones reaction when the FIrst one came out and when I played it on my mobile device when bonnie popped up and scared the living daylight out if me I literally dropped my phone,  Then I found out you were making a 2nd game and I bought it the day it came out and the way you changed the game series it was mind blowing ive never seen any game developer do that I was mind blown. Then the 3rd one came and at this time this game became an internet sensation and i saw the trailer and literally said "Shut up and take my money" and played it and found all the secrets and my brain was spinning I was going on google to see for anything. I was doing everything to find out the backstory to this great game I never did find it but i do hope it gets solved in the 4th and final one (even tho I hope its not the end). Then today July 24th 2015 I was going through my subscribtions and I see "Markiplier ARE YOU BRAVE ENOUGH? / Five Nights At Freddy's 4 - Part 1" and he said its the demo and I was like dangit then his 2nd episode came out and he said "its out NOW" I then ran to my computer and checked steam and it said "Five Nights At Freddy's 4 8.00$" I asked for it right away and started to play it. I was talking to a friend while playing and shined my left to the right door and saw Bonnie run away and closed the game and told my friend "I cant do this" and he started to laugh he then had to talk to his mom. I started to play I made it on night 2 I was shaking then the closet moved I went to it  and Foxy jumpscared me I started to shake so bad it looked like I was picking up a fever I was shacking so bad I beat the night and needed to take a breather I came back upstairs and wrought this giangantic review. So this giant review is more like a giant thank you to Scott because without him scary games wouldnt be as fun as they are im not that big on scary games but this game is so fun that I dont care how much I get scared so thanks Scott so much and good luck on your next game I will take a look at your next game you do but no mater waht you will be in my book of best game creator.

But this, this is a whole new level. Amazing story that sticks with you, great animations, chilling atmosphere, and of course, the jumpscares. These jumpscares give little to no warning and can really surprise you. This game is very good at scaring with more than just jumpscares. but anticipation. Every time you turn on the flashlight you cringe. Everytime you look behind you and then turn around again, you want to momentarily turn down the volume. And just when you think you have a handle on the system, Scott throws a curveball to make you change how you play. Great game!

I'm not supposed to be playing this game anyways because jumpscares are my worst enemy, but it's the fact that this game induces some real suspense is what makes this game so great. I couldn't get past Night 3 due to the sound cues being too low (and I did have a huge problem with how you have to listen very closely only to not being able to hear the sound cue and then blasted with that louddddd jumpscare.) But now I'm able to get through it easier, experimenting the sounds, and the update did help.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/accordingtoprophecyfromyoutube/recommended/388090/","accordingtoprophecyfromyoutube","According to Prophecy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/accordingtoprophecyfromyoutube/","32 products in account","The Gameplay:\n\nThe gameplay is actually quite complicated compared to the other games. In this one, you can scare the animatronics away using your flashlight, which I believe has unlimited use. When you check a door, you must wait a couple seconds before deciding whether you will use the flashlight, or hold the door shut. You must hold the door shut if you hear any breathing whatsoever, until you hear no more. However, if you close the door while an animatronic is at the END of the hall, it will bring them next to the door, and the next time you use the flashlight on the door, it will jumpscare you (which, by the way, is about 100 times scarier than the other ones, just a heads up). Also, when you close the door, you must HOLD it shut, instead of letting it stay closed like before, and since you can only check on one thing at time, you  cannot keep multiple doors closed at once. You must also check behind you, where the little Freddies lurk. The little Freddies are actually very simple. They will come over time, so you must eventually constantly check behind you. With the Freddies, you simply hold your flashlight on until all of them disappear. Don't be afraid to check behind you when you need to, as this game is meant to be taken quite slowly as opposed to the games prior. I haven't actually encountered Foxy, but I've been told you must check the closet when your flashlight flickers. Then you must shine the light in, and if he is there, you hold it shut.\nThe Atmosphere:\n\nOh God, the atmosphere. The game's atmosphere definitely is terrifying for a couple reasons. First, there is no Phone Guy to comfort you. I always felt that PG was very comforting, as at least it wasn't silent. In fact, I didn't even want to play the first one on night 4 because he "dies" on it. Also the noise of the fun running. There is still the fan (which is purple, maybe a hint to something), but it isn't running. Second, the lighting. There is no light whatsoever, except for the flashlight. No hall light, no room light, nothing. Whenever you go to check something, it's pitch black until you turn on the flashlight.\nThe Graphics:\n\nThere's really not much to say about the graphics. They're pretty much the same as all the others, with maybe a slight enhancement here and there, but other than that, not much else.\n\nI think that pretty much wraps it up. For those of you who get scared easily, this game is not for you. It's very different than all the other games, with the atmosphere, gameplay, and the mechanics, but I would say it's very solid.\n\n10/10 would check the door again.\n\n\n\n\n","July 27, 2015","true","6.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You play as a child who has been having nightmares of the original animatronics (and a few surprise ones!) and you must defend yourself by checking everywhere in your room and close the doors when you hear breathing outside but if you flash your light to soon or to late you will get the scare of your life!\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best in the series because it refines the mechanics from the first game and adds a bit from the others to make what is possibly the most tense FNaF game ever! Whenever i go to a door i get anxious because i know i need to wait for breathing before using the light or closing the door but just waiting there scares the crap out of me and even more so the jumpscare...","July 30, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is easily in the top 2 of my favourite FNAF games. Still to be completed, but night 5 isn't a walk in the park right now!\n\nThe only thing I'm not enjoying about this game so far is that there's two extremes to the volumes: On the one hand you're raising your awareness for this supposed 'breathing' noise I can't seem to make out, and on the other, said risen awareness plus extremely loud jumpscare equals  a really bad headache.\n\nAs the game stands right now, it's pretty awesome, I'm impressed with this one, and is well on the way to being the best in the series - the graphics are awesome, the concept is awesome, everything about the look and feel of the game so far is awesome, but the flashlight sticks sometimes which sucks, and I'm not willing to risk my hearing just so I can deficate myself. If the other aspects of the game are good enough, you don't need loud noises to scare people - If you want that, I suggest any horror story mod on Garry's Mod.","July 23, 2015","true","18.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/42456/recommended/388090/","42456","Elite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/42456/","11 products in account","The tensest moment in Five Nights at Freddy s 4 is a one-second lean. I m leaning out of a child s bedroom, a sharp departure from the Formica wasteland of Freddy Fazbear s pizzeria, peering down a hallway swallowed in darkness. I may as well be staring into a lion s mouth. When I risk a glance out one of the two flanking doors into the dark corridors beyond, my perspective skews unnervingly. I can imagine my hands hugging the wall, an ostensible anchor against the nightmares bumping in the blackness.\n\nNothing jumps out at me this time. The moment passes, and it's back to the same movements and mouse-clicks I ve repeated dozens of times before. I should ve yawned five minutes ago, but soon I m once more forcing my heart back down my throat for my next peek outside. This repeats for quite some minutes. If FNAF 4 needed a box blurb, it d read something like a rollercoaster of apprehension.\n\nFNAF 4 s composition is another rivet in the series steel-clad design which immortalized its Let s Play legacy in a few short months: five 8-minute nights of staying put in a room while fending off a quick death (and a nasty jumpscare) from creepy, walking animatronic animals using careful surveillance and snappily blocking access to whatever shuffles close. Loud screeches and terrifying robotic visages are common, so a strong resolve helps. Mostly.\n\nBoy meets demon\nAbove anything, developer Scott Cawthon s tenacity at constantly tweaking his formula for horror is almost Kubrickian in its meticulousness. FNAF 4 s fundamentals stay firmly acquainted—a familiarly symmetrical room; the reprise of Bonnie, Chica, Freddy, and Foxy as primary antagonists; the usage of doors as a primary defensive mechanic—but its differences offer a refreshing new presentation of the risk-reward seesaw of its predecessors.\n\nReplacing the ever-troubled pizzeria from previous games is the nighttime bedroom of a kid who both substitutes for the hilariously underpaid security guard as the main character and clearly establishes his traumatic phobia of Freddy s friends with a constant Binding-of-Isaac-esque flow of tears. In a flagrant flouting of the status quo, the camera system is removed entirely. Checking for an impending attack involves running up to a door, leaning out, and clicking on a flashlight (thankfully with unlimited battery power) or slamming the door shut at the precise moment I anticipate something lunging for me.\n\nAs before, staying alive demands familiarization with each animatronic s behavior. Where sight and constant camera tracking facilitated this in earlier games, FNAF 4 tosses that away for a different angle: sound. Audio cues—muffled footsteps, the metallic tinkling of shifting kitchen pans, a huff of breath from something Right Beside You—indicate when to use the flashlight or seal a doorway. Being proactive is essential; a single mistake invariably delivers a booming fright. I liked that avoidance of randomness in failure, as my actions and choices solely contributed to whether or not I d soon jump out of my chair.\n\nAnd that s really what Cawthon is best at: ensuring crystallized snapshots of stomach-dropping terror. FNAF 4 uses the sensitivity of your senses to prod out a panicked yelp every time. Does it work? Absolutely. It s absurdly rudimentary: straining to hear something barely above a whisper connects into a skull-shaking blast of sound and a horrible monster face stretched across the monitor. Of course it works.\n\nA minigame involving a plushified version of Springtrap can shave two hours off each night.\nBut it s a bit worrisome to see an overall pivot away from what made the series so attractive in favor of a single, static mechanical loop across all five nights. The camera system, although imperfect—as later nights grew more difficult, staring too long at the video screen likely meant death—greatly defined the series identity. In FNAF 2, checking vents and winding the music box were integral counterparts to the cameras. FNAF 3 piled on the sinister inevitability of tracking a stalking killer.\n\nIn many ways, the Five Nights games require a certain respect for their atmospheric lore, a twisted menagerie of cloudy dates, murder mysteries, and inter-relationships nearly as spaghettified as a Metal Gear Solid cutscene. Stepping into Freddy s world, like flipping open a King novel or tuning into a Carpenter classic, is an investment in putting aside disbelief and reveling in the supernatural guesswork of the genre. That s sadly tougher to pull off in Five Nights at Freddy s 4; the humdrum repetition of the same sequence over and over—door, listen, flashlight, repeat—is too much of a chore to fully pull me in. It s certainly the scariest of the four, but the subtle uneasiness and self-doubt so tellingly accomplished in its older brothers is diminished.","August 20, 2015","true","8.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","3","6","2","1"

Five Nights at Freddy's 4 effectively delivers a decent finale to the series. In this game, you're basically playing as an unamed child, confined to your bedroom in your own house, and not possessing any cameras to view the animatronics on. Obviously, we can already tell this game is different from the others, who had you playing as a security guard in a pizzeria or horror attraction. The animatronics themselves look terrifying, with sharp teeth and claws. Plus, the minigames that occur after each night seem to explain the events of the Bite of 87, a crucial plot point in the game's vague lore and backstory. I won't spoil anything, but it is pretty interesting, and even sad. The gameplay basically works liike this:  There are two doors on either side of you, like the first game, which you can check. Before shining your flashlight down the left or right hall, you must listen for the sound of heavy breathing, which means an animatronic is right next to your door, in which case you must close it and wait for the sound of footsteps to signal them leaving. If your hear breathing and shine your light, the animatronic will kill you. The use of audio cues helps to advance the creepy, intimidating atmosphere of the game, which works well. However, the breathing is very faint, so I advise you turn up your volume to hear it. There's also a closet in front of you, which will not need to be checked for most of the night. That is until Foxy runs in while you're not looking and the door noticeably creaks shut a bit. From there, you must check on Foxy and shut the door on him, until you see a Foxy plushie on the floor when you open it again. If you see Foxy as an animatronic, do the same as you did before. And finally, you can look behind you to shine your light on a bed to scare off little Mini-Freddies that will often appear on the bed. Overall, while the breathing audio could be tweaked for a better gameplay experience, and the jumpscares do get old, Five Nights at Freddys 4 serves as a satisfying conclusion to a great franchise of mystery, terror, and tension.","July 24, 2015","true","3.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"

This game is the superior overlord of scary, after all, Scott wanted this final chapter to be the most scariest game out of all the series. One thing’s for sure, normally you play as a security guard, but FNAF 4 takes it to a whole new level when you play as a kid having nightmares—now, there IS going to be an update, but! Scott won’t open the box, and I believe that’s because almost everybody figured out all the mysteries, so Scott had nothing left to hide and decided to ditch the box, because from what I’ve heard, the box was supposed to be the key to all the mysteries and secrets, but apparently we already spoiled the secret.\nNow, some people think that Fredbear was the cause of the Bite Of ’87, but this takes place at Fredbear’s family diner in 1983, so says the Fredbear & Friends Easter Egg. We know that the Bite Of 87 was at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, the victim was Jeremy Friztwhatever, and it took place on a birthday at 1987. Though Foxy and Mangle are the most popular suspects, they were not active or on the stage during that day, like the other old animatronics, so it HAD to be one of the toy animatronics on the stage. Toy Bonnie’s mouth isn’t wide enough, nor is Toy Freddy’s, but what about Toy Chica? Although, her beak is off at night, at day, a beak like that with sharp teeth or not, it can bite of a frontal lobe no problem. You wouldn’t believe that I’ve said this, but Toy Chica was the cause of the Bite Of ’87! But wait! What if there was a twist? You know how there’s a small fan in every game? So…what if the fan was behind it all?! YEAH, probably not!\nAnd now, time for the case of the crying child! Most people think of him as the puppet, or is he Golden Freddy? Well, in one of the minigames, you see some brown hair sticking out of one of the suits—YES! The very first victim of the Purple Man is Golden Freddy HIMSELF! So does that STILL mean the crying child is the puppet? You could say.\nAnyway, I had lots of fun playing this game, there were some serious scares—BUY IT.

But, theres alot of things i have a problem with. THERE ARE NO CAMERAS! It cant be a freddys came without cameras, you cant explore around the map! Another thing is, there is no phone guy/phone call. The thing i will give Scott is the fear, its very scary! I also thought plushtrap was in the game not a minigame -_-. The bite of 87' was also a dissapointment all it is is just a kids brother killing his brother no ghost or anything involved. It was an accident also. The main game is, is basically  just looking into 2 identcial hallways all game. I still think its a good game and i would recommend it. Its the scariest! But im sure it will get old eventually. For a phone call scott could of just done a phone call of his mom or something like that. Cameras speak for itself. Theres no office either but i can get over that. Good news is atleast we got the squeaky freddy nose right!? It is cool that you can look behind you. Theres no balloon boy and puppet either. All in all even though it may not sound like it you should still buy this game its still scary and fun! Not that much eastereggs either and not alot going on. Who is nightmare? I like how someone is under your closet and under you bed. and when they pick you up! and once you turn on the light you might be dead. Also, the title screen is dumb as well. The breathing thing should be changed to something else. I am still enjoying  it but they should of put more  effot into it.

You did so great on this game series it breaks my heart to her the title of the game (which is Five Nights At Freddy's 4 The Final Chapter) and I remeber most of everyones reaction when the FIrst one came out and when I played it on my mobile device when bonnie popped up and scared the living daylight out if me I literally dropped my phone,  Then I found out you were making a 2nd game and I bought it the day it came out and the way you changed the game series it was mind blowing ive never seen any game developer do that I was mind blown. Then the 3rd one came and at this time this game became an internet sensation and i saw the trailer and literally said "Shut up and take my money" and played it and found all the secrets and my brain was spinning I was going on google to see for anything. I was doing everything to find out the backstory to this great game I never did find it but i do hope it gets solved in the 4th and final one (even tho I hope its not the end). Then today July 24th 2015 I was going through my subscribtions and I see "Markiplier ARE YOU BRAVE ENOUGH? / Five Nights At Freddy's 4 - Part 1" and he said its the demo and I was like dangit then his 2nd episode came out and he said "its out NOW" I then ran to my computer and checked steam and it said "Five Nights At Freddy's 4 8.00$" I asked for it right away and started to play it. I was talking to a friend while playing and shined my left to the right door and saw Bonnie run away and closed the game and told my friend "I cant do this" and he started to laugh he then had to talk to his mom. I started to play I made it on night 2 I was shaking then the closet moved I went to it  and Foxy jumpscared me I started to shake so bad it looked like I was picking up a fever I was shacking so bad I beat the night and needed to take a breather I came back upstairs and wrought this giangantic review. So this giant review is more like a giant thank you to Scott because without him scary games wouldnt be as fun as they are im not that big on scary games but this game is so fun that I dont care how much I get scared so thanks Scott so much and good luck on your next game I will take a look at your next game you do but no mater waht you will be in my book of best game creator.

But this, this is a whole new level. Amazing story that sticks with you, great animations, chilling atmosphere, and of course, the jumpscares. These jumpscares give little to no warning and can really surprise you. This game is very good at scaring with more than just jumpscares. but anticipation. Every time you turn on the flashlight you cringe. Everytime you look behind you and then turn around again, you want to momentarily turn down the volume. And just when you think you have a handle on the system, Scott throws a curveball to make you change how you play. Great game!

Night 3, and I'm more terrified than ever. Jumpscares, sure, but these are done so well that they do not deserve the crap jumpscares normally get. Gameplay is fantastic. Not having cameras is horrible and makes you feel isolated, which adds to the terror, and knowing Freddy is always right behind, "chargin his attack" is the worst. Running back and forth is also a great aspect, as it makes the gameplay more personal. Scott Cawthon, you outdid yourself.

Unlike in the other games, you can't really anticipate when the jumpscare is coming, so they stay fresh and get you every time! Althoug sometimes the jumpscare has to load and the screen goes black for a while, in which case you know EXACTLY what is about to happen... Whcih brings me onto my first complaint - loading times. Each night takes from 30 seconds to a full 5 minutes to load, aswell as in game animations, which take about 10 seconds to load at the start of a night. It may not seem like much, but whith the speed of the animatronics you need every second to put towards keeping them away... Whcih brings me onto my second issue: the game gets too hard too quickly. Night 1 and 2 were quite good, but then at night three you are thrown into a literal torrent of jumpscares. I am a very casual gamer and, as such, struggle trying to get past 1am in night 3! I think a difficulty setting should be incorporated (e.g. an easy, medium and hard) so people like me can finish the game. Finally, for some reason, the game won't fill my full screen, even when I press F11. This is only a minor issue. However, despite this, I will continue to try my best to complete it, even if I can't get past night 3, for the brilliant, smooth gameplay that is new to FNaF. I look forward to the DLC and can't wait to find out everything about the backstory! Overall, a very good game that meets up and exceeds standards that you may want to play if your computer is beefier than mine (which isn't too great...) and you can take the jumpscares! Edit: Well, Scott has fixed the full screen isuue! Now i just have to click 'continue' to see if it loads faster! Oh dear.... Ehem, no that that is a problem, having to play it or anything.... DEFINITELY not because it is so scary or anything, he he, erm..","July 24, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"

One day I was watching youtube when I get a text from a friend saying "FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S 4 IS SOOOO SCARY YOU MUST PLAY IT!" And I thought to myself that there's no way that this is as scary as silent hill right. I am the biggest idiot on the internet.\n\nI honestly thought that Scott was going to screw it up with FNAF 4 after not doing such an amazing job on FNAF 3, but by far this is the scariest game i've played in a long time. The animatronics are beyond terrifying and I like how Scott has added all this extra detail on freedy and all them that makes them truely scary. I have barely played the game and only on night 2 because i'm that freaked out, I got jumpscared on night 1 by bonnie at 2 am, how embarassing.\n\nAlso, the new gameplay mechanics are superb. In the first three games, you are a adult security guard who at least has the slightest bit of smarts and the most ineffecive security system in all of video game security systems. I never got why the doors in FNAF 1 required power to stay down, couldn't gravity do that job, then I guess it wouldn't be a challenge. But enough of my rambling, FNAF 4 completely strips you off all sense of self security and makes the player a small boy in his bedroom with nothing but a torch, and i've got to say that Scott really captured that feeling of all alone with monsters surrounding you and all you can do is suck your thumb and wait for Bonnie or Chica to kill you.\n\nHowever there was one downside, The game does it's job too well. I get so scared in the atomsphere and the feel of the dark bedroom that if I hear even the slightest noise I immediately shut the game down because i'm actually afraid. Maybe I should stop playing the game at night with the lights off and my headphones on.\n\nStill, absolutely fantastic game. You've created a masterpiece and a legacy Scott and for that you deserve all the praise the series gets. I would put this up top with some of my favourite games. This game is like a shining diamond in what I call `the bleak industry of expensive games that don't live up' I'm looking at you COD Ghosts. I also find it really odd that most indie game developers can make better games than what a million dollar games company can't do with their endless pockets of gold encrusted rubies.\n\nAbsolute must play for any fan of horror games.\nOVER 9000/10","August 10, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

This is easily in the top 2 of my favourite FNAF games. Still to be completed, but night 5 isn't a walk in the park right now!\n\nThe only thing I'm not enjoying about this game so far is that there's two extremes to the volumes: On the one hand you're raising your awareness for this supposed 'breathing' noise I can't seem to make out, and on the other, said risen awareness plus extremely loud jumpscare equals  a really bad headache.\n\nAs the game stands right now, it's pretty awesome, I'm impressed with this one, and is well on the way to being the best in the series - the graphics are awesome, the concept is awesome, everything about the look and feel of the game so far is awesome, but the flashlight sticks sometimes which sucks, and I'm not willing to risk my hearing just so I can deficate myself. If the other aspects of the game are good enough, you don't need loud noises to scare people - If you want that, I suggest any horror story mod on Garry's Mod.","July 23, 2015","true","18.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

Again, scared the balls out of me.\n\nFor now, that is about all I can say! I rate the game 9.9/10, only because of the very, VERY minor issues that I experienced personally.\n\nThank you for another GREAT experience.\n\n~takeo9","July 23, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I died several times because I couldn't tell whether or not the anamotronic was there. I closed the door and Bonnie still killed me.\n\nPlease fix this, I know the game was just released today and it's going to be a little buggy but please fix these errors for us to have a better experience.

However, I know Scott said he would fix the fullscreen issue "before the day is over." I understand we all live in different time zones so it will probably be fixed before I wake up tommorow. Another issue has arised though. The "breathing" is inaudiable for many of us. For people like Razz or Dawko Or Mark, along with a handful of non-youtubers, it worked just fine. For the rest of us though, this is not the case. I hope you fix this Scott as this is one of your best games yet.","July 23, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm doing good." And then Bonnie apears. This is acctually the first FNaF game in a year that got me scared. FNaF 1 did but not anymore. After Bonnie, I closed out of the game, instantly. You play as a kid, trying to survive till his party. And you have anamatronics in your house for some reason. Just play the game...\n\nI am going back to edit this now and saying, this is now the only FNaF game that acctually had me on the edge of seat while playing and shamefully admiting, minor crying of fear (One or two tears). I ending up screaming "HOLY ----!" at 1:22 AM. You did it Mr. Cawthon, you finally broke me. This is now the only game I refuse to play out of fear. I'll try to pick it up again later but untill then I'm leaving all the playing to my friends.","July 23, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"
