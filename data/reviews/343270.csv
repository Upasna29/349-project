I really do. But this is a walking simulator and a bad one at that.\nThe controls go a long way towards that conclusion. With WASD unavailable for movement, you're forced to use the arrow keys to navigate and the mouse to turn which wouldn't be a major problem if you didn't also have to use E and Q. Do me a favour, pop one hand on your arrow keys then one on your mouse. Now try and reach either E or Q. What's even worse is that Q is sprint, rendering it effectively useless unless you can jog on the spot. Which you can't.\nThe plot is a mess, the characters are irritating and the multiplayer is one of the most baffling looking things you will lay eyes upon in some time. Maybe the only decent thing I can say about it is that for £0.79, you can experience the unintentional hilarity of the Hat Mannequin Death House, where limbless wooden horrors bob for apples, kick trash bags around and throw hammers at you with their mouths.\nOr I guess you could just watch me do it.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTlTNkQ5TCs\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCdGt1cYxcs","August 27, 2015","false","5.1"," 60 of 71 people (85%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","85","60","71","13","3"

Exactly 19 minutes. That's for 100%. It's one of the ugliest looking things I've ever played. The plot is non-sensical & it has a M. Night style twist at the end (not a Others or Village one... but like a Happening one). It's basically "mannequins move on their own simulator 2014". Just look at the screenshots. That will tell you what to expect. This is pretty much the new "Bad Rats" or "Secret of the Magical Crystals" on Steam.

Disillusions Manga Horror is a game that can be finished in less than an hour more or less. I bet if you tried you could maybe even finish it in half an hour. The graphics are ugly as sin and all of the scares are more or less the same tired jumpscare repeated over and over. The story is complete ♥♥♥♥ too, with the twists and turns being especially bad.\n\nSo yeah, this game is as bad as it looks from the screens. The only saving grace? It's occasionally funny for all the wrong reasons and... it works?

This isn't really a horror game, this is more of a walking simulator, because nothing really kills you (Except water).\n\nIf you are scared of loud noises every 10 seconds, and shadows that pop out of nowhere, yet are perfectly harmless, I guess this is right up your alley.\n\nThe controls are terrible, you move at a snail's pace, the mouse doesn't disappear until you click something, and you've got this short little "sprint" that lasts less than a second if you press Q. You need to press it each 2 seconds or so, and it's quite annoying, because it gives you think that you are going faster. (You are, but it's still painfully slow).\n\nThe music is meh, the ambient sounds are half creepy, yet they get old rather fast. The voice "acting" is ATROCIOUS and gets old in less than a minute. It's the same stuff in japanese over and over and over. The first character sound like it was voices with microsoft Sam or something like that.\n\nThe art style is unremarkable, it's just ♥♥♥♥ing manga, and it isn't even that good.\n\nGraphics? Typical unpolished low quality unity graphics with endless pitch black darkness in front of you.\n\nArt? Meh.\n\nSound? Terrible.\n\nControls? ♥♥♥♥ing terrible.\n\nPlot? As I said, it's a walking simulator, but even still, the plot doesn't even make any sense. It's not even cliche, it's just something that a 10 year old could come up with.\n\nPros? Well, there are cards, if you are into that. And it's short, so your torture is nice, short and sweet.\n\nOh, and there's multiplayer, but I don't know if it's broken or not. Good luck finding somebody to play this game with. I got it as a gift and I feel insulted, because I think I killed a few of my brain cells.\n\n\n\n","October 24, 2015","false","2.8"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","3"

I must have some masochism disorder. Hmm.\n\nOk, what is wrong with this one?\nDoes the cheap price can excuse everything?\nDoes a game made by "one man in his attic and his girlfriend in their spare time" should explain the result here?\nI say no. SORRY, NO. These are not excuses goddammit.\n\n-Level design is bad, it is way too harsh: it looks like someone cut pieces of planes, polygons & models with an axe before assembling them. They are too empty too.\n-Textures are horrible. Seriously, that's not the first time there is this problem in this kind of games! STOP using this much bump mapping!! STOP, THIS IS REALLY DISGUSTING!!! Also, not enough/not any specular on various textures. They don't look natural and are too dark.\n-Cheap jumpscares everywhere with moving shadows and mannequins. How original. How unscary.\n-Too much forced camera movements. You can do this sometimes to make the player see something that happens but don't abuse of it, here this is too much.\n-Multiplayer mode is not really funny to play at all so it's disappointing.\n-Google translated game. I tried French, saw the massacre, instantly switched to English. If you want someone to update/correct this for free PM me dev.\n\nOn the other hand,\n\n-Story was not super innovative... at least there was an attempt, ok. End was predictable and a little cliché but that was not a problem for me. Too short though.\n-Anime character sprites are not so bad but they could use more details (like at least some shadows).\n-The jumpscares were too cheap and repetitive like I said BESIDES two events that were actually not too bad, I'm talking about the walls that disolve at the end of chapter 2, reminded me of Silent Hill 3, plus the final event of chapter 3, with the books flying around and so on.\n-Text describing various things, events... maybe a little too much but I liked the idea.\n\nI can't really recommend this game, even at this low price. This should be free.\nThis project lacks of details and attention, especially those pretty crappy textures. I'm sorry but NO, this is a REAL problem that happens too often. It is not hard to make nice looking textures damn, or at least ones which have the right amount of bump, spec, illumination, etc..\n\nTL;DR: even with a huge discount I can't recommend it. Principles. It is not polished, jumpscares are too cheap. I don't wanna seem mean but it really, really needs to be improved a lot, there are too many failures.","August 11, 2015","false","5.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","2"

Why?  It was freaking fun to play!\n\nKeep in mind, this game was ported from IOS.  No, that doesn't give it too much right to be bad but hey, it's somethin...\n\nIf you go into this game expecting a horror game you're gonna feel like your half hour would have been better spent breathing dorito dust and spraying RAID into your eyeballs, but if you look at this game from a satirical standpoint... it's a freaking hilarious, fun game and it doesn't take too long to play so you should play it.\n\nBasic Short Review\nArtwork -- Looks like it was drawn in Paint but better than I could do\nStory -- Cliche and the finer details didn't make much sense (why would DiS so easily believe that was his house eh?)\nMusic -- Really good actually\nGraphics -- spoopy mamequinz\nDev -- cool guy, didn't trash my video hatin' on the game\nGameplay -- bad but I've seen much worse in bigger titles\nPrice -- 69 cents ain't bad and I got it for 51 on sale\n\nWorth getting?  It costs less than a soda for half an hour of spoopy fun.  Sure, get it (just don't expect to be scared)\n\nLonger Review\nArtwork -- artist draws humans better than I do (I can only draw dragons and apples)\nCouldn't tell if DiS was a guy or a girl\nCops don't usually show that much cleebage\nFull range of 2d manga expressions\nArtwork hosted on deviantart\nStory -- Fanfiction quality.  Made me wonder if this actually was a fanfiction for a moment.\nShallow characters\nWe never get to see Vigil :C\nMost of the plot doesn't make real sense\nMusic -- Loud but good\nwhoever did it has talent\nfits the mood quite well\nworth downloading from a seedy torrent site\nGraphics -- Iphone quality (that's where it came from)\nReuses the same mannequins.  Made it difficult to rememer which mannequin was which.\nTextures are sub-par (POLICE was written backwards on the cop car)\nBlack shadow was a transluecent mannequin and obviously not a crab\nDev -- cool guy\nnot a 15 year old girl\nmade a nice comment on my video (which was oddly surprising actually and I feel honored now)\nhas a girlfriend\nGameplay -- spoopy walking simulator\nCharacter sprints for 2 seconds because they require an oxygen tank to breathe\nNo clicking at all, you walk into the "?  ?  ?"s.  My right hand felt sad :C\n3 chapters, each one more chapter-y than the next\nEach jump scare made me laugh harder\nActually has a pretty sweet concept for multiplayer, if anyone would play it (could be a fun party game and heck it only costs you 69 cents to gift it to someone)\nPrice -- It was fiddy cents\n\nSo after reading my review you may be thinking "gat dang dis gam soundz terribel" but actually all of those cons listed earlier were pros all along!  Each and every reason listed above screams "this game is hilarious."\n\nPlus, it has trading cards.\n\nEnd Review -- If you have half an hour to waste pick this game up, it's hilarious\nComplimentary video of me playing the game\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c-_IQenPcw","December 4, 2015","true","1.3"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","69","18","26","7","4"

In Disillusions we play as two characters, Dis and Sui. Dis visits an island that was once ravaged by a serial killer and Sui is there to check it out. I can't understand what the hell this game is even about. The dialogue is hilariously bad and the voice acting made me laugh out loud. Putting the story aside the gameplay is garbage, it's just walking around running into question marks to read about the story more. The game only has 3 chapters and chapter 4 is multiplayer mode which of course no one plays. The graphics are nothing too special and since the developer admitted that i'm not gonna judge the graphics. Overall there's not a lot to say about Disillusions Manga Horror, this game is mediocre at best and i for the price i really can't recommend it unless you get it in a bundle or at a discount you can safely check it out. If you're looking for a dose of good horror go somewhere else.

Decisions need to be made here: was this an intentionally  or unintentionally bad game? I am leaning in the intentionally bad direction with this one. It's essentially a walking simulator with ridiculous attempts at jump scares (creepy mannequins moving around, random camera jumps to basically mundane items like a piano or a bookshelf, shadowy creatures, and so on). The story itself was 100% predictable, lol. The graphics themselves are fairly typical of Unity engine games. Nothing of note good or bad.\nYou dont actually click on anything. Events are unlocked mostly by question marks that you walk into., which then trigger whatever may or may not happen next lol. The dialogue is obviously ridiculous.\nThe music however was pretty cool such as it is.\n\nAlso, there are trading cards, and at the time of this review, they are shockingly selling for 20+ cents a piece.\n\nhmmm...do I rate this as a positive or a negative.\n\nI'm going with a real rating of 2 out of 10, but an intentionally bad rating of 6.5 out of 10.

For example: the hammer flew at me when I wasn't in front of the window, but to the side of it. Because I couldn't see the hammer, I wasn't startled at all.\nEven though the story is very short, the jumpscares were fairly repetitive. For example: the mannequins move. All of them! After the first two I got the drill and they didn't startle me at all after that.\n...I do have to admit I played this game during the day and without headphones, because I scare very easily. (But that doesn't mean none of the jumpscares got me! It's just, as soon as I was able to predict them, they didn't scare me anymore.)\n\nThe voice acting would've been a nice touch, if the acting wasn't so bad. "Ah. It's a ghost." --> that didn't sound like the character was scared at all. It sounds like someone's just speaking the words from the page, without visualising an actual scary scene. (Were the voice actors chosen simply because they could speak Japanese? I'm not sure if this game was originally Japanese or not, but I'm guessing it wasn't.) Anyway, voice acting is nice and all, but without professional actors it just deducts from the whole experience.\nIn this case I'd say: maybe give the player the option to turn the voices off. Cause every time they started talking (out loud, I mean) the creepy atmosphere disappeared.\n\nAfter having started the third chapter I wondered why the first two chapters weren't added together to make one chapter. That's because there is suddenly a different main character for the last chapter. I mean, I understand that there's three chapters because of the three locations, but I still think it would've been better to have two chapters with two different protagonists. What do you think?\n\nI really didn't expect the twist at the end of the second chapter, because I was thinking we'd be following DiS for the duration of the three chapters and it's the kind of twist you'd expect at the end of all things.\nThe twist at the end of the third chapter, on the other hand, was not unexpected AT ALL. The story kept hinting at Sui's mental disorder in a not-so-subtle way - like when she looks at the café and goes like "those people deserved it, teehee" - kind of like the mannequins I was talking about earlier (in the second spoiler).\n\nThe anime art style was quite nice, I really liked it!\nI just didn't understand Sui's alternate costume: it's not in the game proper, only in the options menu, but just its being there tells the player a lot about Sui. For me, it spoiled the twist that, gasp, omg, Sui was the murderer! There's gotta be something wrong with anyone who dresses like that. ;)\nI'm not sure about the virtual environment, uh, like, I mean the backgrounds and mannequins and stuff: it didn't look very special to me, just another Unity horror game, I guess.\n\nI didn't make use of the VR support, because I don't have an Oculus Rift. (VR horror games just creep me out way too much!)\n\nI'm giving the review a thumbs up because I intend to play it again sometime. It's short enough for that. Maybe I'll try to beat the high score.\n\n---\n\nAll in all I didn't think it was a bad game per se, but I do think it would've been better if this game were free.\nI'm not trying to rob you of your income here, but it seems like this game was more of an experiment than a full-fledged, actual, finished game. There were too many clichés (storywise) and not enough actual horror/jumpscares (see mannequins and hammer mentioned earlier).\nI don't think you deserve the tone in which some people have reviewed this game, I really don't. But that's not to say I disagree with some of the points they've made.\n\nHope this helps! Good luck on your next project!","January 20, 2015","true","0.6"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","7"

Seems though that there are quite a few jumpscares that aren't necessary in the game to make it enjoyable. The atmosphere is enough to make you feel a little uncomfortable, but not quite there in terms of "Horror" It's making progress otherwise building up to that. When it comes to the title of the game, "Manga horror" isn't even needed. The developer has mentioned a few cool things in the upcoming updates such as Multiplayer and i'm actually looking forward to that!\n\n\nIt's priced cheap, but even so, Disillusions Manga Horror is still a game that should be purchased and played.","January 30, 2015","true","2.7"," 20 of 38 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","20","38","2","0"

The jumpscares were pretty well done becasue they were just small little things every once in awhile and they honestly got me, reason one: mannicans scare me half to death and reason two: sounds scare me (especially if they are sudden and loud). I would like an update of the game that incorperates more chapters and going into more detail about who Sui is and who Dis and Virgil is. Other than that I throughly enjoyed this game.","September 3, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

While not an enjoyable game, it certainly has the atmosphere down pat!\nI dunno, maybe I am just the type to be easily scared?\n\nAll the while I was playing this, I couldn't tell if I was in immenent danger for making the wrong decisions (like Slenderman, for example) or if the game was a haunted house experience. The fact that it wasn't clear was annoying, but at the same time, not knowing just added to the tension.\n\nThe voice acting is a little too loud and lacks any emotion at all, relating to the character portraits. If I were to change something about the game, it would probably be just the voice acting, which would be better if it was at least recorded with a better microphone.\n\n.Music - A little repetitive. Definitely spooky - 7/10\n.Sounds - Convincing, scary and well timed - 10/10\n.Art - Somewhat limited character portraits. Decent character art style. 3d art is pretty standard for a home made Unity game. Well furnished environments. - 9/10\n.Story and Progression - Unconvincing and repetitive. Doesn't seem to be the focal point. - 5/10 (taking into consideration that it isn't focal)\n.Voice acting - Terrible. Down right terrible. All lines in the game are voiced, but it is way too loud and emotionless. The recording quality is terrible. - 2/10 (points for fully voiced)\n\nI didn't get to experience the Occulus Rift features because I don't own the hardware. No doubt I would have ♥♥♥♥ myself if I had tried playing like that.\n\nReveiw as of completing the first chapter only. 14/15 events triggered. (I mised the tree on the other side of the wall).\nI give the first chapter a 7/10 for overall experience. (not quite the same as the average of the other scores).\n\nNot a remarkable game, but the price you pay for it won't leave a sting in your pocket. You'd buy a candy bar for as much, and enjoy it for just as long.","October 5, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","7"

She also killed them because they were disobedient and annoying wow teacher of the year. Also Dis leaves purgatory to go visit the place his friends died believing he killed them to mourn for them? Also if she was a teacher how did she become a police officer, get a police cruiser, go to the island after someone who broke into the police scene and know that it was Dis (who she dosent even mention his name just calls him "the boy I framed for my murderous spree". How does that make any sense? Also if she is some kind of demon why couldnt she open the big oak door? How did Dis escape purgatory? What actually happened? There are so many holes in plot that werent filled, that were inconsistent or didnt make sense.\n- There are very few different jumpscares mannequins, gourney, shadows, random noises and moving objects.\n- Also it was only partially voiced and the voicing was only in japenese.\n- 2 second sprint is killing me it only last 2 SECONDS and the character is so slow.\n- You cant get three stars in the game only two, whats the point in having three stars if you can only earn two of them?\n\n\nI have to admit I did like the pier thing where the pier was falling apart and you had to run while it was falling behind you. But overall the game was stupid and was just thrown together, also why would a demon need to make bombs in order to blow up part of an island and murder a bunch of school kids? none of the plot makes sense and why was there a bomb making thing in Dis's house in purgatory if he wasnt even the murderer in the first place? seriously none of the plot makes sense. I would rate 3/10.","January 19","true","0.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","2"

To me, it's simple but enjoyable enough. You get a lot (an upcoming multiplayer option, trading cards, etc.) considering the low price. And although the game is terribly short, it produced a few good jumpscares and includes a decent little twist at the end. The anime-style art and the backgrounds weren't exactly refined, but they were effective. I also appreciated the effort put into including voiceovers, which was a nice touch. I just wish the voice actors were a little more expressive because it would help add to the overall experience. My biggest complaint, really, is the length of the game itself. It would be great if they could include more chapters in the future, or perhaps even implement some kind of mod capability via the workshop to expand the story and game a bit more. Basically, you are getting what you pay for, and I was not disappointed.","January 24, 2015","true","1.2"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

The game manages to have some pretty good atmosphere and the Manequins can surprise and scare you at times. The game is also pretty short with 3 chapters that took me about 25 mins (ish).\nI also had some technical problems (I think) as my character kept slowly walking backwards for some reason.\n\nNow, I noticed that the game let you choose the language at the start, and so I decided to play it in German. The walking-backwards problem seemed to be gone, but the translation was terrible. Like, Google-translate level terrible. Why not just ask some community people to help translate it, instead of using some crappy computer-generated translation?\n\nAlthough I realize that making a game is not easy and the game is pretty cheap, I would not recommend this game to anyone I know.

The only redeeming feature about this game is that, for the price and access to trading cards, you can feasibly idle and get a profit off of it.\n\nGameplay usually consists of navigating poorly lit areas in simple Point A to B fashion, and the run function is bugged to the point that you will tediously walk at all times. Jump scares are weak and at times usually indistinguishable aside from the obvious audio cues. There is no threat of death.\n\nAudio and visual resources are nothing special at all. The art assets are cheap and mediocre and characters are poorly drawn. Scare cues are stock, and they even use a text-to-voice tool for the odd voice clip.\n\nThe plot is stupid, the writing treats you like an idiot, it all feels as if it should be tongue-in-cheek.

It is increcibly short too (maybe a good thing), and virtually no replay value.  The voice acting was read so so little emotion to match the text that I actually found it more interesting.
