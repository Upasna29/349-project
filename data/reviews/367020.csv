Developed by Unwonted Studios and published by Unwonted Studios, Sekai Project and can be found on MangaGamer store.\n\nThe Story At first glance  looks like your normal typical romance visual novel  but, I was so wrong about this when you get into the game you will be met with the “common route” which is quite standard and can be found in many romance visual novel. But once you get into the routes, lets take Megumi for example once going into her route there was an gloomy atmosphere and all around which I really loved.\n\nUpon returning, Hideaki re-discovers a town he knew from childhood, meeting new friends and reuniting with those he had long forgotten. He resumes his high school life in the big city, quickly adapting to the change in pace, and before he knows it, Hideaki begins to think of this city as his home once more.\n\nHideaki’s life in Okutama is upbeat and fun, thanks to the many friends he makes, including Megumi, an energetic student council member; Chinatsu, a reserved senior in the literature club; Shiro, an unsociable music-lover; and Yui, an obstinate girl who rarely expresses herself honestly.\n\nSurrounded by an interesting group of friends, Hideaki lives out his days without a care in the world, content to enjoy a normal high school life. Whether he’s going out with friends or studying for exams, his new life is truly peaceful.\n\nAs Hideaki’s stay in Okutama continues, ghosts from his past begin to come back, increasingly intruding on the new life he’s trying to build. As if that wasn’t bad enough, his new friends all have secrets of their own, and the more Hideaki involves himself with their daily lives, the deeper into mutual despair he sinks.\n\nWill you be able to put to rest the evils of the past and finally live out the normal high school life you crave? Will you be able to put your friends’ minds at ease, erasing the trauma and misery ruining their otherwise peaceful lives?\n\nAudio and Visual elements Background, CGs  art – They are generally good I liked the soft colors being used in the backgrounds as it completely compliments together with other visual factors that can be found in the game like Character sprites and CGs. As for the CGs of this game are very pleasant to look at and the art style is very “charming” with the use of bright colors to depict the mood and environment.\n\nAudio Elements – The music sets the mood for every situation, depicting playfulness, happiness, agony and many more. Overall the music in game is above average and it has 35 music tracks which could be found in the “Extras” area. Among all I loved this track in particular “Don’t Forget” which lasts 5:38 minutes. [This is personal preference mainly because its a piano song and I do like songs like these]\n\nTo sum up I would recommend this Visual Novel if you do like romance, school and obviously Visual Novels themselves. I honestly did not expect it to be so well written where you get too see character development and plot changes here and there. On the surface No One But You looks like a standard romance Visual Novel but I was really surprised by this Visual Novel. Overall I could say I do not recommend on missing out on this title.\n\nClick here for the full review![azusantiara.com]\n\nEdit - grammar mistakes","January 19","true","17.1"," 117 of 155 people (75%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","75","117","155","12","9"

I played through Megumi's route and, up until the point where she became my girlfriend, everything was fine. A little bland, perhaps, but enjoyable. Then a new teacher showed up at the school, raising about fifty pedophile flags as he did so. He starts to torment Megumi behind the scenes, until you film him arguing with her and threaten to upload it online. Then Megumi tells you her tragic backstory: a year ago, the same teacher started teaching at the school, tormented her sister for a while, then tried to r*pe her. Megumi saw this as it was happening and tried to stop him, causing him to "accidentally" violently murder her sister. Then he got caught. But, one year later, he's somehow out of prison, and teaching in the same school where he committed r*pe and murder. The only explanation given for this is one line in which he says how "expensive" it was to avoid prison.\n\nAfter sharing her backstory, Megumi becomes more confident in standing up to him, and it seems like life is back to normal again. As a result, she and the main protagonist both show a remarkable lack of concern about their pedophile/r*pist/murderer teacher. Surprisingly, this turns out to be a bad idea, as he then goes to her house at night, presumably to r*pe and murder her. She sends you a panicked voicemail, you run to her house rather than contacting the police or asking your mother to drive you there, and then it turns out she killed him.\n\nSO, TO SUMMARISE: a pedophile/r*pist/murderer is caught pedo-ing/r*ping/murdering, avoids prison, returns to teach at the school where he pedo-ed/r*ped/murdered, pedo-es for a few weeks, you stand up to him, stop caring that he is a pedophile/r*pist/murderer, he goes to your girlfriends house, presumably to pedo/r*pe/murder, then she murders him.\n\n\nAfter that, you can tell her to turn herself in or run away with you. I picked the first option, which led to her having sex with me, and then turning herself in. I'm assuming that the sex would've happened regardless of my choice. There was no sex scene; apparantly there will be a patch for that soon.\n\n\nAfter seeing pedophilia/r*pe/murder being executed so poorly in this route (why the ♥♥♥♥ isn't he in prison; you can't pay your way out of r*pe/murder charges, let alone be re-employed by the school where you did the r*ping/murdering) I am forced to assume that the writing for the others is equally poor, so I don't intend to play through them. Kinda feels like I've wasted my money.\n\nTL;DR: Kinda bland, until a r*pist/murderer who was caught in your school a year ago, and inexplicably avoided prison, returned to teach at the same school one year later and, despite knowing this, you and the sister of the girl who was murdered show a remarkable lack of concern. AND THAT'S JUST ONE ROUTE.\n\n\nAlso, why does steam censor the word "r*pe"? It took a good few minutes for me to add all those asterisks in, time which could've been spent ranting to myself about the poorly executed ♥♥♥♥.","February 17","false","4.3"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","22","31","2","0"

I didn’t expected much to be honest (unfortunately there are a lot of VNs that have such a beautiful design, but the story/characters are bad… So I’m used to be disappointed at this point), but honestly… It was way better than I thought. The art style is truly beautiful, BGs and BGM were also amazing. And the story that is apparently a simple/cliche one, is saved by the characters. I really enjoyed them, every single one! Megumi was my favorite girl. And I did not expected that kind of ending… Wow. o_o\n\nAlso the “Ryo’s route” caught me off guard.

I do not think that the game is bad, and I can see a lot of potential. However, as it is, it feels extremely unfinished, and I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nThe stories themselves are enjoyable, and there are a significant amount of choices on the common route, but once it goes into each of the character's specific storylines, the choices disappear and you're left just reading through with a maximum of three choices throughout.  The base of the story is really interesting, and some of the routes definitely surprised me. Shiro and Megumi's did manage to tug at my heartstrings. I also really enjoyed the music, and I didn't mind the fact there were no voices. My major complaint is that they all end abruptly, with the exception of Megumi. As of now, there are no after stories besides Megumi, and I do not keep up with development updates to know if they will be coming soon.\n\nI would have liked to see more artwork. More CG Scenes, or even just a little more variety in the normal character images used through the stories. At one point, you take Shiro on a date and she was still wearing the school uniform. It's small details like that that take away from the impact of the game, and I just think there is so much more that could be done.\n\nThat said, I did enjoy the game and the different routes. It's by no means a BAD game, just feels like it is lacking a certain something. I haven't played enough Visual Novels to really know what.\n\nIf you buy this, enjoy it!

But it has so many problems that I just can't recommend it. There's a lot of ideas in here that could have been great, but all the plotholes and inconsistencies really weigh it down. This VN also tries way too hard to be very emotional and tug on your heartstrings, but it doesn't work with poor pacing and one-dimensional characters. NOBY takes a lot of inspiration from common Japanese VNs, but fails to understand what makes those elements from that medium work well.\n\nBecause of that, I'd rather recommend you read a JVN instead, such as "Yume Miru Kusuri" if you want dark themes plus romance done right, or "If My Heart Had Wings" if you want high school romance done right. Anything but this. Don't get me wrong, there are a few parts in this VN I think are pretty cool, but as a collective whole it's pretty bad.\n\n2/10\n\nRead my full, in-depth review here: https://kupowrites.wordpress.com/2016/02/15/no-one-but-you-review/","February 14","false","6.2"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","0"

I finished all available routes until now a day prior to writing this review.\n\nI think we can all agree that the West is far from producing Visual Novels with the level of professionalism we know and love from our Japanese counterparts. That being said, "No One But You" has this typically Western amateurish VN feeling to it, but I wouldn't hold it against Unwonted Studios. They managed to show more care and spend more time towards creating a truly entertaining VN in its own rights different then infamous Winged Clouds. The sad part is that Unwonted promised to polish their game up, admitting it felt rough around the edges -- but isn't showing any signs of doing so.\n\nIf anything, I have to say that I was impressed by what Unwonted managed to create here. Personally, I plan on replaying some routes once the patch comes out, that's how much I liked the experience. But on the other hand, this patch seems to be one of those hollow promises... a shame, the game itself really deserved more attention from the developers.\n\nWe have a Visual Novel with 5 different routes with different endings, a good art direction, nice writing, good taste in never exaggerating too much, but not keeping things mundane either, shocking (final) moments and excellent humor. In fact, the good humor of MC Hideaki is the trademark of this VN, and like in any good VN, his interaction with the other characters is what really kept me hooked until the very end. Unwonted managed to create characters for which you end up genuinely caring and wanting to know more about, be it about mysterious bookworm Chinatsu, genki class rep Megumi, shy and musically talented Shiro, hardboiled tsundere Yui, or self-declared "bestest friend in the whole wide world" Ryo.\n\nI felt that in some routes the other characters may have been neglected a bit too much, to the point of almost being non-existent and only remaining as some sort of memory. I'd like to point out specially Megumi during Shiro's route... her arc seems to have just been left hanging unresolved.\n\nAway from the amateurish stuff -- side characters suddenly having western names like Anna, artwork flashing out of nowhere for a second (whole scenes before they should appear), the calendar being unable to switch properly to the name of the next month (instead declaring that the month was repeating itself), gaining the achievement of two different endings when I finished only one, a character talking about a detail from a scene I didn't pick, and being unable to delete my save data ingame -- I'd say for Western VN readers to definitely give "No One But You" a shot. It may deserve some more polish, but it IS a fun experience guaranteed to get at least a chuckle out of you and make you feel for the characters.\n\nNow, if only the promised patch came out already... don't get your hopes up, though.","April 30","true","11.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

I would've liked to at least see how Hideaki is interacting with the other characters instead of them being put on a bus. Maybe have a little more of Hideaki's narration if he actually has been pushing the others away. The story will feel a little more fulfilling that way.\n-Sometimes I feel the route ends too quickly, and the closure after each route's climax is a little rushed. I've been whammed by the events and while I'm still reeling suddenly it's all over.\n\nYes, the plotlines are technically complete, but they leave something to be desired. I hear there was a patch but the last we've hard from the devs is all the way back at the end of March. I'm not getting my hopes up.\n\nThis is an okay visual novel, just not the best I've read. If you want this, get it at anywhere lower than its full price.","May 25","false","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are multiple characters you can choose to develop a romantic relationship with, (5 total) and the price is appropriate for the length of gameplay (about 10 hours). There are multiple endings for most characters, and some of the bad endings are pretty dark. Although there isn't as many oppotunities for choices as I would hope for, it is still just enough to make it still feel like a dating sim as opposed to just a visual novel.

The art and GUI are very pretty, especially the BGs which are just gorgeous tbh. The music isn't bad either.\n\nBut the characters are one-dimensional. I played through Ryo's route and while his relationship with the protagonist was very sweet and touching, the "conflict" of his story-line was poorly delivered. It used a lot of telling, rather than showing. It didn't make sense from a logical standpoint either. My impression is that the writer was attempting to write something beyond their ability to write, resulting in nonsense that failed to deliver the complexity its subject would suggest. I assume this is the case with the other routes, too.\n\nIt's a shame that this game has such disappointing writing; it's one of the few English-language visual novels that offers an LGBT route.","April 15","false","3.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I prefer to play the novel once and stick with the route that my choises brought me (I usually can't stand the protagonist be with any other heroine then the one I got first) and yes that's how I am, deal with it... back to topic... um okay so I was very confused after my first playtrough.. uhh I finished the Chinatsu route first because I didn't want to be a ♥♥♥♥ and ignore her so I talked with her on the bridge and somehow ended up with her.. or so it should have been, but apparently she was a ghost and dissapeard in the end (good ending?) yes sadly yes, that was the good ending, umm wtf? i thought to myself where did i mess up? but no i didnt mess up, well i did technically because i accidenly went the route i liked the least. Okay so I decided to break my rule with only one playtrough and go for one more try, note this, i wanted to go with the shiro route from the begining and i thought for sure that i would end up with her. Anyway so I decided to totaly ignore that ghost ♥♥♥♥♥ and do everything in my power to end up with the shiro route. And yes it worked, after the hot spring visit with class, during summer break, you start talking more with shiro who apparently is your neighbor, and after sometime the protagonist ask her out. Now this is where it gets annoying, the protagonist decides it would be a great idea to ask for love advice from his other friends, including the girl Megumi who obviously has a cruch on him, and i feel really bad for her because i like her character and question myself if i shouldent have gone with her route instead  because nothing interessting is happening right now. Anyway back to the route, so yeah during the date with Shiro out of nowhere Megumi appears and everything becomes really akward. I can't write everything in detail but i would say the date was kinda spoiled. then they jump like 30 days and the break is over. the protagonist and Shiro is very close now, but not yet a offical couple, and therefor during break, Megumi mans up and decides to confess to the protagonist. During the confession Shiro shows up and runs away, giving no time for the protagonist to explain, and he say some very mean things to Megumi :'( aaaaanyway shiro and megumi disspear from school and the protagonist try to contact shiro many times but no answer. rumors is going around, some japaneese gangsters show up in town asking around for shiros familys whereabouts and our protagonist decides he had enough of this ♥♥♥♥. he starts screaming outside her window until she finally shows her face. they have a pretty long and serious talk and the protagonist confess his obvious feelings for her saying shes the only one, and that he had turned down megumi. oh wait i forgot something, before this deep ♥♥♥♥,  our protagonist and his best bud Ryo went to the docks because they wanted to say hello the the japanese mafia, they get both knocked down and wakes up inside a old warehouse and is greeted by a man and two women on each of his side. he says he'll release him if he kills his friend. they give him a knife but when hes about to cut ryos throat he cuts the ropes instead and they run in sonic speed away from there. and now we're back to the present. okay so after this adventures day the protagonist goes to school like normal and they have class just like normal teenagers have. during break the tries to contact shiro with his phone but dsent get any respond. he of course worries and decides to skip school and hurry home and check on shiro. when he arrives the ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan (or so they say) two police cars are outside shiros house and a man who appears to be shiros dad is getting asked by the police. our protagonist explains everything for the plice but they dont take him seriously and you get the option to search for her alone n the docks. of course i did it and after some sneaking around you find shiro inside a cage, she's happy to see you but pleads that the protagonist saves himself and get out of there, now you get to decide if you want a bad ending or a bad ending. of course i dident know that both ofthem where bad so ipicked the most logically choise, to search for the keys duuh. so during the search you arrive at the room you and ryo was brough to before and there he is the boss himself, he explains shiros dad owe him a lot of money and therefor her father gave them her, to become a hooker, or a sex tool, something along those lines. he tells the protagonist that theyre taking her right now. so the protagonist runs out of the building towards the cage where shiro was being captive. but she of course had already been taken. you hear someone scream and run towards the sound. there she is, shiro, together with the two mafia girls from before. And this is where the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t hero acting begins, they have guns, of course, because they are, you know mafia. they tell the him to ♥♥♥♥ off, but instead hes like im invicible and starts walking towards them. and BAM hes shot, but continues to walk towards them, BAM BAM BAM BAMBAM BAMBAM BAM BAM BAM BAM and now he falls, but now the police arrives and the mafia gets arrested (or escapes you dont really see) now the last sceene, of course i cried because i wanted a good ending (THIS IS THE GOOD ENDING CMON DUDE) hes laying on her lap and its very dramatic, and so i understand that he will die, they exchange some very cliché lines like.... girl-i dont have any reason left to live boy-dont say that or else my death will have been in vain girl-you will not die, i wont allow it boy-you know very well that i wont make it girl- okay i will live for both of us, even if the world dies i will always remember you... something like that hehehe, anyway this route ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off (again it was very short and didnt enjoy this ending) so i started once again, this time MEGUMI. And ohboy this is even more weird. I mean by the appearance of the game (you know, all the hearts and the pink colours) you would think this game only contain pure hearted girls qute voice and big boobs, this is deafinely a wrong prediction. from my experience of anime, pink haired girls tend to be psycos (ehum hello mirai nikki). I'll keep this short, they become girlfriend-boyfriend, they spend littearly every minute together on summer break andwhen school starts the protognist longed for someone else to talk to. it is announched that a new homeroom teacher would start there the same day. the first few minutes he wins over more then half the girls in class with his ''charm''. it is explained later that he was the one who tried to ♥♥♥♥ megumis sister and in frustration he accidenly kills her, right infront of megumi. The teacher comes to her appartment during night but when he open the door he's met by a megumi holding a kitchen knife and she killed him. before all this she had sent a voice message to the protognist saying that ''he'' was outside her home. he runs as fast as his legs allow him to and arrives at the scene, but too late. you find megumi coverd in blood, holding a knife. she's saying something like, im a monster, im a murdurer just like him, and now i need to be punished as well. this is where you make the decision what to say, either ''Run away with me'' or ''You should turn yourself in'' i chose the latter and it gave me the good ending, she drops the knife and says that she'll take a shower, and that he should join her (she wants to have sex if this is the last time they'll have any freedom) and thats that. no just kidding, i was very scared because the end text came but i waited patiently and it paid off. After some months of prision she was declared innocent in the court. i was really happy with this route (probably my favourite one) mainly because of its lenght and because it was more interessting then the others so far. but i had came this far, so i might as well check out yuis route. and belive it or not, this is the only normal one.","February 25","true","14.3"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","10","19","5","3"

The general story kept me hooked on the game, and the backstories of the girls were also great. The game took thirteen hours for me to complete, so I think the price of the game was appropriate for its length. The girls themselves were also great, I especially liked Megumi and Chinatsu.\n\nWith all of these positive aspects of this game, you're probably wondering why I'm not recommending this game. Well, for whatever reason, the game only gives an afterstory for one of the five routes: Megumi's. The discussion board for this game had said that there would be afterstories for the other girls added to the game at some point, but this hasn't happened yet, and I'm starting to wonder if they will ever be added. But since I liked many aspects of this game, I will change my rating to "Recommended" if and when the other afterstories are added to the game.\n\nEdit: The game now has endings for Chinatsu and Shiro. I went ahead and changed my rating to "Recommended", however, there's still no afterstory for Yui or Ryo, so just beware.","March 15","true","15.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

That's the one word I have to decribe this one. I havent been this attached to a VN's Story in a while, and to me it's very close to being one of my all time favorites next to Katawa Shoujo(Not on Steam btw).\n\nThe really neat thing about the Story is how some of the character's back stories tie in with the Main Character. Nothing mind blowing, but very well written.\n\nThere are 5 routes total each with different endings. Which girl is my favorite? It's so hard to say! I felt attached to each character in the end(Except for Ryo, he's an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥)\n\nI do have to clear this out first. There were problems in the past with certain characters after stories. Apparently the Developers had some issues with the Artist(Who is really good by the way, the art style is fantastic). Originally there was supposed to be an 18+ version, which I'm guessing some scenes happen towards the end, but the Artist refused to draw those scenes. Not only that, but it took them a while to update the After Stories. A majority of them are complete now thankfully, except for Yui. Im not sure if they fixed that yet, I finished the game long ago.\n\nThere is supposed to be an 18+ update in the future(I think?) as well as Voice Acting and a DLC Character which is pretty cool. If you're expecting to get something sexy out of it, you're not going to get that yet, but I highly recommend it regardless(Cause I really didnt mind not having 18+ scenes). It's a beautiful story with memorable characters and a protagonist you'll appreciate, because he's a good guy.","May 18","true","18.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you are looking for something well-written instead of just some kind of idiotic soft-core hentai then this game is one you should definitely pick up. It's pretty lengthy too, it took me 3 hours to achieve one route.\n\nThe other routes took a much shorter time however since I skipped what I had already read. I completed three out of four of the routes and I know how the one I didn't do ends, honestly if you want my advice the only route that has an actually happy end is  Yui's  but  even that one has an ambiguous ending if you realize that you're basically leaving everyone you DIDN'T choose to die or be abused.\n\nFor spoilers on why I particularly can't recommend this game to those suffering with mental issues (Light spoilers, no specifics):\n\nThe first end I had gotten is the bad megumi end and I couldn't bring myself to play it any further after that point without taking an emergency happy-time break.\n\nMost endings are "bittersweet" at best.\n\nNot gonna lie though, Shiro was my favorite girl and BOTH HER ENDINGS WERE ♥♥♥♥.

I've gotten all the achivements, and all the routes.\n\nNo one but you, is a visual novel - dating simulator, is a tad bit wrong, as it's about love but there's not much requirement to get that. It's not possible to get a bad end alone, without it being close to a romance.\n\nThe illustrations are divided, the backgrounds are fairly bad - not very detailed and convincing, but it's nothing that I mind.\nThe character illustrations however, are really well done, with great exspressions and convincing faces.\nHowever, the "special" illustrations for special story scenes are not that great, but fairly ok.\n\nThe story is mostly really good, though some cliches, and a bit overly dramatic usually - which ends up in a not that convincing story overall. It must be said, the stories are still moving, and put a large smile on my face and at the same time put a tear in the corner of my eye.\n\nThe rest is a standard visual novel gameplay, one downside is max resolution is 720, so fullscreen can have some pixelation, something that should never happen in a 2016 game.\n\nCONCLUSION\nYou need some knowledge about anime popular culture, as it's set in Japan and (clearly) made by some anime, visual novel, Japan fan.\nIf you enjoy visual novels, it's a good choice to spend about 10 hours on. Especially if you enjoy dating sims.\nIf you don't know if you enjoy Visual novels, it's a ok first time try, as it's short and easily overcome - therefore a better choice than something long (however amazingly great)\nIf you don't really enjoy visual novels, but still might buy it - it's possible you'll enjoy it, but it's not a recommended choice.","March 31","true","8.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Sometimes it's the horribly annoying cliches, sometimes it's the cringe-worthy character interaction, sometimes it's both, but I never felt any of that with this, I was invested in it the whole entire time, through every route and with every character. Granted, the game is fairly short, about 2 hours a character, if even that (especially using the skip option,) but I felt thoroughly satisfied with every route. I honestly only bought this game for the extremely pleasing aesthetics, but I was pleasantly surprised when I started going through the routes. It's more than just a generic cliche-fest, there's genuine character development that makes you feel for all the characters. The endings that didn't make me straight out cry, tugged at my heart strings. I can't recommend this VN enough, especially for people who don't play very many of them. It's short, yet very powerful.","January 24","true","7.0"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

There is only one route I haven't played because I think I would be uncomfortable reading it. But I have gone through everything else in the game.\n\nThe Good:\n- The common route is great, there are several hilarious conversations with the characters. Its nice to watch them live out their lives.\n- While the common route is fairly light-hearted, the routes tend to be much darker. I don't know how many times I muttered "holy ♥♥♥♥" to myself.\n- The music is pretty great. My favorite track is probably "Don't Wake Me From This Dream", which plays at a very fitting moment.\n- The art is very good. It is very detailed and does a good job of creating the setting.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n- It hard to read when you are crying.\n- At the time of writing, there are several bugs, at least half pertaining to the date. While the demo did start in April, the full games starts in May. Then goes to June. Then jumps back to May, goes through to August, and jumps between July and August for the rest of the game.\n- Megumi's route is good but it has some issues. They start in with the common route actually. If you make choices torwards her, you don't see some characters or do some events. Which is fine, except the route still references these previously unknown details. It was a little jarring to the experience, especially since I was on her route my first play through.\nMegumi's route doesn't develop her to much. Even when they get an interesting chance to get more at her later on, it felt like there was only a sentence or two about it.\n\nThe Confused:\n- Are there supposed to be four after stories? I only got one of them even though the menus tell otherwise.\n- I have no idea what the tongue comment means in one of the bad ends.\n\n\nOverall, I very much recommend the game. The story is well written, and the mystery elements are great too. Do give yourself a few days to feel depressed though because it really does get dark.","January 20","true","15.8"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","1"

The common route works out fine so far, has some good banter between the protagonist and the other characters, but then you get into the heroine routes and with the two routes I've finished, it's only half and half. The Megumi route lacks any sense of cohesive logic and takes what could have been a decent story into something of a complete farce. It's about all I can say without posting spoilers, really - there's *no* logic to the Megumi route at all and it's highly unsatisfying because of it. The Yui route, however, was enjoyable enough, though I'll readily admit I'm sort of a sucker for that kind of story. Still have other routes to explore, so I can't definitively recommend or not recommend the game just yet. Currently I'd have to say no, but as I finish the other routes that could change to a yes. The sheer nonsense that came of the one route outwighs what I enjoyed in the other thus far.\n1-22-16\nAfter reading through the rest of the routes, I think I can recommend this overall. It's not perfect, but the highlight was definitely the Chinatsu route. I don't know if only one person did the writing or if it was a team effort, but the writer of that route did a great job of putting together a story for the theme it fits in as. It did an excellent job of both plot and character interaction, and it's my favorite of the heroine routes.\nOverall, it her really good artwork (though the protagonist still looks too much like Ryo to me) and the music is good. For the writing, overall it tends to excel more at character interaction rather than plot.","January 20","true","11.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Had a bit of money, was bored out of my mind. Wanted to do something that was a change to my normal pace. Came across this game by accident and thought it would be amusing. Upon first impression, it looked like some typical anime love story. What could possibly entertain me more than that?\n\nThe first part of the game is a warmup. The decisions you make will determine who you end up "with" in the second half of the game. Once that's said and done, you start spending time with the person the game selected for you (no real choice, it's whoever you paid the most attention to in the game). It's adorable, it's funny, it's awkward. A bunch of teenagers just going through high school. I graduated high school two years ago, so I easily relate to the situations.\n\nBut low and behold, this game had more in mind for me than anticipated. As the second half of the game progressed, it became more fundamentally obvious that this game was about to take a dark turn. Though with the girl I "picked" (I basically just went with the flow and ended up with Megumi), I had no idea it was gonna turn in the direction it did. Sure there are "happy, good" endings to this game, but it's dark side, the side that gripped me most, was a helluva lot more than I bargained for. After finishing all scenarios (Shiro's getting to me the most cuz all endings for her are depressing regardless), I will have to take a couple of weeks/months before I have the energy or will to do this again.\n\nThis game was riveting. From beginning to end I found myself wanting more. The sheer anticipation of learning about these characters kept me playing. I don't obsess over stuff like this at all, but it's even more rare for me to get emotionally attached to something. This was no exception. I legitimately felt like I was in the main character's shoes from start to finish. I felt everything he felt. More importantly, I experienced intense drama that I haven't seen in a long time. This is a novel. If you want a more interactive game, I do not recommend it. But if you are like me and look for plot, development, and/or emotions, this game I would recommend first for years to come.\n\nThank you developers for the experience. I hope to be able to delve into your next creation with as much excitement as I leave this game with. I give this game a 9/10.","February 14","true","16.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

But sadly the Shiro route only has two bad endings and my guess the girl with the glasses, only has one ending. This makes me feel very ripped off on those two routes.\n\nStill I recommend this game for the other two girl routes and not the ones with the bad endings.\n\nI hope the creator might not only make an update with voices added to the game, but also put some good endings to the routes I mentioned...","February 17","true","9.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Also the game was allot longer than i thought it would be, seriously i was losing my voice for reading this outloud in one sitting! Would i recommend this game to anyone? A thousand times yes! In my opinion this is one of the best VN's to come out this year, and finally the rating, i know every review i do i give the games 10/10's and this one is no exception, my rating for No One But You is and outstanding 10/10 if you're thinking about buying this game then do it because you won't be disappointed!

Weird to have a Japanese theme song without it actually having Japanese audio. The text itself is fairly good although there are too many typos for my liking and other errors like dates/days not matching the text. It somewhat breaks the immersion in the story. Overall I'd say it's worth a go if you like visual novels. Otherwise it might not be the best if it's your first one ever.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Barrowsx/recommended/367020/","Barrowsx","Dick Cheney","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Barrowsx/","271 products in account","DISCLAIMER: So far, I have only fully played through two routes: Megumi and Yui. Odds are that I will forget to update this review, but I believe that just the two routes give me at least a basic understanding of the game.\n\nNo One But You, as far as VNs go, was fairly engaging. Nothing about it will blow your mind, but it has some nice meta humor coupled with more standard jokes and quips during the introduction. However, once you finally get to one of the characters' specific routes, things start to get depressing and tense very quickly.\n\nWith my first playthrough, I was on Megumi's route, and this route is easily the weaker of the two I played. While I found it fine for the most part, there was one specific plot element that I found to feel somewhat shoehorned in to raise the stakes. Yui's route felt much less intense than Megumi's route, but this felt better to me, since it didn't have the feeling of "raising the stakes" that Megumi's route had. After playing Yui's route, I have somewhat high hopes, but I still feel skeptical of the quantifiable difference in quality between the two routes I played.\n\nOverall, I would say that this was worth the $9. While the art is nothing special, it isn't bad, and the characters (at least Megumi and Yui) feel decently fleshed out in their respective routes, although they get very little screen time during other routes. This isn't the best VN you're going to play, but it's still worth a good playthrough at least.","January 21","true","3.8"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"
