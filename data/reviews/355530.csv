Everything about this title is charming - the dialogue is humorous and moves the storylines along, the puzzles require a bit of dumb luck but once you dig through the game and find them all the setting feels pretty robust.\n\nThe gameplay is split into two components: 'Investigation' and Conversing. Through investigating the setting and speaking to characters who inhabit the space with you, you gain mastery and experience on a handful of intersecting plotlines. The conversing 'mini-game' is almost like playing three games of Rock-Paper-Scissors at once. Each step you take towards defeating your opponent results in a different 'stat' losing some of it's power. These different tiers are set atop an actual game of R-P-S... so starting out it seems more complicated than it is.\n\nThe only negative comment I'd say regarding this fun game is because of how the gameplay is configured there is quite a bit of repetition both in investigating, purchasing items, and winning conversations. This is relatively minor due to the short length of the title (and I was playing to 100%, which I hit around 10 hours).\n\nIt's pretty remarkable for how polished this game is in it's current state given the small staff. I hope we see more in this Tale of Last Words!","July 12, 2015","true","16.9"," 41 of 43 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","41","43","0","0"

It's a satire on aristocracy and a comment for the methods of conversation followed by the educated elite to gain power in dialogue and various discourses alike. It also is a humorous mystery that you might very much enjoy.\n\nProfessor Chatt Chatters, the esteemed engineer and a well-respected nobleman throws a dinner party to announce his latest invention, an odd item speculatively capable of deeming the possessor undefeatable during civilized discourse or any kind of debate. In other words, he can have the "Last Word" in every conversation! Guests - selected from various members of other noble houses and excellent conversationalists - await on the appearance of this infamous invention as they enjoy the hospitality of their host with a selection of fine melon wines. Witty Gawship - a photographer and a member of the now fallen Gawship House - is also among guests for reasons unbeknownst to her. As the night progresses and the state of affairs enabling this unconventional social gathering reveal slowly, Witty investigates the power of this odd machine and Professor's motives furthermore. Can she get the "Last Word" and save the night, and the honor of Chatters' guests?\n\nAs you can so far observe, this is the quite unconventional JRPG with a unique battle system and an investigation process. We play the game as Witty; conversing with guests, collecting gossip or chatter and use our gathered information to reach certain means and ends. As we explore the secrets of the mansion and its guests, fragments of seemingly unrelated topics come into portray an interesting and curious series of events. Aside your investigation, you are expected to participate in a battle game - namely, discourse - with other guests to sharpen your conversation skills and gain level with each victory.\n\nGame dynamics for this discourse process consist of a complicated rock-paper-scissors game form with the balance between different stats and abilities. It's easy to understand, yet a bit harder to master; but it certainly is interesting as a fresh breath of air compared to the millionth JRPG with attacks, magic, defenses and items. Here, you are given tone of voice and a selection of comments being either disruptive, submissive or aggressive as means of battle. You carefully juggle all these abilities in a duel of conversation to be able to gain the upper hand by the end of the dialogue.\n\nThe settings and the display arrangement remind Cluedo games with guests depicted on single color panels and an elaborate series of intrigues concerning guests and their pasts. It's one of the better uses of RPGMaker that I've seen, I have to say. Aside the cute gameplay, the whole setting serves as a lovable game centering an odd mansion, a collection of guests and an exciting mystery. All that we are missing is a murder!\n\nIf you are interested in a little mystery and appreciative for a parody of high society and their manners of elocution; feel free to try this gem. The whole experience takes approximately 6-10 hours depending whether you are using a guide or not.

And that's why the guests of professor Chet Chatters find themselves in a pickle. He's created a machine that enables him to win every conversation, which allows him to control the minds of others as if they were hypnotized.\n\nWhitty Gawship, a photographer who doesn't fit in with the rest of the crowd, is the only one who might be able to overcome the machine's influence and escape the professor's clutches. But first she has to get better at conversations, as the battle system consists of each opponent flinging words at each other.\n\nIt seems simple at first, until you aquire a couple of skills to make it more strategic.\nYou gather power, convert it into tact, then smash through your opponent's defenses to get the last word.\nTo do that, you have three types of conversations to choose from, all with different inflections. So why not choose the most powerful every time? Because there's also a rock-paper-scissor-element that you need to take into account. Choose the one that defeats your opponent's previous tone and he will lose composure, which makes aggressive conversations all the more powerful.\n\nIt's an interesting concept, but the ressource gathering feels a bit exhausting at times. It would have been fine if there were only a handful of battles, but I must have done them dozens of times to get as much as possible out of the game. Finding every secret can alleviate it somewhat, however. And if you like the system, there are additional challenges to choose from. They're far from impossible, but it took me a couple of tries.\n\nIs the story worth it at least? If you like that kind of setting and lots of dialogue, certainly. Especially if you try to uncover the entire mystery. It's not going to blow your mind, but it's nice enough.\n\nWhat I didn't particularly like was the design of the character sprites. There's no real reason for them to be colored blobs walking through an otherwise well designed world. Having them wear color-coded outfits would have been fine.\n\nAll in all, a nice rpg-maker game that I would certainly recommend. It might not stay with you for long, but it's good enough to spent about 5 hours with.","May 8, 2015","true","8.3"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","33","37","0","0"

From the moment the game starts. You understand these characters and their motivations. However underneath their smears and grins, lies something hidden, untold, a dark secret. Like an Agatha Christie novel you will unravel the mystery of the mansion, its guest, and the mysterious host. Last Word is a extremely well written game. Criss-crossing the stories of the characters in clever fashion. The battle system for the "Last Word." While confusing at first becomes very easy to grasp and master. However there is more to be found. With secrets hidden around the estate, and abilities, key subjects to be leveled. Simply put, Last Word is something unique and something new. I loved every minute of it. From the artstyle and the way characters are drawn. To the creepiness of its more supernatural overtone. It all blends perfectly. Now there is a few blemishes on this game. No resolution control or ability to cross reference gossip becomes time consuming. However these minors annoyances are easily overlooked. This reviewer sincerely hopes there is a Last Word 2.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/8_bdx7YS0EM\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","May 16, 2015","true","8.9"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"

It is extremely clever and I don't believe I have seen a game with a battle system/basis this unique. These battles are actually called "Discourse" in the game. See, in this world, people can temporarily command and gain power over others by winning arguments or conversations. It is hilarious to watch it all unfold. You can purchase skills like "firm handshake" and "elegant smirk" which give you bonuses to tact and verbal power. Equipment consists of bow ties, and the more bow ties you have the more skills you can equip. Once you win a discourse you get people to perform actions you need to advance the story, such as giving you the password to a safe or opening a door. Also, by gossiping and/or chattering with other characters you unlock new information about characters, events, and/or objects. Chatter is more for progressing the story and is a bit more character specific. Last thing I will mention on actual gameplay; you can also buy information on topics.  (The exp points you gain from finding information and winning a discourse are dollars which you spend on the afformentioned topics and/or skills). I spent $20 on wine information and was able to spot new items I previously saw as ????. With those items, I unlocked more gossip and chatter with different characters, and thus I was able to advance the plot. This was a relatively short, but memorable game. Along with the wonderful battle structure and skill progressions mentioned above, the game has beautiful water-color like 2D graphics. It reminded me of older titles like Suikoden 2 (with bolder colors) or more recently, LISA. The soundtrack and sound effects in this game also contributed greatly to the unique charm the game has. You could wait for a sale but it is easily worth its normal price of $10.","July 9, 2015","true","3.5"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

The game sorta pitches itself as having dialogue-based "combat", but I don't really feel that's the case. You speak to NPCs as you would in any other RPG in the non-combat phases, but when you enter the "combat" phase, it's more of a rock-paper-scissors game where "rock" and "paper" have been renamed abstract concepts like "power" and "aggression". No actual dialogue happens during "combat" at all. It's all abstract.\n\nThere is more to the combat to make it more complicated (and arguably more convoluted) where there is a sort of tug of war game you're trying to win, and in order to use certain tact-based types of attack options, you first have to build up a requisite stat by using power-building attack options first so that you can sacrifice power to gain tact. It's a weird system with a lot of different types of points and meters, where you sacrifice your A points to build up your B points so that you can sacrifice your B points to use a C attack, but your enemy uses a D attack which lowers your E points, etc etc. The game does a very poor job of explaining how all of this works, so you just have to keep talking to your one practice NPC over and over again until you start to make sense of it.\n\nAt the end of the day, the game feels to me like rock-paper-scissors needlessly complicated with ten different types of points/meters to watch.\n\n"Dialogue fights" is a cute idea in theory, but that's not really what ends up happening in practice, and what does end up happening in practice I just didn't take much of a fancy to.","May 7","false","0.3"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

It's always nice to see an RPG use an unusual setting, and one in which veteran military linguists are revered as paragons of citizenry is a rare thing indeed. The custom battle system uses a rock-paper-scissors element, but as part of a resource-based system that makes choosing to use or ignore the rock-paper-scissors elements on a given turn an important decision in both the short and mid- to long-term. It's not a tens-of-hours affair, but it does take several hours, and you spend the whole time learning new things about the characters and the world they live in. I recommend it to anyone who likes their RPGs to mix things up.\n\nRead the full review at  IndieGames.com.

The voice acting is very minimal, but that just adds to the overall feeling of the game, instead of full on sentences being spoken, you will hear scoff and sighs, giving more character to the characters.\n\nAlthough Last Word has a serious air to it with the discourse and the attire, the game is far from serious. There are many little funny things in the game, such as arguing with a cat and even the characters names.\n\nI would recommend Last Word to anyone who wants to experience a game that is different from the generic RPGs that are churned forth from the gaming system, and to anyone else who just wants to play a good game with a great plot.","May 16, 2015","true","10.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

Leaving players without challenge towards the end of the game.\n-Text heavy adventure: Terrible for those who don't like to read in their vijeo games\n-Really short (but worth it).\n\nThis short little game is impressive and I feel like it did everything right. I'm more of ahardcore gamer myself, I love things like Dwarf Fortress, FTL, or anything that'll give me a bit of a challenge. I'm also a sucker for a good story though, and I like anything that'll make me start wrapping my brain around it. This game is heavily story driven with a mixture of clue and RPGness. And everything works together towards the goal of not only telling the story, but creating a believable setting.\n\nWhile others have stated that the game doesn't properly explain the 'Whys' of the setting (why getting the last word has power in this world), the game does take the time to nod at this and pretty much say that the residents of this world don't know, and in turn, we the audience won't know (though maybe it is discoverable in an alternate ending)? Whatever the case may be the developers are excellent writers. We have a variety of characters, some are complicated and will be developed over the course of the game (IE, the servant and Seymore) while others are simple and 'translucent.' What you see is what you get, but they also have their own sort of depth (their dreams, their hopes, etc). Even the most unlikable characters will have redeemable qualities and will make some common cause with the protagonist. In the end, not all characters need to be deep complicated messes, and not all mysteries will necessarily be 'solved.'\n\nAnd the combat mechanics plus unlockable abilities meant that as soon as you started to get into the swing of things you would start delving deeper into this elegantly simple but complicated system. The AI has trouble properly exploiting this, but it 'knows' enough to provide a challenge over the course of the game. By the end I was consistently winning and I would have been bored if it dragged on much longer. As it is, just enough challenge was coded in to last me until I reached the first ending.\n\nWhich was fine because in a way this is a game about discovery and exploration, most of which is buried in dialogue. If you do get this game I recommend you save between chapters (right before the next chapter) in different slots. This way you can return to an old chapter to review certain conversations, which might advance some story elements towards the end of the game.\n\nAgain, if you like to read AND play video games, this game is likely for you. Hopefully you'll enjoy it as much as I did.","July 14, 2015","true","8.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

If you miss any of\nthese events, you will be unable to complete the game to 100% (make sure you check out all the achievements before you start playing if you want to 100% it)\n\n-> fair amount of grinding required, could really use a "speed up" button for combat (and also for the text boxes, especially if you are doing another playthrough)\n\n-> combat mechanics may not be readily intuitive for players, even with the tutorial and help menus; practice and trial-and-error will help you improve\n\n-> during combat, the characters don't actually say anything (but this is understandable given the scope of the game); for example, I was hoping that when I performed a powerful aggressive move my character would refer to the conversation that initiated the combat\n\n-> current price might be too much - you can complete the game in maybe 4-5 hours if you are speeding through it and not trying to achieve 100% completion; I achieved 100% in about 7 hours\n\nNow on to the POSITIVES: ^_^\n\n-> very interesting story with plenty of extra lore (if you choose to explore it), robust characters with engaging personalities\n\n-> unique combat system that can be very satisfying when you get used to it and start to chain powerful combos\n\n-> pretty artwork and presentation, simple but elegant\n\n-> good music\n\n-> requires you to return to the game if you wish to 100% it (more info in the Steam community boards)\n\n-> helpful developer (as seen in the Steam community boards)\n\n-> has Steam trading cards\n\n-> controller support (very useful because you will be spamming the "Ok/next" button a lot if you are a quick reader)","July 21, 2015","true","7.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You start as a nobody getting your ♥♥♥ kicked, and by the end you are kicking ♥♥♥.\n\nIt took me about an hour to figure out the combat system. The short tutorial  and written notes (see below) do not really convey what is going on, stick with it, it is more fun when you are winning. As other reviewers have mentioned, it is like a complex game of rock, paper, scissors. To this, you add special abilities that are granted from a collection of bowties. It is a pretty good system with a wide range of variation.\n\nTo play the game you should know the following:\nAlt + Enter = full screen (the game mentions "red pegs" several times. I never saw them until playing fullscreen)\nF1 = Game Properties (tweak sounds, and remap keys)\nF12 - Pause\nTo save, load, adjust options, and read the instructions, you need to find the floating bowtie. It is outside on the patio. From the start hallway, go right (past the bathroom), through the room with the blue floor, then down. You'll be outside with trees and flowers, the mystery bowtie floats in the air here.\nTo get through doors, walk over their red threshold. I spent two hours thinking I had to aim for the grey bit at the top, and just assumed the doors were locked :)\nYou can wear more than a single bowtie at once.","January 25","true","13.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There's some strategy involved in its RPG elements and the combat that it has, and definitely picks up the variety when using perks as it leads to some more interesting choices, however the game does lack the oompf behind the battle to really make it stand out. It would have been interesting to really dictate the conversations in battle and actually put substance behind it, and while the main story does have some interesting aspects to it, it does miss a bit at least on my side for some of the interesting ways it could have gone. In the end, it's a good start for the idea, but it's not worth the full price of admission, at least not with what's here. Pick it up when it's something like 3-4 bucks.\n\n+:\n- Once options open up, some good elements to combat and does keep me interested in the back and forth. Knowing when to go for weakness and when to back off.\n-The idea of themes of one-way communication and the idea of the lack of listening play well.\n-Some interesting characters involved that I want to know more about.\n-The idea of discovering topics and everything is rather well implemented.\n\n\n-:\n-Feel like the weakness meter could have more elements to play with it however. There's no reason to ever go once you've maxed it, as it seems it can't reduce in any way.\n-Combat wise it would have left a mark if they actually discussed things rather then just have the sword/flame/etc animations. Would have added a level of immersion to the game.\n-RPS gameplay at times is too simple with the weakness. Felt like there needed to be an element to add another layer of strategy.\n\n\nFor more information and gameplay: http://youtu.be/KvOl35KSjd4","May 9, 2015","true","2.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

The game is built around the idea that words are power, and the better you are at getting your point across the more powerful you are.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPros:\n\n-Difficulty\nLearning the mechanics of the game was a bit of a hassle for me. At first I was losing every single argument left and right because the instructions were to be honest a bit frustrating. Though after your 5th match you start to understand the concept. And by the end of the game you will without a doubt fully grasp how conflict works in this universe.\n\n-Story Ritch\nI would have never thought I could learn so much lore in a story just by repeatedly talking to the same people over and over but truth be told. There is a very big story in the game that goes outside of the initial story that the player can ever touch. Just pay attention and read everything that people have to say, it's well worth your time.\n\n-Graphics\nThe graphics in this game are very unique. My honest opinion wavers greatly on this subject because for a game like this, I don’t think graphics was one of their main concerns, but! i will say that they did put a lot of well-done detail into the games environment, and the use of colors for the characters makes a lot more sense once you’ve ventured further into the game.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCons:\n\n-Repetitive\nI suppose any kind of mind game would be repetitive if you had to do it over and over and over and over again. For a con part of a review, this argument is actually very weak, but the repetitive factor is still there so I think I should at least state that it can occur. But honestly it’s like playing checkers, playing 700 matches of checkers non-stop can be repetitive for anyone as well. The game did do a good job however about giving each player their own play style so no 2 matches are alike, That being said, if you’ve played against a single character enough times you learn their strategies and you can play around it flawlessly!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI rate this game a 9.5/10\nFor its price, and originality.\nIt has earned a near perfect rating from me.\n","September 5, 2015","true","5.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a perfect fit for it, but the story is definitely where your attention will be.\nBasically this is rock-paper-scissors with strategy, levels, and special skills. If that does not appeal to you then you need to play it anyway so you can be proven wrong.\nYou spend turns choosing from 9 options depending on two resources, 2 of which are gained from 3 each of 6 total of the 9 options, the last 3 being "attacks." Each set of three has three types, with one option to each type per set of three options. Type 1 beats 2, 2 beats 3, 3 beats 1. Matching these favorably gives you a bonus to your attack, and your resources if you have certain skills equipped.\nThere are levels involved, but it's quite easy to level up. You just need to spar, you'll level up even from failing.\n\nThat's pretty much it, actually. Granted, it's very likely I'm missing things as I just played through from start to finish and it's currently 3 A.M. as I write this, so please forgive any errors or general stupidity on my part.\n\nCommentary - This was fantastic. It's a brilliant idea, a wonderful execution, and lovable if not memorable characters. (Well over 90% of which is due to the shortness of the game rather than lack of good writing. I'd go so far as to say 98-99% even.)\n\nMy only complaint (if it can be called that) is that the "true ending" was really easy to figure out, and the final post-credits scene difference was obvious to predict. (This is assuming there aren't multiple endings based on who you pick after the final code. I'm sure I'll be finding out some other time.)\n\n\nEverything below this I'll classify as "spoilers," though I'll attempt to avoid them:\n\n\n\n\n- I love the option to discourse Mew. The first time I could talk to her I was ecstatic at the thought, and the later ability to do so is fantastic. (Especially since she's the strongest character.)\n- Entirely irrelevant, but the scene involving copying the "word" gave me major deja vu, which I consider a good thing.\n- Seymour seemed to be unaffected by the Last Word at one or more points, I've already forgotten the specific instances.\n- While the ending was nice, it was greatly annoying to not know that the final code was impossible to get. I swear I counted every tile it seemed in an effort to figure it out.\n- Similarly, I find it fitting that the final line gives the last word to Boasting, even though the line that followed from the beginning was used. I realize I worded that horribly, but even that seems fitting to me personally. :P\n- Definitely worth the 10 dollars. Every cent, for the story at least, if not for the gameplay.","August 27, 2015","true","7.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And it works absurdly well! The idea to use conversation as a combat mechanic is quite well done, and the skills and abilities, while powerful, never feel so overwhelming that the game becomes unbalanced - in much the way that old rpgs expected a player to grind up to max level to survive the final boss, a player needs to reach almost the pinnacle of conversational acumen to stand against the verbal hail of the last boss (and the secret boss). Further, this rarely, if ever, hits the point of formula - you cannot rinse and repeat every opponent, and more than a little thought is required to reach victory every time. More importantly, this game is fairly short - hitting the pinnacle takes only a few hours, tops - the grind is barely noticable. I finished my first run in ~8 hours, and that was because I was trying to get 100% completion.\n\nThe writing is the gem in this piece, and it comes through very well. In originality, if nothing else, the script nails its goals precisely, and with a lot of panache. It's like the most civil attempt to slaughter a dinner party by cutting wit alone. The sound effects are also pretty good, and there is some minor voice acting (You too will want to slug Seymour by the end!) which adds to the experience. Replay value is a little limited - there are some clear points where you will know you missed something, and the game is short enough that such hints will tempt you into a replay, but I only see someone going after 2 or 3 rounds of it initially. The mechanics and skill to win may see you firing up the game again every once in a while (the end boss fights are really quite amusing), so save just before the end, but otherwise? meh.\n\nThe visuals are quite simple (but pretty stylish, all the same), and the exploration, while extensive (there are almost no details that won't matter at some point), is by no means large (effectively, the game takes place in 4 rooms, with exploration being limited to using various topics to unlock different reactions).\n\nThe music is pretty good, if not spectacular.\n\nTLDR; Game rates an 8 out of 10 as a fun, story driven romp with clever mechanics.","January 11","true","28.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Instead of battle options like "Fight," "Magic," and "Item," Last Words offers conversation options like "Disruptive" and "Aggressive." You get exp, gain levels, and learn skills, just like in a normal RPG, but here you are learning skills like "Firm Handshake" to improve your conversation ability. I like the novelty of the game, and the conversation battle system is actually pretty well implemented. (It requires some strategy, etc.) If you like RPGs, then this game is probably worth a play through just for the novelty.\n\nPros:\n+ Unique game\n+ Conversation-based battle system works well and is fun\n+ Story is pretty good--also unique and imaginative\n\nCons:\n- Game is pretty short, and the world is very small, lacking variety. (Basically, the whole game takes place in one room, and there are only a handful of "enemies" you "fight" over and over.)\n- Game gets a little tedious and repetitive after a while\n- I found the ending pretty unsatisfying.

Everything's custom. And I mean everything, from sound effects to battle mechanics. On top of that, it's quality. The story and characters are fun. The graphics are good (for pixel art). The music is excellent.\n\nThe battle system isn't JRPG at all; instead it's a very tactical affair where you try to move a slider back and forth, with various combinations of skills you or your opponent can have to change the mechanics up. It's themed as "discourse", but don't worry, you don't need actual conversation skills, nor is it a CYOA/VN style arrangement. Grind is present to acquire new abilities, but minimal if you are skilled and take the exp-increasing skill early. Seymour's your best bet for that. You can often defeat someone at half their level.\n\nOn the whole I highly recommend this game as something new and different, but it does have a few cons:\n* It did crash just one time - apparently a script hang.\n* Little frustrating to 100%, unless you want to follow the guide posted here on Steam.\n* While the combat system is very good, it is also poorly explained. My advice is to go in blind, then check the help available thru the floating bow tie to fill in the gaps.\n\nNo one dies in this game, if that's a plus for you.","April 7","true","17.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The first part is investigating topics by talking to other guests that's locked in the mansion with you. You investigate and gather informations about key topics and you use it to move the story forward.\n\nThe second part, that is the meat of the game, is the discourse, the battle system. In this game, conversation is serious business, and having the last word can give you literal domination toward your discourse partner.\n\nIt's basically one-on-one turn-based rpg battle. But you don't take turn stabbing each others with swords of course. You take turn in abstract discussions, and try to gain the last word.\n\nYou have choices on what to do. You throw disruptive remark to mostly gain power. You can throw submissive remark to trade your power with tact, and finally you can throw agressive remark to actually move the conversation toward your end. Other than that there are things you must consider, like your and your opponent's composure, which is basically your defenses, the tone of conversation (tones have paper-rock-scissors relationship, and they have different effects or can destroy your opponent's composure), and of course various personal skills everyone have.\n\nBasically, a pretty charming and stylistic twist on typical turn-based rpg.","May 4","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game focuses on on a rather peculiar such happening in high society of St. Laud where a mystery is afoot. Suspect in the happenings of the evening are the various movers and shakers of the government, military and other important individuals, but among them all stands a strange outlier, yourself.  In the role of Whitty Gawship the peculiarities of the evening are secondary to just why you've been invited to these proceedings while having no such lofty status.\n\nThe cast is literally colorful, being color-coded to their affiliations.  That they're all interesting with their own experiences and perspectives on the higher functions of St. Laud will be quickly apparent.  Through the combined information one discerns from the lips that sink ships lie the answers to all the questions you will wade through as the evening progresses, the ominous proceedings and circumstances ever on the forefront of the minds of the guests. Getting the last word can seem daunting at first, but thankfully there are many ways for you to improve your gift of gab and show the shakers and snobs that you are not a woman with whom is to be messed.\n\nThe visuals and music set the tone of the game effectively, with classically inspired pieces befitting a higher function ranging from relaxing to more pressing matters as the hours pass and the wine runs empty. Connoisseurs of the sparkling finest and the flow of conversation both will at the same time become more tense and verbose. Among all of the discussion, gossip, chatter, intrigue and investigation only one thing is for certain.\n\nOne photographer would like to have a word.","January 3","true","7.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You may think this to be something close to the Ace attorney series, but the heated conversations are instead compressed into a kind of turn-based battle system. The "battles" are fun, but the game involves rather heavy grinding to pad out the gameplay, and you're forced to grind the same opponents over and over to progress. The game just isn't complex enough to handle that.\n\nBut my main problem with the game is the story. It's an alternative reality tale set to an alternate mid-20th century Britain where for reasons unexplained, having the titular "Last Word" in a conversation gives a person control over another. The game does throw some cool and interesting ideas about this premise around, but the premise isn't established properly at the start, and there are several internal inconsistencies in the logic of the game. The main villain's scheme, the crux of the plot is also so incredibly embarrassingly nonsensical, that it renders any weight or threat from people being "trapped". Also, be prepared for lots of word-related name-puns.\n\nThe visuals and sound are actually pretty good for an RPG maker game.\n\nFor 10€, there's SO much better thing you could get.  I paid half of that, and so far I don't think I'm going to get my money's worth.\n\nGive this one a pass, unless you feel like supporting the devs.","May 29, 2015","false","2.6"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","3"

Pretty much the entirety of the game play outside of battles consists of walking back and forth within the same couple of rooms, talking to each character over and over until you've exhausted all conversation topics trying to trigger the next story event, and then doing the same thing again and again once you do.\n\nFortunately, the actual combat portions of the game, which is probably the larger chunk of the game, is pretty good.  This is a game where the battle system actually gets better the further you progress.  While at first it may seem a bit random and confusing, as you continue to level up and gain new skills it becomes considerably more strategic and satisfying, as your options in battle increase quite a bit.\n\nThe game is on the short side; I was able to get both endings in just over five hours, and I imagine it would be fairly similar for everyone else.  And the only real replay value comes in the form of starting the game over again just to do things that you accidentally locked yourself out of doing the first time (which is annoyingly easy to do).  So, I probably would not recommend getting the game at its full price, as I don't think the amount of content justifies the cost.

The battle system is pretty fresh but easy to manipulate once you get the hang of it, and for the length there is a lot of character and plot depth that you can explore. It felt to me somewhat similar to something I might have played on the GBA years ago or even the DS and was a little nostalgic, though that was at least partially because of the graphics.\n\nCons:\nThe battle system is a little tricky to learn at first, and complex enough that it's certainly possible to miss one or two elements of it in the tutorial, so if you don't pay close attention you can find yourself floundering some. Also if you don't look at all possible options for interaction you can find yourself lost about what the game wants you to do next at some points, but that tends to be fairly typical for a lot of adventure games.\n\nPros:\nDespite being tricky to pick up, once you understand all the elements of the battle system it becomes fairly easy to use even to defeat characters levels above you once you really get some experience with it. The Upgrade options make for some fun and useful customization to that end, and you don't even need to over-level by obscene amounts to get them all, plus some of them make leveling up pretty quick. You don't need to explore every nook and dialogue option in order to advance if you listen to the suggestions made by characters, but I recommend it if you want to learn everything you can about said characters and the story.\n\nIt's a pretty short game; certainly complete-able in an afternoon, but surprisingly satisfying for its length. The hours I have logged for it are the result of multiple playthroughs to get all the achievements... and the secret ending of course. :)","February 3","true","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first, it was a bit (way) too confusing, but things made sense afterwards. I personally think the game isn't too easy or too hard, it's just right.

You talk to guests and interact with the environment to get conversation topics/clues to advance the plot.\n\nIt is an RPG maker game, so it has the control and visual limitations of that engine, but the art style is still quite charming. The writing does get awkward and pretentious and the story is pretty far fetched, but the game is pretty fun when considered with the sum of its parts. The battle mechanics take some figuring out (be sure to read the guide at the save location!) but once you understand the nuances it becomes quite enjoyable.\n\nThe only thing that really bothered me is that there are a couple times where you are required to remember key words from past conversations that you have no logs of, and didn't really have the knowledge at the time to determine that certain words are important to remember. You either have to have a very good memory, or be prepared to look up answers online.","March 26","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The battle mechnism is well thought out.  There are times where you realize yes I can beat this individual 5 levels higher than me.  There are other times where you aren't quite sure if you are too close and then you lose.  The side quests are a nice edition.  Also the indicator which lets you know when you have fully discussed a topic with everyone is helpful.  I am about 65% done with the game.  So far it has been a really interesting game.","January 1","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My first time playing was a bit confusing and difficult, however I have the basic premise and the basic strategy down.  It's enough that I will invest another few hours and see where it goes.\n\nThis is an interesting indie game.  It has turn based play, which is fun and strategic, but not insanely hard.  The game has a mystery type narrative to it.  The story is mildly engaging.\n\nEverything is top down.  The music blends into the "dinner party" atmosphere of the plot.  The dialogue is all written... so no voice acting.\n\nOverall the game is good as a bit of a strategic, turn-based distraction.  I wouldn't pay much for this game, but it's good enough for casual play to pay a couple bucks.","March 19","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It feels like a mix between rock, paper, scissors, phoenix wright, and clue all wrapped up into a mystery rpg.  the main problem in this game is the INCESSANT amount of grinding you have to do.  I spent over an hour grinding to fight the 2nd boss.  The plot line if you go out of your way for every line actually goes ahead and gives you a fairly complex story, from Gawship house defunking, Seymour's mother running off with Prattle's son.  Among many other more deep plot points.\n\nOverall if you are looking for something different this is a shoe in.  If you are a fan of old turn-based rpgs in the likes of Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest you might want to look elsewhere.","February 24","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"battle" mechanics, which is basically an argument/conversation mixed with rock-paper-scissors and some resource management. Haven't played or heard of a game that does anything similar. It's unique, pretty fun, with an interesting story and interesting characters.\n\nThe only real fault I have with it, and it's not even the games fault really, is that it runs slow for me. I got this game in a recent Humble Bundle, along with Remnants of Isolation and Labyrinthine of Dreams, which use the same engine, and they're also slow, so it's obviously a problem with my computer. I also have the same problem Flash and Java based games.\n\nBut still, I definitely recommend this game.","July 15, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
