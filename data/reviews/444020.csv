It's all about raising and lowering tiles to drop the evil bee enemies into the water. It is, however, not about coffee, pots, or terrariums.\n\nWhile it may have taken me a bit to really understand the mechanics, they are fairly simple once you know them. The scenarios can definitely be challenging and might take a bit of thinking.\n\nDo note, this is really not a turn based tactics game as it sells itself. It's a puzzle game where you throw evil peeps into water.\n\nOverall, if you like zen puzzle games, this is the game for you. If it's on sale then it's all the more worth it.","June 4","true","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
