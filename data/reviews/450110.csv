"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daerphen/recommended/450110/","daerphen","Daerphen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daerphen/","2143 products in account","I got the key indirect from the developer to write this review. It didn't influence my recommendation\n\nI played this game for 2 days now and finished it after about 4 hours. I thought about it a while but finally came to the decision that I can't recommend it to everyone, but to those who are really fans of this genre or want to test their VR-Headsets.\nThe game isn't bad, but it's just not enough for a recommendation. If I have to give points, I would say it is a 5/10 where everything above 7 would get a recommendation.\n\nWhat I liked about the gameThe overall gameplay and atmosphere was very nice. During the 4 hours I was frightened from time to time. Not by jump scares, but by the overall atmosphere. Noises in the background, running out of battery. And the casual zombie/undead whats-o-ever around the corner.\nAnd I liked that it is a pacifistic game, you don't have a weapon or traps you use to fight enemies, but rather evade them.\n\nIf you have issues with the game you can expect an answer from the dev within the same day. Either he supports you with helpful tips or will fix it in a future update.\n\nWhat I didn't likeThe first thing I misliked came right at the start of the game. Well, actually before it even started. You have to manually install the C++ runnables from the Microsoft Website. Why not use Steam to install that. I know it's annoying to wait for them to install, but doing it manually was much more annoying. But ok, this is a one-time process...\n\nThen there is the main menu of the game. Nice idea starting in a cave and walking to the menu point. But to be honest, it took me over a minute to realize, that I have to walk to the floating text "new game" to be able to select it and it took me another 1-3 minutes to research for the button I have to press to interact with the menu item. Would have been awesome to just show the button text or key text instead of the word "interact".\n\nIt was very hard to follow the text and voice during the first cutscene, because the background audio was so loud, that I could hardly understand the talking. The subtitles helped a bit, if you look in the correct direction. After the cutscene I went to the menu, I saw a audio settings menu item, which can't be selected...\nSometimes during the game the voice talking and the subtitle are not the same, makes it harder to understand.\nThere are some errors in the texts, but since I am not a native speaker I won't comment or judge them.\n\nThe game itself starts with lowest video settings, not that big problem, but would have been nice, if it starts with your native screen resolution.\n\nReally annoying was the fact that when you interact with a document (pick up and read) your flashlight turns off and you have to manually turn if on again. Same procedure when you have to load from a savegame. It's funny when you sit there, waiting for the game to load but eventually move the camera and you see that you were just staring at a black, unlit location and the game was already loaded.\n\nI found the HUD not good. I misunderstood the battery icon for a long time. For me it fills over time and whenever I pickup a battery it drains my status... Perhaps it's just me, but I was confused in the first minutes.\nNext confusing thing was, when there was a earthquake. This made the HUD to dance around, but the camera was stationary. My impression was, that the HUD is some kind of smart goggles, but that wouldn't explain the dancing HUD. But ok, this situation doesn't appear too often.\n\nI guess the HUD is virtually floating in front of the camera. So whenever you are standing next to a wall or door the HUD will disappear in the wall :(\n\nConclusionIf you are a real horror fan and want to test your VR-Headset, go and grab the game. Maybe you want to wait till it appears in a bundle or it is on sale. But I guess you will like it.\n\nFor a one-man project this game is really good. It has really nice visuals and a nice atmosphere. But it is just not good enough for me to recommend it to all users.","April 20","false","5.3"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

While a lack of sprint key in a horror game is not automatically a terrible thing, it does start to feel like a ball and chain when there's as much constant backtracking required as there is here. Even with the sheer amount of save points lying around, death is an exhausting experience as you shuffle to regain lost ground, a particularly irritating example of which is tied to your light sources. Your flashlight requires a constant upkeep of batteries and so you will inevitably come to rely on the lighter to guide you, That is until you wander blindly into one of the game's many gas traps and blow yourself to pieces.\n\nAmigdala looks lovely and, although I played it on the desktop, I can imagine it would be incredibly immersive in the VR environment it was designed for. Mechanically, it's by-the-numbers; competent enough to wave through for fans of the horror genre but not a particularly convincing argument for it.\n\nFull video review below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dfHfMsBtO0","March 29","true","1.8"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","23","31","3","1"

And you all can guess that flashlight needs batteries. Games story is based on Philadelphia Experiments which was also one of my favorite subjects but the story is pretty much from b-class movie with all the cliches and voice acting is kind of horrid, but it is done by one man only so this can be forgiven since the games atmosphere is top-notch. One thing substracts from the experience is that sometimes you have no idea where to go and there is good amount of backtracking in this game (I did not finish it, but i will revisit this review later on since i am hooked).\n\nGraphics in this game are pretty damn nice(running with UE4) and it was primarily designed for VR support which can be pro/con depends who you ask (i do not have VR headset myself so i could not test it though). And you are much better off with controller than kb/mouse. Sounds also add to atmosphere and i recommend using headphones for this (i would recommend them for all horror games though)\n\nRating:\n8.0/10\n\nPros:Good graphics with good performance\nIt is scary!

Save game feature is available on designated locations only. At the end of chapter 3 and throughout chapter 4 it is getting more challenging and a bit frustrating due to the fact that save game locations are far apart. So if you mess up (in case of death), you have to do the whole thing again…\n\nOverall it is still a bit rough around the edges with regard to controls, display of in game text and object interaction. But this is because of its VR nature and it is not a big deal.\nIt is definitely worth the price and a recommendation for horror fans.","April 19","true","4.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragoonsz/recommended/450110/","dragoonsz","± Roger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragoonsz/","4396 products in account","Product received for free\n\nAmigdala\nDISCLAIMER: I received this product for no cost for the purpose of reviewing.\n\nAmigdala is a first-person horror game that puts you in the shoes of a man named Gherman. I won't go too much into the story to spoil it, but as you play the game, you're trying to uncover the secrets of an experiment that happened in the past. The game communicates to you via notes, memos and experiment logs that are left behind in the building. The game reminds me a lot of some older horror games such as Penumbra or Amnesia, but it still has some of it's own unique ideas. You can play the game with a virtual reality headset, or as is.\n\nGraphics: 8 / 10\n\nThe visuals are really well done. The game looks super nice, The animation quality is very good and there are some nice visual effects as well. There's an outdoor setting which looks fantastic. The indoor, dark and grimy areas are very atmospheric, which is what you would expect from a game like this, although that also makes it sort of a double edged sword. There are many games with this sort of atmosphere and environment. This horror setting has been done quite a few times, although as this title is newer, it does also have the nice shine and polished feeling when playing, that certainly adds to the experience as well as make the game look great. The game's graphics add to the atmosphere, and when playing with a VR set, it's even more immersive. The game is optimized very well. As good as the graphics are, it's not a very demanding game, which is a good thing. It should run perfectly fine on mid-tier graphic cards, as well as some lower end ones.\n\nSound: 7 / 10\n\nThe sound assets are very generic and standard "horror-game" sounds. Although that may sound harsh, it's not really a bad thing, as it IS a horror game and the sound assets get the job done. The sound does not get annoying or repetive, and does add to the atmosphere and immersive experience. The sound quality is decent, and playing this with a good headset, as well a VR set up can really suck you in. There is some voice acting in the game, and again, it was decent but not amazing. It got the job done.\n\nMechanics: 7 / 10\n\nThis is a little bit harder to rate as the game does not have many mechanics. It's not a "walking-simulator" but there also aren't many actions or things to  do . That being said, I don't believe the game actually needs more mechanics that it actually has, as it is a horror game that is meant to be more of an  experience  than anything else. You can use your lighter at times, and you do have to be mindful of battery life in your flashlight  ELSE IT'S LIGHTS OUT  (I thought it was a good pun). You can die from enemies and other certain situations, although enemies tend to move a bit slow (but then again, so do you). Hiding or running away from them are usually the best ways to deal with them as there are no weapons in the game, though it's easy to get lost within areas if you aren't careful.\n\nFinal Personal Remarks:\n\nI actually don't play many horror games, but I did like this one. I do agree with most statements saying that the game is a generic horror game, though it looked and sounded great. The background noises and wonderful graphics made it something nice., and yes, because of the atmosphere, I was on edge while playing, and filled with suspense. It's very well-made, and great for people who own VR sets. Its also very impressive that it was made by one person. I do think people who haven't played much horror games, should try it, as well as people who own any virtual reality consoles.\n\nThanks to the developer for giving me the opportunity to review the game, as well as anyone who took this review into consideration, I hope it helped.","June 5","true","6.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

(The additional play time listed was whilst the game was running but I was not playing)\n\nShort Review\nAn extremely atmospheric first person exploration/horror game which I found enjoyable for the first couple of hours but became a bit lack lustre after that.\n\nLong Review\nNote that although this game supports VR I did not play the game in this mode. I used my Xbox controller for the PC rather than the keyboard/mouse option that was also available. A number of different resolutions were available but if there was an option to run as a windowed application I didn't spot it so I played it in full screen mode, 1400x900 resolution. I found using headphones enhanced the experience significantly.\n\nThe idea of the game is to explore an abandoned military base in Greenland that is associated with the Philadelphia experiment and to discover what lies behind the experiment. The game is played in first person and you enter the base armed only with a flash light & a lighter. These become essential tools in underground areas with no lighting.\n\nThe opening area set the scene very well. The sound effects of footsteps in snow and the wind along with the spectacular scenery really gave a real feel for the environment. This building of atmosphere continues throughout much of the game.\n\nAs you move during the opening scene instructions are displayed on the screen informing you of the various controls.\n\nThe controls, whilst not entirely intuitive are easily picked up and work very well.\n\nI found the game to be VERY atmospheric, the audio & visual providing a suitably uneasy feeling.  I jumped when a light simply sparked. As for when I met the first adversary I died very quickly but mainly because I panicked, pressed the next use object key instead of the run key chose the lighter, managed to start running and promptly blew myself up running through some escaping gases and so died. Definitely no complaints about that as it was genuine panic I felt  and I had a good chuckle about it straight after :)\n\nThere is a display for the amount of battery left for your flash light and managing this becomes a key part of the game. You handily come across batteries that you can pick up and use; often enough that with careful management you can use your flash light intermittently to find your way around but not often enough to have it on permanently. You cannot store multiple batteries so you must remember where you came across them so you can return to pick them up when your flash light battery becomes low.\n\nAs far as I can tell you can use your lighter indefinitely but bear in mind its a naked light in a confined underground location with fractured pipes .. If you are careful you can often see split pipes and see & hear the gases escaping from them before you get close enough; other times the first time you know about escaping gas is a big BOOM\n\nWhen you can interact with an item this is clearly displayed on the screen. Typical items you can interact with are documents which you can read and handles you can turn.\n\nThere is a run button available which utilises a stamina meter which reduces as you run and once at zero you can't run until it recharges again.\n\nYou can only save at set points in the game and you are prompted on screen when you are at one of these points. If when you die you restart at your last save point.\n\nHaving good spacial awareness helps in this game, particularly with regards to turning handles which affects objects in the same XY but different Z co ordinates. Maybe having a compass bearing displayed on the screen would help?\n\nFor the first few hours the game was enjoyable but then I started to find that it became a bit tedious I'd get blown up using the lighter, return to my previous save point, redo the last 5 minutes again but this time swap the lighter for the flashpoint just before I got to the point where I knew the lighter would blow me up. I'd often find myself periodically returning to a save point which could involve several minutes travelling through empty corridors and then making the same journey back again just to ensure I didn't lose significant exploring time.\n\nIn the end I stopped playing because I appeared to have twiddled all the knobs available, explored all the areas I available and yet I couldn't figure out what to do next. I knew where a number of locked doors were but there was no interaction available for them. Maybe I just missed a lever somewhere or even an exit but the sad thing is I just got bored wandering around trying to find what I had missed.\n\nIt's a real shame because I was enjoying the game up until this happened and the game certainly has a lot of potential. Maybe when there are some walk throughs available for the game I'll revisit the it and slap my forehead, realising I'd missed something obvious. Sometimes that happens.\n\nI wanted to recommend this game but in all honesty I can't. Whilst I enjoyed it for a few hours I wanted to progress more than I did for me to give it the thumbs up. This is one review where if there was a neutal option I'd have selected it.\n\nProsVery atmospheric with good use of graphics and excellent use of audio to enhance the experience\nConsWhen I first went to play this game I got an error message warning that the C++ 2015 Runtime was required. I used the following link to download & install it https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/kb/2977003. I would usually expect the game installer to take care of this for me.\nThe initial introduction was a little fast for me to read, it could have done with a button press to proceed to the next screen. The issue did continue with dialogues, the text disappeared too quickly. Whilst there is audio at the same time it is heavily accented and the volume compared with the sound effects is low so the odd word can be difficult to make out and so referring to the text would be useful\nThis game suffers from the same issue many games of this type do, namely if you miss an object/opening you can wander around aimlessly for ages trying to find it. This is exacerbated when you are turning handles that affect things not in your immediate surroundings.\nOnce you locate the save points they are reasonably well spaced but if you don't happen to notice one (which happened to me) you can have a long walk back to the previous one.\nWhilst I could always see escaping gases with the flash light sometimes I couldn't with the lighter which seemed a bit odd - but maybe this was an issue with my graphics card, I'm not sure.\nI had one area where I could only pass one way through what appeared to be some blocks that were the remnant of the explosion that revealed the passageway into the area.\nMarks Out Of 5\n5) Must have - stop whatever you're playing now and play this\n4) Worth the asking price and considering as your next purchase\n3) Maybe purchase if you're stuck for choosing your next game or mildly discounted\n2) Only purchase if it is heavily discounted1) Not worth getting even if given away free\n\nWhere I got the game from\nA copy supplied indirectly from the developer via the Arise Giveaways Steam group for review purposes\n\nPlatform Played On\nIntel Pentium G3258 Anniversary Edition, 8Gb RAM, Palit GTX 750, Windows 10, Sades SA-708 headphones & XBox controller for the PC.\n\nThis made my platform right at the minimum specification for the game's system requirements but other than a few seconds delay between cut scenes the game ran very smoothly.\n\nMy best guess for a  PEGI Rating\n16: There is some profanity & plenty of blood & gore.

However, this did not influence my review in any way.\nAmigdala is a first person horror game. The protagonist is a conspiracy theorist who is trying to find evidence of secret experiments in the abandoned military facility.\nThere are no weapons. All you have is a lighter and a flashlight. You have to look for batteries all the time because flashlight runs out of juice quickly. Your magic lighter never runs out of gas but it doesn’t produce much light.  and you can accidently blow yourself up if you are not careful\nThe goal is to find secret documents, solve puzzles and not get killed.\n\nGood:\nNice visuals. The game runs on Unreal Engine 4 (with all its fancy lighting, reflections and particle effects) and looks great for an indie horror.\nVery atmospheric. There are very little jump scares (for me, it’s a good thing). Environment is very creepy and gives you chills.\nSound is good too (with only exception of a voice over, it needs work).\nGame runs well. It didn’t crash once. Steady 60FPS on my PC.\nCollectibles, achievements, trading cards (if you are interested in these).\nBad:\nStory is mediocre. Plenty of clichés.  crazy scientist, abandoned hospital / research facility, human experiments, etc\nIt can be confusing. There is no journal to track your progress. Sometimes you don’t know what exactly you need to do. You have to read and listen to everything carefully.\nYou can tell it’s a low budget indie game. Voice over and writing is not very good. Some areas of the game are recycled multiple times. Production value is nowhere near similar horror games like Outlast or Amnesia.\nThis game was designed with VR in mind, but I played it with keyboard and mouse just like a regular first person game and it plays very well without VR headset.\nI am giving Amigdala the thumbs up because I enjoyed it for what it is: a short, indie horror game with good graphics and great atmosphere.  The fact that this is developer’s first game and he “learned to use the engine, techniques and everything related to the development of a video game with this project” is quite impressive.\n\n\nHere are two things that you need to keep in mind if you consider buying this game:\nThe game is 2-4 hours long (may take longer to find all collectibles and get all achievements).\nLow budget, one man project with some minor glitches.\nIf you like horror games this one is definitely worth checking out.\n\nPC Specs:\nHardware Type   CPU Intel Core i7 5820K 3.30GHz   GPU Nvidia GTX 970   RAM 16GB DDR3   OS Windows 10 PRO\nMy playthrough:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZT-Rghx_YA\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlS2rwYM_-A\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_svH1oNSJY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_66OfdTrWU","April 6","true","4.4"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","13","20","0","0"

Unlike what the Steam notice says.  It supports VR but it's not required.\n\nYou may also need to reinstall MS Visual C++ 2015 redistributable.  But you can get that easy enough from MS site (or plenty of others).\n\nThe story is OK, but fairly typical of light horror (low gore and minimal psychological).  The controls are a pain in the backside but once your used to the semi-typical Unreal controls it gets better.  There are a few clipping issues and if you pick a book / paper you have to put it back facing the same spot or your locked there till you do. And there are a few clipping issues where boxes and what not come out farther than they look like they do.\n\nI won't go into the actual game but the atmosphere is just OK.  Others love it but it's a little bland for me.  That said you can blow yourself up if you use your lighter at the wrong spot .... so bonus marks for that.\n\nI'm missing something to unlock stuff.  So I wish there was a guide (there are vids but I don't speak Russian) or hint system in the game but it may just be my lazyness or mood.  If I come back to this game I may be able to 100% it at that point.\n\nOverall I would say this is a so-so game. However, this is not by a studio with programmers, model experts, voice actors, writers, etc.  It's a 1 person shop and I'm excited to see what the 2nd game from this kid will be like.\n1¢ Review Pro:\nOK story\nLight Horror\nGood looking\n\nCon:\nOccasional Bugs\nNeed Win C++ 2015 redistribute to be installed again\nVR needs non-minimal system specs\nNo jump and a few spaces where you can't get out without it\n\nPush:\nOK atmosphere\nVR or Non-VR works either way\nLots of save points\n\nOverall: 5/10 +1 graphics, +1 atmosphere = 7/10","May 23","true","6.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","1"

I'm pretty sure it was inspired by the Dyatlov Pass incident, but it does a really good job freaking you out even if it's over nothing. The first time I played last night, I kept freaking out that I would spontaniously combust, that's how bad this game can get you. It's not about Jump-Scares, and it's about the atmosphere which this title does extremely well. I'll be editing this review once I get further.","March 29","true","1.6"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Maybe It's just me because I was expecting ultimate horror experiance, and I didn't feel it here.\n\nOverall;\nHighly recommended for any horror fans.","April 10","true","4.4"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

However, this did not influence my review in any way.\n\nOk for now this is a placeholder review and i will be updating my experience after I've finished the game.\nAs from what ive played so far I'm liking it. Its very atmospheric to the extent that I've had to come off it, as I've got a hangover :-P\nCurrently playing on the oculus DK2 (1.3) with a 980ti and the game runs flawless and the graphics are nice.\nAs far as the VR you can't complain about the price point as other games have seemed to hiked there prices due to the VR bandwagon. So excelllent value for money and great to finally get to try a horror game in VR.\n","April 11","true","4.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

I'm currently 1 hour in!\n\nBefore I started playing Amigdala I was a little afraid that it would cater more to Oculus Rift players rather than those who don't have the equipment. I have to say - I love being wrong! Even if you don't have an Oculus Rift, this game is really scary. The atmosphere is amazing so far and the environments are really impressive to walk through - with or without the Oculus Rift. My only criticism of this game so far is that the voice narrating at the beginning of the game sounded a little too quiet at times - but it's also good because that definitely fits into the whole creepiness of the atmosphere, so I understand why it was done!\n\nThe monsters are REALLY creepy. While I was walking around, I saw a creature standing somewhere and I only noticed it once it moved away. What made it creepy was that I only noticed it when it moved, so it had been watching me the whole time. It's little details like this that will definitely make me remember this game once I've finished playing it. I'll add more to this review once I play more including videos once I have time to edit them!","April 18","true","4.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It has a very different vibe to it and even though it has vewry few if any jumpscares, i still think that it was an overall okay game. The graphics are pretty great and intensity is extreme. The only think that concerns me a little about this game is the story. I must say tyhat it is a little confusing at some points and i was kind of lost throught the game as there really is no sort of objectives, But overall i reccomend this game and it's worth a try.","April 17","true","4.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I tried a few runs and never made it very far due to bugs, freezing and obstacles that were difficult to move around. I will say from the start that I was playing with mouse and keyboard, while the dev recommends controller. I will re-review the game after I get my controller and try again.\n\nController or not, there are bugs and annoying things that ruin the immersion. Right at the beginning of the game, in order to got to the menu and save, you must stand directly in front of the onscreen instruction and press the appropriate button. If you pan the cam too much left, right, up, or down, the instruction will vanish. I do like the idea of onscreen instructions, but I felt in this case it was too finicky to be all that helpful. In addition, whenever you approach a door or item you can pick up, you get the onscreen instruction to do so. In this case, I dislike it. It is fine at the very beginning of the game, but later on there should be a better way to indicate which items can be interacted with. Constant text on the screen really destroys my immersion.\n\nAnother bug showed up when I picked up a note and could not put it down. All I could do was spin around, but could not walk or drop the note. I had to force-close the game. I also had multiple times where I had to close the gam because it would not load. I have a fairly decent PC, so I am not so sure that it is a problem on my end.\n\nBugs aside, there are good points about this game. It looks gorgeous; the graphics are amazing (Unreal Engine). The story (what I got through after the bugs) is great. I am a fan of conspiracy theories, so the story drew me to the game. I am impressed that one person researched the story and made this game on his own. I think with some bug fixes and playing again with a controller, this could be a very good game. I plan to come back after playing with the controller.","April 9","false","4.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"
