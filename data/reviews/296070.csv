Those visuals are fantastic. I really hope Carlos Coronado goes on to develop dozens of games.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nI hope he is never allowed to  have any say on the narrative aspects of his games. It boggles me that someone can have such great taste in design and still give the greenlight to such awful writing and voiceover work to accompany their game.  This is some of the worst writing I've experienced in a game. I want you to think about that for a moment, think of every ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cutscene you've seen, every dumb plotline. This game still manages to outdo them. How? Because it presents itself as awful poetry, then subverts itself  and it's plotine with cringworthy self reflection, then manages to return to the awful plotline and wrap it up in a way that offers no imagination or room for interpretation. You can't scream at your audience "this is what the story is!" after you've just screamed at them "aren't these metaphors stupid!?"\n\nIt was announced that this game is getting a re-write. Hopefully they fix this but the narrative is so ingrained into its design (which, oddly enough, is actually good design) that I can't imagine a rewrite saving it.\n\nUgh, how tragically disappointing.","October 25, 2014","false","4.4"," 190 of 252 people (75%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","75","190","252","14","5"

People’s minds, their inner torment, dreams, nightmares, thoughts and aspirations. So with that I imagine it’s pretty hard to put something so… deep, I guess? …Into a game, have it make sense and have the visuals live up to the vast imagination and expectation of others. All of which just kind of naturally come with the subject. I was pretty excited to try this because it really seemed from the trailer like they had all aspects, the visuals, the puzzles and the story, down to a tee.\n\nWell First off, the visuals are definitely what they seem. They are absolutely amazing. Although I was pretty gutted that for some reason Steam overlay wasn’t working for me with this game so no screenshots for me! There really is some amazing scenery in this game. I would actually go as far as to say this game is worth trying purely for that. But then again, not all people are as easily amused by how things look as I am.\n\nThe puzzle side to things were quite unclear from the trailer (maybe I just wasn’t paying attention) so I was a little unsure on what to expect. But I was actually pleasantly surprised by the mechanics when I played. They’re unique and if anything the mechanics for the puzzles actually enhance the visuals even more. You basically interact with “tumble weed” like balls, place them in various different “hotspots”, I guess, which change your surroundings. Each one doing something different, changing the scene in a particular way, you obviously needing to figure out how to manipulate the level into being able to move onward.\n\nNow here is the iffy part.\nA lot of reviews that I read before I started this game definitely mentioned the storyline/voice acting being the main problem. I went into the game not really expecting much because of it and to be honest maybe that is why I wasn’t as disappointed as others seemed to have been.\nThe voice acting is bearable through the most of it in my opinion, there was only one or two odd scenes which really were cringe-worthy to the point of giggling to myself like “REALLY?” despite it being a very serious and “emotional” scene.\nThe story on the other hand, to be fair, was a little poorly executed. You can… kiiind of? See what they were trying to do with it but it really could have been done better. The foundations for something great are there, but as it stands it is very “meh”.\n\nLastly, Achievements!\nThis game is a pretty easy one to 100%, there were a few I thought were going to be very tedious to try and get but it turns out they weren’t!\nApparently I have a total of 11 hours in this game, but honestly I think quite a lot of that is me standing around in the game hungover trying to solve puzzles (really wasn’t a good idea) and idling seeing as I wondered off a few times after being so stumped over one or two of the puzzles. So if a normal functioning human being wanted to 100% this I’m sure it’d be a lot less.\n\nAll in all though, during the playthrough I was very unsure the whole time, I didn’t really know what to think, had these negative reviews rattling around in my head lowering my expectations, but now I have finished it and I kind of sit and reflect a little, I still think this game is worth recommending. The story isn’t great but you can see what they are getting at. It’s not AMAZING, but it’s bearable.\n\n\nTL;DR : Amazing visuals, iffy but bearable story and unique puzzle mechanics. Despite having a bit of a “I don’t know about this” attitude throughout the whole thing, after finishing it and looking back I would still say it’s worth a try.","February 15, 2015","true","11.8"," 60 of 62 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","60","62","4","6"

However, the inconsistency is not in this manner but many other aspects instead.\n\nFirstly, the graphics of this game is inconsistent (both qualitatively and stylistically): I ran the game at maximum video setting, so around 40% of the levels look magnificently beautiful, which match the quality of the screenshots displayed here. However, the rest are a huge disappointment:  Poorly-rendered and lighted scenes, Low-res and repetitive textures, unapt color palette. Some levels really brought me back to the 90s, reminds me of the Myst somehow (the original 1993 version not the remastered version). Yes, I'm talking about those forest and lakeside levels.\n\nSecondly, the gameplay is inconsistent. Like most other psychological walking simulators out there, as if their developers aren't confident enought with their already-expressive (might as well be self-interpreting) works, always trying to make them more "playable" simply by adding out-of-place cheesy puzzles here and there. But to be honest, most of those puzzles are badly designed, and has nothing to do with neither narrative nor expression, which also pull you out of the immersion immediately.\nI am excessively into hardcore puzzle game and pure walking simulator (such as Dear Esther), but the compromised hybrid between them? I rarely seen any good one (such as Ether One, no pun intended),  and this game is definitely not one of them.\n\nLast and most importantly, the whole "flow" in this game is inconsistent. All scenes and levels are so "isolated", there isn't a sheer connection between level and level. Conceptually, aesthetically, logically, visually, they are isolated in every aspects. Of course, someone might argue that this game is all about a subconscious struggle, so it should be in this inconsistent way, which I'd like to debate.\n\nDesigning video game, especially artistic games like this one, is more like to format the design language in a proper and consistent manner, in order to "persuade" the audience to get into the author's shoes.\n\nHowever, with a shattered inconsistent language, this game is far from persuasive, but more like a rough patchwork putting together all scenes made in modelling practices from a long time span (considering the large disparity in quality), then sewed up with a improvised storyline.\n","January 5","false","8.3"," 67 of 75 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","67","75","3","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/296070/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3197 products in account","Path to Thalamus, hum. Here's a tricky one. I don't wish to spoiler the story beyond giving you the intro, because the story is well told (I'm about one third to one half way through at the point of writing by my estimate), and the VA is well produced. The graphics, save one or two low res textures are uniformly exceptional, in a few places you can practically hit "screenshot" and you've got yourself a 1920x1080 wallpaper, yes, they're that good. The mechanics are creative as well, I am a great fan of games that eschew combat in favour of exploratory solutions, and I feel that games as a medium to tell stories, particularly the story that's told here, are finally now coming of age. But it's not a game I can recommend without a couple of caveats, it's not going to appeal to all and sundry, to those who have looked at the store page and who think this is a game that might appeal to them, read on. To those who are expecting the next dudebro shooter, move along please, that's not what you'll be getting here.\n\nSo, to the meat of it - Mind: Path of Thalamus places you inside the head of someone who is currently in a coma, a man, a father, one who is buried deep in regret at the loss of his daughter (this is told in a very, very well played out intro scene which alludes to, but does not show the precise nature of it). Over time you'll learn this mans history, what drove him, what led him into the position that he's in, and now, deep in his unconsciousness, his path to redemption, the "Thalamus", represented by a great tree.\n\nThe depiction of the mind and the subconscious in this case is very, very well thought out, everything takes on a logical significance without descending too heavily into cliche (though occasionally the VA does make a point of lampshading the obvious dream and story cues), and the graphical fidelity means you get a very good sense of atmosphere. There's a pervading loneliness that is reminiscent of games like Gone Home and Dear Esther, but even moreso because you're trapped in your own mind with only your own voice to self narrate. If you've the machine and the graphics card for it, the game will reward you with some stunning landscapes and a visual atmosphere that is well worth the time invested.\n\nSound quality too, whilst it's not quite in the leagues of ambience as games such as Don't Starve or the seminal Endless Space, maintains a consistently high quality, and again, remains a good plus, the voice acting is decent, if not good most of the time, though once or twice when he lampshades the dream cues you will be thinking to yourself "Thank you Captain Obvious".\n\nGameplay revolves around exploration, which is handled very cleanly and with the visual landscapes, is a pleasure, and the puzzle design, and here's where I have to issue the caveat. The puzzle design at the point of writing is a little uneven, some of them are very well paced, and despite being tricky little beasts, once solved, give you that feeling of satisfaction that comes with beating a well crafted challenge. Others... just have you running around doing a lot of legwork, and that's partly a problem in the core design of how the puzzles function, which annoyingly seems to be a case of placing objects in areas to manipulate the environment appropriately. The well designed puzzles keep the object movement relatively short, but clever, whereas the ones involving legwork (there's a cave level which is a particularly horrid early example) just makes you think "there may have been a better way to do this". I'm unsure on this point, but the busywork does take the sheen off of what otherwise has been an excellent experience.\n\nBy now you will probably have a feeling if you know whether this will be a game that appeals to you or not, it's an exploratory game in the same sense Dear Esther and Gone Home was, and I feel the medium can only benefit from games like this, the puzzle design or perhaps the core mechanic of the objects should have been handled more elegantly, and some of the puzzles carry a risk of you ending up going around in circles, but to those willing to persist, and to those who enjoyed the experiences Dear Esther and Gone Home offered, this is a worthy follow up to those kinds of games.","August 3, 2014","true","2.0"," 109 of 140 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","109","140","0","1"

This game is a shining example of how far video games have come, and how artistic they can be. My only criticism of the game is that some puzzles drag out a little due to the player having to cover large distances. The slow movement pace is only annoying in a couple of challenges and for the most part moving through the beautiful environments was a pleasure. I think all critics of the games industry as a form of art need to play this game, as the experience is something that will stick with you long after the credits roll. Mind: Path to Thalamus is an amazing game, and has earned 9 out of 10 from me.\n\nSTORY\nI was hooked straight into the story during this powerful opening sequence, and with the game assuming that the player already knows how basic movement works, no time was wasted with needless on screen prompts, allowing for quick immersion. As the player continues to search for Sophia you are knocked unconscious, starting your journey through the inner workings of your mind, to the thalamus.\n\nThe game is minimalist with its on screen prompts, and with the purposefully basic controls I never felt that my progress was slowed due to a lack of explanation. I was having a great time, absorbing the story through the perfectly voice acted narration, while completing puzzles, when I suddenly realised I had just completed the tutorial phase of the game.\nThe player is led through each environment by the floating drawings of Sophia, with the protagonist weaving in explanations of mechanics and goals subtly in the narration. The game utilise a huge range of metaphors in the challenges and environment  as the main character narrates his way through his painful memories and experiences. I don't want to ruin the story of Mind: Path to Thalamus by giving away plot points, but I will say this game was extremely moving and I was genuinely affected by the story of the main character.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe puzzle mechanics used in Mind: Path to Thalamus, are basic when considered conceptually, but are displayed beautifully in the environments. Players need to activate various environmental changes by placing themselves or small tumbleweed like balls in specific locations to allow them access to the goal of the area. The different environmental changes vary from changing between day and night, controlling fog, causing rain and controlling time.\n\nEach environmental mechanic is introduced gradually keeping the puzzles fresh and challenging without overwhelming the player. I found myself stopping and taking in each puzzle mechanic when it is used, as the impact on the environment is breath taking. Players must also be careful not to run into the" trauma", which are black and red electrical balls, that represent the damage that has been done to the main character's brain. The puzzles in Mind: Path to Thalamus are perfectly paced and are never too easy, or too difficult, but still make the player think laterally about the environments.\n\nVISUALS\nThe visuals of Mind: Path to Thalamus are the focus of the game, and are absolutely beautiful. I was forever slow panning each area and enjoying all of the intricate beauty of the environments. There are heaps of subtle metaphors relating to the story of the main character, and the use of minimalist area design creates surreal beauty while facilitating the puzzle focus of the game. One area that I found particularly beautiful, and fantastically designed, had the player traversing ice paths. These represented the synapses of the brain, with the images of his memories reflected on the ice surface.\n\nMUSIC\nMind: Path to Thalamus continues its balance of minimalist design, with breath taking immersion, through the perfect use of sound and music. Many areas have no music at all with the sounds of the environment and the amazing voice acting of the narrator carrying the player perfectly. There were so many moments in this game when I would stop and listen to the rain drops splashing on the ground or enjoy the mystical wind blowing through the trees. During moments of beautiful environmental reveals or important character realisations, a gentle, but emotive piano score would resonate around the player, intensifying the situation. The piano score from Mind: Path to Thalamus is a beautiful piece of music, and I have found myself listening to it again and again since completing the game.\n\nFor my full review and heaps of other delicious content see Glitch[glitchnews.com.au]","October 15, 2014","true","6.8"," 47 of 52 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","47","52","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/296070/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Mind: Path to Thalamus is the emotional aftermath of a careless father, one who dragged his children on trips to chase storms and other extreme weather. It’s a personal crusade that ultimately enacts cascading consequences: a fatal tsunami which swept away the narrator’s sister as he watched from the safety of a tree, his father nowhere to be found. A descent into drunken madness as a result of a broken family and an inability to believe in the truth of a sibling’s death. The narrator blames his father, but also himself, as he too chases extreme weather: the opening scene of the game is a massive tornado in which you must find your own daughter, named prophetically after your sibling.And thus begins a decade-long coma through which Mind: Path to Thalamus is a journey. As you make your way to the heady metaphor that is a giant tree called Thalamus, the road is paved with obstacles in the form of weather/environment changing abilities. Special areas—marked by gnarled trees, lilies, cairns, or slowly rotating gears—affect fog, night/day, rain, and time, respectively. Stand in their areas—or leave a spindly ball of glowing neurons in them—and the fog will expand, the sun will set, rain will fall, or ruins destroyed by time will grow whole again. Mastering these will be the nuts and bolts of your journey, the tools that let you pass into new areas and build up, more like Portal than Myst.Each map is nothing short of breathtaking in its complete disregard for spatial logic: chairs sit with their legs against walls, neat rows ordered to the ceiling. Railroad tracks truncate into blinding tunnels. Decaying ruins grow from an endless, ankle-high sea which reflects invisible, walkable segments floating above you. As the hollow avatar of the game’s narrator, you hold down W to move across these mindscapes, explore inner turmoil, solve puzzles, and listen to a voiceover that elucidates regret, dead sisters, drunken fathers, and shame.It’s incredibly ambitious subject matter from a young creator, but at times, it falls somewhat flat. All of this information is delivered in voiceover that pops up at the beginning of levels, whenever you solve a part of a puzzle, and so on, often in ornamental language or via out-of-place references. Awkward, overly poetic phrases make the game feel like a high school, compounded by a young voice actor who has a hard time passing for a father, let alone one who has been ravaged by life and death.Saying the game is about exploration may be a little reductive but it’s also true. It wasn’t the allure of puzzle solving that drew me in Mind. It wasn’t the developing powers over night and day, fog, clarity, or even time that are used to solve them. These elements deepened the gameplay in a necessary enjoyable way, but my ‘path to thalamus’ was characterized by soaking in each of the game’s environments. Puzzle solving, as tricky and inventive as the puzzles often were, was a means to an end: they were the reason to slow down and notice all that was around me. And that is why I will remember Mind.Mind: Path to Thalamus would never have existed ten years ago. Its abstract, high-minded premise isn’t one we would have seen from a big publisher. Instead, a single man and his small band of compatriots deliver on one of the most creative ideas of recent years.Mind is beautiful and its surreal environments will linger on with me longer after the story has faded. Exploration is its defining quality, even as the puzzle solving elevates above other exploratory games. For this reason, Mind: Path to Thalamus is an easy recommendation, even if its story falls a little short. This is a game that should be experienced.","March 17, 2015","true","40.5"," 43 of 50 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","43","50","4","2"

Nothing was explained, though once you realize that every single puzzle is going to be "get a blue wired ball to a specific location or hit the mirror so you can proceed forward", it gets old very fast. Though the result of putting the ball in a specific location eventually varied visually, you were still essentially doing the same thing.\n\nI am not going to even start on the story. Read someone else's review for that. Long story short, it was rushed near the end, clumsy with its metaphors, and the narrative was painful.\n\nSimply put this game was okay.

Based on its influences, I'd be inclined to like 'Mind: Path to Thalamus,' but I found myself disappointed by the game.\n\nThe visuals and aesthetics are outstanding, and are easily the highlight of the game.  There are fantastic uses of color and atmospheric effects to create beautiful, evocative scenes.  Even the skyboxes are amazing.  Music is used sparingly, but it fits the mood well.  If anything, I'd have much preferred to hear more of a soundtrack.\n\nPuzzles in the game work by changing part of the environment, including rebuilding ruined structures to triggering a beautiful night effect that looks absolutely gorgeous.  The 'fog' option is the only one I did not like.  It rarely makes the puzzle more interesting, but instead makes it a chore to navigate the environment.  Generally speaking, the puzzles were fine, though nothing outstanding.  Pretty easy, but a few brain teasers here and there. The main method of intereacting with the different elements usually involves walking over a certain area or placing a special ball inside of it.  Given the distances that often must be traveled, it often felt tedious, and the hands-off method of interaction took away some of the satisfaction of puzzle solving.\n\nThe main problem the game faces is its writing and voice acting.  I feel a little bad criticizing this aspect, since it is clearly an earnest attempt to elevate the game as an artistic statement.  To be clear, the writing is cohesive and competent, but it's misdirected in several ways.  First, the protagonist's backstory comes off as increasingly fanciful, to the point where I found myself rolling my eyes whenever it was referenced.  Considering that the main game is awash in fantastical and unreal imagery, having some element of the story be grounded would have helped.  As it was, I struggled to get behind the incredibly unlucky disasters that befell the protagonist.\n\nSecond, the writing becomes increasingly self-referential and tries to subvert narrative tropes.  It's a big risk whenever a story does that, and it didn't pay off. In fact, it completely turned me off of the story.\n\nThird, the way the main character is personified relies on him 'telling' us how he feels and what he knows, not 'showing.' At one point, the text almost directly states: "and this is what happened next."  I didn't care for this approach. It gives too much away and made it more difficult to empathize with the protagonist.\n\nThe game's short length is another issue (much of my play time was spent idling).  I feel that a longer play time may have allowed the game to sink its teeth into me.  I think more subtle story telling technique may have also deepened my appreciation for the game.\n\nOverall, I was disappointed by Mind: Path to Thalamus.  It's not a bad game, not by any stretch, but it falls short creating a memorable story or puzzle experience, and in the absence of anything that truly stuck with me, I can't recommend the game. Yet I feel I must reiterate that there's nothing cheap or lazy about the game, esepcially its aesthetics.   I'd suggest readers of this review consider Ether One, a game that I think does a superior job in world building, restrained storytelling, and organic puzzle solving.","August 8, 2014","false","7.6"," 56 of 80 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","56","80","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cheesecake_Recipe/recommended/296070/","Cheesecake_Recipe","A Victim of Stars","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cheesecake_Recipe/","882 products in account","The mind is a beautiful, sometimes terrifying, thing. Projecting nightmares, anxiety, flashbacks to embarrassing moments we endured in our lives. In our day to day lives, we’re often able to draw attention away from such negative thoughts and musings with the distraction and hum of daily life. But when you’re trapped in your own head, and there’s nothing between you and the darkest corners of your thoughts, it can be a hell in which there’s no escaping. Sometimes, there’s nothing but a malfunction, a delayed chemical or electrical reaction in the body, that prevents us from leaving such a place. There’s little we truly understand about such conditions. Can one even fight their way back to the surface? Or is it totally down to chance?\n\nThe protagonist of Mind: Path to the Thalamus, only known by the name of Nick, is a prisoner in his own head. His struggle to reach the Thalamus, the part of the brain which controls consciousness, is gorgeously rendered by dreamy vistas inspired by dream art, surrealism, and the culture surrounding the formation of those movements. His internal struggle is a powerful, personal one. Threads of plot are entwined between his younger self dealing with the death of his sister Sophia, an abusive drunk of a father, and the loss of his daughter – whom, perhaps unwisely, he named after his deceased sister. His path to the sacred tree he crawls toward in a disjointed journey is riddled with visuals both symbolic and grounded in the reality of Nick’s past.\n\nPerfectly in tune with the dreamy nature of the visuals are the puzzles, which take advantage of the mind’s ability to transform a scene and abandon conventional logic. Each element of a puzzle is controlled by placing or removing a webbed orb from an environmental cue. Dropping an orb onto a field of glowing flowers will bring about the night. Dropping one near a circle of rocks, which leak water from an impossible source, causes thunder to roar from the sky and heavy rain to pour down. Each brings some fundamental change that you will need to learn in order to solve an area. With the exception of the very first concept, which is abandoned for good pretty much right after it is introduced, every one of the powers is gradually taught to you and then added in progressively more difficult puzzles featuring other powers.\n\nThe degree of cleverness varies wildly, from being brain dead easy to requiring some serious ‘outside of the box’ thinking. I’m no Mensa, so a softer approach to the puzzle elements kept me from feeling too frustrated. Unfortunately, this means those who were looking for higher level challenges will be let down. Even the most difficult of puzzles didn’t require more than a handful of tries before the solution would present itself. Even still, it’s fun to watch the leaves change color, or a night sky, complete with rain, to completely change the mood of a beautifully constructed scene.\n\nSome slight texture/detail pop-in marrs the otherwise gorgeous crafted scenery. For most maps, this isn’t an issue. Larger maps tend to have this effect rear its ugly head more often. It’s difficult to enjoy a wide shot of rolling hills when the texture on the hills displays its tiled texture until you’re a few feet from it. It’s only a small mark against the lush atmosphere achieved by the excellent use of color and texture to paint such striking imagery, but one that must be mentioned all the same.\n\nIf I were to have any major complaints, it would be directed towards the ever-present monologue provided by the protagonist. The entirety of the game’s story is told through musings and introspective questions. The problem here, I felt, was the lack of emotion and unnatural speech patterns used by the narrator. His inflection, and emphasis on certain words over others, sounds awkward and stilted, getting in the way of my ability to stay immersed in the game’s world. Everyone will have their opinion on how much they can tolerate the voice acting and, while a Spanish voice acting track has been promised to players since before launch, it has yet to surface in the game as of yet.\n\nPart of the reason this review has taken so long hasn’t been because I was in a coma myself but rather due to the constant state of flux the game’s script has been in. After launch, feedback was next to unanimous that the script was very weak. The developers took this to heart and removed a lot of the game’s superfluous ramblings. Many of the sarcastic remarks made by the protagonist were also removed, as were some of the faux-philosophical quandaries. Mood and tone were pretty much instantly improved but the differences still aren’t quite enough to remedy the incredibly stale delivery by the lead voice actor. If I’m to be completely honest, I think I’d need him to be replaced as well. But again, opinions differ and it may not be such an issue for you.\n\nMind: Path to Thalamus straddles a line between the artistic pursuits of games such as Dear Esther while tying its themes to puzzles that require thinking about things a different way, a la Echochrome or Antichamber. It’s a game with big ideas, and a gorgeous art direction, but simply cannot carry itself under the weight of some ever-present negatives. Much like a dream, however, parts are constantly shifting around. The developers are listening to feedback and actually acting upon it. And I hope they achieve the perfect balance to make the game shine, refining the way it speaks about the delicate topics it covers. In some moments, between the bitter sorrow and the picturesque backgrounds, I had small flashes of scenes from What Dreams May Come. That’s quite a feeling to achieve.\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

I've played for hours but this reflection is about a girl: this man's daughter. Thge whole game is a 'Puzzler', and a Great one too! I was taken by the total beauty of the game. It looks , sometimes, Photo-realistic. A very cool game for a good system. If you don't it's still very cool, and you'll be blown away by how beautiful it is. The puzzles are quite fequently merely being smart with what you know. Like "Vanishing of Ethan Carter", there's not a help menu. Exploring and checking your 'hunches' about what to do are the key because you build on what you've learned. All puzzles get harder. This game has very sophisticated puzzles, and they are Quite daunting,.. Like I said Remember what youve learned, maybe write it down..., like I did, because I intend to beat this sucker.\nDon't get your hopes too high. I see this game as a real time tested 'Work-of-Art", because it gets to you and the puzzles only make you want to find out more!!\nI was So 'tested' by the puzzles. They are completable, merely with what you've seen and done. It gets better It really does, but after the first few puzzles your learning curve, isn't so hard.

Mind: Path to Thalamus is the sort of game I hate having to review; ambitious, compelling, and filled with beautifully imaginative imagery and a narrative that tries to explore intelligent themes of guilt, parental neglect, and the possibility of an afterlife. It’s a game with great potential that executes itself with an abundant lack of skill and cohesion, that by the end is almost pitiable in how poorly the experience comes together.\n\nEntering a dreamlike world within your own head by way of a tornado induced coma, you inhabit the body (for lack of a better term) of a father drowning in a tidal wave of guilt at the death of his sister (and more recently, daughter), for which he holds himself wholly responsible. His last thread of hope is to make his way to the Tree of Thalamus, a sort of tree of life which is at the heart of this world that in some ways serves as a bridge to heaven, where he will find his sister and beg for her forgiveness.\n\nSimply typing out that synopsis has given me an even more obvious view  of how fundamentally flawed the narrative is right from the start. It consistently loses its own plot as it attempts to draw meaning out of its level designs, juxtaposing new emotional hurdles for your character to overcome while never giving any of them time to develop into anything but poorly conjured schlock, existing solely to attempt to impose some greater purpose to the narrative than the mediocre writing ever manages to do. It’s telling that at the end of the game, the developer very nearly acknowledges the absurdity of the plot, though in doing so essentially writes off everything which came before and creates even more issues which ultimately culminate in an ending that seems to have no idea whatsoever what it wants to say, wrapping itself up hastily and clumsily before it can cause further harm.\n\nI appreciate that Mind attempts to tell a story that wishes to touch upon lesser explored themes than we often see in games, but to do so requires a great deal of forethought and an author capable of crafting something meaningful which is simply not present here. Mind drowns itself in self pity and heavy handed theology, leaving an abundance of plot holes along the way as the lone voice actor reads off a poorly worded script with a consistently over the top or lack of inflection that is little more than an embarrassment.\n\nThe pacing also suffers due to convoluted and tedious nature of the game’s puzzles, which involves placing strange tumbleweed like balls within certain areas in order to change some aspect of the level, be it making day turn to night illuminating portals or causing crumbled pieces of the environment reappear. Its mechanics are never explained nor even highlighted in such a way as to make them apparent through their effects, leaving the player to meander about levels until they may stumble into the right area and realize the subsequent result.\n\nThese areas are often hidden or placed out of the way, with the camera often being positioned in such a way as to lead you off in the wrong direction, as if the developer wanted to make them as hard to find as possible. The solutions are typically simplistic in nature, but because of the complete lack of a prior explanation of how the game’s systems work, it can be incredibly tedious to solve them. I never felt accomplished by discovering how to do so, instead a feeling much closer to relief that I could finally move on.\n\nThey also serve to disrupt the otherwise gorgeous art design of the environment, inserting stagnant architecture that is used to provide consistency for the puzzles, but often feels out of place positioned on the changing landscapes you travel between over the course of the game. In such a visually imaginative world, having these moments when parts of it clash stands out even more aggressively and greatly weakens what is easily the most well crafted element of the game.\n\nThe opening of Mind is without a doubt its strongest moment. It relates a possibility of something incredible, an excellently executed scene of a tsunami emerging out of the sea, destroying the countryside in a terrific display of destruction and chaos as our character frantically searches for his daughter. It gives the impression of lofty ambition and great promise, but only the former ever showcases again, more often than not to illustrate the danger of biting off more than you can chew.","November 2, 2014","false","6.9"," 47 of 75 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","47","75","0","0"

Nearly all of the puzzles, are based off using a ball to cause create certain effects, such as accelerate time, or shift time-of-day, etc.   The places that you go to, are very open although there are boundaries to keep you from getting too far off track.  Being this open, you get to enjoy the visuals of the game, along with explore and find ways of solving various puzzles.\n\nGraphics/visuals:   I do not feel that I need to say anything here because just looking at the screenshots, and the trailer, should give you more than enough proof that the game is eye-candy and looks beautiful.  Now, the graphic controls are few and limited, but the amount of optimization in the game, is shocking.  Games like this when I max out, are usually smooth but have rough spots or hiccups every now and then, but even with max settings and vsync, I had liquid smooth performance with absolutely no lag at all.  In short, you can most likely play this game, with an older computer.\n\nSound/music:   Music, was fitting and relaxing.  Sound effects were fine, although some things could have had more effects like walking on water or sand.  The narrator's voice is fine IMO, but certain lines felt really forced, but aside from that, he did fine.\n\nEnjoyment:  I love these type of games that explore the mind and make a game that represent abstract things, so it was a blast.\n\n\nOther:  No cards and no word if there will.  There are many things they could use as cards, backgrounds, and emoticons, but who knows.  maybe in the future they will make some.\n\n\nAny questions?

The dissociative narrative also serves the purpose of this general image, whereby you quickly get grabbed by the intimacy and self-awareness of the story which is also something you rarely come by in games. There is a heartfelt feeling to the game, and the guilt-ridden, grief-struck man we play as is a fairly easy one to relate, in this (his) pandemonium of emotive manifestations. As we traverse the neural pathways, ganglia, creating new paths: new associative links of lost memories, trying to make sense of the traumas, or to yet again connect with the traumas of our past. Exploring happily, in hope of absolving the implied sin, in hope of atonement and enlightenment, we trod along in this maddeningly wonderful world of explicit and poignant beauty.\n\nThe puzzle design is in itself rather brilliant, apart from my success in “cheating” by my exhaustive attempts at jumping past, over and across different platforms which did not seem to be the correct way of doing things.\nThe gradual introduction of mechanics in different forms, which all – despite the narratives self-hatred and degradation – I considered to be excellent, and surprisingly not too jarring to a world that could suffer severely by the hand of clumsy or all too “game-like” mechanics. As you walk across these shattered memories – and in some situations – traverse that which used to be, or crawl around in the organically ribbed (from centuries of successive rivulets of water) cavernous holes, intestinal and damp; slimy – or flow through between the enormously beautiful skybox, implemented to perfection, and its reflection, on the ocean beneath – or the forests that change color from gleeful green to autumn's golden glow – you can't help to feel a sense of joy, to be in this world, experiencing it: first-hand.\n\nThe game in a sense, pertaining to level design and set-design, symbolize the disintegration of body and mind, which pertains to the vicissitude of the edifice of both mind and matter – memory and structure, network –, especially so with a contusion on the brain, and in how we perceive matter with this contusion; or perhaps not experience at all outside of our mind, such as with being comatose.\nWhat is might not be, but what we grab is tangible, and that is what we work with. . . that is what we have to work with. Any dubious thought, skepticism, will serve to progress us if what was once tangible – or perceived to be as such – turns out not to be. Only the shame and disdain one may feel towards oneself, may not be the progression we were looking for.\nSome puzzles seemed to be shining lights on a mosaic memory, lighting neural pathways with a mirror: a reflection, of the past or speculative pathfinding.\n\nThe game switches on you towards the end, and the player, thinking about the symbolic situations and models sprinkled throughout the game, get their speculations happily denounced in thinking any real purpose or profoundness could be found in this game, sounding like a developer gone mad, even thinking it was all an obvious, not-so-creative attempt at clever metaphors. Perhaps I didn't see the pretense in the game, that would warrant such a reaction, but with insecurity comes an aberrative self-awareness, and in the case of this game, it slightly lessened the impact of quiet reflection, that it, before this point, had on me.\n\nMind: Path to Thalamus. . . is pretty neat.\n\n\n*Apparently pretension was deliberate, which makes a lot of sense narrative-wise, and I now have egg on my face, I'll leave this abomination up for the sake of shameful regret.","September 22, 2014","true","3.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElusiveOne/recommended/296070/","ElusiveOne","ElusiveOne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElusiveOne/","71 products in account","In MIND: Path of Thalamus, you traverse loosely connected surreal landscapes in pursuit of a floating piece of paper, presumably a drawing from your lost daughter, while solving clever puzzles that require both observation and thought.\nThe ingenious puzzle logic demands scrutiny, such as spotting the reflections of invisible bridges in the water to reveal a hidden path. Unfortunately, this also translates into unintuitive navigation where you basically walk into the air after memorizing the concealed path.\n\nConsequently, the game made me feel queasy rather quickly. Only two other titles share that unsavory distinction in my 30+ years of gaming. Thankfully, maxing the FOV in the settings completely solved that issue in subsequent sittings.\n\nLater on you'll largely be playing with assorted balls of twine, leaving them in key areas to activate puzzle triggers that require a bit more thought and are fairly enjoyable to solve. These switches alter the environment in one of multiple ways that mainly affect where you can go, such as enabling portals or elevating platforms. Correctly sequence your steps to move on to the next level.\n\nClaiming to completely alter the environment oversells MIND's capabilities. The environment changes are purely aesthetic, and while that also works nicely as a game mechanic you never actually control anything in any significant measure. All states are binary.\n\nInconsistent visuals vary from pleasant to conventional, showcasing a few striking visual moments and beautiful vistas, with the majority of the better realized scenes prominently featured in marketing screenshots and the rest consisting mostly of uninspired segments that lack the polish of the main levels.\n\nSome parts were so purposefully dark you literally see nothing but blackness even when carrying a glowing ball of light. Disorienting much? Later on excessive fog effects will bury you so intensely you'll barely see anything ahead of a few meters.\n\nParcels of monologue are uncovered by staring at white particles long enough to produce short narrative elements, unconvincing in both writing and performance. This feels not unlike a collectible run and is a terrible, terrible way to deliver a story. More appropriately, the narrator should have conferred his thoughts directly and naturally, without forcing the player to hunt down the monologue particles.\n\nThe story line is hardly worth mentioning anyway, since it is not the main focus and is completely disconnected from the actual puzzle solving. You could play through the entire game without the voice and the experience would not be diminished one bit.\n\nOf note, the rarely heard but soothing piano is very pleasant and makes me wish music played a bigger role.\n\nInvisible walls prevent you from reaching seemingly accessible places. The game does not expect you to explore beyond its tightly constrained play areas. It allows you to jump but doesn't expect you to do it either.\n\nPausing the game resets your progress back to the previous checkpoint without warning. Menus as a whole are poorly handled. For instance all chapters are unlocked from the onset but they're nearly impossible to identity with their vague names. Pressing ESC doesn't just load a menu, it unexpectedly sends you back directly to the desktop.\n\nOftentimes the sound glitches off completely and the game turns silent (Alt-Tab out and back to fix this recurring problem). Turning the settings to Ultra worked fine in-game but resulted in inexplicably acute stuttering in the menus.\n\nThe "enhanced" edition completely robs you of the final action-oriented level, a sort of boss fight in complete contrast with the more contemplative mood that permeates throughout. I only know of its existence from watching online videos, from which it seems it delivered the core of answers regarding the story. It's easy to understand why the developer chose to cut this potentially nauseating portion of the game for the VR experience, but it still feels like a cheat to not be able to finally reach the tree you've been seeking the entire game.\n\nThe following epilogue is artistically unique and very interesting, ending the experience on a positive note.\n\nA secret level can be discovered by walking through an immaterial door. Completing it sends you back to the main menu instead of returning to the current chapter, with progress reset. Good job. In it, the developers make a statement with a single phrase pasted on rock cliffs: "Videogames are not art." Well, there's no arguing here.\n\nIt is disheartening to not recommend an indie product into which the developers obviously put a lot of heart, but this inconsistent game rarely elevates to what it aspires for very long. The adequate gameplay may not be for everyone but should appeal to those who like the genre, if they're willing to overlook its numerable inconsistencies.","May 12","false","4.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Very creative uses of the engine.\nThe naration is good, the monologue is decent. The puzzles are more subtle than puzzles you find in other games, sometimes it doesn't even feel like a puzzle but as part of the surreal world you are navigating through. The worlds just feel like a Salvador Dali painting, would call this art than most pieces I find in modern art galleries.\n\nThe cons about this game are technical though and it won't apply to most people playing this, this is just me being a privaliged nitpicker.\nThe resolution of the game only goes upto 1080p So if you have a screen with high res, 1200, 1440, 1600 or like me, 4k then you will get pixely images.\nThere is also no way to change the mouse sensitivity so people with larger screens that have to use a higher dpi on their mouse means it's too sensitive. I was getting headaches after all the fast jerky movements of the camera.\n\nLuckily these are easier to fix and the important stuff that makes the game is solid.

The aesthetics of Mind are glorious to the extreme, few games have had me so captivated merely by how they look, but Mind managed it on numerous occassions. Although this can be seen from the screenshots and videos, something which can less easily be brought across in such mediums is the story.\n\nAvoiding specifics regarding the story, the way in which the story is presented within the world, and the way in which game mechanics are narratively presented; are near perfect. Whether intentionally or unintentionally (I suspect the former), every element fits neatly inside a cohesive landscape which allows for, and stands up to, analysis of the pretentious sort: If you are prone to such things, I cannot reccomend this game more highly. Even simple positioning and landscape backdrop has been considered thoroughly to give a clear sense of where one is in the world, and assure a sense of progression, as well as maintaining a goal in clear view.\n\nMind is not a tremendously lengthy game, but I found the length to be entirely appropriate, clearly however, if under five hours of play time (making allowances for puzzle solving,) is not enough, then obviously that must be taken into consideration but I would not consider any of that time spent as 'padding'.\n\nI have not yet mentioned game mechanics yet much, not because they are inconsequential or substandard, but because they were not what shone through in my experience of the game. Make no mistake, this is an experience that could not have been provided sufficiently by any other medium. But my enjoyment of Mind came overwhelmingly from the destination, and the journey, not the means of travel, but as previously stated the puzzles themselves did not feel contrived.\n\nIf you are interested in games that ask for some level of analysis, or if you want a game that uses every element to help reinforce a core message, then absolutely buy this game.","October 4, 2014","true","9.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The puzzles rely on some basic rules in order to open gateways to the next state of mind. Some parts are more beautiful and relaxed while others are chaotic and jumbled.\n\nPuzzle solving relies mostly on using these neuron-looking spheres which, if placed in the right locations, can alter the state of the environment and/or time.

To begin, it is evident that you realize that there are two separate versions of the game. Therefore I split up this review to compare the two versions.\n\nOld MIND (UDK):\nPros:\n-	Narration throughout the game\n-	Gorgeous Scenery\n-	Different Puzzles\n-	Works\n-	Final Boss\nCons:\n-	Less Optimized\n-	Less Complete Ending\n\n“Enhanced” Edition (Unreal 4):\nPros:\n-	Optimized Better\n-	VR Support\n-	Different Puzzles\n-	Complete Story\nCons:\n-	Different Ending with no Boss\n-	Less than Gorgeous Scenery\n-	Buggy\n-	Narration Missing Lines and Narration is only found within “floating orbs”\n\nNow, I may be slightly off with my information I have of the Old MIND version as I only played through the Enhanced Edition and tried the Old MIND version for less than an hour. The gameplay is a First Person Puzzler and is very simple as it involves moving these “balls” around to various points to change some aspect of the environment. However, that’s the biggest barrier in this game. Moving the balls too fast will cause the ball to glitch out and launch into space. Now maybe that is within both versions, I am unaware if it is or not. The Enhanced Edition has only one broken puzzle that involves reflection. I was going to mention the story; however I probably missed some of the “floating orbs” and thus missed some of the story. From the music I heard, I wish there was more of it, as it very much suits the beautiful scenery of the game. I tried so hard to enjoy this game, and whenever I started to enjoy it, a ball would launch out of my hands into space. I would recommend this game, only if you play the Old MIND version which is available as a beta within the properties of the game.","May 25","true","6.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The game itself is a very interesting concept of one mans inner struggle of forgiveness, guilt and overly exerted thoughts. The story's good for people that deal with anxiety and for those who want a very intriguing surreal "Inception" like experience. I must warn though, even though the game itself is therapeudic and beautiful; it still had flaws. The flaws consisted in repetition, all though this a personal opinion, It is important for a game to maintain momentum. The game opens up very differently when compared to most games. Path of Thalamus has major transisitions that are surreal and mind blowing. As the game progressed, the puzzles became tiring. I had gained the full feeling of success after every intricate subliminal puzzle. I just grew disappointed to see that the game had not kept the pace of the incredible transitions in the begining. This definitely is a different take on puzzlers, which I respect... I just wish I could run after I would make a wrong attempt at a puzzle. For the price of the game, this has got so much! Most worthy of the 12.99$ price. As a scale of rating, I would give an 8-10.","August 19, 2014","true","6.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

Virtually every level consists of surreal, idyllic landscapes and I found myself wanting to simply explore them and postponing actual progress.\n\nI've also found the soundtrack to be excellent, matching the visuals perfectly with melancholic piano compositions during well chosen sequences. Ambience sound is present and it too helped in creating a believable, yet dream-like environment.\n\nGameplay-wise, there's not a lot to it. It employs minimalistic puzzles that become progressively more complicated as you progress in the game, but ultimately require, in my opinion, little thinking. There is no inventory; puzzles must be solved by interacting with the available objects in the area, which are very limited in number and variety, resulting in puzzles that never really change much. The game is also divided into levels instead of having a big world that can be traversed and backtracked at your leisure, and each level has a puzzle that must be overcome before you can reach the next one. There's very little exploration to be done, since the levels are either very straightforward or surrounded by quasi-invisible walls in case of the outdoor areas and are functionally simply not very large despite sometimes visually stretching into the distance. In the end, the game felt to me more like a pure puzzle one than an adventure one.\n\nWhen it comes to the story, it's also quite minimal and it's mostly presented via sporadic narration. Unfortunately, I felt the voiced narration actually detracted from the otherwise solitary and cryptic experience; I believe it would have been more interesting if the player was allowed to come to their own conclusions regarding the story, by investigating their surroundings, instead of being handed actual dialogue explaining what happened. That, of course, is purely personal preference.\n\nDespite being really short (clocking at around 4 hours) and not living up to my expectations as an adventure game, the atmosphere alone was worth the price of admission for me. The visuals and music are impeccable and I find myself wishing for more games able to deliver an experience like this. If you, too, are an enthusiast for atmosphere in games and are not exactly looking for a big contender in the adventure genre, I believe you'll really appreciate this game.","November 21, 2015","true","4.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

They had a great oppertunity to progressively tell the narrative throughout the game and unfold the mystery as you go along through showing rather than telling, but instead we just get a big narrator told exposition at the end that doesn't seem all that congruent or relavent to the rest of the game.\n\nAll in all, great game, but a missed opportunity on the story.\n\nStill would recommend it though.","November 5, 2015","true","3.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However, it probably leaves a bit too much to trial and error.  The story is fairly original, but ultimately fell flat for me.\n\nIt concerns a man who lost his daughter in a tsunami, who has since fallen into a coma.  He's trying to find his daughter in his own mind, and escape from his mental state by solving abstract puzzles in the (really quite beautiful) landscapes of his unconcious.  Interesting premise, however it's delivered entirely through poorly acted voiceover.  The game doesn't really explain much about the protagonist or his daughter (at least in the first half of the game, I didn't finish it), so we don't really have an incentive to care all that much about either of them.  So that really leaves the gameplay as the main drawcard.\n\nThere are some strong ideas when it comes to puzzles, however much of it fell flat due to the trial and error required to understand the basic mechanics.  I'll explain them, if you don't mind being mildly spoiled on the mechanics.  Essentially, there are areas on the ground that, when stood in, affect the level in various ways.  Patches of white flowers will change the level to night, which opens various portals around the area, and makes balls of light become visible.  Stone circles will bring on the rain, which raises certain wooden platforms.  Tree arches/circles will make the level foggy, but remove spherical barriers blocking paths.  These effects only apply while you're standing in the zones, so you'll need to place balls you find into them to change the states and solve the puzzles.  This also means that if you enter an area and it's already dark, you know there's a ball in a flower patch somewhere.  Once you've figured this out, the puzzle system becomes quite rewarding.  But the trial and error required to get to that point can be irritating.\n\nUltimately, I gave up on playing about halfway through because I wasn't having much fun with the puzzles, and the story wasn't compelling enough for me to continue.  There's definitely promise here though, and I'll be keeping an eye on future projects from this developer.","February 4, 2015","false","17.3"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

I've been wanting to try this one for a while, so when I saw it on sale, I bought it right away. The gameplay is approximately 4-5 hrs, so for a few bucks, it's well worth it. The trailer sucked me right in, but unfortunately, I wasn't as immersed into the 'Mind' as I thought I'd be... At first glance, the levels look spectacular. But then after walking around for a while, you realize that the level design is usually limited to a small boxed off area (delineated by a picket fence in the game) with invisible walls. All of the backgrounds are just static images, so no matter how long you stare at the gorgeous artful of the sky, there's nothing dynamic about it at all. Some of the puzzles are very clever (I definitely encountered a few head scratchers), but most of them feel a tedious for no reason. The story is also quite confusing, and any in-game 'NPCs' look and feel like they were copied straight from an N64 game. It's too bad because this game had so much going for it, but the static environments, tedious puzzles, rigid characters, and confusing story made it really difficult to fully immerse myself in what the game developers had to offer.

It may not appeal to everyone, but those who enjoy this type of game will find it worth their while, even if it is only a short while.\n\nAs you can probably tell, this game has a strong narrative.  The story is well constructed, and is told very well.  It's not a groundbreaker, but it's easy to care about the character and his struggle.\n\nGameplay-wise, this is a little mixed.  I definitely enjoyed it, though some of the puzzles could be frustrating.  Fairly often I found myself concentrating so hard on the puzzles, especially later in the game, that I had to consciously step back and take in the visuals and atmosphere.  This isn't necessarily good nor bad overall, but I personally would have preferred a little more journey and exploration, and a little less puzzle.  Nothing wrong with puzzles, but the game becomes fairly well saturated with them before long.  Also, when you're carrying things, which is often, they take up most of the screen, blocking out much of the breathtaking visuals.\n\nWhen navigating the terrain, you'll often collide for no apparent reason, but it's not so bad that it ruins anything.  You're always able to get to where you're going.\n\nAll in all, I had fun playing the game.  Some may complain about how short it is, but I find the older I get, the less time I have to sit and complete something.  So these shorter games are very welcome additions to my library.

I felt punished, redeemed, guilty, responsible, attached, and devoid of what he was trying to accomplish and/or escape from. It's one of the few puzzle games where the narrative is as compelling and rewarding as the puzzles themselves. Benefits greatly from a willingness to listen and empathise, so definitely play with the sound on. The environments are colorful and varied, and the last few levels in particular are "stop and look at the skybox" beautiful.\n\nIt's only a few hours long, and not overly difficult, so you shouldn't worry about not being able to reach the end.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/castorquinn/recommended/296070/","castorquinn","castorquinn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/castorquinn/","380 products in account","In Brief\nMind: Path to Thalamus is a flawed walk-'em-up with puzzle elements, but it is so, so very pretty that it is worth playing on that basis alone.\n\nMost valuable resource: The art.  Oh my heavens the art.  Mind is the most artistically beautiful game I've ever played.\nOf interest to: people who enjoyed Dear Esther and Myst.\n\nWhat a conflicting game.  Mind brings to mind first and foremost Dear Esther.  Both are tales of a man exploring the concept of loss through imagery and an internal journey across a landscape painted in his own memories.  However there is just as strong a link to Myst: an adventure game where progress is driven by puzzle solving, but where primacy is given to the stunning backgrounds and fantastic, surreal locations through which you find yourself traveling.  The couple of moments of full video integration into the game (which is done supremely well and to great effect) really do evoke the groundbreaking work of the Millers.\n\nBefore I mention the flaws in this game - and boy are there some whomping great big flaws - I want to call attention to the visuals.  The quality of the art in this game is exceptional.  The whole artistic theme of the game, throughout all the puzzles, all the narrative sequences, right up to the closing credits, is faultless.  Every single part of the world is composed expertly in all directions, including the sky above and the ground beneath your feet (and sometimes also the sky beneath your feet).  If you completely excised the story, the art alone would make for a worthy experience, like walking slowly through a surrealist art exhibition.  I took so many screenshots while playing that I felt like a tourist taking happy snaps.  If they release a big glossy coffee table book of the art from this game I would pay real money for it.  If you're a pixel ♥♥♥♥♥ who gets off on stunning, striking, truly gorgeous art, this game is worth the entry fee on that basis alone.\n\nHowever - and this is a big however - there are several serious flaws with this game which take away from the experience in very significant ways.  As with my review of The Moon Sliver, another worthy but flawed narrative game, I hope that by preparing you for those flaws in advance they will not reduce your enjoyment of the game to the degree they did mine.\n\nThe first issue is purely one of game design.  The puzzles in this game revolve around moving these gorgeous glowing woven wicker spheres to different places on the map, and about a third of the time you're in the game (or more if you find the puzzles a struggle involving a lot of trial and error, as I did) you'll be carrying one of these spheres, and when you pick one up it fills the centre of the screen, making it hard or sometimes impossible to see what's right in front of you.  In a game as strongly visual as this (and one with so many bottomless holes in the terrain), the decision to give the player what amounts to cataracts for a good portion of the time is a terrible, terrible one.\n\nThe second major issue is the story, or rather the telling of it.  Without any spoilers, the premise is so incredibly familiar that within the first two scenes of the game you will believe you know the entire plot, and you will be correct.  I'll compare it to Dear Esther again because that's just the most applicable benchmark game when it comes to this type of storytelling.  In Dear Esther the whole game is a blur of the real and the imaginary, you're never sure whether the protagonist is projecting onto his environment or experiencing fantastic elements in his own mind.  Even at the very conclusion of that game those questions are never really answered; it is up to you, the player, to consider the narrative and interpret what you have just experienced and to arrive at an understanding of the game yourself.  The story is masterfully constructed, and respects the old writer's adage that it is better to show than to tell.\n\nThe writers of Mind: Path to Thalamus set up some imagery that is intended to communicate the bigger themes and questions to the player, but then they convey it all so heavy-handedly that they practically bludgeon you over the head with it.  The biggest spoiler you will ever read for this game is the title of the game itself.  There is a sequence towards the end of the game where all the imagery up to that point is literally explained to you - they have a voice-over sequence that literally lists the metaphors you've encountered and tells you what each one meant.  It is atrocious.  In a game that is visually so subtle and well composed it causes me actual pain to see the story - whose premise is not original but is certainly not bad, and is certainly worth exploring - butchered so bluntly.  Either the authors were so keen that their lovingly-crafted narrative be understood that they could not help but explain it, or they lacked confidence in their writing and over-compensated, or they thought so little of their audience that they felt they needed to be spoon-fed.  I charitably hope it's the former; I hope it's not a case of an auteur game designer too wrapped up in himself to allow the players to control their own experience of his artistic creation lest they experience it wrong.  Whatever the medium, good artistic narrative flows naturally; if you need to put it on rails, you've not crafted the narrative well enough.\n\nAlthough all credit to the developers for the way they handled the release; it has to be noted that when community feedback suggested the story was a bit pretentious, and "too wanky", they responded to the critique like true professionals, took that information on board, and deployed changes to the game when there really was no expectation that they would, or should, so they deserve props for that.  For such a new, loose collective they managed such an ambitious project, and its release, impeccably.\n\nHowever putting those two concerns aside, the game is a perfect length and is technically without problems (except for a little screen tearing I couldn't resolve), the puzzles have a gentle gradient that offers a fairly unique challenge that is the perfect mix of simple mechanics guided by logical, deductive reasoning, and as much as the conclusion of the story is mishandled, the final scenes in the game are visually and in terms of gameplay truly epic.  Get Mind: Path to Thalamus to experience walking through a gorgeously detailed, artistically flawless, stunningly beautiful surreal landscape, while dealing with organic, natural, thoughtful puzzles.  If you prepare yourself for the issues with the narrative you will be able to put that aside and just enjoy what is - and I can't use this word enough - the most artistically gorgeous game I've played.\n\nSupport this game and these developers; even though Mind: Path to Thalamus is flawed, it is still a great game, highly recommended, and the sort of game we need more of.","November 10, 2014","true","10.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's rare to see a game that can make a flat map look so good! I DID notice some disconnected models and floating rocks (not intended), but the artistic direction drowns out these minor flaws.\n+++The variance in the environment is what really steals the show! You'll start in a town being hit by a tornado, be warped to the Land of Oz with an endless beach, deep caves, expansive fields, floating islands, dense forests, ruins of ice and more!\n+Puzzles in the game are decent, but easy. Some take a bit of thought, but you should be able to get through it without resorting to a walkthrough.\n+The Music from the trailer is all you'll hear in the game and it's a very nice piece which fits perfectly! I wish it played more than 2-3 times though. The music is sprinkled throughout the game quite elegantly, but most of the time it's silent. It would have been much more enjoyable with a proper soundtrack though.\n\nTHE BAD:\n(-10)\n---The story is pretty bad. I tried to give it a chance, I really did, but it's the usual "Main character has issues. That's deep!" plot you see in most artsy games. Without spoiling anything, the story throws around basic psychology and acts like it pulled a fast one on you with it's "plot twist".\n---The main character sucks and you want him to lose by the end of the game.\nIf only the same amount of care spent on the game world went into the story, this could have really been something special.. instead you're attacked by an annoying voice with fluctuating audio levels that are either too quiet, or so loud they clip the mic. Let me be clear that I don't have a problem with the voice itself, it's the acting. It's no where near the level this game deserved.\n--The final confrontation (which is a pretty cool scene actually, but it's negative is worth mentioning) has the last boss swearing at you and telling you how useless you are while you try and solve the puzzle to beat him.. cool? His audio even repeats once he reaches the end of the script, resulting in an endless loop until "you win".\n-Walking is too slow for some of the larger environments, especially since some puzzles require backtracking.\n-This is just a minor complaint, but I found a few of the puzzles cheap.. hiding the required item in a body of water or tall grass where you literally cannot see it isn't a difficult puzzle, it's dumb luck.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nThe story constantly trying to force itself to the forefront gets tiresome and feels more like a personal agenda than an actual plot, but if you're willing to accept it and move on, the game world is worth experiencing. Don't be mistaken though, the world is linear.\nIgnoring the story, gameplay only suffers from a few abrasive puzzles, otherwise it's executed extremely well. The game lasts about 3 hours which felt perfect! Not too short that you feel cheated, while not so long you don't finish it.\n\nPlot or not, this is a rare case where the rest of the game is so tight that it's worth getting anyways!\nIf you're looking for a puzzle game with an imaginative world; get Path to Thalamus. It's right up there with games like Anna or The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, but if you're expecting a beautiful story to go along with it; search elsewhere.\n\n=Thank you for taking the time to read this review. I hope you found it helpful!\nPlease excuse my harshness towards the story! You have to play the game to understand how awkward it is.","January 4, 2015","true","3.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Stunning visuals and clever (if convoluted at times) Portal style puzzles, go for it; a strong story and really smooth gameplay, ehhhh.\n\nPersonally I'm really big on surreal surroundings and really enjoyed wandering the environments.  Invisible walls don't really curb the appeal of the seemingly endless plains and mirror-still water and misty depths, and compared to the past versions that I've seen mostly in Let's Plays the enhanced version of the game has really pared down and tightened up some of the puzzles so they're not as meandering.  It's all a very dreamlike ambience, and satisfying to solve and progress, especially as you move with a kind of surreal logic through environments that get hinted at ahead of you.  Plus the whole tone can change on a dime when you alter the environment with one of the puzzle elements; every one of them cause dramatic changes that fit in with the timeless nature of the place.  They're not kidding with that trailer, and every screenshot makes a desktop background.\n\nMy biggest gripe is with the narration, not because it's bad (though in later stages of the game it is), but actually because I wanted to hear more of it.  Yeah it's melodramatic, but the way the main character thinks is interesting.  I'm not sure what's wrong but it seems like a lot of it doesn't load in, and the enhanced version made a lot of it optional so you have to specifically trigger narration bits by getting close to these clusters of lights.  If you don't happen to notice them, you're kind of screwed.  I literally didn't even understand until I saw a let's play with more dialogue that there were two characters in the game with the same name, because none of the context that would tell me that loaded in, and so it got extremely confusing.  Also, the audio can be frustrating; the rain is satisfyingly loud, but if you trigger narration while it's raining, welp.\n\nOn the same note, several noises in the game are just unreasonably loud, considering how comparatively soft the narration is.  The worst offender was on top of this crystalline blue path in a dark blue void, just after a white portal.  These strikingly loud cracks started up and didn't stop and nearly gave me a heart attack.  I know it wasn't just me because I saw LPers react that way too.  And while I really enjoyed the puzzles, the game's been bugging on me here and there since the enhanced version, which is I assume some kinks that'll get worked out over time.  Relaunching is annoying but that's cleared it up so far.\n\nSo ultimately I kinda wish the sound mixing were better and there were a way to turn off the narration, because the draw for me is primarily in the visuals and ambiance and having some basic goals as an excuse to traverse the beautiful levels.  I was disappointed in the story in the end, but considering I would have been roughly as happy without one, not a dealbreaker.  (It was at least interesting enough in concept for me to pursue finding out as much about it as I could, clearly.)  And the puzzles sound like they may be a bit of an acquired taste that I happen to have.\n\nI recommend it if the thought of navigating precariously fragmented forests over a sheer void and wandering into dense fog after glowing portals simultaneously fascinates and terrifies you.","April 6","true","11.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They get steadily more tricky, and will have you thinking how to solve them for a few minutes (at least). The "four mirrors" in the desert, especially, were just gorgeous. Art in puzzle form, elegant, confusing, mind twisting. (but not at all frustrating)\n\nThe puzzles though, are not in every level. Sure you have to "solve" a few levels, but mostly they're rather pathetic puzzles of the form "find the ball". About 1/5 of the levels are good puzzles, the rest are walking simulator/find the ball.\n\nArt varies in a similar way. Some of the levels will take your breath away - espcially on load, when the "viewpoint" is so perfectly chosen it could be a painting. The other levels are interesting/pretty, but not in the same league. Once again, it's a mixture, some of the levels look superb, some are boring. I'd maybe say half-half here, so more consistent art than puzzles.\n\nLevel-character interaction is probably the weakest part of the game. Some points have you walking excessively long boring tunnels or grasslands for no real benefit, or "exploring" fog because you chanced to miss a fog ball. These long dry patches detracted and "bordered on boredom" at times.\n\nMusic is passable, narration is... weird. It's an intersting story (kind of cliche but it works, and that's ok), and it ties things together... a bit. Come for the puzzles and the occasionally breathtaking artwork.\n\nIn summary, the game is partly superb, and partly dull. If you can gloss over the dull parts (and make no mistake, they're not bad - just boring), you'll be left with excellent memories of pretty environments and aha-moment puzzle solving.\n\n[Oh, and this isn't a walking simulator. It's certainly a puzzle game (too). Gone Home has a better story but zero puzzle solving. It has some things in common with AntiChamber, and almost nothing in common with Stanley Parable]","January 15, 2015","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But is it really so? Let's find out.\n\nThe game follows the psychological journey of a comatose man through his own mind to reach conciousness. You will visit strange landscapes where you will be required to solve puzzles to advance. As you solve them, the man itself will reveal glimpses of what happened. Decent yet predictable story and good voice acting. No complains on this point.\n\nLet's move on to gameplay mechanics. You are suposed to change the weather to solve the puzzles, and you do it by placing yourself or some balls you will find in certain easily identifiable places. The way it helps you follows some weird logic, but a logic after all, and considering the setting of the game, this is not necessary a bad thing. I mean that the efects of the elements you control are not what you would expect. For example, fog removes some barriers, and night reveals some objects and activates teleportation gateways.\n\nIn the end, the puzzles are reduced to find the balls and place them in the right order. In my opinion, this oversimplifies the game. I would have prefered that they came up with a more elaborated way of controling the environment. Another problem I see here is that the puzzles don't start to get hard until almost the end of the game.\n\nOn the audiovisual aspect, I cannot but praise the developers. The game is really beatiful, the landscapes are well designed (although some better than others), and the atmospheric sounds get you into the game.\n\nIn conclusion, I would say Mind: Path to Thalamus is a good game, with awesome ideas but with a gameplay not implemented in the best way. It is still fun to walk around and solve the puzzles (especially the last ones), but considering the duration (around 4 hours), my opinion is that the price is not worth the experience. I'm giving thumbs up because I enjoyed the game, but having payed 3€, not 13€. If you like first person puzzles, this is a quite good one, and I recommend it if it goes on sale. At full price, think twice.","January 9, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

He wanders a surreal place in search of the thalamus reminding me of Dali, Myst or Inception at times.\n\nGameplay:\nYou walk at a rather slow pace through a pretty landscape and solve easy-medium puzzles (never took me more than 15 minutes on one) where you basically drop balls on switches that change day to night or sun to rain and so on. Some balls only appear at night, some bridges can only be crossed by rain and balls roll down when placed on a slope etc.\nI estimate the game takes around three hours to finish.\n\nExecution:\nThe visual presentation looks gorgeous though in detail the foliage on the trees is somewhat flat. Piano music is serene and fits very well. Script and voiceover have been criticised by others - I think it's decent, he's in coma after all.\n\nThe puzzle elements and the surreal setting sets the game appart from simple walking simulators like "Dear Esther" (which bored me terribly).

I even like this game's moderate length (hate long and open world games). The theological themes were worrying in the beginning (I'm an atheist), but, at least imho, all turned out well in the end, just as expected. Overall, this is the game that you can show to your friend who hates all computer games and thinks they're for infantile imbeciles only.\n\nYes, it is far from perfect. Yes, the flow does get broken in places, because you're just not used to this kind of puzzles (and there's one super irritating jump to make). But as a surreal first person puzzlers go, it is brilliant. I fully expect it to be surpassed pretty soon though, as every other genre-first was surpassed in its time. And it is great! First person gaming was becoming too stagnant, too predictable, too dumb, but with games like this one it's getting exciting again.","November 23, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(and if player makes the right moves then the dissapearance of fog results in a awe inspiring moment)\n\nLow price though and gorgeous graphics and mostly good gameplay puts it from negative to a positive but with some caveats.

My Win 8.1 is now fully up-to-date, protected as best MS can offer and double-proofed against Win 10 spam.\nThe game itself is ok but not extraordinary – interesting landscapes, sort of original puzzles, ok-ish sound and average graphics. It has a story, not particularly deep, but better than some Hollywood movies nowadays. Pretty impressive for a game developed by 3 people, who still check the discussion boards and seem to be doing their best to fix the bugs. More than can be said for most AAA titles.\nAll in all, I found the installation process more engaging and offering a broader range of emotions.

The voice acting is poor, the story is bland and contrite, and the puzzles are largely trial-and-error.\n\nSomething that annoyed me was the evil-looking red shadow people, which we're led to believe are personifications of something dark within the protagonists mind, likely trauma from the events which unfold.\n\nThis is one of those moments where Dream shines; Dream shows the darker elements of the protagonists psyche with symbolic and clever imagery, all based on dream theory. Things like mannequins and mazes, things with meaning.\n\nIn Mind, however, the shadow people are just cut-and-paste representations of blanket "darkness" or "evil".\n\nIn short, I feel that, so far, Mind is a real let-down, which is a shame because it has buckets of potential and some really stunning environments.\n\nTo summarise, Mind is a game designed by a team of artists.

If you like art and don't mind spending hours just listening to footsteps and the occasional, occasional cryptic narration, then you may like this. Other than that, though, I would not recommend.\n\nJust before I start laying down sick burns and making this game feel all bad, I want to say: the art is brilliant.\nIt looks fantastic, and under any other circumstances, this could be a solid 9- 9.5/10. The puzzles are interesting, and the story seems like it could be good. BUT...\nThe game is cold-molasses slow, and gives you very (very, very, very) few choices as to how you want to play. The whole thing is, and I hate to use the overused, dead-horse beating cliche, but it really is "walking simulator 2014." Which is not a bad thing necessarily but if you want to hear the plot segments over a shorter interval than about every 10-15 minutes, and you like not having cramps in your middle finger from pressing w so much, this game is not really for you. The other massive complaint I have, which I already mentioned, is that there is NO CHOICE WHATSOEVER. I saw at the very beginning that there was the red path and the white path, when you're floating in blackness or whatever, and I took the white path without first checking red, but I strongly suspect it would have been locked anyway. Other than that, I have found absolutely zero branches in the path since then. If you walk too far from the path even, it isn't even disguised. there's just a fence. right there. can't jump over it, can't go around. go the wrong way down the tunnel, and then poof, not ten steps and there's a boulder just sitting there. It's just walk, walk, walk, solve a puzzle, flip a mirror, walk, walk, locomote, solve another puzzle, drop a tumbleweed, then walk, walk, and walk some frickin' more! It gets tiresime after a while.\nThis is really a brilliant artist, though, and with a bit of work on the annoyingly vast expanses of terrain and linear plot, it would be amazing.

The puzzle system, which is the core of the game, isn't really flawed itself. It may not be introduced the best way possible, but it still is a decent and original idea, and the mechanics are well explored throughout the game. What bugged me the most is how slow and tiring solving the puzzles felt. Yes, the vast and exquisit landscape is awesome, but having to walk across it back and forth trying to solve a puzzle is not fun.

The graphics are gorgeous, love the skyboxes, wide landscapes and emptiness of the world. But graphics are unfortunately the only thing I can be truely enthusiastic about. The puzzles are often, even in its short playtime, extremely frustrating and require way too much walking around aimlessly wishing you could move quicker and just trying random configurations until it works. They often don't feel very satisfying or at all tied in with the story either.\n\nThe story itself is... unimpressive, to say the least. I'm not sure how to describe the funny feeling I got. It was like they tried to make something very deep and metaphoric half of the time, and just said ♥♥♥♥ it the other half, making it feel very disjointed and pretentious. And ugh... the voiceovers... Especially at the end the voiceovers ruin any sense of immersion into the story with a seemingly bombastic "boss fight" that tries oh so hard to be epic but just made me sit in wonder what the hell they tried to do. The vague and unconvincing narrative makes it very difficult to get immersed with the character. Never have I actually felt "sorry" the problems he faces.\n\nThe ending is apparently supposed to explain that the game is satirical to other "pretentious" games like Portal that also have very vague narrative, but it's done very unconvincingly: Nowhere else is this sentiment obvious than some voice overs there, making it almost seem like the developers realized how weak some of their writing was that they decided a day before release to just call it satire, giving it a real "holier than thou" feel.\n\nBuy it if you love weird, curious environments and great graphics, and can put up with sometimes frustrating puzzles and mediocre narrative or if you are a game designer (it does some interesting things you can learn from), otherwise I can't really recommend it.\n\nI'm feeling a light 6","January 10, 2015","false","4.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sometimes they were frustrating because they were unclear. Sometimes they were frustrating because they took more work executing than figuring out. Sometimes they were about running everywhere in a huge map hunting for something, and next trying to find your way back in dense fog. Sometimes they were about putting something somewhere and then running to another location before you run out of time.\n\nThat being said, the puzzle elements do some really amazing meshing with the graphics/atmosphere, and other games could stand to learn from Mind:PathToThalamus's clever designs in that regard.\nTo spend more time harping on the graphics: Of the fourteen-or-so locations, I have vivid recollections of every one. the variety was staggering, and my favor ranges from merely "pretty" to "some of the most gorgeous landscapes I have ever been in in a game." I was able to run it decently on an older computer as well.\n\nThe pacing in the game was alright, but the random difficulty spikes were not welcome, and didn't add enough to the game to justify themselves.\n\nNeither was the plot worth including. Honestly, the plot managed to detract from the game more than it added, and I don't think that I am being unfair.\nI found it amusing at times, nicely mellow at others, but overall bland and distracting from the other parts which the games does far better. Some people find it overly obtuse and annoyingly philosophical. Others find it obnoxious, hollow inside, with nothing really to say except to try and be clever for lack of something better to do.\nThe developers listened to the public and adjusted the script since I played it. I liked the game enough to try and replay it to see what they had fixed, but the game crashed repeatedly (.... ..... .... ...) in one area, so I wasn't able to get past it to appreciate their upgrades. They can't have really fixed the plot drastically, unfortunately. I know so because: 1) it lacked depth to begin with 2) they were removing dialogue, not adding last I heard 3) some critical parts of the game depend on whatever remains of the plot they started with.\n\nSo yeah.\nPlay it for the graphics, atmosphere, imagination, and vastness of scale. Love it for that.\nEnjoy witnessing the (limited) way you can change the world,\nbut don't expect to interact much mechanics-wise\nor mind-wise.\n\nSimilar games:\nNaissanceE, (similar in puzzle worth, similar in atmosphere impact, similar in plot worth, more platforming difficulty, different surrealism style)\nKairo, (slightly better puzzles, worse graphics, different surrealism style)\nThe Path (slightly better plot but more "poetic," worse graphics, lack of puzzles)\n\nBetter games:\nDear Esther (lack of puzzles, better plot, similar striking environments worth, stronger atmosphere, deeper meaning/experience)\nJourney (better/less puzzles, better plot, similar striking environments worth, stronger atmosphere, deeper meaning/experience)\nThe Void (Extremely tough mechanics to master, slightly worse visuals, stronger atmosphere, deeper meaning/experience, less fun (a lot less fun) )","September 4, 2015","false","14.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Occasionally, you'll need to roll a ball down a hill so that it'll enter a slot after a certain delay, giving you time to get past an obstacle. At other times, you'll need to consider the interaction between the different effects slots have on the world--putting a ball in slot 1 will get you a second ball to put in slot 2, but it'll also raise a barrier; removing the ball from slot 1 again will remove the barrier, but also make the ball in slot 2 disappear. That sort of thing. There are a handful of interesting puzzles in the game. Unfortunately, there's a tremendous amount of tedious trudging you need to go through to get to these puzzles, and the world just doesn't sustain interest long enough to justify that. The environments are pretty enough, but really only when you first see them, because there's no variation within the environments to give you a sense of progress, apart from the various ball-and-slot macguffins scattered around. What seems initially like a lovely hilly meadow quickly becomes the frustratingly enormous meadow where you keep getting stuck on tiny bumps in the terrain, which makes you drop the ferschlugginger ball again.\n\nDropping the ball is a pretty major issue in this game. It's really easy to accidentally lose your grip on a ball. You don't lose much progress when this happens (if any), but it gets tiresome quickly. You'll drop the ball when it gets caught on terrain, and you'll also drop the ball when you run into one of the myriad invisible walls. This is particularly frustrating, since you pick up the ball by walking into it, so if you walk into an invisible wall and that makes it drop, it drops right next to the wall, so when you walk into it again to try to pick it up, you'll often just walk straight into the invisible wall again and drop the stupid thing. Having your puzzle-solving interrupted with sessions just wrestling the collision detection is not fun.\n\nThe game also insists on bludgeoning you with a terrible story. The plot, and I'm not making this up, runs like this: Father is a storm chaser. He takes the protagonist and his sister Sophia with him to pursue storms; Sophia drowns in a tsunami as a result. Protagonist never forgives his father for this, and expresses this by...becoming a storm chaser, and naming his own daughter Sophia. I think that's enough right there to give you a sense of the quality of the writing involved. It does not improve.\n\nDefinitely not recommended, unless you thought Dear Esther's story was terrific, but needed puzzles, and also thought the best puzzles in Portal 2 were the ones designed by Wheatley.","June 25, 2015","false","3.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I love these strange, artistic, narrative explorations but I have to be honest and say, for me, Mind: Path to Thalamus was disappointing.\n\nI found myself constantly comparing Mind to Dream, another game along similar lines, and in comparison I found Mind wanting. The voice acting is poor, the story is bland and contrite, and the puzzles are largely trial-and-error.\n\nSomething that annoyed me was the evil-looking red shadow people, which we're led to believe are personifications of something dark within the protagonists mind, likely trauma from the events which unfold.\n\nThis is one of those moments where Dream shines; Dream shows the darker elements of the protagonists psyche with symbolic and clever imagery, all based on dream theory. Things like mannequins and mazes, things with meaning.\n\nIn Mind, however, the shadow people are just cut-and-paste representations of blanket "darkness" or "evil".\n\nIn short, I feel that, so far, Mind is a real let-down, which is a shame because it has buckets of potential and some really stunning environments.\n\nTo summarise, Mind is a game designed by a team of artists. Dream is a game designed by a varied team, and the end result shows great superiority to this.","December 18, 2014","false","0.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Great visuals, great concept, great story (not a brand-new-fresh-from-the-oven concept though, but come on!, today there are no absolutely new concepts anyway, as most concepts are inspired on previous ideas and influences).\n\nAs many people say, I would've loved more soundtrack (the parts where it sounded were lovely and helped to get inspired), and maybe a little more intense voice acting (sometimes you could sort of feel the protagonist gave a ♥♥♥♥ about what happened, even if he should have been completely disturbed).\n\nLoved the couple of boss battles, where you had no more than your brain connections and memories to fight. Gave me the creeps! would've loved to see more of those battles though.\n\nNonetheless, this is a very good game, despite its flaws (come on, every game has flaws!). And anyway, the flaws this game has are no big deal anyway, the game is completely enjoyable, beautiful and definitely worth every penny.

The main character (I don't recall if he has a name or not) is chasing after his daughter, Sophia, in the world's most boring dreamscapes.  Exciting fun is to be had, as you walk on invisible pillars through the power of trial and error, carry tumbleweeds around aimlessly, and wander blindly in fog thicker than pea soup.  The only thing more thrilling than that gameplay is the ambling narration of the main character, as he puts about at a constant jogging pace.  I may have only gotten to three different "elements" (Fog, Night, Rain), but after an hour of play I think it is pretty safe to say that there is little to interest players who want more than a walking simulator.\n\nSome of environments are pretty (when not covered in fog/darkness) at least, but you have about as much effect on them as a ghost would, leaving neither footprints or shadow.

It popped up among the suggestions some day, after I played Ether One.\n\nThe game is in fact a little bit in the same style of Ether One. It involves puzzles, that may actually look a bit dumb at the beginning, but they are quite cool throughout the game.\n\nThe unreal engine is perfectly used in this game, both graphically and for the level design part. The game is very artistic and mostly immersive, with up and downs.\n\nThe major flaw is the narration and voice acting. The game does not combine much of the gameplay with the narration, and the narrator voice is just too quiet compared to the ambient sounds (you can't adjust them), and the acting is IMHO very poor. I would have rather read the story written on the level's walls (a bit like Dear Esther), than hearing it from that annoying voice.\n\nSome moments will leave you with your jaw dropped, but some others (eg while the guy speaks) will make you want to close the game.\n\nGame is very short so if you are one of those that relate price and gameplay hours, know that the game won't ever last more than 5 hours (I got all the trophies and played most chapters twice).\n\n75/100","February 21, 2015","true","7.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/296070/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Mind: Path to Thalamus is another entry into the narrative focused art games. This one struck me as having been highly influenced by Dear Esther (especially in the tone and pace of the narration, as well as some of the areas), coupled with a more puzzle-driven experience, not unlike Portal (its intent being completely different, though).\n\nUnfortunately, the writing was weak, in my opinion, and the game seems very incoherent in its quality. Some parts of the game were truly good, blending its audio-visual design very nicely with the puzzles, while others just fell flat on their face, with far more generic looks, and puzzles whose pieces were simply hidden, leading to a frustrating experience.\n\nPresentation\nThe first thing that strikes you in M:PtT is its visual fidelity. It has high quality textures and shaders that are very well used, especially at the start of the game. The skyboxes are  majestic -- that's the best way to describe it, very detailed and often chaotic, in a good way  -- paired well with the lighting effects. It's just an awesome looking game, if you like wandering around and sightseeing.\n\nDoesn't quite hold itself the whole way through\nThe only complaint I have with it is that, while the beach areas seem are brilliant, with a bit of classic architecture and nicely reflecting sand, some of the other areas are far blander. There was a cave almost identical to the one in Dear Esther (which is unfortunate, because it's certainly beautiful, despite losing the unique factor), and there are some cannyon-esque areas that are not that awe inducing.\nThe plain areas are also very well done with their use of color and foliage, very cool! There are also some more other-wordly realms that look pretty good.\n\nThe only technical problem with it was the popping that happened due to the low draw-distance with some objects, even with everything maxed.\n\nThe sound design was also very much alike Dear Esther. It's mostly very quiet and relaxing, with the occasional piano piece, and calm narration. It's certainly very atmospheric, and while not particularly memorable, I think it helps  carrying the experience!\n\nI have a few problems with the writing. Presumably, it was too esoteric and pretentious when the game launched, so they've rewritten the script, making the story more clear. Unfortunately, they've completely removed the old script, as it seems. I wanted to try it out for myself, but I don't think that's possible.\nWhat's left, is a perhaps too direct and concrete script about the story of the game. So concrete that it lacks identification with the player, unless you were in a similar situation... Which deals with running from a tornado. Not something many people have ever been involved with, I'd say!\nThis is perhaps not 100% fair, as there are aspects with which one could identify himself, but they're also so prevalent nowadays that it's a bit tiresome (related to guilt and family issues).\n\nThis story is given between the puzzles, during otherwise dead time. Since two of the characters share the same name (for story reasons) it can be a bit confusing at times to know who exactly the game's talking about, due to the fragmented exposition.\n\nRegardless, I don't think it's bad, just felt a bit underwhelming, taken the rest of the presentation. I think I would have liked to at least play through the original script.\n\n\nGeneral Mechanics\nThe game's puzzles revolve around "manipulating weather". However, it's not as cool as it sounds, and it's only so metaphorically speaking. The main characters (from what I understood, a family tradition of sorts) studies weather phenomena. There's the connection.\nHowever, how the weather changes affect the game's mechanics is completely untied to actual weather, working just as a mechanic. With which there's nothing wrong, but it feels like the developer tried a bit too hard and in the end dropped the ball, for the most part.\n\nThe puzzles are a mixture of conception and execution, the latter relying on the physics system, which is not very well explained at all.\nYou have a neuro-something sphere, that you place in an element circle, to activate it. You can also stand on those circles yourself to activate said weather mechanic.\nYou can control Fog, Day and Night, Rain, and Time. Night opens up portals, and something gives you a ball that only appears during the night, Rain rises platforms, Fog gives you access to small area (and propulsion -- where the physics come in), and Time reconstructs some buildings. -- Looking back at it, there's connection between the mechanics and the actual story, though very subtle.\nGenerally, you wander around the levels, find the pieces, and then place the sphere and yourself sequentially, following a very linear path to the end of the level.\n\nIt certainly sounds good in concept! And sometimes, they were nicely designed, on other times, not really. I'll now discuss the particular points that made this game frustrating, to me.\n\n1.Invisible and/or Artificial Walls\nThis is a big sore spot, to me. The game features these very fast, ever expanding areas that look absolutely amazing. There's also an almost perfect ballance between empty space and "landmarks" in some levels.\nHowever, once you try to go off the path, the game blocks you path with an invisible walls. On the first levels, this wasn't really an issue, as it seemed to give you quite a lot of freedom. later on, though, it revealed itself as something different.\n\nFor such an atmospheric experience, letting the player wonder would be far for enjoyable -- perhaps having an improved Dear Esther influence, maybe even giving some of the more esoteric script passages to the player during those moments.\n\nThe biggest issue with this, though, is how they place a single pillar or tree off in the distance, isolated from everything else. In any other game, this would be like a beacon, something for the player to investigate! Of course, once you walk 5 steps, you'll encounter an invisible wall. It feels so counter-intuitive... If there's to be a wall there, don't place those beacons. I mean, since so obvious that I'm not sure I'm missing some deep metaphor, here... Oh well. It could be much more by changing this simple aspect.\n\n\n2.Puzzles are most about finding the pieces than putting them together\nSounds cute, but what exactly do I mean.\nAside from being very limiting, exploration-wise, the levels can be quite large -- which may sound contradictory, but stick with it.\nWhile somewhat large, they're very linear in where you can go. However, since the various pieces are so spread, every solution you might think of, will often take more time than it needed. Moreover, if it fails, you'll have to wander around for some more time, because it's not very clear, most of the time.\n\nFor example, one puzzle was literally about taking the sphere and walking in a very defined path in front of you. You would finish the level in 10 seconds. However, that was only due to its initial conditions. If you took the sphere and went somewhere else, you would break those conditions. I felt rather lost, to be honest. The problem with that level was that you could not see the consequences of your actions. This happens more than once.\nThis is very frustrating. You could solve the puzzles by pure luck quickly -- otherwise, you'd have to rely on guesswork and trial and error.\n\nConclusion\nEnough rambling. I think I've written about my biggest problems with Mind: Path to Thalamus.\nIt's a very beautiful game, and the first level really impressed me, even from a puzzle standpoint. Unfortunately, the rest of the game doesn't seem to have as much work and polish put into it, and ends up having some very frustrating puzzles, hurting the rest of the experience a lot.","January 21, 2015","false","8.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

One of the "puzzles" consist of you moving a ball over big countryside from one place to another... in a thick mist where you can barely see anything.

I can't really say much about the narrative beacuse as of yet I feel like I've learnt nothing and I feel no connection to the protagonist and his daughter whatsoever.\n\nMy main fault is with the gameplay itself. So far the puzzles have been annoying rather than challenging, forcing you to search a large area (at a painfully slow pace due to the lack of a sprint option) in order to find a ball or where to place it. This, added to the artistic/abstract way in which they're presented makes the puzzles longer but no more enjoyable. Either that or challenging for all the wrong reasons. I just found them entirely tedious.\n\nAnother thing was the size of the area you were allowed to roam in - it is much larger than you need in some places but with no reward for exploring that I've seen so far. This is made all the more irritating by the slow pace at which you're forced to travel. There's no interesting information, just more views. The visuals are stunning I do admit, to the point where I have screenshots in amongst my computer backgrounds. However I was expecting more of a relaxed atmosphere - there were several points when I just felt kinda creeped out :P\n\nAll in all based on what I've seen I wouldn't get this again - and I essentially paid pennies for this in a Humble Bundle.

I'm intrigued by its visual beauty but trying to find meaning or interest in the shallow wastelands of this looker's mental landscape is a chore.  This is so unfortunate, because this game has so much promise. Though uninspired level design and visually obfuscated terrains spent searching for one useful item turn the game into basically a 3D pixel hunt and is such a slog I can't bring myself to finish it.\n\nPROS:\n+ Truly imaginative and awesome visual design\n+ Limited, but effective music\n+ A somewhat intriguing storyline (so far as I can tell)\n\nCONS:\n+ One note puzzle system gets tired quickly\n+ Objectives are often obscured by annoying atmospheric effects\n+ Searching expansive environments at a bone-crushingly slow speeds is UBER-tedious\n\nI bought this game after watching the truly impressive opening sequence in a Giant Bomb Quick Look.  I turned it off early so I wouldn't spoil my experience by seeing too much.  But in the end I should have watched the rest and exposed myself to the simple yet often-times obtuse puzzle system and saved myself a few bucks.

Thalamus is doesn't seem to have anything to do with any outside force, other than the 'elements' of nature.  And still even then these 'elements' can be and are very, very cheap.

While I have to credit these fellas for making changes and listening to us, I am still unable to sell this to you. YET, FOLLOW THESE BOYS! THEY HAVE LEARNED FROM THEIR MISTAKES AND NEED SOME SUPPORT! Unlike most developers out there, once they are wrong they give up! This is not the case here and to be honest... I want to give it a thumbs up, but I paid for the original release and that is what the following review is based upon. Enjoy, your life.\n\n\nNow before we get started, I know a lot of you here are going to buy this regardless of what I write and while you shell out your cash, you will probably be thinking that I just don't get it. That is not at all correct, I spend most of my time on puzzle and/or story driven games. This is a product aimed at those of us that love surrealism and storytelling, but don't let that be the only reason you want to spend hard earned cash on it. I for one love anything that gets me thinking or asking questions. Sadly, this game had me asking all the wrong questions and came across as an ego trip.\n\nI don't want to be only negative, so I will point out that this game is not hard on the eyes when the screen is not tearing from time to time. Also, the music when playing is decent, it just always seems to fade away or get cut off before being allowed to really go anywhere amazing. Now let me get to why I am not able to recommend this product. It has a lot to do with the poor writing being about as good as the voice acting and the game design making you wonder, 'was that a bug?' For example, in the prologue I came to a point where the puzzle had me wondering, was that even suppose to happen? I do understand this was intended to be a cool little illusion type puzzle, but it seems sloppy and lazy.\n\nFor some reason, the game makers think having you use reflections to find your way is fun. Followed by some trial and error puzzles that involve placing things in the right areas, that quickly become more of a chore than entertainment. By now you might be thinking, 'If I smoke some bud it has to be cool, right?' WRONG! If anything, you are going to find yourself cheesed out by the terrible writing that has such a hard on for itself.\n\nThe screen tearing really is ugly when it does happen, it's not a lot but it does like to pop up; just could have been avoided all together. There is too much walking from one point to the next making any back~tracking that much more painful. The bad design has the game come across as rushed and broken when really these choices are on purpose in order to throw you off.\n\nThe story is pretencious, with the main character going on and on about himself. The amount of times I heard the players character mention his daughters name in the first few minutes became annoying and way over written. It seems as if the developers made this in a bedroom, while the voice actor sounds as if he just wants to go home. I would be more kind if this game was not so full of pretentious bull$hit. The writer seems to be patting himself on the back the entire game, forcing words into the script out of nowhere as if he just learned them and wants to show off.\n\nThe worlds seem forced, as if trying to be strange instead of mind~blowing or awe~inspiring. We have seen this all before and I don't see why there is any reason to choose this over some of the other 3D puzzle games on the market. I came across a lot of invisible walls, something I thought no longer existed in games these days. After awhile I just stopped trying to explore the worlds, since I was always stopped, keeping me stuck walking across fields knowing that it looks open, but is really linear.\n\nI understand this is suppose to be art and that I should have an open mind, (which I do) yet if that is how you want to look at it, then the art here is far too self indulged, closing your mind and making you see what the developers want you to see. The price is not so steep that I feel robbed completely, still I did pay enough to where I am let down by the product.\n\nIf it was written better and the voice actor for the main character was not so off, I could put up with the level design and other problems. Everytime I hear the main voice actor speak about his daughter, all I can think to myself is how he does not sound at all like a strom chaser/father, and instead a game developer who really wants you to admire his work. It also comes across as if he is reading his lines right off a piece of paper for the first time.\n\nI really hate to give this a thumbs down since it could have been something, yet there are other games out there better than this. If you really must play something new and have yet to enjoy, A Story About My Uncle, then try that first. It is far better than this on all levels and if you need more surreal worlds and 3D puzzles, then maybe this is for you, just get ready for a character that loves to hear his own voice. I'll end this review with a quote from the game.\n"All this sounds pretty cheesy and lame, I'm sure.

You'll be hauling tumbleweed balls (that inconveniently block a huge chunk of your vision) made out of synapses until the cows come home, or rather until the pretentious story finally reaches its disappointing conclusion.\n\nAnnoying voice acting and story, puzzles that frequently require hefty doses of trial-and-error and some extremely dubious gameplay elements (ultra-thick fog, anyone?) really made this one a drag.

Not worth the $11 on spent on a game that offers hardly any replayability.\n\nIt seems that much of the difficulty in this game is traversing the large spaces these puzzles take place in, which leads to me to think of it as a difficulty substitute, granted the final few puzzles took me a while to figure out despite the walking back and forth, and I did feel a sense of accomplishment when I completed it.\n\nThe dialogue and plotline are really where this game falls flat for me. There is too much prententious dialogue which I felt would make for a cerebral ending, something that would make me think if even for a minute. I was wrong, the game wrapped it self up leaving little to be desired.\n\nI suppose I'll play through again for the steam achievements, maybe I'll find some fun easteregg, by my hopes are nigh.\n\nOverall I have to give this game's:\nStory 4/10\nDialogue 5/10\nAudio 8/10\nGraphics 9/10\nAtmosphere 10/10","August 5, 2014","false","6.0"," 15 of 40 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","15","40","0","5"

Set in a truly breathtaking dream-world, the main gameplay features are some light platforming and puzzle-solving.\n\nThe puzzles are not very challenging, taking a little time to figure out the first time, but mostly just there to drive you through the narrative as well as making you explore in the beautiful world.\n\nThe biggest criticism of the game at release was the voice-over narration which just felt distracting and annoying with its near-constant presence. However this was later toned down quite a bit, but the ending part still has an extremely annoying voice-over that just runs on repeat and completely destroys the mood of the game.\n\nThe game seems very well optimized and runs perfectly fine on my 5 year old machine with a GTX580 card.\n\nApart from its minor flaws, I really recommend this game for fans of slow-paced contemplative games.","September 20, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was gorgeous. The story was present, but not intrusive enough for the gameplay. The mechanic was simple and intelligent in design, providing puzzles that weren't terribly frustrating, but made you think outside the box. Even the sounds were spot-on (except for the ice breaking, which sounding like someone eating potato chips), with a music that was present in an airy, mystical sense that one would expect with a game based in the mind without being intrusive and a scenery that had a perfect blend for a psychological atmosphere: realism with touches of fantasy and delusion that made sense with the premise of the story.\n\nNow, the one downfall everyone points out: the narration. I don't think the voice actor himself was annoying, for he did well during the panic during the beginning in the real world. It was the tone. I got a sense of peace and relaxation with the game, while facing confusion and tension towards the end. The "boss battle" was a great set-up, but the constant chattering of said 'boss' was extremely irritating. The exposition towards the end was unbearable: good storytelling should LET the player figure stuff out (i.e. don't point out that the shapes are representative of neurons, all of the metaphors and symbols were easily accessible, including what the boss represents). The off-humor and pseudo-existential ramblings that sound as wise as Holden Caufield's tantrums were definitely not needed--the philosophy of this path was also quite clearly present.\n\nThe developers said they wanted to throw in snippets of the story as they progressed through puzzles. I concur. It wasn't too bad throughout most of the game. However, it gets way too overdramatic, cliche, and frankly, I only liked hearing the protagonist's actual voice at the beginning and some at the end. In the consciousness realms, subtitles or another creative silent way to show the story would've fit much better.\n\nOverall, it really was a great game and experience, anywhere from four to six hours of gameplay (if that's not worth it for $12.99, keep a lookout for it on sale). Like I said, the only downfall was that god-forsaken narration. Loved the story. Loved the gameplay. Loved the motifs.

Earlier on in the game, I had dismissed the comments in reviews that detracted the voice acting, thinking "it's not so bad". But now, having finally finished the game, I understand. While I think the story itself is very interesting, the way it is told and not shown ruins the execution. The narration seems to assume that the player is not clever enough to understand what is going on unless it is painstakingly explained by way of pretentious voice-acting. At times, it even seems to be self-deprecating, as if aware of some of its own flaws. The ending is particularly guilty of this, which very nearly robs the player of any satisfaction to be found in the resolution of the story. In particular, the comments about the "evil ball of death" and the voice-swapping were sheer moments of face-palm for me. So despite the fact that I found this game incredible on several other levels, it left me on a sour note. Am I implying I could have done a better job with the writing? Absolutely not, and I have to stress that I commend the creators of this game for such an excellent story and concept. I just feel that the game would have nothing to lose and everything to gain by simply removing the narration entirely. Perhaps this could even be a settings option to just disable it. For bonus points, the game could "show" a bit more of the story along the way in place of telling it.\n\nNow that my complaints are out of the way, I can get on to writing about what an amazing game this is, on every other level. Based on the concept, design, and gameplay, it could have been the ideal game for me. I was overjoyed to find a game based on the intersection of the exploration of consciousness and psychology with fantastical landscapes and locations - something like that is right up my alley. And indeed, that's what this is, and it's executed wonderfully. Many of the level designs, art concepts and effects that you'll experience here are truly stunning, and I found this to be even more true as I approached the end. While the puzzle mechanics could have used a bit more diversity, the different ways they are combined in the more challenging puzzles keeps things fresh and enjoyably mind-bending. The gameplay is at its most satisfying when it nudges you to think in new ways in order to solve different types of puzzles. And the locations are perpetually screenshot-worthy, always vast and mysterious, a joy to explore. Each of these elements are incredibly well-executed and provide a unique experience.\n\nI spent about 5 hours here and would gladly enjoy another playthrough someday. I don't feel the flaws in the game come close to eclipsing the things it does well, so I can only click the recommend button, and hope you enjoy this game with appropriately adjusted expectations for the narration.","December 21, 2014","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a metaphorical narrative, it leaves something to be desired.\n\nThe game play of Mind is simple, in order to proceed you have to bring these blue tumbleweed things to various locations in order to manipulate the environmental aspects of day/night, weather, and time in order to unlock the path forward. Utilizing a gradual learning curve that still offers a challenge, Mind starts you off with one element at a time - for instance: teaching you that sometimes an object you need may be visible only at night and then having you figure out how to acquire this object without sacrificing some other aspect of your progression - before introducing multiple elements at once By the end of the game you're very much thinking 4th dimensionally about things, but even the head-scratchingest of puzzles were logical in the end. Even at my most frustrated, I never thought "that's a stupid solution" and instead was more apt to berate myself for not having noticed it sooner.\n\nMore than just eye candy. Mind utilizes its surreal environments to full effect, with puzzles involving everything from reflections to portals, and gravity. Sadly however the story seems virtually divorced from the game play aside from the its heavy handed ending levels. Unlike Papo & Yo (another surreal adventure puzzler) Mind says too much too often and relies too much on narration and all-too-obvious symbols to achieve its metaphor. The gameplay could easily be read as part of the main character's coma-induced journey, but it rarely relates directly to the subjects and experiences the narrator talks about. Add to this the fairly amateur voice acting and VERY uneven dialogue volume (with no option to adjust) and Mind's narrative experience fell a little flat with me, feeling extraneous at best and pretentious at worst.\n\nOverall the game was an enjoyable experience however and for the environments and puzzles alone is worth checking out. There are some interesting ideas at work here that I felt justified my time spent with the game.","January 6, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sheer scale of some of the things that happen in this game is breathtaking.  (Visually, this might be the best use of the Unreal engine I've ever seen.)  Without being too specific about the puzzles, once you figure out that backtracking is a thing, they strike a decent balance between fair and challenging - they're mostly fun and totally solvable if sometimes a bit cryptic.  The narrator is a prick - but I think that's part of the point.  He's a deeply flawed guy - and while the game's journey does represent a maturing process for him - he's still kind of a prick with loads of baggage.  It's as if he's searching too hard for meaning - calls himself out on it - and keeps doing it anyway.  If you can get past the imperfect character, the game is amazing - worth playing for the art direction and execution alone.  It may not be as polished as Portal 2 - but it's made by a much smaller team, and the artistic aspect of the game really knocks it out of the park.  If you like surrealism - this is for you.  Dive in, and get lost in another world.\n\n8/10 highly recommended.","December 29, 2014","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Earlier on in the game, I had dismissed the comments in reviews that detracted the voice acting, thinking "it's not so bad". But now, having finally finished the game, I understand. While I think the story itself is very interesting, the way it is told and not shown ruins the execution. The narration seems to assume that the player is not clever enough to understand what is going on unless it is painstakingly explained by way of pretentious voice-acting. At times, it even seems to be self-deprecating, as if aware of some of its own flaws. The ending is particularly guilty of this, which very nearly robs the player of any satisfaction to be found in the resolution of the story. In particular, the comments about the "evil ball of death" and the voice-swapping were sheer moments of face-palm for me. So despite the fact that I found this game incredible on several other levels, it left me on a sour note. Am I implying I could have done a better job with the writing? Absolutely not, and I have to stress that I commend the creators of this game for such an excellent story and concept. I just feel that the game would have nothing to lose and everything to gain by simply removing the narration entirely. Perhaps this could even be a settings option to just disable it. For bonus points, the game could "show" a bit more of the story along the way in place of telling it.\n\nNow that my complaints are out of the way, I can get on to writing about what an amazing game this is, on every other level. Based on the concept, design, and gameplay, it could have been the ideal game for me. I was overjoyed to find a game based on the intersection of the exploration of consciousness and psychology with fantastical landscapes and locations - something like that is right up my alley. And indeed, that's what this is, and it's executed wonderfully. Many of the level designs, art concepts and effects that you'll experience here are truly stunning, and I found this to be even more true as I approached the end. While the puzzle mechanics could have used a bit more diversity, the different ways they are combined in the more challenging puzzles keeps things fresh and enjoyably mind-bending. The gameplay is at its most satisfying when it nudges you to think in new ways in order to solve different types of puzzles. And the locations are perpetually screenshot-worthy, always vast and mysterious, a joy to explore. Each of these elements are incredibly well-executed and provide a unique experience.\n\nI spent about 5 hours here and would gladly enjoy another playthrough someday. I don't feel the flaws in the game come close to eclipsing the things it does well, so I can only click the recommend button, and hope you enjoy this game with appropriately adjusted expectations for the narration.","December 21, 2014","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was gorgeous. The story was present, but not intrusive enough for the gameplay. The mechanic was simple and intelligent in design, providing puzzles that weren't terribly frustrating, but made you think outside the box. Even the sounds were spot-on (except for the ice breaking, which sounding like someone eating potato chips), with a music that was present in an airy, mystical sense that one would expect with a game based in the mind without being intrusive and a scenery that had a perfect blend for a psychological atmosphere: realism with touches of fantasy and delusion that made sense with the premise of the story.\n\nNow, the one downfall everyone points out: the narration. I don't think the voice actor himself was annoying, for he did well during the panic during the beginning in the real world. It was the tone. I got a sense of peace and relaxation with the game, while facing confusion and tension towards the end. The "boss battle" was a great set-up, but the constant chattering of said 'boss' was extremely irritating. The exposition towards the end was unbearable: good storytelling should LET the player figure stuff out (i.e. don't point out that the shapes are representative of neurons, all of the metaphors and symbols were easily accessible, including what the boss represents). The off-humor and pseudo-existential ramblings that sound as wise as Holden Caufield's tantrums were definitely not needed--the philosophy of this path was also quite clearly present.\n\nThe developers said they wanted to throw in snippets of the story as they progressed through puzzles. I concur. It wasn't too bad throughout most of the game. However, it gets way too overdramatic, cliche, and frankly, I only liked hearing the protagonist's actual voice at the beginning and some at the end. In the consciousness realms, subtitles or another creative silent way to show the story would've fit much better.\n\nOverall, it really was a great game and experience, anywhere from four to six hours of gameplay (if that's not worth it for $12.99, keep a lookout for it on sale). Like I said, the only downfall was that god-forsaken narration. Loved the story. Loved the gameplay. Loved the motifs. Hated the exposition.","September 4, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However this was later toned down quite a bit, but the ending part still has an extremely annoying voice-over that just runs on repeat and completely destroys the mood of the game.\n\nThe game seems very well optimized and runs perfectly fine on my 5 year old machine with a GTX580 card.\n\nApart from its minor flaws, I really recommend this game for fans of slow-paced contemplative games.","September 20, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What made this little gem worth playing through was the scenery and overall atmosphere.  Excellently done on the graphics, simple but beautiful all the same.  Puzzles range from fairly obvious to moderately difficult depending on your experience.\n\nMy big peeve with the game is regarding one of the last levels.

I spent over an hour without making any progress because after I solved part of the puzzle, the level no longer let me change some of the weather.  It's also important to note that in this particular level, after having solved a portion of it, I could not reverse it.  I had to start over after watching a walkthrough.  Furthermore, this level from what I gathered was the ONLY one in the game where if you messed up, you had no choice but to start over.

It reminded me a lot of Myst / Riven,  but with full control over your character.\n\nThe game is basically a journey through a man's mind.  I believe he and his father were former 'storm chasers'.  Tragedy strikes, leaving a list of hurt, regret, and confusion.    Throughout the levels, you seem to be 'repairing' damaged parts of his memories and/or neural pathways.  You are treated to dialogue along the way that explains this history of the protagonist, but toward the end, things get really confusing, and I wasn't able to fully understand the finale.  The voice acting is ok, but at times it comes off a little cheesy.\n\nAll-in-all, I would totally recommend this game to anyone who loves puzzle games such as Myst.   I paid 7 dollars for the game, and felt it was just the right amount since I was able to  beat the entire game in about 4-5 hours.\n\nGo to my profile and check out my screenshots of the game!","February 10, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, some of the puzzles are tedious such as searching a large area when you can only see about 3 feet in front of you and others are frustrating, such as slowly moving while trying to dodge objects from the sky only to get repeatedly crushed. Also, the story isn't great and the voice acting is worse. The game appears to have been deeloped by a Spanish game studio so presumably this is a translated version, but it feels like someone's buddy volunteered to do the voice -- it just doesn't match the professional value of the visuals.

The story, not so much engrossing, is interesting to a point.  Voice acting was more or less average.  Soundtrack was serene and elegantly composed.  What made this little gem worth playing through was the scenery and overall atmosphere.  Excellently done on the graphics, simple but beautiful all the same.  Puzzles range from fairly obvious to moderately difficult depending on your experience.\n\nMy big peeve with the game is regarding one of the last levels.  I can't really explain it without spoiling anything, but you have to execute the puzzle a certain way or else you can't finish it.  I spent over an hour without making any progress because after I solved part of the puzzle, the level no longer let me change some of the weather.  It's also important to note that in this particular level, after having solved a portion of it, I could not reverse it.  I had to start over after watching a walkthrough.  Furthermore, this level from what I gathered was the ONLY one in the game where if you messed up, you had no choice but to start over.  I understand and appreciate it when puzzle games don't take you by the hand and help you every step of the way but with this case, it was incredibly frustrating not knowing a mistake you made in the puzzle was irreversible.\n\n7/10","March 7, 2015","true","16.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You walk slow, you take in the scenery, and you solve some pretty decent puzzles. That's it. The fantastic environments are the best thing about this game, and if you have the patience to deal with the slow movement speed, it can be a very good game.

Yes, the visuals in this game are quite amazing, very nicely done and awesome to just look at, but still if you're not into puzzles it is not worth it. If you do, there are some challenging puzzles in this game, some took me a while to solve. The hours shown are not actually the hours played, since i sometimes leave the game on when i do something else in the meantime. I do think it took me around 6 hours. Fortunately most of the time the puzzles are challenging but logical. Some puzzles did not make sense to me at all which i think is a bit annoying.\n\nOne very bad aspect was the narrating. The game is narrated by the main character but the voice acting is absolutely terrible, and so is the writing. Even though the story is ok, i could not really enjoy it due to the annoying narrator. However, he does not talk often.\n\nSo summing up; if you like puzzles: play!

The game is downright gorgeous. It runs well even on my Intel HD Graphics Card laptop. The puzzles are actually simple in design, but complex to solve at times, which is a great balance. While the mechanics themselves are simple, it's the order of the puzzles which provides the challenge - it requires you to actually use your brain! The story was pleasing, and I actually found myself emotionally effected at times, be it fear, sadness, awe, terror or joy. Few games can cycle a player through those emotions, and Path to Thalamus did a fantastic job. My only criticism of this entire game is a repeat of what others have said, that at times the voice acting can be a little "dry". It's not that it was terrible, but there were many times that I just didn't fell immersed by the narration. IE: It wasn't believable. That said, it was not a bother at all, and without the voice overs, the game would have been less, so I am actually glad that they were there. All in all, if you are looking for a challenging yet relaxing game, with beautiful visuals, great music, a pretty well though-out story, and a satisfying conclusion, this is probably something you will enjoy. Definitely recommended.","August 22, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I just wish they had applied the same amount of care and devotion to the story, writing, and dialogue.  Everything about the story feels like a very rough draft, written and recorded in one take on a lazy afternoon.  I can't help but wonder if the writer was trying to work through some of their own personal issues by shoe-horning them into this game.\n\nIt works well enough as a game.  A series of mechanics that a user must manipulate in order to reach the next level.  The puzzles are challenging and will consume a few hours of your evening.  But as an interactive story, it barely reaches mediocre.\n\nAnd the ending... god the ending. I won't spoil anything for you, but... maybe just shut the game off and uninstall it before the "final boss battle".  Yeah, an emotive story/puzzle game about coping with death ends with a stereotypical final boss battle.  If that doesn't clue you in to how disjointed the last chapter of this game feels, then I assure you your money is better spent elsewhere.  Reaching the final boss put me over the 2-hour limit to get a refund.  I'm going to request one anyway just to test the waters.\n\nLike I said, the puzzles are expertly crafted, and the maps are stunning to behold.  I found myself taking several screenshots throughout my play session.  For these reasons I do recommend the game.  But only with the caveat that everything else about the game felt like an afterthought.\n\nI would suggest playing the game on mute, with the subtitles turned on.  Any voice you can conjure in your head will be miles ahead of the recorded dialogue in terms of quality and believability.","June 27, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics and visuals are great, even though they occasionally appear as though the game is artifacting rather than showing you a beautiful particle effect.  The sound is great, and the puzzles are really the highlight here, with enough to keep the best puzzle enthusiasts busy for quite some time.  The whole game has a nice somber story with a relaxing/mellow mood for the most part, which really brings the games story to life.\n\nFor the price, I would recommend this game for its experience, and its puzzles but not really it's mechanics.\n\nI do like the games story, and the visuals and sound, but there are two big downsides, that only the price of the game and the quality of the puzzles keep me from downvoting it from.\n\nThe voice acting of the game is horrendous, but I never expected much from a small indie game like this.  The bigger issue is that the gameplay controls are terrible.  They're clunky and at the same time float-y.  Your character feels heavy and hard to move around soemtimes, and then other times, it feels like you're hovering off of the ground when you're moving through the levels, which really took away from the experience for me.\n\nIn short, I would recommend this game, but mostly because the story is interesting and the puzzles are challenging, but the game controls and the voice acting really break the immersion for me, but the game is still worth a shot for those interested.","October 29, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VDub42/recommended/296070/","VDub42","Lysander","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VDub42/","772 products in account","Mind is a pretty straighforward first person puzzle game.  There are only a handful of mechanics, but the puzzles increase in difficulty relatively smoothly as the game progresses.  I played this game hoping it would be similar to Myst, but it isn't.  Mind is very linear.  The logic involved isn't quite as engaging as Myst or Kairo, but you probably aren't going to get stuck due to a disconnect between how you think and how the developers want you to think.  The game boils down to find a ball, put the ball where it's supposed to be, advance to next puzzle.  A lot of people compare this game to Dear Esther.  That is a pretty fair comparison.  I would consider Mind to be 70% Dear Esther, 20% Kairo, and 10% Myst.\n\nMind has a lot of very beautiful scenery and magnificent lighting.  Just looking around is a lot fun,  Unfortunately there are huge amounts of empty space that ultimately don't add much to the experience.  There is a desparate need for a sprint function.  Early on I would explore to see more of the environments, but you have to slowly wander back to where you were supposed to be.  At times, the only difficulty in progressing is trying to find the ball in a large environment.  Still, a lot of the environments are pretty cool, especially the ones that are more surreal.\n\nIt may sound kind of droll, but the game is still pretty engaging.  There's a somewhat decent story as you progress.  It's not too long, which I consider a plus because it doesn't overstay its welcome, and I never got stuck for significant time until the last main puzzle.\n\nOverall, Mind is pretty simple but incredibly polished.  I love the small details, like rolling the ball if you hold it close to the ground as you move, or the effect of light shining through the ball's holes when you hold it up to a light source.  I would recommend playing it if you're looking for an artsy eyecandy game with semi-casual puzzle elements.\n\n","June 8, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Beware - if you're playing this game at night, there are some super bright lights which gave made my eyes hurt.\nGRAPHICS: 9/10\n\nThere were some bugs at the time I played this game.

First off, there is seemingly only 2 new puzzles, both are astoundingly easy and primarily used to teach you how certain mechanics work (one of which never actually appeared to come up again). But the real disaster here is the completely altered ending sequence, with the original final level being removed. The part of the game that I really enjoyed. Now it's just a middle of the run, less than super interesting environmental puzzle game.\n\n[Original write-up]\nMIND is pretty short all things considered, and most of the puzzles along the way are pretty straight forward until the last 2 chapters, and has a few odd collision and geometry issues, but none of that matters. What matters is the interesting story of redemption of a man longing for forgiveness for letting his sister die in a disaster. Story is simply well done, and all comes together in a brilliant last 20 minutes when the entire game is turned on it's head and borders on breaking the fourth wall.\n\nIn those last 20 minutes, I went from merely enjoying the game, to absolutely loving what MIND has done here.","August 10, 2014","false","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's really a matter of trial and error and hopefully don't get too frustrated and throw the mouse through the monitor....\nOnce you get the basic gist of whats going on it often the limited controls make it extremely hard to do what you want.  For example sometime you'll through the object your carrying, sometimes you simply drop it, other times you can't drop it unless you look upwards....\nIts awkward to walk along edges etc as there is no real sense of placement in the world.\nThe puzzles themselves are very clever in many cases and does get you thinking.  Like I said, the game is generally good and a great concept ...\nFinally on the negative side, some levels are just obscure.  One level near the end you can't move and simply look at the shiny dots????\nGraphics etc are okay and suit the style very well.  The sound could be improved, especially with the narratives as sometimes you can barely hear what is being said.\nYou can pick the levels you want to play from the menu, but unfortuantely there is no indication of what the level is actually named while playing, so many times you simply need to guess what level it was and hope.  This is the only way I was actually able to bet through some levels due to obscurity in the puzzles.  Again it would be nice with some bassic help.\nFinally though I will say that I enjoyed parts of the game and only hope that the game will improve with a bit of polish!\nI do recommend this game for those that are interested in puzzle type games, but do warn that it is definitely not for every one, and can get extremely frustrating...\n","December 12, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/enixe/recommended/296070/","enixe","Enix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/enixe/","174 products in account","MIND: Path to Thalamus is a narrative puzzle experience.\n\nDesign & ArtThe most obvious strongpoint of this game is its design and art. When I first played the game, it really drew me in instantly. I have never seen more beautifully crafted worlds and places in any game I played. Fitting color palettes, light and ethereal music support the visuals of the game positively.\n\nControlsThe controls are pretty straightforward; if you played any shooter in the last century, you’ll have no problems whatsoever. You play from First-Person-perspective.\n\nSound & MusicSounddesign is well managed and fitting. The music supports the game, feels well placed in concordance with most of the visuals and enhanced the gameplay.\n\nGameplayThe puzzles (which are the fundamental basis of this game) are forgiving enough at the beginning and get procedurally harder during the game. You can solve them with pure wit, sometimes you need trial and error (which, in my opinion, is rather a last resort than a viable solution to a problem). I have to note that most of the puzzles also require a LOT of walking. Solving a puzzle for the first time will take some duration and tenacity, since there is no running option in the game.\n\nWeakpointsThe game seems rather simplistic in its design and gameplay which positively supports the game, but that same simplicity also mortifies “Path to Thalamus”.\n\nThe narrative part of the game is a very interesting topic (human psychology of loss and grief), yet its execution feels shallow and amiss. During the game, you rather scrape than plunge into said topics. The narrative picks you up at the beginning, but loses itself during later parts of the game. The voice acting feels cringeworthy at times and didn’t make me feel immersed enough. I guess the common disliking of the narrative part of the game lead to its near complete removal of the story in the “enhanced version” of the game (it is optional now, you don’t need to listen to the story). One of its weakpoints is fairly common among story-driven games: Replayability is completely out of the question, just like in Frictional Games’ “Amnesia” and “Penumbra”-series.\n\nAnd speaking of the devil, the “enhanced version” of the game (which was introduced recently) is the biggest thorn in my side. Holy hell. I bought and played the game before the new version and liked it to a certain degree. The “enhanced version” really ruined it for me. The game now runs more badly than before, I get way less Fps than before on the same settings, yet my hardware hasn’t changed. My PC fulfills all of the recommended settings.\n\nNot only that. At the same time, the graphics are now worse than before! How could this happen? The game is now more colorful than before, contrasts are higher (to a degree in which I couldn’t even see in the darkness, where before I could), my native resolution is now not supported by standard (What the frick?!), handling of objects feels worse and the ending and certain puzzles have been completely reworked.\n\nConcluding ThoughtsI really enjoyed the journey through someones elses mind. I can toss aside bad storylines by simply ignoring them. If you are a person, who enjoys beautifully crafted worlds and light puzzle solving, I urge you to get this game and install the old version of it (game options under steam -> betas -> old_mind). I cannot and will not support the new version of the game, since it feels worse than the unenhanced version. Don’t let yourself get fooled by this game's looks, while being beautiful, its narrative feels unstructured and messy. A real shame, because I want to love the game on both of these aspects. Yet I still enjoyed the game to a certain degree.\n\nEnjoy with caution. Do not play the new version if you want a decent experience with the game.","December 13, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First off, there is seemingly only 2 new puzzles, both are astoundingly easy and primarily used to teach you how certain mechanics work (one of which never actually appeared to come up again). But the real disaster here is the completely altered ending sequence, with the original final level being removed. The part of the game that I really enjoyed. Now it's just a middle of the run, less than super interesting environmental puzzle game.\n\n[Original write-up]\nMIND is pretty short all things considered, and most of the puzzles along the way are pretty straight forward until the last 2 chapters, and has a few odd collision and geometry issues, but none of that matters. What matters is the interesting story of redemption of a man longing for forgiveness for letting his sister die in a disaster. Story is simply well done, and all comes together in a brilliant last 20 minutes when the entire game is turned on it's head and borders on breaking the fourth wall.\n\nIn those last 20 minutes, I went from merely enjoying the game, to absolutely loving what MIND has done here.","August 10, 2014","false","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No explainations or hints. Just problems in your face. Deal with it.\n\nThe story makes no sense and is completely irrelvant to the experience, which is a bit sad as I think it was trying to be deep and mysterious. It seems deep and mysterious, and it is, but the visuals carry it, not the story.\n\nIt glitched out on me once, making a puzzle impossible to do. I came back later to make one last attempt and it was different. Strangest glitch ever. And it wasn't just me seeing things I didn't see last time. Weird things that were there last time were gone, and a broken thing wasn't broken any more. Was it part of the game? Was I meant to give up and turn it off to solve the puzzle? Who knows.\n\nTo make it stranger still, having now completed the game, I realise there's a way to get through it without even going to that gltiched out room. Bizarre.\n\nThere seems to be a few ways to progress sometimes, though there may only be one way the leads to progress and the others send you backwards. I had one instance of that, which sent me through the glitch room. I get the feeling there was probably a handful of time I could have gone the "wrong" way and ended up going backwards. Funny thing about this game is you're never sure about anything, which both adds to and takes away from the experience. Mostly it was a good thing. Adds to the dream like quality of the experience.\n\nHowever, having said that, it's not as dream like as it could have been, but again, there's no explaination going in about what's happening, what should happen, or what you should do about it, so it's hard to say what they were going for.\n\nIt makes slightly more sense by the end and is an interesting journey. I made it through without a walkthrough, which is the only sense of accomplishment you'll get out of it. If you cheat, the experiencce won't be worthwhile in my opinion.\n\nOverall I liked it, and I do recommend it, however having just finished it, the experience wasn't as rewarding as I was hoping.\n\n[Slight Story Spoiler! I don't say what the story is, I just say what it isn't, which may ruin the mystery of it]\n\nI think it's mainly the story that ruined it for me. It tried so hard to have one, and while it's easy to understand, it's hard to understand how the game is related to it, or why it was a story worth telling.\n\nIn my opinion it would have been a lot better if they went for a trippy, hard to understand story. Something that can be interpreted in a lot of ways. Something that makes a point and leaves you nodding slowing during the end credits, rubbing your chin, thinking about love, life and the space time continuum. But no. I think that's what they wanted me to be doing, but it wasn't happening.","December 8, 2015","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gets you confused on the start. The confusion goes up during the game. Only at the very end will you realize what's this game's story about. Truly unique as far as I'm concerned.\nSTORY: 8/10\n\nThis game is all about puzzles. Some were super easy, following the same pattern you might have discovered in the previous puzzzles. Then there were some which were quite challenging. So, overall a very fun experience. It's quite a shame there aren't some enemies who chase you or something. I'm not that much into walking simulators.\nGAMEPLAY: 8/10\n\nThe graphics were absolutely marvelous! Not really high quality tetures like Witcher 3 or other AAA masterpieces, but it had it's own charm to it. Such a shame I couldn't play it on Ultra settings. A real eye candy really. Plus, it should support VR, so if you got one of those, be sure to try out this game! Beware - if you're playing this game at night, there are some super bright lights which gave made my eyes hurt.\nGRAPHICS: 9/10\n\nThere were some bugs at the time I played this game. I.e. the ball I was carrying was continuosly falling from my "hands" due to lower FPS. It was very frustrating.\nOVERALL: 8/10\n\nP.S. This review was written shortly after I finished the game. Gametime: 3.6 hrs.","December 30, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Got this as part of a humble bundle, and at the time it wasn't available on Mac. Very glad they added Mac support recently and I was able to play it.\n\nThe only downsides are that the controls, collision spheres, and physics could be better. There were many times when the 'spheres' you move around would get stuck on invisible collision, get knocked out of my hand, and then I'd have to chase after it as they rolled down hills. Sometimes they would get stuck on the ground as I tried to move forward on a steep incline. Still though, I appreciate what theses guys tried to do.","February 1","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My ACTUAL playtime would prolly be around the 2 hour mark.\n\nBoiled down to its simplest, "NO, this game is not worth buying & then investing part of your lifespan playing."\n\nIf you would like a few reasons why that is, fine. We are inqusitive creatures by nature.\n\n-Bad script\n--which is then poorly acted\n-Cliched dreamlike settings\n-Puzzles that aren't really puzzles but are more akin to mini-platforming stages that require you to notice things &/or flip switches\n-Infuriating Balls that act as blocks to sit on switches to activate weather mechanics. Why are they so troublesome? BECAUSE THEY ARE BALLS! They roll and BOUNCE and ♥♥♥♥.\n-Weather mechanics that could have been clever but are really just switches to activate particular platforms or doors...ect.\n-Settings that are ENTIRELY TOO LARGE.\n-It froze on me so I uninstalled it out of spite. I'm ok with that since I was only determined to finish it out of spite in the first place.\n\nI do not choose to review lightly.\n\n*edited for a poorly placed comma and changed a "t" to an "s"","January 6","false","36.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, some people may be giving this game a worse review than it deserves because A) They're not playing it in VR, so not getting the atmosphere, B) They're playing it in VR but without a motion platform so they're getting sick. Not criticizing those reviews, just noting it's a bit sad to see this game get a lower score than I would expect from my experience of it.\n\nI recommend getting an Omni to play this (and many other games), so you can turn off the chaperone lines safely, and there is even a way to remove the floor outline for maximum immersion. Here's a video of me playing some of the levels with it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOqRw1tiUO0\n\n\nOverall, this is a must-have title for the HTC Vive.\n\n9/10","June 2","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
