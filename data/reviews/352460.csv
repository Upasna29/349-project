"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CCLsama/recommended/352460/","CCLsama","CCL sama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CCLsama/","79 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDead Realm is a polished spooky hide and seek game combined with some interesting rules.\nThis game is not only focusing on horror! There isn't even a horror tag on it's store page but it's still scary for a lot of people :P\n\nYou will normally start as human and the lucky one will be the ghost. Humans can't attack but they can run and hide. They also have a flashlight, EMF device to determine if the ghost are nearby and see it's aura if it's in invisible mode. They also have the ability to switch into all the different security camera views . The ghost has to catch the players. It also can taunt the players which is a lot of fun!\n\nA big plus in this game is the beautiful leveldesign. There are only 3 maps but they are big and offers a lot of hiding spots! Crates are lying around and can be used to make a hiding spot. A lot of secret areas are on each map which give the human a chance to escape from the ghost :)\n\nThere are two gamemodes:\n\nSeek and ReapThis gamemode is fast paced. The ghost can activate his vision to find humans and stay in invisible mode for a limited time. There is also the double jump which human can't do. Once he reaped a human it will turn into his minion and help him to catch the rest of the group which also can do double jump and detect where humans are.\n\nThe humans are pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed up at this point but luckily they can do more than just run and hide in this gamemode. There are two extra skills in this gamemode. The humans can cast up to 3 invisible shield that will block the ghost for a short time. They can also deploy clones...yes you heard it right! You can go ninja and deploy up to 2 clones each round to confuse the ghost. This gamemode is played mostly in this game but I would recommend the other gamemode to players who like it more stealthy...\n\nBountyThis gamemode is my favourite one. In this gamemode you have to be more careful with your stamina since it will refill very slowly compared to Seek and Reap. The ghost can't double jump nor using his vision to find the survivors but it is invisible forever, can see running survivors through walls and deploy up to 3 banshee's. Those things are like detectors, it is invisible if the survivor doesn't use his EMF device. On contact it will scream, slow down the human and tell the ghost it's location.\n\nThe humans goal in this gamemode is to find 10 watchers to create a portal and escape. If a watcher is nearby, it will play a sound and glow. If the ghost catches one of the humans it will turn into a spectre that can't attack but it can still interact with the world like pressing on buttons, open doors and moving crates around. The main focus in this game is hiding from the ghost and searching for watchers. Walking creates noises so the best strategy is to crouch if a ghost is nearby and find a good hiding spot :) Such tense situation will make your heart race and you will pray that it won't find you :D\n\nConclusionI think I turned my review into a beginner guide lol\nWell, a lot of people compare this game with Damned and IMO the mechanic is a little similar to Damned but much more polished and it is still EA so there will be more surprises in the future :) Definitely worth the full price! Buy it now while it's still hot and support the developers! Thanks for reading :)","August 3, 2015","true","18.8"," 429 of 463 people (93%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","93","429","463","35","8"

While not as expansive as Garrys Mod is now with the maps and such, Dead Realm has the core gameplay down pat, great horror feels, good mechanics and diverse maps keep the fun going, but with only three maps total the hiding spots tend to be the same.\n\nUnfortunately the worst issue is the VOIP system, There is no Push to Talk, and there is no Voice Activation system. The VOIP Chat is reduced to Toggle On/Off, Which means often you'll be in lobbies with young children who are screaming and hollering at every door opening and not knowing their mic is open, Or you get into lobbies where people know this, and still not toggle off and blow your ears out.\n\nStill a fun game, but yea the people suck so buy it with friends or wish for the best.","August 1, 2015","true","8.3"," 301 of 328 people (92%) found this review helpful 72 people found this review funny","92","301","328","72","13"

If I did not know, I would have thought this was the full game with limited maps etc, the game plays so extremely well it is amazing.\nProbably the best indie game out there, without a doubt!\n\nSo with that out of the way, let me get into the details.\n\nAudio: Great atmosphere style tip toes, tapping, noises, screaming (Not just my own), screaches and much more, awesome ingame sound.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are pretty good, they are not know Far Cry 4 but we do not need that. I am completely happy and comfortable saying that the graphics of the game are really good and worth noting.\n\nControls: The controls are surprisingly simple and easy to grasp, you do not need rocket science keys for this game!\n\nThe game itself: Basically think of the game as an adults scary hide and seek (Only mode I done really mattered too me) and everyone hides but one, the ghost too which he looks for people with his special powers, finds someone and turns them into a ghost with them to hunt the remaining players. Simple!\n\nThe game has some amazing little quirkes built in, like multiple hiding places, places in places, hidden places... I am not kidding, you can go through so many levels, behind paintings, through fireplace walls, up and over stuff, under stuff, in stuff, the game has some amazing hiding spots, like a secret stair way in a castle... This game has that type of thing..\n\nIf you can get a full team (4/6/8 Players) all with a microphone then this game shines. The game is pure genious and the only one of it's kind out there. I cannot praise the game enough, just say that Early Access is worth the time and money for such a cheap price, and without a doubt buy the game.\n\nThe ghost can be seen or use a special power to be invisible and that is the scary part, you can be hiding somewhere amazing, hear little pitter patter of baby feat, creapy noises and BOOM, he is right infront of you and got you... Scary and funny when playing with friends.\n\nYes I would recommend this game.","July 31, 2015","true","29.8"," 225 of 246 people (91%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","91","225","246","29","16"

Whether you are a nervous, quaking human hiding in the corner or the malicious, bloodthirsty monster preying on the weak, you will enjoy every second of this game. There are two gamemodes called "Seek and Reap" and "Bounty," and each one is unique.\nIn Seek and Reap, the humans' goal is to remain hidden for the entire time limit without being caught by the monster. They can employ shields and decoys to aid them. If a human is caught by the monster, they are "reaped," meaning they are killed and turned into a spirit. Spirits then aid the monster in hunting the remaining humans. The monster wins if all humans are reaped by the end of the time limit. The humans win if at least one human is alive when time runs out. The ghost can detect the humans' locations and briefly turn invisible to help in slaying the humans.\nBounty is a little different. In Bounty, the humans must find 10 pocket watches within the allotted time, or they lose. Once they find all 10, they must reach a portal to escape. The monster cannot detect the humans in this gamemode, and it remains invisible until it reaps a human. The monster also can summon banshees, which will jumpscare humans and alert the monster to their prescence. Spirits cannot reap in Bounty; all they can do is mess with the environment. Humans cannot use shields or decoys either.\nNo matter which gamemode you play, it is a very fun game and it never gets old. I definitely recommend this game to everyone, especially if you want to play with friends.\n\nPROS AND CONS:\n\nPros:\n-EXCELLENT game to play with friends\n-Not a true-blue horror game, but still tense and very creepy\n-Both gamemodes are unique\n\nCons:\n-Little content (only 3 maps, 2 monsters, and 2 gamemodes), but since it's early access, this is forgivable.\n\n\n","August 1, 2015","true","45.1"," 436 of 521 people (84%) found this review helpful 444 people found this review funny","84","436","521","444","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SyndicateYovi/recommended/352460/","SyndicateYovi","ShadowsFate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SyndicateYovi/","117 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDEAD REALM - Review.\n\nDead Realm is Horror Hide & Seek in a nutshell. You start off either being the ghost/monster or you can be up to 8 players trying to hide from the monster until the time runs down. Naturally this would seem like a copycat to many mods on Gmod that allow a hide and seek type scenario but this is a bit different. In Dead Realm you are faced with strategic abilities that may make or break your chances at survival or dominance in the case of the ghost.\n\nThere are two game modes.\n- Seek & Reap\n- Bounty\nSeek and Reap is basically your basic game of hide & seek, you have a set time limit you have to achieve in order to win whilst being granted 5 special abilities, You can clone yourself 2 times as a human, and use your shield up to 3 times. You can also take full advantage by using a camera monitor system similar to FNAF's. There is a meter in the far right corner that drains battery as you use your camera feature however so only use it in dire situations.\nAs the monster you have the ability to go invisible for a shirt period of time as it drains your stamina bar, you can also see through walls and find red heat signatures that show human players nearby or far away. If a ghost reaps a player, that player becomes an enemy ghost and will be able to reap other players.\n\nBounty mode - Bounty is a bit different where it's a basic game of Find the clues, escape whilst also being chased by a bloodthirsty ghost. In this mode, the players are tasked finding pocket watches left by the millionaire " Mr. Huxley " who according to the lore of the game murdered his wife and child and was either overtaken by darkness or left his mansion. You are tasked to find 10 watches left by Huxley all while avoiding reaping from the ghosts of his manor. (1 ghost) in the end of the game you are to run to a portal to escape the mansion, all while still being hunted. The ghost can see you but he has lower stamina and he cannot turn the souls he reaps into evil ghosts either.\n\nMultiplayer - The multiplayer gaming system is peer to peer which always means, the people with the better internet reign supreme. This is bad because it causes major desynchs at times and major errors such as " YOU ARE BANNED " which has happened to me quite a lot.\n\nPROS -\n\n-  Unique atmospheric multiplayer horror game\n- Fun with friends\n- Creative mechanics\n- New horror concept (Kind-of)\n- Music is similar to a mix of Skyrim & Dead Island.\n- Good User Interface\n- Places to hide, unique locations\n\n- CONS\n\n- Peer to Peer Multiplayer gaming\n- Limit of monsters and locations\n- Two game modes (Both fun however)\n- Basic multiplayer jump scare type game (Unique but could be darker and more ominous)\n\n\nREPLAY VALUE - 8.4/10 - I'd play this only with friends or if I want to stream or record, or if I'm feeling a bit bored.\n\nFINAL VERDICT - 7.9/10 - VERY GOOD\n\nIt's not often I say this about horror games since this technically isn't a horror game it's simply a multiplayer hide & seek horror aspect put into it. I will say this is a good game with loads of potential and I'm hoping the developers consider the possibilities in the near future and listen to some of the fan suggestions.\n\n\nI recommend getting this game if you'd like to scare or get scared by your friends.\n","August 16, 2015","true","89.4"," 112 of 118 people (95%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","95","112","118","9","0"

I spent a night playing this game with one my friends and honestly it's going to be a hit and miss for some people. that's for sure.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are simple and can be compared to a slightly better version of GMOD but there is still definitely a creepy atmosphere regardless of the quality. I am running everything on ultra and I haven't found anything visually damaging to my eyes.\n\nMechanics: The current game mechanics are all working pretty well, there are some things which feel a little clunky such as the doors but this is a very minor issue. You can enjoy a game with your friends or even strangers without any frustating problems. Note: There is no text chat feature currently which means the only way to talk is via mic.\n\nAnimations: Jump scare animations are quite good, besides that a new animation set could be in order. The current one is fine but I believe they can do much better at a later date.\n\nGameplay: This is where the hit and miss really comes in. For me, I can scare quite easily on horror games, although some people can't. That being said, I've known my friends to scream often at this game. This is a sort've cross between GMOD Hide n Seek and possibly Slender. (Especially Bounty game mode) The maps are pretty extensive and it's very easy to get lost. There are a lot of hidden doors, passageways and what not. The biggest fear factor of this game is that the enemy is human controlled and you never know when you're going to get jump scared. That being said, I do reccommend this game with friends and not for sole players looking for 'serious' games.\n\nOverall score 8/10, there is room for improvement but things are on a pretty good solid foundation so it should only be up from here ^^","July 30, 2015","true","2.2"," 234 of 318 people (74%) found this review helpful 174 people found this review funny","74","234","318","174","4"

On launch, it's a good early access. There's some optimization to be done, and the walking animation is a bit goofy, but the three maps they have currently are all very fun, expansive, & detailed. The two monsters are different and interesting and mix-up how you play, as do the two game modes (the first game mode is basically similar to a Damned/Slender, you need to collect 10 stop watches while the monster is invisible except for on your phone, the second is an 'infection' mode where the monsters kill humans, who turn into malicious spirits to kill more humans).\n\nYou can play in a lobby with between 2-8 people, the lobbies are good, don't need to forward ports and hosting is easy, along with some good customization in the lobby for things like time, rounds, etc.\n\nGame is good for a few rounds or hours, but the concept is executed well. I found it less scary and more exciting and fun with some really tense and clutch moments. Both modes out feel different and change the tone of rounds considerably. This game will be made or broke by support to the title, I can see this being a real gem of a multiplayer horror game if they add more maps/monsters/modes at a pretty steady rate, what's there now is quite fun and the seven friends I played with and myself all enjoyed it.\n\nWhile I personally don't find it hugely scary, I did find it a lot of fun, tense, and I did have panic moments when a monster was on my tail or if I was hiding and hoping to god they wouldn't spot or sense me.\n\nTL;DR - Game is fun, content there currently is fun, needs more of it but a very good Day 1 Early Access, has some kinks but nothing game-breaking, this is a good pick-up-and-play game that is good for a few hour sessions every once in a while, and with more content could get addicting. Look forward to see what it becomes.","July 30, 2015","true","8.1"," 75 of 84 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","75","84","6","0"

Sure, why not, £10 is not a lot of money these days and I feel theres easily hours of fun to be had in the state the game is in now and once new updates come out with more content you will certainly find yourself coming back to the game. Even as it is now you will find yourself coming back for a quick game or two as it's not a huge time sink.\n\nSo long as the game gets new content and the support it deserves I feel Dead Realm will have a very bright future, like I said though, so long as it does get updated and not fall into the catagory of other EA titles that never get updated.","August 5, 2015","true","3.8"," 58 of 62 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","58","62","7","0"

I bought into damned back when that first started kicking around for two reasons. First there were not many successful game studios in that part of the world and this seemed like a good start for an alpha stage, secondly because I wanted to see this mechanic done right. Sadly, as so often is the case when risking money on an alpha the production of content slowed to a crawl and game-breaking bugs lingered and stagnated; eventually destroying the very supportive playerbase.\n\nAt the time my reaction was "I wish a better run, more solid studio would take this idea and run with it", "I wish this game was more attractive, had atmosphere and solid performance", "this game would be great if it didnt constantly disconnect or lose party members". etc. etc.\n\nWell not long after I had given up on the idea out pops the shiny, polished and rounded Dead Realm. Marvellous game with a good bit of content, fantastically atmospheric maps and lots of little details that just tie the whole experience together; such as taunting as a monster and the use of sound to help you survive.\n\nThe great thing about this game is there isnt really any game breaking bugs, the game itself is solid as a rock! Now, before the community have got to the point of asking, the developers have leapt into creating new maps, modes and tweaking the game for an improved experience. It is for the magnificent game and the effort of the developers to ensure their consumers are happy that I recommend this game. 100%","October 3, 2015","true","8.6"," 81 of 98 people (83%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","83","81","98","8","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddicarus/recommended/352460/","Paddicarus","ReOL ☯","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddicarus/","59 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI have only had it for a few days, but the results were great; this game has a lot of potential for the future seeing that it has the perfect gloomy atmosphere and the right tone of music for a tense + suspenseful kind of game. When your right in the mood and get caught the jumpscares are perfect, but of course once you see it enough you'll start expecting it and then it won't be as enticing... However when you know you have to run because of the identification of the ghost near you, it certainly gets your heart beating; you sometimes don't know when to stop or turn because things are happening so quickly and gets more and more uproaring as you find ways to juke the ghost.\n\nThere are a wide selection of players to choose from such as Grace, Edgar and others (even though that doesn't change the gameplay) plus once your friends get this game with you it becomes a ton more fun, no longer will you suffer from YouTuber fans who always bug and talk about the Famous Gamers and no longer will you find glitch-walling hackers or Jackasses who block the doorways for both you and the ghost (This means the ghost starts targeting you as both are blocked from another player)\nYou also have special abilities each round, for both ghost and human. Humans have a special bubble shield that once activated the ghosts cannot reap you, although it is temporary it should give you enough time to escape, as well as that you can also place decoys, 2 to be maximum, so you can fool the ghosts and spirits whilst the true you is running away trying to find a new hiding spot. However, for the ghosts you have double jump which is of course easier to capture the humans when they are above in high places and when right-clicking you enable a human-seeking mode which where-ever a human is hiding a red spot is detected, once you are close enough it shall warn you about it giving you the oppotunity to capture them, the only problem that occurs is the fact that when using sprint and the human-seeking ability it does take away your stamina, meaning you need to walk for a little bit whilst doing it again which does give the opposite player an advantage at times... Oh and another thing, as a ghost you can also Press "R" to activate Invisibility so the players can't see where you are coming from, this also takes stamina but in my opinion makes a giant advantage, especially when you crouch at the same time making you more silent.\n\nWhat I've been talking about in the past paragraph was specifically "Seek n' Reap" mode, so let's get onto the second game mode which is called "Bounty". In this you have a much more suspenseful and tense effect because the only safe thing you can do is walk slowly or crouch, if you run the ghost can detect you immediately leaving you to drop into a spiritual doom, you also have the disadvantage as a human seeing you can't use any of your abilities in Bounty Mode, all you can do to be securely safe is Crouch, Walk, Flashlight and Scanner (Scanner allows you to detect if the ghost / spirits are nearby, it should say when a face starts appearing, the clearer the face is the closer the ghost / spirit is, it also allows you to switch to different cameras using the "Z and X" Keys so you can see which room the Ghost is in.)\nYou also have to collect 10 Watches, once you do so a portal will open up giving you the chance to escape, if you do so I am sure you will feel a hint of satisfaction and calmness ease into you.\n\nMy overall opinion in this game is outstanding, but let me list a few things that could be added / improved seeing that this of course is only an early alpha and shall be getting updated a lot quite soon.\nFirst off, there should be more maps: Even though this seems like an obvious one and more would predictably be made, there are only 3 at the moment, one being incredibly popular and good, another being slightly worse seeing you can't escape in any of the fire places but does have other great hiding spots and one that is tiny as hell and in my opinion is quite crap.\nSecond off, Allow humans to pass through other's shields: When using a shield not only does it block a ghost but another human as well, this gives a disadvantage to other players because all it does is set the ghost on them instead of the original person they were going for, if they allowed other players to pass through I feel like it would make everything much more fair and well-played, same goes for decoys.\nThirdly, Add more spirit playermodels: All we know at the moment is that once you turn into a spirit, whether originally being a human male or female, you always turn into a male spirit; and in my opinion that needs to be fixed due to the fact that it makes it less realistic and more weird, all they basically have to do is re-texture all the original human playermodels with the colours and that but I am sure they will do something like that soon enough.\nFouth and Final, Things I probably missed out: Many know that there are glitches such as falling through elevator floors and invisible balconies as well as being reaped through the bubbles and teleporting ghost bugs etc. but as expected, this is an early alpha that isn't even beta yet so we'll just have to wait for the outcomes of what updates happen in the future... I've probably missed out quite a few other things but I can't care right now, I did this at a late time and I'm tired as hell.\n\nOverall Opinion: 9/10\n*Few glitches and improvements needed\n*More needs to be added\n*Great atmosphere and mood\n*Gives perfect tension and the scare at times\n*Has quite good hiding places in "Reap n' Seek"\n- Recommend this best when it fully comes out or at least when it turns to beta.","August 2, 2015","true","29.4"," 67 of 79 people (85%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","85","67","79","8","0"

You're able to use supernatural powers to be given hints as to where the enemy is. You can also be invisible, which is pretty cool. As a human, you can drop decoys and place a bubble around yourself, as to divert the ghost. The jumps are pretty decent, and this mode is REALLY fun to play with friends and generally scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of each other.\n\nIn 'Bounty', you attempt to find 10 'watches', as a human, at which point a portal will open and you can escape.

So far there are only two game modes - 'Bounty' and 'Seek and Reap'. In Bounty, the humans have to try find 10 hidden pocket watches while the ghost tries to hunt the humans. Personally, I love how as a spirit in the bounty mode, you can just explore the map and interact with surroundings - gives you the chance to find a new spot for the next round >:] Seek and Reap on the other hand is a little more simple, with the basic element of survival - hide until the time's up. Unlike the bounty mode, humans who have been caught and turrned into spirits can help the ghost find other humans. The game is very straightforward, making it easy to get accustomed to the game and can be enjoyed for hours due to the simple desire to try find the best hiding spots and strategies - a few of which I have discovered myself and I bet you can't get me on the Fireside map >:]\nBut in all seriousness, the game is definitely worth the money and great fun, especially when you get to talk to the other players - giving the game more suspense and getting some funny moments and reactions from giving someone a jump-scare.\n\nIdeas:\nThe only thing that I believe need fixing is the mouse sensitivity and for additions to the game it would be great to have an in-game typing chat since some people either prefer to type or don't have a mic or whatever. Also, I think it would create a slightly more scary environment if some of the paintings were animated at random times or when you walk nearby (e.g. eyes following you) or if the statue of Huxley itself could be animated in some way - tbh, Huxley might even be a good additional 'ghost', giving players an extra choice. Since all I can tell from my experience so far, however limited it may be, is that the ghosts only have audio and visual differences, maybe it would be interesting to implement special abilities for each ghost - for example, if the wolf could sniff out the humans or if the baby could place a baby doll or something down as some sort of scare trap. Just random ideas. Perhaps that would make it more interesting and maybe even make certain ghosts better on certain maps, allowing for player strategies to develop.\nI also noticed that the ghosts talk when you press 't' but the humans do not, maybe that could be changed so that humans can taunt?\nThat's all I've got... for now.","July 30, 2015","true","4.5"," 51 of 59 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","51","59","4","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyTenjoin/recommended/352460/","LadyTenjoin","LadyTenjoin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyTenjoin/","983 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDead Realm is an indie multiplayer “horror” game. Gameplay consists of a hide and seek system, with one person as the “ghost” and the rest as humans. The humans and the ghost characters have different types of abilities that if used properly, could capture and reap (the ghost’s skills), or evade and fend off the threat (human’s skills). As with any multiplayer game, Dead Realm is best played with friends so if you got some buddies, poke and command them to buy the game and play with you. If joining a public lobby, up to 8 players can join.\n\nTruthfully, I didn’t play around with Baby William or the Wolfman because I wanted to be the one getting scared so I only know a little bit of how the ghosts works. Despite that, I will list my observations during my time as a human and as a ghost.\n\nAs a human, there are various hiding spots that sometimes can be reached via platforming sections and knowing the locations of these hiding spots in each map will hinder the ghost from finding its prey. Checking the cameras for the ghost’s location once in awhile will prolong the human’s life but they cannot linger in the cameras too long since they are vulnerable and the ghost will take this chance and reap their soul. Amongst the human’s arsenal, they can create decoys of themselves, which can distract the enemy momentarily and a barrier, which is effective if activated in front of the door during a chase because if a ghost is following, the person can simply pop that barrier up and slow down their assailant. These are useful tools to have but they are not infinite so a smart human will use them wisely. The humans are also equipped with an EVP recorder, which allows the detection of a nearby ghost so keeping an eye on this device is imperative for their survival.\n\nThe Ghosts have the means of catching its prey by hearing and seeing their heartbeats(?). They can also taunt and tease its prey out of hiding. Additionally, the ghosts can also cloak themselves. Timing the use of the cloaking skill is important. Lastly, one similarity that the humans and ghost posses is the energy bar. Running and using abilities will take a portion of the energy bar so it’s best to keep an eye on it.\n\nThere are 2 game modes for now. Bounty and Seek & Reap. It’s a standard find the human, save the world…I mean, the ghost’s job is to search for the humans and reap them. All the humans need to do is survive and avoid the ghost until the timer runs out. Pretty simple. I haven’t played Bounty as much but basically humans need to collect 10 pocket watches so that they can escape and the ghosts, of course, must prevent them from collecting the watches.\n\nFor an early access game, it is playable, with little drops in framerate and enjoyable gameplay. The graphics is decent enough. I was a bit disappointed that I barely got a scare out of the game. I was looking forward to that. I joined several random games, thinking that one will get me but nothing. I played with a few friends, and by then, I’ve gotten used to the game. For me…I repeat, in my opinion, the Wolfman is not scary (Granted, if a wolfman is chasing me in real life, I would just freak out and probably hide in the corner, bawling like a child) and the bloodied baby, William, looks really cute, man. How the heck is he scary? He’s so cute, yes he is! *ahem*\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=495710939\n\nWhat I really want is that grud…gru…the lady from that Grudge movie (I cringe every time I remember that movie. I still have PTSD from that movie) or similar to it. I want her crawling and making those unnatural sounds. Oh that would be a dream.\n\nAnd please, wear headphones and turn that volume up. The atmosphere can get unsettling for new players and the ambient sounds are not too shabby. Although, now that I think about it, there is a mic chat in-game (push to talk) and if you got people squealing in your ears, I won’t blame you if you turn the volume down (but there is a slider for the VC, which I am grateful for).\n\nAll in all, it’s a pretty good game and a fun distraction. I can’t see myself playing it for long periods of time but hey it’s a fun twist to a favorite children’s game. I recommend it. 14.99 is a reasonable price. The developers are actively patching the game and they seem responsive to their player base.\n\nHere’s me fooling around in Dead Realm with some friends. Watch it at your time.

Think of what Damned wanted to be, and multiply it by 11. No weapons. No ways to directly combat the demons. Dead Realm has grasped what players have wanted in a multiplayer hide-and-seek survival horror game. From giggling like a little girl as a ghost while you taunt friends and strangers alike, to shaking unendingly and whispering for your friends as a human, Dead Realm is a truly terrifying experience that should not be missed out on, especially for fans of the survival horror genre.

Hide and Seek games is something that the game industry lacked. Now that Dead Realm is here i feel i can safely say that I (as a gamer) am hugely satisfied with the Hide and Seek genre because Dead Realm has all the basics you want in a Hide and Seek game. Not to mention its early access so it is bound to be shaped in the way that everyone wants it to be!\n\nIs Dead Realm a scary game?\n\nYes and No. Dead Realm is scary to an extent. I would say you get more thrills from playing than you would a terrifying feeling that someone is watching you. However that doesent make it any less of a game. The tension of hiding from a monster and hoping that you wont be found is intense. You genuinly feel your heart begin to race and your fingers become clumsy as you look around for the creature. The thrills increase even more when you are trying to escape the monsters clutches! (i would also reccomend using headphones and increasing volume on them, just for the extra excitement!)\n\nDo I need friends to play Dead Realm?\n\nThe game is better with friends i admit, however it is still incredibly fun with random people. The only point i would make on this question though is that it is a LOT funner if you have a usable mic. Being able to talk with the other survivors and hear them scream as they get caught is one of the best things about the game. However there is one thing i will say, this game needs more people! I feel as though Dead Realm doesent get the attention it should have. A multiplayer game needs its people, so please do tag along for the ride.\n\nIs the game fair for both seekers and hiders?\n\nIt all depends on the persons skill. Neither side is more handicapped than the other. What i comes down to is whether or not you have the skill to survive or reap. Survivers are equipped with decoys to delude the monsters as well as shields they can deploy to escape from the monsters if being chased. On the other other hand the monsters have a double jump ability, a human sensing ability (the humans also have something similar for the monsters) and best of all an invisibility ability which makes the jumpscares all the more intense!\nNote: Only the starting monster has the ability to go invisble.\n\nIs it worth buying this game now?\n\nYes yes and YES. Early access or not this game is too much fun to just pass up on. The pricing is more than worth it for a game that you will eventually receive even more on!\n\nSo hurry up people, find some time to come along and hunt or be hunted on Dead Realm!\n\n10/10 would reap again","July 31, 2015","true","8.0"," 38 of 45 people (84%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","84","38","45","8","0"

I think none. Well, now add a horror setting, characters from jumpscare and all multiplayer gameplay: you come off a mixture of fun and fear that we can summarize in the new early access title "Dead Realm".\nWe assume that Dead Realm is still a game in development. However, the developers seek to criticise the game players and help them in developing, adding more monsters, more maps, more modes. At the time, Dead Realm is very limited, but everything is justified by a fun gameplay and scary at the same time. The "scenario" of the game is given to us by the description of Steam: a wealthy Tycoon, William Huxley, probably after an ira attack, killing or kills his entire family and all his employees at his villa. Simple, huh? While playing "hide-and-seek" by Dead Realm, in fact, we can be chosen or as fugitives, or as a ghost, which will hunt humans. The ghosts are, at least for now, the little son of Tycoon "William", his right-hand man, "Wolfman", or a sort of butchers, "Butcher". There are currently three maps: a library, with an area of boilers and furnaces, and a slaughterhouse. All these locations are designed with retail locations and secrets hidden passages to help (not just) players to escape from the ghosts.\n\nGRAPHICS:\n\nThe graphics of Dead Realm doesn't shout to the miracle: However, the developers were able to reconstruct the horror atmosphere that inspires AWE, fear, frenzy. A few graphics bugs. Great "jumpscare" effects with the camera that frames the ghost when you are caught.\n\nAUDIO:\n\nDead audio Realm is all focused on anxiety reason. When caught, for example, the sound that will be played there will literally jump. Music almost non-existent. Nice sound effects for the environment.\n\nCOMMENT:\n\nAlthough in Early Access, Dead Realm is gaining much Steam users, myself included. The secret of the game lies in the fact that it is both enjoyable pad in hand, it's fun watching videos or games online. There is tension, feels and, especially, can be really hilarious (or a nightmare). Few players, little content, all justified by its state of development. Highly recommended.\n","November 8, 2015","true","135.5"," 36 of 44 people (82%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","82","36","44","6","0"

I was absolutely wrong.\n\nAlthough I only have 1.2 hours at the making of this review, I can tell you that this game is actually extremely fun and suprisingly scary. Obviously due to the game's alpha state it isn't the best looking of the horror franchise, but just the fact that it has multiplayer capabilites and it can actually give quite a scare (especially when a ghost sneaks up on you) I definetely recommend this to all friends and anyone who enjoys horror games.

It's fun and entertaining but there are a few issues with it. Without friends, the game is slightly dull but that can be made up by talking to other players in the game itself, if they have a headset. Sadly, however, my headset does not seem to work on the game despite my ability to hear other players through my headset. Another issue that I have found with the game is that there are few servers to join, most of the servers are locked, unless you constantly refresh the game and, even then, you might not find a server you like.\n\nThe game is very spooky and when the ghosts come out of nowhere to reap you, you will scream like a little girl and sometimes cry. (I have never cried!) I know I've only mentioned the negatives in this post, as they are the primary thing hurting my gameplay, but there are plenty of positives such as the paranoia, jump scares, controls, and all around entertainment associated with this game.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone considering buying it. I will update this post when I play more into the game. I just thought to, currently, give my opinions on the issues I am having.\n\n----\n\nIn my 2 hours of gameplay, I've found that more people are having the same issues with headset compatability as I am and that it is not just me. There are still plenty of people who do talk in-game as well so there is no lack of sociality in the game itself. What I find this game still needs is an in-game typing system so people without headsets could still communicate with others. There are some lag issues considering it is a peer to peer connection but, other than those things, the game is still good.\n\nContinuing on with the review. I will simply say that I continue to recommend it as it is even more fun than I thought from my 1.2 hours post. I would never consider refunding my money. Time goes by so fast because of the paranoia in the game and how quick the rounds go by. Needless to say, I screamed like a little girl when I was reaped, on several ocassions, and nearly cried due to being chased by six spirits. The maps are very extensive and have several hundred places to hide, which is amazing, but sometimes getting to them is annoying. Even though I haven't played a lot yet, I've found so much fun in the game itself that I'm still finding new places to hide especially when you're running for your life. Being the spirit is a bit complicating and gets fairly annoying at the beginning but it does get easier the more you play, just like any game.\n\nMany people bought this game due to Vanoss's, and his friend group's, videos and mention of it but I was skeptical. It seemed as if this game could get dull fast but it seems to be impressing me so far with its constant paranoia and ever-changing chases. The game currently has 3 maps and 2 game modes, all of which are well made. Seek and Reap is a Hide and Seek game mode and Bounty is an objective based game mode, both of which are highly entertaining and completely different from each other.\n\nAgain, I recommend this game to anyone who is considering buying it. I fought my skepticism to buy it and it was the best $15 I spent in a long while. I will continue with my review based on the more time I spend on the game. (Sorry if this seems sloppy, I'm not really thinking of what to write, just writing what I feel about the game.)","August 10, 2015","true","4.4"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","90","28","31","10","0"

With The Forest, Stranded Deep, and H1Z1 in my game library I have found that most early access games are released too broken therefore turning you off to the game entirely or making you think that the development team is short on cash. Dead Realm however seems to be the most complete early access game that I have ever played. It has very little glitches or problems that I have experienced throughout my game play.\n\nThe gameplay is great! Playing with friends is awesome as well as just joining a random lobby. Seek and Reap is in my opinion the most fun because of the chaos that can be created by shortening prep time, extending play time, and adding more players. Bounty is a great game mode that reminds me a lot of Slenderman. You have to walk around the map looking for watches that spawn pretty much anywhere on the map as the always invisible ghost hunts your team down. This mode offers more scares then Seek and Reap, but is harder to actually complete. All in all both game modes are amazing. The scare factor in the game is fully dependent on the skill of the other players. Are you going to get scared every time you get caught? No, but there are times where you get very much caught off guard and sent flying into the air.\n\nThings to improve would obviously be bug fixes, but as I said before there seems to be very little of them. Adding game modes, maps, and playable humans are a must and I've already heard that this is in the works. Upgraded servers or some way to lower pings for players would be another must. I have mostly hosted my own severs, but when I do play on some others my ping can be a little too high causing the game to lag just a little bit to much. Knowing who is talking is another thing that I would love to see added but isn't a must. My suggestions on a new ghost would be a Clown, map would be a haunted/abandon school or church, and for human characters it should be the YouTubers who creatively designed the game.","August 4, 2015","true","189.6"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","27","30","4","0"

After the first couple of jumps it lost its 'fear factor' and became more of a game of tag than a scary version of hide & seek. (Ironically enough this was especially the case of the actual hide and seek gamemode as the ghost could see easily locate you so there was no hiding). The other gamemode I thought was very interesting but the stopwatches you needed to locate were near impossible to find within the time limit, especially with dwindling numbers as the ghosts caught up with you.\n\nHaving said that it was a good fun for the first couple of games.

Well, it's a darn sight better than Damned thus far, not least of all given the fact that there's no third-party "account" which you can be indefinitely locked out of just because you changed computers (if any Damned devs are reading this, you really are a pack of charlatan ♥♥♥♥-suckers).  It's also a darn sight more COMPLETE than Spectre, so perhaps this game will have the fine privilege of being the first of this recent rash of first-person, stealth-based multiplayer horror games to actually reach COMPLETION?!  We can only hope so.  Or, in firmer words:  We can only hope that THESE particular devs don't bail out on their game, as those of the two aforementioned products appear to have.  They certainly have the BONES of a good ghostie game here.\n\nNow, in the past I've by-and-largely badmouthed competitive multiplayer games, and I'm afraid this isn't going to be the game to completely change my tune.  Already I can see many of the hallmarks/problems inherent with such formats.  Firstly, there doesn't seem to be any kind of tutorial, and the "how-to-play" pages are a little vague at best.  Basically you have little choice but to launch straight into a game and work it out from there, and even a mere couple of days into the game's release there already appear to be people who've worked out "exploits" which make it nigh-impossible to beat them (on both the side of the humans AND the ghosts).  One lot who had a lobby up had even named their group "Skilled Players", so yessiree, the elitism has already kicked in.  Two days post-release, and if you only just bought the game, you're already a despicable "noob"!  Oh, the wonders of the internet era.  Truly the Age of Aquarius is upon us:  Everyone hold hands and sing, and we'll gladly kick your teeth in, for the cardinal sin of not being quite as good at a VIDEO GAME as me and me mates are.  ♥♥♥♥IN' NOOBS!!!\n\nThis is all just par for the course where competitive multiplayer games are concerned, of course, so if you've ever been part of such a community, you know what you're in for.  Having said all that, this is looking like it may actually be one of the BETTER competitive games out there, and as I say, it's by far the best attempt I've seen so far at a genuinely "scary" one (sorry, Left 4 Dead...I do love you, but "scary" just isn't a word which fits).  Just how "scary" it will be for the peeps who become unbeatable uber-masters at it I can't rightly say, but let's leave any debates about how successful a multiplayer horror game could possibly ever be for another forum, and just conclude that if even the remote possibility of such an ambitious idea ACTUALLY WORKING is of interest to you, this game is looking like the most promising prospect thereabouts.   It definitely shows potential, and is already quite playable in its current form.  Which, in itself, is something of a miracle.  It also has some very nice ideas, like those humans who are "reaped" by the ghosts joining the ranks of the undead.  And it currently has at least two quite different game "modes" and a few different maps, which is nice.  Quite how much longevity it'll have for me in the long run, I can't rightly say, but I'm certainly not "over" it just yet.  For many others out there, though, this may be just what you've been waiting for...all in all, a pretty fun and spooky little effort, and one to keep a (bloodshot) eye on.\n\nVerdict: 8/10.","July 31, 2015","true","3.2"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","24","33","4","0"

It does remind me a bit of Damned, but a much more polished and better version. I do like their maps and the overall gameplay.\n\nSomething I do wish would happen would be a much clearer version of the lore and also some ghost and human variation. What we understand as the players is that around a century ago, this "electricity tycoon" murdered his family and staff. The ghosts that are playable were murdered by him in a terrible fashion. Something I'd like to know more about is how, and what the playable murdered characters were like in maybe like a box with their biography or something (similar to Killing Floor 2 or something of the sort) rather than just hearing the same newscasts over the radios spread throughout the maps. Right now, all the characters in the game are like empty suits for you to just wear. There is no real established character to make you care much about them at all. The ghosts all do the same things making them more like a skin rather than an established character.\n\nIf they all had like some kind of special power along with its own weakness (perhaps relating to the ghost's character like if Baby William had the ability to go much quicker and see better but grows weaker around pictures of his father or the broadcasts over the radio relating to the crime) similar to Damned rather than being a kind of skin.\n\nThe humans as well would be interesting to have biographies giving them personality rather than just being a skin chosen by the player's preference on looks. Also another idea would be spirit variation in the looks (Ex: if Becky dies, she becomes a spirit looking like herself rather than that of a male spirit) and also making female sound effects for when the female characters jump and such.\n\nOverall, I really do like this game and I think that with just a little bit of polishing, it could make one of the best. :)","September 14, 2015","true","33.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","0"

I heard of it through Vanoss and luck to him just that its not fun when you have 1 friend to play wih or even 2. Now for the server browser... its emty, yup there is no one, the reason for this is that there are no servers, only player hosted servers also its region locked meaning you cannot play with people who are much further than you the limit is about 100 ping I think so if you live in Europe or America your good, buy the game but if ur playing with poeple who are not in the most populated area like South Africa (where I say) then save ur cash buy cs:go, insurgency or gmod instead, now I have already refunded this game, me and my friend played it but there are only 3 maps and not a real `hiding` aspect to it. But i`ll give it some slack since its newly released.\n\nSo I rate u dont get this game until it can guarantee that poeple will be playing, there will be international servers/Dedicated servers that you can join and some more maps and gamemodes characters etc. The day that  happens I will repurchase this game but for now, its your choice!","September 1, 2015","false","0.7"," 42 of 68 people (62%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","62","42","68","5","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/femboyancy/recommended/352460/","femboyancy","♥Prince Vaxi♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/femboyancy/","510 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI have bad experiences with games like this.\n\nTake Depth for example...Two players play as sharks...Four players play as human divers...Looks amazing on the surface, lots of awesome trailers, lots of fantastic screenshots.\nBut then the game itself is honestly a glitchy, buggy mess that is COMPLETELY impossible and pointless to immerse yourself in when some idiot from Russia decides it's a good idea to play on a North American server and have 500 Ping, glitching all over the map like a tiger shark hyped up on coffee meant for The Flash.\n\n\n...Dead Realm takes that game genre, and does so many things right, that it doesn't matter.\nThe important thing is to not take Dead Realm as a 'realistic survival horror'. That's not the point. Take it more like a game of Pacman with a multiplayer function. That's much more like what Dead Realm aims for.\n\n\nGameplay\nFirst of all, I need to stress again, that this game needs to be taken with a huge chunk of salt. It is not a picture perfect game with flawless graphics and deep, intense controls where you create weapons or struggle in a melee fight with the monster etc. etc. It's a cat & mouse game, end of story.\n\nThere are several game types to choose from:\n\nSeek & Reap\nThe standard game type. A server can hold up to 8 players total, where 1 is always the monster, and 7 are humans. The job for the humans in this game is to survive for a Host-decided amount of time without getting caught by the monster. Naturally, the monster's job is a polar opposite; kill every human within the time limit. To assist them, humans come equipped with 'shields' and 'decoys'. Shields create a spherical bubble which anyone, humans and monsters alike, cannot pass through, except the one who created it. This is a good way to block a monster's ability to chase you for long enough for you to flee and find a hiding spot. Decoys are an exact replica of the player's character, but it cannot move. When a monster tries to caputer it, it'll simply vanish. One last weapon for humans, is their Ghost Tracker app, which can be used by right clicking. This works similarly to the monster's tracking ability, letting you know only when a monster is nearby by making scary faces and noises.\nMonsters get a unique bonus depending on the monster chosen. From double jumping, to faster sprinting, to situational speed boosts. All monsters come equipped with a location sensor, providing them with temporary bubbles on the map to locate enemies. This bubble vanishes when in close proximity, forcing the monster to rely solely on sight to finally locate the human.\nWhen a human is captured, they turn into a Ghost. Ghosts assist the monster, chasing humans and being able to do everything the monster can do, short of their special monster-specific ability. They can, however, still track humans, but can only run at human speeds.\n\nBounty\nA slightly harder game type. Humans are unable to use shields or decoys unlike in Seek & Reap, and monsters are invisible. Additionally, ghosts are spectres instead, and cannot capture humans like in S&R. Instead they are invisible, and can only manipulate things like doors and ventilation grates. It is each spectre's choice whether to help the monster, or the humans.\nThe humans' job is to avoid the invisible monster, while searching for 10 pocket watches. Once 10 have been found, a portal opens somewhere on the map. Every human who stands in the portal will be uncapturable, and win the game.\n\nHardcore Bounty\nSame as bounty, but with crippling handicaps for both sides, such as the Ghost Tracker app's battery does not recharge. Monsters cannot sprint, etc. etc.\n\n\nThe game is still new, and only comes with a small handful of monsters, and with three or four maps.\n\n\nGraphics\nThe game's major drawback. Graphics are a bit out dated and not really that impressive. Then again, this game's focus is on gameplay and sound, not graphics, thus decreasing its quality. Still nice enough to give a very spooky world to creep around in, though! But no, it's not eye candy.\n\nSound\nAce in the hole. Seriously. The sounds in this game makes up about 40% of the entire experience. My heart rate barely went up when I 'SAW' the monster, and knew it was chasing me...But when I was standing inside a closet...And hearing that monster's feet thumping around in the room with me, searching for my hiding spot, my heart was ready to jump out of my chest. It's such a simple little detail, but it makes the game go from a 5/10, to an 8/10 for me.\n\n\nConclusion\nIf you're into horror games, and got some friends to play with, or if you're simply a social gamer who likes to interact with his or her fellow players? Then this game is made for you, specifically. It is a fantastic game, and once you get over the fact that there's no eye-candy to look at in the game, and simply take the game for what it is? You'll be very pleasantly surprised.\nAdditionally, the community is Grade A material, if my experiences are any indication of general truth. I've met two good friends through it already, and nobody seems to be inherently rude, unlike in games like CS:GO where you can't really do anything beneficial to your progress without provoking the enraged frustration from some 12 year old with anger issues.\nDefinitely recommended.","November 3, 2015","true","3.4"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","82","14","17","6","4"

I do like this game but I can't give it a positive review because of its upkeep. I don't know how their team is handling it, but it seems that their developpers are wether inexistant or slackers. Last update added a lot of new textures, models, UI overhaul which is nice, however after 3 month of updates there is still no new gameplay features. Nothing. Perhaps they just have no idea what to do because all they do is taking the 2 first gamemodes and tweak them a bit to give "new gamemodes", which is ridiculous to be honest.\n\nNow you can interpret their behavior as you wish, but an early access game with this development speed definitly gives something to worry about.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI'm usually not posting any review but this needs to be said.\n\nTL;DR: Devs are just mocking us.

Let me explain.\n\nWhile the game has an interesting gameplay, it obviously lacks a lot of content, but it's still ok though because of how early it is. Well, it would be if devs actually managed to do useful updates. At the moment I'm writing this review, there has been one "update" within over a month, which added 2 "new" gamemodes.\nTo quote their post about it they "worked hard" to release those gamemodes "highly asked" by the community. In fact, it is just the 2 basic gamemodes with 3 ♥♥♥♥ing variables modified, not kiding. I am myself a developer and could only laugh at this, they took 3 weeks to release a gamemode copying the first one with just a greater speed and more protection, nothing actually new.\n\nOh and of course the community never asked for these.\nThere are also a lot of unbalances and exploits in the game that the community asks to be fixed (which would also take less than an hour to tweak)\n\nAlso, they could have released dedicated servers to make the game much more playable but instead left it to be peer-to-peer which gives insane ping, regionlock and a small playerbase.\n\nSo now you have an idea on how the game is being handled. The lack of content could also be fixed by a workshop since it's only a matter of gamemode/maps/models.\n\nTo sum up, this game is doomed unless they release dedicated servers and workshop which is, at this state, rather unlikely.","October 3, 2015","false","29.6"," 167 of 297 people (56%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","56","167","297","28","11"

You have the ability to summon 2 decoys per round and pop 3 shield bubbles to aid you in your escape.

Little did we know that we were about to have 8 to 10 mini heart attacks over the next hour. After we both installed we were very egar to play seeing as this game looks like it had potential to be great...and it delivered. I made a private game for the two of us and i spent my first round in the game as a human. I ran around looking for a place to hide, with so many options i prob chose the worst one, behind a movable box. Then "The ghost has been released" pops up on my screen and suspense is mounting. In the distance i hear a pitter patter of what seems to be some sticky fat little feet slapping the ground. But with so many creepy sounds and noises in the backround i dont think much of it. But the noise of those chunky soda covered feet sounds like its getting louder and closer. My heart begins to race not really knowing what to expect, i wasn't even sure i would be found but this game has a way of putting you on the edge of your seat. Finally the footsteps are closer than they've been the entire time, they sound like hes standing right ontop of me. And then....scilence.... I could hear a pindrop at this point. I become anxious and start getting antsy behind my pathetic excuse for a hiding place. 15 more seconds pass and i still dont hear anything so now im starting to think he may have passed me. I crouch walk my way into the closest room, easing my way past bookshelves. As i round the last shelf i turn to my right and what do i see. A giant headed baby bathsoaked in blood with the creapiest little smirk ive ever seen. He pounced me and i ♥♥♥♥ my pants a little bit as i screamed like a 10  year old girl at a Jonas Brothers concert. I cant even look at my 18 month old son the same anymore and when i hear him run across the tiles of my kitchen floor it gives me PTSD of my horrific encounter in Dead Realm. 10/10 would ♥♥♥♥ my pants again","August 4, 2015","true","18.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","7","7","5","0"

A lot of people complain about the price, which is totally understandable  because 14.99€ is a lot for a game like this. Sure, it's an Early Access Game and i guess there are gonna be new monsters and gamemodes but to be honest, for me, 10€ would've been enough.\nLet's just say, the atmosphere is amazing. I love the maps and all the (secret) hiding spots, i think the maps are really well designed. Also, the "smartphone" option is really great, once you get used to it you can actually escape the monster/tell where it is (if it's near you). I don't know if the Wolf does make any sounds but you can definitely hear Baby William's foot steps which just increases the whole atmosphere and tension.\nOverall, i think it's a great game to play with friends or even strangers, it just really needs an ingame chat for the people who either don't have a mic or don't wanna talk.","August 6, 2015","true","15.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

This just shows you what can happen if people get to gether to make a game.\npros: the scare factor is reall this game is so terrifying you never know when your going to be caught and when you do get caught make sure to have an extra pair of underware with you XD .\nIt can be fast paced or it can last awhile depending on who is the ghost.\ngame play is very smooth and it quickly became natural as to when you should use your abillitys.\nThe cameras were an awesome idea (i do have a complant about them further on) its was funny and scary to watch as your fellow humans got reaped one by one making this a great addition to the game\n\n\nCons: match making should be a little more specific and should give you an  idea as to how manny pings that lobby is for you (before the game starts). The battery life for hacking the cameras and using your ghost detector is two long , while me and my friends were playing we easily figured out how to stay away from the ghost by using the cameras for a long time, we were able to give warnings and continue to track the ghost for prolonged times witch took the fear factor out of it a bit.\n\nThis as of right now is a 8/10 for me witch means you will not regret this purches it will be a 10/10  if those things are adressed.","July 30, 2015","true","15.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Dead Realm needs Dedicated Servers, it seems anyone I play with cannot host a seven player game, and that's seriously why I don't play this game as much as I want to, even if its in Early Access.\n\nAlso you might also consider to look at the System Requirements, a decent PC is fine, but if its anything below that, its a no no.\n\nThanks to my buddy Gem, I own this game, but if you're going to plan to buy this, i suggest you wait for them to finish the game to buy it.\n\n10/10 would not host again.","November 18, 2015","false","1.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

I took the chance hoping that this game turned out better than Damned. I was wrong - even at $5, I regret the purchase. Fair warning: some Youtuber with a decent following posted a highlights video of the game that makes it look like quite a blast. They've acknowledged they are friends with the developer and that the video is to help them out. "YMMV" is an understatement.\n\n+ Nice concept\n\n-/+ Good variety of creature types to play as. Unfortunately, monsters with the "sense players" ability such as the wolfman are so effective as to make the other selections pointless. Some of the other monsters don't even seem to have abilities; they're essentially skins without the ability to detect players.\n\n- You can play hide and seek with your friends for free.\n\n- Despite playing on Halloween, during a sale, the server list is virtually dead.\n\n- Despite waiting to find a server within an "acceptable ping range", the players lag so terribly that "catching" someone frequently consists of spamming attack in the area you pray they are in currently, rather than where you see their character model. Extremely obnoxious, and not at all scary.\n\n- Humans are just as fast as monsters, and for some reason have forcefields and clones. When combined with the horrendous lag, "chases" consist of human players smoking 30 bowls of crack and then spam-jumping, glitching, and warping their way through the map. Extremely obnoxious, and not at all scary.\n\n- Player "hiding spots" frequently consist of glitch/exploit locations, just one example is using human clones to create bridges leading to locations impossible to reach otherwise. Considering they vanish shortly after creation, and considering monsters cannot make clones, this leads to stalemates where players simply watch the timer run out. You guessed it: obnoxious.\n","November 1, 2015","false","1.6"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","0"

When playing as the ghost you can choose between a creepy ♥♥♥ baby and a not as scary wolfman. Playing this game with friends is amazingly fun and the feeling that you get when you're being chased is great. The only bad thing about this game so far is the right-click when you're a ghost. Right clicking reveals where all the humans are and in general is not very fun. My friends had an idea to where you can only use your right-click once per game which made the game much more fun and challenging. This game is great to play with friends and I would recommend it. Although you might want to make sure your friends get it or it won't be too fun.","August 9, 2015","true","8.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","1"

HOWEVER, That being said, its a decent game. I can tell you I had fun with my friends on this game.\n\nWe screwed around, made each other jump etc. but we also set ground rules about how we play. We never use the "seek" ability in the game PERIOD. It was much more fun just looking for them "blind" because of how much this game is tilted in the monster's favor.  We always had fun that way because it was harder for the monster and it can lead to the monster being right next to you and your friend just walking by, followed by the  "Man you were right next to me a while ago" conversation. The problem is is that you can't do that with random people. Or at least trust them to keep their word.\n\nThat is why I am giving this game a negative review. Its fun IF you have friends to play with and have a gentelman's agreement to not use the monster ability to find the survivors.\n\nThere is another game called "damned" that you should check out if you feel this review was helpful. The monsters are waaay more terrifying and they all work differently and therefore are countered differently. Its just a lot buggier than this game but otherwise I feel it delivers what this game tried to much better.","February 21","false","3.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is probably one of BEST scary games out there. Why? Let me tell you. First off, its hide and seek you get the feeling that you are being chased. Adding onto that its a scary game. A Wolf And A Baby chasing you? Scary enough. Most of the negative reviews are just saying about how the jumpscares weren't scary. Now, firstly when you know a jumpscare is coming then you know your gonna get scared so you look away. But when you dont know when a jumpscare is coming you jump. (Or there just cowards that cant be bothered to turn their volume up) The Ghosts And The Humans both have their advantages. Humans can use their radar to check if the ghost is nearby. They also can hack the security cameras to find where the ghost is. And they can sprint longer than the ghosts (Only In Hide And Reap) They can use Shields to protect them and decoys to trick the ghosts. Ghosts are powerful aswell. Ghosts are able to see humans through walls for a few seconds but when they get close they have to find him in that area (Only in Hide And Reap) They can also drop banshees to alert the ghost to the humans posistion (Only In Bounty) When they kill a human they'll turn into a spirit and they'll have to help the ghost to reap the other humans (Only in Hide And Reap) The Starting Ghost can turn invisible for a few seconds. (Unlimited In Bounty) 2 modes. Hide And Reap and Bounty. Bounty is like slender but there is 10 watches that you'll have to find and the ghost is always invisible and if you run the ghost will see you through a wall. Hide And Reap is hide and seek but with the ghosts and they must reap the other humans before time runs out. I highly reccomend though to play with friends as it is more fun.","August 2, 2015","true","70.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

The survivors have shield and decoy abilities to help them, but unless the ghost player is just a complete idiot they're pretty worthless. Instead of having each level be a map full of keys and codes that you have to find and use to make your way through the maps, most of the rounds are just based around hiding and surviving for a time limit, with one game mode where there are 10 stopwatches spread around the map to pick up and use to power the exit portal. If you can run Damned (it does have some optimization issues, so it's kind of a gamble), I don't see any actual reason to buy this game in its current state, since even despite being considerably less polished and a bit more buggy Damned is a far more entertaining game.","October 30, 2015","false","0.7"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","15","27","0","0"

Ideally you want no one above 100 ping as it renders that player unable to really function which becomes worse when they are chosen as the ghost. Outside of that the game feels solid for not having many location choices but in those choices is complexity of layouts that can get players turn around often. As well as a number of little hidey places. Least that was how that was for me as both human and ghost. The vibe is rather spot on of keeping the humans on their toes with some ambient sounds being rather ambiguous as to it was caused by the ghost or not.\n\nThe big thing for me that makes the game hard is the mouse setting. Without numbers I don't think I will ever find the sweet spot of my mouse not being painfully slow and too fast.\n\nHonestly as someone who never got really into horror titles let alone things that have jump scares I can get behind recommending it as in someways being with friends makes the horrors both easier and worse to deal with depending on what happends.","November 1, 2015","true","1.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

(unless you get if from ♥♥♥ or something that way)\nTo have the best experience i would say that you need at least 5+ friends to play with for it to be fun and not to become boring too quickly, it has some downsides tho, for example: There's only 3 maps to play in and if you learn the layout's  of them all and start playing with people     (referring more to playing with strangers)     it get kind of boring after a while since you know all the hiding spots.      (it basically becomes so that you are in an op spot and the ghost cannot reach you, and it gets boring since there's no challenge)     It starts to become a bit boring since its too easy. But if your'e looking for a game to play with some friends and like hide and seek, then i definitely recommend this game for you and your pal's!    9/10. 1 point away  because there's so few maps and i really think there could be more things to hide inside of and hidden rooms.

The smartphone mechanic is great for knowing when you're about to get scared and adds to the tension. The invisiblity mechanic as a ghost is also great for tension and scares, but the most impressive part is that this game also pulls off the feat of making humans feel that they have some level of control, instead of being totally powerless like in so many other games of this type. Shields can help humans make a quick getaway and to make the ghost lose their tail, and decoys can fool the ghost's enhanced senses (an ability that I previously thought was very overpowered) by making the enhanced sense pick up on the decoy instead of the real thing.\nFurthermore, it's not just powers that make this game great. If you are caught and 'reaped' by the ghost. you join their side as a spirit instead of having to spectate the rest of the match. Hiding spots are also good, as there are some which the ghost often won't be able to get to without an assisting spirit, but they are far from an automatic win. The ghost's enhanced senses also isn't overpowered, as if you get close enough to a human with it (about a room's length) it stops showing the marker and you will have to start searching.\n\nTo summarise, this is an amazing game that has implemented some great mechanics to balance both teams, so that instead of it being another 'monster is nearly guaranteed a win' game, it's actually pretty much a 50:50 chance of either side winning.","July 31, 2015","true","18.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Additionally, they can use the signal on their cellphone to tell if the ghost is nearby (The presence of the ghost will make the signal gradually blur, and eventually change colors). In the event that the ghost is chasing the player, the humans are able to place decoys that can fool the ghost (Or even use these decoys as stepping stones to get onto higher areas--a rather advanced strategy) and shields that can temporarily wall off the ghost so you can make your escape. On top of this, there are spots that players can hide in to make it harder to reap them. The number of hiding locations can be endless! Simple enough, right?\n\nBut the ghost also has his advantages. Either as a vicious werewolf or the infant son of a grisly murderer, you must pursue your victims to the end and reap them, one by one. The ghost runs far faster than humans, and can go into invisibility to sneak up on unsuspecting prey. Additionally, they can use a special type of vision that allows them to see the living souls of human beings. Lastly, the ghost's victims turn into spirits, which have less abilities than the ghost itself but can also reap what used to be their former comrades.\n\nThe game itself is in early access. You could glitch right through the floor of an elevator as it is going up. You could walk right through paintings. You could fall down a cabinet you're standing on and glitch into it. The game itself is not perfect... yet. But does the game offer the creepy experience? Definitely. Is it fun? Definitely.\n\nYou know what you have to do now. Grab some friends, make a room, and prepare to share a pitch black setting with a life-threatening poltergeist.","August 9, 2015","true","14.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The smartphone mechanic is great for knowing when you're about to get scared and adds to the tension. The invisiblity mechanic as a ghost is also great for tension and scares, but the most impressive part is that this game also pulls off the feat of making humans feel that they have some level of control, instead of being totally powerless like in so many other games of this type. Shields can help humans make a quick getaway and to make the ghost lose their tail, and decoys can fool the ghost's enhanced senses (an ability that I previously thought was very overpowered) by making the enhanced sense pick up on the decoy instead of the real thing.\nFurthermore, it's not just powers that make this game great. If you are caught and 'reaped' by the ghost. you join their side as a spirit instead of having to spectate the rest of the match. Hiding spots are also good, as there are some which the ghost often won't be able to get to without an assisting spirit, but they are far from an automatic win. The ghost's enhanced senses also isn't overpowered, as if you get close enough to a human with it (about a room's length) it stops showing the marker and you will have to start searching.\n\nTo summarise, this is an amazing game that has implemented some great mechanics to balance both teams, so that instead of it being another 'monster is nearly guaranteed a win' game, it's actually pretty much a 50:50 chance of either side winning.","July 31, 2015","true","18.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I got it on the Halloween sale for a few dollars and I don't regret it at all. The gameplay is fun with finding good hiding places or trying to parkour up to cool places and the chases are pretty invigorating. My only complaints are: the servers aren't always great. Ping can be very high at times. I had a friend who got up to 3000 ping and he has pretty good internet. Also sometimes my fps will drop for no reason and it's not even a graphically intensive.

The Devs seem to have abandoned the game since that update, leaving the game broken and a waste of money.\n\nIf they fix the Bug then I highly recommend the game.

The updates bring cool new things progressively getting it better, Loads of fun to play with friends as the great fun gameplay of survival and hiding from the many ghost characters. I really do recommend Dead Realm as a must buy. It has everything the type of game needs and really does make me happy to have it. I rate 10/10 as because it's a early access game it is so god damn sexy. Good ideas game play, configurable settings which are easy to figure out and you don't need the best PC in the world to play it. That is why I think Dead Realm is a great game for anyone.","November 8, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

However, after about 1 1/2 hours of trying different modes we found the game quite boring and not fun.  I'm thinking this is just a game that got a push on Youtube because of a large channel playing it a lot.\n\nBasically, I do not recommend this game, in fact, we all didnt like this game so much, we all put in for a refund.  That was the first time I have ever had a collaboration where we all agreed the game was boring and not worth playing.

This game pretty much requires you to have friends to play with. I had some fun with the 3-4 friends that I played with on it BUT the fun doesn't last. You eventually get bored after a couple of games which are 10 minutes long each. The monster ALWAYS knows where you are (In the only good gametype currently) which eliminates any feel of hide and seek. The monster needs some clue of where people may be, true, but this method is way too OP meaning the monster almost always wins. The monster can literally right click his mouse and it will highlight the players. It does need to be recharged but the range of it is unbelievable.\n\nPros:\n-Good Concept\n-Nice abilities such as shield and holograms\n-A very unique and original camera system that lets you look through the cameras while you "hide"\n-Balanced Stamina System\n-Atmospheric\n\nCons:\n-The F***ing price you pay for what you currently get is bullsh*t. Waay to high.\n\n-Monsters ability to see you most times is too OP (Overpowered)\n\n-There are currently only 2 gametypes, Seek and Reep and Bounty. In Bounty, you have to find watches scattered around. The monster cannot see you in this gametype but its pointless as you DONT NEED to hide.

It's not so bad for me since I have controls on my mouse to change my DPI :D\n\nHere's some gameplay, about 22 minutes of gameplay.\n\nIt should process into HD shortly...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhtBYAIYOZA","July 30, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

My boyfriend and I wanted to play together so I created a server and he still couldn't find it. It eventualy loaded out and it worked but it took forever.

I have different opinions than you do.\n\nVisuals\nVisuals in this game are pretty nice, graphics are good and game runs fast for me.\n\nLag\nLag is to be had in the game (for me) aka the characters not syncing up with time. Apart from that, lag-free.\nAbout This Game:\n\nAbout This Game\nIt's been almost 100 years since a reclusive electricity tycoon named William Huxley murdered his family and staff in the most grisly fashion. Among the dead were Huxley’s son, Baby William, and his henchman, the “Wolfman.” Now you and your friends must enter Huxley’s shadowy world to find special artifacts and uncover his secrets before you are killed.\n\nDead Realm is a creepy, multiplayer action game with beautiful, immersive environments. You can play as either a Ghost or a Human character and work with your friends to run, hide, survive… or die.\n\nGameplay\nGameplay is good, I love the running animations, and as always, jumpscares scare me alot, especially when you don't expect it.\n\nOverall\nGame is 9/10, not 10/10, due to the lag and such.\n","September 5, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So let's get started!\n\nI will have the rating(s) that I give it at the end of the review.\n\n\nLet's Review The DEVs\n\nThis is a topic I can go either way about they make mistakes but they also make improvments to the game and all mistakes can be re-coded and fixed!\n\nThe Devs have been "Away" from updating us about their game which I find frustrating when I buy an Early Acess Game I want to be updated regularly because as an Early Acess buyers we are supporting the creating of this game and we deserve to know EXACTLY what is going on with the money we have spent on this game.\n\nOn another note the Devs of this game are great other than leaving us in the dark for long periods of time they do take in our Feedback and apply it into the game on each update which is awesome.\n\n\nGameplay\n\nPlaying Dead Realm is something that hasn't been done very offtain the only other game I can think of that has attempted this (but failed) is Damned, or Friday the 13th which hasn't been releashed yet.\n\nDead Realm has smooth Gameplay but at times can have FPS drops but this is an Early Acess so it is to be expected that this kinda thing will happen. The game is scary and intense at times for example when I first played my first game I got so scared that the baby was coming I started screaming then when he got me from behind and I didn't see him until the face popped up I threw my headset and screamed lol.\n\nThe gameplay though can do with some work to get around the FPS drops the Graphics aren't the greatest so FPS drops shouldn't happen as much as they do but they promised to fix this issue so we have to wait and see about it.\n\n\nCommunity/Servers\n\nI'm going to start this off with saying PLAY THE DAMN GAME PEOPLE the game has 1000s of people who bought it but stop giving it a chance and drop it so without people playing it how are new players suppose to enjoy the game playing by themselves? If you buy an Early Acess game please support it more we want the Devs to want to keep making the game and for people to buy the game and play with us!\n\nThe Community of people who I know play this are great people sit there and talk smack to the ghost and the moment you hear the words "I'm coming for you" you shut right up since you know he's around and the smack talk is all fun and games to keep everyone on their toes.\n\nCurrently their aren't many people that play but don't let that change your mind on buying it because the game is good we just need more people to start playing!\n\n\nRating\n\nThe rating(s) I give this game take in account everything I have listed and I hope the review helps you chose if you want this game or not.\n\nField        Rating                Devs        4/10                Gameplay        7/10                Community        3/10\nPLEASE NOTE THAT I WILL UPDATE THIS REVIEW EVERY NEW UPDATE TO KEEP YOU GUYS UP TO DATE WITH MY RESPONES","April 17","true","11.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It doesn't perfect any particular category, or really aim to.  It only seeks to make you cry out in jumpscares being chased by your friend in secret-filled creepy festive maps.  and it does that well.\nTaunting people with the the ghost is hilarious, and adds to it.\n\nIt seems in some modes that balance can be a little off, competitively, but it's not unplayable at all.  Some modes favor humans over ghosts and vice versa, but only a little bit.\n\nSome rubber banding happening or something with servers, again not unplayable.\n\nWish there were more graphical options, and proper resolution setting (as I run with 3x screens and have to switch to one to play at 1920x1080).\n\nEarly access games are awesome.  You will find issues, but you can see how awesome some games are working toward being, and this one is one of them.\n\n84/100","November 4, 2015","true","7.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was scared of Dead Realm before I played it and I really wanted to be scared, I was also setting myself up for the inevitable dissapointment too because I've never found a game that is actually thrilling to play and makes you so nervous of being caught, most games you would probably get bored of hiding and run around trolling but this.. no.. this game will make you sit under a table for 10 minutes without even moving to look around because you know the ♥♥♥♥ing horrors that wait for you outside, the first time I got reaped I screamed, I'm a 23 year old guy that would honestly say no game could ever make me flinch or scream... I screamed, I pushed my monitor and it fell over... I was not expecting some of the things that are in there.\n\nIf you want a game to play with friends that can actually give you a genuine fun time then this is it, only thing I could ask for is more maps (varient of size for smaller or larger groups) more monsters and maybe the ability to ♥♥♥♥ with people more eg turning lights on and off, turning electronics on and off, opening and closing doors or blocking routes from a distance.\n\ngreat game, great devs.","November 3, 2015","true","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It doesn't perfect any particular category, or really aim to.  It only seeks to make you cry out in jumpscares being chased by your friend in secret-filled creepy festive maps.  and it does that well.\nTaunting people with the the ghost is hilarious, and adds to it.\n\nIt seems in some modes that balance can be a little off, competitively, but it's not unplayable at all.  Some modes favor humans over ghosts and vice versa, but only a little bit.\n\nSome rubber banding happening or something with servers, again not unplayable.\n\nWish there were more graphical options, and proper resolution setting (as I run with 3x screens and have to switch to one to play at 1920x1080).\n\nEarly access games are awesome.  You will find issues, but you can see how awesome some games are working toward being, and this one is one of them.\n\n84/100","November 4, 2015","true","7.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game would have been a great game but sadly the developers gave up on it so the bugs that are in the game i guess are there forever.. There's a mouse bug that makes your mouse lose control for a minute... It seems like it makes your sensitive (ik i probably spelled tht wrong) shoot all the way up than when its done you go back to normal... It happens often also to often to where you don't want to play it no more... There's also some small glitches but thats comes with every game... I really wish and hope that the devepolers come back to this game an atlease fix the bugs we have now so the game is be really fun again... I know they made commented on someones post or something saying that they're working on the update to get it fix but that was so long ago that it's strong to believe that it wont happen... Now i know all i've really done here so far is compline about this game but its really is fun... A great game to play with your friends or just with randoms... Its fun, scary, and a game you can sit there and play for hours without even knowing you've been playing for that long... I do recomend this game for you to buy but i feel like, an alot of friends an people i know feel like, since there most likely wont be another update to this game or if there will be it's not gonna be anytime soon, steam and the people for the game should cut the price off it... To me it's not really right to have someone pay that much for a game that wont have an update and has bugs that makes it unplayable at times... Atlease cut the price to $10 or something just to make it right.., To make a long review short, get the game its worth it but be ready for some bugs","March 24","true","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game would have been a great game but sadly the developers gave up on it so the bugs that are in the game i guess are there forever.. There's a mouse bug that makes your mouse lose control for a minute... It seems like it makes your sensitive (ik i probably spelled tht wrong) shoot all the way up than when its done you go back to normal... It happens often also to often to where you don't want to play it no more... There's also some small glitches but thats comes with every game... I really wish and hope that the devepolers come back to this game an atlease fix the bugs we have now so the game is be really fun again... I know they made commented on someones post or something saying that they're working on the update to get it fix but that was so long ago that it's strong to believe that it wont happen... Now i know all i've really done here so far is compline about this game but its really is fun... A great game to play with your friends or just with randoms... Its fun, scary, and a game you can sit there and play for hours without even knowing you've been playing for that long... I do recomend this game for you to buy but i feel like, an alot of friends an people i know feel like, since there most likely wont be another update to this game or if there will be it's not gonna be anytime soon, steam and the people for the game should cut the price off it... To me it's not really right to have someone pay that much for a game that wont have an update and has bugs that makes it unplayable at times... Atlease cut the price to $10 or something just to make it right.., To make a long review short, get the game its worth it but be ready for some bugs","March 24","true","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is scary, wether you join a match where no one has a mic so you are running around/crawling in silence, waiting to be attacked or you join a game with a bunch of noisy people who shreik when they get reaped, both add so much tension. Then when you do get reaped and are transferred to the opossing team, it adds a whole new element of fun since you get to be the agressor stalking the humans. There are only a few maps but they are all very well designed with so much detail, the sound design is incredible as you can be crawling in a vent on one side of the map but faintly hear the rattling clunks of the elevator as it goes up on the other side of the map. The movement in this game isnt all that bad, it can get a bit clunky but that will probably be sorted out later. Definitely a great game to play once in a while and get the ♥♥♥♥ scared out of you.","August 16, 2015","true","18.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

It is fun to play the game modes and hiding from the ghost while hearing everyone screaming as they run away. IF you get into a good lobby you can spend hours playing tihs game. Give it a shot, it is well worth the price. Who doesnt love a creepy, multiplayer, funny, playable game of hide and seek?","August 18, 2015","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
