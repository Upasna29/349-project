It's got the appearance of a classic zelda game, but there are more areas where you just wander around and talk to random people. You also don't so much unlock sexy new combat abilities and weapons, but just unlock new areas with new traps and puzzles to deal with. There are still boss fights, some of which will give you a challenge, but don't expect the non-stop action of a zelda game. This is much more of an exploration of the mildly dark and mildly bizarre. Not for everyone, but I think many people will find it worthwhile.","December 23, 2014","true","10.0"," 53 of 55 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","53","55","0","3"

I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nIt's a Legend of Zelda-like with a ton of strange thematic choices, poor writing, too much dialogue and tonal shifts that will give a player whiplash. What few inventive game mechanics it employs are spread throughout an atrociously long and dull climb to nowhere. You might pass through seven screens just to get to the next place: no enemies, no obstacles to speak of, just a march. As if the designers (credited indie devs Sean Hogan Jonathan Kittaka) couldn't be bothered, having come up with the overall map of an area, to fill it in with things. This becomes very apparent when retracing your steps. You will find a checkpoint at the beginning of an area, putting you on guard for the trials ahead. Then those trials never manifest and seven screens later there's another checkpoint.\n\nTo what end? Was my adversary through that place boredom? Will checkpoints at the beginning and end of a stretch really help me combat that adversary?\n\nThe few basic enemies you encounter are all laughably simplistic. Many pose no threat at all. Some cannot even harm you. This led me to think perhaps they were more of a rhetorical device than a game object, really. The only rhetorical question that sprang to mind was "why am I still playing this?" Then later I encountered fire-breathing lions and they shot my dandy theory to hell.\n\nBut I do know the answer to that rhetorical question, as the game is a little more than a poorly-written, bland, easy Zelda clone.\n\nFirst, even though the various mechanics are spread out way too far, the few that the game offers are very neat. Even with all the crummy verbosity, the game does not tutorialize, rather giving you the tools and letting you figure things out. A good bit of design. The nugget of a good game. I would never have thought that piles of dust could have so many uses, but there you go.\n\nSecond, there is at least one boss in the game that requires a neat bit of fooling and approaches a reasonable challenge. Shame that I can only honestly say that about one of perhaps eight or so bosses, but that one is very good and fun.\n\nThird, there are a few counter-intuitive design choices that I won't spoil that I do admire as choices. It is this last point that keeps my thumb pointing up with all I've said about the game to this point. What I will say is that it's a shame you only get the full, mechanically complete game after playing through the whole thing.\n\nHeck I guess that's a second way it reminds me of Fez. The first was the music and sound effects. Which I didn't mention. Okay.\n\nThe music is fine if you're into chiptunes and oscilloscopes. Tones, mostly sine waves. Some triangle. There are several good tones.\n\nWhich is more than I can say about the jokes. Those are all tonedeaf. And just grating given everything else that happens. I want to say that, as a rule, you don't get to make crappy puns about bicycles with names in the same game where you murder a man and jump into his corpse-portal to go commit an abortion on a tentacle monster. Which is part of what I mean when I say the game is tonally all over the place. Anything vaguely interesting as a narrative point just gets dropped somewhere; crushed away by screen after screen of nothing happening.\n\nThings I didn't like:\nbad jokes\nboring, longwinded dialogue\nblandness\nuseless screens\nlack of difficulty\n\nThings I did like:\ninventive mechanics\npost-game elements\ncertain specific challenges\ncute enemy names\nno navi\n\nBuy it on sale. At the time of this writing it is half-off the ten dollar list price, which still feels like a bit much for what you're getting. Do not pay ten dollars for this game, at any rate.","December 29, 2013","true","12.2"," 103 of 133 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","103","133","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/234900/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Anodyne is a top down action-adventure game that draws inspiration from some of the classic Zelda titles. The developers’ fondness for that iconic series is readily apparent, and at its best Anodyne feels like a genuine love letter to the adventure games of yesteryear. It does have a bit of a little brother problem, and its efforts to follow in the footsteps of its idol ultimately fall a bit short of the mark.\n\nAt first it seems like the story might be a cute little homage to Zelda, with a little bit of snark thrown in to keep things entertaining. Then things start getting weird. Only little things feel a bit off at first, but before long a general unease begins to permeate the game and you realize that this is not a simple hero saves the world kind of story. I don’t remember any of the older Zelda games featuring paranoid schizophrenics mumbling to themselves in the woods, and I certainly don’t remember finding any houses where the occupant had hung himself. The game vacillates between goofy humor and dark set pieces creating this really unique and interesting atmosphere. Anodyne does a particularly good job at pulling off the creepiness because it cloaks itself with an air of nostalgia.\n\nWhile the atmosphere is solid and there are some interesting portions, ultimately the story doesn’t seem to know what it wants to do. While the first couple of dungeons do seem to at least have some coherent theme and hints at the overall narrative, later portions seem almost entirely unrelated to each other and it feels like the game is being weird simply for the sake of being weird. At times there is an effort to be philosophical, but it is clumsily done and certain segments wind up feeling pretentious. There just isn’t a cohesive narrative, and while bits and pieces are genuinely interesting or unsettling, as a whole the story just ends up feeling disjointed.\n\nAnodyne is about as old school as you can get, and there is a heavy reliance the simple puzzles and exploration that made the old Zelda games so successful. There is a nice big map the look through with a lot of things to find, and the exploration actually gets better after you defeat the final boss because you unlock a new ability that lets you reach corners of the map that were previously inaccessible. While I don’t want to spoil anything, it really is a clever and very unique tool to have at your disposal and it is just a little disappointing that the game waited until it was over to pull out what was really its best trick. I found the post game stuff almost more enjoyable than the actual quest, and Anodyne does a nice job of not only encouraging exploration, but giving you a lot of interesting environments to explore. The levels are well varied and memorable and alternate between standbys like forests and cliffs and bizarre, unsettling environments like a black and white town inhabited by ghosts or a creepy circus with ominous headstones detailing past events.\n\nThe actual gameplay is simple but well executed and that the game remains entertaining throughout its entire run. You wield a broom to defend yourself against a variety of enemies, many of which are mostly harmless once you figure out their simple patterns. The boss battles are somewhat of a disappointment and tend to lack any sort of creativity or challenge to make defeating them feel rewarding, with the notable exception of the final boss. As a whole the game is fairly easy, with the only real difficulty coming in the form of some poorly implemented platforming segments.\n\nEach dungeon usually has some new mechanic for you to play around with, including one that is an actual maze and another that uses speed panels to help you jump further. There isn’t as much variety here as you’ll find in a lot of the classic Zelda games, but there is enough that the game prevents itself from becoming too repetitive. Simple puzzles end up blocking your progress in the various dungeons, but unfortunately most of them aren’t any more complicated than getting an enemy to stand on a switch.\n\nWhile Anodyne is clearly piggybacking on the classic Zelda games, it offers a unique experience and manages to find its own voice, even if that voice occasionally morphs into the high pitched scream of nightmare ghouls. Fans of the old school adventure games should definitely enjoy the combination of exploration and puzzles the game offers and Anodyne is a nice throwback to a type of game that you simply can’t find any more. The game does end up feeling a bit more like Zelda-lite than an actual Zelda title, and the actual gameplay and puzzle design lack the same creativity found in the wonky story and environments. Even with its flaws, this is a very impressive product from what was essentially a two man team and is worth checking out for anyone who still remembers how to find all the dungeons in the original Legend of Zelda.","September 17, 2015","true","24.8"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","38","41","0","1"

There's the enough challenges peppered throughout, accompanied by an effectively simple soundtrack and the dialogue does have a few moments of humour and insight.","October 15, 2014","true","9.2"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","31","32","0","0"

The screen doesn't scroll. When you get to the edge, you go into a new screen, just like Zelda. Its very simple, with an attack button, movement buttons and a menu button.\n\nIt has simple combat with a good variety of enemies, but there are also good puzzles that feel unique to this game. Things like using a broom to collect dust to place that dust to block things. Again, its very simple and easy. There is no hand holding with this game and you are free to figure things out yourself, BUT when new things are introduced they will bluntly tell you yes you can do this. Such as when you attack dust, it tells you, you've collected dust, attack again to place the dust. It will spoon feed you new things as most good games do, but it doesn't force you to do several tutorials. Once to test a new skill and that's it. The game lets you loose. It doesn't feel like you'll get lost, areas are pretty confined and you have a Zelda 1 like map, there are portals that let you quick travel.\n\nLike all Zelda games, there are keys that you'll need. Not just normal keys that open most locked doors, but specific keys to enter new areas. If that wasn't enough, you'll be collecting enemy cards. Enough of these cards will unlock specific gates with numbers on them. Along the way, you'll also find fairies or red insects that will not only fill your health, but also increase your health overall.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is very surreal or creepy, which is awesome, its a different flavor to Zelda that makes it feel unique. You're a janitor in a dark, surreal world. In fact, I think the game is trying to subtly hypnotize you with its music and sound effects like clicking, tick tocking and chimes. Nothing is really explained, it just is and I'm okay with that. I don't need a story, even if there are NPCs every so often to talk with.\n\nOne drawback to the game on PC is that the screen is tall and narrow like an old school arcade cabinet. This tall resolution is because Anodyne is also an Android OS game. A fun Android game, but it doesn't help it on PC.\n\nIn all, this game feels good and enjoyable. If you're into simple puzzles, action adventure and a SIMPLE old school Zelda that lets you explore a lot; this is for you. If you're into a complex, deep Zelda experience with a rich story, this game isn't for you.","March 29, 2014","true","2.8"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","31","37","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/234900/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","The Legend of Zelda is without any shred of doubt one of the most important and influential games ever made. Nintendo’s landmark release has inspired hundreds of games and mechanics within them, and you can't take two steps without hearing a developer site it as one of their biggest inspirations when developing their own games. Indie game Anodyne is one such example of a very close replication of LoZ's core gameplay, which isn't necessarily a bad thing in and of itself, but unfortunately fails to bring anything new to a very crowded table that results in but another poor attempt to recapture the magic of a classic.\n\nYou take control of Young, a man who wakes up in an unknown realm called the Nexus. You are told that you must protect Briar from the darkness, but first must prove your worth by scouring the land for cards. And, that’s pretty much all you need to know. The story unravels in a nonlinear way, leaving much for you to deduce for yourself and numerous questions without straight answers. Unfortunately this initial air of mystery falls apart after you've progressed further into the game and come to realize the developers have no intention of ever answering or even elaborating on the many threads making up its haphazard plot.\n\nYou run into a lot of characters during your travels, but none of them have anything relevant or useful to say. One of my biggest issues I had is that the dialog aspires to far more lofty and philosophical heights than it has any hope of reaching, ending up feeling pointless and pretentious, while at the same time completely throwing off the tone of the game. A lot of heavy subjects are brought up, from antisocial paranoia, to self worth and parental neglect, but they are never expanded upon or even discussed beyond a cursory overview (which comes across as forced and in poor taste).\n\nIt’s clear this was a very personal experience for the writer behind the dialog, but putting all of your problems and insecurities into your game is a sure fire way to lose your audience. Adding to the disjointed tone is a bundle of worthless profanity that was unneeded and serves absolutely no purpose. I'm not sure why the developer felt the need to include random four letter words, as it doesn’t jell at all with the rest of the game, and even as someone not typically bothered by profanity felt a tad disgusted when presented with it in this context. The ending is the final nail in the coffin, coming completely out of left field and not giving even a remote sense of resolution. I will be the first person to advocate artistic expression, but the story fails on so many levels it had me wishing it hadn’t been included at all.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective Anodyne fairs a bit better, but on the whole still fails to do enough with what it attempts. You spend your time split between exploring an overworld, collecting cards and filling out your map, and then dipping into dungeons which comprise some basic puzzles and the occasional boss fight.\n\nIt's a formula that works, but in this case quickly becomes repetitive as you neither gain any new abilities, nor encounter consistently interesting puzzles to solve. So much of the game is comprised of nothing but wandering, that many areas feel like nothing but filler, featuring no purpose but to elongate your adventure and keep you away from the handful of smartly designed dungeons that could have made for a much tighter experience on their own.\n\nThe extensive backtracking also contributes to much of your time feeling like a grind, occasionally even breaking the game as paths close and you become forced to retread even more ground taking the long way to wherever you were headed. Simply put, it's poor design that frustrates and belittles the player, dragging the experience on longer than it needed to be and making the enjoyable sections a lot farther apart. It's a shame because at times I really felt Anodyne was onto something, but each time my hopes were shot down as I cursed the many aggravating design decisions the developers made.\n\nTruth be told, there were moments when I actually did enjoy my time with the game. The true problem is, to reiterate, the fact that Anodyne does absolutely nothing we haven’t already seen and not well enough to compensate for its lack of innovation. It has it’s moments, but by and large feels all too familiar, and ultimately had me wondering why I was playing it instead of so many other games. I never felt compelled to continue, and I doubt it will be finished by most.\n\nIf Anodyne does anything right, it’s the game’s music and art. The graphics wholly envelope the 16-bit era, with a wonderful pixel style that is both beautiful and varied. Each dungeon has it’s own look, from a noir inspired town, to a neon maze it is constantly evolving and giving you something new to look at. It may not all flow together, but it was the one thing that made me want to search out new dungeons.\n\nThe other half of the presentation is the music, which does a great job of selling the somber, lonely tone of the story, even when the dialog can’t. From gentle piano melodies, to a pounding jungle beat, it is just a great set of songs, and some I could actually see myself listening to outside the game. They are that good, and easily the best part of the game.\n\nIn the end though Anodyne left me wanting. Wanting for better levels, a better story, a better ending, but mostly, a better game. When I first began, I had little idea what to expect and was actually enjoying myself more than I would have expected. But as time went on, the gameplay never evolved, and the story only strayed farther and farther off course making me want to jump ship before it had completely sunk (which by the end it had definitely done.\n\nBy the time the credits had rolled, I was all too happy to be able to wash myself of the experience. I don't say that lightly, and hate to have to be so critical, but I simply cannot advise anyone to play what was one of the most disappointing games I've experienced in a long time.","November 26, 2013","false","5.1"," 108 of 168 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","108","168","0","2"

While I appreciate what the developers were striving for, I just can't recommend this game to others.  On the surface this appears to be a Zelda clone.  While that sounds promising, on delving deeper into this title nothing could be further from the truth.  While Zelda relies on great combat and clever puzzles, Anodyne relies on unfair combat and ridiculously hard platforming.  Enemies don’t stop in their tracks or bounce back when you hit them, so enemies that require numerous hits invariably result in damage to you as they just plow forward through your attacks.  In addition, the number of times you die from attempting next to impossible jumps becomes too much to bear.  Add in that native controller support simply does not work (in the forums the developers even go so far as to suggest getting a third party program such as xpadder or joy2key to make it work) even though partial controller support is listed on the store page, and I feel you have a product that could have used a lot more polishing before releasing on Steam.  For every moment of fun I experienced with this game, I experienced several more of frustration.  On a side note, towards the end of the game suddenly the F word appeared several times in dialog, whereas the rest of the game had been devoid of swearing.  While I have no problem with swearing in video games, I was playing through this game with my young niece and this sudden unexpected change in tone was not appreciated nor did it seem to fit the game.

It uses tried-and-true mechanics (with a bit of a spin) as part of its storytelling, but in a very subtle way.\n\nThe story itself is difficult to follow. The main theme certainly seems to be about some self-centered individual who is in a constant cycle of breaking and mending a friendship with someone else. The story begins with us in the middle of one of the "breaks" in the friendship. Young, the player character, expects it to be easy to fix the friendship, but the friend, Briar, is savvy to the cycle and won't be so quick to forgive. Young's journey is a humbling one, as he has to come to terms with his imperfections in order to show Briar he has changed. However, we can assume the cycle will continue. At least... that's what I got out of the story.\n\nIt's always tough with these sorts of surreal games to tell if it's just being weird for weird's sake or if everything has a specific meaning. However, this game at least stays consistent in its presentation, and for that much it's commendable.\n\nThe writing is excellent, the visuals are gorgeous for pixel art, the soundtrack is great (and surprisingly deep), and though the game only has one real mechanic for puzzles, it continually finds ways to keep it fresh. Unfortunately, the game is VERY formulaic. It doesn't take long to figure out exactly how each area will play out: enter a region, explore every cell on the map, enter a dungeon, explore every cell on the map, collect cards, fight a boss, repeat.\n\nThe dungeons themselves are designed impeccably and the overall pace is good enough that the predictability isn't too problematic. But occasionally I did roll my eyes upon entering a new area, thinking "Well here we go again."\n\nStill, if you like Legend of Zelda and games with a deeper thematic experience than average, I can't recommend this highly enough.","January 22, 2014","true","5.5"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

In general, the difficulty is well balanced with some annoying exceptions (e.g., the platforms where you need to make diagonal jumps and one of the final puzzles).\n\nAnodyne is an entertaining experience and worth the asking price.","September 7, 2014","true","12.0"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrman2k3/recommended/234900/","mrman2k3","Mallas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrman2k3/","1462 products in account","Anodyne feels like an homage to The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, but everything is just very... strange. Just like the classic Zelda game, it's played from a top-down perspective and many of the enemies are even based on similar enemies from the Zelda series. Some of the dialog is even a direct reference to Link's Awakening.\n\nYoung, the character you play as, wields a trusty broom instead of a sword. Sometimes the broom must be used to push around piles of dust in order to solve simple puzzles. These puzzles never feel to be the main focus, though, and there's an unexpected amount of jumping obstacles in many of the dungeons. You discover a few add-ons for your broom throughout the game, but that's the limit of the items you can use.\n\nYou travel through varied environments and have many odd encounters. Throughout the game, the mood shifts between being slightly "off" to very wrong. It's hard to explain, but here's an example: in one dungeon, there are inexplicably a bunch of identical-looking men that just wander the screen. You can't speak to them or attack them, but they stop your movement and you can push them out of the way. Whenever these men are on screen, there is a creepy sound effect. At another point in the game, you walk down a dock to a fisherman. When you press the button to try to talk to him, Young instead pushes him into the lake and he drowns in a bloody whirlpool. Even later, you must kill a bunch of townspeople so a guy will let you into his house. It's some very odd stuff, and much of it is accompanied by a somewhat creepy atmospheric soundtrack without much of a melody.\n\nAs a big fan of classic 2D Zelda games, I was excited to try out Anodyne. It's definitely a unique experience. Gameplay-wise, it never feels as well-polished as your typical Zelda game, but I did enjoy my time with it for the most part. There were a few times when I got lost and had to consult some maps online, though. At the very end of the game, I found that I had to get 36 of the hidden "cards" to progress. Fortunately I had gotten most of them while playing through, but it could have been particularly frustrating if I hadn't been collecting them throughout my game.","March 23, 2015","true","6.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","1"

Some of it made me feel a bit nostalgic and sad while sometimes it was just eerie.\n\nIt's difficult to make sense of the story but you do kind of get the idea. Do keep in mind that this is supposed to be your character's subconscious. It will make allusions to real life and how your character, Young, is just trying to stay out of it.\n\nEven though it's left to interpretation quite a bit, it doesn't feel like one of these very artsy games that makes no sense no matter how you look at it and that any vague interpretation could somewhat match. It's dreamy but still fairly obvious.\n\nThe game never feels exceptional but it's fun to go through. It shows multiple good example of game design where the game will show you that something is possible rather than tell you. You learn from doing and looking rather than reading.\n\nPuzzles were never overly elaborate or complicated but required enough thinking that it felt satisfying to solve them most of the time. Some enemies were difficult enough to be challenging without being frustrating.\n\nThe only thing I liked less of the game is the lack of "tracking". The lack of direction it has is perfectly fine as it just reinforces the exploration and adventure part. But there are some stuff that you will need to go back to later on in the game and the only thing the game tracks is where you've been. It would have been cool to see how many chests/cards you've obtained in each area. I found myself 2 or 3 cards short from being able to access the last area and just looked them up since I didn't feel like exploring every area I've been to another time.\n\nOtherwise, it was a really mysterious and cool experience. Although it borrows a lot from Zelda, don't expect this game to be one, just similar in some regards.\n\nTakes about 6 hours or so to finish, without skipping anything before the end of the game (there are some extra stuff once you're done). Considering this, 11$ might be a tad expensive but definitely get it if it's on sales.\n\nUpdate:\nFollowed a friend's advice and went back to get the remaining cards. I have to say, this further improve my opinion on this game.\n\nI initially thought it would be a chore, the sort of collectible you see in every AAA that serve no purpose other than extend the play time.\n\nI'll avoid spoiling anything but after completing Anodyne, you are given a tool which allows you to... Reach places you couldn't reach before. ...Including places you shouldn't reach.\n\nIt's surprisingly cool to go back and try to find anything you could have missed, especially the way that you're able to. There's something hard to describe about it... It's kind of like spying, seeing things you're not sure you should see. It's the same feeling as whenever you use debug functions or any sort of "wall hack" in a game and start seeing stuff that are no visible in the main game.\n\nIt made me remember all the time I spent exploring in Ocarina of Time with glitches. Or lookin at all the unused content. Except in Anodyne, it's actually part of the game. There are a bunch of areas that are not accessible in the "normal" game, and a lot of hidden goodies in them!\n\nI'm glad I went back, this made me like this game a lot more than I already did.","February 20","true","14.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I really don't have a grasp on what's going on yet other than I'm in a strange place trying to open portals to different areas. The HUD and the gameplay are exactly like Zelda classic. Your weapon is a broom which can be used to hit enemies, but also can pick up dust on the ground and place it for platform puzzles. You search areas for dungeons which you can enter and complete puzzles to fight a big boss. The art style is pretty classic 16-bit low resolution pixels. The beginning music is really annoying but the music from areas I'm in now are getting better. The programming/UI itself seems glitchy and could use some polish, but the engine is actually pretty good. Honestly, I'm enjoying it so far. I just wish I had a better grasp on what was going on. Also nothing has really jumped out at me as being awesome that separates it from Zelda.

The music pushes curiosity and retains a sense of exploration and puzzlement as the text is cryptic and at times humorous leading you to one area after another. My one nitpick is that the game may be a bit too easy, or at least for those who've been around top down RPG's like Zelda before.

It remindes me a lot of Links Awakening, with the world being a dream and the jumping-puzzles, although the latter being much more present in this game.\nIt is quiet simple, your only weapon is a broom. Enemies have a good variety and the levels are very well designed, especially the dungeons. They require some thinking to solve the puzzles and the game does not hold your hand, which I think is good. Reminded me of the old times and the feeling figuring out on yourself is very rewarding. Half-way through the game you get jumping boots and thats where the game got frustrating for me. The controls are very spongy and the jumps require pixel-perfect jumps, sometimes under pressure: jumping on one-tile-platforms with rolling bars of death? So much fun, especially when you realize that you get knocked back every time you get hit.\nThe story is very confusing and the writing keeps it that way. I'm not sure if I get it at all or it was deliberate that way, since it all happens in a dream and dreams don't always make sense. Still it reminds me somewhat of the story of Links Awakening, the bosses seem to warn you that be beating them, you will eventually destroy the whole world - at least thats what I got from it.\nIf you like the old, 2d-Zelda games, Anodyne is very well done spin on it.

However instead of a large repertoire of gadgets and items, Anodyne sticks with one main weapon and a very small amount of items. The mechanics, from boss fighting to exploring, are largely focused around platforming. Jumping at the right time and angle will be essential at certain points of the game. Given the game's rather brief life, it is understanble that gadgets and mechanics are kept fairly contained.\n\nLayered on top of the game is a bizarre narrative. There is certainly some failed humor every now and then, but you will also receive eerie messages, cryptic details, and what seems like nonsense. Also included among the dialog and regular text are the cards hidden throughout the game that act as indirective narrative. It is certainly an intriguing aspect, but don't expect to be rewarded with sure answers.\n\nAnodyne is not without its flaws though. The mix of humor, nonsensical dialogue and strange text will definitely turn away some players. The art style might scream Legend of Zelda, but this adventure has been pared down quite a bit and this is most noticeable through the lack progression and gadgets. For those of you that like secrets there are some pretty extensive ones here, but if you are wanting everything up front, a large portion of the game is kept hidden away.\n\nWith a charming aesthetic and surreal narrative, Anodyne is a neat hidden gem.

The game seems to be inspired by the old Zelda games in terms of gameplay and features a nostalgic pixel art. The game is all about exploring the dream world of the protagonist, who goes by the name of Young. The player uses a broom for combat and very few other items to proceed through the story. The goal of Anodyne is to collect a certain amount of cards, which are spread all over the world and often require solving puzzles and fighting enemies to progress to the end area of the game.\n\nMy first playthrough through this game went fairly fast, there were only a few stages that required some grinding. Considering that, I was happily surprised by the final boss fight, which in my opinion had an adequate level of difficulty. Also there were a few cards that required to solve rather challenging puzzles, but you don't need to collect all cards to finish the game, so that only comes into consideration if you intend to complete the game 100%. If so, the secret "???" items are also very difficult to find and obtain, even if you use a guide.\n\nI really liked the story of Anodyne, even though the dialogues sometimes screwed that up for me, but that's just a small downside to the otherwise so mystic atmosphere and the dream-like feeling which this game provides. All that is underlined by the enchanting pixel art and incredibly suitable and admirable music. This game possibly has one of my favourite gaming music pieces of all time.\n\nAll of this matches up to the foggy surreality that makes this game so fascinating for me and which is why I would recommend this game to you.

It is heavily derivative of top-down Zelda games like A Link to the Past, so fans of Zelda and Zelda-like games will enjoy Anodyne.\n\n\nGameplay\n\nAnodyne's controls are very well-designed. The fact that the game is controlled by a grand total of seven buttons (arrows, select/attack, back/jump, and menu) is an excellent design choice: far too often have I played games with separate buttons for every tool or weapon or action, or so many items that additional controls are needed to cycle through them. The menu very rarely has to be used to play the game, only needed to equip the occasional broom upgrade.\n\nThe card system is cute and unique, with each card having a funny little quote about the featured character. NPC and enemy design is well done; the sprites are simple and fit the aesthetic of the game, and the AI, while sometimes frustrating, works very well.\n\nLevel design, while not exceptionally innovative, is well-thought-out and well-executed, although a compass item for dungeons would be helpful for keeping track of what went where in previous rooms. The overworld is expansive and elaborate, with intricate, winding pathways in some areas and wide, open expanses in others. Again, the menu map could use some improvements, such as region labels, but it may just be a design choice.\n\n\nAesthetics\n\nAnodyne's 16-bit style is the perfect fit for what it is, and the idea of a Zelda-like game with modern and surrealist twists is certainly charming. The sprites and tileset are all well-drawn and aesthetically fitting, and the selective use of lighting and effects in some areas of the game is a small yet powerful touch.\n\nOne of the best parts of Anodyne is its music. The music is calm and distant, yet drives the gameplay in incredible ways. The player cannot help but nod along to the groovy, eccentric beats and melodies of the Hotel, the somber, melodic sways of the Temple, or the hesitant, ominous notes of the Cavern as they roam the halls and corridors and solve the grand puzzles contained within each unique dungeon.\n\n\nCons\n\nWhile overall a fantastic game, it could use a bit more in the side quest department, as the game, while nonlinear in layout, is fairly linear in terms of objective.\n\nThe bosses, while generally a bit tricky on the first or second try, are overall fairly easy and simple, without much variety in fight style (dodge its attacks, strike strike strike, wait for its anger phase to pass, rinse and repeat until dead).\n\nThere is not much incentive to stay alive in the game. Death means being sent back to the last checkpoint, which in a dungeon can be fairly common. Checkpoints are easy to find and easy to use, and saving at a different checkpoint from the previous one fully heals the player, which seems a bit cheap. There is no currency to be lost, and dying does not reset progress, just position: any items collected will stay collected after death, and saving is only really needed when quitting, as there is no volatile progress in need of saving.\n\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nIf you are a fan of Zelda-like games and have 10 bucks to spare, give the game a go. As with any Steam game, however, waiting for a discount is probably the best course of action, as the $5 I bought the game for was the perfect price for the game in my opinion (but then again, I don't like paying for things, so there's that).\n\n--\nP~M","June 20, 2014","true","8.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Odds are, you'll like this too.\n\nAnodyne is a definite Zelda clone, but that's not a bad thing.\n\nLike Zelda, it has a (kinda) open world for you to explore, with a number of dungeons to keep you busy inbetween. While I wouldn't say that the music is iconic, the soundtrack does create an excelent atmosphere throughout the entire game. (I found myself humming along to one of the overworld themes.)\n\nThe game looks great and controls very smoothly. And it is certainly not without its challenges. I can't say it's the hardest game of its type that I've played, not by a long shot, but it's certainly far from being easy.\n\nThe game isn't ALL upsides though. More than once when playing, I felt that some of the difficulty seemed... artificial. what I mean by that is, I felt on quite a few occasions that a part of the game was hard because it was annoying or repeditive, instead of actually challenging my skill at the game. that said, this wasn't a thing that happened OFTEN, but just barely enough for me to notice.\n\nAnother possible issue is the length. I haven't beaten the game yet, but after just 2 hours of gameplay, I'm at the halfway point of the game.

It's an overhead adventure, in which you explore the world and dungeons as well as you can. To progress throughout the game, you generally must find cards that will help you unlock gates throughout the game that require different amounts of cards. In order to get to the end of the normal, story-section part of the game, you have to investigate places well to find every last card, giving plenty of playability and exploration that doesn't grow too stale or ambigious as new challenges arise to getting each card. You may have to pay attention and give patience, but if you're trying, nothing during the normal gameplay is impossible to find out. In what is technically post-game, you gain no real rewards for what you do except unlocking a few interesting levels. A lot of the post-game items almost guarentee that you use a guide, as they are very hidden and cryptic. However, you don't have to do any of this post-game, and most of these items are pointless anyway unless you're a completionist freak. All of the post-game cards (not hidden items in general) must be found to unlock a special last area, which again doesn't serve too much of a point, but it's a sweet area and gives a sense of accomplishment. There are only two things that I would shame the game in terms of gameplay for, and that is that: 1. when you gain the jumping ability, you cannot jump over enemies or projectiles as you would logistically think, and 2. you can only have one save file, meaning that if you want to replay the game  for a speed-running achievement, you must give up your long and hard progression of card collecting. However, those serve as minor details, and the game is still extremely enjoyable.\nIf you ever wanted to do the famous "are videogames art?" argument, this game would be an excellent example for proving so. Everything about this game is beautiful, to the point where I'm still thinking about it almost daily, even when I have completed it several months ago. This game is intended to be the exploration into the mind of Young, which means that everything is somewhat of a pre-set dream. And Hell, it truly is like a dream. The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful, and fits each individual event or area all too well. The graphics are purposely 16-bit-esque, which gives the atmosphere a surreal sense and further helps move the game's intentions of the whole story. The whole plot is an ambigious exploration throughout Young's mind, which brings up so much symbolism. You could hire the most advanced English professors of the world to try to dissect this game, and even then there would be so many possibilities as to how you could interpret almost anything. Even the very existence of characters in this dream world are controversial as to what they mean. Some themes of the game are given to you on a plate, and whether or not some purposes of the game are clear or ambigious to you, they all share ideas that the most troubled in life may have, and they may easily reflect into individuals on a personal level. This is not a "princess is captured, go save her" kind of plot for the thick-headed, and that is definitely an up-side.\nThis game is a masterpiece. If you a few good hours to sit down and play videogames each day, or if you ever wonder about your dreams or life in general, you have to play this. The ten dollars are so worth it.","January 3, 2014","true","20.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

You play as the silent protagonist Young in a real-time top-down action RPG. Armed with his trusty broom, Young sets out to battle the forces of... his mind? The game is curiously unclear about this. Going by in-game text only, it's anyone's guess where you are - Limbo? Someone's dream? Tartarus? A video game?\n\nThe first thing you are told is that you must reach something known as the Briar before darkness does. Young thus sets out on his journey to collect keys and cards in order to unlock gates in order to enter the next area. While keys make sense, it's peculiar that many gates require a certain number of cards to access. This wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for the fact that the last gate requires obtaining nearly all the cards, and so you must do a lot of backtracking to find what you were missing.\n\nThe game plays out in a number of different, often disjointed areas, notably modern ones. They range from streets, to caves, to suburbs, to hotels. It's cool, and it's well-drawn, but there's seemingly no coherence. Even if it's a dream world, there's no rhyme or reason ever given for why you may suddenly find yourself in an 8-bit dungeon. There's a town where you can go around stabbing npcs with a sword. It's creepy and unsettling, much like the music in the game, but you just accept it and move on. I feel there were some missed opportunities to expand upon these mysterious worlds.\n\nIf there's one thing I want in the game, it's more items. Early on you are given your trusty broom, which is a fair enough starter weapon. But throughout the entire game you never get anything different. You can obtain alternative attack patterns, but in the end it's still a broom. The only other power you obtain is jumping (and eventually another late-game power). You don't even learn to dash. I would have liked ranged attacks, learn to set fire to things, communicate with the strange walkers, etc.\n\nAnodyne boasts a remarkable large world map and a half a dozen moderately sized dungeons. While it can get a little confusing where to go sometimes, merely heading for parts of the map you haven't explored often sets you on the right path. The maps are fairly well constructed and have a nice open feel to them. I like that switches to open doors will often keep the door open so you don't have to repeat most difficult rooms you come across. There's some good enemy variety too, with unique AI patterns for each type of enemy you face. The boss battles are appropriately intense and often involved some gimmick. They have many varied attack patterns and genuinely feel like bosses, so good marks on that.\n\nThe game runs pretty well overall. I did occasionally clip into terrain, but other than that, there were no major bugs I found. I give Anodyine a 7/10. It doesn't quite live up to the legacy of Zelda, but it does manage to hold its own. Anodyone is a very commendable game to be accomplished with such a small team. I would have liked a more fleshed out story but I understand that's not what they were going for.","November 28, 2015","true","5.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldeenaxe/recommended/234900/","goldeenaxe",".png","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldeenaxe/","232 products in account","Anodyne labels itself ‘as an adventure through a dream world’. You play as Young, a stand in for a gloomy teenager armed with a broom, as he fights his way through what appears to be his own sub-conscious. Ill-at-ease, it’s appropriate that Young has constructed a world filled with his own inner-demons. These have been manifested in the form of 16-bit pixelated creatures and though not every enemy is harmful, they compound the misery further providing Young with a series of challenges to overcome. As the game progresses, it becomes more and more clear that Young’s sub-conscious houses many of his own personal mistakes, guilt and haunting memories and for a game that seems at first obtuse, it serves to reveal more of itself over time. However, whether Young has slipped into this nightmare accidentally, or whether he’s trying to escape from the real world remains a mystery up until the end. Your goal becomes to collect an assortment of 36 cards which are hidden all across the land, taking on dungeons and demons including a series of talkative boss fights in order to restore peace to the young Young’s mind.\n\nWhilst many of Anodyne’s principles are rather unique, its form is purposefully constructed to be similar to adventure games principally found on the Game Boy Colour or the Super Nintendo. The game’s visuals are unnervingly similar right down to the isometric screens which slide around as you move up, down, left and right. The gameplay mirrors this further by replicating the exact style of games such as Zelda: Link’s Awakening or the Oracle of Ages/Time Saga even down to the enemies and bosses of who invoke a look eerily similar to numerous Zelda-style demons from over the years. Whereas the game looks and plays a lot like Nintendo’s primary adventure game right down to its multiple world-styles ranging from forest to urban to grassland to desert and beach, it draws influences from a broader range of classic Nintendo games. There is a strange wondrous sense of joy which comes from exploring the landscape which is best represented by Pokemon, and then there’s the sheer madness of the landscape and all of its inviting, and often dangerous, oddities which draws further into Earthbound-territory. With Andoyne’s own references towards the movement from childhood to adulthood and its infatuation with urban environments it seems to want to pay homage to these games, but at the same time fuel its own desire for creative content with the deconstruction of these game’s tropes.\n\nThe game begins innocently enough as you take control of Young as he finds himself alone a dusty, deserted street. There is with little real explanation as to why you are here but you are soon instructed by one of the game’s various sages about a perilous journey which you must take. Soon you(ng) find yourself in areas such a hotel, a haunted forest, an ominous hotel, and a dangerous circus act. While these vary in original, the point of them is made to represent previous venues where traumatic childhood memories, or perhaps mere childish fears, have occured. The dialogue presented from characters certainly pushes towards believing that this are moments manifested from Young’s thoughts and this plays into self-reflexivity which the game wishes to stress. It also ensures that, while the game is vague, there is at least an element of explanation which ensuring that there is something understandable about the traumatic memories taking place. As an example of this, during the circus dungeon there is a remark told to you about a fatal accident which once took place to a trapeze artist who lost their balance and fell to their death. It reads like a newspaper cutting which young would have found and nods towards the act as an imaginative episode which Young's own pensive thoughts had created. Played out in reality, this becomes a fearful expanse into the world of a child looking upon things with disorientation. Another dungeon, which takes place principally in a hotel, acts out as if it has come straight from the thoughts of a young child away from home, unable to grasp his new surroundings.\n\nThis is where Anodyne’s intentions lay. It’s a scared little boy in the world of big games but it holds its angst as a point of its creation. Just as with Young, Anodyne wants to be liked so he tries his best to look normal but the game isn’t interested in one-dimensional characters. It takes a big step towards presenting Young as a character filled with emotions by subverting many of the expectations we would traditionally have with retro-style adventure games. It’s a little heavy on the angst but that’s a draw to Anodyne: a game which knows its own visual limitations and plays with them in a manner which deliberately asks us why we don’t tend to want to know more about the characters which we control. Perhaps there’s something of the creators, Sean Hogan and Jonathan Kittaka own fears which have made their way into this game. Either way, they’ve done a good job with Anodyne making it stand out with purpose and subtle enough to pass as an enjoyable nod back to older adventure games for those more interested in nostalgia than messages.\n\nTL;DR: I'd buy it on sale.","May 20, 2014","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

The story of Anodyne is abstract and ‘weird’ and may come off in a way that becomes unappealing.

The music in this game also does a wonderful job of creating a very mood altering atmosphere.

Anodyne presents a rich, mysterious, and at times hilarious world to explore.  It completely captures the sense of adventure that so many games today lack.  The world is rich with secrets, collectables, unique characters, and absurdity.  There's entire areas you can't even reach until after you've completed the main game, so you completionist will have plenty to work for.\n\nAnodyne is not completly perfect though.  While the world it presents is a blast to get lost in, some of the gameplay mechanics are a bit wonky.  The jumping is a pain, and can cause some frustration as the game later tries to introduce some platforming mechanics.  Some of the ememies can also be a huge pain to get in on and attack, but for the most part your huge health bar keeps it balanced.  Also using an Xbox one controller I had to reprogram the controls every time I turned on the game.  The D-pad also never worked, which is a huge shame as it could have gone a long way to over come some of the problems I faced with the jumping mechanics.\n\nOverall this game is a gem though.

Story wise, the game has some very insightful moments, but, if there was a coherent subtext in the game, then I did not get it.  If there is a deeper narrative that the designers had in mind, then it is buried deep.

But there's no excuse for this. Anodyne is an Action-Adventure game that draws heavy influence from the Legend of Zelda series, along with Yume Nikki (a surreal, horrorfying exploration game). Unlike LoZ, almost everything is amateurish in this game; the animations, the sprites, level design - it just all seems really poor. Unlike Yume Nikki, the atmosphere that the game presents is cheesy and trite. I never got that "dreamlike" vibe from the game just because of how clumsily it presented itself.  Many of the enemies you encounter don't even look like they belong in the area they reside in. The soundtrack can be hit-or-miss but is mediocre for the most part.\n\nAfter defeating 3 ridiculously easy bosses, I lost interest and motivation to continue trying to make sense of the cryptic plot  - which was the only thing keeping me from quitting the game earlier.","April 23","false","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unfortunately, the best I can say about the sum of its parts is that it's merely an "average" game -- perhaps worth a playthrough if you're desperate for a Zelda-like gameplay experience, but better off left on the proverbial shelf otherwise.\n\nAt its best, the gameplay is enjoyable and reasonably challenging. While not nearly as polished as its inspiration, it's not too difficult to look past things such as the lack of hitbox refinement, flighty controls, and strange overworld design. Other flaws are a little harder to dismiss.\n\nPerhaps Anodyne's most glaring flaw is its story and character dialogue, which are all but incoherent. Yes, the dreamlike setting and premise of the game explain this design decision, but there are two kinds of dreams in life: First, there are the strange or eventful dreams that we relate to family or friends for a good laugh or an interesting tale. Second, the kind that are so bizarre that we wouldn't bother retelling them, because all we'd get in return are blank stares. Anodyne is more the latter than the former. The game would have been more enjoyable with no story at all.\n\nLastly, I'll note that the game is not particularly family friendly as the themes get darker (and the profanity stronger) further into the game. Obviously that's more applicable to some audiences than others.\n\nIn closing, while I can say I enjoyed the game enough to go for all the achievements, it's not something I'd want to play again in the future.

It may mean something or it may be style over substance (with regards to the story anyway), but the game itself is solid and playing it you can't help but get an uneasy feeling that this world is off.\n\nIt's hard to really describe this because of how unusual the story and tone fit with the play itself.  It's quite dark and often makes you question the meaning or motivation of many of the characters - but is there a deeper meaning to it?  I don't know.\n\nWhatever the case may be, I will recommend this if you like the zelda style of 2D action game.  It has some clever bits to it, as well as a rather different "weapon" that adds a neat little gimmick overall.

These are two instances of the game asking for roughly the same thing, for me to fiddle with speed pads and somehow jump diagonally over a ridiculously wide space. These jumps are why I am incapable of finishing this game. While I don't think they're impossible, they constitute a kind of false difficulty (in the sense that the game is asking me for finger dexterity whereas in most other situations it is just asking for puzzle solving), and I was not able to complete them. It's a shame for me, because I think this is a really cool game, with a much stronger appeal to me aesthetically than any Zelda game I have ever played. I came into it much easier because Zelda would often ask for that kind of fiddling very early on, whereas here it waited until right near the end to tell me I couldn't progress without a dexterity test.

This entire trend of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games sold as "Indie", "Retro" or "Old-School" is really starting to get on my nerves! I don't mind the lack of voice acting, I don't need long and gorgeous cut-scenes, I can live with the shallow storylines, I can also deal with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics in general. But what really drive me nuts are the small things, such as, for example, me being able to hit an enemy from 100 miles away.... with a melee weapon! Nevermind the fact that all I really hit was air, the monster on the other corner of the screen just dies and disappears.\n\nFor me, this is a game breaker. It's like the game devs are telling me, "Hey, it's a fantasy game, right? You only imagine you're an adventurer, you only imagine you're fighting monsters, so what's wrong with imagining you really hit the bat right before it died?"  Well, at this point I put on my Grumpy Cat mask and shout, "NO! I won't friggin' imagine that! It's your job as game devs to illustrate at least the most basic stuff!".\n\nNeedless to say, that if in the past I generously shelled out money for indie games without digging too deep, thinking to myself that even if I won't be enjoying the game, at least I'd be supporting the games industry, that is not the case anymore. I'm tired of lazy game devs selling me crap as "Indie". I'm willing to pay for good games, but I work hard to earn that money, and so should everyone else, including game developers.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, Anodyne is a bad game.

For better or worse, it cribs a lot of its style from Zelda. Clear dungeon, get items, progress to new area, rinse and repeat. While I feel that it works for the most part, I think the best aspects of Anodyne are the outlandish game play elements and presentation.\n\nThe fighting in this game is fairly one dimensional, and virtually every enemy is best approached by attacking and retreating. Honestly, this gets old pretty quickly and with only one weapon to use, you don’t have much variety in how you play. Coupled with the game’s emphasis of platforming that relies heavily on timing, Anodyne can be a bit frustrating and is best played in short spurts.\n\nThe greatest strength of Anodyne is its surreal presentation. Particularly, it’s bizarre scenery and dream-like setting, blending mundane and fantasy characteristics. Anodyne does a good job of providing a backdrop that feels like you’re exploring the protagonist’s subconscious. The off-beat aesthetics of the game are carried into the game play as well, as you’re given a broom (of all things) to use as your weapon. Some of the ways you can interact with puzzles and levels is clever, and really helps to make Anodyne feel more original than a Zelda clone.\n\nHaving said that, the game is probably best reserved for a sale or bundle purchase. While it’s definitely flawed, Anodyne is worth checking out and I’m looking forward to seeing what the developers come up with next.","November 16, 2013","true","16.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

With most games, that's a scary thought, but in Anodyne, it sounds like a great way to spend a night and soak in any details I missed.","December 25, 2013","true","6.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

When you look at it or when you first play it you get the feeling that it is an old game, similar to Zelda in some ways. The music is actually pretty charming and relaxing while you're exploring around. The gameplay is nothing spectacular nor does it have any unique mechanics, it is solid, it works, it basicly puts you on a quest to gather a bunch of cards in order to unlock certain doors and defeat certain bosses until you reach the final boss. Now what really intrigues me about the game is the actual storyline, as soon as you start the game you are given the task to fight the Briar who has spread the Darkness across the land but the more I played and progressed throughout the game the more I got confused. In the end I kinda got the feeling that Anodyne tells the story of 2 friends along with their upsides and downsides in their relationship. It's really weird and odd, hard to understand to me atleast. In the end I think that Anodyne has it's own merit and it's actually a pretty good title but only because of the story in my honest opinion.","October 2, 2013","true","10.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's very similar to Link to the Past game mechanically, in everything from the fighting to the way the temples work. The story is minimalistic and haunting, and while you play it you can't really shake the feeling that something is seriously wrong with this world.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BigBirdIII/recommended/234900/","BigBirdIII","Big Bird III","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BigBirdIII/","1503 products in account","[Spoiler-Free Review]\n\nAnodyne is an exploration game which borrows heavily from classic 2D Zelda titles (especially Link's Awakening). The dialogue is introspective, the subject matter is mature (sometimes even disturbing). It's also one of the strangest games I've ever played.\n\nExploration is at the core of the game. If Anodyne was a protest piece against hand-holding in video games it would be considered a masterpiece. You aren't given a whole lot of instruction regarding where to go next. This feels liberating, for the most part, as you alone are free to decide your next course of action. It's also intimidating and frustrating though, as getting lost/stuck at some point through your playthrough is pretty much a given. It's not necessarily bad game design, it's a product of having too open a world and too linear a path to success (i.e. to get past this next section, the player will have needed to speak with this person to get this item). There aren't many indicators letting you know whether you fulfill the prerequirements for an area so there's a lot of trial and error involved. Be patient or look up a guide.\n\nAll areas have their own themes and every dungeon offers up new challenges. This isn't the stereotypical fire/ice/earth/water stages type of game, the locales are varied and interesting: ranging from hotels to small towns and highway construction sites.\n\nThe soundtrack is excellent and deserves to be praised as such. It reminds me of EARTHBOUND most noticably. The atmosphere is palpable; brooding, imaginative, mysterious. I wish there was a sound test option to be able to listen to the soundtrack from the main title screen.\n\nAside from having a penchant for getting lost, the only other issues I'd express concerns about are the graphics and the flimsy gamepad controls.\n\nThe graphics are muddy and crude, utilizing a palette usually reserved for NES/GBC titles. They don't get in the way of the gameplay, but if you aren't a fan of pixel/sprite based games, you won't be convinced otherwise by Anodyne.\n\nAlthough the XBOX 360 Controller is supported, the controls for movement are mapped to the analog stick and are very loose. I'd like to say this is a matter of preference, but when you're down to one health bar and your character charges at an enemy with reckless abandon despite your best efforts to carefully evade said foes, it's an issue. Nothing can be more frustrating than losing due to struggles with controls. A simple option to control the character using the digital pad would remedy this issue but as it stands, it isn't an option. I ended up remapping my controls through the joytokey program and my enjoyment with the game increased immediately.\n\nIf you like exploration games and don't mind the graphics, pick this one up. It'll surprise you.\n\nP.S.\nAnodyne easily takes the title for strangest post-game I've ever experienced. It's beyond interesting.","September 2, 2013","true","20.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The entire game pushes that sort of aimless, wandering quality while dropping hints of what's at the heart of the game on a deeper philosophical level. Ultimately though, I found it a bit too aimless, and got bored a little over halfway through, when I discovered the only way to the end of the game was finishing a collection of cards, and relentlessly screen-hunting through a game that doesn't have any tracking system for if you've been to a place or not. While I have no issue doing it myself, the game wasn't compelling or entertaining enough to make me want to do it. The only puzzle mechanic was Roc's Feather style jumping, button pushing, and pushing dust around with a broom. No other puzzle, items, or anything to use. Bosses were unimaginative and felt like slogs, and even with the portals and jumping around, a great deal of the maps felt like empty needless filler, walking from place to place in what is, admittedly, a chamring, quirky (and sometimes fairly dark and entirely unsettling) little world, but filled with very little actual substance.\n\nI think that's what the game was trying to do, though, which means I can't really fault it for being exactly that. The game would get a neutral rating from me if I could give it one, so I'll recommend it and give it a positiv erevie wbecause I think the game is well done, it's just not a game for me.","April 8","true","2.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Puzzles reset if you leave the room which is both a blessing and a curse, since it seems puzzles and monsters will reset even if you've solved/killed them as well. This is annoying if you want to explore everything. I like the game, but there are aspects I dislike, such as the resets. Personally it bothers me enough to not want to play for stretches of time since I have to keep repeating things each time I go to a room.\n\nGraphics wise this game reminds me of old school Pokémon on the game boy, way back in those days before the dinosaurs were wiped out.\n\n\nWant to read more of my reviews?

For my surprise, it took me on a trip back down memory lane to times when all I had game-wise was a GBC (my beloved and so missed crystal clear Japanese edition, so rare in the Americas) with Pokémon Crystal and TLoZ: Oracle of Ages. I had that GBC throughout my teen years and I finished both Pokémon and TLoZ: OoA way too many times to count. Later when I was 18-19 I had the opportunity (after all those years) to play TLoZ: Orace of Seasons, a game I've always wanted to try out (and actually the one I wanted instead of OoA). I'm quite certain that Anodyne pays tribute to the GB-GBC TLoZ era, including Link's Awakening. Walking around some areas, I even felt like I was back at Labrynna due to how similar that particular spot was to another one in OoA. It's actually the first tribute game to make me nostalgic and if I used scores on my reviews, it would get a 10/10 just because of that.","November 26, 2015","true","3.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cognitiveagent/recommended/234900/","cognitiveagent","PariahDog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cognitiveagent/","776 products in account","ThemeThe game derives both its graphical style and its gameplay from the earlier Legend of Zelda games (Link's Awakening, and A Link to the Past), but does not do its source of inspiration any justice. Upon starting the game you are thrown in the deep end of the proverbial pool knowing nothing about the world, yourself, or what you are supposed to be doing. A brief few sentences cryptically inform you of your quest, and off you go. The apparent veil of mystery, however, never seems to be lifted. As you advance through the game you're not told what you are doing, why you are doing it, and why you should keep doing it. Instead you get some quasi-philosophical sentences randomly thrown in your direction, giving the game an air of pretentiousness.\n\nThe visual style of Anodyne is not necessarily bad, but it is severely limited by simplistic and repetitive tylesets without any unique or impressive structures to look forward to. It is nothing special, and it does not contribute much to the theme of the world, unless the theme is supposed to be bland and uninspiring.\n\n\nGameplayMuch like its visual style, the gameplay is very repetitive. Borrowing its base gameplay from the aforementioned Legend of Zelda titles, Anodyne does nothing new or spectacular with it. In fact, it does not even borrow the parts that make its source of inspiration such great games mechanically. In the Legend of Zelda you are constantly advancing by obtaining new items, requiring you to master these respective items and use them (often in combination with other items) to solve puzzles and advance through the game. Anodyne does nothing of the sort. It does not seem to grant you new accessories to work with, leaving the gameplay as bland and one-dimensional as it is from the very start. Transitioning between areas in the game is equally repetitive. Many screens just seem to be there as filler content to make the game world seem larger, but contribute nothing to the experience. You'll be walking around a lot, which coincidentally gives you a lot of time to ponder the meaning of it all.\n\nThe game controls well, although it lacks some polish here and there, particularly noticable while fighting bosses or certain enemies, or trying to circumvent certain obstacles.\n\nConclusionUnpolished, pretentious, bland, repetitive, and boring are the defining keywords of this game. While the game is not necessarily bad, it just doesn't do enough to be worth playing. If you are new to the genre, I can recommend trying the Legend of Zelda instead. If you are looking for a game similar to the Legend of Zelda, then this game will be a disappointment.\n\nIt does nothing new, and what it does is worse than its predecessors in the genre. Therefore it's safe to say this game can be skipped entirely.","September 9, 2015","false","1.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That being said, I can only suggest that you experience it for yourself.\n\nAs a side note, having a controller for this game is nice, but not necessary. I played through more than half of it with a keyboard.","November 18, 2013","true","10.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Often uninspired maze-levels with a few too many dead ends that just waste your time (would have been fine if there was something to explore or pickup at those deadends)\n-Broom/dust puzzels become very tedious after a few hours, especially when you are backtracking through dungeons trying to figure out where to go\n-Garbage story\n\nOverall, 6.5/10.

The music is good, the look is interesting, the gameplay is generally solid. It's not without flaws. When it comes to jumping, you will probably be swearing a lot because the game feels "slippery" when it comes to edges. There's also a fair bit of tedious exploring at the end of the game to get the necessary items to progress to the final area. But overall, it's a pretty solid and fun game that will take you between 3-6 hours to beat on your first try.","December 10, 2013","true","7.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

What? Like, one minute you're floating down a river on a pile of dust, the next you're falling down a whirlpool into a weird land with walking trees, and then you climb a windmill and get to outer space, which is ruled by cubes wih faces, but it's actually a hotel filled with evil ghostly cleaning ladies, and there's a town where everything's in black and white and shadows are chasing you and...well, don't get me started on the ending. It's ridiculously surreal.\n\nTherein lies Anodyne's brilliance--unlike Link's Awakening, which had some weirdness but was always internally consistent, Anodyne perfectly recreates the fuzziness and weirdness of an ACTUAL dream. And it does it well! A work of art, really.\n\nThe gameplay is great too, of course, standing on the shoulders of giants and whatnot.

A surreal, creepy take on the Zelda formula set in its protagonist's subconscious? Sign me up. Unfortunately, Anodyne fails not just at being a "deep" experience but at being a functional game.\n\nHit detection is terrible. The worst I've ever seen in a professional game. It's incredibly frustrating, especially when the game frequently demands pixel perfect movements from the player. It's tolerable until the jump boots are introduced, at which point I was frequently subjected to the clumsiest, buggiest platforming I've ever seen. Countless times my character would land on the edge of a platform, only to hang there for a second and then "slide" off. Either they didn't playtest this at all, or they were comfortable with such awful core gameplay. Not sure which is worse.\n\nThe creators implemented mercy invincibility, but seem unclear on the purpose of it. Your character is invincible for a fraction of a second after being hit, but flashes for much longer than that. Expect to take damage from the same enemy/attack 3-4 times before you can move him. Even regular enemies enjoy a much longer window of invincibility than you, making combat much slower and more annoying than it needed to be. Enemy attacks carry a huge amount of knockback, frequently ruining attempts at platforming sections.\n\nThe game is divided into about 50% dungeon crawling and 50% combing the map for cards.\n\nThe former is irritating because of the above mentioned problems. Puzzles are very simple; there wasn't a single one that required an ounce of thought once I had figured out the central mechanic. (Oh, I jump on this to make it move...time to do that 1000 times.) Bosses (with the exception of the more ambitious but terribly designed final boss) can be beaten just by rushing them and hitting them faster than they hit you. There's no strategy required, and you only have a single attack for the entire game.\n\nHunting for cards (which is mandatory) is a transparent way of extending the game's runtime. A few are cleverly hidden. The rest are just crammed in the most obscure, closed off nooks and crannies of the map. The cards do nothing besides unlock health containers, and, eventually, the path to the final boss. Even with this padding, Anodyne is very short. My blind playthrough, 100%ing the game and taking my time, took about five hours.\n\nFor a Zelda ripoff, Anodyne contains very few usable items. You get a broom (your weapon) and jump boots. Two optional upgrades very slightly change your broom's range, which feels like a cruel joke on anyone who wanted a varied gameplay experience. The only remotely novel gameplay element is an item that lets you swap two tiles, but it can only be used on a single, incredibly dull puzzle. Beating the game lets you use it anywhere, but since the only thing left to do at that point is go find more cards, I've yet to touch the post game content.\n\nOn the more superficial side of things, a lot of the buzz surrounding this game concerned its graphics and soundtrack. The graphics are fine if you're not tired of the whole 16 bit tribute thing by now. Apparently the main character wears a hoodie; I didn't realize this until it was pointed out in dialog. Most of the animations look sloppy.\n\nAs for the music, it is an absolute insult that the OST is being sold for $5. Anodyne has the worst "retro" game soundtrack I've ever heard: just tinny, low quality attempts at chiptunes. Nearly all of the tracks are short loops. Most of them are just forgettable in the "might as well be white noise" sense. A few stand out as so awful I had to mute the game to make it through their respective areas. Even if I loved this game, I wouldn't spend a cent on the soundtrack.\n\nAs far as the plot, writing, atmosphere...the things that interested me about this game? Disappointing.\n\nThere's very little actual plot. The premise is you're the chosen one on a quest to save the land from the darkness. That's the exact language the game uses, and it thinks it's being clever as it bashes you over the head with it. It broadcasts its only real twist from minute one, and doesn't subvert this premise in any significant way. The ending is about twenty seconds long: nothing explained, a cheesy joke and a fade to black. ♥♥♥♥ that.\n\nBefore playing this, I saw a few reviews that noted that the tone was all over the place. Which I thought would be interesting. The game cycles you through generic video game tropes, horror, and humor. Unfortunately, the writer isn't strong enough to juggle these ideas. The horror elements aren't scary enough, and the jokes not funny enough, to be welcome, interesting or justified. I couldn't shake the sense that Anodyne was a dumping ground for every single idea the developers had, but without a decent design plan the various pop culture references and spooooky uterus themed dungeons never become anything more than the sum of their parts.\n\nAnd it's all pointless anyway, since the game expects you to forget about these weird asides the moment they end. We're left with a very boring, standard video game fantasy plot with some token ambiguity about what it all might mean. But again, the writing is just not strong enough to make you care about that.\n\nIf Anodyne had been free, I might have a more charitable opinion of it. It has some interesting ideas, but the developers lacked the ability or willingness to refine them. But I paid $3.50 for it and am walking away feeling profoundly ripped off. The idea of paying $10 for it makes me nauseated.","September 16, 2015","false","6.5"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

At many times I would see something in the game and go "OH, really showing your roots there Anodyne, might as well just call your last boss Ganon and slap on a green hat..."  but then, I did something that really helped me appreciate the game, and games in general, for that matter.  I stopped evaluating it with respect to other games.  I considered it by itself.\n\nThe art style is beautiful, and it's not fair to say that just because other games have succeeded using a pixel art aesthetic that Anodyne is just riding their coattails.  Is it true?  Maybe.  Is is a fair criticism?  No.  It's really not.  Look at the game again and tell me it isn't beautiful.  I spent so much time in the world of Anodyne not because I miss my old Link's Awaknening game, but because it was a world in which I truly enjoyed to be.\n\nSo, the moral of the story is this:  you can tell me that the game lacked meaning, or didn't appeal to you, or that you didn't like the art style or humor or direction or pacing or any other legitimate complaint.  Just at least give it the credit to evaluate it by its OWN merits.\n\nThe platforming is fun and challenging, the myriad of ways in which the designers have you exploring the broom mechanic is brilliant, the characters are quirky and fun, the world is gorgeous, and I truly enjoyed every part of this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KafroHudrep/recommended/234900/","KafroHudrep","Kafro Hudrep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KafroHudrep/","352 products in account","Anodyne is a game which I bought for $3 along with a bundle of other assorted indie games. Having finished it, I can wholeheartedly recommend it, even at full price, for it imparts simplicity, solitude, and subtlety that I find rather underappreciated or ignored these days.\n\nThe story, ostensibly about a human named Young attempting to protect "The Briar" from "The Darkness" that has spread across "The Land", would be rather uninteresting if it were not for how the game's description directly states that it all takes place within Young's subconscious. Resulting from this is a somewhat lonely journey which focuses more on succinct phrases rather than grandiose spiels and atmosphere over tangibility, overall akin to going through a series of dreams within a larger dream (which is no surprise as Yume Nikki is cited as one of the inspirations for this game). Later on in the game the ideas and caricatures presented occasionally get a bit too obtuse for me to understand, but the main theme of the plot is still clear and I was quite satisfied by the ending. Moreover, Anodyne never interrupts its gameplay for an extended period of time to exposit or pontificate, which is nice as it means players are not forced to care about the game's script if they do not want to. That would be a shame, however, as the multiple lines of dialogue from the game's NPCs and signs tend to be incredibly humorous or chilling, sometimes both at the same time.\n\nMechanically, the game is not particularly complex; imagine Link's Awakening but with no items outside of the Sword and the Roc's Feather. Although Young gains several equippable upgrades throughout the course of the game, the majority of them just increase the range of his broom, and the enemy and obstacle counts are not particularly high either. As such, the majority of the game consists of exploring the overworld (surprisingly large and spanning multiple environments), slaying enemies (both passive and aggressive), clearing dungeons (about as much as you'd expect in a Zelda game), vanquishing bosses (all of them uniquely designed and fairly tough), and ultimately collecting cards which are required to progress further in the game.\n\nNonetheless, the rooms of each dungeon tend to be designed well enough that old adversaries often offer new challenges. There are also some tricky puzzles and platforming sections as well, the latter sometimes becoming a bit too tricky due to the top-down perspective. Honestly though, there are only two points of contention I truly have with the gameplay. Firstly, the collection of said cards might put off players who do not enjoy backtracking and exploring EVERYWHERE. I was personally okay with it, though Young's mediocre movement speed made the task plodding at times. Secondly, the post-game is rather lackluster, basically furthering the card seeking with a late-introduced gimmick which can be hard to control along with literally exploiting glitches; it feels like an afterthought. Other than that, the simplicity of the game is a mark in its favor.\n\nMoving on to aesthetics, the game describes its visuals as "GBC/16-bit", which is certainly true and they are sprited very well in that style, but what really stood out to me were the gorgeous overlays that complimented many of the game's areas. I'm particularly a fan of the cliffs (pictured above), which are bathed in a warm sunset's glow, along with some later, gloomier areas which would be a shame to spoil. The sound design is excellent as well, especially the "Obtain Key" noise which is utterly jarring and I love it.\n\nContinued...","April 16, 2013","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

It's a top-down dungeon crawler that features a large and diverse open-world that makes exploration and discovery quite enjoyable. The game doesn't hold your hand and only offers some subtle hints of direction, although it's never really all that challenging in regards to its combat or puzzle-solving. The 16-bit pixel art style is really well done, thanks largely in part to the terrific use of color that makes for some beautiful locations. The soundtrack is memorable and helps set that dream-like atmosphere that the devs were going for. On the downside, the gamepad controls can be overly sensitive and jumping puzzles tend to become frustrating as a result. Also, while I like that the story is abtract and open to interpretation, it feels unfocused and seems to serve mostly as an excuse to explore some eccentric locales.\n\nIn all, Anodyne is a solid Zelda-clone that's able to thrive on its colorful artwork, well-designed dungeons, and a soundtrack that is worth the price of admission by itself.","April 25, 2013","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Young has to fight through various strange, sometimes nightmarish landscapes in order to fix the Briar.  You must fight monsters, push blocks, clear dungeons, and collect cards in your quest to do what Young feels he must do.\n\nIt has good enough controls, with your character being able to move about, hit things and move things. The jumping introduced halfway through feels too slippery, (the jumping puzzles for the hidden stuff feels sadistic) and I thought it could've used more equipment/movement options, but it's a fine enough action game. It's very Zelda, with a simple overworld that connects to various unique areas with their own dungeons, with the occasional bit of equipment you can use in other areas.\n\nIt has more of an atmosphere (alternating between dismal creepiness and cheerful wierdness) than a story, which is also fine considering the fantastic setting.  I think SNES Zelda + Yume Nikki + a hint of Earthbound describes both the pixel art and the writing. That sounds both massively cliched and referential as both a game and as my description, but I feel it covers the feel of the setting.\n\nI also really liked that it focused on this dream world; you never 100% learn what the protagonist's deal is, besides some obvious allusions.  You're just along for part of Young's spritual journey.  The sound design, both in the soundtrack and the FX, compliments the retro graphical design.  The music is particullarly strong; it perfectly fits the game's dreamy oddness.\n\nIt also has a post-game thing about finding (more) cards, ??? items, and fiddling with tile-swapping that really alternates between fun and fustrating.

With The legend of Zelda: a Link to the Past being on of my favorite games of all time I just had to give this a download and was not dissapointed.\n\nThe gameplay is very reminiscent of old school ALTTP/Links awakening Zelda with an emphesis on puzzle solving and revisiting previous locations. During the game you will come across gates that require cards to get through. The game gives you enough cards to let you experience tha base game but becomes much more difficult and unique with its puzzles if you want to enter the deepest areas of the games.\n\nThe game world is very large and extremely varied with many different locales that can be traversed in a very non-linier fashion. Very late into the game you may notice that you are missing a large number of collectables and will gain an ability unlike any other game in order to fully explore the nooks and crannies of the maps. While doing this you will also be able to discover some very well hidden easter eggs from other indie titles.\n\nThe story is vary sparse and leaves a lot of the reaction up to the player to figure out in an attempt to understand the world you are currently in.\n\nThe soundtrack incredibly well done and can range from slightly eerie and mysterious to down right scary in some sections.\n\nOverall I cannot recommend this game enough for anyone who enjoys Zelda-like, puzzle or artistic games, or something that requires massive amounts of world exploration.","June 24, 2013","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wasn't expecting much going in, but it ended up being enjoyable by the end of it. (Now if only we could open that 50-card door...)\n\nAnodyne has some strong points and good moments that I won't spoil here. It's worth the asking price if you're a fan of the 2D Zeldas, but it needs some polish to be truly *great*.\n\nFor starters, as a first impression, when first running the game it asked me to adjust the window's size with the arrow keys (what game does this?), which couldn't even be held down to change the size and then proved to be completely useless when I could just change the settings to presets in the menu later. I understand this was originally made in Flash but the PC port should be more standardized with the resolution and other options.\n\nThere's quite a few dead-ends that *look* meaningful, but are really nothing of use and that makes the world feel more empty than it should be. Also the overworld could have been much more interesting but instead is just a bunch of mostly arbitrarily-placed portals to the different levels, of which have no labels to identify them aside from the small screenshot of the area (heck, even the signs in the levels are worn away and as such don't tell you where you're going).\n\nMy other critique would be that the pacing/story should be stronger. Finding the protagonist's signature broom is simply a plain chest in a plain room. The item itself is hilarious because there's nothing special about it and yet it's the weapon for the whole game, but the moment of getting it shouldn't have been so plain.\n\nOverall, Anodyne is fairly imprssive considering it was made in 10 months by 2 developers, but it could have used more polish to really stand out as something greater than a Zelda-inspired dungeon-crawler.","April 16, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yeah, the game is definitely bizarre.  It’s also very fun and intriguing. There are a number of things that happen in the game you certainly don’t expect, but that’s not saying much from a game like this.

When I started the game, it seemed like it was going to be a decent Zelda clone, but after the first half hour roughly that didn't pan out quite as much as anticipated.\n\nI did enjoy some aspects of the game such as the "hub' world, but even that quickly turned to a highly confusing area for me. Honestly the problem is that I just couldn't follow along with the story or where I was supposed to be going at any given point. Exploration rewarded me in hitting improbable areas or back tracking where I had already been. There was just no clear path of what/where I should be heading.\n\nI can certainly appreciate the depth and overarching story that exists, but this was just not the game for me.","July 27, 2014","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's delightfully atmospheric and the game's creators are masters of tone, making clever use of classic visuals and music to evoke feeling very well. However, gameplay quickly grows repetitive, and the exploration is much more confined than the games it was clearly inspired by, such as the Legend of Zelda series. The story is bare-bones yet still interesting, with interesting moments woven into the gameplay, such as attempting to talk to a fisherman but ending up accidentally murdering him because the game makes you attack instead, resulting in a bloody whirlpool in the ocean.\n\nThe game ultimately feels more like a rough draft or a demo of a much more fascinating, fully fleshed out game.

I wasn't expecting much going in, but it ended up being enjoyable by the end of it. (Now if only we could open that 50-card door...)\n\nAnodyne has some strong points and good moments that I won't spoil here. It's worth the asking price if you're a fan of the 2D Zeldas, but it needs some polish to be truly *great*.\n\nFor starters, as a first impression, when first running the game it asked me to adjust the window's size with the arrow keys (what game does this?), which couldn't even be held down to change the size and then proved to be completely useless when I could just change the settings to presets in the menu later. I understand this was originally made in Flash but the PC port should be more standardized with the resolution and other options.\n\nThere's quite a few dead-ends that *look* meaningful, but are really nothing of use and that makes the world feel more empty than it should be. Also the overworld could have been much more interesting but instead is just a bunch of mostly arbitrarily-placed portals to the different levels, of which have no labels to identify them aside from the small screenshot of the area (heck, even the signs in the levels are worn away and as such don't tell you where you're going).\n\nMy other critique would be that the pacing/story should be stronger. Finding the protagonist's signature broom is simply a plain chest in a plain room. The item itself is hilarious because there's nothing special about it and yet it's the weapon for the whole game, but the moment of getting it shouldn't have been so plain.\n\nOverall, Anodyne is fairly imprssive considering it was made in 10 months by 2 developers, but it could have used more polish to really stand out as something greater than a Zelda-inspired dungeon-crawler.","April 16, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Young has to fight through various strange, sometimes nightmarish landscapes in order to fix the Briar.  You must fight monsters, push blocks, clear dungeons, and collect cards in your quest to do what Young feels he must do.\n\nIt has good enough controls, with your character being able to move about, hit things and move things. The jumping introduced halfway through feels too slippery, (the jumping puzzles for the hidden stuff feels sadistic) and I thought it could've used more equipment/movement options, but it's a fine enough action game. It's very Zelda, with a simple overworld that connects to various unique areas with their own dungeons, with the occasional bit of equipment you can use in other areas.\n\nIt has more of an atmosphere (alternating between dismal creepiness and cheerful wierdness) than a story, which is also fine considering the fantastic setting.  I think SNES Zelda + Yume Nikki + a hint of Earthbound describes both the pixel art and the writing. That sounds both massively cliched and referential as both a game and as my description, but I feel it covers the feel of the setting.\n\nI also really liked that it focused on this dream world; you never 100% learn what the protagonist's deal is, besides some obvious allusions.  You're just along for part of Young's spritual journey.  The sound design, both in the soundtrack and the FX, compliments the retro graphical design.  The music is particullarly strong; it perfectly fits the game's dreamy oddness.\n\nIt also has a post-game thing about finding (more) cards, ??? items, and fiddling with tile-swapping that really alternates between fun and fustrating.

During the game you will come across gates that require cards to get through. The game gives you enough cards to let you experience tha base game but becomes much more difficult and unique with its puzzles if you want to enter the deepest areas of the games.\n\nThe game world is very large and extremely varied with many different locales that can be traversed in a very non-linier fashion. Very late into the game you may notice that you are missing a large number of collectables and will gain an ability unlike any other game in order to fully explore the nooks and crannies of the maps. While doing this you will also be able to discover some very well hidden easter eggs from other indie titles.\n\nThe story is vary sparse and leaves a lot of the reaction up to the player to figure out in an attempt to understand the world you are currently in.\n\nThe soundtrack incredibly well done and can range from slightly eerie and mysterious to down right scary in some sections.\n\nOverall I cannot recommend this game enough for anyone who enjoys Zelda-like, puzzle or artistic games, or something that requires massive amounts of world exploration.","June 24, 2013","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At many times I would see something in the game and go "OH, really showing your roots there Anodyne, might as well just call your last boss Ganon and slap on a green hat..."  but then, I did something that really helped me appreciate the game, and games in general, for that matter.  I stopped evaluating it with respect to other games.  I considered it by itself.\n\nThe art style is beautiful, and it's not fair to say that just because other games have succeeded using a pixel art aesthetic that Anodyne is just riding their coattails.  Is it true?  Maybe.  Is is a fair criticism?  No.  It's really not.  Look at the game again and tell me it isn't beautiful.  I spent so much time in the world of Anodyne not because I miss my old Link's Awaknening game, but because it was a world in which I truly enjoyed to be.\n\nSo, the moral of the story is this:  you can tell me that the game lacked meaning, or didn't appeal to you, or that you didn't like the art style or humor or direction or pacing or any other legitimate complaint.  Just at least give it the credit to evaluate it by its OWN merits.\n\nThe platforming is fun and challenging, the myriad of ways in which the designers have you exploring the broom mechanic is brilliant, the characters are quirky and fun, the world is gorgeous, and I truly enjoyed every part of this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaocrat/recommended/234900/","kaocrat","kaocrat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaocrat/","259 products in account","Recommended if you like open-ended exploration/adventure games.\n\nIf it weren't for the graphics, most of Anodyne could have been done as a ROM hack of the old GameBoy game Link's Awakening. The basic game mechanics are very close in look and feel to a Zelda game, particularly Link's Awakening. Like that game, the levels are laid out as a series of static screens which scroll when you reach the edge. The main character can move in 8 directions and attack in 4 directions, as well as jump over 1-tile sized pits and patches of spikes. The game controls are simple and responsive and best played with a gamepad or joystick.\n\nLike most of these types of games, Anodyne can get boring at times especially if you get lost or stuck at a point where you don't know what to do next. There's no leveling up or even an economy in this game so if you don't know what to do next or where to go, then you are pretty much going to be stuck wandering around aimlessly with nothing to show for your time until you get back on track. Fortunately the game has a central "hub" world with lots of warp points which makes it relatively painless to navigate from place to place. Additionally there is a good auto-map feature to reduce backtracking, and each of the warp points has a red gem above it which lights up when you have gathered all of the quest items within a given area, so you won't spend time needlessly re-exploing a region if there's nothing else to find.\n\nThe core experience consists of exploring puzzle-filled dungeons in search of treasure chests containing "cards" which are used to open up numbered gates which block off different areas of the overworld. Each gate requires you to have a certain number of cards in your collection before it will open. You explore dungeons to get cards, and you use cards to access new parts of the overworld so you can access more dungeons and hence more cards, etc. A few of the dungeons have boss fights as well.\n\nCombat is not as frequent or as intense as in a zelda game - the enemies are mostly slow moving, fairly passive, and come in small numbers. Later in the game there are a few challenging sections, but for the most part enemies are essentially "obstacles you can kill". They do however factor into many of the dungeon puzzles in interesting ways.\n\nWithin the dungeons, progress from room to room usually requires some combination of defeating all the enemies in a room to lower a gate, using a key to open a door, or solving a puzzle to remove some obstacle.\nUnlike a Zelda game, Anodyne has very few treasures or special items to expand your abilities. Instead, puzzles are solved with the standard ability set and whatever is in the envirionment. Most puzzles involve devising ingenious ways to trigger multiple pressure plates at the same time, while other puzzles require precision jumping and are essentially top-down platforming. I have to give the designer a lot of credit here as the level layouts and puzzles are really very well done and better than most of what you see in the zelda series. One puzzle involves chasing giant silverfish creatures, which retreat from you when you cross their line of sight, onto pressure plates. The silverfish change their facing by 90 degrees at regular intervals, and you have to make sure to chase them in the right direction lest they be driven into spikes or full down a pit. I was reminded of sneaking past groups of guards in the Metal Gear games, except in this case instead of trying to sneak through an area undetected, you are sneaking around to ensure that you will be detected at the exact right place and time. Another creature-based puzzle reminded me of the Dreamcast game Chu Chu Rocket, and involves toggling a switch to raise and lower obstacles within a maze-like area so that a giant rat will pass over a pressure plate. Upon bumping into an obstacle, the rat will turn 90 degrees and keep moving forward. The trick is to time the raising and lowering of obstacles so that the rat turns in the direction you want it to go and doesn't run off to its own destruction. Other types of puzzles involve leaping from moving platforms, riding rafts made out of dust, or luring armored creatures into the path of turret fire so that you can use them as shields. Conspicuously (thankfully) absent are puzzles where you have to push blocks around, pull a series of levers in a specific order, or toggle a timed switch and then run through an obstacle course before the timer runs out.\n\nVisually, the game is 8-bit style pixel art but with a considerably expanded color palette. The scenery is varied from area to area and very well done. Music is minimal and perfect in that it adds to the atmosphere but does not intrude. Sound effects are very zelda-ish, with plenty of audio cues when you discover something or solve a puzzle or anything along those lines.\n\nThe overall theme and story was incomprehensible to me. None of the characters or settings fit together in a way that I could understand, and the overall feeling of the game is less like the exploration of another world and more like wandering through a dream. Whether the creator was attempting at some kind of post-modern symbolism with all of the elements in the game or was going for literal surrealism, I don't know. It all went over my head but I will say that the mood created by the various locations and characters was interesting in its own right even if it didn't end up amounting to much of anything (at least to me).\n\nUpon completion of the main quest you are given a special ability which makes it possible to explore previously inaccessible areas of the map and collect additional cards. I didn't bother with this but for completionists it's nice that there's some additional content there.\n\nOverall a positive experience and a good contemplative sort of game to play when you don't have the energy for a faster paced game, nor the attention span for an RPG. It's the rare sort of comfort-food game that you can settle into and play in a relaxed state of mind.","July 11, 2014","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story stars with a character named young waking up to find himself in a dreamrelm. He then comes across a sage who says he is the chosen one and must   defeat the creatures in order to escape. What makes the story special is how the bosses and NPC's seem to have different ideas about what is going on and sharing them with you. The gameplay is very similar to the old Legend of Zelda games. Both have an overhead view and use a weapon for stabbing your enemies. The main differences come with the limited items and main weapon. You use a broom throughout the game to dispatch enemies and activate switches and the only usable item you obtain is some jumping shoes that allow you to jump which is used allot in later areas. The game looks fantastic with a retro art style. It fits the world and setting nicely and the game isn’t afraid of some dark tones when it wants to. The settings are also quite unique where you find yourself in a hotel or a strange universe instead of your usual dungeons and temples. Music is nice most of the time and has some nice tracks that I wouldn’t mind downloading. Anodyne mages to bring back the dying overhead action adventure genre and does it in such a well way. The game may only be 5-6 hours long but it is well worth the money and it was only made by two guys in less than a year.

There is a lack of polish--simply too many flaws for me to consider this game "complete" and worth the price:\n\n--The jump mechanics are among the worst I have ever encountered. This might not seem like a major issue, but jumping becomes an essential aspect of the gameplay, and it is incredibly frustrating to repeatedly die at certain points due to vague collision detection and poor controls. It didn't feel difficult because it required skill, but instead because it felt clunky and unpolished. I never found myself thinking, "I did it! Cool! That was hard but rewarding!" but rather, "Thank god that's over--hopefully I don't encounter that sort of thing ever again!"\n\n--There were bugs noticeable enough to hamper gameplay. On several occasions, I fell into a pit, respawned, and then randomly found my character teleported back into the pit (thus taking double damage for a fall). In one instance, I somehow respawned from one room into another and found myself irreversibly stuck in a pit until I died. There were also a few times where the game went unresponsive, but I suspect that this is a mac compatibility issue. (These weren't the only bugs--there were troubles with water, for instance, and collision detection in general--but the ones mentioned were the most salient and annoying.)\n\n--The story seems like fragments from a crappy pseudo-philosophical dream. There is no real development,* the dialogue does not make a great deal of sense (though "dream"-like and ambiguous enough to lend it an illusion of depth and wisdom); in short, the game didn't really take off or make me "feel" anything. It was entertaining at times: there were glimpses of interesting story ideas and a coherent "style"; there were characters I tried/began to like; there were some exciting discoveries; there were interesting/unique areas that I wanted to somehow develop a nostalgic fondness for...but it all just fell sort of flat. In the end credits, the enemies are named in a "cast", but they are given extremely boring or otherwise obvious names ("The Wall"; "Frog"; etc.); I think this epitomized my experience: there were things, and things sort of happened, but ultimately it felt unmemorable and like something(s) was missing. I won't look back on this game with any feeling of warmth but instead with an attitude of "Yes, I played that. It had some good ideas, but meh. It was okay."\n\nIf you like exploration enough to disregard some bugs, frustrating mechanics, and lack of compelling narrative, go for it! Otherwise, I'd recommend maybe picking this up on sale and seeing what you think.\n\n\n*Even if lack of development is part of the "point"--e.g. existential uncertainty, absurdism, etc.--it doesn't "feel" right in this sort of game. Character development, surprising turns of narrative and anagnorises ("HE was the bad guy all along??" or "So THAT'S what that thing was!"), moments where the story "coils back" upon itself and redefines what has come before...this is all missing. There might be a place for bold Zelda-esque dream-like existentialism (where, perhaps, the clues unravel nothing and the journey leads to nowhere in particular), but it was not well executed here: the game is too "conventional" (it has a general sense of progress/story) and non-experimental enough for me to justify the lack of some sort of satisfying, interconnected, overarching narrative.","May 20, 2015","false","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, don't expect an ending that explains anything of the story nor wraps up tight very many loose ends.  It would seem that the developer ran out of funds or just got tired of the product and decided to cut the game short just at the moment your hopes are at their peak that you are about to reveal something epic and enlightening, only to dash them with one of the most unfulfilling endings I'd ever experienced in a game of this sort.  I'm sure, however, there are plenty of fans out there who will attempt to defend the game by claiming that this unfinished ending is meant to be cryptic somehow and you make of it what you will.  I simply say to that, were that the case, I still consider it a lazy way to not finish what you started.  So then, fun gameplay and lots of interesting secrets to find if you like Zelda clones, well-made and great story up to a point just when it begins to feel unfinished.  Real stinker of an ending when it could have easily been very epic.  I still recommend it to play through once and only once for anyone.","January 24, 2015","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is virtually identical featuring 2D graphics, similar combat, and puzzles. All that makes you wonder if you should actually play Anodyne instead of just playing Zelda, and frankly the answer to that is yes. While Anodyne is very similar gameplay wise, it really shines in aesthetic and the weird world it creates. The setting is one entirely of its own and it does surreal in a skillful way not often seen in video games. The story is also better than anything a Zelda game could ever offer by benefit of having an actual writer, though it can tend to wax philosophically which may not be everyone's cup of tea.

With The legend of Zelda: a Link to the Past being on of my favorite games of all time I just had to give this a download and was not dissapointed.\n\nThe gameplay is very reminiscent of old school ALTTP/Links awakening Zelda with an emphesis on puzzle solving and revisiting previous locations. During the game you will come across gates that require cards to get through. The game gives you enough cards to let you experience tha base game but becomes much more difficult and unique with its puzzles if you want to enter the deepest areas of the games.\n\nThe game world is very large and extremely varied with many different locales that can be traversed in a very non-linier fashion. Very late into the game you may notice that you are missing a large number of collectables and will gain an ability unlike any other game in order to fully explore the nooks and crannies of the maps. While doing this you will also be able to discover some very well hidden easter eggs from other indie titles.\n\nThe story is vary sparse and leaves a lot of the reaction up to the player to figure out in an attempt to understand the world you are currently in.\n\nThe soundtrack incredibly well done and can range from slightly eerie and mysterious to down right scary in some sections.\n\nOverall I cannot recommend this game enough for anyone who enjoys Zelda-like, puzzle or artistic games, or something that requires massive amounts of world exploration.","June 24, 2013","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music really sets the tone the developer wanted and the pixel art was beautifully done.

The ambiguous storyline may be a deal-break for some, so know what to expect before you purchase the game.\n\nWhat was bad:\nYour initial visit to each world is exciting, but the backtracking gets old. The problem is that Anodyne never enthralls the player enough to want to stick around. Just when you start to get immersed in a boss battle or a puzzle, the game decides to slow down.\n\nIf you like games that focus on exploration and have the patience it takes to explore the entire game, give Anodyne a chance.","May 21, 2014","true","18.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I Don’t Have Time For This Nonsense.Genre: Top Down Adventure and Puzzle Game.\nDeveloped & Published by: Analgesic Productions\nPlatform: Windows and Mac.\nBusiness Model: Base Game\nCopy Purchased by Myself Preamble\nAs time passes by, I've grown increasingly intolerant of games like Anodyne. I’m tired of games with the mechanical depth of kiddie pools that sell themselves as hugely deep experiences. These titles that think they’re saying something profound when most of the time I’m just bored by the subtext. It’s nonsense. It’s tiresome nonsense that Anodyne finds itself in. That does color my review a bit but I do think that I point out the troubles this game has well enough to talk about it. So, let’s talk.\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nAnodyne is billed as action adventure title tied with surreal and horror elements. With its 2D top-down view, the comparisons to a certain other franchise are easy to make. But look past the surface and you’ll find anything but. Anodyne is a game that’s hard to have fun with. The combat system is abrasively simple, if you can get the finicky controls to work with you. Besides moving around and a short jump, all you've got is a single weapon. Said weapon is a broom that acts like a sword and can only be "swept" in the direction you’re facing. You have no AOE attacks or ranged capabilities which makes your broom’s incredibly short reach aggravating. This creates some really problematic situations with both regular enemies (who take a heart a hit and will knock you back) and and boss battles. I should mention that boss fights are very basic. Just find the one place they won't be able to hit you with their highly predictable attacks and bash them over the head until they die. Rinse and repeat as often as necessary. Do, however, expect to restart often just to get past a couple of fights. I don't know what else I can say about this system other than it's awful and basic. There's no enjoyment to be found in it. Just as there's little joy to be found in the dungeon crawling.\n\nThe majority of the game is puzzle solving which involves a ton of walking around and hoping you stumble upon the right switch or key to get through a door you couldn't get past. Then walk back to that door and continue rinsing and repeating this process till you've gotten through the entire game. While collecting the 48 photographs of enemies you need to finish the game. Exploration is lacking because there’s no monetary system nor can you acquire new items to enhance your character. All you can do is look at the pixelart and survive long enough to make it to the next save point. A lot of the time its just slogging it through normal enemies in long battles of attrition through fights or dungeons.\n\nStory Thoughts\nThe story is this: Young, you must save >insert vague mention of land/mythical object here< from an >insert ominous vague evil here<! Now go through this door and just do it! That’s basically the best that the game ever explains itself. You're main goal is to find 48 photographs of enemies either by defeating them or finding them in treasure chests. Then, you win the game. That’s it. Of course, getting to those photographs requires getting through a whole lot of dungeons but you’re not even given the basic reasons to do this other than to do it. No princess in another castle or interesting characters to get attached to. Truly, the characters are the worst part about Anodyne. There’s only a couple of recurring characters who don’t have any personality and very limited agency in the game. They simply show up, say a few lines at you and then leave. None of the dialogue really cements that you should care. Just do it and get your achievements already.\n\nLegend of Zelda Comparisons\nHaving played all of the Gameboy Legend of Zelda titles multiple times over, I can say this with absolute certainty: the comparison of Anodyne being like Legend of Zelda is a terrible one. Andoyne’s combat system is extremely stripped down, there’s no interesting story or colorful characters. Probably the only comparison that works is the dungeon crawling/puzzles. Those at least feel very similar to each other, even if they don't feel particularly good in Anodyne. Do not go into Anodyne with the expectation that this is a Legend of Zelda clone. It’s not. Consider this, at best, an experimental 2D indie “horror” game with some inspirations from previous action/adventure titles of times gone by.\n\nAbysmal PC Support\nAndoyne’s PC support is abysmally bad. There’s only one resolution that the game is set to and it’s some smartphone portrait resolution. There’s no way to change it either, outside of making it run in stretched, windowed or fullscreen mode with scaling up to 5X. Controller support doesn’t work or is incredibly finicky to get running. I couldn’t get it to run and neither could quite a few people on the Steam community forums. That’s inexcusable considering the genre of game we’re talking about here. Keyrebinding is possible but it makes you set all of the keys at once so if you screw up a key, you have to do it all over again. The game’s menu isn’t mouse driven, so, have fun with that. The framerate is locked to 30FPS and it will quite often fall below 30FPS. No idea why. Oh and you can only have one save game at a time. Why? Who knows, I guess save games take up too much space. There’re a multitude of bugs and problems mentioned on PCGamingWiki[pcgamingwiki.com] that haven’t been fixed either. The poor PC support, the framerate problems and other issues are enough on their own to not recommend this game.\n\nGraphics are pixelated art pieces that use very reddish/dreary colors. While it gives Anodyne a distinct look, I found it to be overly samey and dreary to look at, so I don’t particularly like the style. Audio is a very moody and calm electronic soundtrack but I found it to be unmemorable at best. Overly repetitive at worst. There’s a single audio slider for the volume. The UI is….ok but the lack of mouse control can be confusing/annoying to deal with at times.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI don’t have the time or patience for this nonsense anymore. Anodyne is certainly a different twist on the usual RPG affair with its moody atmosphere and unusual visuals. But the gameplay is puddle-deep and extremely repetitive. Controls feel far too loose/unresponsive for how much precision the game sometimes demands. Additionally, don’t be fooled by the comparisons to Legend of Zelda either, Anodyne isn’t even in the same ballpark. The most that it picks up from Zelda is dungeon crawling/puzzle solving but even that’s fairly samey/dull to get through. The bosses are poorly designed, the combat is dull at best and there’s no story or interesting characters to speak of. The world itself is just a dreary place of misery and poorly written angst. None of this is fun to play or experience. Pass on this.\n\nRead this Review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]","August 22, 2015","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A great game to play during a slow weekend. I guess I should mention that I love exploration games, and prefer short atmospheric games, generally. If you're the same, then grab Anodyne.\n\nSeems like most negative reviews were expecting this game to deliver a perfect--or even better--Zelda-like experience. I would agree that the puzzles are simple, the combat is simple, and that there aren't diverse items, like in Zelda... but this game isn't Zelda.\n\nAnodyne focuses primarily on atmosphere and exploration. You must scour The Land for clues and passages to advance through twisted memories and Freudian nightmares of Young (heh... Jung). The music and artwork contribute to this aesthetic, and while its gameplay is simplistic, I would say it's well executed.\n\nThis is a short game. I finished the game with all achievements (not all "secrets" but all cards) except for the 100% three-hour run with an in-game time of just about six and a half hours.\n\nThe game introduces an interesting gameplay device at the very end which you can use to enter areas accessible only after you beat the game. I was disappointed that these areas didn't have bosses, or change the final boss fight. I stand by my positive review, though.","November 21, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its world is uniquely both off-the-wall and melancholic.  The atmosphere is what stands out most to me--the overworld is serene and mesmerizing to explore, the dungeons vary in tone, and the game in general has sort of paradigm shifts that caught me off-guard in a way I very much appreciated.  The gameplay is very reminiscent of Link's Awakening, while subverting many of its key elements, and virtually eliminating item management by having the puzzles revolve less around items and more around how Young's broom interacts with the environment.  As a result, the puzzles tend to be simpler and easier than those in Zelda dungeons, but they are also quite imaginative and manage to stay fresh.\n\nIf I had anything negative to say about this game, it's that the hitboxes are a bit too big, which gets frustrating on any screen with holes or big rolling spike columns.  I also think that while it isn't necessary, it would have been nice if there were indicators on the map of where things like unopened treasure chests and boss rooms are, and more guidance for where to find the post-game items.\n\nFor anyone looking for the gameplay of Zelda, combined with Metroid's attention to atmosphere, in a package that's more than the sum of its parts, Anodyne is a fine experience.","February 2","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as a kid named Young, who has to explore The Land in order to save The Briar from the Darkness... yeah, Anodyne's pretty tongue-in-cheek about its Chosen One schtick.\n\nYou spend the game exploring strange, eerie environments, fighting monsters, and solving puzzles. These range from a highway, to a classic Zelda-style temple, to an apartment complex, to an 8-bit maze full of zombies. The devs definitely didn't skimp on the environmental diversity.\n\nLike Yume Nikki, Anodyne's heavy on symbolism and light on explanations. (Why is the boss of the caves talking to you about video games? What's the deal with the Red Sea, and what are the things living in it?) The ending, as you'd expect, answers none of these questions and leaves the player even more confused. Maybe the postgame sheds some more light on things, but I doubt it.\n\nThere are a couple things I disliked, though. You can't get to the final dungeon unless you collect all 36 cards hidden around the world- there are markers telling you which area's you haven't cleared out, but it's still a pain going through the whole game trying to find the things you missed. The combat is pretty bleh- unlike Zelda, there aren't any special weapons, so bosses boil down to "dodge their attacks and hit them until they die", except the final boss, which is more of a puzzle than anything. There are some pretty brutal jumping puzzles toward the end of the game. And it's short: I beat it in about 5 hours.\n\nDespite these flaws, Anodyne is still worth checking out- I had fun with most of the puzzles, and enjoyed exploring all the weird locales (the game's oppressive ambient soundtrack helped). Play the demo on Newgrounds, and if you like what you see, pick up the full game.","December 29, 2015","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
