You make animal enclosures, pick the animals to go in there, hire vets, zoo keepers, gardeners, garbage men, place visitor facilities, plants, decorations and so on. As a game, its full of soothing music and the campaign tells you exactly what to do.\n\nThe game is good at telling you what the animals and visitors want when you click on them. Such as buffalo want to wallow in mud or have a mineral deficiency. Not just that, but icons hover over the heads of both animals and visitors. The visitors have smiles or frowns over their heads. The animals have icons indicating their needs such as its too hot out, if they're thirsty, hungry or need more foliage. The animals can do a variety of things such as mate, have babies, get sick, scratch on trees, play with toys and wallow in mud. Clicking on an animal shows their information in a panel at the bottom. This panel is full of information how their needs are being met. Everything from grass, meat, mineral and water to scratching, temperature, ground and foliage. To be honest the charts are appreciated, but not needed when the comment box for each animal bluntly tells you where each animal is deficient.\n\nYou don't just buy an animal or hire someone like you would a piece of furniture, you need to hire from applicants and buy from animal traders. Every animal and employee is unique unto themselves, so you need to select the right one for you. Not just that, but consider their price, age, health and skills. This all goes into the management aspect of it. You can sell off animals and babies. Its all about keeping your wildlife park running. When you click on an employee, you can see their range radius that they will tend to. The radius is a giant square that you can shrink or expand, but its always a square instead of just being assigned to a specific enclosure or two. The staff will attend to all feedings, watering, droppings and vets will attend to sick animals automatically. They'll also gain skills when working with animals too.\n\nWhen your visitor approval rating go up, so do your 'stars.' With more stars, you can charge more, upgrade buildings, unlock more buildings and have a selection of better animals. It is a wildlife park, not a zoo, even though someone in the tutorial calls it a zoo. Since it is a wildlife park, it sticks to that theme, you'll find wild animals here. You'll find bison, wildebeest, gazelles, lions, giraffes, hippos, penguins, cheetahs, bears, pumas, sea lions, leopards, chimps, gorillas, elephants, zebras and so on. Some might say the game is limited in its how many species of animals that it has. Perhaps some DLC will offer different animals, but since this game was originally released in 2011, I think that monkey escaped the zoo a long time ago.\n\nThe animals aren't the only things you'll need to keep alive. The trees are living too. They'll need the correct ground underneath of them to flourish. Not only for the animals to eat and shade themselves, but in this game, the animals get spooked from seeing jeep rides drive through their enclosures. So you'll need to obscure the jeep ride tracks with foliage as exampled in the campaign.\n\nI love games like these that blend management and creativity into making your own area. Games like Roller Coaster Tycoon, Zoo Tycoon, Prison Architect, Sim City and Cities XL. With that being said, I really want to like Wildlife Park 3, but it just feels so cumbersome, devoid of goals and just not fun overall. The 'campaign' is really just a tedious tutorial with some okay to good voice acting. This is one of those tycoon games that has characters commanding you. How to pick up animals, where to drop them. After about 3 hours, I felt like the tutorial wasn't specifically telling me what to do.\n\nThe tutorials seemed to have bugs or issues, such as the next button not working or even when you do what they tell you to, they still will not continue. Sometimes doing as you please and saying that area needs something, doing it then it breaks the tutorial and prevents it from continuing even after undoing what you did, causing multiple restarts when really I just want to build my own wildlife park. Perhaps none of their testers deviated and did anything the game wasn't instructing them to do. For completing each campaign mission, you'll unlock an extra decoration or something to add to whatever parks you have in the future.\n\nThere is freeplay mode, which seems to be the real game since the campaign is just a tutorial. With freeplay, you get to select a plot of land from dozens from around the world. You then select how much money you start with and rules such as if your animals and or plants can get diseases. The problem here is some of the areas just feel very small even for one animal enclosure, let alone dozens. Each plot of land has their own climate, either grassy, desert or tundra.\n\nWhile I can't say the graphics are the best, they're not the worst. You'll see stiffly animated animals and beautiful foliage, hiding in tall grass and experience all of the seasons with rain and snowfall. It is a nice layer of graphical detail. Even better than that, if you really want to examine things, you can use your mouse wheel to zoom straight up to the animals to see them play, swim, and eat or just to see how bored your staff looks.  You can also see how the characters don't move their lips when talking, but that's a nitpick unless you really want to figure out who is talking to you. When you are super zoomed in, you can see in first person perspective, and walk around. The only problem is right and left keys rotate you instead of strafing you, but when you're not zoomed in all the way, you can strafe. I guess it offers control diversity to what you prefer.\n\nThat is just the tip of the iceberg as to how the controls feel out of date. There are no hotkeys, you need to push the rotate button instead of mouse dragging to rotate like similar games a 3D engine. Its all so cumbersome. Luckily the 3rd tutorial teaches you to hold the mouse button and move up or down to rotate the item, otherwise you'd need to click the rotate button on the panel and check to see how far the item rotated. When I want to pick up an animal or employee, I need to highlight them, then click on move from a bottom menu, then move them and drop them. It just feels like an extra step and it could have been streamlined like other games have done.\n\nThe game is full of needlessly poor design choices. Yellow text on yellow and red gradient background so it blends in. Paths aren't considered ground so much as they are considered 'visitor facilities.' To top that off, paths are called 'ways,' in the menu, but even the game calls them paths and thoroughfares.\n\nThe game doesn't feel fun compared to most every other sort of build your own this or that tycoon game. There's nothing to do, no goals to achieve other than the blunt commands in the campaign tutorial. Visitors will have thoughts and I guess that tells you what you should do. They want to see other animals, so then you add more animals, and then they want to see more animals, so you add more animals. It would be nice if there was a campaign with goals such as have 600 visitors to your wildlife park within 2 years. Have X amount of animals in your park within 4 years. Have a park value of X amount in Y years.\n\nEven though this is a finished product, the third game in a series, it feels much more like the start of an unfinished game. I bought it in a $1 bundle and you can too. Maybe the fourth Wildlife Park will be better and have more to offer.","October 15, 2014","false","5.3"," 182 of 211 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","182","211","5","0"

Wildlife Park 3 is actually a pretty enjoyable Tycoon game. Whilst it's no Zoo Tycoon 2 beater, It definately holds its own in the Zoo Management genre, and is definately better than the recent Zoo Tycoon effort that was released on 360/Xbone which is a pretty poor Zoo Tycoon game considering the title its meant to live up to.\n\nBeing a fan of this genre though, I thoroughly enjoy this game thus far, whilst I'm not expecting any expansions or miracles etc, I think its a damn good attempt at the Zoo management effort. The variation on the animals is a pretty neat idea, For those that have Played Zoo Tycoon 2, they will know that having 8 Elephants that all look the same can look like a copy/paste effort. I find the overall experience exactly what you'd expect from a game like Wildlife Park 3.\n\nIf people can overlook the negative reviews about the game considering they all pertain to the error which has since been fixed and won't happen again, It's definately worth grabbing a copy to waste a few hours.","May 13, 2014","true","10.4"," 100 of 124 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","100","124","2","1"

The limited animal selection is boring, the campaignes are tedious, and the park leveling system is incredibly stressful.\n\nThe interface is also incredibly complicated and awkward to use. The music is monotonous and the voice acting incredibly tacky.\n\nIf you want a time decently fun time waster, I'd say you could go for this game. Definitely only get this game if it's on sale, though. I got it for around $3 and I'm glad I didn't spend any more.

DO NOT BOTHER. It's obvious the Devs gave up on this very quickly and didn't bother making any DLC.  Animal choice is quite limited, very very very few mods at all and its just glitch-fest 2016.\n\nIf you really want to play a zoo game i'd recommend the first WP for its easy but replayable game that has plenty of mods OR the more popular WP2 which in my opinion is the best out of all the WP's but for the love of god don't waste your money on this game because you'll either end up requesting a refund or wishing you had.","March 21","false","0.1"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

It has it's flaws like poor "decor" choices, silly animal models, boring people models, and the inablity to move bought buildings/plants/decor after placing them.  I enjoy raising the animals, running a "zoo" and zooming in on the animals to take screenshots.  The campaign is challenging at times and will give you rewards for your park.  There's a bunch of maps to make more parks on which is good for replay value.  You can also make multiple accounts ingame to play over and over or just reset the campaign levels.  In all honesty, at $10 for full price it's good, but if you can get it on sale it's even more worth the money!","March 24, 2015","true","31.7"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","1"

The campaign has voice acting which isn't the best but is done to a reasonable standard.\n\nI find the UI to be hard to see since a lot of the icons blend into the button but that could be my gamma settings. I highly recommend this game for fans of Sim games, like Zoo Tycoon and, of course, the older WildLife Parks games.\n\nPro\n\n* Large variety of animals\n* Good Graphics\n* Large assortment of enclosure items and customization\n* Voice acting of acceptable quality\n* High-quality sound effects and animal noises\n* Good amount of visitor attractions\n* Fun Campaign\n* Helpful tutorial\n\nCons\n* Hard to see UI ( might just be me however)\n* Could have better character textures\n* Small learning curve (for some but not many)","December 9, 2015","true","1.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joehtosis/recommended/287200/","joehtosis","Shit Burger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joehtosis/","242 products in account","After about a couple of hours of gameplay and completing the tutorial and several missions, I want to weigh in on what this game has to offer.\n\nOthers have covered some of these points already, but I'll summarize the biggest shortcoming as thus:\n\nThe overall aesthetic design of this game is atrocious.\nThe graphic design seen in the UI, main menu, even to the closing screen, are amateurish at best, I prefer the UI in Roller Coaster Tycoon 2, and that game is over a decade old. If you're prone to frustration, you will most likely give yourself a headache trying to figure out this clunky and dated interface. I still haven't figured out where (Or if) it tells you how much a purchase will cost before buying it.\n\nOn the bright side, the actual game itself can be beautiful at times. The screenshots are pretty true to the game.\n\nHowever, don't expect it to go much farther than that. The gameplay grows shallow after little play. Once you set up an initial enclosure, it's hard to care much more about it as there's little else to do besides make it prettier or bigger. Training of the animals is gone, there's so few of them that you run out of combinations of species to set up in one enclosure, and the only visitor attractions you can really build are safaris (Jeep and rail) and air tours.\n\nEverything else, as far as the small bugs go, pales in comparison to the sheer lack of gameplay that can be found in this.\n\nDon't get me wrong, what's actually done in this game is done fairly well, but the game is not worth the 10$ pricetag, not when you can pick up the 1st Zoo Tycoon ultimate edition for the same price at the time of writing.\n\nI bought it at 3.40$, and I feel like that was fair, I got what I paid for, but do not purchase this game fullprice, it's simply not worth it, and it pales in comparison to the previous Zoo Tycoons, and even the previous Wildlife Park 2, which is a complete shame, as this market is absolutely starved of games like this. There's only a handful of games which can liken themselves to the same genre, and what is there pales in comparison to what came before it.","September 30, 2014","false","2.8"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

There also seems to be a lmit on visitors allowed in the park at one time, people complaining that they won't enter the park as it's too busy... Also very annoying as the park looks empty. Once you get to end game (all animals) people don't seem interested in coming anymore, which suck on the second to last mission as you need to earn 100000, 3000 on facilities and 3000 on tickets...\n\nDespite this it's worth playing but gets boring at the end, maybe more choice of freeplay maps, more animals, decorations and facilities (or just start all-ready on the expansion packs).","August 9, 2014","true","160.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

There is a serious deficit of this particular Genre in this style format and they just happen to be the style of games I love best.\n\nThere were a few good notes.  The graphics were decent even on Medium setting. I liked the use of different emoticons to identify problem animals, guests and plants.  And I liked the way the ride designer would automatically navigate around obstacles making for relatively easy placement of the ride features.\n\nHowever, there are some issues with the level designs.  The boarders of the parks do not always permit you to build to the wall (which is the most affordable method when starting out).  The level challenges started off interesting with a semblance of story but the story fell off quickly and degraded into "Oh, I need a campaign task here..." with no consideration of the previous campaign nor returning to the players own park as part of the campaign.   Also The landscaping features are not adequately user friendly and it take allot of patience to get some special need animal enclosures to function correct.  A final criticism is with the "Workers".  The place and adjust area works good for the Gardner's and Keepers as it makes logical sense for the style of work they do, however, the Vets and Garbage-men seemed to be wasting allot of logical coverage ability for the style of work they would be performing.  All this combined with the limited items and animals made for some dry and fustrating game play which made the sandbox mode very...\n\n\nOver all it was an okay game...and I will continue to play it...but I wish I had NOT spent more than 5 bucks on it.","June 9, 2014","false","39.3"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","19","36","0","0"

Usually, when you play a sequel, it's a very similar game but with improvements. As an avid Zoo Tycoon player (I still own and play 1 and 2), I was looking for the next game to fall in love with along the same lines. In the 2nd Wildlife Park, I was annoyed at the staff buildings since they took up so much room and were never really a problem in my Tycoon games. They did fix that in Wildlife Park 3.\nMy complaints so far - I set the admission price, have animals in my park in a proper enclosure with their needs met and staff hired....and no guests are walking in the gate. Not one. The interface is awful and when you cursor over icons to try to decipher what they mean, they're not always very descriptive and it becomes a guessing game.\nThe graphics are.....schizophrenic. They're smoother, but all the animals and people look out of proportion. Some things look more cartoony than the 2nd Wildlife Park, of which I am disappoint. So they're not necessarily worse or better but kind of messed up in my humble opinion.\nThe freeform game is less freeform than the 2nd one. Instead of having access to all the critters as freeform usually does for a sandboxy sim, I have access to a small few. Kind of like ZT2 in Challenge or Campaign mode. I have a feeling I have to earn and unlock all the stuff. But then why call it freeform?\nOverall the game feels like it really doesn't know what it wants to do. If there were short-but-to-the-point tutorials like the ZT games, these games would be better as well. Going to try scenarios maybe and YouTube for tutorials or pointers but after that, I'll be completely out of love with this one.\nLiked the older Wildlife Park (with expansions) better and will probably put up with the crappy staff buildings and play it instead.","December 24, 2014","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
