Scroll to bottom for quick summary.\n\nYou start off with picking a character and a name (There are quite a few each, with unique looks). I do not know if there is anything more than looks to these characters as there are no descriptions. So I picked the one that looks cool, a dragon.\n\nFrom the main menu the GUI (user interface buttons) were quite huge taking up most the screen on my 46' 1920x1080 monitor. So I check the resolution and it was set to max. I then went to the graphic settings to see if I could scale down the GUI to make it smaller. There was no options, so I made sure the graphic options were maxed.\n\nGraphic Settings:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=370076665\n\nI then decided to start the game which gives you a couple different options. (Campaign, Single levels, Co-Op, Multiplayer) I started the Campaign, which gives you three realms to choose from. Once again, no descriptions on these three realms so I choose the one that had my favorite color. After selecting the Blue realm it went through some pages of story lines that you click next on which brings you to the campaign map.\n\nOne of the three realms campaign maps (Total 62 levels between three realms):\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=370073461\n\nOn there I decided to see what special abilities were by selecting it. Looks like tower upgrades but am not sure as I did not play long enough at the time of this review to unlock any.\n\nTower Upgrades:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=370068418\n\nOnce I entered the first level it was a little confusing trying to place my first tower. I shortly figured out that you can only place towers in the blue area's. Leaving, strategy placement pretty limited.\n\nTower Placement Locations:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=370077146\n\nBut you can double up towers in the same blue spots, making a huge clusterfk of towers in a spot if chosen.\n\nMultiple Towers in placement locations:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=370077346\n\nThrough trying to place towers I discovered another flawed aspect of the game, the controls. You can only use the keyboard to move around and rotate your screen. You can only zoom in and out with the mouse.\n\nKeyboard layout:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=370063926\n\nSummary\nSo between having a huge GUI blocking the screen, the controls not being user friendly, lack of details given about choices, not so great graphics, lack of tower placement for strategy, I CANNOT recommend this game at this time.\n\nUp close graphics:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=370076846","January 5, 2015","false","2.2"," 242 of 287 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","242","287","2","5"

Then you come to game like this where basically i played the first map and will probably delete it. Graphically its abysmal, not bad but abysmal, lacklustre colours and palette  and awful towers etc, basically the towers look like a small weed / few twigs. enemies are the same ,small pixelated faceless things. The landscape is really badly portrayed terrible textures etc.\n\nNow we get to one of the worst areas of gameplay - controls . when placing a tower you are shown green areas on the map where you may place your towers you are not instructed how many you can fit into a green area so its trial and error which doesnt bode well with 500 enemies heading towards you. Moving the screen to place towers is also cumbersome WASD is used for the usual function which Q & A to rotate the screen with the mouse being used to place/remove a tower , all this is done with a fantastic jerky motion. And should you move / rotate far enough you get to see outer space yes a beautiful black area where the edge of the map would be on a well produced game.\n\nI cant recommend this game in any capacity. If some poor unfortunate buys this and perseveres and it by some amazing chance gets better please let me know i would be willing to try again. As it stand i feel totally ripped off and wouldnt have been happy paying £0.99 for this game.","January 5, 2015","false","0.4"," 190 of 246 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","190","246","0","12"

Only for tower defense fans, and only if you can get it at a deep discount. It's very rough around the edges, and has an uninteresting boilerplate fantasy story. However, the tower defense gameplay itself is alright, and it seems to work reasonably well. Certainly, it's not the best TD game I've encountered, but I'm enjoying it enough that I want to keep going after getting a few levels under my belt.","January 6, 2015","true","26.3"," 42 of 58 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","42","58","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Darkshiv/recommended/333660/","Darkshiv","Dark || Shiv","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Darkshiv/","196 products in account","This review is of my opinion, I've only played TD games off of websites. This is my first one I've ever actually bought.\n\nIt's slow to get started due to odd difficulty settings. The difference between easy and medium are slim to none, but once you get the ball rolling you get the hang of it. It's fun in my opinion.\n\nTrue, you only start out with 1 turret (basic) and 1 spell (frost, slow effect) but you unlock a new turret every map you beat. You can also upgrade the placed turret up to 6 levels significantly increasing their power. You unlock more spells when you level up your 'avatar/profile' by gaining experience after beating levels.\n\nThere are 3 factions to choose from, which are pretty unique. One is an industrial-modern-ish style with guns and cannons. The second one is a nature style faction, druid like, using trees, poision and bees. (Also birds, the first turret with that faction literally shoots out a bird at the mobs.) The third faction is pretty much a Mage faction, Arcane towers shooting missiles of magic and exploding their enemies, using a variety of magic to reign down onto the mobs.\n\nThe game is very basic, and is obviously using a pretty dated engine. I like the feel of it. I'm not sure why, but I like the feel they unintentionally/or intentionally put on it. Brings me back when I was a kid and used to go to the used book stores and find a bunch of PC games that were never sold sent to them in bulk.\n\nThe Co-Op in this is pretty great in my opinion as well. You and your friend are able to choose different or same factions to set up defenses on the whole map. One friend could place turrets where the mobs may spawn and you could place turrets where the adds are trying to get too. My friend and I have been playing this a good amount the past couple days and have been having a blast trying to beat the levels. They get pretty crazy when you get to end level waves. You can also do this with up to 4 people! Which is really cool imo.\n\nPROS\n\n+ Variety, a lot of turrets for a single faction. Which there are 3 factions. No factions have the same turrets just reskinned.\n\n+ Maps, lots of maps\n\n+ Co-Op, up to 4 people\n\n+ Easy ability to control game speed (Also host can control game speed in Co-Op/Multiplayer)\n\n+ Fairly straight forward and simple\n\n+ Easy to run, probably my grandma's PC could run it\n\n+ Nice camera distance view, allows me to practically see the entire map to watch over everything\n\n+ Mobs don't follow 1 path every time you retry the same map\n\n+ For a seemingly old looking engine, I was suprised it supported my giant Samsung TV I use for my main screen. (1920 x 1080p) with no issues. Also with the ability to go into windowed mode.\n\nCONS\n\n- Hotkeys, no where to be found. Going to end up clicking everything. When ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan and you're frantically trying to upgrade all of your turrets to withstand the horde it sucks.\n\n- Difficulty, I feel like there should be no difficulty at all they Easy, Medium and Hard seem to be the exact same things.\n\n- Dead online, haven't found a single game on their multiplayer server browser yet\n\n- Turret placement, in this game you can only place turrets on certain spots on the map that are marked in a see through blue area on the ground. Some maps have very tiny ones that seem unfair and some maps have descently sized ones that seem fair and their clipping makes things difficult. It's hard to squeeze as many turrets as you can into one blue marked area. Some tiny turrets look like you should be able to squeeze 10 in, but in reality you can only squeeze in about 5.  Not entirely game breaking, but it's still frustrating sometimes. I've been able to still get through the levels.\n\n- No true Co-Op campaign unless you and your buddies are on the same faction. Now "Progress" in the game I would measure it to what turrets you have unlocked. Because the only way to unlock turrets is to play through your factions set of maps that you unlock in campaign. Due to that, which ever of the 3 factions you choose, they can only unlock their OWN turrets on their OWN campaign maps. So if your friend was faction A and you were faction B, and you both played his campaign map that unlocked his super turret and you beat it. You both would unlock it for only faction A and you would not unlock your faction B's super turret. It's kinda annoying, because it makes my friend and I alternate through each other's campaign maps.\n\n- No lobby for multiplayer. Everytime you get finished with a game, it doesn't put you in a lobby to go again with the same people and choose a different map. It forces you to go back to the main menu and create/join a brand new multiplayer game. It get's pretty annoying after a while.\n\nNot really a con, but I wish there was a sandbox mode in this, so I could just ♥♥♥♥ around a build what ever and see how long I could last.\n\nI'm sure I left some things out but over all and hopefully they'll fix add some things in patches eventually. I'd say it's a pretty fun game. 6.8/10","January 7, 2015","true","15.6"," 29 of 39 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","29","39","0","0"

I guess it´s a style thing, but my eyes would be happier without them.\n- Sometimes in some levels there are waves, that are out of balance and totally overpowered, especially the self healing mobs... you CAN defeat them, but hmmm, doesnt feel balanced well. Especially Dreoks Campaign after mission 13. So you have to take a specific tactic to prepare for meant wave (imbalance issue)\n- you can´t move the screen with the mouse (minor handling issue), you have to use WASD or the arrow buttons\n- on some ground textures you can´t see your own towers above them well enough... "where is it? i´m sure i´ve built it there, ah there it is..." (especially on lvl 1 when they are small)\n- Some sound effects like the first tower of the "nature race" makes an annoying sound, especially when there are many of them.  (The majority of tower sounds are good though)\n- the game has multiplayer, but due to the lack of players i could not test it yet (nobody on, but singleplayer is fun enough)","December 14, 2015","true","116.2"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

But unfortunately it falls into the "potential" category.\n\nThere is a great basis for one of the top games in this genre, but as yet, the game fails to deliver, chiefly because it suffers from a truly incompetent/archaic user interface and lousy "playability".\n\nThe game sets out to provide a gratifying user experience with the inclusion of multiple player profiles and campaigns and while this is so limited as yet (read meaningless so far), the player can drool over the possibilities that might offer in a genre (tower defence) that to date, has totally lacked this kind of wet dream.\n\nDevelop this aspect alone and the game designers have a winner.\n\nWhile im no expert, I can honestly say that as a lover of tower defence games, This one has the best potential so far, but the worst delivery.\n\nFix this, and the sky is the limit for this game. (I mean for God's sake people, get rid of the keyboard WSAD interface in favour of edge of screen mouse scroll at the very least!).\n\nAt the special price, its really great value, but at the recommended retail, its very ordinary so far.\n\nC'mon developers. lets see some commitment to improving it, and yes, I'd refresh it and even buy it again if you did,,... the possibilities are that good.\n\nI recommend it at the sale prrice ($4 or less), but would have no issue in paying full retail for this game if it was developed a little better.\n\n\n\n","January 10, 2015","true","53.5"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","21","32","0","0"

His stoic nature, and his patient aura followed him onto the battlefield, even as thousands upon thousands of arrows peirced his soft green hide.  He would even pause every few feet, just to look around at his surroundings (and seemingly into my soul) and then begin giving birth to 10-20 of his smaller clones, each of which also held his manly nature, though to a smaller degree.  Even casting ice on his path would not douse the fire in his heart, as he continued to wade slowly towards both legend, and a place in my dreams.\n\nPros:\n- Drat the Goblin lord, who lives eternal in the depths of this game\n- you do not have to put a password on your multiplayer games, due to small player-base\n- You can zoom in all the way.

That said, I'll go ahead and give my opinion on this one.\n\nPros:\n\n- 3D\n- Charming landscape (especially with the update)\n- Smart AI (If enemies keep getting killed going one way, they will try going the other way)\n- Special enemies like Mages, who will keep spawning lesser units untill they die, Ghosts, who heal damage over time, and Bombers, who will blow open roadblocks to create shortcuts and/or new spawn points for your enemies (this can be extremely frusterating at times)\n- 3 factions to choose from, all of which are completely different in the towers they can field (I like the gunpowder one best)\n- Towers can be upgraded 5 times which in addition to doing more damage, can also unlock new abilities like being able to shoot at 2 or more targets at once\n- Towers have different attacktypes such as normal, fast, strong, stun, slownown, poison, ect.\n- limited spaces to place your towers. Some people would put this down as a con, but I like it (although it too can be frusterating at times) because it adds more strategy to the game\n- Mana that builds up overtime as you kill enemies which can be used to cast different spells like increasing the amount of gold you get, increasing the amount of damage your towers do, or even freezing all your enemies for a few seconds!\n- Experience system thats lets you unlock/upgrade spells\n- Lots of stratagy\n- Lots of maps\n- Supports Multiplayer\n\nCons:\n\n- No multiplayer, unless you have friends to invite to a game, I have yet to see a game on the public server\n- Bug, if you use a gold spell to increase income and you already have a smaller gold bonus via a tower you built, the tower now produces the large bonus from now on even after the large bonus wears off (unless you upgrade the tower in question in which case it will again produce the smaller bonus.  However, once upgraded if the large bonus is again used, the same thing will happen).  However, this may have been fixed in the last update\n\n\nAll in all, I think it's a great game. If your already a tower defence fan, I say go for it.  If you havn't played a tower defence game before, but think they look cool, I'd say this just might be the game that gets you into the genre.  If you don't feel like paying $10 for it, just wait untill it goes on sale, or ask a friend who already has it to get you a copy "so we can play multiplayer"","February 6, 2015","true","67.3"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

Upgrades cost 2x more than the last one for example.\nTower cost-20 1st up -20 2nd up -40 3rd up -80 etc.\n**Tower build locations are fixed areas, this is purposeful to increase the strategic importance of where you dump your towers.\n**After a few levels there will be multiple paths the enemy can take and they will use their options, though there are always choke points or sometimes there is something they will target first before heading for the exit/exits. Example\nsome levels have a building or blockade on one or more of the lanes, once these go down it unlocks further routes.\n**After successfully finishing a level you will gain experience points increasing your profile level. As you level up you unlock more abilities which there are 10x of total. Every 5x levels you unlock a new ability.\nEvery profile level you go up you get 'coins' which can be spent on upgrading these abilities. 1x coin = 1x level of upgrade.\n**WASD control map movement, with all other actions living on your mouse. (I got used to this pretty quick personally)\nV controls game speed, normal, fast, faster (not sure exactly of time increase incremements.)\nmouse wheel controls zoom, from 1st person view of an enemy to a zoomed out view of the entire map.\nThere is currently no hotkey function, personally would love a upgrade hotkey, this is obviously something that can be added, I will update here if it is at a later date.\n**Support- From my personal experience the devs seem to be right behind their game and are listening to us gamers.\nI found a very minor unimportant bug that I emailed them yesterday, got a reply nearly immediately and a hotfix was released today for it.\n**There is currently no bestiary/tower glossary for enemies you have met and towers you have unlocked. I think this would be a nice feature to add personally.\n**There is a co-op/multiplayer feature, added new strategies and defense options. (I haven't found a level that co-op is a must yet)\n**Game can be challenging at times, it is not going to give you a hug, tell you everything is alright and offer a cookie. Though personally I am enjoying having a TD with this. It's a refreshing change.\n**The next approaching wave is denoted by a coloured orb, Red-Ground enemies, Blue-Air enemies, Yellow-Special\n**Graphics- This is not a AAA FPS game, it's a TD. Personally I prefer TD's to focus on strategy and defense, I can clearly see what enemies are approaching and have no issues identifying towers or placement locations. (Run at 1920x1080)\n**Seems to be pretty stable, haven't found any major glitches and have had zero crashes so far.\nHopefully this has been helpful, if you do buy the game, please watch the ingame tutorial, it is actually quite helpful though short.\nNow personally I recommend the game as I am enjoying it and would buy it again if I had a second choice. If it doesn't sound like you-pass on it or wait for possible new features.\nI will actually update this review if new features get released, eg-hotkeys.\n\n27/1/15- HOTKEYS have now been added to the game, list as below(Copied from patch notes)\nCustom key bindings integrated\nAdded key shortcut for updating towers\nAdded key shortcuts for zoom in and out\nAdded key shortcuts for Special Abilities\nAdded key shortcut for displaying construction places\nMulti-tower placements function added","January 12, 2015","true","8.8"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

If they were for fill in cut scenes, fix the clunky interface, add voice acting and some animations it might be worth $5.\nAt the current state, it just got boring real quick.

A lot of effort was made to display the past present and future of rpg gaming. if this would had released in the app store and was easy to run on a phone, this game would be in the top 5\n\nit took me awhile to understand the concept but once i did it was a basic tower defense with better graphics. its worlth about 12 dollars and i remember buying it for 3.74 so i got a good deal. its one of those games you would go to if you had nothing else to play or need a different genre.\nFirst Try:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz7beWJfE1o\n\nSecond Try:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYewhNVqr90","January 28, 2015","true","3.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I bought this on sale, as I was told it wasn't worth the full price, and I am happy I did, because I feel I wasted my money.\n\nThe game has a lot of problems. In order of how much they annoyed me (short summary at end):\n\n1. Language. It's obvious whoever(s) made this game wasn't a native english speaker. I can tell, because all of the writing in this game seems to have come from Google Translate. It's annoying, and difficult to interpret.\n\n2. The map interface. It has a habit of closing for no reason, and you have to click around to re-open it.\n\n3. Realms (teams/countries?). They have absolutely no description, no history, nothing. You just blindly pick one, and the only thing you're told is that a certain realm prefers magic, another nature, another machine. Nothing about the history or personality of the realms, and nothing about the pros and cons of choosing said realm. You essentially feel like there's no weight to the choice, outside of aesthetics.\n\n4. Stratagy. There's not a lot. Which is strange, since this is a tower defence game. When you play the game, you realize you can only place towers in small designated blue areas. Effectively, it's already decided exactly where you're going to put your towers, which limits the player a lot.\n\n5. The interface. First: It's huge. Second: It's ugly. Third: It's so large as to actually hinder the player, which is the opposite of what it's supposed to do.\n\n6. The graphics. Obviously, I was prepared for the graphics to not be the best. It's a tower defense game. This said, the graphics are not the best at all. They kind of reminded me of old Runescape graphics (from about 8-10 years ago, not whatever the current graphics are).\n\n7. Controls: You can't move the map with your mouse, but you can zoom. You can't zoom with your keyboard, but you can move. Not sure if this is intentional, but it feels like an over sight.\n\n8. Difficulty. This game is really easy, which is why I haven't played it much. You can just plop your towers in their predetermined locations and wait, not much intervention is required at all, which is disappointing.\n\nSummary: This game is frusterating to play, between the lack of strategy, frusterating interface, controls, lack of graphical appeal, and setting, this game is likely to disappoint people. I can't recommend it at all, as much as I wanted to like it because "3D Tower Defense!" it just doesn't live up to expectations.","February 18, 2015","false","0.5"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

I think it's a potentially good game with a lot of room for improvements. The graphics are okay, the controls take a little getting used to but nothing horrible.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Decent graphics\n+ Plain old tower defense without unnecessary bells and whistles\n+ Lots of levels\n+ Lots of towers to unlock\n\nCons:\n\n- No keyboard shortcuts for building, upgrading; none that I was aware of any way\n- Poor sound; the music is repetitive and some sound effect are terribly annoying, e.g. dying goblins\n- Not a lot of explanation about the interface, level system, abilities, etc.\n- Not very well balanced; too easy to get loads of money\n- Towers are not very intelligent; they will sometimes ignore a flying boss if a walking boss is also in range but behind\n\nAll in all, I think the game is not worth the full price (yet), however if you like tower defense games you will definitely enjoy it. The developers should focus on playability, clarity and strategic abilities. The latter mainly because the building spots are limited and the creeps will follow the least dangerous path and not just the shortest, which can be very frustrating because of its unpredictability. It's a nice twist, but the maps are sometimes not very suited for it.\n\nE.t.a.: I bought the game for € 3,74 in a sale which is a reasonable price for this game. The full price is not worth it and I wouldn't recommend it at that level.\n\nAlso, I deleted comments that attacked me in person. You can talk trash about my review or the game, I don't care, but stating that I am a person with low standards because I recommend this is unfair and has nothing to do with the game or the review.","January 5, 2015","true","11.7"," 39 of 88 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","39","88","0","7"

Which pretty much tells me, they never really even got to the game itself, as the GUI does have a bit of a learning curve.  However, with that said .. this is a pretty nice TD Game ... The Graphics are 3D Rendered ( though it feels like the engine used in some older games ).\n\nOne of the coolest features I discovered ( and I do mean discovered, as there really is not a help file - which is the negative ), is if you click on a monster which is crawling through your tower maze ... it locks onto him, and you can see the game from his perspective.\n\nThis does not deserve all the negative reviews.  It's a decent game ... especialy for the current price ( $3 + change ).\n\nIf you like TDs ... give it a try ( and give it at least 1 hour ).  You can't figure this one out in 30 minutes.

They've really made the game much more enjoyable!\n\nWierd ♥♥♥♥ about the game\n- The videotutorial must be the worst tutorial I've ever seen in a game so far, and I've been playing a ton of games.\n- The in-game music is so far off... Who chose this music to a TD-game??? It's NOT an adventure, it's a f*ck*ng kill and slaughter type of game... So why would you think I'd want to be hearing The Hobbit while I'm playing it??\n- One can only place towers within the blue marked places on the ground... This is very uncreative... the developer could've at least made like e.g walls to indicate where towers can be put and not...\n- It is still a questionmark over where the next wave will spawn. There is little information about this.\n\n+ You can press "V" two times to speed up the game x2 and x4! This is really REALLY nice! This also works while playing multiplayer-mode! Me and my friend played maps for hours yesterday and really enjoyed the game.\n+ It's nice that there are many upgrades per towers. By having so many upgrades available, you'll constantly need to choose wisely about what to upgrade first. While playing the waves, you'll have to keep focus, or else the enemies will get to the end. This is what is captivating with the game. It could also be a false in the game since you have no information about the wave coming up.\n\n+ I like that you level up the more you play. This gives you a challenge. After every level you lock up another tower and so on. So if you enjoy TD-games, you'll probably enjoy this game. Why? It's strategic, it's challenging and you'll constantly want to level up one more level.\n\nI'll give this a 5/10! Not too bad, not too good. He could've fix like e.g a house in all levels where one bought special items, pathchanges etc...\n\nNote...
