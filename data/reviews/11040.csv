I've liked the style since I first played Ripper and continue to enjoy every game that I get into from this series.\n\nNemesis finds Holmes pitted against Arsene Lupin, (a character of Maruice Leblanc's writings), the gentlemen thief.  While one could argue this way and that to the justice to the true character of Lupin, I think that misses the point.\n\nI found that the puzzles in this game are more enigmatic than those of the other games I have mentioned solely because Lupin is such a character.  I feel that the puzzles and tasks that lay before you as a player are cerebral and push you to observe everything.  In a sense, it is pushing you to be Holmes.  Though I may have groaned at another failed attempt at a puzzle, the sense of reward after finding the answer on my own was exceedingly gratifying.\n\nWhat Holmes game would you want to play that readily gives you all the answers?  I don't want one of those.  I'd rather sit and ponder art puzzles or move around a giant library to find the clues I need to complete each mission/task.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that is easy and entertaining to pass the time, this may not be the game for you.\nHowever, if you are looking for a game that's going to push you and test you, have great history, and by chance have you learn something in the process, then you should give it a go.\n","January 20, 2014","true","8.8"," 27 of 27 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","27","27","0","0"

The graohics are pretty much the usual for this series but they set the scene well. The audio is good as well, nothing out of the ordinary though. My two complaints about the game are too many MATH puzzles and there seemed to be too much retracing steps at every scene almost.  More than the usual. The map jump feature helps, but I actually thought I was going to lose my mind at the museum. Other than that I recommend the game as the story is good.

Different from "Sherlock vs Jack", "Crimes and Punishments"... There's no dead peoples, murders... It's only about this famous french theft: Arsène Lupin. However, I think that Lupin is an annoying "villain". Since he decides to mess with Sherlock, he became some sort of "The Riddler", making you (Sherlock) read paper after paper, make puzzle after puzzle just find an object to solve another puzzle.... to find another puzzle... to find another paper... to make another puzzle...(in the same scenario) to find another paper to know where it will be his next theft... zZz\nIn my opinion, he annoyed me so much.  And the ending wasn't so exciting...\nHowever, there were things in this games that caught my attention. The puzzles in this game are way more difficult than the puzzles on "Sherlock vs Jack" for example. And as there's no such thing as to find out who is the killer, there's no deduction menu, so they increased the number of puzzles (and Lupin's annoying letters).\nAnd don't get fooled by the "hints" on the menu. They are the most useless and laziest hints I've ever seen in a game xD Really.","October 11, 2015","true","10.7"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

This is the fourth game in the series. I want to get this out of the way and say, that this felt like a fan fiction version of Sherlock Holmes. This is a cat-and-mouse game of Sherlock Holmes versus Arséne Lupin, a gentleman thief written by a Frenchman Maurice Leblanc which was written while the Sherlock Holmes books were being written. Historically, these two characters are not strangers to each other with Leblanc writing books about their opposition. But was forced to change those names for copyright issues.  I have not read any of Leblanc's works so I do not know if Arséne Lupin is being presented correctly, but I am confident that Frogware have done their research.\n\nI had alot of frustration with this game. While playing I spent alot of time stuck in the British Museum part of the game. Walking back and furth between puzzles that Lupin set up felt like a time sink, and in the story it was, but also confusing when trying to figure out which part of the massive museum has what in which section. This game just felt very tongue-in-cheek about the entire thing. At some parts it was hysterical but removed me from the immersion.\n\nEven though I felt like I was being dragged through the mud by Lupin, knowing that regaurdless of what I did I would never hamper Lupin until the very end of the game. I did have fun with this game expecially near the end. If there were slight branching paths with solving the puzzles or figuring out conclusions, this versus would work very well.\n\nThere are parts in the game that made me smile. There were some clues left by Lupin which I, the player, had to take note which the game purposly avoids. They foreshadowed a later crime committed by Lupin, even further than the game wanted to offically mention. But I could not use this knowledge to make a trap for Lupin because of this limitation. There were also nods to the previous game, Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened, which I was happy to understand. And some of the other characters are fun to interact with expecially a lady in pink, I forget her name. I never experianced the Creepy Watson which this game is famous for, so who knows if you will experiance it too.\n\nIn summary: This game is good but not great. It is fun to deal with clues designed by a guy who want to get caught. But the middle part of the game is slow and bogged down by frustrating puzzles and being forced down a linear path until the VERY END. Get this game on a sale if you are unsure, it helps elevate any negative feelings. This game is still better than Sherlock Holmes and the Mystery of the Mummy. Even though I bash this game pretty hard, I still recommend it for those who want to complete the Frogware's game series.","October 10, 2014","true","9.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","1"

Watson is made to be an imbecile (as per usual in the Frogwares games), and Holmes goes on postulating and grandiloquising about five times more than he should do in his numerous speeches.\nVirtually every character that you meet is either eccentric or idiotic, the locations are *too* large when you are forced to find tiny clues and objects to further your progress, and the quiz that you occasionally have to answer fluctuates wildly between incredibly specific and unspecific answers.\nAs with the other games, you can't collect items unless there is a reason to do so, which can be especially infuriating in situations both where the environment is huge, and when Holmes randomly decides to just start picking things up, breaking the gameplay style that you have been forced to play by for the past hours.\n\nOn the plus side, while excessively large, the locations do look nice, and the first time that you hear the short endlessly looping soundtrack, it isn't unpleasant on the ears.\n\nUltimately, Nemesis isn't a bad game, just one of the dullest point-and-clicks that I have ever played.","May 18, 2015","false","8.2"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

This time they're threatened by the dangerous and subtle creativity of the Master thief himself: Arsene Lupin!\n\nAfter The dark atmospheres seen in the previous chapter it's an astonishing step forward to live this new adventure in the magnificent locations of London.\nA challenging letter from Lupin to Holmes anticipates the plan for his future thefts. Lupin's fame isn't underestimated so Holmes and Watson, together with Lestrade will work to chase Lupin in a 5 days long hunt.\nLupin will obviously Steal his targets day by day leaving every time clues in shapes of riddles. The idea is clearly brilliant, I loved the contrast of such an antagonist like Arsene Lupin, with a mastermind that can really rival Sherlock Holmes. I liked the riddles through the game but some sections end up being a bit repetitive, as some of Lupin's clues wil lead to other riddles that will lead to other riddles that will... Well, You got it, right? This will make you go back and forth a lot of times in the same locations. Somehow it didn't weight too much, though, but it might just be me.\nThe music takes again the classic mood, with some previous tunes and other classic melodies which will accompany your puzzle solving sessions.\nThough in the original game it was designed to be played in First Person View, in this remaster we can constantly switch between a classic interface and the original First Person View. Sometimes one will be more comfortable than the other, depending on the situaions. Anyways the interface and menus are quite intuitive and a little improved.\n\n\n+++PROs+++ ENVIRONMENTS. In this chapter we'll be visiting some of the main building in London and they are really built and decorated with great care, so the impact is very strong and pleasant. Really god job. Unfortunately I had the impression there were quite few locations.\nARSENE LUPIN. A perfect character to incarnate a great nemesis for Sherlock Holmes: clever, subtle, creative and still a gentleman.\nMUSIC. As usual pleasant tunes will accompany you in the game with some melodies used in the previous titles, new ones and classical pieces.---CONs--- REDUNDANCE. Some riddles will make you go back and forth all the time to move ahead and this scheme might prove to be too repetitive sometimes. Not to mention the re-used model for both the British Museum and The National Gallery directors, which was something quite unnecessary as they did a good job with other models so it wasn't much of an effort to make a new one, I guess.","April 6","true","8.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

This game is most well known in the series due to the Creepy Watson effect, in which Watson follows the player by constantly teleporting behind them due to lack of a walking animation, but what I didn't realize before was that this was actually tragically removed in a 2010 remastering of the game, putting an end to creepy Watson's legacy. It's still a very good adventure game, though, so I'd highly recommend picking it up. The puzzles in between each of the big events can get a bit tedious at times, mainly at the end, but if you can deal with the game showing its small budget every now and then it's well worth getting for fans of Sherlock Holmes.","March 31","true","19.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","5","6","4","0"

In fact, who the heck is Arsene Lupin? Isn't Moriarty usually Holmes' nemesis? Ah, well.\nThis game is different from all other Holmes games, in that you know who the culprit is, you just need to catch him.\nAs such, you pretty much spend your time playing his wretched 'game' of cat-and-mouse, where Lupin deliberately leaves clues to his next hit, and you have to follow along.\n\nLike "Holmes: Awakened", you get standard features like Holmes Vision and Teleportation, which are very handy in the game. But, unlike other games, this game involves a lot of mathematical work. AUUUGH. Maths.\nHow much Maths? Not a lot (i.e. counting, decrypting, mass conversions, etc.), but it gets rather repetitive and painful, especially in the library-museum part.\nAnd a lot of the time, you'll be following these cryptic rhymes to decode what the heck Lupin has installed for you.\n\nIn terms of characters, some of them are quirky, like the museum curator, and some of them a bit of a pain in backside, like Watson. Darn it, man! Why do you have to be hungry at a time of crisis?\nBut the Queen and Lupin part -- I don't think I'll ever get that out of my memory. Not that it was mesmerising, but it was -- "unorthodox", to say the least.\n\nInterfaces haven't changed a lot since "Holmes: Awakened". But you can certainly do a lot more things this time, with the amount of activity Lupin forces you you to complete. This means great variety in the puzzles in the game. But I still don't like the text-response puzzles.\n\nPlot-wise, not too heavy. I mean, you already know who the culprit is, so I guess this one's a more action-adventure than an actual story driven game. Good thing? Well, different.\n\nSo, I'll give this one a 8/10.

Well this is just as good as fries with pasta, you might enjoy both but mixed together are horrible. That is because the plot is really terrible : Arsene Lupin tries to steal British treasures in an effort to prove French are better. Never mind that Lupin in his canon is an anti-hero, i.e. a character that performs acts that are normally immoral (theft) but does so towards a good cause. Also, let's forget that the French and British empires had put their differences aside and in less than a decade after the timeline of this game, they would form an alliance (Entente). Even if you are willing to disregard these, I guarantee you that you will be disappointed by some of Lupin's escapes which seem more like out of a child's cartoon than the witty adventures of Arsene. And finally, the ending is the biggest let down of them all, with some "gentleman" non-sense going around, completely disregarding pretty much everything that has happened previously in the story.\n\nThe puzzles and object finding are tedious and not really interesting. A redeeming factor are some great settings and voice acting in locations such as the London Tower, the British Museum and the National Gallery.

The story of Holmes rising to the challenge of a criminal adversary is familiar to any fan, and this time it's the gentleman thief character Arsene Lupin. Lupin is a truly interesting character, which makes solving his thefts a fun task. The story does have its weak spots near the end ( The ridiculous thing with Queen Victoria, not to mention what happens when you actually catch him...) but they aren't enough to take away from the game's overall value. Personally, I think Nemesis is the best game of the series so far.\n\nGraphics and gameplay wise, Nemesis is nearly identical to Awakened. The hint system is much better though, which is helpful since the puzzles in Nemesis tend to be more math related. Though math puzzles may sound daunting, the puzzles are actually quite fun this time around, and the option to use hints eliminates any ragequit frustration.

Then you're asked to go back to look at a specifric painting again. I've never uninstalled a game so fast in my life.","December 8, 2015","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story of Holmes rising to the challenge of a criminal adversary is familiar to any fan, and this time it's the gentleman thief character Arsene Lupin. Lupin is a truly interesting character, which makes solving his thefts a fun task. The story does have its weak spots near the end ( The ridiculous thing with Queen Victoria, not to mention what happens when you actually catch him...) but they aren't enough to take away from the game's overall value. Personally, I think Nemesis is the best game of the series so far.\n\nGraphics and gameplay wise, Nemesis is nearly identical to Awakened. The hint system is much better though, which is helpful since the puzzles in Nemesis tend to be more math related. Though math puzzles may sound daunting, the puzzles are actually quite fun this time around, and the option to use hints eliminates any ragequit frustration. There is quite a bit of backtracking in the museum section, but you can use the fast travel system to get between areas quickly.\n\nAlso, Creepy Watson has been fixed, (un)fortunately.","May 17, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unlike many other Sherlock Holmes games (and that is also an unwelcome trend in crime novels in general), there was no detail revealed during the big monologue at the end that turned the whole story upside down. It all made sense with the information you already had from during the game.\n\nThe gameplay is enjoyable. With the interaction highlight and a very indepth built-in hint system, anyone can finish the story.\n\nThumbs up!","July 21, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was definetly worth the money. Overall, it's nice looking (bit aged though) and entertaining. Some funny scenes here and there. The puzzles are rather hard, and some of them probably unsolvable. But the built-in help function will get you over that (IF you figure out how to use that, lol).  From time to time, it is a bit too much running back and forth searching for and fetching items. And most of the time, you cannot get something if you don't now yet that you need it, meaning places you have already searched change their state and reveal that things can now be picked up because you watched a cutscene etc. and what seemed to be just part of the scenery can be picked up then. Anyway, overall, that is just a shortcoming, still enjoyable.","January 6","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Therefore I recommend this game to Sherlock fans, or Lupin fans, or even to hidden object game fans. Just get ready for running around back and forth all the time (thank god for map shortcuts) and solving way too many math puzzles. Those were very much not my favorite. This game is also lacking dead bodies, but at least you get to see pretty art everywhere. Worth it.","January 23","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
