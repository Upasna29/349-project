They were so difficult sometimes. If you wasn't skilled enough or didn't spend a lot of time to master the game, you couldn't finish it.\nIf you want to finish Kung Fu Strike even on easiest difficulty level, you need both: skill and time. And a gamepad too.\nIs it good? Definitely yes. Well polished, no bugs, good piece of software.\n\nVERDICT:\nIf you like beat ‘em-up games and don't afraid of high difficulty level, take it. You will have a lot of fun.\nIf you're not sure if you're hard-core or casual player, find out playing this game.\nIf you know, you're casual player, better play solitaire.\n\nLike this review?

This game is not for those who like having "the victory" given to them.\n\nHere's some quick gameplay notes:\n\nEach enemy has something unique that requires a different approach.\n\nLevels have unique setups enemy setups and conditions, so the game never feels stale.\n\nAnimations are well done. The staff wielding enemies are a prime example.\n\nAttacking an enemy is very satisfying because of the way they react to it.\n\nThere are various power ups, attacks, abilities, and items that can be unlocked. One ability that you should focus on getting is Air Guard.\n\nThe game supports local co-op (the entire campaign) via gamepad and KB. Both Xinput and Direct Input gamepads are supported (you'll have to configure Direct Input gamepads through the buggy config.exe. Xinput works by default). The game is difficult enough for you to "take turns" with 2 or more friends around.\n\nThe combat is not broken as some say and the game does not break its own rules; the only attacks that are unblockable are ones with exclamation marks, it does not depend on the enemy using chi attacks (I do not recall the game ever saying that chi attacks are unblockable) there can be a combination of chi attacks and unblockable attacks which are indicated by an exclamation point.\n\nYou have to use common sense when fighting some enemies. You can generally tell if an attack will cause you to stagger should you attempt to guard against it. Some enemies will try to land successive hits. Your first block requires less precision; subsequent blocks require greater precision. You can dodge/block mid-combo.\n\nThe game's graphics remind me of the newer Street Fighter games and another game called Power Stone 2 (I'd love to see that on Steam some day).\n\nAll in all the game is fun if you like a challenge, you'll have fun retrying over and over again by yourself or with a friend, if you know how to laugh at yourself.","August 18, 2014","true","40.2"," 34 of 41 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","34","41","0","0"

It's frustrating and fun, and the gameplay is very satisfying. Playing this reminded me of the videogames I played as a kid: You will die. A lot. You will continously try to beat the same boss for an hour and when you finally do, you'll cheer. Some of the enemies fight extremely dirty, and there will come a point where you will all but have to look up combos and strategies to advance, but it's worth it.

It has a fabulous fighting with pleasant graphics and animation, spectacular attacks, as in the Japanese-Chinese movies. An interesting and enjoyable combat system with lighting fast moves and super abilities which can be triggered by gaining enough rage. There are a crazy numbers of combos you can pull off which is always fun to see, and the nature of the game play makes it easy for anyone to pick up and play. However, there's a certain level of patience and stubbornness involved to beat the game. If you're one of those hardcore players that see games not as entertainment but rather as a challenge and a test of character, then this simple fighting game will abuse you just the way you like it. You may have a struggle in the later levels of the game, but co-op will make that easier for you. This is a challenging, yet simplistic and adrenaline fueling game, something to keep you entertained for hours.","May 1, 2015","true","7.1"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maghook/recommended/212030/","maghook","Maghook","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maghook/","1308 products in account","Kung Fu Strike is a needlessly difficult game in which the rules are defined and immediately broken. The combat system is initially exciting but soon becomes tired and clumsy when met with a particular group of enemies or a very unrelenting boss battle. You can not lock onto enemies, instead the game will automatically choose who you're fighting at any given time. There will be times when the game will wait for you to initiate an attack only to have your character unintentionally go soaring over the head of your opponent.\n\nThe arenas in which you brawl are often claustrophobic and allow little room for error. The size of the stage will at times be so small and swarmed with such a large amount of enemies that you will lose focus of your character and not be able to clearly see who you should attack and when you should counter.\n\nSpeaking of, the counter system is confusing. In the beginning you are told to counter against enemies by following their attack animation and that enemies who suddenly glow red can not be countered. In a later level you will face an opponent who can be countered when glowing red, destroying whatever rules the game had just set. You can not counter low attacks, even when the enemy isn't glowing red. Sometimes countering an attack will not break an opponent's combo as they continue landing attacks, even though it's possible for them to break your combo. If you immediately begin to counter an enemy whose attack animation has just begun your counter animation will sometimes end before they land their attack, often causing you to take significant damage if caught in a combo. Sometimes you may be swarmed with enemies who will all attack at once or immediately one after the other, forcing you to forever counter their attacks or risk taking damage as you focus on a small group of enemies whilst the other group pummels away at you.\n\nThe character is always at a disadvantage. You are required to fight, earn money, and then purchase unlockable items in order to stand a chance in future fights. Unfortunately you never really know which items are most appropriate until after you've failed the next battle, there is a lot of trial-and-error involved here and that form of repetitious mechanic isn't very appealing.","May 1, 2014","false","7.7"," 86 of 140 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","86","140","0","2"

Read below about it!\n\nIMPORTANT: negative reviews which are based on complains regarding the special moves.\nSaw that people complaining how bosses ignores your block, they break your moves and whatever.\n\nTHIS IS NOT TRUE\n\nYou are free to block, break, dodge any move, even special ones, bosses does that too.\nFor example swordsman, the 4th level, I didn't have anything unlocked, managed to get A rank on normal for 54 seconds with combos up above 100, how?\n\nFirst to mention, there is no such thing as special or attack which cannot be blocked, dodged.\n\nSwordsman low hit special.\nHe makes low hit, low hit cannot be blocked, then you either evade with L or jump with K then hit with J and again with K to break his block. Then hold J to make combo, then JK and you get him stunned most of the times.\nIt is very important to press it on the right time, don't wait the hits to appear, they disappear quickly.\n\nSwordsman spin attack.\nHow to dodge the spin attack, evade forward with L you will roll underneath him. Or press space to block and then L to evade, succeeds all the time.\nIn short you use block and evade at the same time because spin attack makes several hits.\n\nThe level with several bosses and normal enemies 3rd one.\nThere you start with 3 special enemies which causes quakes when they hit the ground, you have chi potion in the middle, you run around them, then you evade with L and right after that activate special hit with J and K thats how you break them.\nAnother hint, normal enemies attack the bosses if boss hit them or bosses attacks them if they hit him.\nSo your strategy is to evade as much as possible and wait till they get together to use special on them.\n\nThe game is just really hard, I mean really hard because i just started playing it, I've played another fighting games and haven't seen one that requires so much time to make a tactic how to beat it.\n\nSo, in case someone tells you that bosses play unfair and they break your moves and attacks in impossible way, thats not true, you can do the same thing with their attacks, just you should find a way how because every enemy is unique in style and requires time to study the moves.\n\nABOUT THE GAME\n\nIt has nice graphics, sound is nice, music doesn't bother, comic story panels on missions makes it look cool, reminds me of Street Fighter as graphic style actually.\nAs for missions, every single one is different and requires different strategy, you may be the best on some level, still got smashed in another one for seconds.\nOn the other side movements are very good, attacks and blocks are dynamic, theres no delay, everything is executed right away and you must know how to play piano to deal with it. As fighting style reminds me of Killer Instinct 2 to be honest about.\nYou have 4 button system, block, evade, jump, attack, with plenty of combination to make a nice combo in any situation, specials are not that important, they are needed if you want to knock off the enemy for awhile.\nIn the game you have things to unlock, you earn money and you can unlock additional skills or buy items, which is pretty cool too.\nSeems like in this game everything that matters is skills to block, evade and counter attack then combo.\n\nMultiplayer, coop, vs, haven't tried those!\n\nIt is not the best fighting game for sure, it is not the typical fighting game too, certainly not a game for you if you just want to beat someone.\nIt has non-standard gameplay, it is made to be a challenge, so if you like to get beaten a lot till you figure out how to pass the level, then you can get it and try it out.","October 16, 2014","true","11.7"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/212030/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Kung Fu Stike was a very unexpected blast to play. But be warned it is a very difficult game that wants you to lose. I would not suggest it to gamers that get easily frustrated. So you may be wondering what is this game about? Well it is a weird mix of a beat'em up and a fighting game with a rather cool option to call in reinforcements if you don't mind paying some much needed gold. The story is well....I have no idea what is going on to be honest, but you can safely ignore it without missing much of anything due to its paper thin plot.\n\nThe visuals are pretty nice and remind me of Street Fighter 4. The music is nothing memorable but it gets the job done. Pretty much everything is just average in Kung Fu Strike, but where it really shines is in its fast paced, combo centered gameplay. Controls feel nice and responsive, be it in a 3d brawler areana or a 2d boss section. And I love how the crowds of enemies don't just sit around and wait for you to punch them like in the Batman or Dynasty Warriors games. They will attack you from all sides at once rapidly draining your health unless you block or dodge out of the way. This is not a game where you are a overpowered god like character, you are simply a General trying to put down a rebellion and may occasionally need to rely on the help of your comrades if you are not skilled enough at the game.\n\nStill your character is no push over. Deal or take enough damage and you could pull off some special moves that deal serious damage and have a generous area of effect arc to take out the lowly grunts or just get some breathing room when a boss is in the middle of a combo. You can also equip up to three items, from a herb that brings you back from the dead to taking less damage from explosives and thrown weapons. You regain life by picking up rice balls that fly out of a defeated enemy and they may also drop a item that you need to be able to call in for backup.\n\nThe game is not perfect though. By far the biggest problem I have with it is that the camera is just bad. Too the point of costing you more than a couple of fights due to it freaking out and spinning all over the place or some object being in front of the camera blocking your view. Another problem is that you cant change the resolution in the option menu but have to go into the game files and set it through a "Config" file. And the last problem worth noting is that alot of the time you require alot of luck. What I mean by that is you can sometimes go a match with the enemies dropping nothing but coins and no other useful items. Makes it quite frustrating when this game is very stingy with its checkpoint system and the overall difficulty.\n\nOverall I would suggest you try the demo before you buy to get a feel for what this title offers. If you enjoy it and dont mind knowing it will get very difficult later on, it will have you addicted and wanting yet another go at that seemingly impossible boss fight. The sweet taste of victory when you finally bring down his health and dive quick him 20 feet through the air is more than enough to warrant the full price of $10 :p","February 19, 2014","true","3.6"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","20","29","0","0"

I was expecting some fun, but maybe generic 3d beat-em-up game. What I got instead was more on terms with the "character action" genre, like a low budget indie version of something made by Platinum Games, the creators of Bayonetta.\n\nThe game seems like it's accessible to all kinds of players, easy mode is for people who just want a fun mashable time, normal is for normal people, and hard mode is on Devil May Cry 3 levels of skill requirement, meant for the player that enjoys losing constantly until something "clicks" and they can parry every attack and do amazing stylish things.\n\nIf anyone has played "Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks" I would say that is a good comparision to what this is, except this has much deeper gameplay systems and it requires you to think on a higher level above just hitting buttons. You must have quick reactions and you must use your moves strategically until you open an enemy's defense and you go for the big combos.\n\nWhen there is a 1v1 duel with a boss, it really does feel like some epic kung-fu battle, where both combatants are using all their moves in their arsenal to counter and destroy you, especially on hard mode, the enemies don't mess around. The excellent speed and animations really bring that out beyond most other indie action games. I really get a "Fist of the North Star" vibe to everything as well.\n\nThis game is dirt cheap on sale right now and beyond every other cheap indie game right now I would say get this first if you are even a slight fan of action games.","December 23, 2014","true","1.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","0"

Or, as your enemy turns red to use a strong attack, you can counter-attack with one of your abilties to deal massive damage with a cool sound effect along with that.\n-Very fast paced game\n-Very good progression system: You must pay to increase your health and your gauge, you must unlock new abilities and combos, you must find new allies to use as decoys to complete your objectives.\n-The AI is impressive. They all attack you at once, often and fast, but because the defense system is perfect, that's not really a problem.

That will mess you up. Other times, the camera will be set in an angle that will completely foreshadow your character so you cannot see since the objects that covers your character completely will not become transparent like in most games.\n-There's a very hard part in the game where your character become poisoned for a couple of stages. It's doable, but frustrating. You will need to perfectly plan your strategy to complete these few stages.\n-Very luck based game on drop rates. Sometime, enemies and the objects you break will drop food for health, other time, they don't at all and the lack of food can be the reason you lose.\n-Decoy cost money and you need money to unlock new move sets. Because of that, if you keep on losing, you eventually end up losing more money if you keep using decoys.\n-The last boss of the game with no DLC is way way way too hard on normal or hard mode.\n-At the end, you have to grind to unlock everything to stand a chance agaisnt the last boss(That is optional, but recommanded).\n","February 28, 2015","true","9.2"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","16","23","2","4"

Combat is stiff and restrictive and you will quickly tire of enemies spamming unblockable and nearly undodgable attacks at you.

The fighting is fun, chi attacks are awesome and when you do a chi attack while enemy is prepairing for one is GOD DAMN SATISFYING.\n\nBut(you can't evade the buts), there are some annoying things too. First of all the camera. You may not know how many times I died because of the camera shift while I'm whaling on someone or coupe of dudes running at me or when I'm about to deliver a sick chi attack! Other than camera shift while in combat there is this weird deal of the camera getting behind things and not being able to see the damn fight. And sometimes some short enemies stand right behind the character in the way I won't be able to see them and get killed by them.\n\nIf you can handle these issues than no problem, but again If you want to have more insight let me try to control my rant mode and try to point the other issues that are probably not a problem for everyone.\n\nSo there are some stages with a lot of enemies, A LOT, when in this kind of stiation and when you don't have anything to distract them like some allies or some diffirent type enemies or weird deal of attacking each other, the fluency flies of from your side and goes to the computer controlled dudes side. They whale on you! They do it like that is what they are programmed for (Probably that's why)! But damn they don't take a break, even the littlest of enemies do chi attacks and when you fall say bye bye to all of your trap cards ...(wait that's from somewhere else) you won't be able to get up probably. But If you have luck you might just be fine or If you are  someone that's made out of reflexes.\n\nWhen you are able to finish the game in the normal mode. You would probably want to do it again in hard mode right? Right indeed! But in this case game gets really hard. But that's want you wanted right? Game to be more challenging 'cause you handed It's ♥♥♥ when It was on normal. Well than, have a fun time swearing all over the place and to everything that exsits in the real world or anywhere else. Because damn I've been paying a lot without break and ... the anger I have is huge (♥♥♥♥ joke?). But that is probably my problem some anger issues for sure. When you are fighting and when there are really small time for you to react to every attacker, It gets on you. You won't be able to block 5 dudes continues attacks, you won't be able to block some weird ♥♥♥ attacks of some enemies. And projectiles? Don't get me started about the DAMN PROJECTILES!  There some level with huge amount of projectile throwing on you and with some sword fighters. That is ,excuse my manners, F*CKING BULLSCHL*NG! Do you know why? Because If you are to try deflecting the non-stop projectile coming at you sword fighters will get you, If you are gonna fight with sword fighters well you know what will happen. And If one of the sword fighters is a type of boss, good luck saving your ♥♥♥ before It gets rendered like the cheese in a pizza or If you like on a dish of macaroni.\n\nOther than angering deals, It does not have cut scenes other than comic book style story telling. And It kind of lacks the feeling of moving from places to places. I mean when I come to somewhere It's like I teleported there like the damn Doctor Who. And story is a bit not-there type. I mean yeah It is there, game tells you about It but It is more like a ghost that you hear all about but never be able to see with your own damn eyes.\n\nIn the end, this game is fun to play. Works almost flawlessly.And I hope I can play with my friends someday.","October 27, 2015","true","17.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

This game is great, I mean just playing the game and beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of numerous enemies feels pretty damn good, and even though they for the most part overwhelm you they can easily be dispatched by numerous chi moves and combos. Unlocking moves, replaying missions just to get the coin for said moves also is cool and even though i really do not like grinding in some games, this game does it right somehow. It's also good to note that this game is 2 players and I haven't tried it out yet but from what i've heard it's more fun than playing in single player, which is to be expected. The game is also optimized incredibly well, which is good considering the extremely limited amount of video settings they give you. The only two problems I've had concerning this game however is getting it to launch, for some reason my game whenever i press the start button will not launch although the process is still going on in task manager so that's something to keep in mind whenever buying this game, the other problem is the camera angles in the game, i've had numerous occasions where i'd be fighting a boss and the camera cuts behind a rock, limiting my view. Anyways, i'd give this game a buy if you just want to see how you'd like it, stay cool folks!","August 23, 2015","true","5.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

In the time I have played it, had I known of it's excistance, I would gladly have bought it regardless of the sale. Generic Title Brawler or Kung Fu Strike, is a beat em' up game and a rather fun one at that. In regards to story, I honestly couldn't say. I thouroghly enjoy cutscenes and delving in the lore and what not, but I had a wierd compulsion to skip all the still image cutscenes, maybe cause I play this particular game for one reason.\n\nGameplay has you, in each level, fight in arena against a number of enemies of various strengths with a challenging boss at the end, however some levels do the cheap alternative of just putting a previous boss and their twin sibling/clone to pummel you silly. In regards to combat you have your light, heavy, jump attacks, counter, and dodge. You'll have fun pulling off flashy combos and contrary to nay-sayers, the fighting does not have a broken/ginormous learning curve. It took me awhile to realize in order to perform different, stronger moves, and proper counters, they must be executed with timing. You will only get so far mashing the attack button and your Common Martial Arts Striker will keep raving while you get attacked if you keep mashing the counter button.\n\nThere's also a local co op, I haven't tried it yet (no one wants to play with me :D) but I'd like to speculate that it is just a buddy who can jump in to help you on the harder levels and harder some of these levels can be, I mean, there totally possible to beat flawlessy with concentration but the level with raining bombs? Fork that level. Overall, though, a decent brawler to pick up and play.","November 3, 2014","true","7.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

I enjoyed the beat 'em ups of the S/NES days, and a handful of strictly fighter titles since then from franchises such as MK, Soul Caliber, Killer Instinct, Tekken, and of course the Smash series.\n\nThis game is flashy, pretty in a kind of nostalgic way, frustrating, and even rage inducing.  I've yelled out in defiance at an uncaring Game Over screen, and keyboard mashed ALL the buttons after dying for the 50th time after failing to counter "when I was so obviously countering and blocking I'M PUSHING THE BUTTON WTFFF" for at least the 900th time.\n\nI am still going to play this game because after putting it down for a bit and reflecting on the experience I just had, it was a lot of fun.  I felt immensely satisfied planning out a combo starting off with a successful counter or block and obliterating a huge chunk of an enemy's health bar.  The small measure of pride I gained upon working out a boss's pattern made up for the minutes of grief and frustration it took to do so, though it felt like hours.  The hours that I played though felt like I was only playing for half an hour.  Time passed oddly when I play this game.\n\nI'll need to take frequent breaks to calm down and come at it again with a clear head, but I do not regret picking Kung Fu Strike - The Warrior's Rise up.","October 6, 2014","true","2.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You've probably never even heard of Kung Fu Strike. So... welcome, join the club ! If you want a cool, cel shaded sort of beat 'em up, this might just be the thing for you. It surprised me, in a positive way. Having never heard of the game it's usually difficult to judge if a certain game might be in your alley. Kung Fu Strike could be.\n\nKFS manages to give us smooth controls (very important for a beat 'em up), sharp visuals, ok sounds (nothing extraordinary) and solid gameplay.\n\nThe story isn't all that great, but the battles are. Most of the times. Each level consists of 4 smaller levels with the fourth one having a boss battle. These boss battles can be pretty hard if you just mash the buttons so in order to win you'll have to create combos, deflect attacks and use chi energy, in a tactical way. Trust me, it's not as easy as it sounds. But hey, I like a challenge so I'll just keep trying I guess.\n\nAnyway, you might actually want to put this little game on your radar people.\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","July 29, 2012","true","2.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","2"

I did not go into this expecting much, and the mechanics, animations, and sound design are really good and solid (with minor exceptions). However, there were frequent times I found myself wrestling with a spazzy, undecisive camera that would swing around wildly or get obstructed by foreground objects. Most enemies have very boring ways of defending themselves that come with bright button prompts telling you how to break their guard, and many large enemies have attacks that are unblockable and very troublesome to evade (although the parry and super-counter systems are well-implemented and very satisfying).\n\nI would have still given this a pass, but what broke me was a level where you must fight off stone soldiers while bombs are being dropped regularly into an arena. This would be fine except that the smaller bombs always drop next to you and always explode before you have time to react. It legitimately shocks me that this level went through concept, design, builds, testing, and at any point, somebody -anybody- said "Yes. This level is a good idea to have in our game."\n\nThe game is surprisingly high-quality otherwise, and if these issues don't dissuade you, feel free to spend your money. But folks, if you need a great new beat-em-up, just go buy Aces Wild or Double Dragon Neon.","February 25, 2014","false","2.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

BUT, the difficulty is too hard, even at the easiest level (also suffers from bad camera angles), to be accessible to someone just looking to pick it up and have a bit of over the top kung fu fun!\n\nDo you like grueling levels that will stomp your a** into the ground? Well even if you do you won't like this game. The novelty of being a bad a** kung fu master wares off after you start to get into the later levels and consistently get beat to a pulp by mobs of enemies.  I love a challenge but this game does it all wrong. Low attacks that are unblockable, having special attacks interrupted when you're hit from behind and soul crushingly bad camera angles when dodging that seem to come at the worst time. Even on the easiest level you will find yourself getting abused, but it's not in the same vain as Dark Souls where you feel the urge to come back for more and over come by thinking of a new strategy. I just found myself not really having fun and even over coming tough bosses didn't feel that satisfying, but more like a waste of time. They could of implemented some strategy to it but when you're being over run by swarms of enemies and they can hit you  with unblockable moves in the middle of your move it leaves little room for enjoying your move sets and what could of been a fairly fun counter system. The juice isn't worth the squeeze on this one. You're better off investing your precious time into a game where the challenge matches the reward.\n\nPROS:\n\nOld school kung fu style\ncool looking moves\nlocal co-op\n\nCONS:\n\nreally bad camera angles\nunnecessarily difficult\nno online co-op\n\n","May 27, 2014","false","4.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

I think I played and finished most of the old arcade Beat 'em Ups and also I play OKish on Street Fighters.\n\nKung Fu Strike rewards persistence, since it forces you to learn and re-learn how to play on every level. And every new one will increase the difficulty a lot. But on your 11th try, you manage to adapt and find the weakness of your enemy/enemies.\n\nThe whole interface is very professional, and of course that the gameplay is very, very finely tuned. Parrying feels just awesome, like it was on Street Fighter 3. You will need to use an Gamepad.\n\nNot only that, I also had one of the most intense experiences in a game lately on the final boss: she was with about 1-2% of health and I ran out of criticals, so I had to be very, very patient and wait for that small weak moment while she also regenerated health. In the end I won (it was like my 20th try) and felt great.\n\nOf course, this game isn't perfect, since the camera alone can instakill you if you're not careful, and some tutorials are wrong. Also, if any game labels the gameplay as "Easy" it should really be easy and not feel frustrating. Though I'm glad it did.\nBut those are just details, in all, the gameplay and controls are almost perfect.\n\nI managed to finish the whole game in 3 sittings, so the game isn't impossible. But you need to be good at this kind of games, else you will die every time.","May 6, 2014","true","12.1"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

Music is OK. Seems to not have technical glitch.\nCON: Need for repetitive trial and error, plus some luck.\n1. Enemies and/or level design often have "special trait" that requires a "correct" method to fight. The problem is that making "wrong" move usually result player getting killed rather quickly.\n2. More significantly, even with right strategy in mind, the number and mix of enemies rushing the player in a given level tend to result in multiple attack types (blockable+unblockable, ranged+melee...) happening simultaneously or near-simultaneously. The need for precise blocking / dodging timing often means that at least some of the attacks get through. This also tend to end fights quickly, necessitating level restart.\n\nIMHO #2 (quantity instead of quality of enemies) is by far the greatest source of difficulty. This gives me the impression that the game was designed and tested for local co-op. Even in single player mode, when backup AI characters are available fights get noticeably better.","June 15, 2015","false","13.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Algae/recommended/212030/","Algae","AL_TheHoly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Algae/","300 products in account","SUMMARY\nThe combat is far more in-depth than one once assumed, the game cheats to ensure you remain challenged, and the game always has a new mechanic/trick/challenge up its sleeve that keeps fighting interesting. Lightly strategic, and amazingly visceral combat to boot. As of this writing on 10/3/14, it's $0.99, how could it hurt to buy this?\n\nSTORY TIME\nWell, what an unusual situation I am in with this game: I had the 'misfortune' to play the demo on another platform (probably the 360) a long time ago, and the demo only included the first 2 acts in stage 1. I played it, deemed it a mashy beat em up with no depth, and disregarded it entirely. Come 4 or so days ago, I notice it on sale for $0.99. I decided to buy it, not entirely remembering what it was that i disliked about it.\n\nI finish the first 3 acts of stage 1, and felt the same way. Then I played the 4th act, The Swordsman. Suddenly, the game wears its true colors, and mashes me into a fine paste. Of course I get mad, decide the game was cheating, as it was indeed breaking a lot of rules it had already established. After a dozen or so tries, I win, and that should have been the end of it. But I keep playing either way.\n\nAct 2 is already off to a good start, wailing on me mercilessly, but despite the game going out of the way to break rules, it slowly dawns on me that it probably wouldn't stand a chance if it didn't. An hour of arduous play later, I beat the 2nd Stage. Now I'm hooked.\n\nVERDICT\nThis game is really really FUN. The demo I played so long ago did an excellent job of selling itself short. The light content the game gave me convinced me the combat was overly simplistic; not the case. The BASIC COMBOS are very unique, in that both directional inputs, timing, and the speed at which they are pressed changes your attacks. This allows for a very fluid, natural feeling attack sequence that is wildly variable based on user input, as well as highly adaptable to the enemy. The sounds they chose for some of these strikes are so viscerally satisfying, you're likely to react quite strongly at the earth shattering, bone crunching, lighting-esque chi strikes you'll be landing on the enemy.\n\nThe COUNTERS/GUARD BREAKS are a neat mechanic too, it's a little cumbersome at first, because the Hold X commands are not easily understood at first, but how it works, is if the enemy is trying to do light parries, the hold X command is a rapid flurry that aims to overwhelm them and break their guard. At any time, if they can't, or wont, let their guard break, they'll go into a full guard, the jumping attack (A), is used to break their guard in this case. Depending on the enemy, you can get anywhere from a few hits to a full blown series on them. This system, I realize, is meant to punish mashing. Yes, I said it, mashing is bad in this game. Mashing some situations is damn fun, but the game demands carefully chosen attacks. A layer of, dare i say, STRATEGY. That or PATIENCE.\n\nThe enemy can use your PARRY and CHI STRIKES as well. The white glow is their parry, and the red glow is the wind up of their strongest attacks. You can bait their parries with carefully placed strikes, and CRUSH their powerful attacks with your own, giving huge damage, stunning everyone in the fight, and giving that oh so wonderful thunderous crashing sound that I crave so very very much.\n\nWhat surprises me is this game, despite pulling so many stops on me already, still finds ways to make each new fight even more interesting than the last, new enemies, new challenges, new mechanics to learn. On top of that, every act is a small, self contained fight that is short, but exciting to play, and easy to jump into and attempt.\n\nISSUES\nI daresay my BIGGEST QUALMS with this game so far are the lack of integrated settings (you have to go outside of the game to adjust your video settings), the lack of the ability to remove the letterbox that forces 16:9 ratios, even on 4:3 ratios, the lack of a quick restart option in the pause menu (Really frustrating Stage 2 boss, I'm looking at you), having to sit and wait for your body to settle before you can continue (2nd stage boss again), and unusually high costs of items. I suppose the latter most is resolved by playing on all difficulty levels, but I'm still practicing here, give me a break.","October 3, 2014","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just got out of the final boss fight and man im glad i managed to beat this game. As the title itself presents u should know this a game that does the player no favors. If u wanna beat this game u got have patience/time and the decency to try all the lvls u played again and again until u master each and everyone. Only way to beat the final boss is to use your experience and potential to your fullest (only 5.5 % of those who own the game have actually manage to win all lvls!!!)\n\nBut we go ahead of ourselves. Kung fu the warriors rise is a typical oldschool beat em up game. If u like cel shaded graphics and awesome non stop action this is the title for u. Be warned as i said before its extremely hard for average/casual players to get into this game much. The hard gameplay and the not so usual keyboard setting make it a very difficult game to win. U wont guess the times i  had to play over and over some lvls just to manage to pass the initial wave of enemies. But thats where its beauty lies.\n\nAs u progress the game and its challenges become harder and harder, somewhere deep deep down u are getting pumped up to win just for the lol of it. I enjoyed many moments like that and lemme tell u when i finally got to win the final boss i just screamed ♥♥♥♥ yeah. One of the few that has the potential to unlock that dynamic in u. Besides that u can relive those awesome 90s/80s scenes where one man beats up hord of enemies with his kung fu ultimately becoming the ultimate badass! Dont forget the world of martial arts is a continuous evolution therefore u can unlock new moves and new gear to help u in your journey. Think u got what it takes to win? If so be ready for one heck of a trill!\n\nIf u are a fan of hardcore games that test u to the limit this is the game for u. If not i strongly recommend you, not to buy it even if u like these kind of games. This title requires like The Duke said "Balls of Steel".  I myself loved every rage and tears of joy i spent on it. Definetely recommend it!\n\nPS Awesome soundtrack!","June 23, 2014","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, looking past the inabilty to change the resolution and it's sometimes frustrating levels, it shows excellent design in it's combat system and difficulty curve.\n\nMuch like classic critical darlings such as Megaman, the game teaches you new gameplay-elements in relatively safe/easy to overcome environments, such as teaching you to kick bombs to dispatch a few groups of smaller enemies, only to end in a bossfight with a giant statue who can also prime bombs, cause chain-reactions with bombs etc.\n\nThe level of frustration fluctuates. Fun levels wherein you face pole-wielding monks are offset by gauntlets in which you face 20 enemies that can either shoot you, attack you, or do an unblockable pound with an AoE that is just slightly too big for how far your dodge-move goes.\nIt's other main issue is that it doesn't teach you two essential gameplay elements, which are critical strikes(wherein you use a (chi-)move on an enemy in the apex of it's attack), and the fact that pushing a direction twice will make you run for a short distance(which is done automatically after a dodgeroll).\n\nThe actual fighting is fantastic. Taking qeues from both beat 'em ups and modern fighting games, the game involves basic attacks which you can string into launchers, parries that can be performed in-between attacks(much like Metal Gear Rising), counter-attacks which can triple your damage on hard-hitting attacks, and even wallbounces which makes positioning in the very small arenas a key element.\n\nThis is complemented by an exceptional amount of enemy variety, decently artsy graphics, and a decent if generic soundtrack that changes tunes at just the right moments during enemy and boss encounters.\n\nKung Fu Strike is an excellent beat 'em up that does itself a disservice by calling itself oldschool. It's frustration comes from unfair levels, but the fighting mechanics are rock solid, and it doesn't put the game down enough to make it not worth your time.","August 2, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just got out of the final boss fight and man im glad i managed to beat this game. As the title itself presents u should know this a game that does the player no favors. If u wanna beat this game u got have patience/time and the decency to try all the lvls u played again and again until u master each and everyone. Only way to beat the final boss is to use your experience and potential to your fullest (only 5.5 % of those who own the game have actually manage to win all lvls!!!)\n\nBut we go ahead of ourselves. Kung fu the warriors rise is a typical oldschool beat em up game. If u like cel shaded graphics and awesome non stop action this is the title for u. Be warned as i said before its extremely hard for average/casual players to get into this game much. The hard gameplay and the not so usual keyboard setting make it a very difficult game to win. U wont guess the times i  had to play over and over some lvls just to manage to pass the initial wave of enemies. But thats where its beauty lies.\n\nAs u progress the game and its challenges become harder and harder, somewhere deep deep down u are getting pumped up to win just for the lol of it. I enjoyed many moments like that and lemme tell u when i finally got to win the final boss i just screamed ♥♥♥♥ yeah. One of the few that has the potential to unlock that dynamic in u. Besides that u can relive those awesome 90s/80s scenes where one man beats up hord of enemies with his kung fu ultimately becoming the ultimate badass! Dont forget the world of martial arts is a continuous evolution therefore u can unlock new moves and new gear to help u in your journey. Think u got what it takes to win? If so be ready for one heck of a trill!\n\nIf u are a fan of hardcore games that test u to the limit this is the game for u. If not i strongly recommend you, not to buy it even if u like these kind of games. This title requires like The Duke said "Balls of Steel".  I myself loved every rage and tears of joy i spent on it. Definetely recommend it!\n\nPS Awesome soundtrack!","June 23, 2014","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The fights are very fast and incredibly fun because of their simplicity. While ingame you can move around on a stage in 360 and fight multiple enemies and bosses that will appear, all you have to do is to press mostly 3 buttons. Holding the fight button while make the char attack with very quick and nice to look at combomoves. The other fightbutton while charge airmoves at the enemies, just simply hold it pressed, too. pressing both simultanly will result in a special move, also there is evade and blocking. What sounds pretty simplistic in the beginning is incredibly fun to look at and fight with since it kind of looks like dbz. I only paid 1,49 so don't expect much in storytelling and graphics, ist mostly fighting with a little story, shown with some text and pictures and of course closely looked at low textures. The game is really challenging, tho and filled with lot of different kinds of enemies and bosses, what makes it so addicting. There is a coop you can use to play it on one pc, you can choose to use the same keyboard or two controllers. I recommend using a pad. A great buy, its fun, simple yet challenging, looks increbile in fights and very cheap~ 4/5","April 14, 2013","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has 2-player coop or vs. mode, though.\n\nThe kind of game you'd play with a buddy or even your girlfriend. I'd recommend playing this with an XBOX 360 controller, as this is a ported game. Makes it much easier. Take a buddy, plug in two controllers and unleash the Kung Fu Fighting..","August 12, 2012","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The difficulty is bonkers, and the amount of joy you get from playing this game is also bonkers. If you can stand difficult games and repeating the same levels over and over again, you will find this game to be somewhat addicting. With it's fast paced action and varied moveset (you do have to unlock pretty much everything though) this game is a blast to play and see in action. Its greatest problem is the difficulty, this game doesn't have a difficulty spike as much as a difficulty asymptote, it starts normal, then ramps up a bit then just jumps into infinity for a good chunk of levels (specially in the MIDDLE, when you have to deal with a lot of explosives and stone enemies), then the difficulty gets a bit less crazy then it jumps once again into infinity towards the last few levels.","August 13, 2015","true","33.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Guard breaking takes a random but always too-long amount of time, making it impossible when facing multiple enemies and of questionable use when you do manage to pull it off, as it puts vulnerable enemies outside of Loh's prohibitively short range. Physics-based encounters involving explosives demand more mobility than Loh, possessing only a cumbersome roll and no dedicated jump button to speak of, actually has. KFS's touted "jaw dropping combos" are nearly impossible to execute by mid game due to sheer enemy quantity, most of whom possess the ability to interrupt them on a whim. It doesn't take long for Loh's meaty arsenal to be reduced to special attacks and parries as his only valid tools, making what should be a fast-paced and energetic beat-em-up an almost purely defensive game of blocking and waiting for meters to fill. KFS describes itself as a hard game, when in fact it's merely a long one, demanding far too much time for much too little pay out when better, fairer, and indeed, more difficult games exist in the form of Godhand, Dark Souls, or even One Finger Death Punch.","July 3, 2015","false","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just got out of the final boss fight and man im glad i managed to beat this game. As the title itself presents u should know this a game that does the player no favors. If u wanna beat this game u got have patience/time and the decency to try all the lvls u played again and again until u master each and everyone. Only way to beat the final boss is to use your experience and potential to your fullest (only 5.5 % of those who own the game have actually manage to win all lvls!!!)\n\nBut we go ahead of ourselves. Kung fu the warriors rise is a typical oldschool beat em up game. If u like cel shaded graphics and awesome non stop action this is the title for u. Be warned as i said before its extremely hard for average/casual players to get into this game much. The hard gameplay and the not so usual keyboard setting make it a very difficult game to win. U wont guess the times i  had to play over and over some lvls just to manage to pass the initial wave of enemies. But thats where its beauty lies.\n\nAs u progress the game and its challenges become harder and harder, somewhere deep deep down u are getting pumped up to win just for the lol of it. I enjoyed many moments like that and lemme tell u when i finally got to win the final boss i just screamed ♥♥♥♥ yeah. One of the few that has the potential to unlock that dynamic in u. Besides that u can relive those awesome 90s/80s scenes where one man beats up hord of enemies with his kung fu ultimately becoming the ultimate badass! Dont forget the world of martial arts is a continuous evolution therefore u can unlock new moves and new gear to help u in your journey. Think u got what it takes to win? If so be ready for one heck of a trill!\n\nIf u are a fan of hardcore games that test u to the limit this is the game for u. If not i strongly recommend you, not to buy it even if u like these kind of games. This title requires like The Duke said "Balls of Steel".  I myself loved every rage and tears of joy i spent on it. Definetely recommend it!\n\nPS Awesome soundtrack!","June 23, 2014","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However if you try to play it with local coop, the autofocus of the AI will just make it frustratingly difficult and somewhat broken. (Unless you lower the difficulty but what kind of monster would do that.)\n\nThe story is a mess of martial art stereotypes and goes from simply bad to hilariously stupid. You have the old master, the busty female assassin and of course our generic protagonist. Just skipping it might actually improve it.\n\nWhile there are many types of opponents, like the swordman, the kickmaster, the big guy, the backstabbing assassin and more which are quite interesting to fight against, you are stuck with the same old character who just develops very slightly over the course of the story.\n\nLike I said, it's not a bad game at all, but I can only recommend it for people who like a challenge and are not so much into co-op or storytelling.\n\nIf that doesn't matter for you, then you can expect a lot of fun, fighting the often very hard boss fights and beating the different stages the game has to offer.","January 21, 2014","true","15.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music is excellent and is used to signal turning points in the battles.\nDespite the complaints I’ve read, I find the battle system beautiful. It looks and feels like a kung-fu movie of old. The game incorporates enough basic battle moves and concepts to allow the design of true fighting strategies:  chain combo attacks, evasions, blocks, block-breakers, critical hits, critical hit breakers and henchmen summoning. All bosses obey the system, and the side that can best exploit it will be the victor.\nThe game’s only flaw is the combination of a lack of targeting with a dynamic camera, which causes missed attacks and rage-fueled baldness.","June 26, 2014","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once you start whaling on someone, it's very much like DBZ... with better sound effects.\n\nDespite that, it's more like Onimusha with your fists; without all the *expletive* that comes with a terrible port (though the Options menu is severely lacking by PC standards).\nThe story isn't to do with daemons, though; you are General Loh. You have been tasked with requisitioning a Dojo for your battle against The Rebels.\nThough a master of Kung Fu, Loh is dismissive of the tenets pertaining to; at least the potential for slight chuckles.\nLoh is nowhere near as (readily) nimble as Onimusha; no doubt, with practice, Loh can float and glide around the arenas just as well as Oni', but the default dodge is a pitiful roll (invest in Air Dodge ASAP).\n\n\nTerrible camera:\nAt times - if the fight is in a corner, but spills momentarily out of it - the camera tries to adjust accordingly, making for a nauseating in-out-in-out or disorient(at)ing revolutions.\nI got through Chapter 1 - final fight is on a roof against Swordsman; he is prone to jump so that half his body is cut off  the top of the screen. That, actually, might be because of the resolution that the game has been forced into(?) (didn't see an option for it) or maybe even just the bosses' health bars.\nI'm now fighting the Master of the Dojo, though, and the camera is still... wonky.\nThis causes one to be prone to not connect because of perspective.\nAgain, I can only emphasize Air Dodge. It's the most effective tactic I've found thus far (...and, in my opinion - still learning the ropes - that's not saying much).\n\nI don't understand blocking:\nLoh moves in a way that throws me off - game prompts "Tap B [at the correct time]," but, with that motion, I don't know when's the time.\nHaven't found a Practice mode and it seems that every enemy, with their unique attacks, requires a different approach to it.\nSeems like it's necessary to allow for a split-second before the enemy actually attacks; he moves his hands in a sweeping manner. It isn't a standard block - it leads me to believe it's as if he catches the enemies' attacks... gotta give it more time.\n\nNothing but arena after arena; not even a linear path to run down\n(yet, at least - there are checkpoints apparently).\n\n\nContrary to how it may look, the game is not (necessarily) a button-masher. Neutralize the enemies when you have the chance, but always be on your toes.\n\nThe two worst things in the game: Camera -- Combat seems unbalanced.\nThis next bit may be attributed to my inability to "git gud":\n\nEnemies are able to damn-near spam their Heavy Attacks, whereas you must wait considerably longer for your Chi to charge. They can interrupt your attacks with blocks or attacks of their own; I think the rule is "If their feet are firmly planted, beware."\n'S'far's I know, you can't cancel any of your actions.\nAir Dodge. It's not necessarily a button-masher.\n\n\nThe graphics are stylized, to the point I'm not sure when they'll be considered outdated. The one exception is Master Mo... his head... looks like he belongs in a budget PS2 game, while the rest of the models look (almost(?)) cell-shaded.\n"Cutscenes" are presented in series of four illustrations with subtitles, a la comic book.\nThere is a shop to buy new Attacks and (")Equipment(") and also a "My Army"; certain enemies will drop scrolls that you can use to call Allies (provided you pay for them too).\nThat Equipment and your Allies must be bought before you enter the level; they are one-use items.\n\n\nI recommend this game, for all the frustration it may cause.\nIt satisfies the need I have had since I found a copy of Fighting Force a few years back (and subsequently cried into my pillow for the loss of the glory days). Though I do believe that Onimusha is the closest comparison I can make, I treat it as a fast-paced Fighting Force; that camera, the inability to cancel actions, etc.\n\nFor the rest of y'all, the more appropriate comparison to Onimusha should be enough to convince.\nIt's fun.\nIt's (")hard(").\nIt's Kung Fu.","May 9, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its got coop, for that nostalgic "Double dragon like" feeling, and also playing 2 players reduces a bit the stress in stages where there is a boss. If you coordinate correctly one can lure while your friend pummels the boss.\n\nClose to the end of the game the difficulty becomes very challenging, almost frustrating, so I recommend doing your first run on easy unless you are a master of button timing or really masochistic.

As you start out, the game teaches you how your Chi-attacks (or whatever the red glowing attacks are called) break enemies' Chi-attacks, for example- the further you play, the less true that becomes. Sure, they are the only attacks that might break enemies' Chi-attacks, but that does not mean that they necessarily will, if the hitbox decides otherwise.\n\nThere is, for instance, a fight where when you attack the AI, they dodge your attack and counter-attack with a Chi-attack, but it's very hard to block (pretty sure it's the most timing-crucial thing in the game I have encountered) and if you try to counter their Chi-attack with your own, it will hit them, then drop them out of it (if you did WW kicks), and then they will punish you with another Chi-attack for half your health, You are punished for countering their counter. Did I mention you fight two of them at the same time?\n\nIn essence, I would only recommend this game to masochists, as it simply isn't a fair game. I still have a blast with it, but it also gets super frustrating. If you don't mind that kind of unfair design, this is a very fine & addictive game with DMC-style combo mechanics and the only other tangible flaw I could find was the camera, which can be somewhere between inconvenient and outright terrible to the extent of flying off in a wrong direction because of it.\n\n6.5/10, would buy again in a sale.\n\nP.S.: Very playable on arcade sticks, which is always a plus in my book!","August 23, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However if you try to play it with local coop, the autofocus of the AI will just make it frustratingly difficult and somewhat broken. (Unless you lower the difficulty but what kind of monster would do that.)\n\nThe story is a mess of martial art stereotypes and goes from simply bad to hilariously stupid. You have the old master, the busty female assassin and of course our generic protagonist. Just skipping it might actually improve it.\n\nWhile there are many types of opponents, like the swordman, the kickmaster, the big guy, the backstabbing assassin and more which are quite interesting to fight against, you are stuck with the same old character who just develops very slightly over the course of the story.\n\nLike I said, it's not a bad game at all, but I can only recommend it for people who like a challenge and are not so much into co-op or storytelling.\n\nIf that doesn't matter for you, then you can expect a lot of fun, fighting the often very hard boss fights and beating the different stages the game has to offer.","January 21, 2014","true","15.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once you start whaling on someone, it's very much like DBZ... with better sound effects.\n\nDespite that, it's more like Onimusha with your fists; without all the *expletive* that comes with a terrible port (though the Options menu is severely lacking by PC standards).\nThe story isn't to do with daemons, though; you are General Loh. You have been tasked with requisitioning a Dojo for your battle against The Rebels.\nThough a master of Kung Fu, Loh is dismissive of the tenets pertaining to; at least the potential for slight chuckles.\nLoh is nowhere near as (readily) nimble as Onimusha; no doubt, with practice, Loh can float and glide around the arenas just as well as Oni', but the default dodge is a pitiful roll (invest in Air Dodge ASAP).\n\n\nTerrible camera:\nAt times - if the fight is in a corner, but spills momentarily out of it - the camera tries to adjust accordingly, making for a nauseating in-out-in-out or disorient(at)ing revolutions.\nI got through Chapter 1 - final fight is on a roof against Swordsman; he is prone to jump so that half his body is cut off  the top of the screen. That, actually, might be because of the resolution that the game has been forced into(?) (didn't see an option for it) or maybe even just the bosses' health bars.\nI'm now fighting the Master of the Dojo, though, and the camera is still... wonky.\nThis causes one to be prone to not connect because of perspective.\nAgain, I can only emphasize Air Dodge. It's the most effective tactic I've found thus far (...and, in my opinion - still learning the ropes - that's not saying much).\n\nI don't understand blocking:\nLoh moves in a way that throws me off - game prompts "Tap B [at the correct time]," but, with that motion, I don't know when's the time.\nHaven't found a Practice mode and it seems that every enemy, with their unique attacks, requires a different approach to it.\nSeems like it's necessary to allow for a split-second before the enemy actually attacks; he moves his hands in a sweeping manner. It isn't a standard block - it leads me to believe it's as if he catches the enemies' attacks... gotta give it more time.\n\nNothing but arena after arena; not even a linear path to run down\n(yet, at least - there are checkpoints apparently).\n\n\nContrary to how it may look, the game is not (necessarily) a button-masher. Neutralize the enemies when you have the chance, but always be on your toes.\n\nThe two worst things in the game: Camera -- Combat seems unbalanced.\nThis next bit may be attributed to my inability to "git gud":\n\nEnemies are able to damn-near spam their Heavy Attacks, whereas you must wait considerably longer for your Chi to charge. They can interrupt your attacks with blocks or attacks of their own; I think the rule is "If their feet are firmly planted, beware."\n'S'far's I know, you can't cancel any of your actions.\nAir Dodge. It's not necessarily a button-masher.\n\n\nThe graphics are stylized, to the point I'm not sure when they'll be considered outdated. The one exception is Master Mo... his head... looks like he belongs in a budget PS2 game, while the rest of the models look (almost(?)) cell-shaded.\n"Cutscenes" are presented in series of four illustrations with subtitles, a la comic book.\nThere is a shop to buy new Attacks and (")Equipment(") and also a "My Army"; certain enemies will drop scrolls that you can use to call Allies (provided you pay for them too).\nThat Equipment and your Allies must be bought before you enter the level; they are one-use items.\n\n\nI recommend this game, for all the frustration it may cause.\nIt satisfies the need I have had since I found a copy of Fighting Force a few years back (and subsequently cried into my pillow for the loss of the glory days). Though I do believe that Onimusha is the closest comparison I can make, I treat it as a fast-paced Fighting Force; that camera, the inability to cancel actions, etc.\n\nFor the rest of y'all, the more appropriate comparison to Onimusha should be enough to convince.\nIt's fun.\nIt's (")hard(").\nIt's Kung Fu.","May 9, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Guard breaking takes a random but always too-long amount of time, making it impossible when facing multiple enemies and of questionable use when you do manage to pull it off, as it puts vulnerable enemies outside of Loh's prohibitively short range. Physics-based encounters involving explosives demand more mobility than Loh, possessing only a cumbersome roll and no dedicated jump button to speak of, actually has. KFS's touted "jaw dropping combos" are nearly impossible to execute by mid game due to sheer enemy quantity, most of whom possess the ability to interrupt them on a whim. It doesn't take long for Loh's meaty arsenal to be reduced to special attacks and parries as his only valid tools, making what should be a fast-paced and energetic beat-em-up an almost purely defensive game of blocking and waiting for meters to fill. KFS describes itself as a hard game, when in fact it's merely a long one, demanding far too much time for much too little pay out when better, fairer, and indeed, more difficult games exist in the form of Godhand, Dark Souls, or even One Finger Death Punch.","July 3, 2015","false","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Controls are however very simple compared to the lengthy complex combos of any of those other games, since you get by with basically 3 keys for combat (J, K and L/Space; all are rebindable) and of course the WASD keys for movement. The combat centers around using the j and k keys to punch and kick your opponents until they start guarding against either just punches or kicks at which point you switch to using your the other attack type in order to break their guard and continue your combo.\n\nBoth you and enemy mobs can also use "chi attacks" which have various special effects including repelling enemies around you, dealing increased dmg, or stealing health. It's possible to interrupt enemy chi attacks (they glow red) with your own to deal additional damage. You start with a basic "dragon kick" chi attack that can be used by pressing the J and K buttons at the same time. You learn more chi attacks by picking up what I assume are random drops, called technique scrolls. These seem to spawn at the end of various stages after you've defeated everything there. Now I say that they are random only because the game gives zero indication of how I unlocked them and I don't seem to be doing so in any particular order or by achieving a certain score on any level; hell replaying some of the earlier levels poorly has given me scrolls just as often as playing later levels well. So I STILL have no idea how these things are awarded after beating the game and no I haven't unlocked all of them yet either. Also to add to the stupidity of this collectable system is that it is not sufficient to just unlock them (randomly). You also need to pay for them too. Given that there is little to spend on when you haven't unlocked these random scrolls this shouldn't be a big deal... However you also use the money to summon soldiers from your army so I ended up never using the army because I didn't want to grind for money to unlock scrolls after. So a whole gameplay mechanic goes unused because grinding is a pain.\n\nIn terms of defence the L/Space keys can be held for either a short period of time or somewhat longer to deflect incoming attacks and stagger opponents allowing for you to interrupt an enemy's combo and start/resume your own. BUT USING THE DEFLECT FREEZES YOU IN POSITION. Alternatively it's possible to perform a dodge roll or air dodge (you can "jump" by pressing k once; k also doubles as your kick button) by pressing the L key and an appropriate directional key to dodge in a particular direction.\n\nThere is one other gameplay mechanic I mentioned briefly called the army which lets you "equip" various types of soldiers (usually some variety of enemy soldier from one of the in-game levels) to your character. In the middle of combat a random enemy drop called the "horn" may spawn and then you can pay a fee to summon all the soldiers you equipped. Conceptually I liked this idea but like the technique collection it's entirely random as to what soldiers you get and from what level with what score. Also since this costs money you need to grind to use the tougher soldiers. Not that it matters since they're going to be outnumbered and die to enemy spam as well.\n\nKFS goes from being a simple beat em up to what feels more like a bullet hell game. The game does not hesitate to throw a ton of enemies at you so that using the L button to deflect basically becomes pointless since any time you try to deflect there will just be so many attacks coming in a slightly staggered fashion that you CANNOT possibly block them all. Most enemies are smart enough that once they stagger you they and their buddies will start spamming their own series of attacks turning any single defensive failure into an opportunity to lose a ton of HP. Timing is supposed to be everything where the deflect mechanic is concerned but there's just no way you can defend against all the incoming attacks half the time. But then what about the dodge mechanic right? That still works right? It sort of does, I mean early on you can get away with dodging away from various enemies indefinitely but various special enemies can move faster across the screen that you do during one of your dodges so it's hardly practical to spend the entire game dodging around. Even when enemies are slower than you it doesn't matter since their numbers are enough that one will corner you.\n\n\nKFS also has a considerable amount of variety in terms of enemies and some seem fair while others are infuriating as hell. An example of the more annoyingones is the "mini-boss" the shadow who has a special attack that requires you hit the deflect button twice in a row (not that there is any indication you should in the game; I only figured this out once by accident and second by visiting a forum). Oh also once she gets low on health she creates a clone of herself with the exact same amount of health and annoying abilities. The shadow is introduced as a mini-boss but later on she basically becomes a "special" varient enemy that teams up against you with other mobs. It's nice to see this kind of game not just simply introduce dynasty warriors-esque basic mobs but also some tougher ones but it can get ridiculous when you're dealing with 3 types of enemies with completely different attack patterns attacking at the same time, with at least 2 of them being able to bypass your deflect entirely.\n\nBosses also add to the "fun" of playing a beat-em-up that's also a bullet hell. KFS loves to introduce minibosses that become demoted "special" enemies like the shadow I just mentioned but the few truly unique bosses tend to have what amount to bullet hell AoEs. They walk around with glowing circles around them that if you step inside will immediately trigger an animation in which they hit you with an unblockable high damage attack. These glowing circles change direction frequently and the boss will generally be moving towards you and be surrounded by various low tier enemies at the same time. The low tier enemies will try to kill you and probably fail horribly but while you're dealing with them, and attacking the boss itself, the glowing circles will constantly be chasing you as well. The game also loves throwing projectile tossing enemies at you in the middle of these fights as well (shurikens/arrows and bombs are the most common) and while you can deflect some of these projectiles back this requires hitting them with either your own attacks (which is difficult with keyboard and mouse scheme) or using the deflect technique. Doing so is mostly pointless since there will always be more projectiles coming in and more enemies out to kill you that will attack at the same time; you yourself cannot use any projectiles whatsoever.\n\nAlso I'm not even going to touch on how stupid the levels where your character is poisoned and loses health continuously are.\n\nTo summarize this is NOT just a beat em up game. Yeah the early levels are super easy but the second that the game starts introducing special variant enemies or worse projectile tossing enemies the difficulty curve basically busts through the ceiling. The game is not impossible and it can be beaten with perseverance and skill HOWEVER anytime I beat the game it was consistently by the skin of my teeth. While there are truly difficult games out there that are lots of fun what sets those games apart is that once you come up with a solution to difficult situation and execute it perfectly you can easily beat any level. I can beat this game without any such skillfull execution by dodging around lke an idiot and I certainly don't learn anything about how to play when the game lets me get away with this.\n\nThe game should be fun and it has so many great ideas but its a total mixed bag in terms of gameplay.","March 4","false","23.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It turns out; this is one of the few games I cannot recommend, even at a steep discount.\nThe idea behind the game is a good one. Kung Fu fighting, over the top combos and bad guys to use them on, and a solid artistic style should all combine into something great and fun to play. The reality is that the execution of the idea is horrible.\n\nWhile there is some skill involved, the fighting unpolished. Against some foes, blocking and deflecting works just fine. Others, particularly some of the female fighters, any attempts at blocking, deflecting, or dodging are completely ignored or are too inconstant to work with. The bad guys can change direction mid attack, catching you from an odd angle, slam you around like you are a doll, and then deftly block whatever you do to try to fight back. Levels frequently throw aggravating and painful gimmicks like exploding vases to add variety to the experience, but only accomplish making your blood pressure rise as they blast you into the air in unblockable, unbreakable combos that end up killing you without giving you a chance to recover.\n\nHad this title gotten just a little more love and attention from its developers, it would have been something great. As it stands, it is a jumbled pile of good ideas that never comes together.\n","May 29","false","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
