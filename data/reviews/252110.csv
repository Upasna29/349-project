Talk about exciting! It kind of reminds me of Star Trek mixed with PixelJunk Shooter. The Star Trek part is how you have to move your character from station to station to control different systems (weapons, sheilds, helm, cannon) and the PixelJunk Shooter part is pretty much everything else! If you're looking for a good co-op game, you've found it.\n\nPros:\n+ Fantastically original aesthetic.\n+ Unique gameplay.\n+ Interesting enemies\n+ Very challenging, but doesn't feel unfair.\n+ Simple controls.\n\nCons:\n-No online co-op. Doesn't really matter to me, but is sure to be a deal-breaker for some.","September 9, 2015","true","11.5"," 111 of 118 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","111","118","6","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/252110/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is a space style action shooter with heavy co-op elements. The game was released on Steam and Xbox One in September 2015 by indie developer Asteroid Base.\n\nWhilst the game is focuses on the co-op element, the game can be played alone. You are in command of a space ship with a companion, in the single player this is a partly UI controlled pet, dog or cat, when playing co-op, the other player controls this character. The space ship has various seats that must be commanded in order for that part of the ship to be active, the seats consist of outer canons,  rotating gun, shields, maps and boosters; so that means only two parts of the ship can be active at one time. When playing single player, the UI controlled companion makes for a perfect rider of the ships weaponry as they can shoot targets even when you can't actually see them on the screen. I was quite happy to man the direction of the ship for the majority of the play through and just used the companion to switch between the more skill targeted seats. The actual aim in the game is to collect kidnapped space bunnies - these are spread out across the levels and some are not easy to find due to a fog of war feature also being included.  Whilst exploring and destroying other enemies, you will collect upgrades for your ships; these upgrades can be used on any of the ship's compartments, such as turning your canons into rail guns, or upgrading your ships boosters to go even faster.\n\nLovers in a Dangerous Spacetime has a really neat graphic style - the neon art really shines through and actually fits in well with the gameplay. The bosses in this game look awesome; they look like something a child would drawer but have a real mature look about them. There isn't any voice acting though which I thought is a real shame given that there is a fair amount of text to be read. The soundtrack is stellar, and all of the sound effects are nice too.\n\nThere are two levels of difficulties, easy and medium. I actually found the medium level to be really intensive, and actually had to drop the difficulty down on some of the levels - it's nice to see a game have challenging gameplay. This game takes a huge amount of skill to master it properly.\n\nEvery level in Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is randomly generated; meaning no play through is ever the same. There are four chapters, and each chapter consists of four levels with a boss fight at the end. All of the regular levels have the same aim as noted above, collecting the space bunnies/frogs/ducks and foxes.\n\nI finished the game in just under four hours; so it is fairly short, but it has the added bonus of having the local multiplayer option which is absolutely huge - this ramps the replay ability up tenfold for me, given that all of the maps are randomly generated, you can play this game for hours on end with a buddy on the couch.\n\nTechnically, this is a sound game; I was able to play on 4K resolutions, with in game options too.  A controller is recommended to play though; whilst keyboard and mouse is viable, you will definitely get more out of using a controller as the analogue stick makes a big difference when controlling the ship. The game does offer a fairly expansive tutorial too; and this gets you to grips with the controls very easily as it guides you through everything step by step.\n\nIn conclusion; Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is a top notch title; a really fantastic art style and with an innovative take on the co-op controls of a ship, this is special game. If you only plan on playing this game on your own, you may find the price tag of £10,99 to be a little much, but if you are going to be playing it on co-op with friends, then you are going to get more than your money’s worth out of this game. This is certainly a game to keep installed even after completing it!\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

The best way to play is with a friend because of the constant need to shuffle around the different stations. Despite its adorable art style the game can be surprisingly difficult, and I often found myself finishing levels by the skin of my teeth. You can cruise a bit in early levels, but if you don't pay attention you can quickly find yourself on the way to exploding.\n\nThe single player is good too because you get to command an AI cat or dog! The AI does a good job of killing enemies, manning the shields etc. The only limitation is that they can't drive which is understandable since it would take additional commands to tell the pet where to steer towards.\n\nThe new levels also are always adding new mechanics which mix up the formula and keeps things from getting stale. Water planets, ice planets, enemies that can only be defeated by ricochet-ing shots from a star etc. And also unique boss battles for each section.\n\nThere's a nice progression system of upgrades where by saving more bunnies (or frogs) you get more points towards upgrades that unlock stations that can fit more gems to modify your weapons and eventually unlock ships with different layouts. I feel bad for leaving any of the space bunnies behind so I'll definitely be trying to go back to save more of them in future playthroughs.\n\nUnique premise, lovely art style, and really kickass soundtrack. One of the most unique games you'll play, highly recommended!","September 9, 2015","true","8.0"," 56 of 64 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","56","64","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/torchiest/recommended/252110/","torchiest","Torchiest","http://steamcommunity.com/id/torchiest/","505 products in account","LiaDS is a very cool game. You are on a mission to restore love to the galaxy in your spaceship, with either one player and an AI helper, or local co-op. It has a pretty unique gimmick, in that you must move your characters from station to station in order to control parts of the ship you're flying. What this means in practice is that most of the time one person will be flying the ship, while the other moves between the guns and the shields defending you. In special circumstances both players will have to man the defenses while the ship idles.\n\nThe graphics are super cutesy, and they belie the absolutely punishing difficulty of this game. You'll need a competent second player to match the excellent performance of your AI pet, who zips between stations at your command and just kicks butt on the regular. But when things are in a groove and the chaos is all around you, the game is incredibly satisfying. And the good number of power-up combinations keeps things interesting. Just be prepared for the occasional frustration as the hordes of attackers wipe you out yet again.\n\nThe unique mechanic of only being able to control one station at a time makes this game feel like a mix between FTL: Faster Than Light and a shoot-em-up. It's honestly inspiring to see such an innovative gameplay concept these days, when it sometimes feels like all the genres possible have been conceived already. Which is to say, I can see this as the foundation of a new genre, much like Minecraft single-handedly brough the crafting genre into existence. It's that good. I found it intriguing enough that I bought it at only a small discount, which is incredibly rare for me.\n\nEDIT: Having played this game a few more hours, my estimation of it continues to increase. Rather than getting stale, it's becoming more entertaining the deeper I go. The power up combinations hold some amazing surprises, the music is fantastic, and the game is so well put together and so polished, it's like the distilled essence of joy to play it. I'm willing to call it the best game of the year right now.","September 12, 2015","true","97.8"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","20","21","2","0"

Haven't played this on my own.\n\ntl;dr two people in a hard-to-control spaceship collect friends and defeat bosses in 2D generated galaxies, pew pew, yay, love is returned! *squeaky noise here*\n\nWith two people, it's one of the best couch co-op games I've played on PC, and is very true to the 'co-operative' label. It requires good teamwork, constant communication and occasionally a bit of yelling at each other. The horrifically twee 'storyline' (if I read the word "love" one more time, I might hit someone), very cutesy art style and that little dance thing that happens whenever your characters pass each other can help lighten things a bit when they a bit more tense. I haven't seen another game quite like it.\n\nThat said, this isn't a game either of us would play again. There's just enough variety in the game for one playthrough, but probably not more, not with the same person. It was worth the purchase just to try it out though, and I do recommend it. When the four-player comes out, we'll be playing it again with friends. Could be the best/worst double date ever.\n\nOne last thing:  I say controllers are required.

Love is the flavour of everyday…. Interplanetary peace and love, should we say! Unfortunately, an error in the matrix (in the Ardor Reactor) has damaged the reactor. An explosion occurred and as a result it split in four pieces. But this is the least of your predicaments; the fault allowed the dark forces of Anti-Love to breakout and spread through the galaxy. Your goal is to recover the four pieces of the reactor to save the galaxy.\n\nLovers in Dangerous Spacetime is a local co-op game setup in a space environment.  You and your AI companion (or a friend in local co-op) will be in command of a circular spaceship prototype to save the galaxy. The vessel has eight stations, four guns (north, south, east and west), one shield, one scanner, one super weapon and one engine station. All can be upgraded by collecting gems and you could end up with an interesting combination of weapons, from lasers to missiles or even a giant flail - how cool is that? You will have several missions per sector and will have to save a minimum of five folks (bunnies or frogs) to unlock the escape portal to finish your assignment. You will face a good mixture of enemies (including bosses) in well-designed levels. Also, every time you start a new campaign, levels will randomly generate themselves which adds so much in terms of replay ability.\n\nI would strongly recommend using a gamepad for this game as the keyboard setup is actually not the way to go.

While the AI follows your orders rather well, the lack of him being able to navigate can lead to gameplay that has pacing problems in that case. The core firing and enemy variety does help the game rather well, and the aesthetic is rather nice without being in your face. Upgrade system is rather nice and interesting in the way it combines weapons. Basically, if you're looking for a local co-op experience to play with a friend in a shoot em up nature: this works rather well.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: http://youtu.be/5JxyEvsr5q8\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nLocal Co-Op sets up gameplay that reinforces communication with your partner and creates an environment to get the chat going rather well.\nLike the upgrade system and the different combinations that can be created from it. Things like the laser mace are interesting in their combination.\nAesthetic is nice without being too in your face with colors. The best laid back neon style I've seen in a while.\nSoundtrack is soothing, not too over the top and fits the game rather well. Good laid back feel.\nEnemy variety works with different ways of having to deal with them.\nAI is competent in firing, and in particular in using the shield against the right enemy at the time.\n-:\nReally would have done well to have online multiplayer. Again, sensitive to the amount of programming that it would take, but I really think it would have taken this game, which is obviously co-op focused, to the next level.\nSingle player does lack in compared to local co-op experience due to the lack of AI being able to navigate, although understandable given the amount of work to program pathfinding would be.\nGame can feel samey rather quickly. In particular, the game's pace is rather slow.

The gameplay is solid, the art is splendid, and the story is enjoyable fluff. And here, you actually need your partner. Even when this means certain doom, it makes for a better experience.\n\nThe early levels don't expect too much and are great for easing in a partner relatively new to games, but later on (especially the last campaign or two) you may want to switch to easy. Easy mode may still almost guarantee a win in those later campaigns, but it won't ruin the sense of accomplishment through cooperation.\n\nIf you are playing with someone that doesn't play games quite as much, you may find yourself more pigeonholed into certain roles (especially piloting and shielding), but you'll still find time to move about to the weapons systems. More importantly, you'll both be having fun.\n\nSingle-player is fine enough, but it will feel a little lacking if you've played with someone else. That's not really a fault of the game, as the AI partner performs well (and better than anyone I played with). It's just not as compelling as having a human to work with (and around), someone who isn't there just to obey your whims.","October 1, 2015","true","32.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","0"

Although, because you're only 2 crew members, it's much more intense.\n\nIn singleplayer, you can tell your AI pet what to take control of. It's very competent and so can use anything but piloting the ship. You need to do that, however you're also free to let go of the wheel and command your shields, or turrets. In co-op, anyone can take control of anything. It's in 2 player mode that the game shines, in my opinion.\n\nYour main objective is to free the set amount of bunnies in each level. Once you've done that, the level exit will open. If you choose to stay and uncover the entire map, look for all possible upgrades and free all bunnies, then each level can take you between 15-30 minutes. On top of that, each time you start a new campaign, levels will be randomly generated, adding infinite replay value.\n\nThe game becomes incredibly satisfying as you upgrade your ship. Different gems can be used to modify different parts of the ship. For example. putting a pink gem on you turret will make it a triple barreled machine gun. Putting a blue gem will turn it into a yo-yo like wrecking ball. Putting a pink gem on you shield will make it cover more of your ship. Putting a yellow gem will make it smaller, but deflect projectiles. You can even combine gems to create different powerups. As you rank up. you can also unlock different ships that have different attributes. It makes the game so much fun.\n\nThe art style is incredibly cute, and the music is cool.\n\nOverall, I think this game is awesome!

You can only man one post aboard a vast adorable spaceship, either man the guns or take the helm and maneuver through enemies.

You just make the ships a bit more intricate.\nI definitely recommend this game, but to the devs:\nLOCAL CO-OP ONLY IS A BAD IDEA.\nFix this, and I'll play the hell out of it with my friends.","October 11, 2015","true","5.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

We have tried Marvel Lego Super Heroes, which is fun but slightly antisocial compared to this game which requires constant back-and-forth communication (sometimes very hectic too!).\n\nDue to the lack of online multiplayer built into this version of the game so far, I would highly recommend inviting a friend or ANY close person over just to give the 2-player potential of this game a shot.  I understand this isn't a possibility for everyone, so I can totally sympathize with those wanting online play.  I read in the official FAQ that there is only one programmer for the entire game, so the company as a whole had to pick their battles and at THIS stage, online multiplayer is out.  However that doesn't mean that they won't include it in the future, and it certainly shouldn't be a reason to grade the quality of this game down.\n\nIn the short time we've played (82 minutes as of this review), I've discovered areas in our communication that I hadenever noticed before due to the frantic nature of this game.  I realize there's a lot more to discover but already this has been a blast for us.  Besides Lovers'' necessity of communication, the vibrant colors and overall playful mood, the simple yet deep controls,  a great updgrade system, the real sense of challenge(hard but not too hard), and most of all FUN have made this a real gem in my Steam collection.","September 27, 2015","true","5.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","1"

And it was totally worth its full price!\n\nThis game has an amazingly imaginative art style that I haven't seen in any other 2D game before. Somehow Asteroid Base have managed to design something that looks cute, sharp, vibrant and colourful, yet doesn't feel childish or cringeworthy.\n\nThis is without a doubt one of the best coop-games I have ever played. Especially because it allows you to have lots of fun right from the start. Unlike some other games, where it only really opens up if you reached a certain level or got a particular upgrade.\n\nMy only complaint from the 3 hours I have played thus far is that the upgrade system can be a bit unclear at times. Why is it that I lose my upgrades between worlds? I suppose this is because of balance reasons, but this isn't communicated to the player in any way.","September 15, 2015","true","4.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I highly recommend this game to anyone that has a friend to play with locally.\n\nFor singleplayer though, I suggest you look elsewhere.  I suggest you watch some reviews first before making this purchase.\n\nFrom a singleplayer perspective, the gameplay does not flow smoothly; it feels very "stuttery".  There is quite a bit of micromanaging in this game, during battles you:  command pet to a position, move your ship, move your shields, hop onto a turret to shoot a bit, and then repeat.  Throughout the fight you're not feeling engaged in the combat, it's more about moving around so you don't get hit and let your pet do the shooting.  Overall it is just not fun, well to me anyways, to just move a ship around and not being involved in the combat while the A.I. does everything else.\n\nIf this were just a singleplayer game only, this game would get a "thumbs down", but since there is local co-op and everything about this game is very unique from art style to (co-op) gameplay, this will get "thumbs up".\n\n\n","September 9, 2015","true","1.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So much, that the game is infinitely more rewarding with more friends to play. By that token, buys beware: it is highly recommended you bring additional passengers for this ride!\n\nGreat presentation and audio make this an endearing package, with gameplay that is simple to understand, but hard to master as the levels progress. It is evident that an enormous amount of effort was invested into LiaDS, a sediment which is echoed by excellent aethestics, difficulty progression, and engaging gameplay.\n\nA few gripes do not escape this game from a hearty recommendation. Gamers who are wishing for a forgiving game will be marginally dissapointed, as after a couple hours of gameplay, the level of challenge ramps up significantly. Game levels become long, and trecherous. A misfired cannon, or an unmanned engine can potentionally lead to demise; a loss of 20-30 minutes of gameplay to restart the level.\n\nBy inverse, the game is rewarding. If you can progress in the game with enough skill and determination, you are rewarded with more gadgets and enemys to test the might of your friends and yourself.\n\nIf you are interested in a well-constructed, engaging, and fun local multiplayer game, look no further.

It's not the easiest of games, and while there is a bit of a blame game that happens, we are never frustrated by a death, we had so much fun that we just take another stab at it.\nThere are so many unique possibilities to play with for upgrades (more frantic yelling as I throw a metal gem at our turret with a beam gem to create a metal ball with lasers, while 3 turrets have not been upgraded), and the entire game feels unique that I'd call it must play if you have a player whom you can couch co-op with.","September 12, 2015","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All the game mechanics are just right and everything is so beautifully balanced that me and my boyfriend were always looking forward to seeing the next game mechanic. Cant recommnd this for someone on single player but if yuo have a buddy or lover to play with this game really shines and is totally worth the money.\n\nAlso, invest in some USB controllers because trying to play with two people on the computer is tough while using a keyboard.

Recommend you have 3-4 players, but 2 is fun too. Single player is also doable, but not nearly as fun. Takes about 20 hours to get all the achivements. Gamepad recomended. a bit short, but highly recomended to play. Very easy to pick up, so I'd recomend playing this with an SO, a double date, or random friends. The first few levels are beginner friendly with the last world getting pretty hard to rescue everyone in time. Communication and active playing is key! Also, I want to note that the animals you rescue are rabbits, frogs, foxes, and blue birds. I spent half the game joking with my friend that I was slippy toad, he was star fox, and his girlfriend was peppy hare, and when we relaized that the final animal we rescue is a blue bird, we lost it. *spoilers* the final boss has a huge face, and after you beat him, it turns into two eyeballs that attack you, just like star fox 64!

You'd think that the dynamic of having multiple control points in a ship with two little player dudes would be something really fun, but it is just not fun. Everything is slow, there's no real action. Except for bosses here and there, there's never really a sense of "danger" in the game. It's just a slow and cumbersome Super-Nintendo game (without the nostalgia). It's just not a $14.99 game to me. Maybe a $9.99 game that you could pick up on sale. It's polished, but so very boring.\n\nBest summed up analogy: This game provides about the same excitement as a conversation with Marvin, the Paranoid Android.","February 12","false","0.5"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","3","14","0","0"

The control scheme is deeply byzantine. Someone with the keyboard can overide the controller, forcing you into a single player game if you remap any of the keys. The key choice themselves are unituitive. Jump/engage is left shift, breaking from space as jump that is a core gaming premise. Remapping causes the confusing player select options above.\n\nAnother issue is the unskippable cinematics. I understand that the artists want their hard work to be seen, but when you restart a level, you are forced through them each time. This goes for the "show you the level" start as well. All cinematics should be skippable at anytime in a game.\n\nGreat concept, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired at the moment. Heres hoping they can pull it up out of the UX nosedive.","September 30, 2015","false","0.8"," 13 of 41 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","13","41","0","1"

Many have been hoping and waiting for an easy multiplayer function for this game, but at this point in time it is a co-op game.\n\nThat being said, there's nothing wrong with a co-op game.  Frankly, this hearkens back to those couch gaming days with games that test you and your partner through fun, though admittedly difficult at times, game play.\nNow, for some reason Steam does not show how much time i have actually spent in this game, so do not let that be a bias.  That's a Steam problem, not the game's nor my own.\n\nGame play: Almost solely Co-op.  Requiring much focus, multitasking, and cooperation between players.  COOPERATION IS KEY!  I would not try to play this alone (unless you have multiple controllers and arms) because, while there is AI, it can at times seem overpowered or under-powered as any AI tends to be.  However, the AI companion is either a cat or dog, so there is a slight aesthetic advantage. That said, once you do get used to the game play, it becomes super fun.\n\nVisuals and sound: simply cute and epic, as you can plainly see from the game art.  Bright, colorful, and loud.  The game is stimulating, and just the style makes the game worth playing as it keeps you engrossed in a cute/simple yet somehow simultaneously epic and destructive environment.\n\nControls: So many would suggest purchasing and programming multiple game controllers/pads, it is personally up to preference.  I remember huddling around one keyboard with friends to play co-op games on PC long ago, and got personally attached to that – not necessarily couch gaming, as you/your friends huddle around a tiny space.  Keyboard gaming really made my friends and I close.  But again, personal preference: keyboard or controller(s).\n\nStory: You (and your buddy) are super cute heroes/creatures tasked with finding pieces of the Ardor Reactor – a machine that harnesses and spreads the power of love; broken by the “Anti-Love”.  Along the way, of course, you shoot  enemies, fly around, explore, save bunnies, and everything else you would expect from super cute space travel with love as its goal.\n\nLength: This game can be played for hours on end, but is more casual and in reality short.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Think C's for this game.  This game is a cute and casual co-op, calling back to couch-gaming.  Controller(s) recommended but not necessary... Oh yeah, and... COOPERATION!","January 24","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a weird game but I had a blast with it.\n\nLovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is one of the best couch co-op games that I have played recently. While you can play the game single player, I would recommend against it since it is such a great multiplayer game. Unfortunately the game doesn't have an online mode at this time so you will need to play the game locally.\n\nWhat makes Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime such a great co-op game is that you need to work together in order to be successful. Your ship has many different stations and since you can only control one station at a time you need to work with your teammate in order to avoid destruction. The battles in particular can be really enjoyable as you are running all over your ship to get into a different station in order to destroy your enemies.\n\nThe game has a couple small issues mostly revolving around sometimes having to spend too much time exploring, but they don't really hurt the experience.\n\nIf you really like co-op games and the concept sounds at least somewhat interesting to you, I think you would really enjoy Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of the game.\n\nRead My Full Review [ http]\n","September 18, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wish it would have had a bigger gem variety for even more fun combinations. 2. I wish the game would be even longer.\n\nI have had so much fun playing this game with my boyfriend. There was some frustrated yelling at times, but that is the way it should be in a local co-up game. As you pilot your ship through the different constellations, fighting the forces of Anti-Love you experience a nice variety of worlds. We thought for a second that we had found a "winning" gem combination after having easily glided through a few levels in a row, only to have to rethink our strategy as the environment around us changed. (Curse you ice constellation!)\n\nI have also played a bit of the solo game and found the cat ai to be a very decent, and agreeable, copilot. Though if I had to choose my boyfriend remains a better shield controller. The choices the ai makes aren't always the one you could wish for.\n\nThe game is overflowing with cuteness and color, the difficulty increase in a good way to keep you sharp, and the random map creation and different gem builds is nice for replay-ability. All in all well worth the money.","September 24, 2015","true","19.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game stays quite fast paced and hectic, especially with you an your bud running up and down, left and right, trying to man the many stations all the time.  It makes even casual fights be pretty entertaining.  But, what really makes this game is the environmental hazards that force you to face enemies in increasingly uncomfortable situations.  If you attempt to focus one problem at a time, you'll eventually find that another issue will grow overwhelming.\n\nThe variety of the enemies grows quickly, but settles mid way through and many of the enemies will be similar to ones faced in the last campaign with only mild difference in tactics.  But, what always breathes new life into each level is the ever changing threats in the environment, as well as the wild boss battles.  That is always fresh, and quite exciting.\n\nI'd also recommend HEAVILY bringing a gamepad as much of the controls are not only awkward to pull off with the keyboard, but cramped if you're playing with another person on the same board.","December 3, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I actually got to preview this at PAX Prime earlier this year and it was one of the most popular titles in the indie area and with good reason. Lovers is a cooperative space exploration game where two players must cooperate to man various stations on a spaceship to navigate through space and rescue little space critters. In order to complete a level, a certain number of little space critters has to be rescued for the exit to be unlocked but if you and your partner are feeling like completionists, you can collect all of the critters in each stage to get access to different model ships and unlock other powerups faster. The locations of the critters and the entire world as a whole are totally differently systematically generated on each run, giving every playthrough a fresh feel. Once you find a critter, usually some small challenge has to be completed before you can rescue them. For example, you may have to fight several waves of enemies, escape an explosion or fight a mini boss.\n\nThere are various stations to man on each ship including weapons, shields, engines and a powerful yamato cannon weapon. There are several campaigns that are made up of 4 levels and a final boss fight. Each level offers upgrade crystals that you can install in your systems that will persist throughout the campaign. Deciding which crystals to place in which systems is initially a fun experimental learning process, but I've found once you know what the crystal combinations do, you usually fall into a pattern of upgrading that results in a familiar ship layout each time. But there are also several ship layouts to unlock in the game, each with their own stats and quirky gameplay rules. For instance, there's one unlockable ship that constantly rotates around while you play, making locating and controlling your character within the ship quite a challenge, but as a tradeoff, the ship is also immune to terrain damage. I'm a sucker for these kinds of unlockable gameplay variations and this game reminded me a bit of my favorite FTL from the space exploration and battles right down to the unlockable ships. Obviously the gameplay is nowhere close to the same, but there are similarities to be drawn between the two roguelike space exploration games\n\nThere are only two crew members, making coordination and teamwork a key to success in this game. Communication with your partner is necessary and coming up with a good strategy is vital so that you and your teammate aren't running to the same stations to man the same systems. Once you get that strategy established and you and your partner know how to run the ship like seasoned space travelers, it's a really neat feeling. But it's also just as fun to yell and scream at your partner when things are going horribly wrong and your ship is about to explode\n\nLovers in a Dangerous Spacetime offers the best experiences for couch co-op play. It's conceptually simple to learn and easy to pick up and play. But there's still a decent amount of strategy, skill and depth to be found here as well, and applying these strategies skill and depth of understanding of the game is especially necessary in the later levels where the difficulty gets ratcheted up quite a bit. I really enjoyed this game; it's one of the best couch cooperative experiences I've had.

I have yet to actually play the game with a companion AI, but it's a good way to kill time when you have another friend to play with you at your place. The concept is simple: fly around the star system, save the inhabitants of that particular galaxy (so far, I've encountered bunnies, frogs, and foxes) collect the gears needed, and fight the boss, but with the brilliant way the co-op is implemented it becomes a very addictive and fun action game.\n\nDefinitely, definitely play with a friend for this one, as it's pretty much half the fun of this game when one of you is piloting the ship and trying to run around not punching each other off stations when the enemies are shooting at you.

This game does not feel that way! You'll have lots of fun yelling at your "lover" frantically trying to decide the best strategy. The game is essentially the platforming version of the tabletop game Space Alert. Strategy and skill is required to reach various stations that operate your ship such as weapons and thrust.

I wish it would have had a bigger gem variety for even more fun combinations. 2. I wish the game would be even longer.\n\nI have had so much fun playing this game with my boyfriend. There was some frustrated yelling at times, but that is the way it should be in a local co-up game. As you pilot your ship through the different constellations, fighting the forces of Anti-Love you experience a nice variety of worlds. We thought for a second that we had found a "winning" gem combination after having easily glided through a few levels in a row, only to have to rethink our strategy as the environment around us changed. (Curse you ice constellation!)\n\nI have also played a bit of the solo game and found the cat ai to be a very decent, and agreeable, copilot. Though if I had to choose my boyfriend remains a better shield controller. The choices the ai makes aren't always the one you could wish for.\n\nThe game is overflowing with cuteness and color, the difficulty increase in a good way to keep you sharp, and the random map creation and different gem builds is nice for replay-ability. All in all well worth the money.","September 24, 2015","true","19.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I first saw the demo at the EMP Museum, I was drawn to its bright, colorful graphics. Simple, cute, but not childish. I first thought that saving bunnies was a silly concept, but I soon realized that Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime took more strategy and skill than what first appears to the eye.\nNow that I've played through the first campaign on solo, and played a few levels of co-op I can definitely say that this game lived up to and exceeded all my expectations.\n\nWith just two nauts controlling the ship, gameplay can become quite hectic and challenging. But that's half the fun! In solo mode, you get a trusty AI dog/cat that you can command to man the different stations with you. They are quick to respond and generally shoot at what you want. (Sometimes they start shooting asteroids when there are enemies that need to be gunned down first!)\n\nGameplay is challenging, and rewards players for exploring the map. If you find a "?" box on the map, shoot it open and you might get a gem you can use to power up a station! (Different gems and gem combinations change how your station is upgraded.) If you take extra time to save all 10 bunnies on a map (minimum of 5 unlocks the portal to the next level), you gain rank faster and can unlock more ships and gems slots for your ship stations. Customize your ship stations for your gameplay style!\n\nLovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is advertised as a couch co-op game. I'm not sure why people are so angry that there isn't online co-op. The gameplay style of this game takes me back to the days of co-op arcade games, or cramming all my friends and family in front of one television as we all take turns trying to beat our own records on the old gaming consoles. Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is one of those games that makes you want to invite friends over to beat together. I feel that the player experience would be different and not as special if this was not a local co-op game. But if there was an online co-op mode, you can bet this game would still be just as fun!\n\nTL;DR - This game is quickly becoming one of my favorite co-op games. Highly recommended!!

Many have been hoping and waiting for an easy multiplayer function for this game, but at this point in time it is a co-op game.\n\nThat being said, there's nothing wrong with a co-op game.  Frankly, this hearkens back to those couch gaming days with games that test you and your partner through fun, though admittedly difficult at times, game play.\nNow, for some reason Steam does not show how much time i have actually spent in this game, so do not let that be a bias.  That's a Steam problem, not the game's nor my own.\n\nGame play: Almost solely Co-op.  Requiring much focus, multitasking, and cooperation between players.  COOPERATION IS KEY!  I would not try to play this alone (unless you have multiple controllers and arms) because, while there is AI, it can at times seem overpowered or under-powered as any AI tends to be.  However, the AI companion is either a cat or dog, so there is a slight aesthetic advantage. That said, once you do get used to the game play, it becomes super fun.\n\nVisuals and sound: simply cute and epic, as you can plainly see from the game art.  Bright, colorful, and loud.  The game is stimulating, and just the style makes the game worth playing as it keeps you engrossed in a cute/simple yet somehow simultaneously epic and destructive environment.\n\nControls: So many would suggest purchasing and programming multiple game controllers/pads, it is personally up to preference.  I remember huddling around one keyboard with friends to play co-op games on PC long ago, and got personally attached to that – not necessarily couch gaming, as you/your friends huddle around a tiny space.  Keyboard gaming really made my friends and I close.  But again, personal preference: keyboard or controller(s).\n\nStory: You (and your buddy) are super cute heroes/creatures tasked with finding pieces of the Ardor Reactor – a machine that harnesses and spreads the power of love; broken by the “Anti-Love”.  Along the way, of course, you shoot  enemies, fly around, explore, save bunnies, and everything else you would expect from super cute space travel with love as its goal.\n\nLength: This game can be played for hours on end, but is more casual and in reality short.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Think C's for this game.

The basic premise is simple; you have two players operating a space ship that needs more than two people to run properly, so you end up dashing around the various engine, sheild and various weapon stations in a vaguely coordinated fashion.\n\nThis is a couch co-op game, so it runs on one computer and only one player needs a copy of the game.

Some times it sounds casual, sometimes it can be hard as hell. For me it seems like a metaphor to sharing your life with someone, having a house and a lot of tasks to orchestrate together on a daily basis. You will feel all the mess of task division and sometimes the dispair of urgent things to do, but you will have a great time in the end and occasionally may have time for a beer or two with your partner.
