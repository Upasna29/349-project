You have time to think about your every move and feel the full control over your players. I am not FIFA fan, I don't even like football. But the way developers made the game totally won me over - it is a lot like chess (my favorite board game) but with elements of RPG like gaining levels of footballers and gaining skills and tallents for them. Moreover the developers are constantly improving the game to suit player's tastes (players can pick match duration in turns, will players playing on different position get a penalty for it, will there be injuries, how fast footballer's stamina will recover and more) and provide new options and additional content. And if there happens to be a bug from what I've seen they are fast to release a fix for it - usually within hours.\n\nI don't know if all the FIFA fans would like this a bit slower and more tactical version but I recommend it to all who like turn-based strategies and RPG-type of games, at least for me it was a fun new experience that may not have as many resource types like in other strategies (fame, money in this case) but is just as fun.","December 15, 2015","true","103.0"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","29","33","0","0"

Can you lead them all the way to the premier league?\n\nThe team managing is interesting; upgrade your staff and stadium, develop your players or sell them you hire better ones. But the main focus of the game is the turn base matches which is surprinsingly addictive and tactical.\n\nFootball tactics has a lot of depth, it rewards the player for doing their "homeworks" before each game. Adapting your formation to your opponent's and using your most relevant players really helps the achieve sucess. That makes for a great stategy game.\n\nStill in early access, the game is very stable. I mostly used the beta version and it crashed only once in almost 200 hours of gameplay. Had a few minors bugs that I'm sure will be fixed (some of them already are), but nothing serious or gamebreaking.\n\nRecommended for anyone who likes strategy and team management games.

Well, don‚Äôt look further, they are all playing Football Tactics!!\n\nFootball Tactics is a football manager game using a turn-based system during match day which gives this game its originality.\n\nFirst you will have to choose which team and in which country you will be playing. Then, the Amateur League will start. This league is realistically a tutorial and will help you to understand how to play the game and you will probably find it quite easy. As soon as you move up to the next league, the difficulty will increase straight away and you will be facing tougher opponents. In total, you have 5 leagues and 2 cups to play in and the aim is to reach and win the Premier League and the Cups, of course.\n\nThe management aspect of the game has good depth but it is easy to use and understand. I really like it that way. You can . . . upgrade your stadium to get more attendance and revenue, upgrade your youth academy so you can find better young talents, purchase new players during the transfer window, get specific coaches and assistants so your players improve their skills (but you will need prestige points). How do you get prestige points, you may ask? Really simple, if the goal difference is  1 in your favour then you will get 1 prestige point. If you manage to finish the season in the top 3 teams, you will be rewarded with additional prestige points.\n\nMatch day ‚Äì Each half will consist of 24 action moves to be used between each team, with a total of 48 moves per match. Remember, you and your opponent will use 3 action moves per turn. They are plenty of moves to make your mark and score goals. At the end of each match, your player will get experience points which in turn will help them to reach a higher level. If you win, you‚Äôll get higher experience points.\n\nThe graphics are smooth and polished and the game runs well. This game is an early access and it is very impressive so far. Please bring on the full version, I can‚Äôt wait!\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Good and easy Football Management\n-	Turn-based match day\n-	Really fun to play\n-	Addictive and challenging\n-	Plenty of achievements\n\nNegative:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	No trading cards\n\n9/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

That's 1992, my friends.\nI've never enjoyed one as much as this one.\n\nThis game is simple enough to play that you can jump right in and start playing. And if you want a casual experience, you can play this game like that. Don't think too much about your decisions, just pick what feels right. You can do that and have fun.\n\nOr, if you want a more analytical experience, you can take your time over each decision.\nYou can put your roster into a spreadsheet, plan out which players you will develop and which ones you will sell, and when.\nYou can crunch the numbers over the tactical decisions in the match. Do I take a shot from long range with my ACC 52 midfielder against his DEF 67 keeper, or is it better if I try a layoff pass through his center back to my forward, who can then try to score with a rainbow feint? You can do the math and figure out which one has a better chance at a goal--and also think about what position you leave the opponent with if you do not get a goal.\n\nIn other words, you can play this game hardcore, and try to make the best decisions all the time (even though many of the decisions will defy exhaustive analysis), or you can play by the seat of your pants, and try to win by instincts. It is a remarkable acheivement to have created a game that can satisfy both types of play styles.\n\nYou will like this game if you like:\nTurn-based tactics and strategy. (Even if you aren't a football fan, you will like this aspect, if you like turn-based squad tactics at all.)\nRoster management--balancing the need to win matches now with the need to develop your next generation of players.\nElegant game design--something simple to learn, but deceptively complex beneath the surface. Every decision that confronts you offers enough options to be interesting, but not so many to be overwhelming.\nThe challenge of taking the worst club in the lowest league and slowly building it into a continental champion.\nReplayability--start over with a new club and try a different strategy.\nReal club names and logos. It takes only a couple minutes to download the user mods with real names and logos for all of the clubs in all of the leagues. After all, isn't it more fun to take over West Bromwich Albion, with the throstle-on-a-hawthorn-branch logo, than some club named West Bromwich FC represented by a generic green eagle silhoutted atop a soccer ball?\nThings this game does not do:\nPretty graphics. If you want eye candy, look elsewhere.\n"Realistic" simulation. Players have four attributes, there are 10 different special abilities they can learn, and the pitch is a 10x7 grid. It certainly "feels" like football, but it is not a "realistic" simulation.\nComplex player relations. Players do their best, all the time, no matter what. You don't have to figure out how to motivate them, whom they like to play with, etc.\nPlayer contract negotiations. When you acquire a player he has a 1-year contract. When a contract is due to expire you can sign a new contract (1-3 years), let the player go, or sell him. The cost of the new contract depends on the footballer's level at the time of signing and the length of the contract. There's no negotiation.\nMedia interactions. No press conferences, interviews, etc.\nThe threat of getting sacked. It's your team. You make all the decisions, and you never lose your job.\nAs of the date of this writing (April 29 2016), the game still has the Early Access tag, but it is really a complete game.\nThe developers are adding additional features, but there isn't anything missing.","April 29","true","256.0"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

It is simple and elegant yet there is enough depth in the mechanics to provide good satisfication. I've only played the beta demo, just bought the full thing but I played a few seasons in that and the fundamental game mechanics were fun and I can only imagine it being better once I have access to greater amount of skills and management options that the full version allows. There is a real sense of progression and you find yourself invested in your team.\n\nEDIT\nOkay I now have 10+ hours under my belt. So I just want to update this. I can confirm that the greater variety of skills as your team progresses increases the depth of the game and I'm still only in Division 2  so I imagine as I unlock some more or get better players that this will continue to increase.\n\nAnd I stand by my impressions from the beta demo. This is a very clever game design. It's easy to understand mechanics and interface but there is still a good deal of strategy involved.\n\nNow it's still not perfect.\n\nAt the moment, the lowest two divisions are a push over but they have said they are going to update the game with a choice of weaker teams to start with for greater difficulty. It's good in a way because it gives you time to learn the game and it's far from overwhelming. You get hints and concise information game after game in your first season just so you learn the mechanics as you play. It's also not such a problem because the amauter league(lowest league) season is shorter than the higher divisions. That and you get more fame points (which you use to upgrade some aspects of your club) the more you win by so you are still interested in doing well even if the amaetur league doesn't really threaten to win the games.\n\nThe AI does the occassional silly thing but it's no where near enough to ruin the experience.\n\nFinally I had my first crash just recently but it was after 10+ hours of play and 3 seasons in so it seems very stable for early access.\n\nI could have talked in more details about why I think the game is so cleverly designed and why this is a gem but this is already going on to long and I just want to be upfront. It's definetely worth the price, even in early access.","June 2, 2015","true","22.8"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

When you manage your own team you can build your station, develop a coach squad, buy players, train players, etc. For transfers and stadion you use your money, for developing your squad you need your prestige points.\nMatches look very simple - you have two half times, with 24 possible actions in each. In every turn you can do 3 moves. What you can do depends from the situation, for example you can pass, control the ball, power shot, etc. Also your players get TP points after matches and level up when earned enough amount of this. Also some your players can have special skills.\nThe graphics in a game enough simple but looks nice. Sound also good.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+challenging and interesting\n+good manager system\n+Steam Workshop\n+steam achievements and trading cards\n- only single player mode - playing against other players would be interesting\n\nI think if you like a football you should try this game, as it looks very interesting and developers approached football in a different view. And I should say they done it well. This game now in EA, in a future there may be improvements -  multiplayer would be a good addition to the game, it could be really fun with friends.","January 16","true","13.5"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","22","32","0","0"

Do you like playing soccer games, like FIFA, but wish you could focus more on strategy rather than execution? If so, you'll probably enjoy this game. I love it! I wish it had more stat-tracking and history (e.g., career stats, hall of fame), but I think some of that will come in the future. As-is, it's a ton of fun, as long as you like your sports games heavier on strategy and light on graphics, action. When playing it, I feel like I'm playing a game of chess with my opponent. Moving players without the ball, luring defenders out of position, holding the ball and running out time. Except for the first league you start it, you won't win much by simply poundng the ball forward and shooting. You have to use trickery and deception to get your opponent to make a mistake and allow you a clear opportunity at goal. I recommend this game even in its early access form.

The very beginning of this game , is very simplistic, and it appears to me that by design, it starts to open up the deeper into the game you go. I honestly think what we have here is a very fun football game that is super simple to pick up and play. The skills your players possess, are easily forgotten to use and will be forgotten if you dont look up top to see what options are available to that player during the moving/shooting stage. The game does get tough, and i think it would take a long time to unlock /build up a team to being a powerhouse. But that in itself is the beauty of the game in a sense. Your team , once built to that power house, will feel like YOUR team. I really like this game. I think its one of the better time passers available on steam for the price. If i could add anything, maybe some career stats for your team, all time records etc....But in the end, i think its a job well done.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/375530/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI‚Äôm such a big fan of Sports Interactive‚Äòs Football Manager that when Creoteam approached me to cover their Football Tactics game rather than another game that I was hoping to feature developed by them that I was more than a little skeptical. Nothing is as in depth, serious and addictive in regards to football management games as good old FM. I‚Äôve played many hours in a number of other management games that attempt to push FM off of its porch but nothing has ever come close. I feared that Creoteam‚Äôs game was just going to end up being just another game that tried its best but fell woefully short. Thankfully I was quickly alleviated of my fears when I realized that that wasn‚Äôt what they were attempting to do at all. What their intention to create was a football management game that was much more accessible to all gamers ‚Äì not just football super fans ‚Äì as well as a game that was much more casual and nature and just an overall fun gaming experience.\n\nIn many ways Football Tactics reminded me of a few of the older shareware football management games that I played in my teenage years. These were games that were nowhere close to the uber tight management games that FM and Out of the Park Baseball are producing today but they were games that I vividly remember sinking tens or even hundreds of hours into.  For a gamer and a sports nut this game has the potential, and already is for its stage of early access, to be a lot of fun. You don‚Äôt need everything to uber serious all of the time so the game is going to fit a very nice niche.\n\nThe game plays out similarly to turn based combat games do on a grid with the obvious difference being that its football rather than an action-strategy game. Players have various different skills that are what you would expect from a football player with special skills such as shot cannon, lob passes, etc. giving the game some spice and flavor. Games are relatively quick affairs with some players feeling that they‚Äôre a little too short so perhaps an option to extend the game‚Äôs length ‚Äì which many sports titles currently allow ‚Äì perhaps being a nice option to appease them. I‚Äôd also like to see some more options within the game ‚Äì a few more moves added. However, I‚Äôve just been promoted out of the first league so more advanced techniques and skill may start becoming available as I progress during the game.\n\nI like the amount of options that have been developed outside of matches themselves. The full gamut of options for a football fan are present. You can play the transfer market ‚Äì buying better players and selling those that have been made redundant. You can also upgrade your club in a number of different ways. You can increase your seating capacity which will in turn increase the amount of money that you take at the gate. Improving your youth academy allows you to get better young footballers into the club. The first scout assistant decreases the age of players on the transfer list while the second scout assistant increases the number of players on the transfer list. Improving your major assistant enables substitutes to get experience after a match and finally positional coaches increase the amount of experience players get following matches.\n\nThe game is already heavily Steamified with 51 achievements giving hunters something to aim for and there are eleven trading cards to get to collect a full set. Steam Workshop integration has already been added to the game so that players can create mods, leagues and other things to improve the game. Finally, leagues can be played by both a single player or multi player to add a more competitive spirit to the game. In all, I‚Äôm very impressed with the amount of work that has already been completed on the game. The game is feature complete as Creoteam promise but they want to add even more features and tools to the game to make it the best game that it can possibly be and that makes me excited.\n\nAlthough it probably wont replace Football Manager as my go to football management game it is a game that I return to time and again to experience its casual, smart and very well designed and develop footballing experience. A great game.\n\nFor our epic giveaways and similar reviews head to http://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo join in our fantastic community join our Steam group","March 26","true","11.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","2"

I am in my third season, and have been promoted from League 4 to 3 to now to league 2.\n\nI fully expect to get creamed..as I have been taking most of the money I am making and upgrading my stadium. This will allow me, over time, to make even more money, and to be competitive at the higher leagues.\n\nThe tactics feel just about right. There are 24 "turns" per half, and you get three turns to either score, or be forced to give the ball up to the other team.\n\nThere are times when aggressive play and getting shots on goal are more preferred to try to hold onto the ball, or to dribble into the teeth of the defense. It all depends on your opposition, the score, the situation, or how bad you need to win! If you are ahead on aggregate 2-1, in the second leg of the FA Cup (or this games' equivalent), it may be better to play keepaway from the other team.\n\nAll things considered..I have a TON of new games, including some excellent AAA titles...and I am playing this one instead! Buy this game. Now. If you're reading this, then this means you are a football fan. If you're a football fan, then simply pull the trigger and buy this game. It looks cheesy and arcadey, but the developers really have a nice vision for this game, and the gameplay is excellent. Buy it.

(that is actually hardwired to f*** you over to no fault of your own if you get a winning streak)\n\nI friggin' LOVE THIS GAME. Sure, its iOS, sure its modern gaming developers, but it actually got working complexity hidden beneath its shell.\nOh, and ofcourse its actually more rewarding to play than any of the modern Football Manager iterations, which has lost all its gaming appeal. Why this is? Because the game will actually reward and show you that YOUR changes actually made a difference in the game.\n\nTurn based mechanics is the way to go for football managers, since Eidos/EA or whoever shitcompany is making that crap series doesn't realize that they are making a football manager GAME, not a football match simulator where every aspect of the gaming mechanics is hidden under the hood for nobody to ever see.\n\nPros:\n-Game expands its mechanics as you play, so it will never feel overwhelming for a new player\n-Rewarding skill progression on players\n-Surprisingly decent animations and overall aestethics\n-Has that "just one more turn" feeling which all good turn-based games need.\n\nCons:\n-Lack PC-gaming masterrace depth. (the 20+ years of headstart from the CM/Football Manager series when it comes to Transfer Market, Player Database, Stats, News, Random events, etc... Basically this game has all that CM/Football Manager does wrong right, and vice versa. Often to no fault of their own.)\n-Matches feel a bit "short" or like your managing a little league game.\n-Tactics might feel gimmicky if you are looking for realism.","October 13, 2015","true","93.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","0"

If you like football games, if you like tactical games, if you like games that take a cool new approach to stuff we know and love: buy it! You won't regret it! :)\n\nOh, and kids - don't forget to sometimes turn off the computer and play some real football outside ;).\n\n\nACTUAL REVIEW:\n\nThis game is really impressive. For the last two hours I experience a heavy case of "just... one... more... game...". Brilliant.\n\nFootball Tactics is fun. In a way that's the only review anyone needs. It's already pretty polished, and quite recently the devs added the options to not only edit names of your players, but also edit and create new Leagues, and publish them with the use of Steam Workshop. Which basically means I will soon publish my own version of Polish clubs :).\n\nThe idea of Football Tactics is super simple: manage your club, and play games in a turn-based mode. It's done in a way that is easy to understand and get a grasp on, but at the same time it is complex enough to engage the player.\n\nFor me - a football fan, and also a fan of football games - this one is a true gem. I can easily say that there are three football games I play: Football Manager, FIFA (on console) and Football Tactics. And yes - I feel safe mentioning Football Tactics together with those two huge titles. Because it gives me the same pleasure, although in a completely different, new way.\n\nFinally - I am VERY impressed by the developer. Amazingly responsive, very much engaged in the communication with the community (which you can also see below in the comments to my review :) ). My comment on strange names for Polish teams was instantly taken into account, and in following update the names were changed (with just some slight help from me, as I posted the changes in names, that I think should be done).\n\nI love gaming, and I do try many different games, and honestly - I rarely see so much dedication from the dev. It's simply great.\n\nFor me this game comes back to the times when the idea and playability were the most important factors. And even though it's "simple" - it's very entertaining, and looks really nice.\n\nI can really recommend it.","July 9, 2015","true","21.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","5"

ButIt's a really nice game to play also in beta. The matches are short and really addictive.  Like others mentioned it's not that deep so once you understand how the game works you tend to do the same thing over and over again. But thats not too much of a problem I think. Also I miss random events it would be great if you could get mail where you have to deciede on what to do . I played with an all new Team and in the beginning it was pretty easy to win but after 3-4 seasons it got harder and harder because of new divions and stronger opponents. You can't just play 4 seasons and expect to get promoted every time, The Transfer system is also quite good, you really have to choose if you should sell your best player for 2 good players or stick with your best player. What I don't like about the game is the prestige : You can't just buy new Managers for Money  but with prestige. And you only get prestige if you win a game and the more goals you score the more prestige you get. But thats hard especially when you just got promoted then you play your games tie most of the time and for a win with 1 goal difference you only get 1 prestige (Every Upgrade costs 30 Prestige and when you win the cup there is no gain in prestige) .

I'm not sure under what circumstances the first iteration of this game folded but I'm glad it's back and that the developers seem to be really trying to make it work this time around.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Take chess, take football, take a little from strategy games like Blood Bowl and that's what this game is. I've been trying to get into Blood Bowl for quite some time but I find it too obscure and complicated. This has potentially a very rich tactical depth but is at the same time super easy to understand and after a couple matches you'll realize what the best strategies are (once PvP is introduce that depth will turn into a black hole of infinite posibilities). Also, it's nice because it feels like a full fledged turn based experience but every match can be played in a very short amount of time.\n\nINTERFACE: It's super obvious this is a port from a tablet game, but the developer has said they'll eventually introduce widescreen support. Other than that, I'm not bothered at all by the app feel of the interface, it would be awesome if they launched on iOS again and you could continue your league play on the go.\n\nOTHER: In its previous model, this game had a pay mechanic to grant you access to the best players, I never entered the PvP scene because the app crashed all the time and it was super annoying so I didn't inverst into it but that mechanic has been removed (at least until version 0.2). Oh and apparently they are working on Workshop support to personalize the content even further.\n\nTo improve until final release:\n\n-Widescreen support\n-PvP as soon as possible\n-Certain minor bugs here and there (the developers seem active in correcting them though)\n\nMy wishlist:\n\n-Local hotseat support\n-The ability to play with selected teams already at the top\n-Multiple save slots\n\nTL;DR: If you like strategy games and you like football this game is the real deal. Best case scenario, you invest 13 bucks for a game that will eventually become a monster in strategy and sports gaming (the core gameplay certainly has the potential for that). Worst case scenario, the developers give up tomorrow and you invest 13 bucks in an amazing single player experience that even right now is very polished and very addicting.","July 24, 2015","true","7.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

At first I played all of the games, taking my beloved Liverpool FC out of the Amateur leagues and into the first division. But then I realised that I didn't need to grind all of those games, I could simulate my way into the Premier League and beyond. I've found that the positioning isn't greatly important, but the skills definitely are. I just completed yet another season (2041/42!) where I finally won the treble: Premier League, Domestic Cup and Champions League. The only games I actually played were the two finals, and it isn't hard when you have Level 100 Attackers with 170+ Attack skill. This is a great little game that I've gotten a lot of enjoyment out of (23 hours and counting). One thing that is ridiculously imbalanced though is the way that you can pay 200 fame to buy your footballer until age 40 or 41.

The games move by quickly though, so maybe a setting to add a few more rounds to the half would be nice.  The transfer market is good, and the weight between "should I keep my highly skilled vet" or "sell him to land a young wonder-kid" is spot-on.  I've played long enough to get my Amatuer side to the PL, and every season I find myself struggling with these choices.  It is a very simple system, but I have yet to crack the code on building a solid roster of wiley vets and up-and-comers.  My only knock would be some better documentation on pulling off the numerous skill moves.  It took me many seasons to get to where I could routinely pull-off 4 moves per round, but on the offensive side, the moves rarely pay off.  I made a lot of mistakes in building my roster though, so maybe I will start a new save.  One other added feature might be to be able to drop below 11 players on the roster to be able to sell off 2 players to get one higher quality one.  Overall though, a great time-killing game that could be perfect with just a few tweaks.  It's like a stream-lined cross between Civ V and Football Mgr.  This ia highly enjoyable alternate to those time consuming games.","December 8, 2015","true","564.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I mean I'll follow the world cup highlights, but that's about as far as I go. As far as gaming goes, I last seriously played Footbal Manager on Commodore 64, as later PC versions turned out just too tedious for me.\n\nBut then I came across this. And *boom*, I love football again. Well done Creoteam, really well done. Why is it so good? Because it is simple, yet deep. Easy to grasp, but will take cunning and skill to master.\n\nFirst I spent an hour deciding on my club's name, fiddling with the colours and jerseys, then it plunges you straight into the competition. Only a few tabs, like the team roster with the basic pitch layout and who you want to play where, the training menu with just a couple options for each player, the buying/selling transfers one, the upgrade one and the league table and calendar. Nothing to get lost in, easy to keep all your players in mind and how to best use them in a game.\n\nAnd the game? A brilliantly simple concept.  3 actions per turn when you can try to take the ball from the other team, pass it, dribble or shoot. The skill of your player vs. the skill of the opposing player will determine if you will be successful. But whenever you score a goal, you're genuinely happy, because you executed a tactic perfectly.\n\nEven at version 0.2 the game is perfectly playable, the looks and animations are excellent for a simple-graphics game, you'll probably want to turn off the repetitive music after a half an hour, but otherwise it's great fun.","June 23, 2015","true","92.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The game starts you off at the bottom league in the chosen country, you have to put up a formation, perhaps buy a few new players and learn the controls.\n\nWhile luck is definately a huge factor dont forget that each player has individual skills which can be trained as the player levels up, this adds to depth in terms of which options you have on the pitch. A match takes about 3-4 minutes to complete and time just flies away as you need to play just one more game.\n\nIts easy to play and far less complicated than chess, in fact its the light aspect of it which perhaps is the games biggest advantage, everyone can pick it up and have a go. As for the price, given the hours I have use I cant complain.\n\nThe devs seem responsive and the beta has many new implementations which improve the game, youth academy, other ways of gaining fame (game currency for certain upgrades). Up to you to give the current release a go or try the beta.\n\nWith much room for improvements and balance I still think this is a little gem, if you are a football fan you might love it.","August 11, 2015","true","160.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You will be informed and entertained!\n\nFirst of all:\n\nWow! Definetly worth the Price for this Early Access (!) Game, if you¬¥re into Soccer Management and tactical Gameplay and want to see a well rounded Game for the asked Price!\n\nThe Game:\n\nThis Games Base is solid and working, both performance and mechanic-wise. I fell in love with what this Game is already and even more so with what this Game can definetly be in the Future.\n\nFootball Tactics has, as i mentioned before, a good working and fun to play mechanic for the Games and the right Options on what to extend your Club on the management Side. There are real Choices to make, depending on your Play-Style, that make a Difference:\n\nNeed stronger Defense to hold the stronger League you got promoted to? You can do that!\nWant even more dangerous Strikers to aim for the Title? You can do that!\n\nThis Game is so solid Gameplay and Fun-wise, that i have to admit i feel flattered to see a Game that doesn¬¥t claim to be or tries to be more than it is.\n\nIt¬¥s fun. It¬¥s engaging to see your Club develop. And you feel the Difference of stronger enemy Teams and Teams that you are supposed to win against.\n\nThere is always a Chance to get behind when playing a supposedly weaker Enemy and always a minimal Chance to get a good Result against the overwhelming odds of a higher Class Opposition, if you have the right Idea and a bit of Luck. It¬¥s Soccer after all.\n\nAll this without losing the importance of your Team Tactic and your Formation. In my first Season i made it to the second Round of the League Cup against all Odds, because i played with a 6-Man Defense and just tried to have as much Ball Posession as possbile. It was a boring 0-0 and i won in the Penalty Shootout. I¬¥m not a big Fan of this Tactic, but i won and got a big Load of Prestige, Experience and Money to invest into my Infrastrcture and my personal favorite: My Youth Team.\n\nSo what are the Cons and what needs to be implemented to reach the maximal Potantial of this Game?\n\nCons:\n\nAs i mentioned: The game works perfectly and has a very solid and working Base + Fun-Experience, so it doesn¬¥t need any Fixes. Which bring me to the "real" Cons of this Game, which is Content and Multiplayer.\n\nImplementations (Cons 2):\n\nThis Game needs Multiplayer! It just does! It¬¥s a shame to keep this Experience from the Multiplaying-Community! We Football/Soccer-Fanatics NEED to be able to measure our Skill against other non AI Opponents. Make it happen! It¬¥ll eventually make this Game way bigger than it is atm! Seriously!\n\nMy Second Complaint is, that there isn¬¥t more of this Game. With this solid and well developed Gameplay-Base there just needs to be more Content.\n\nExamples:\n\nMore active Skills for the Players than the few we have, even when this few are very nicely done. Also make the Skill a little deeper and not just dependend on Player Skill or his Stamina. Make (mainly for Multiplayer Reasons) Rock-Paper-Scissors like Skills, like a certain Striker Dribble-Skill is weak to certain defensive Skill, which will result in +50% Bonus on the Defenders Throw. That would make it a real mind Game on what to choose in a Situation for the Players and it would even influence tactical Choices, like in reality where a certain Player who normally isn¬¥t in the Starting Team gets thrown in, because he¬¥s good against a certain Player from the Enemy Team. Also, implement more Passive Skills, maybe to make certain Players able to move even 3 Fields in 1-Turn. That way you would get so much more tactical Variations and each Team would really have a unique Face and Style.\n\nIn Short:\n\n- Make Multiplayer happen\n- More Content: More Active Skills, More Passive Skills, Deeper mechanics for SOME (!) of them\n\nIf you make this happen, this Game could really achieve more than anyone would think. At the Moment it¬¥s a good Game for a fair Price.\n\nIt can be more though.\n\nHave a nice Day to everyone who managed to read this to the End :D","December 23, 2015","true","63.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

But, if you're looking for Blood Bowl Soccer without the blood, you're going to be disappointed. This just doesn't have that level of complexity, at least not yet. Maybe with some tweaking and fixing, this could be solid. As is, you only have three moves to make per turn, and you're supposed to be able to get more by executing skills, but rarely does this work, and there's really no explanation why. It basically ends being a matter of which team has better stats. The team with the better players can score easily with no real tactics, and the weaker team has few tools availble to stop them, or even slow them down.\nI'd like to recommend this game, and spent a fair amount of time playing it, but it's just not real good, yet....","December 21, 2015","false","18.9"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","0"

I was treated to something greater than my expectations. Football tactics is a well-crafted and fun game.

There‚Äôs even an option to watch the AI make decisions for you. I can also make my own teams and use others made by the lovely people on workshop. I can also train my squad members to have new skills such as the tactical slide tackle or the powerful cannon shot. This game is the Wow Butter of steam, "Wow! I can't believe it's not a flash game!" I mean, Steam doesn't sell flash games... Right? Anyways back on track. I love being able to create my own club and form it in my decisions, the best part about football is when the Acorn Boy's representing Denmark murder London FC in a death match in my backyard. I mean, the checkered flag with a blue chicken on it raised from a deflated soccer ball made news headlines! I also love the fact that this game has weather. Weather in this game can affect your play through a lot. Rain decreases some stats for your players but gives a tactical advantage to you, as it affects the opposing team as well. Something that I don't like about the game is it's really hard to get money, ESPECIALLY in the beginning. This just frustrated me a bit and wasn't much of a problem. There was also some bugs that needed to be ironed out. For example whenever I open the club news or coach notes it goes on a spasm and keeps on flashing.

At its core this is supposed to be a turn based strategy game, yet it also tries to be as casual as possible. The movement is limited by the small pitch size and the relatively small choice of actions means that you'll be doing the same things over and over again. Since the game is heavily reliant on RNG you will usually have to play the numbers to have a shot at a consistently succesful season, which further limits your influence on the proceedings. Your players will, for large parts of the game, have only one skill and most situations are dictated by a singular attribute, so your decisions usually get simplified even further.\nProgress mostly comes from player stats, which give the game an RPG~ish touch, yet also seem to be mostly random. You can buy and sell players, but due to the way finances are set up you'll want to grow your own, which mostly means getting decent young players and leveling them up. Upon level up the player gets a semi random set of stat upgrades. Level ups come quite regularly but are usually pretty meager on their own (+1 to your primary stat seems to be the average), which means building up a team to take on the best opposition is a lengthy undertaking.\n\nOn the plus side these may be things some players look for. There's minimal input on your end and yet, through unnecessarily grindy upgrades, there's some sense of progress (which you will attribute to your skill, even though you know better). I've put quite a few hours into the game while watching Netflix on my primary screen and I have to admit it's a great fit for that. The UI/graphics are simple yet pleasant and while the audio is laughable it's fortunately entirely irrelevant. It isn't punishing at all, there is no fail state and it will reward you just for being there, which I personally fail to appreciate but can still potentially see other people enjoying.\n\nMaybe I went in expecting the wrong thing. I read the name as if there was an emphasis on tactics, I thought of great games like Frozen Cortex or even Blood Bowl and while I never expected the game to have that kind of quality, this was stilll a huge let-down. I spent more than ten hours with it hoping for the game to improve towards the late game, but its inherently simple design stops it from ever becoming more than a casual side activity. I'd expect this kind of game to be on a mobile platform for around five bucks and I'd recommend it to the crowd that goes for those. For people looking for anything more than a time-killer I'd suggest staying away.","January 6","false","13.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","3"

The goal, pun intended, is to move your club into the premier league of your nation to compete for the top championship. It will appeal to players who are fans of football and players whose time is limited to 30 minute play sessions. That‚Äôs about all the time you need to set your line, make a few improvements to your club, and play a match or two in Football Tactics.\n\nCompared to other football management sims, this game is simpler. For example, the footballers who populate your club‚Äôs lines have only four rated skills:  accuracy for shooting goals, passing to other teammates, defense for taking the ball from your opponents, and control for mainlining possession during an opponent‚Äôs defensive action. However, these four skills, tactics cards, tactics formations, and your players‚Äô age and energy level create on field challenges that are deeper than expected.\n\nThe matches are turn-based with each team alternating through 3 actions per side for a set number of actions per half. During one cycle you might have a mid-fielder pass to a forward, the forward dribble to get  a better shot angle, and then the forward make a precision shot on goal. Of course, the opposing team will try to counter your moves each step of the way.\n\nOff the field, club mangers can shop the transfer market, direct player training and development, and oversee expansion of the team‚Äôs fan base, coaching staff, and facility upgrades. The business model is easy to understand. The better players perform on the field the higher their price and trade value rises.  Put together a string of victories and your club‚Äôs fan base will grow helping you earn more from ticket sales for home games. In addition to money, your team will also earn prestige points that you can spend on team management decisions.\n\nFootball Tactics includes stock leagues from around the world in addition to a growing number of national and international leagues that users are adding on Steam Workshop. If you don‚Äôt like your club‚Äôs name, kit, or logo, then you‚Äôre free to modify them in the in-game editor. Also, you can edit the names of team members, too.\n","January 4","true","15.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Yet, for ludophiles and enthusiasts, little remains other than to play "Football manager," the lacklustre manager-mode in any reflex-based title, or simply have a go at some 2-bit "Fantasy Football" league somewhere in the dusty corners of the net.\n\nBut lo-and-behold, when choices seem as meagre as empty mist-wrapped stands, when a hot soup-flask is not enough to warm your cockles, Creoteam come to the rescue with a more than interesting, even palatable, offer. "Football Tactics" is born, underrated hidden gem like Matthew Le Tissier, seemingly casual, at times unexpectedly difficult, always overwhelmingly addictive.\n\n"Football Tactics" is worthy of attention, and not only for fans of the game. The game plays out with familiar turn-based mechanics, a system encompassing rules seen in well known titles like Civilisation, X-Com or the recent Wastelands 2, but also adding some specials seen in systems employing the "Active Time Battle" combat. Yes, those are JRPGs more often than not, and this game makes use of abilities and talents in a similar manner.\n\nThe all-too-familiar compulsion mechanics are there; win games, gain XP, level your footballers. Train one of four stats (Accuracy, Passing, Defense, Control) and mould the style of play which suits you. Play the Guardiola game by controlling the football with high "Control" and "Passing" stats. Or simply hoof the ball upfront with the "Long Pass" skill, and hope your lanky centre forward latches onto it. Want to keep possession? You can "fortify" your striker in the same way you fortify units in Civ, getting a "Control" bonus. Want to dribble past the whole back-four, like Diego did against Belgium? Use "Raibow feint," one of the talents gained by levelling up your footballers.\n\nGranted there is still room for improvement here, like additional modes and a beefier, more-complex ruleset. As it stands, the game is breakable simply by upgrading your youth coach, waiting out promotion, farming XP, and building an all-star team which will waltz through the first two or three leagues, like a vintage Omar Sivori. But improvements are being made, and it really does look promising.\n\nOverall, amply recommended; among the big rubbish pile that is Early Access, there is a sparkle which gives us hope.","January 11","true","30.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So far, the gameplay is fun but lacks in depth for a strategy title. I would normally give a positive review for this game in early access, but I want to counter balance the very positive reviews it has so far, since I believe this game to be worth 80% positive votes instead of 94% (at time of this writing) with its current "depth". It does the job well as a soccer team simulation, my review focuses more on the "strategy" aspect of its categorization. If you like simulating games and managing a team, then I would bet this game is perfect for you. If you like levelling up your goons and playing deeply strategic games, especially turn based ones then keep reading.\n\nI enjoy playing it casually so far and after 7 hours I can say the difficulty curve increases with advancement. But not in a "strategies become more important" kind of way. It's all about my forward's accuracy vs the defenders defense. Wish me luck ! To be honest, I still have to fully realize the depth of strategical option, since I did about 4 seasons (with 3 different teams), so I haven't tried all the skills yet ... but right now I can only say, strategy in this game is very streamlined and the one best option is easy to identify with no reason I would stop spamming it in hopes of getting more goals. Basically, there's no real "setting up for the goal" since it comes down to getting the ball to the forward, get him as close as possible to the goal and shoot: from there, it's a skill throw for the shot and it's always boiled down to probabilities. I can score through 3 defenders on the other team if they are amateurs ... or it is impossible to score in season 2 against 3rd league teams until I have taken enough losses that my players have leveled up (which isn't the problem for me but a reality in this game).\n\nBy changing a few mecanics, this title could become a very, very good turn based strategy title with light RPGs elements. But then it would become a lot more time consuming I guess, since they would have to give more actions, make actions harder, passes shorter, having other adjacent allies provide support automatically while having adjacent opposing players provide pressure automatically making actions harder, provide appropirate skills for all new concepts, etc. which would make games longer through the system AND mking you think about each move, to set the best probabilities for your actions.\n\nConclusion: a negative review due to lack of depth in actual match gameplay. A good simulation title. Will play it casually and adjust review to a positive one if more depth is added to playing the game vs simulating it and making it more about team development.","April 24","false","7.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Confusing design decisions caused this title to suffer an identiy crisis deciding if it was going to be a casual or hardcore. Worse still the developers failed to circumvent some of the pitfalls that come with combining so many concepts together.\n\nEven More Skinny: This game feels alot like a very polished mobile phone freemium game without the microtransactions.\n\nI do of course approve of the developers excluding the microtransactions and the care they have taken in refining their product to be presented in a a concise and easy-to-use package.\n\nThe Longer View:\n\nTough game to pin down and fit into a Box but I will give it a shot...\n\nI would say this game is a Sports Simulation first and then a Strategy game consisting of some Turn-based RPG elements with a strong Tactical component. Conceptually it seems like an excellent foundation from which you could start building a very unique and deep game but I did not find there to be much complexity to any of the mechanics that were built on top of that great foundation. To me the concept of the game suggests and hints that this is going to be a hardcore crowd pleaser. However, from a presentation standpoint the UI, graphic design, and simplistic text descriptions of events/outcomes/etc. are all much more in line with a casual gaming experience usually found on a mobile phone or facebook game.  I can honestly say that I enjoy both casual phone games (the higher quality ones at least) and hardcore pc games. I will also say that all of the genre's I mentioned earlier are favorites of mine. but I feel that this game comes up short in the areas that usually make each of those genres fun and appealing.\n\n\nI Liked:\n\nUnique Concept\nPlayer agency in chosing between a few different methods to build your squad\nTactics (I personally am going to buy your game if this is in the title and the screenshots/playthroughs/video is anything short of atrocious)\nRPG Elements blended with the Sports Simulator\nUI and controls are streamlined perfectly (really well done)\nNo Microtransactions\n\nAC/DC:\n\nPredomintly a Casual Game\nMedium-to-High RNG elements\nGrindy\nSound Effects/Music - I would say this aspect was OK but also somewhat sparse and repetitive (I play most sim games listening to a soundtrack of my own choosing anyway)\n\nBut awwwwww C'mon:\n\n4 attributes are just not enough.....unless you have an excellent system of Special Abilites to compliment them...\nSpecial Abilities are a bit vanilla and many of the defensive ones pointless\nNo real storyline feel and very limited options for customizations to "create your own"\nSmall size of the playing field grid limits options\nVery Limited Defensive Options\nFeels like a Hardcore Gaming Input is required b/c....\nProgression is slow and incrimental\nDifficutly/Balancing Staggered Resulting in Long Periods of cruising followed by getting your face crushed once you've hit a (non-pay) wall\nJuxtaposition of the two points immediately above this one\n\nThat last point was the real fun killer for me. Football Tactics fails in this regard by setting itself up with a freemium game structure in that you are either struggling to progress because you have not inserted enough currency (in this case time spent grinding) or blowing the competition out of the water because you have. The tactical aspects of games will occasionally allow for you to beat a superior opponent and it is at the moment Football Tactics shines brightest. This too comes with a pitfall unfortunately because of the limited amount of diversity offered in your player builds and to a lesser degree limited number of spaces and therefore movement on the field. The result is that there are a limited number of choices to your strategies and many of them will come down to attempting a similiar set of actions that rely more on maximizing your best chance at a good roll (RNG haters beware) than careful planning. I really felt like I was being punished by the game for succeeding with these tactics early on as it caused my squad to advance up the divisions twice in concurent seasons and left my underfunded squad facing more difficult odds (literally rng odds not tactical difficulties)\nthan any tactical approach would be able to sufficiently overcome.\n\nTwo comparision points I would like to bring up are the statistical heavy Football Manager Series and Tactical Aspects of Blood Bowl.  In a way I feel like Football Tactics is alot like playing a toned down version of the Football Manager series when your simulating games managing your squad, improving through the transfer windows, or youth player discoveries or in-squad development. The depth of the systems for Football Manager is really what makes it a game worth playing in the first place and again the lack of options present in Football Tactics prevents it from succeeding in the same way. As a Tactical Game Blood Bowl succeeds in the importance of placing your units in the correct spot is crucial because you are making a choice of influencing some control over a large amount of space (by spreading your characters out) or influencing a greater amount of control over a smaller area (keeping your units closer together). Football Tactics gives your units VERY limited influence over space and gives you a very limited field with which to work. When your opponent has the ball most of your units can only influence the space they occupy by being giving a chance to steal the ball if your opponent chooses to challenge that space by dribbling through it or passing almost directly through it. Most of the time this will not factor in as your opponent will choose to forgoe any chance of an interception by making a very safe pass (when a more direct approach is necessary in terms of scoreline/time managment) or simply dribbling past your player. Defenders have the ability to influence shots that cross the spot next to them which is a good start but why do they allow the ball carrier to dribble into that same space without interference? It just does not work for me to have a game labeled as TACTICS and have such a limited number of tactical options.\n\nCasual FM with a Turn-based Tactics similiar to Blood Bowl sounded like a sure-fire winning column title in my book but the pace of progression/balancing aspects and strange design choices really drag this one down in the mud. This is still early access stage so things could improve but baring some momnumental shift in the game design and direction I can not see my opinion changing at this point. Would love to be proved wrong here btw. I am really hoping to see a sequel/reboot/clone that adds depth pop up and deliver on the substantial amount of promise I see unfufilled here. Points for UI streamlining and original concept though....\n\n3.5/10","January 3","false","9.3"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","6","14","2","0"

It's a fun little game that can be great when your tactics make a difference, but too often there is very little you can do to impact the outcome of a game.  Too often the team with the highest numbers wins.  Worse still, a team with a single incredibly good striker or goalkeeper can essentially prevent you from winning if their randomly generated stats are high enough.  Skills have some use, but from what I've seen, they tend to be more situational than part of an overarching style. The game could be good with a few more improvements.\n\nMy Feedback:\n\n-Let us start in any league we want.  What's the point of having a Champions League stand in if we always have to start in the 5th division?  Since the game has no microtransactions, why make content so hard to get to?  Some people won't want to level grind all the way to the top.\n\n-Let us pick which abilities our footballers develop.  I really like the layoff pass and rainbow feint abilities, yet who can get these abilities is left up to chance since you have to buy a player before you can devlop an ability.  Players that come with skills seem to be far above my budget.\n\n-Make power shot more viable.  I've seen the difference between power and finesse be 20 points apart for the keeper.  Getting corners is the advantage of the power shot, but it's really hard to weigh the chance of of a richochet against the higher probability of scoring off of a precision shot.  Right now it's now much of a value proposition.\n\n-Continuing off the last point, maybe show us a percentage of a pass or shot working?  How bad is a 20 againt 35? Like it could work, but it's unlikely or more of a pray to the RNG gods type choice? Strategy games are supposed to be about trade offs, but it's often hard to understand some of the x2 moves against one dice roll.\n\n-Revamp the match sim engine.  Right now the same teams keep yo-yoing between divisions.  The teams at the top absolutely clobber the teams at the bottom.  I shouldn't have to have a near perfect record to get promoted.  Especially when a game like this is heavily based on chance.\n\nI wish steam had a neutral button for games like this.  It's not a bad game at all, but I would be hard pressed to recommend it.","May 2","false","14.8"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

With a mod you can even get the real names and logos. The game is fun in a sort of "mindless" way and the games go by quickly so it can be addicting to just keep playing one more over and over.\n\nNow I have to list the negetives. THIS IS STILL WHEN IT'S IN EARLY ACCESS:\n\n1. MY overall experience so far is that the RNG is missing the "random" part. There have been way too many times where I'll have a range of 1-50 and the CPU will have a range of 1-9 and I end up with 8 and CPU gets 9. The RNG is tipped so much in favor of the CPU that I rarely ever try to cause these. Whenever I'm on offense I play it safe and do short passes through open space. This can easily be fixed throughout the Early Access so this might change.\n\n2. As great as it is to see the team I follow in MLS in this game, I wish the players that were on the team in real life were in this game. I completely understand that this game doesn't have the license from MLS but they could still put similar names and similar attributes to the players. Small issue in the end but it'd be a nice addition.\n\n3. The game gives you three turns to move but I rarely find that it's enough. Occasionally you'll get lucky and the stars will allign or the CPU does something dumb and turns the ball over at midfield but most of the time they'll bring the ball to your box, miss and then youll spend three turns passing it up tp your forward when your turn ends. I understand that this could be to emulate how soccer games can be: two teams running the ball back and forth but the way it is now makes the game feel choppy instead of realistic. I think the best way to handle this since soccer is a game that's very much about movement is to borrow the turn based mode from XCOM: EU and have two actions per "turn" for the three players you choose. For example, using a through ball isn't possible unless your player has a certain trait learned which can take up to a full season to learn and it can only be used once a game. If the XCOM turn based mode was introduced you could have one guy run ad midfield and pass while  a striker ran to meet the ball and one time it at goal.\n\n\nThe RNG really kills it for me bcause I haven't experience some of the one on one combat due to the high chance that my team will lose and concede a goal.\n\nAs it stands, I can't reccommend the game right now. It feels like the goal was to make a simpler Football Manager 16 while also being more nuanced than the FIFA 16 Manager mode but IMO the game is an acrade game that relies too much on chance. I hope some of my issues are fixed because this has the potential to suck days of my life if I feel like my preperation of my team has an effect on the one on one duals.","January 23","false","5.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","6"

There's no real tactics/strategy, it's all based on luck, and the 3-turn-per-round-rule doesn't allow for anything fancy at all. Plus, as every action takes up minutes, you arithmetically can't win higher than like 3-0, maybe 4-0 if you are really lucky. No real surprises in the game, and nothing that would make you log back in again. - While I gladly gave my $15 for the nice idea and maybe something better in the future, I really can't recommend this game at all to anybody else.\n\n[Edit:] I appreciate the developers answering negative feedbacks/recommendations. While I played the game a tiny bit longer now, I still feel that (a) match times are not long enough, and (b) actions always seem to consume the same amount if game time - I think the game would benefit highly from making actions using up time in certain ranges, aka 1-5 minutes, this would also give some games the feeling of lasting "forever" and others to be rather short - just like in real ilfe. :) - Anyways, for the polite and professional answer I change my recommendation, although I personally do not think this will be my next "big love".

The unlocked moves and upgrading coaches and facilities is very shallow. The interface is clearly meant for mobile devices. This would be a great game if it was free to play, but there wouldn't be enough unlockables to even warrant microtransactions. Without an almost ground up overhaul of the interface, I don't see myself enjoying the game.\n\nEdit: Apparently the first bit is meant as a tutorial.

The jump in competition between Amateur league and the next one up is a little rediculous. I'm not sure if I'm missing something with training my players or earning money to get better players, but after amateurs Ijust lose every game. The opposing players have double of the main position stats. It's just not fun.\n\nThe game would be a whole lot funner if you could chose what league you're in year to year. Instead it's just "You did good in this league, here's the next one, go lose a lot". It's a casual game. Let it be casual.\n\nIf you like games with a really depressing grind, give it a go I guess.

Feel like the build up of Loyalty points is a little slow and the mechanism for acummulating them encourages exploitative gameplay rather than trying out different tactics.

Pleasing graphics and sound with some surprising depth - only a few gripes: the jump from Amateur League to Division 3 was HUGE, every team had a better Defender, Midfeld player AND Forward than I could put out so not losing was a real struggle. Opponents gained a bonus "move action" when a player succesfully completed a Skill, I do not. My beginning team were ALL 28 years old (or older) ... this makes for a difficult third and fouth season.\n\nHowever, if you want a very playable game with a surprising amount of depth that has a very shallow learning curve, this is for you. Sadly, Fulchester United may not get beyond the Third Division for quite a few more years, I guess just like another manager, I'm not so special after all.","December 19, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really enjoy the aesthetics, the system and the advancement rate.\n\nThe game could definitely do better with a bit more depth: maybe recording all statistics for players regardless of their position, or allowing to change their roles (DF into MF, for example). I would really love to be able to review my club's historical players and data.\n\nWhat I think could really improve the game, is reducing the RNG's weight, especially for the use of skills/special techniques, which completely ignore the relative level of the players involved.\n\nOverall, I liked the game but it needs a lot more work, and I think it's headed in the right direction.

However, the part that swayed me is an optional setting, so please note that the default game still seems too random. So long as you go into it with reasonable expectations, Football Tactics can be quite charming.\n\nFor one thing, it features slick design and UI. Information is easily accessible with a few clicks, and managing positions and rosters is straightforward.  This ties into the streamlined managerial experience. People who want a lot of number crunching and projections can play Football Manager.  This game is more arcade-like, with a simplified simulation.  You still get the whole experience (signing, training, budgeting, seasons, tournaments, etc.), but it's bite-sized.\n\nThe matches play in a similar fashion to blitzball in Final Fantasy X: players have four stats that determine their passing, shooting, defensive, and positional abilities.  There are also "skills" that allow them to make harder shots, longer passes, etc. It is turn based, and each game consists of 48 actions taken in threes.  Success is determined by rolling one's players stat versus the opposition's stat.  For example, a player with a Pass rating of 24 is attempting to pass through an opponent with a Defense stat of 12.  Both players generate a random number from 1 to x, where x is their stat; the higher number prevails (ties go to the active team).\n\nIn the default settings, the RNG has too much variability for my taste, and they can significantly reduce the effectiveness of your tactics.  Some games devolve into a matter of who rolls better, you or the computer.  Training players takes a lot of time, and acquiring better players is expensive.  Tournaments happen each year, and if you get to enter, you will likely be facing teams from much higher leagues.  Their stats will be significantly higher than yours, and you will only be able to hope for a tie.\n\nThere is a new, optional setting when creating a new game that gives players a skill floor of 30% of their rating.  This means that high-skilled players can more consistently outclass weaker opponents, although they can still be beaten.  Although I would prefer that this setting be integrated into the core game, its presence makes it easier to execute tactics consistently rather than gambling on a lucky roll.","December 16, 2015","true","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No? Would you have liked it if it were... better?\n\nIf so, Football Tactics may just be the game for you. It's a super addictive management sim that's leagues simpler than Football Manager.\n\nGrain of salt warning: At the time of this review, Football Tactics is an early access game, so stuff's still being balanced.\n\nPros:\n-The unique player abilities definitely add a bit of spice to the RNG.\n-The interface is super clean and easy to read\n-Actual matches are fun. I also enjoy the AI mode for when I get burned out and want to play while I'm doing something else. It's nice that you can take control if you think your AI are being stupid, too.\n-I like the versatility of being able to use players in non-native positions, like using a Defender as a Midfielder. It really allows you to mix up your team and tactics.\n-Hot Seat multiplayer?! I don't think I'll ever get a chance to use it, but I'm pretty excited about it anyway.\n-Like a billion real countires and teams to pick from. You can also customize your club's logo and uniforms.\n\nCons:\n-The difficulty curve is a little wacky. You start out in the noobie league, so it's understandably easy. If you do some smart team management, the next league is ok too. Once you hit Second League, you're likely to have a 1.5-star team regularly going up against 2-3 star teams, both in the tournament and the cup. When you tie or lose, your players get fewer XP. Fewer XP means you don't level as quickly. Not leveling means you're grinding in autopilot way longer than you need to be. To my knowledge, there's no way to move backward to lower leagues to train your players. As it is, It kind of feels like an intentinal time sink.\n-Addendum: As you move to higher leagues, you get more XP for losing, but your players have time limits on their careers. You can get starting players as young as 16 or 17, but they retire at 35-40.\n-CORNER KICKS. I don't know if it's the load time as players get into position, or having to manually move each defender for coverage, or the fact that high-powered teams have a habit of getting 3-5 of them in a row, even with my roided out goalie. Corner kicks are my #1 motivator to spectate matches.\n-Also, it'd be cool to swap BACK to spectator mode after taking control. Sometimes I only want to play Offense, or to avoid a Corner Kick or whatever.\n\nBut really, this game is super fun. Also, it's cheap, and worth sinking a good 5-10 hours into, at least.","January 23","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Football Tactics is different, not as intense or xl orientated. However, this is where it hangs....I don't know how long the interest level will be there. It looks and plays like a tablet orientated game....it could be deeper...it is in early access, I haven't read the road map tbh. So what does it give.... 1. The price - Well worth the money in the current state...think of it as a couple of bottles of wine...this certainly competes with the interest level...and I don't think I will have a headache tomorrow. 2. Concept - It is a different view on sports management. 3. Fun - Yes I am actually cheering on my eric cantona when he passes to keegan...who then rainbow feints for his hat trick.... 4. Progression - Yes your stars can gain match winning talents with training.\n\nHowever...........tactics are slim...and it becomes a game of draughts rather than football, rainbow feinting a goal keeper is good ONCE....twice or thrice is a bit of 'win button'. The graphics are not amazing, but then again I didn't expect or want them to be...but maybe a strategic decision has to be made by the Devs...Do you wanna have the pro ev character builder or go the evil genius fun cartoon style..I personally would advise you to go for the latter. I have only just begun the path of glory and yes, I can imagine that the games can get harder in the top leagues...but the number of turns is sometimes frustrating for armchair tacticians....wider pitch(i.e more squares) or more turns per half..(maybe ther eis a setting I havent looked yet...). Summary is it's fun, it's early access, and it's WaB....However, genre creator is not there yet...still some immersion and customisation perks are needed. Little 7/10...which is not bad for a start.","January 23","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is simple yet well done Football Manager that lets you be in charge of tactical solutions on the field. It fills the gap in football simulators for the lovers of tactics like me. PES and FIFA offer just simple tactical solutions since they let you control merely one player properly. Football Managers focus just on strategy and let the tactics entirely on AI. In Football Tactics (FT) YOU perform ALL the tactics in turn based manner.\n\nSo just because this game focuses on actual tactics I love it :D now for the cons. FT is not too realistic and the tactics are often gimmicky. Next thing is that FT rather simple in design - both in the manager options and in the gameplay options. It could be better in the variety department but it is surely complex enough to enjoy the game.\n\n8/10 Possibly the best simulator of football tactics.","December 21, 2015","true","64.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I had played FIFA in the past I had always wanted for a game to be released where you can slow things down and really give a tactical look at the progression of the game.  Sometimes you are going to want to spread the defense out and attack out wide and sometimes you might just want to overload players into the attack, it all depends on how the other taem is lined up.  It is great being able to upgrade a club in all aspects from training staff to stadium upgrades.

It combines a bit of strategy, choices and dice rolls with all things football related, like transfers, skills and training (all streamlined, don't expect Football Manager here) into one addictive game. It is easy to learn how to play (the game explains the basics to you very clearly), but not so easy to fully master this, that only comes with (a lot of) practice. Very user-frendly, and while it isn't that great to look at, graphics here aren't exactly anywhere near the top of this game's priorities list, nor should it. But this is just so beautifully put together, even the weather is a game-changer, literally, as playing in the rain afects your players (and opponents too) in a diferent way that playing in a very hot day.

Alot of clubs seem to have a variation of the Arsenal logo, which I'm not sure if it was intentional or not, just something I noticed.\n\nThe one major downside comes with the aforementioned RPG elements. There doesn't seem to be any set rules in regards to the statistics, and how they determine the success of a particular action. The dice rolls are WAY too random, which I imagine is to simulate the randomness of real life football, but when your striker with almost 100 accuracy gets his shot blocked by a defender with 20 defense becasue his stat randomly plummets to 5 there's something inherently wrong.\n\nTo summarize, great idea, but the dice rolls are frustratingly random which makes it feel more like a luck simulator than a football game. Still can't stop playing so the devs must have done something right.\n\nAlso, no Bohemians for Irish league, whats up with that?\n\nEdit: I should have known to check the options before posting. And the community change to Irish league adds to the awesomeness. Now I can fully recommend this game. Thanks for the addictive football, developers.

There are a number of things you can upgrade for your club (stadium, scouts, coaches, etc.) to help improve the players you have and club finances. However, it becomes a bit of a grind and there is a lack of variety to the gameplay beyond this.\n\nOverall, it's likely to keep you entertained for a little while, or a bit longer if you multi-task like me and play the game sporadically in addition to doing other things. There's a lot of potential with this title and I would expect "Football Tactics 2" at some point, with development of the current gameplay and a load of additional features.\n\nScore: 3/5","April 22","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
