I played it on the second to the hardest difficulty, will definitely replay on impossible difficulty and try different weapons and upgrades. Guns sound great, one of the best things about the game is how powerful the weapons feel - but the aliens are still a scary threat despite the punch your weapons have. Awesome map design with 20 secrets to find in the highly detailed environments, i found 5/20 first playthrough - secrets unlock interesting new options for gameplay such as "super physics" or "black and white mode" Final battle seems a bit weak compared to some of the previous challenges already overcome - but still an awesome sequence of gameplay nearing the finale!

Unmistakable because if you didn't see the title you'd be hard pressed to tell them apart.\n\nThat's not to say Survivor doesn't introduce a few new features, multiple playable characters and a more detailed level progression makes the game a good deal more engaging as you go along. The storyline is as was in the original utterly forgettable and can be easily ignored.\n\nThe greatest strength of Shadowgrounds Survivor is once again it's use of atmospheric lightning which does a good job at turning otherwise bland encounters with the alien horde into something a little more suspenseful, lending somewhat from the horror genre.\n\nThe problem is also, once again, that this is a genre that has done it all before, the top down shooter horde mode gives you nothing new, nothing you haven't seen a hundred times before. You go from room to room in a linear progression stopping only to pick up the occasional ammo pack in between scripted attacks by the same massive blob of aliens you've already killed in the last ten rooms. Even the boss battles mostly boils down to the same run and gun tactics as the rest of the game making playing the game feel like a grind the more you progress.\n\nAll in all as with the original the problem is that Shadowgrounds does nothing to innovate. It adds nothing that you didn't see in the last five games you played int this genre and that makes it a tiresome experience for anyone but the most hardcore fans.","June 3, 2013","false","22.5"," 37 of 57 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","37","57","3","0"

It's a pretty well-made game, all about shooting hordes and hordes of pesky zombies from a top-down perspective. The story isn't remarkable in any way: three survivors of a massive alien attack try to "get out" in any way possible.\n\nDeveloper Frozenbyte has however improved upon the original in several ways. First of all, the three characters manage to come across as individuals, not as thirteen-in-a-dozen heroes, mostly thanks to the excellent voice-acting (although it's sometimes over-the-top, but better this than bland voices). Secondly, the weapons-arsenal is pretty neat, with a very distinctive "feel" about every weapon and individual weapons for all three character. Added to this is a well thought-out weapons- and character upgrade-system, which adds a light rpg-flavour to the game. Don't expect any keep of delving deep into weapons' customization or character builing, but still, it's pretty well done and really adds some much-needed depth to the gameplay.\n\nThe original Shadowgrounds already had some solid graphics and these are markedly improved upon in Survivor. Especially light&shadows, explosions, fire effects (awesome flamethrower!!) and physics-effects are really impressive. Just as in the original, level-design is more than decent, with several items to search for and a logical built-up of each level. I found the game to be a tad short: after just under 5 hours I was through the singleplayer-campaign, not even having unlocked all of the character and weapons-upgrades. This can be done in the six unlockable missions where you have to keep alive for as long as possible, but since the leaderbords are dead now, that's fairly useless. Actually I wanted to play along for a bit longer, which is always a good sign. Alas, there have been seven years past since its release, so it seems like this little "franchise" will stay at two items forever.\n\nAll in all, this is totally recommendable game for anyone who fancies shooting dozens of zombies in a no-brains way. I feel it's a bit expensive (7 euro at the moment) for a small-scale seven years' old game, but it gets discounts quite often, especially in a pack together with the original Shadowgrounds. Steam trading cards are a welcome addition too, Steam achievements are not here.\n\nOverall score: 7.5/10","September 11, 2014","true","5.5"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","1"

They all have 3 different playstyles, weapons, and abilities;\n\nPlay as:\n\nThe Marine, with the Pistol, Pulse Rifle, Rocket Launcher, and Frag Grenades.\n\nAs Napalm, the drunk Shotgun, Flamethrower, Minigun, and Poison Grenade wielding dude.\n\nOr as Sniper, equipped with a Pistol, Rail Gun, Plasma Rifle, and EMP Grenades.\n\nOverall, the game was a bit too easy (well, at least easier than the first) as I NEVER used any of my portable medkits. Also, theres way too many crescendo events (get barriered in, kill a ♥♥♥♥ ton of aliens until they're all dead or something unlocks, etc) sprinkled throughout the game.\n\nAlso theres only like one boss, and thats near the beginning of the game, any other "boss" after that are bloody crescendo events. The first game had at least several bosses :/\n\nNot a bad experience, definitely faster paced (for the most part) than the first game, but I actually kind of liked the first game a bit better.\n\nAnyway, if you're a fan of top-down shooters, give this a try when its on sale.","October 6, 2014","true","4.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

As opposed to the blanket machine-part upgrade system of Shadowgrounds, Survivor has implemented a more refined approach, with unique class abilities, general class abilities and weapon abilities tailored to each of the three characters.\n\nBasic gameplay is still kill or be killed, run and gun, etc. Every kill nets you some experience, which is banked toward increased levels, and each level brings with it some upgrade points. Weapon upgrade parts are still found on the battlefield, dropped by enemies, but now you also get class-specific abilities and character tweaks. These are what increase with each level. Using the marine as an example, you'll be able to buy quick weapon reloads, tough skin and fragmentation grenades. This is in addition to the basic set of character improvements that all three avatars have: radar display, increased health, critical hits, and an "auto-doctor" that will dose you with a health kit (if you have one stockpiled) if you fall below 50% health at any time.\n\nSurvivor really beefed up the graphics. Lighting, already a major element of the ambience of Shadowgrounds, has been used to even greater effect this time. I lost count of how many rounds I wasted shooting at flickering movement that I thought was an enemy but was really just shadows playing off of my flashlight beam. Shaders have also been given some love, textures and particle effects. The overall effect is beautiful.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nIt is easy to control after re-mapping the keys to your liking. Some weapons have secondary fire and there is lots and lots of action. This is the non-thinking man's action title.\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nSurprisingly, the game looks way better then the original; I know that's not uncommon (duh), but for a value title, the spit and polish rivals that of other full-priced games.\n\nSound: 7/10\nI liked the voiceovers the characters had, and the ambient music does provide the right feel for the game, but some sound effects are lacking.\n\nDifficulty: Medium\nYou can set the difficulty to your liking.\n\nConcept: 7/10\nA well-used idea, wrapped neatly in a simple game that is surprisingly fun and entertaining.\n\nOverall: 8/10\nYou must like killing aliens, lots of action and the kind of game where it pays to go looking down deserted dark corridors.","March 13","true","9.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The game is essentially the same as the first except this time you have a number of characters to play at telling the story rather than one (hence the title). The story didnt really hit home at any point and like the first the dialogue is dire, though I didnt mind as I found I was happy exploring the environments killing waves of enemies with the different typres of character & weapon classes. The weapon upgrade system is similar to the first but with less in the fact that you have to upgrade multiple characters rather than the one and these are limted to certain weapon types (I was sad to see the epic laser rifle from the first game was missing). Like the first you need to play on the higher difficulty levels otherwise it isnt difficult; that said some of the survival sections are decent back to the wall affairs.\nOverall I perfer the first game, but this is a decent addition & worth playing if you liked the first also\n\nN.B.\nYOU MAY NEED TO D/L NVIDIA PHYSX DRIVERS TO GET IT TO RUN, goto the Nvidia website its simple & removes any crashing issues(THIS INCLUDES AMD CARDS)","March 14, 2014","true","9.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Like its predecessor Survivor is intensive and fast-paced action from square one until the end. Frozenbyte has added a little bit of RPG elements into the game, which is a nice touch. The game is pretty short and a little bit too easy, but it’s not sold at full price and the modding tools are good, so it’s well worth the money.","February 18, 2014","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After beating it, two new difficulty levels are unlocked, several survival maps and extra options (If you found enough secrets) to help you or make things silly in the second playthrough (If you want to do it).\nAlso it has a map editor and coop, although I don't think that it has a very active communitty.\n\nIn short, is a REALLY short game that does not a lot of things, but it does them right. Its not a great game but it is also not a bad game.

First off, if you play this game immedietly turn off the free camera so that it drops it into an isometric third person shooter. This mimics the first game's camera and it improves the playability of the game immensly.\n\nIt isn't the worst game, but it pales so much to the first one. It does a decent job at makeing the different 'characters' play differently...but the sniper basically puts the game on easy mode. Not to mention the ending...or rather 'non-ending'.\n\nBut my biggest gripe comes from changing the flashlight system. In the first game it matteres to manage it since running out of power where it has to recharge in the dark...is bad. However in this game most of the enviroments you don't need a flashlight. This removes the fun and tense moments of entering a dark room, turning on the flashlight, and realising you are in a nest of critters.\n\nPros:\n-Characters play differently\n-Graphics are pretty\n-Decent Isometric shooter\n\nCons:\n-Need to play the first game for the 'story'\n-Camera is awful until you make it 'classic' style\n-Characters are flatter then paper\n-Flashlight mechanic sucks now\n-Sniper makes the game to easy\n\nGet this one on sale, and only in a bundle with the first one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/11200/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","Shadowgrounds: Survivor is a top-down shooter set in a darkened environment. A game from 2007, its graphics have aged poorly, but not nearly so poorly as its predecessor; still, close-ups on faces look quite terrible. On the whole, it is a great improvement over its predecessor, with superior pacing and voice acting, and it feels less like a low-budget title. Still, it gets repetitive at the end, and unlike the first game, it lacks boss fights. As such, I would generally recommend Alien Swarm, which is free on Steam, over paying for this game.\n\nStory\n\nA base on Ganymede has been attacked by a horde of aliens. Three survivors work together to save the world:\nA soldier, who is the last member of his platoon and is trying to work his way back to the colony.\nAn old Russian janitor, who seems to enjoy setting things on fire.\nA sniper, who keeps a count of every kill she gets.\nThey are assisted by a scientist, saved early on in the soldier’s sections, who helps them set up the defense of the colony.\nThe game’s story is very bare-bones and exists to serve the gameplay, and in that role, it is adequate; the voice acting is fine and not phoned-in, unlike the first game, and on the whole it serves its purpose, though why the aliens are there is never clarified – though on the other hand, maybe it doesn’t matter.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game is a top-down shooter. Each character has three weapons plus grenades, and each character has a special power that only they can activate. As you kill aliens, you find upgrades for your weapons, which makes them more powerful and gives them alternate fire mechanisms, and gain experience, which allows you to directly upgrade your characters’ abilities and stats.\nOn the whole, the gameplay is reasonably engaging, and by switching between different characters with different weapon sets, the game keeps its gameplay somewhat fresh. Unfortunately, by about halfway through the game you have encountered every type of alien present in the game, and as a result the second half of the game is mostly greater and greater numbers of aliens, with the odd “defend the area” or “ride around in a mech shooting things” or “sit in a turret shooting things” thrown in. As a result, the game does wear a bit thin by the end, though the game on the whole isn’t terribly long.\nThere is a secret hidden in each level, a S lying around on the ground, which adds a minor exploration aspect to the game, but on the whole, I didn’t really feel driven to find the things. Still, it was nice that there weren’t an excessive number of collectables.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe game was made in 2007, and while it looks okay when you are looking from the third-person, well-above-the-character perspective, whenever the characters speak their faces are shown on-screen and look absolutely terrible. On the whole, the graphics are serviceable, but it has not aged well and nothing looks really spectacular.\n\nFinal Summary\n\nThe game is a competent third-person shooter, and you could do worse. However, Alien Swarm is still probably a better game, and it is free on Steam.\n","August 20, 2014","false","9.0"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","1"

Basically nothing big is changed except that they added a character upgrade system besides the weapon upgrade system, and that there are three fighting characters instead of one since you are only allowed to carry 3 weapons plus granades.\n\nFirst of all, the linux port run okay but there's a sound issue that is very annoying. After a while the sounds seem to be competing each other for the speaker and the gun shots are skipping, and then it breaks down completely and there is no more sound. I'll have to restart the game to get the sounds back, and if this happens in mid game then I must finish the level companied with complete silence since there are no saves. This happens a lot when there's a lot of environmental sound like rain and snow. It's like ten times I had to restart before I can finish this game.\n\nI think this game has a lot of potential but somewhat inferior compared to the previous Shadowgrounds. Design is sloppy because there're no new monsters, and there isn't one boss (or there is? i can't remember). Three characters are a redundancy except for the story to unfold because there are no online multiplayer, and the story is simply too short for all of them to get their own stage.\n\nI'm rather disappointed with this game because there's only silght graphic boost and they basically just reused elements that were available. The story aren't good.\n\n5/10.","July 12, 2014","false","0.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Tip: check the forums for a link to install legacy physx drivers for the fix. Is it worth the trouble? ♥♥♥♥ no. And since it is pretty much the same game as the first one, here is a copy paste of that review.\n\nI can without the slightest hesitation say that this game has the worst voice acting I have ever heard in my life. It is hilarious. Graphics suck really bad too.\n\nFortunately there is no reason to talk about any more specifics of the game because of one game breaking flaw. The game might as well be unplayable because of it: invisible enemies that do heavy unavoidable damage to you. The only way you can uncover them is to continuously fire when you hear their noise, but even if I do and kill one and the sound the monster makes stops, I get ♥♥♥♥♥ by a silent second one for major unavoidable damage. No matter what hits you in the game you take major dmg and your life is constantly dropping like it is falling on a broken evelator plummeting to the ground, killing all the people on board and killing this game dead. I consider it a mercy killing. The faster I got to the uninstall button the ♥♥♥♥ing happier I was. So that is a huge game flaw. You get 5 respawns but it doesn't matter even if you have 500 respawns when your life bar falls quicker than a fat guy's self restraint in a icecream shop. Out of "respawns"? You get to start the ENTIRE long, boring, vomit-like muddy-graphic having level over. Even without these what I consider game breaking flaws, the game is incredibly generic. Much better similar titles exist, stay far away from this.\n\n1/10.

I was finally able to get the game to launch by installing an old PhysX driver which was suggested in one of the other negative reviews here. Even after this the game continued to crash at different spots during Chapter 3 though, requiring me to reboot my PC and start that Chapter over again every time. It happened multiple times before I completely gave up on the game.\n\nIt's a shame because I did enjoy the first Shadowgrounds. With the technical issues myself and many others are having with this I'd say it's best to avoid it.

At first this game reminded me of WarCraft III mode, but some cool details, as weapon upgrades, different characters, neat graphics and full camera circle pushes this game one step further.\nTher are couple things, I did'nt like about this game:\n\n- Survival mode takes to much time to load, even when you choose 'Try again', you have to going thru process of choose charater and weapons again and agi every single time (Maybe -fast reload- button?)\n\n- I bought this game at The Humble Store for the low price - €0,79 instead of €7,99. Low price and the fact that game works on Linux makes me buy this game. However, after redeeming key on Steam, I wasn't able to play this under Linux. Quick search on the game studio's forum shows me that even when dowload directly from the Humble Store a version for Linux, one must have to do lot of hacking/patching to make game works on Ubuntu. Developers should fix this as soon as possible\n\n- The last one: Main campaign is a little bit short, I managed to finish it in some 6 hours of playing, on easy level of difficulty, though (1 of 5 levels).\n\nConclusion.  Despite some downsides, I'm glad to have this one in my collection. I hope that replaying campaign at more diffucult levels, survival mode, a eventually the coop mod will\nprovide additional  fun gaming hours.\n\n","September 17, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The other three weapons are unique to each character.\n\nThe upgrade system has been revamped. This time around you can upgrade your character as well as your weapons. And different characters have different upgrades.\n\nAgain not much of a story but definitely very fun playing. Also allows local co-op, but I havent tried it yet. If the sale is on, then I would say go get it. Fun timepass.\n\n8/10","August 3, 2014","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first this game reminded me of WarCraft III mode, but some cool details, as weapon upgrades, different characters, neat graphics and full camera circle pushes this game one step further.\nTher are couple things, I did'nt like about this game:\n\n- Survival mode takes to much time to load, even when you choose 'Try again', you have to going thru process of choose charater and weapons again and agi every single time (Maybe -fast reload- button?)\n\n- I bought this game at The Humble Store for the low price - €0,79 instead of €7,99. Low price and the fact that game works on Linux makes me buy this game. However, after redeeming key on Steam, I wasn't able to play this under Linux. Quick search on the game studio's forum shows me that even when dowload directly from the Humble Store a version for Linux, one must have to do lot of hacking/patching to make game works on Ubuntu. Developers should fix this as soon as possible\n\n- The last one: Main campaign is a little bit short, I managed to finish it in some 6 hours of playing, on easy level of difficulty, though (1 of 5 levels).\n\nConclusion.  Despite some downsides, I'm glad to have this one in my collection. I hope that replaying campaign at more diffucult levels, survival mode, a eventually the coop mod will\nprovide additional  fun gaming hours.\n\n","September 17, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls took a brief getting-used-to, and once I had, I was roll-flipping-behind-the-back shotgunning aliens in 360 degrees.  So fun.\n\n[EDIT] Below is no longer relevant - since I last payed ages ago, the devs have added a setup utility to scale graphics (and more importantly physics) detail - blast away!  I now recommend this game.\n\nThis sequel introduced physics objects - which I think is actually a very bad idea, as they briefly slow down the flow of time in the game on older computers.  Part of what makes this original Shadowgrounds so great is it's silky-smooth and consistent gameplay throughout.  Nothing drives me nuts more than inconsistent flow-of-time / speed-of-time in a game.  (I'm looking at YOU, EA.)  I'd much rather have simple graphics and solid-as-steel gameplay than super HD realism and feeling like some man behind the curtain is filddling with the universe's speed-dial, screwing up my reaction time.\n\nSeriously.  Action games are all about reflexes, judging and anticipating movement - hitting stuff that moves with other stuff that moves.  If you were about to hit a baseball as it flies towards your bat at 92.6 miles an hour... and suddenly, 10 feet before it reaches you, just as you are releasing your wind-up... the ball decides to move at 84.5 mile an hour until it passes your already-swung bat, accelerating to an unexplainable 135 miles an hour as it no-clips through the wall.

On the one hand, it has all the elements for a really good shooter, and also manages to meld them with some RPG elements on the side to keep things interesting.\n\nThe graphics have not aged very well, but they are very serviceable along with the versatile game engine they work on. It's really quite fast, even with all the dynamic shadowing and lighting going on. Problem is, getting all that to work is a pain since you have to install an outdated version of PhysX back when it was owned by Ageia.\n\nThe soundtrack is top-notch surprisingly, It really does help sell the atmosphere and knows how to transition from that feeling to pure hectic fun when it wants to. The gun effects all sounds really quite effective and powerful. My only gripe is with the creatures' effects, they are all pretty lacking in a way and really failed to get me excited about my fights with them whenever there were no jumpscares to be had. Voice acting isn't too bad and works well for the most part aside from some cringeworthy situations.\n\n\nA lengthy campaign is a gift that keeps on giving, except when the story is absolutely horrible in writing, and pacing. Could've gone better with some changes to the script and the game's pacing, but I hear the original title is a lot better in that regard.","November 15, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The RPG upgrade system is very simple, yet functional, more of an RPG-lite than an full-blown RPG system with stats and other whatnots. The shooting mechanics are solid, which is good, because you will be spending a LOT of time doing that in this game. The story and characters are nothing to write home about, just save generic space colony 9 from alien menace #101, with a rather generic space marine, a pyromaniac, and a special forces sniper. Overall, I'd give this a 7/10, for when it was made.\n\nTL;DR, if you're looking at this game, but are torn between the original, or this one, get Shadowgrounds, the original.\nI can't help but feel they took one step forwards with two steps back in this release, looking forward to more from this developer.","March 18, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The not-so-original plot of mass alien invasion is at the core of the game and in turn, provides whichever character you currently control - plenty of enemies to shoot and kill.\n\nAlong the way, you control the typical grunt, armed with a pistol, pulse rifle and rocket launcher. There's also the female sniper who also has a pistol, railgun and plasma rifle. The last of the controllable characters has a flamethrower, shotgun and minigun at his disposal. None of the stages are particularly hard on standard difficulty and SS itself is not a particularly long game either. I completed it in under 4 hours, with the final 'stage' of the game actually being easier than earlier parts of the game.\n\nHowever, you can play the game in co-op and this makes it much more enjoyable as a result.

Let’s see how it does it.\n\nFirst off, the gameplay is almost exactly the same.  Shoot aliens, collect upgrade parts, get new weapons, repeat.  The twist this time, though, is the addition of RPG elements for your 3 distinct characters.  The Marine, Exterminator, and Sniper all have their own set of specialized weapons, and they play completely differently.  You can also upgrade their specific abilities, giving them area control powers or instant kill moves.  This little bit of variation gives a huge boost to this game over the original.\n\nBut that is hardly all the improvements that were made.  The graphics are noticably improved as well.  The detail is much sharper, and there are a lot more interactive objects.  Frozenbyte did a great job making the levels this time around, as they all are relatively easy to nagivate, rather than the directionless mazes from the last game.  There is much less emphasis on finding keys to progress in this game, it is focused on what the title says: Survival.\n\nAmmo is a non-issue, even for your special weapons.  It flows so fast and plentiful you will almost always be at capacity.  This allows you to approach different encounters and have fun with them, seeing if you can kill 25 aliens with just a rocket launcher or sniper rifle.\n\nThe story in this game stays largely out of the way, and it is probably a little more interesting because of that.  The (relatively) improved voice acting definitely helps.  Instead of single-handedly trying to stop the alien invasion through brute force, you are simply trying to assist a single colony to survive and repel the advancing army.\n\nAll this comes together to make an enjoyable romp.  Shoot aliens, improve your weapons, shoot some more aliens.  The three characters are all unique and fun to play.  It is also fun to go back and play levels you’ve beaten in Survival mode, an endless assault of aliens.  Play to try and beat your high scores.\n\nSequels are not usually such vast improvements.  The upgrade system, the graphics, and the story all saw major change for the better here.  If you liked Shadowgrounds, you’ll really like Survivor.  If you skipped Shadowgrounds because of its faults, give Survivor a closer look.  You might like what you see.","April 5","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the one hand, it has all the elements for a really good shooter, and also manages to meld them with some RPG elements on the side to keep things interesting.\n\nThe graphics have not aged very well, but they are very serviceable along with the versatile game engine they work on. It's really quite fast, even with all the dynamic shadowing and lighting going on. Problem is, getting all that to work is a pain since you have to install an outdated version of PhysX back when it was owned by Ageia.\n\nThe soundtrack is top-notch surprisingly, It really does help sell the atmosphere and knows how to transition from that feeling to pure hectic fun when it wants to. The gun effects all sounds really quite effective and powerful. My only gripe is with the creatures' effects, they are all pretty lacking in a way and really failed to get me excited about my fights with them whenever there were no jumpscares to be had. Voice acting isn't too bad and works well for the most part aside from some cringeworthy situations.\n\n\nA lengthy campaign is a gift that keeps on giving, except when the story is absolutely horrible in writing, and pacing. Could've gone better with some changes to the script and the game's pacing, but I hear the original title is a lot better in that regard.","November 15, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reading the description I was expecting a full sequel, but this is an expansion pack at best. It adds very little to the original formula, and misses a chance to fix some issues and bring the series to a higher level:\n\nPROS:\n- Three different characters, with different weapons and different skill sets.\n- Simple RPG style upgradable character skills.\n- Better voice acting.\n- Enhanced physics using NVIDIA Physx; everything can be moved around and destroyed, updated enemy gibbing.\n- Slightly more detailed environments, fog, better particle effects.\n- Secrets unlock new gameplay options.\n- More varied environments; snowy landscapes, rainy canyon, lava cave, sewers...\n- Survival mode.\n- The mech.\n\nCONS:\n- The campaign can be finished in 4-5 hours, which is half of the time it took me to finish the original. Just when I upgraded all my characters the game was already over.\n- Maps are tiny compared to the original game, and are much more linear.\n- There are no side missions like in the original, you basically just have to survive from start to end of the level.\n- The stories of the three characters have no touching points. Even when they finally meet, you have to just pick one of them to continue. It would be much more interesting if they interracted more during the story, or if you could play with all of them at the same time like in RPG games or like they did it in The Thing.\n- There is only one new type of enemy.\n- The AI isn't fixed, and enemies still sometimes get stuck, I feel sorry for them :(\n\nBtw, some reviews here mention problems running the game on Windows 7 64bit, but I had no problems.\n\nAt the end I had fun playing this "expansion", and the last part, where you have to pick your character, I replayed with each one of them. The gameplay is very fun, but unfortunatelly Frozenbyte lacked either the ambition or the money to bring the series to a higher level, plus the modding community missed a chance to make some interesting mods. It was fun while it lasted.","April 25","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fun and frantic top down shooter. All about battling hordes of invading aliens set to a story driven campaign. Better voice acting than the first Shadowgrounds and with three playable characters this time around.","May 11","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
