You will spend your first 50-100+ matches just reloading to hope you start with a bunch of houses that don't have enemies so that you can get enough men to fight back. You start with 1 level 1 hunter and the first fight is usually 4 zombies in 3 lanes. If you have all the pregame upgrades though, you start with 5 level 5 hunters which completely changes things.\n\n-Pregame upgrade costs are way too high given their necessity.\n\nMany games use this method of unlock as a means to introduce the player slowly to game mechanics (intentionally balancing around all unlocks being obtained). This is a fine method when the time it takes is mild and just enough to learn game mechanics....but in "Hunters of the Dead" its a pathetic means to extend the game life by making you bang your head against the RNG wall until you have grinded enough coins to get the unlocks so you can "actually" play the game.\n\n","January 11, 2015","false","0.5"," 47 of 61 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","47","61","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/318570/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Hunters of the Dead is a lane defense game featuring an overhead map in which you decide which buildings to capture. No idea why its tagged as a tower defense game. It is set in a steampunk universe in which you are tasked with destroying Dracula and various undead creatures. You will need to build a squad of Hunters to accomplish this and you acquire them by rescuing them from their homes.  They can not continue fighting indefinitely, they will need to rest  after too many battles. It is a neat feature but also a double edged sword. It keeps the game from being too easy but it is also frustrating when you lose the game because half of your troops couldn't be bothered to fight the undead that are about to destroy humanity because they have one more day off work. It doesn't help that each day only goes by once you occupy a building but there is no way of knowing the chances of a random encounter so a lot of the times you will end up having to futilely throw your inexperienced rookies to the slaughter. You are expected to lose time and time again since this game doesn't really have balancing, requiring you to gather up money and upgrade your units and troops for the next play-through.\n\nGameplay consists of trying to keep your Hunters rested and healthy while capturing buildings surrounding your base. Not even sure why they bothered with a base, it doesn't matter if you are fighting on the far edge of the map, if a enemy reaches the end of a lane your base will somehow take damage so it may as well just be called  a health bar. The actual fighting is rather simple you defend 5 lanes with the very small variety of Hunter with certain weapons including a Sniper,  Machinegun, Shotgun, Sword and the basic handgun unit. Those are all the units in this game excluding a certain powerful Swordsman you unlock by gathering enough gold through consecutive deaths. You can use abilities during battles like healing units or destroying enemies but these cost gold you use to be stronger in future playthroughs. Each unit has its own use on the battlefield and none felt useless and they will level up after killing enough enemies gaining extra life and AP points. Action Points are used every time you send a unit to battle and every time you move them between lanes.\n\nThe town is randomly generated every time you play but it doesn't matter much since there are only 6 buildings and the bland gray background never changes. It also only has one very dull map for all the battles which further worsen the feeling of repetition and tedium. Dracula himself shows up randomly and is a very powerful foe but will not take to great a chunk of health if he reaches the end of a lane so it may be wiser to build up your forces more instead of confronting him right away. You should also keep a very close eye on your units AP or you may run into a situation where most of your units are resting and lose the game from a random encounter. Healing a unit doesn't rest his fatigue and resting doesn't heal the unit so if a unit is out of AP and heavily injured he will be out of action for quite some time. Other than that there is not much strategy and mostly consists of dumb luck and how much you have upgraded stuff through previous attempts.\n\nVisuals are not awful or good, they simply do the job and do nothing to stand out. Though all that gray is rather unappealing to look at after a time. Same with music and sound effects, they are just there. User Interface is pretty decent and makes it easy to see how your units are doing and simply clicking on a portfolio of a character lets you make him rest, heal him or equip him all on the same screen. There is one nasty thing about the UI that the devs overlooked, you can't see a section of the health and AP of your unit on the bottom lane due to the healing ability button  covering the bottom part of your unit's bar. That means you don't know how close he is the death and if he has any AP to move before he dies. Animations are all right but if an enemy dies mid attack he continues attacking but does no damage to your unit thankfully, it is a small nitpick but I found it fairly annoying since it can distract you from enemies that are still a threat.\n\nYes, even after all that I still had some fun with it. It is not a bad game but it is seriously lacking in content and quickly grows tedious. Play it for 5 minutes and you will see all it has to offer. All that is left then is to lose time and time again in an effort to upgrade and get a bit further each playthrough. So pretty much the whole game is one huge grindfest to finally have a chance at winning. That in itself wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so bare-bone and repetitive. I would not recommend this game to anybody unless it receives a significant content update in the future or those that got it as a gift and don't want to seem rude by not playing it.","January 24, 2015","false","3.2"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","25","29","0","0"

The randomness in the game pretty much guarantees that no two games will be exactly the same.  Graphics are good enough and very much resemble the ever popular Plants Vs Zombies style.\n\nYou basic goal is to assemble a big and well enough equipped group of warriors to defeat Dracula when you find him, as he is one tough hombre.  Find him by accident too early in the game, and you best stay out of his way, and hope you have enough defense built up to survive his attack.\n\nThe game begins with your base tower in the middle of a dark town that will expand as you explore it.  This town is completely random every time you play the game.  You can click on any building to explore it, and each time take a chance on a "battle" scenario explained below.  There are several different types of buildings that give you different benefits when explored.  For example exploring a house will light it up and give you a new companion to your team, always seeming to start at level 1.  Opening a hospital gives you the ability to heal wounded warriors from battles by sending that warrior "away" for 1-5 turns, each turn being one more click of a building to explore.  Other buildings give you additial defense that you are trying to protect against the undead in the battles, while still other buildings such as gun shops can give your warriors better weapons to fight with.\n\nAny time you click any building, you have what seems to be about a 15% chance of entering a battle against a random number and type of undead creatures, and if lucky (or unlucky enough) you will also find Dracula himself attacking your defenses.  Your goal here on these screens is to prevent the undead zombies, liches, skeletons, and more from beating down your defenses to 0.  This happens in a gameplay style that very much resembles that of Plants Vs Zombies with the baddies coming at you from the right side and you placing your warrior(s) on the left to try and take them down before they reach your wooden spiked fence behind you on the left side of the screen.  Should they get past you, they will die on the spiked fence, but not before taking down your defense total which starts at 200 each game.  They also might kill or wound your warriors you place in the battlefield.  Die, and say so long for good to them.  Wounds can be healed by sending them away for 1 to 5 turns at a hospital, assuming you have uncovered one.\n\nAll in all, a fun little single player challenge that is worth the $5 asking price IMO.  Watch my video above for a better demonstration of how the game plays.\n\nHope this helps you, and good luck should you find Dracula early on!  You'll need it!  ;-)","September 4, 2014","true","3.3"," 57 of 86 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","57","86","2","0"

As another reviewer said, this game does not deserve the hate it's getting. It's an interesting concept of making Plants vs Zombies a rogue-lite. I think the game needs a bit better style of tutorial, it attempts to teach you really important things with popup boxes and if you skip it, you have to learn the hard way.  You really need to read everything the game tells you. It's super duper important you realize that houses closer to your base have easier fights. I think a good strategy is never spend your gold on actual fights, just spend it on the upgrades that carry over. I heard another gripe about having to "grind" out the upgrades but I was able to get every upgrade within 3.3 hours of playtime. I honestly think my biggest complaint is that the actual combat characters' models and animations look goofy. Also, I haven't beaten Dracula yet but there may be a replayability issue after I do.","November 14, 2015","true","4.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

In essence, you need to find and defeat Dracula in a randomly generated map with various buildings that provide your stronghold with soldiers, various bonuses, buffs or weapons. Your soldiers can equip a weapon that has various range, power and limitations, and also need to rest, meaning that some strategic thinking must still be used. Battles take place in a rectangle 5-lane grid Plants vs Zombies style, and just like in PvZ, you need to face off against opponents of various difficulty (with their own range, power, HP and limitations), and eventually defeat Dracula, the final boss.\n\nThe Good:\n1.

Yes, but for me it never became frustratingly obnoxious because I enjoyed the gameplay enough to continue. Eventually you buy up all the skills and beat the game, but probably not much before then. I also beat the game on hard mode.\n\nI hope this game gets a sequel since I think this type of building off the familiar with a new concept deserves to be encouraged and expanded upon. A sequel with a more elaborate upgrade tree, more character classes, and a slightly less tedious start to the game would be awesome.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/318570/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","Hunters of the Dead, by Traptics, is a monster hunter, tower defense, rogue-like game. In this game you will start with a base of operations, and a randomized grid of city buildings that will enhance your ability to survive monster attacks. The catch is that the layout is always going to be completely random, as is the times when clearing a section of the city causing a fight to occur. Now of course the biggest and baddest of old school monsters will definitely keep you on your toes through the duration of the game that you can survive, and that of course is Dracula.\n\nGraphically this game defintely gives off the feel of what city buildings in a dark age town terrorized by monsters should look like. There are pieces of the art, especially the battle area, that feel a bit rushed. This also goes with the hero character designs, I feel like they are trying to make a serious game and at the same time try to do a parady of what they are doing, which is really confusing.\n\nThe music in the game definitely gives you the monster hunter vibes. The voices in the game are interesting, it's hard to peg them down. The thing is that voices are randomly given to your units so you never know which of the 4 or 5 voices your units are going to have. Some of the voices get old really fast, others well they just kind of go away after a while because you hear them so often. I will tell you what though, when I hear Dracula speak I do have that instant feeling of dread, probably because I'm about to lose everything in the fight.\n\nThe controls are really simply, its a point and click system, though it is in real time for the battles, so depending on the speed of the enemies you are facing, you either can wait a while or have to move fast, and sometimes you are not going to be fast enough.\n\nThis is your definition of a grind game. You are going to fail completely A LOT of times before you actually feel like you are getting anywhere in the game. One of the cheats that I like to use, to help prolong my game sessions is, when I hear Dracula's speech I immediately exit to the main menu and select the continue option. This will place you back in the game right before you selected that game tile that caused the Dracula attack. Hell if you really want to this is also one hell of a way to avoid fights until you are ready.\n\nSpeaking of ready, this is the biggest qualm I have with the game, your units have a set number of action points. They do not replenish after combat, it takes 2 for them to be entered into combat, and additional ones if you want to move them around in combat. The problem is that when they run out they go and rest. Now there are buildings that you can "gain" that will help keep down the number of rounds you have to rest before a unit comes back, but if your unit was on its last leg, health-wise, its going to be the exact same after resting. So in order to get your unit back to where it needs to be you will have to send them home to rest and then select an amount of turns for the unit to then visit the hospital. This is also the only way to get your units healed.\n\nThere are many buildings in the game, and they are all vital to you surviving. There's the tower which will add to your base's current defensive number. There's the houses which will add a unit to your cause, all of them will be found at level 1.  There are the cemeteries thatare used to train units. There's the goods store, which decreases the amount of turns need for resting a unit. There's the gun store which will give you a randomly selected weapon, that if you have a regular unit will be equipped to them (machine gun, shotgun, sword, sniper rifle). There are hospitals that will help heal your units when they are sent there. Finally there are the gadget stores, which apparently help out your units, but I've never figured out in what way really.\n\nI am going to just tell you right now that I went ahead a played this game over and over again so that I could accumulate the money needed to unlock all the upgrades. You see, an interesting aspect of the game, is that the money you accumulate in game sticks around even after a complete defeat. Now after you have unlocked everything, you are going to find that the game is still probably going to chew you up and spit you out. In my opinion there's so much micro-managing and guessing that the fun gets sucked out. There's also a ton of questions that are felt while playing this game. The main one is, why the hell is it that when I'm 6 buildings away from my base I'm magically attacked at my base? Should I have not been able to detect the enemies moving towards my base and maybe plan accordingly so I'm not left with a single level 1 unit and everyone else is off training, resting, or healing? There's also the question, that crept into my mind after way too many playthroughs of, is this game actually beatable? I have tried my best to gear up for a Dracula attack, and I'm going to be honest, I don't think it is possible to survive and kill him. Sure there's the chance his hit on your base doesn't take you to zero, but to actually kill the warping all over the battlefield, Prince of Darkness, I just don't see it.\n\nThis is an interesting game, and there's a lot there that will have you coming back, trying different things, and hoping that the city layout will help you survive long enough to have units strong enough to take on all that will be dished out, but in the end there's just too many frustrating pieces for this game to contain the entertaining aspects of this game. So with that I have to give this game a 7.4 out of 10.","October 9, 2014","true","5.0"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","7"

Didn't think so.)  Much like in life, you start with a single building.  Around you, fading into the distance, more buildings.  I'll be honest, in 1.7 hours I still don't know what they all do.  Some of them give you people, some give you guns.  The rest?  What am I, an FAQ?\n\nYou click where you want and things change color.  Sometimes weird monsters come at you and you have to defend humanity, Plants vs Zombies style.  You'll lose.  Sometimes the very first thing you click on ends the game.  At the end of the game you get points you can spend to upgrade how you start.  More people, better guns, things and stuff.\n\nStaying alive the first few clicks becomes easier the more times you fail the human race.  Eventually, you'll have 30+ buildings under your control, a huge army, tons of weapons.  You'll feel tough.  Then you'll click on something and all your people will decide they're sleepy and you get to watch as a horde of smug looking monsters walk from right to left unopposed so they can show you a game over screen.\n\nThis review would not be complete without mentioning the teleporting Dracula.  Randomly he appears on the battlefield, warping from place to place.  Don't bother deploying troops to stop him, as he warps behind them and that's about it.\n\nIt is a fun game in it's way.  I can't see someone putting dozens of hours in to it, but for $5 it's a fun couple of plays.  It's on sale as I write this.  $1.24.  Less than a cup of coffee, unless you get that 99 cent stuff at a gas station.  Which there isn't anything wrong with, mind you.

It is really good though, I got it on sale and have been very pleased.  It's kind of like plants vs zombies as far as gameplay, but has much less variation in units you control. They do however add new and unique elements to it to make it not simply a boring clone of pvz which is what a lot of these games turn out to be.\n\nThe game does require a whole lot of luck in order to beat it. You are not going to beat this early on, not until you have played and died tons of times. Not until you have played and built up enough gold in order to add global upgrades for all new games. It's good and bad in that sense, it makes it not too easy or short, but also a bit frustrating that it is almost impossible early on. I saw one review that said you don't run into monsters that often, but I seem to get attacked 1 out of every 2 or 3 moves that I make.  Part of winning is just pure luck that you click on a spot and simply don't get attacked during the round your players are resting. If you run into an attack your first 3/4 or 5 clicks it's going to be tough b/c your guys will be resting and you can't do anything which just lets your village get destroyed. You could also start off and not get attacked for 6 turns in a row with time to build up a nice army. This randomness gives me so many mixed feelings on this game. I have had several games that I run into dracula on my 2nd or 3rd enemy encounter and then it's either game over or nearly game over.\n\nOverall the game is good enough to get a thumbs up and is worth what I paid, but with a few tweaks it could of been a great game which I would of preferred over PvZ. It would be better if they added a system where you only run into an enemy every so many turns or showing you have certain turns which you know you won't hit an enemy, maybe even a ladder type system where you climb your way up while still having the town. Also, not being able to run into certain mobs unless your so far out from the center of town would be good too. I can't figure out the system in which the type of enemies spawn. I can sometimes select all the squares near the start then move outwards and run into very tough mobs a bit later on. Other times if I skip some closer squares then hit them just a little bit later all of a sudden its a crazy tough mob, then when I click the square far away it's a super weak mob.\n\nThere needs to be some kind of system other than what appears to be just 100% pure randomness with everything involved. You can even keep it being random if they had something where after a preset # of turns you take then brings a new enemy type into the mix. So that you know for 100% that within your first 5 turns you won't have a chance of running into tougher mobs. Then at 10 turns a new enemy type will randomly appear in the mix as well. It just needs some order to it to go from good / ok to great.","December 23, 2014","true","9.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","2"

Most titles feel like they've given all they had to you in mere minutes into the game. So, to my welcome surprise, this is a first one that has kept me coming back.\n\nIts gameplay is simple. Discover, expand and fight off waves after waves of the undead horde. And though it sounds simplistic, there are many a cases where you will feel overwhelmed by the number of choices you are going to make. To this, the randomly generated map and encounters contribute immensely. You could start off fine only to find your options getting limited or work it the other way around. Each and every press of the "New Game" button is guaranteed to give you a new, refreshing experience. It may frustrate you before you manage to get some upgrades running, but as you build up with upgrades you will get the hang of it leading you to make progress into it.\n\nThe graphics as well as the sound effects compliment it completely. They are not the technology of today's finest edge, but you don't expect that from an indie title. Instead, they are colourful, pretty and just enough to get you immersed into the game. The soundtracks don't feel loopy and the voice-acting on the characters is simply sweet!\n\nAll in all, this is my humble opinion but at the price you're getting this, it's a bargain. It's a very nice title. sure to pay off many hours of immersion and the way I see it, it's also a form of investment. I can't wait to see what the people who brought us HotD are capable of if this is a mere glimpse into their talent.\n\nSee you around, Hunters!","September 30, 2014","true","2.6"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

There's an upgrade section where you can spend your gold to become stronger for your next run. My advice is to try and get all the gold you can at the start, buy all the upgrades and then put your tactician cap on.\n\nThe main view acts as a board game where you click on different buildings that provide you with resources.

Each hunter only has a linited number of action points before they have to be rested and made inactive, they can also be replenished if you find resources to do so. while this is a nice idea in principle you can not skip a turn as such when a hunter is rested for AP or in hospital you still have to explore and each time you explore there is a risk of an encounter and if theres no active hunter or you lack AP then your base gets ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nOn principle all this sounds ok and it is ... sort of. as you play you earn points, these points can be used during battles to heal your hunters, kill all mobs on screen, as an xp boost etc, however these points are also the some points that are used to buy upgrades on the main menu that carry over all future games, such as starting with more hunters, increased starting level of hunters, better and more starting guns, strong base defences etc.\n\nNow heres the key gripe, the game is impossible to beat without significant investment in these upgrades, you simply grind the game to get the points to purchase all the upgrades from the main menu and then once done you play your final playthrough and complete the game.\n\nThere are no high score tables, no achievements to earn and as such little point in playing the game beyond earning trading cards.\n\nAs stated by others this feels very much like a freemium mobile game and I'm such it would have been a reasonable concept for it however asking £3.99 for this game when there are alternatives like Rebuild and Rebuild 2 available to play for free on the web paying for this game just does not make any sense.\n\nThere is no story, and no challange or reward for wanting to play this game any further, each time you play you'll earn points towards and upgrade and with each upgrade you will last that bit longer untill you have purchased enough upgrades to last long enough to complete the game and then thats it, the end.\n\nDev Feedback -\nAdd a high score table\nMake it so that hunters can move to anywhere on the board with one move not just one square up/down/left/right\nSeperate points used for ingame battle bonuses and menu upgrades\n\n\n***EDIT***\n\nWell after a few more hours of playthrough I am about to "complete" the game having obtained all upgrades and it's fair to say it has even more issues. The UI is too big and you can not zoom out far enough, once you explore 4 or 5 buildings away from your base buildings appear obstructed by the UI and even off the screen and are in accessable, it is entirely possible to break the game by running out of buildings to expore on screen if you do not kill the boss before doing so. Either needs a higher res which is not adjustable in game or ability to zoom out further.\n\n\n***EDIT#2***\nHaving just completed the game and a little late to find out you can move the screen around holding LMB down and moving mouse, something that could have perhaps been mentioned somewhere as it is kind of important.","January 12, 2015","false","3.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It's a conceptually interesting game, and all of the pieces are there. When they work together correctly the game can be a lot of fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sagesager/recommended/318570/","sagesager","Chopper Dave","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sagesager/","1227 products in account","Мне сложно определиться с жанром игры. Она использует механику Plants vs Zombies, но при этом тут мало контроля над набором "башенок". Это не рогалик тоже, потому что игра полагается ТОЛЬКО на рандом.\n\nСуть такая. Город, который нужно защитить от Дракулы. Дракула насылает на город нежить. Нужно защитить последнюю базу сопротивления от нежити и по возможности убить Дракулу. Вот-с.\nНа карте города разбросаны дома. В некоторых прячутся выжившие, их можно завербовать в качестве охотников на вампиров. В некоторых расположены оружейные магазинчики. Не стрелять же бойцам из ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥енького пистолета всю жизнь, правда? Есть аптеки, которые ускоряют выздоровление героев, есть пивнушки, куда бегут отдыхать уставшие бойцы, есть магазины и кладбища, дающие бонусные деньги и экспу для персонажей.\n\nЗдания открываются по очереди. Кликнули на одно - бонус. На второе кликнули - бонус. На третье - ой, на нас напааалии.\n\nИ вот здесь включается боевка. Клеточки, как в PvZ, по ним шагают зомби-скелеты, как в PvZ, на их пути расставляем бойцов из заначки. В зависимости от того, какое оружие парни выловили в оружейных магазинах (чистый рандом, повлиять никак нелья), у них изменяется площадь атаки. В отличие от PvZ, сколько у нас бойцов есть, столько мы выставить и сможем. Они еще могут сместиться на пару клеток, если пунктов выносливости хватает, но не более того.\nОчевидный вопрос: а может ли случиться так, что нападающих будет больше, чем защитников? Ну, мало ли, может убьют кого, что тогда делать?\n\nА вот и главная проблема. Да, количество зомбаков МОЖЕТ быть больше, чем герои смогут сдержать. Игроку может просто не повезти на выживших, может Дракула со своими войсками объявится на втором ходе, а может у солдат закончится выносливость (примерно три пункта на брата, один тратится за высадку во время боя и еще по одному за каждое перемещение), и тогда они пойдут бухать всей толпой. Кто останется драться? Может вообще никого не остаться. Зомби будут маршировать свободно.\nДойдут до конца поля - снимут у базы немного здоровья. Здоровье дойдет до нуля - ну, вы понимаете.\n\nТеоретически таких неприятных ситуаций можно избежать. Допустим, повезет найти кучу народа, и кучу пивнушек для них, чтобы они отдыхали быстрее, а еще отспавнится куча старых фортификаций, которые можно разобрать на кирпичи для базы. А может и не повезти, тут чистый рандом. Каждый - абсолютно каждый - ход может закончиться дракой. Количество нападающих предугадать тоже непросто. Более того, время от времени вылезает сам Дракула. Он быстро движется, телепортируется с клетки на клетку и в драке 1 на 1 может закошмарить любого охотника. Если пройдет, то врежет по штаб-квартире в три раза больнее, чем любой монстр.\n\nЧтобы игра не казалась такой уж несправедливой, в игре есть четыре пауэрапа, которые можно активровать на вырученные за победы (если таковые будут) деньги: можно дать солдатам двойную экспу после боя, вылечить всех, добавить огневой мощи или убрать всех врагов (кроме Дракулы) с поля. Или - все золотишко сохраняется после поражения - можно в стартовом меню купить парочку бустов: стартовать с дополнительными наемниками, с дополнительной экспой, с дополнительным оружием, с дополнительными хелсами у базы. Но все это дроч, дроч, дроч и череда бессмесленных поражений.\n\nДа, и про "ролевую систему". Пушек всего пять: пистолет (слабый, медленный, но далеко стреляет), пулемет (мощнее пистолета, но стреляет на одну клетку короче), снайперка (бьет всю линию, но у стрелка слепая зона в две клетки), дробовик (стреляет буквой "T") и меч (очень крутой, но только по одной клетке). Левелап только повышает статы, судя по всему.\n\nИтого: вместо того, чтобы покупать Hunters of the Dead, можно играть в кости с самим собой. Тот же эффект, только дешевле. Или просто подрочить. Еще веселее, и вообще бесплатно.","August 10, 2015","false","1.5"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","46","11","24","6","0"

Some of the in-game instructions aren't completely clear (I'm still not sure what the gadget shop does), but it doesn't matter since the game itself is so straightforward and basic.\n\nThe only real annoying thing that sort of ruins Hunters of the Dead is the frequency of Dracula encounters. The goal of the game is to kill Dracula, and you'll randomly fight him as you click on buildings. A little too frequently it seems. Dracula is tough and cheap, so its normal to either be too weak to stop him or incapable of damaging him enough as he teleports around. The result is he causes lots of damage.

Please look at some Gameplay footage before buying this!\nThe Minesweeper half is the world map, where you choose which building you will tap for resources. Each building is clearly labeled, so there's absolutely no surprise or excitement from the marginal bonuses that they give you.\nEvery building also has a chance to start a lane defence battle against the undead. Every battle has a small chance to include the final boss, Dracula. If you aren't powerful enough to beat him, he'll do a massive amount of damage to your base (it's game over when it's destroyed). I have even encountered Dracula in my very first fight, in a building that's right across the street from my massive, obviously non-secret base. You know how some board games have a card that ends the game when it's drawn, but there's always a special rule about shuffling to make sure that it isn't right at the top of the deck? Yeah, this game doesn't have that.\n\nSo let's talk about the battles. Undead will start shuffling in from the right, and you'll place troops in the appropriate lanes to shoot them. There's just one big wave of zombies and then the battle's over. Any undead that reach your side of the screen explode and do damage to your base. Sounds like just a lousy Plants vs. Zombies clone, right? But the mechanic that makes this a truly AWFUL PvZ clone is Action Points. Troops start off with only four action points, and it costs two points to deploy anyone in battle. But if you want to move a troop after he's deployed, it costs an action point for each square! I understand that lane defence games aren't really lane defence if they don't limit your ability to switch lanes (check out Samurai Bloodshow on iOS to see a GOOD limited movement system) but this is EXTREMELY restrictive and unfun.\n\nSo now you survived the battle and need to get your troops ready for the next one. The game will gladly let you deploy guys who are one hit away from death into the next fight, but anyone with fewer than two precious action points can't be deployed and is useless to you. And of course troops don't just regenerate action points naturally - no, that would be too easy. They have to be Rested. After ever fight, you have to manually go through your list of soldiers and send the exhausted ones to rest. Seriously. Now, if you've played this game and this doesn't sound accurate to you, it's because there's an Auto-Rest option that's on by default and automatically Rests exhausted soldiers. So why do I keep Auto-Rest off and make extra work for myself? Because Auto-Rested soldiers take their guns with them! Do you know how annoying it is - and what unbelieveably unplaytested, sloppy game design it is - to need to manually trade Bob's shotgun for the awful starting pistol before you order him to go take a nap?

My review is probably worse than the game itself. I admit that my pure judgement is indeed not really helpful.\nI do have somewhat experience (played at least 10000 games, beginning from C-64 and even earlier times) and this one is, in my opinion, still the worst game I ever played, but of course this does not play any role and I should have done this differently.\n\nMy excuses, I wrote my first recommendation whilst being very upset.\n\nAnd I am afraid it is not getting much better as I find it very hard to find the right words for this piece of software.\n\nLet's have a look at the facts.\nI do not need to comment on any technical issues.\nFor this kind of games, any grafix and sound can do.  It is simply not important.\nWhat really matters is the gameplay, fun, sense, however you want to call it.\n\nSo I start on this map and the only option I have is to select any undiscsovered building.\nWhat is my strategy? What kind of building do I select first?\nMaybe it's a good idea to go for these hunter buildings first so that I get more guys and bigger army?\nOr better get some graveyards for faster training?\nThe gun shops are good, no?

Get some coins and die.\nRepeat several times until you can afford those upgrades.\nWith the upgraded hunters etc. you will eventually be able to survive the attacks.\nYou do not have to activate any brain cells however. just drag and drop some hunters on that lanes.\nForget about any strategy, there is not much.\n\nYou can send your hunters to a hopital or to training. You do not know what happens next as this randomness is a bit too random. Maybe to end up with no hunters available. Then you have to watch those sprites moving slowly towards your barricade. Maybe you would like to spend some coins for the "kill all" special. Problem is that you cannot remember which icon is what and there is no explanation after the first time.\n\nWhere is the gameplay, where is the fun?\nI'd rather play "Frogger" from 1981.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/318570/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Hunters of the Dead is a lane defense game featuring an overhead map in which you decide which buildings to capture. No idea why its tagged as a tower defense game. It is set in a steampunk universe in which you are tasked with destroying Dracula and various undead creatures. You will need to build a squad of Hunters to accomplish this and you acquire them by rescuing them from their homes.  They can not continue fighting indefinitely, they will need to rest  after too many battles. It is a neat feature but also a double edged sword. It keeps the game from being too easy but it is also frustrating when you lose the game because half of your troops couldn't be bothered to fight the undead that are about to destroy humanity because they have one more day off work. It doesn't help that each day only goes by once you occupy a building but there is no way of knowing the chances of a random encounter so a lot of the times you will end up having to futilely throw your inexperienced rookies to the slaughter. You are expected to lose time and time again since this game doesn't really have balancing, requiring you to gather up money and upgrade your units and troops for the next play-through.\n\nGameplay consists of trying to keep your Hunters rested and healthy while capturing buildings surrounding your base. Not even sure why they bothered with a base, it doesn't matter if you are fighting on the far edge of the map, if a enemy reaches the end of a lane your base will somehow take damage so it may as well just be called  a health bar. The actual fighting is rather simple you defend 5 lanes with the very small variety of Hunter with certain weapons including a Sniper,  Machinegun, Shotgun, Sword and the basic handgun unit. Those are all the units in this game excluding a certain powerful Swordsman you unlock by gathering enough gold through consecutive deaths. You can use abilities during battles like healing units or destroying enemies but these cost gold you use to be stronger in future playthroughs. Each unit has its own use on the battlefield and none felt useless and they will level up after killing enough enemies gaining extra life and AP points. Action Points are used every time you send a unit to battle and every time you move them between lanes.\n\nThe town is randomly generated every time you play but it doesn't matter much since there are only 6 buildings and the bland gray background never changes. It also only has one very dull map for all the battles which further worsen the feeling of repetition and tedium. Dracula himself shows up randomly and is a very powerful foe but will not take to great a chunk of health if he reaches the end of a lane so it may be wiser to build up your forces more instead of confronting him right away. You should also keep a very close eye on your units AP or you may run into a situation where most of your units are resting and lose the game from a random encounter. Healing a unit doesn't rest his fatigue and resting doesn't heal the unit so if a unit is out of AP and heavily injured he will be out of action for quite some time. Other than that there is not much strategy and mostly consists of dumb luck and how much you have upgraded stuff through previous attempts.\n\nVisuals are not awful or good, they simply do the job and do nothing to stand out. Though all that gray is rather unappealing to look at after a time. Same with music and sound effects, they are just there. User Interface is pretty decent and makes it easy to see how your units are doing and simply clicking on a portfolio of a character lets you make him rest, heal him or equip him all on the same screen. There is one nasty thing about the UI that the devs overlooked, you can't see a section of the health and AP of your unit on the bottom lane due to the healing ability button  covering the bottom part of your unit's bar. That means you don't know how close he is the death and if he has any AP to move before he dies. Animations are all right but if an enemy dies mid attack he continues attacking but does no damage to your unit thankfully, it is a small nitpick but I found it fairly annoying since it can distract you from enemies that are still a threat.\n\nYes, even after all that I still had some fun with it. It is not a bad game but it is seriously lacking in content and quickly grows tedious. Play it for 5 minutes and you will see all it has to offer. All that is left then is to lose time and time again in an effort to upgrade and get a bit further each playthrough. So pretty much the whole game is one huge grindfest to finally have a chance at winning. That in itself wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so bare-bone and repetitive. I would not recommend this game to anybody unless it receives a significant content update in the future or those that got it as a gift and don't want to seem rude by not playing it.","January 24, 2015","false","3.2"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","25","29","0","0"

The randomness in the game pretty much guarantees that no two games will be exactly the same.  Graphics are good enough and very much resemble the ever popular Plants Vs Zombies style.\n\nYou basic goal is to assemble a big and well enough equipped group of warriors to defeat Dracula when you find him, as he is one tough hombre.  Find him by accident too early in the game, and you best stay out of his way, and hope you have enough defense built up to survive his attack.\n\nThe game begins with your base tower in the middle of a dark town that will expand as you explore it.  This town is completely random every time you play the game.  You can click on any building to explore it, and each time take a chance on a "battle" scenario explained below.  There are several different types of buildings that give you different benefits when explored.  For example exploring a house will light it up and give you a new companion to your team, always seeming to start at level 1.  Opening a hospital gives you the ability to heal wounded warriors from battles by sending that warrior "away" for 1-5 turns, each turn being one more click of a building to explore.  Other buildings give you additial defense that you are trying to protect against the undead in the battles, while still other buildings such as gun shops can give your warriors better weapons to fight with.\n\nAny time you click any building, you have what seems to be about a 15% chance of entering a battle against a random number and type of undead creatures, and if lucky (or unlucky enough) you will also find Dracula himself attacking your defenses.  Your goal here on these screens is to prevent the undead zombies, liches, skeletons, and more from beating down your defenses to 0.  This happens in a gameplay style that very much resembles that of Plants Vs Zombies with the baddies coming at you from the right side and you placing your warrior(s) on the left to try and take them down before they reach your wooden spiked fence behind you on the left side of the screen.  Should they get past you, they will die on the spiked fence, but not before taking down your defense total which starts at 200 each game.  They also might kill or wound your warriors you place in the battlefield.  Die, and say so long for good to them.  Wounds can be healed by sending them away for 1 to 5 turns at a hospital, assuming you have uncovered one.\n\nAll in all, a fun little single player challenge that is worth the $5 asking price IMO.  Watch my video above for a better demonstration of how the game plays.\n\nHope this helps you, and good luck should you find Dracula early on!  You'll need it!  ;-)","September 4, 2014","true","3.3"," 57 of 86 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","57","86","2","0"

You really need to read everything the game tells you. It's super duper important you realize that houses closer to your base have easier fights. I think a good strategy is never spend your gold on actual fights, just spend it on the upgrades that carry over. I heard another gripe about having to "grind" out the upgrades but I was able to get every upgrade within 3.3 hours of playtime.

In essence, you need to find and defeat Dracula in a randomly generated map with various buildings that provide your stronghold with soldiers, various bonuses, buffs or weapons. Your soldiers can equip a weapon that has various range, power and limitations, and also need to rest, meaning that some strategic thinking must still be used. Battles take place in a rectangle 5-lane grid Plants vs Zombies style, and just like in PvZ, you need to face off against opponents of various difficulty (with their own range, power, HP and limitations), and eventually defeat Dracula, the final boss.\n\nThe Good:\n1.

Yes, but for me it never became frustratingly obnoxious because I enjoyed the gameplay enough to continue. Eventually you buy up all the skills and beat the game, but probably not much before then.

It is really fun and easy to play, yet still challenging. It's sort of a mashup between FTL and plants vs zombies. You click locations on a city map every turn to unlock power ups with the chance of finding monsters. Eventually you'll run across Dracula and the goal is to kill him.\n\nYour party starts off weak but so do the monsters. As you upgrade your guys the fights get tougher and tougher so you have to make some tactical decisions about deployment strategies. You need to use enough firepower to keep the monsters from crushing your base during one fight but also have enough left over for tomorrow's fight. All the while you have to manage training for experience, turns spend healing and regenerating ability points used for deployment. It seems simple at first but there's really a lot of management going on.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/318570/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","Hunters of the Dead, by Traptics, is a monster hunter, tower defense, rogue-like game. In this game you will start with a base of operations, and a randomized grid of city buildings that will enhance your ability to survive monster attacks. The catch is that the layout is always going to be completely random, as is the times when clearing a section of the city causing a fight to occur. Now of course the biggest and baddest of old school monsters will definitely keep you on your toes through the duration of the game that you can survive, and that of course is Dracula.\n\nGraphically this game defintely gives off the feel of what city buildings in a dark age town terrorized by monsters should look like. There are pieces of the art, especially the battle area, that feel a bit rushed. This also goes with the hero character designs, I feel like they are trying to make a serious game and at the same time try to do a parady of what they are doing, which is really confusing.\n\nThe music in the game definitely gives you the monster hunter vibes. The voices in the game are interesting, it's hard to peg them down. The thing is that voices are randomly given to your units so you never know which of the 4 or 5 voices your units are going to have. Some of the voices get old really fast, others well they just kind of go away after a while because you hear them so often. I will tell you what though, when I hear Dracula speak I do have that instant feeling of dread, probably because I'm about to lose everything in the fight.\n\nThe controls are really simply, its a point and click system, though it is in real time for the battles, so depending on the speed of the enemies you are facing, you either can wait a while or have to move fast, and sometimes you are not going to be fast enough.\n\nThis is your definition of a grind game. You are going to fail completely A LOT of times before you actually feel like you are getting anywhere in the game. One of the cheats that I like to use, to help prolong my game sessions is, when I hear Dracula's speech I immediately exit to the main menu and select the continue option. This will place you back in the game right before you selected that game tile that caused the Dracula attack. Hell if you really want to this is also one hell of a way to avoid fights until you are ready.\n\nSpeaking of ready, this is the biggest qualm I have with the game, your units have a set number of action points. They do not replenish after combat, it takes 2 for them to be entered into combat, and additional ones if you want to move them around in combat. The problem is that when they run out they go and rest. Now there are buildings that you can "gain" that will help keep down the number of rounds you have to rest before a unit comes back, but if your unit was on its last leg, health-wise, its going to be the exact same after resting. So in order to get your unit back to where it needs to be you will have to send them home to rest and then select an amount of turns for the unit to then visit the hospital. This is also the only way to get your units healed.\n\nThere are many buildings in the game, and they are all vital to you surviving. There's the tower which will add to your base's current defensive number. There's the houses which will add a unit to your cause, all of them will be found at level 1.  There are the cemeteries thatare used to train units. There's the goods store, which decreases the amount of turns need for resting a unit. There's the gun store which will give you a randomly selected weapon, that if you have a regular unit will be equipped to them (machine gun, shotgun, sword, sniper rifle). There are hospitals that will help heal your units when they are sent there. Finally there are the gadget stores, which apparently help out your units, but I've never figured out in what way really.\n\nI am going to just tell you right now that I went ahead a played this game over and over again so that I could accumulate the money needed to unlock all the upgrades. You see, an interesting aspect of the game, is that the money you accumulate in game sticks around even after a complete defeat. Now after you have unlocked everything, you are going to find that the game is still probably going to chew you up and spit you out. In my opinion there's so much micro-managing and guessing that the fun gets sucked out. There's also a ton of questions that are felt while playing this game. The main one is, why the hell is it that when I'm 6 buildings away from my base I'm magically attacked at my base? Should I have not been able to detect the enemies moving towards my base and maybe plan accordingly so I'm not left with a single level 1 unit and everyone else is off training, resting, or healing? There's also the question, that crept into my mind after way too many playthroughs of, is this game actually beatable? I have tried my best to gear up for a Dracula attack, and I'm going to be honest, I don't think it is possible to survive and kill him. Sure there's the chance his hit on your base doesn't take you to zero, but to actually kill the warping all over the battlefield, Prince of Darkness, I just don't see it.\n\nThis is an interesting game, and there's a lot there that will have you coming back, trying different things, and hoping that the city layout will help you survive long enough to have units strong enough to take on all that will be dished out, but in the end there's just too many frustrating pieces for this game to contain the entertaining aspects of this game. So with that I have to give this game a 7.4 out of 10.","October 9, 2014","true","5.0"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","7"

Didn't think so.)  Much like in life, you start with a single building.  Around you, fading into the distance, more buildings.  I'll be honest, in 1.7 hours I still don't know what they all do.  Some of them give you people, some give you guns.  The rest?  What am I, an FAQ?\n\nYou click where you want and things change color.  Sometimes weird monsters come at you and you have to defend humanity, Plants vs Zombies style.  You'll lose.  Sometimes the very first thing you click on ends the game.  At the end of the game you get points you can spend to upgrade how you start.  More people, better guns, things and stuff.\n\nStaying alive the first few clicks becomes easier the more times you fail the human race.  Eventually, you'll have 30+ buildings under your control, a huge army, tons of weapons.  You'll feel tough.  Then you'll click on something and all your people will decide they're sleepy and you get to watch as a horde of smug looking monsters walk from right to left unopposed so they can show you a game over screen.\n\nThis review would not be complete without mentioning the teleporting Dracula.  Randomly he appears on the battlefield, warping from place to place.  Don't bother deploying troops to stop him, as he warps behind them and that's about it.\n\nIt is a fun game in it's way.  I can't see someone putting dozens of hours in to it, but for $5 it's a fun couple of plays.  It's on sale as I write this.  $1.24.  Less than a cup of coffee, unless you get that 99 cent stuff at a gas station.  Which there isn't anything wrong with, mind you.

It is really good though, I got it on sale and have been very pleased.  It's kind of like plants vs zombies as far as gameplay, but has much less variation in units you control. They do however add new and unique elements to it to make it not simply a boring clone of pvz which is what a lot of these games turn out to be.\n\nThe game does require a whole lot of luck in order to beat it. You are not going to beat this early on, not until you have played and died tons of times. Not until you have played and built up enough gold in order to add global upgrades for all new games. It's good and bad in that sense, it makes it not too easy or short, but also a bit frustrating that it is almost impossible early on. I saw one review that said you don't run into monsters that often, but I seem to get attacked 1 out of every 2 or 3 moves that I make.  Part of winning is just pure luck that you click on a spot and simply don't get attacked during the round your players are resting. If you run into an attack your first 3/4 or 5 clicks it's going to be tough b/c your guys will be resting and you can't do anything which just lets your village get destroyed. You could also start off and not get attacked for 6 turns in a row with time to build up a nice army. This randomness gives me so many mixed feelings on this game. I have had several games that I run into dracula on my 2nd or 3rd enemy encounter and then it's either game over or nearly game over.\n\nOverall the game is good enough to get a thumbs up and is worth what I paid, but with a few tweaks it could of been a great game which I would of preferred over PvZ. It would be better if they added a system where you only run into an enemy every so many turns or showing you have certain turns which you know you won't hit an enemy, maybe even a ladder type system where you climb your way up while still having the town. Also, not being able to run into certain mobs unless your so far out from the center of town would be good too. I can't figure out the system in which the type of enemies spawn. I can sometimes select all the squares near the start then move outwards and run into very tough mobs a bit later on. Other times if I skip some closer squares then hit them just a little bit later all of a sudden its a crazy tough mob, then when I click the square far away it's a super weak mob.\n\nThere needs to be some kind of system other than what appears to be just 100% pure randomness with everything involved. You can even keep it being random if they had something where after a preset # of turns you take then brings a new enemy type into the mix. So that you know for 100% that within your first 5 turns you won't have a chance of running into tougher mobs. Then at 10 turns a new enemy type will randomly appear in the mix as well. It just needs some order to it to go from good / ok to great.","December 23, 2014","true","9.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","2"

Most titles feel like they've given all they had to you in mere minutes into the game. So, to my welcome surprise, this is a first one that has kept me coming back.\n\nIts gameplay is simple. Discover, expand and fight off waves after waves of the undead horde. And though it sounds simplistic, there are many a cases where you will feel overwhelmed by the number of choices you are going to make. To this, the randomly generated map and encounters contribute immensely. You could start off fine only to find your options getting limited or work it the other way around. Each and every press of the "New Game" button is guaranteed to give you a new, refreshing experience. It may frustrate you before you manage to get some upgrades running, but as you build up with upgrades you will get the hang of it leading you to make progress into it.\n\nThe graphics as well as the sound effects compliment it completely. They are not the technology of today's finest edge, but you don't expect that from an indie title. Instead, they are colourful, pretty and just enough to get you immersed into the game. The soundtracks don't feel loopy and the voice-acting on the characters is simply sweet!\n\nAll in all, this is my humble opinion but at the price you're getting this, it's a bargain. It's a very nice title. sure to pay off many hours of immersion and the way I see it, it's also a form of investment.

There's an upgrade section where you can spend your gold to become stronger for your next run. My advice is to try and get all the gold you can at the start, buy all the upgrades and then put your tactician cap on.\n\nThe main view acts as a board game where you click on different buildings that provide you with resources. However, each building has the potential to go into a battle to shoot down horror inspired villains.\n\nThe game lacks polish with no resolution options and outdated graphics. There's not much content in this overall package, but being a permadeath game, I can understand why. I still would like to see more classes, upgrades, enemy types and a better UI experience.

Each hunter only has a linited number of action points before they have to be rested and made inactive, they can also be replenished if you find resources to do so. while this is a nice idea in principle you can not skip a turn as such when a hunter is rested for AP or in hospital you still have to explore and each time you explore there is a risk of an encounter and if theres no active hunter or you lack AP then your base gets ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nOn principle all this sounds ok and it is ... sort of. as you play you earn points, these points can be used during battles to heal your hunters, kill all mobs on screen, as an xp boost etc, however these points are also the some points that are used to buy upgrades on the main menu that carry over all future games, such as starting with more hunters, increased starting level of hunters, better and more starting guns, strong base defences etc.\n\nNow heres the key gripe, the game is impossible to beat without significant investment in these upgrades, you simply grind the game to get the points to purchase all the upgrades from the main menu and then once done you play your final playthrough and complete the game.\n\nThere are no high score tables, no achievements to earn and as such little point in playing the game beyond earning trading cards.\n\nAs stated by others this feels very much like a freemium mobile game and I'm such it would have been a reasonable concept for it however asking £3.99 for this game when there are alternatives like Rebuild and Rebuild 2 available to play for free on the web paying for this game just does not make any sense.\n\nThere is no story, and no challange or reward for wanting to play this game any further, each time you play you'll earn points towards and upgrade and with each upgrade you will last that bit longer untill you have purchased enough upgrades to last long enough to complete the game and then thats it, the end.\n\nDev Feedback -\nAdd a high score table\nMake it so that hunters can move to anywhere on the board with one move not just one square up/down/left/right\nSeperate points used for ingame battle bonuses and menu upgrades\n\n\n***EDIT***\n\nWell after a few more hours of playthrough I am about to "complete" the game having obtained all upgrades and it's fair to say it has even more issues. The UI is too big and you can not zoom out far enough, once you explore 4 or 5 buildings away from your base buildings appear obstructed by the UI and even off the screen and are in accessable, it is entirely possible to break the game by running out of buildings to expore on screen if you do not kill the boss before doing so. Either needs a higher res which is not adjustable in game or ability to zoom out further.\n\n\n***EDIT#2***\nHaving just completed the game and a little late to find out you can move the screen around holding LMB down and moving mouse, something that could have perhaps been mentioned somewhere as it is kind of important.","January 12, 2015","false","3.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It's a conceptually interesting game, and all of the pieces are there. When they work together correctly the game can be a lot of fun. It is unfortunate then, that the game tends to be more a jumbled mess of interesting ideas than a coherent whole.\n\nYou start out with a few wannabe vampire hunters and begin taking the city back from those bloodsuckers. Combat plays out like plants versus zombies, except your vampire hunters don't have nearly the range or the firepower to really hold their own, even when they have the upgraded weapons. There's a leveling system in place that makes them slightly more formidable but the enemies still seem vastly overpowered.\n\nIt's also often impossible to tell which lane the enemies are coming down so planning for them all to come from one area and having them all come from the other is soul crushing, especially since moving your soldiers around is unnecessarily hard. The combat isn't terrible, and I did enjoy it when I felt like I had struck the right balance, but that happened far less often than it should have.\n\nLet's talk about the cocky piece of crap Dracula. He'll show up basically at any time and screw up your day. This is by far the games most terrible offense. It's basically impossible to kill him with your starting crew, yet he can show up and ♥♥♥♥ up their day within the first few encounters. He'll keep showing up to, and he does considerable damage to your fort if he makes it past your team.\n\nPretty much every time I've lost its because he showed up and wrecked my undergeared soldiers.\n\nHealing your soldiers is arduous because they're sent away to the hospital for long periods of time. I could accept that on its own but the amount of time versus the healing done is atrocious in a game where its all about how many men you can field rather than something more tactical like X-Com where a few soldiers CAN pull off the seemingly impossible. Having half your team out of the fight when a big encounter comes up makes you want to throw your keyboard.\n\nThere's a lot of cool stuff here, but none of it is applied all that well. There are four weapon types, only two of which I found useful. The enemies are cool in concept but vastly overpowered and often times spawning in such great numbers that a full squadron can simply not kill them fast enough. Like I said, I really want to like this game. There are times when I had fun, but I don't think I can reccomend this when there are better alternatives out there.\n\nI give it a 5.5/10","April 1, 2015","false","5.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

So much of this game relies on the roll of the dice that you cannot even begin to have enough skill to win. You're supposed to build up your forces from game to game with the upgrades, but that requires that you actually win fights. While you can 'win' fights, you can't even begin to do well.

Она использует механику Plants vs Zombies, но при этом тут мало контроля над набором "башенок". Это не рогалик тоже, потому что игра полагается ТОЛЬКО на рандом.\n\nСуть такая. Город, который нужно защитить от Дракулы. Дракула насылает на город нежить. Нужно защитить последнюю базу сопротивления от нежити и по возможности убить Дракулу. Вот-с.\nНа карте города разбросаны дома. В некоторых прячутся выжившие, их можно завербовать в качестве охотников на вампиров. В некоторых расположены оружейные магазинчики. Не стрелять же бойцам из ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥енького пистолета всю жизнь, правда? Есть аптеки, которые ускоряют выздоровление героев, есть пивнушки, куда бегут отдыхать уставшие бойцы, есть магазины и кладбища, дающие бонусные деньги и экспу для персонажей.\n\nЗдания открываются по очереди. Кликнули на одно - бонус. На второе кликнули - бонус. На третье - ой, на нас напааалии.\n\nИ вот здесь включается боевка. Клеточки, как в PvZ, по ним шагают зомби-скелеты, как в PvZ, на их пути расставляем бойцов из заначки. В зависимости от того, какое оружие парни выловили в оружейных магазинах (чистый рандом, повлиять никак нелья), у них изменяется площадь атаки. В отличие от PvZ, сколько у нас бойцов есть, столько мы выставить и сможем. Они еще могут сместиться на пару клеток, если пунктов выносливости хватает, но не более того.\nОчевидный вопрос: а может ли случиться так, что нападающих будет больше, чем защитников? Ну, мало ли, может убьют кого, что тогда делать?\n\nА вот и главная проблема. Да, количество зомбаков МОЖЕТ быть больше, чем герои смогут сдержать. Игроку может просто не повезти на выживших, может Дракула со своими войсками объявится на втором ходе, а может у солдат закончится выносливость (примерно три пункта на брата, один тратится за высадку во время боя и еще по одному за каждое перемещение), и тогда они пойдут бухать всей толпой. Кто останется драться? Может вообще никого не остаться. Зомби будут маршировать свободно.\nДойдут до конца поля - снимут у базы немного здоровья. Здоровье дойдет до нуля - ну, вы понимаете.\n\nТеоретически таких неприятных ситуаций можно избежать. Допустим, повезет найти кучу народа, и кучу пивнушек для них, чтобы они отдыхали быстрее, а еще отспавнится куча старых фортификаций, которые можно разобрать на кирпичи для базы. А может и не повезти, тут чистый рандом. Каждый - абсолютно каждый - ход может закончиться дракой. Количество нападающих предугадать тоже непросто. Более того, время от времени вылезает сам Дракула. Он быстро движется, телепортируется с клетки на клетку и в драке 1 на 1 может закошмарить любого охотника. Если пройдет, то врежет по штаб-квартире в три раза больнее, чем любой монстр.\n\nЧтобы игра не казалась такой уж несправедливой, в игре есть четыре пауэрапа, которые можно активровать на вырученные за победы (если таковые будут) деньги: можно дать солдатам двойную экспу после боя, вылечить всех, добавить огневой мощи или убрать всех врагов (кроме Дракулы) с поля. Или - все золотишко сохраняется после поражения - можно в стартовом меню купить парочку бустов: стартовать с дополнительными наемниками, с дополнительной экспой, с дополнительным оружием, с дополнительными хелсами у базы. Но все это дроч, дроч, дроч и череда бессмесленных поражений.\n\nДа, и про "ролевую систему". Пушек всего пять: пистолет (слабый, медленный, но далеко стреляет), пулемет (мощнее пистолета, но стреляет на одну клетку короче), снайперка (бьет всю линию, но у стрелка слепая зона в две клетки), дробовик (стреляет буквой "T") и меч (очень крутой, но только по одной клетке). Левелап только повышает статы, судя по всему.\n\nИтого: вместо того, чтобы покупать Hunters of the Dead, можно играть в кости с самим собой. Тот же эффект, только дешевле. Или просто подрочить. Еще веселее, и вообще бесплатно.","August 10, 2015","false","1.5"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","46","11","24","6","0"

Definitely one of those easy to learn, difficult to master sorts of things. Some of the in-game instructions aren't completely clear (I'm still not sure what the gadget shop does), but it doesn't matter since the game itself is so straightforward and basic.\n\nThe only real annoying thing that sort of ruins Hunters of the Dead is the frequency of Dracula encounters. The goal of the game is to kill Dracula, and you'll randomly fight him as you click on buildings. A little too frequently it seems. Dracula is tough and cheap, so its normal to either be too weak to stop him or incapable of damaging him enough as he teleports around. The result is he causes lots of damage. Even after buying out all the powerups and wiping the floor with the normal enemies, Dracula continues to ruin my day as I seemingly can't avoid the somebeatch and I'm never strong enough to kill him.\n\nDespite how difficult it is to beat, Hunters of the Dead is stupidly addicting and fun (if annoying).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tartrazine/recommended/318570/","tartrazine","Tartrazine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tartrazine/","1509 products in account","This game is a bad mix of Minesweeper and Plants vs. Zombies. Please look at some Gameplay footage before buying this!\nThe Minesweeper half is the world map, where you choose which building you will tap for resources. Each building is clearly labeled, so there's absolutely no surprise or excitement from the marginal bonuses that they give you.\nEvery building also has a chance to start a lane defence battle against the undead. Every battle has a small chance to include the final boss, Dracula. If you aren't powerful enough to beat him, he'll do a massive amount of damage to your base (it's game over when it's destroyed). I have even encountered Dracula in my very first fight, in a building that's right across the street from my massive, obviously non-secret base. You know how some board games have a card that ends the game when it's drawn, but there's always a special rule about shuffling to make sure that it isn't right at the top of the deck? Yeah, this game doesn't have that.\n\nSo let's talk about the battles. Undead will start shuffling in from the right, and you'll place troops in the appropriate lanes to shoot them. There's just one big wave of zombies and then the battle's over. Any undead that reach your side of the screen explode and do damage to your base. Sounds like just a lousy Plants vs. Zombies clone, right? But the mechanic that makes this a truly AWFUL PvZ clone is Action Points. Troops start off with only four action points, and it costs two points to deploy anyone in battle. But if you want to move a troop after he's deployed, it costs an action point for each square! I understand that lane defence games aren't really lane defence if they don't limit your ability to switch lanes (check out Samurai Bloodshow on iOS to see a GOOD limited movement system) but this is EXTREMELY restrictive and unfun.\n\nSo now you survived the battle and need to get your troops ready for the next one. The game will gladly let you deploy guys who are one hit away from death into the next fight, but anyone with fewer than two precious action points can't be deployed and is useless to you. And of course troops don't just regenerate action points naturally - no, that would be too easy. They have to be Rested. After ever fight, you have to manually go through your list of soldiers and send the exhausted ones to rest. Seriously. Now, if you've played this game and this doesn't sound accurate to you, it's because there's an Auto-Rest option that's on by default and automatically Rests exhausted soldiers. So why do I keep Auto-Rest off and make extra work for myself? Because Auto-Rested soldiers take their guns with them! Do you know how annoying it is - and what unbelieveably unplaytested, sloppy game design it is - to need to manually trade Bob's shotgun for the awful starting pistol before you order him to go take a nap? The other management options are similarly sloppy (You're shown rougly how much health a soldier will regain if you send him to hospital, but not how much health he's missing!) but the action point system is what absolutely ruins this otherwise mediocre game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbrc8i4i0nA","December 9, 2014","false","5.9"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","0"

You start the game and see a house. you'll click on the house and get something. Cool! What now? Well click on another house. Suddenly the screen turns red. A battle starts :O.  Wait i only have 1 soldier and there are 6 zombies. I lose the battle. I repeat the process 3 times. I lost the game.\n\nThat's the game in a nutshell.

My review is probably worse than the game itself. I admit that my pure judgement is indeed not really helpful.\nI do have somewhat experience (played at least 10000 games, beginning from C-64 and even earlier times) and this one is, in my opinion, still the worst game I ever played, but of course this does not play any role and I should have done this differently.\n\nMy excuses, I wrote my first recommendation whilst being very upset.\n\nAnd I am afraid it is not getting much better as I find it very hard to find the right words for this piece of software.\n\nLet's have a look at the facts.\nI do not need to comment on any technical issues.\nFor this kind of games, any grafix and sound can do.  It is simply not important.\nWhat really matters is the gameplay, fun, sense, however you want to call it.\n\nSo I start on this map and the only option I have is to select any undiscsovered building.\nWhat is my strategy? What kind of building do I select first?\nMaybe it's a good idea to go for these hunter buildings first so that I get more guys and bigger army?\nOr better get some graveyards for faster training?\nThe gun shops are good, no? You probably can get one of those sniper rifles that really help you much in your further battles.\nDoes it even matter? No.\nJust click somewhere. Get some coins and die.\nRepeat several times until you can afford those upgrades.\nWith the upgraded hunters etc. you will eventually be able to survive the attacks.\nYou do not have to activate any brain cells however. just drag and drop some hunters on that lanes.\nForget about any strategy, there is not much.\n\nYou can send your hunters to a hopital or to training. You do not know what happens next as this randomness is a bit too random. Maybe to end up with no hunters available. Then you have to watch those sprites moving slowly towards your barricade. Maybe you would like to spend some coins for the "kill all" special. Problem is that you cannot remember which icon is what and there is no explanation after the first time.\n\nWhere is the gameplay, where is the fun?\nI'd rather play "Frogger" from 1981. Crossing the street without getting killed. This is fun.\n\nThere are a lot of indi developers out there that do most of the time a really good job.\nIt's your call.","September 14, 2014","false","2.6"," 21 of 50 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","21","50","0","8"
