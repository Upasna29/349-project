The graphics are cartoony but nice. But, then, you're not playing a poker game for the graphics. And when it starts to get a little slow (waiting for each player to decide), you can increase the game speed and start cranking out several hands per minute.\n\nIf you're a poker player and a fan of casual games, this is worth checking out.","February 19, 2014","true","33.5"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","37","40","2","0"

I've played it before via demos etc. It's a good mix of poker and goal-oriented objectives. It isn't repetitive if you like to play poker, it's a nice break from pokerstars/whatever online poker you play. Only downside is there's no online lobby or whatever - but if you have a handful of minutes and you want to play poker against a computer then this is a radical game.","May 11, 2014","true","21.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

I'm a fan of both poker and city management games, so I thought this would be right up my alley. It probably would be a great game, except for one thing; bad AI. The other players don't play at all like real people. They will "check" the whole game while they have a straight flush. And it almost NEVER fails that one of these idiots will raise the bet by 50-80% before the flop. They are impossible to bluff, too. I have sat down and tried to play this game three separate times, with three different strategies. Every time it has ended in frustration and anger. That is not how a game is supposed to make you feel, not EVERY time.\n\nI also feel that it is relevant to note that I have played a lot of different poker games (I'll estimate around 20) and this one has BY FAR the WORST AI.","November 29, 2015","false","3.1"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

It get's pretty boring and repetitive. You make no money at all from owning towns which is dumb. Also there is clearly programmed for bad beats and luck. Never seen so much fluke, or people tripping pocker pairs, and I ran into a guy who got pocket aces 3 out of 4 hands. Also ran into a guy who got pocket Aces, then pocket queens, then pocket kings, all in a row.

They will rarely try to pull any fancy moves. If you wanna try to get better at pot odds, value betting and playing passively; look no further. If you can't understand what I mentioned, skip this game because it will bore you. I compare this game as playing againts microstakes irl players. If you are beyond this level, you should probably play the real thing. I imagine this game would have been great practice back in the dumb days of poker.\n\nAgain, it's an ok practice tool for someone that wants to get better at the math behind beginner poker. 5/10 will play for fun. 7/10 will play for practice. 10/10 will find better tools for free to learn basic poker.\n","January 26, 2015","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
