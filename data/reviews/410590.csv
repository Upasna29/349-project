What was the cheapest, most horrible, game I could find on Steam just to get a laugh?  While there are probably worse games, this one at $.049 is a pretty good contender.  Ultimately, since most people are not trying to find the worst games they can, I will non-rec this game.  If you want a terrible laugh then go ahead and get it.\n\nGameplay:\n\nWell, it's your run of the mill, early 90's, overhead, sneak around avoiding traps with completely miscalibrated mouse movement in a stupidly difficult level type of game.  We all know them, right?  Sadly, the awesome voice acting stopped and at least as far as I've made it so far (Level 7) it hasn't been back.  I can only hope any further efforts will reward me with another clip of that script.  Luckily, on each level there seems to be at least one or two places you can squeeze behind the poorly-placed obstacles and completely avoid the level all together.  In fact, that is about the only way I think it's probably even possible to score the times they require to get the gold trophies.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention there's a trophy system.  Each level has pre-determined times to get Gold, Silver, Bronze, or...Wood.  I've got lots of wood!\n\nAs expected, the game is not very good.  But.....I did play it longer than I expected and it kept me wanting to come back for more just so I could say I beat the next level.  Kind of a masochistic one more turn syndrome.  If the mouse actually controlled acurrately, it wouldn't be so terrible.  At full price it's a dollar, so you get what you pay for.  Having paid even less than that I can honestly say, despite it's numerous, glaring, faults, it occupied me enough to be worth the spare change I find under my car seat.  Throw in the humor derived from it's utter failure at being a serious game and it might even be worth $0.60.\n\nDid I mention the script is a barely veiled attempt at suggesting you are sneaking into Gitmo to free the captives?  Not sure why all the walls in the place are biohazard or radiation symbols.  I suppose that is the developers way to remind us all that the prison is controlled by the evil nuclear superpower.\n\nIf you are pondering whether to check this game out, you must ask yourself one thing.  Are you ready to go to hell and back with Randy Crow?","January 4","false","0.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I'm not kidding.\nI bought it for 15 cents and got 24 cents for selling the trading cards.\nSo I made 9 cents profit!\n\nAnd even though I got payed, it still wasnt worth it.\n(You can say, that for this price its okay, BUT my question is, why is this on steam? No offense, but many flash games are better :/ )\nThis game looks horrible, it's basic vectors copy pasted and a few low resolution textures.\nThe text has a horrible font and is hard to read.\n\nThe Controls are funky as hell, dont even think about using the keyboard (there is a option to switch between mouse/keyboard) and the Gameplay is repetitive and well..\n\nBoring.\nAll your doing all game, is stopping, then moving. Stopping. Moving. Stopping. Moving Stopping. Moving. Stopping. Moving. Stopping. Moving Stopping. Moving. Stopping. Moving. Stopping. Moving Stopping. Moving. Stoppin.. You get the point.\nThe hit detection is off, it feels like you "die" most of time due to some small millimeters. This makes it insanly difficult.\n\nBut not the kind of fun difficulty like in Dark Souls, no here its just completly destatisfying and ruins the fun you could get.\n\nIts also very easy to just skip some of the levels, due to a "Bug", which allows you to wiggle through some of the spaces between boxes. Too bad that bug isnt in every level, or I might have just finished it. I flew through the first 6 levels in the first 2 minutes and then was stuck in the first 5 seconds of level 7 for the next 20 mins. Needless to say I stopped playing.\n\nOnly get this game, if its worth selling the trading cards for a profit.\nDont try playing it, just idle.\nI just saved your life with that tip.","January 30","false","29.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The first thing you will likely notice is that you move awkwardly, partly due to using the mouse to move yourself instead of WASD, and partly because it doesn't seem to be very accurate. Your objective is to get to the manhole at the end of each stage while avoiding cameras, lasers, noise detectors, etc. If you are caught the level restarts for you to try again. While the game might have a low price of only $1, you can find better made and better looking free flash games.\n\n-10 / 10","February 26","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
