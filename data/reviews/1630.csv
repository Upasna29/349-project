"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Somnambuls/recommended/1630/","Somnambuls","D.Cosmos [lv]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Somnambuls/","233 products in account","I think this actually was the first PC game that I have ever played (well apart from those pre-installed games on Windows XP like Solitaire). I enjoyed it back in the days. I still do.\n\nDisciples II is a turn-based strategy game with beautiful graphics (even for today) and rich storyline. Unlike other turn-based strategy titles like Heroes, the battle system offers a control over individual units instead of stacked units, which I find very convenient. Also the different strategies you can use to complete a map and the rich storyline guarantees that the gameplay does not get repetitive as it is with Heroes of Might and Magic.\n\nIn Disciples II, you get to choose from five different races (Elves, Humans, Dwarfes, Demons and Undeads) with their own unique agendas and characteristics. Also you can choose one of three classes for yourself as a strategist: Mage (cast spells twice a day), Warlord (restore Health more quickly) or Guildmaster (more resources and actions for the Thief). So when you've completed game with one race/leader class you can try another.\n\nThis game offers three elements of gaming experience that I value the most: great style, rich storyline and character development/customization. Also, this game rewards exploring and there are plenty of quest maps to try after the campaign mode is complete.\n\nWhat I didn't like about this game however was that you can export only one leader and only five items to the next campaign, so lot of valuable equipment is lost in the process. Also I didn't like that only a particular development branch could be chosen for a unit class instead of them all. Also, the Multiplayer via Directplay does not work anymore. I guess, you need to try external services like GameRanger for that.\n\nNevertheless, Disciples II is a great classic turn-based strategy game. My overall rating is 10/10.\n\np.s. Don't believe other reviews. This game works on Windows 8.1 like a charm. I had some issues with fullscreen on my laptop (I had to choose a lower resolution, otherwise the game won't fit the screen), but with external monitor there are no problems at all.","August 26, 2014","true","51.7"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","17","18","2","0"

I am Muzday!\nListen: if you haven't played this game so far, you had lost a lot of fun! Okay, not fun but a lot of gothic.  It impregnates every part of this game: from the design of cities till the soundtrack. I can say with certainty that this game has a strange magical atmosphere, it absorbs all your attention and makes you spend several hours in front of your screen per day, ending turns, fighting the battles with their unique style and develop your squads as you want. After you begin playing, you will notice that you are ready to stroke your soldiers like favourite pets if it will make them to beat enemies more precisely!\nIn general, the only thing I can tell about this game is:\nIf you are looking for a classic and unusual strategy game with a wonderful design, gloomy soundtrack, unrepeatable gothic atmosphere and five different playable races, this game is for you and it is worth your attention!\nP.S.\nMy first review =)","January 17, 2014","true","25.1"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","24","33","0","0"

It is a turn based strategy that has many fun features. The story and lore is actually really good and makes logical sense, so that is also nice. I don't have to much to say about this game, so lets go ahead with the pros and cons list.\n\nPros-\n\nGood Story/Lore, I enjoyed playing the campaigns through, and they are all very nice.\n\nDifficulty, it isn't to hard playing it on normal, but playing it on hard can be a bit rough.\n\nCombat, much like Disciples 1, this game has a unique combat style, somewhat like a turn based. The combat is fun and I don't get the repetative boredom effect after playing this game a lot.\n\nMusic/Audio, the music is very good, very rememberable.\n\nTutorial, the tutorial is actually pretty good, unlike other games like these. The tutorial doesn't feel intrusive but also provides you the information you need to properly play the game, which is nice.\n\nCons-\n\nGraphics, although the game itself is dated, which I understand, some of the graphics themselves don't look very good. I can't say to many bad things about them, they have really good points as well.\n\nRepetativeness, the game can be seen as repetative after a while, especially if you are having a hard time getting past a certain stage.\n\nTime, the stages actually take quite a bit of time, but I guess that is why they have the save function. One problem I have is I would prefer to start and finish something in one sitting, so this may or may not be a problem for you.\n\nConclusion-\nOverall, I really enjoy this game. It is similar to the Might&Magic series, but personally I think that Disciples has a much better story. I believe that the lore in video games is almost as important as the game itself, I guess that is the Game Master in me. Anyway, Disciples II: Rise of the Elves is definitely a fun game that I highly recommend.\n\nMay your adventures be many and always end in reward!\n-Donoknight, Founder of Tabletop RPG Gamers League","July 21, 2015","true","10.2"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","5"

However: the game may not boot up properly all the time, leaving it just a dark screen and you needing to CTL+ALT+Delete and close the game and try and reopen it again.\nAlright. The game it's self is a lot of fun, the design and themes make up a lot of the appeal. The gameplay it's self is still very fun if you enjoy turn-based fighting, though it's not terribly unique in the combat area. It's a lot of fun to level up your units and build your structures to choose the path your units level up into. There are 5 races to play, and if you've come across Disciples II: Gallean's Return on here I don't recommend buying that because this game is the same game but with more content and it's the same price. I made the mistake of buying both this game and that game (though thankfully they're cheap games). Edit: The game also comes with an EXTREMELY versatile level editor. You can make your own quests or campaigns and involve advanced AI and events with extremely intricate triggers and it is REALLY easy to do so.","August 12, 2014","true","202.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Most of the time it look like this: you play your main hero for the whole campaign and the rest of you heroes are only thieves and rod planters.","July 11, 2014","true","6.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There's great variety between the races and each has their own campaign, with each faction having a distinct style. The combat is unique and feels like Ogre Battle but this is also one of it's biggest problems; similarly to Ogre Battle, if all of your units in a party die, they are gone forever. Your favorite hero and his units will transfer between missions so this means if one of your super-units dies you can potentially throw the campaign. The terrain control mechanic is a great visual representation of your area control but I find it downplayed in many missions because of a turn limit or boss rush. Hero customization is diverse and has more options than HoMM but they are slower to level up. Although it has aged poorly, this is a great HoMM alternative that is worth checking out if you're a fan of strategy games.","December 13, 2012","true","25.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

The changes are just what you would expect. A new campaign playing as the elves with the appropriate capital, buildings, units and spells.\n\nIf you haven't played a Disciples game before I highly recommend playing Sacred Lands and Disciples II first as it will give you greater context for the world and the races in it. If you have played the other games you know what to expect already. Disciples II: Rise of the Elves doesn't do anything particularly new but expands on an already solid formula. Richly detailed artwork and music help to immerse you in a dark fantasy world.

Very easy for new players, very challenging for experienced players. The game does lack a bit of overall strategy though and relies a bit on steamrolling the map with one or two parties, and can be a bit "grindy" in the first 20 turns.

Let's start off back in the years of 2003/2004 where my brother aquired this game through a friend, he, along with myself, started playing the game on one of our old CPU's in our house. We rarley tried multiplayer and instead relied soley on the singleplayer campaign where I cheated extensivly at first (stairwaytoheaven is one of the best cheats ever thank you stratagy first) however after a while I started to play the game fully. I kept playing the game and over a few years our computers upgraded and eventually the game didnt become compatible anymore. I was unaware of the wide variety of questions I ask google at this time so I wrote it off as losing one of my fave games of all time. Years later I am playing this game, on steam, on my windows 8 laptop and it is still as amazing as it ever was.\n\nLets start off with the fact that this is a standalone expansion pack, it does not require the normal game to play.\nIs this better than the original? well, it contains everything the original has and more so i'd say yes.\nThis game allows you to play as 5 different races with unique units, buildings and combat styles. Dwarves are slow but powerful and require you to be able to take hits before you can deal them out, the undead are frail but do great damage to opposing units and are able to paralyze individual units almost crippling entire armies, the human empire is fast and furious but fairly frail and require constant healing to stay alive. Each of them has a unique campaign and each of them are great in thier own way (go dwarves though).\n\nI could go on about how smoothly the gameplay runs, how the spell sytem works and how the variation of upgrades allows me to replay the game hundreds of times. But, instead I will ask you, as a favour to me, buy this game, it is amazing. They did sort of screw up the 3rd game in the series but the 1st and second, and especially this stand-alone expansion are amazing games, and you should get it!","October 12, 2015","true","23.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The changes are just what you would expect. A new campaign playing as the elves with the appropriate capital, buildings, units and spells.\n\nIf you haven't played a Disciples game before I highly recommend playing Sacred Lands and Disciples II first as it will give you greater context for the world and the races in it. If you have played the other games you know what to expect already. Disciples II: Rise of the Elves doesn't do anything particularly new but expands on an already solid formula. Richly detailed artwork and music help to immerse you in a dark fantasy world. If you are a Disciples fan this is a worthwhile addition to the series and one that ultimately gives you more of what you love.","July 22, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
