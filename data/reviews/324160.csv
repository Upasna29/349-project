"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aspirety/recommended/324160/","aspirety","Aspirety","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aspirety/","244 products in account","CLANNAD is one of the most well-regarded visual novels in the world, boasting an epic 80-120 hours of content; about twice the size of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It starts off at a very slow pace with lots of light-hearted comedy, but once you begin getting involved with each of the characters' individual conflicts, the story ramps up into some gripping emotional storytelling, sometimes sprinkled with a tinge of supernatural intrigue. The character routes are very worthwhile in their own right, but the true value of CLANNAD is to be found in its final route: After Story. It doesn't matter how emotionally hardened you think you are; After Story will hit you like a sledgehammer with its relentless emotional impact, and you won't come out unscathed.\n\nSo, yeah, CLANNAD is kinda cool.

After a year of anticipation and throwing almost all my money at the Kickstarter campaign, our beloved Clannad is here! All you VN lovers should already know that Clannad is a universally-acclaimed masterpiece. But for those who don't know much (or anything) about it, know this: it's one hell of a rollercoaster ride. Clannad will have you laughing, crying, happy, angry, and a whole slew of other emotions. In fact, Clannad (both the anime series and the VN) is the only story that has truly made me empathize with the characters and relate to it in my own life. I dare say it to be a life-changing experience if you open your heart.\n\nWhile Clannad is almost always described as a romance game, there is so much more than that. While there is a lot of romantic material, Clannad offers an endless ocean of life lessons around family, friends, overcoming hardship, making excruciating decisions, dealing with change, and much more. Clannad really made me take a deep look into my own life and helped me overcome many personal barriers relating to my own family and friends. It has positively influenced my outlook in many areas of my life and I will forever be grateful for it.\n\nEven if you don't think you would enjoy it much, do yourself a favor and pick it up. And if you already previously played it, buy it on Steam! Compared to the original Full Voice version, it has so many new enhancements that warrant playing it again (as if the story alone wasn't enough!). The HD assets, Steam achievements, and Dangopedia are all big bonuses to me. The only things missing are trading cards and emoticons.\n\nAnd lastly, join the Clannad steam group for all your Clannad needs! We're active and very friendly and love discussing all things Clannad (as well as other games, anime, etc.). You could say we're Steam's very own Big Dango Family! Also, if you ever want to talk about Clannad, feel free to friend/message me!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/azusa_twin/recommended/324160/","azusa_twin","ティアラ μ's","http://steamcommunity.com/id/azusa_twin/","244 products in account","Clannad Official English Release, Published on steam by Sekai Project Developed by Key, who has also developed visual novels like Kanon, Air and Little Busters and many more. Through the course of the visual novel Clannad with over 8 heroines for you to choose from to build a relationship with However, there are also 3 other characters, one of which doesn’t appear in the anime those three aren’t really relationship choices but it is more about finding out more about whats going on in the world of Clannad. In total, there are over 11 routes in Clannad. Being themed around family, friendships, bonds, and relationships.\n\nThe StoryClannad starts off in a dream like world where everything appears to be covered in snow. This world is called the Illusionary World. There is no life in this world, except for one young girl and a robot made out of junk.\nThe story quickly shifts to the real world and get to see the world of Clannad through the eyes of Tomoya Okazaki an emotionally distant delinquent student, a student at Hikarizara Private High School. After losing his mother in an incident and subsequently falling victim to an abusive, alcoholic father. Unable to play basketball after that fight, Tomoya becomes a student that just hate the thought of school, showing up late to class and not trying in the classes he does show up to become a “normal” thing for him. He spends most of his time at Youhei Sunohara’s dormitory. Tomoya Okazaki who have a friend, provably his only friend, Sunohara, a blond and is very energetic who is also a delinquent, that is Tomoya’s best friend. Together, the two scrape by school, coming to class only during lunch break, and then sleeping through all of his other classes, and on some days just outright skips school all together.\nOne day, being late for school, Tomoya comes across a girl who wears the same uniform as him. She is standing at the bottom of the hill leading to the school trying to motivate herself to go to school. Together, Tomoya and the girl, who we find later is named Nagisa Furukawa who is repeating the year due to a severe illness, enlists Okazaki to help revive the school’s drama club. With nothing much else going on in his life, Okazaki agrees to help, making friends with many other students in the school along the way, and overcoming all of the different problems and challenges that they face. From there, the story branches out into many routes.\n\nRoutes/Comedy/ProgressionAll of the routes in the main part of the game are balanced very well with humor matched with strong drama, the routes/characters are well written. Kyou is brash, loud, and quick to anger often flinging a dictionary as a weapon. She mirrors Tomoya in many ways as she does show a softer side with how she treats her twin sister, Ryou, and her pet, Botan. Fuko is hilarious with her love of star fish and her suspicion that Tomoya is, “a strange person”. Kotomi, a genius, is very innocent and harbors an obsessive fear of bullies. Those are just a few of the colorful and interesting personalities you will come across while reading Clannad. And finally Nagisa\nNagisa, loves Dango, but has very little self-confidence. Her interactions with Tomoya vary from sweet and cute, to serious, In that sense, she feels very real. She may act childish, but she is in fact very mature,insecure, and lacking confidence in herself.\n\nThe comedy in Clannad is hilarious, the drama is what makes it an unforgettable experience. Many characters have experienced death or suffered emotional trauma in the past, or might be struggling to carve out a new identity. Kotomi’s route, and Fuko’s route stand out in the first part of Clannad as two of the strongest stories. Both deal with heavily with the family theme, and coping mechanisms to tragic events. (I can’t say much here because spoilers..)\n\nWe also learn more about the Illusionary World and the two inhabitants of it. by playing through Clannad. The story of the Illusionary World is advanced slowly, and in the After Story, it finally plays a very important part of the story as a whole.\nWithout After Story, Clannad is a cute, bittersweet visual novel with some very good moments and a great story. With After Story, Clannad becomes something different. It becomes a valuable experience that you will never forget.\n\nThe character development is probably ONE of the best I’ve ever seen in a story, the pacing is not too fast or too slow, and the emotions that this story extracts out of you are just unbelievable. As you play through the Visual Novel, you will get attached to the characters very easily because of the character development that Clannad brings to the table. Most of the characters are dealing with issues and many times you will be able to relate to them.\nOverall it is a very memorable experience, with all the build up that the Visual Novels offers and then after some time you will start to feel many emotions that the characters in the Visual Novels and… Tears will start flowing down your face. Unless your heart is ice.\n\nSound and Music elements and Visual elementsWhat makes Clannad great is, the soundtrack. The soundtrack list is very huge, having over 45 different music, 4 of them are vocal pieces. All of the soundtracks are memorable and are perfect in setting the mood of the game having the ability to alter your mood just through music and making you shed a tear. Ranging from from silly to energetic music, to slow, atmospheric songs, that will make you feel time around you has slowed down to a standstill and you’re just indulging in the beautiful music. For those who have watched the Anime, when you start the Visual Novel with the in game menu you will be hit with nostalgia in an instant because that is what happened to me, it’s like everything replayed in my head in that instant just by listening to the soundtrack.\nAmong all my favorite is, Roaring Tides, I really love it so much it is a really a beautiful soundtrack very outstanding.\n\nVisual ElementsThere are new features to clannad 1 of them being a HD Upgrade: All visuals have been upgraded to 1280×960\nDangopedia that is exclusive to the english version, the Dangopedia is a Encyclopedia that is a handy refrence tool for understanding aspects of Japanese tradition and pop culture.\nAchievements, Clannad has achievements that are steam supported! There’s also an in-game menu to review your achievement progress.\n\nTo Sum UpI would highly recommend anyone to read this Visual Novel because giving this a miss means you are really missing out. In fact you are missing a very valuable experience, it will change how you view your world completely. Clannad has a story with a message, a message of showing the importance of family, friends and more.\n\nAtogakiThe Art, The Story, The Music, The Characters in this Visual novel is just amazing. The characters surpass any Visual Novels in terms of growth, complexity, and how I am able to connect to them. Clannad is a masterpiece(kamige) in both story telling and character development. A thing i did not mention is that Clannad also changed how I viewed people around me in fact it changed me quite a lot it, because it teaches me to be appreciative to people and appreciate the things you have because no matter how bad you think your situation is there is always someone is out there alone and lonely suffering in a situation far worse than you. It also showed me that people, no matter the ambitions or situation, can live a happy life. It showed a simple yet happy life, it showed that everyone has issues they need to learn from and overcome. Clannad showed me the strength of family, and the weaknesses of it at the same time. It’s a story that everyone can relate to.\n\nClick here for the full review steam has a word limit sadly[azusantiara.wordpress.com]","November 23, 2015","true","47.9"," 227 of 279 people (81%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","81","227","279","15","7"

Though $50 is a lot of money for game, much less a visual novel, it is definitely worth it. Clannad is one of the greatest visual novels of all time. If it helps you, go see the anime if will help make up your mind wether this is worth the buy (anime only covers one route).\n\nPlot - 5/5 The plot can be slow as sometimes one single day in the visual novel can take half an hour or more to finish. But it is worth it, as it has an amazing plot. Especially After Story. Anyways, the visual novel has many routes, and if you've watched the anime, basically every girl has a route of her own. There are also some other routes other than the waifu routes. There is also unlocking After Story, which takes a lot of time. So this visual novel isn't a quick 3-10 hours - it will probably take over 100 if you want to finish all routes and clear the game. You will also get many choices throughout, not leaving you to just watch without actually doing anything. Many choices are important, and can sometimes lock you into certain routes.\n\nArt - 4/5 Some may not like Clannad's unique artstyle. At first I was unsure but quickly got used to the interesting artsyle. Sekai Project also did a great job of improving the quality of the overall game. Backgrounds are great, as they actually include people in them and there is some variety to some backgrounds. (e.g classroom has a few backgrounds depending on the time of day)\n\nSound - 5/5 The soundtrack for Clannad is amazing. Each song can easily fit the mood and current scenario. It is also a pleasure to listen to. It was also a nice bonus for Sekai Project to get the original voice actors from the anime (excluding Tomoya).\n\nCharacters - 4/5 Each character gets their own moment to shine. Almost all characters have a route, and each character has a unique personality. Most are very likeable as well.\n\nOverall - 5/5\nGet this game if you are a fan of Clannad, or if you want a nice visual novel to play. Highly recommend. If you are not able to get it at the price it is at, it is definitley worth getting the game on sale.","December 8, 2015","true","7.9"," 99 of 109 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","99","109","5","1"

And if you're put off by the price, let me explain to you why it's totally justified.\n\nOh, and by the way, if you haven't seen the anime, you can play this game and still understand everything, so don't worry.  If you've seen the anime, you'll only fall even further in love with the characters and the struggles each one goes through.  I saw the anime first and found it very touching, but even having seen it, this visual novel totally blew that experience away and gave me a million new reasons to love Clannad.\n\nWhat I love about this visual novel is that you can play it both casually and seriously; if you're just interested in dating a bunch of different girls and unlocking the funniest achievements, you can do that.  It has some seriously hilarious moments and hidden bonuses that are great on a casual level without you needing to get bogged down with the emotional baggage of the story if you really don't want to.  However, if you want to throw yourself in at the deep end and experience everything, you are going to be there for a LONG time.\n\nThere is SO much content in this visual novel to keep you replaying and replaying to get every CG, every hidden scene, every possible outcome, every piece of music...  it's almost endless.  Unlocking every achievement and completing the full game's true ending requires a HUGE amount of work; you'll need to play through every route until you unlock what is basically a second visual novel on top of what you just played - and then play that a few times, making little changes at the right moments to unlock that incredible ending you've been searching for.  It may sound off-putting to have to do so much, but believe me, it's worth it.  I won't expand fully for spoiler reasons, but the second you lose your heart to this story... you will not rest until you've brought happiness to that girl.  You will tell yourself that getting an okay ending is satisfactory enough and that you've played it enough times now to leave it alone...  but you'll keep coming back.\n\nI cannot fully tell you how personally invested in the story I became, and how every time I loaded up the game, I convinced myself that I had to keep going until I found the solution to gain that ending.  I actually felt responsible.  I must have clicked over a million times and I lost count of how many times I cried, but by the time I was finally finished, I felt so happily exhausted and strangely vindicated as a human being.  'It's just a game', they always say, 'it has no bearing on real life'.  But I don't think I need to convince most of you guys that games are one of the greatest mediums for life lessons and inspiring moments that make you change your view on life, and Clannad does that.  Clannad made me realise how much I want to help people.  It made me realise that you should never give up on anything, no matter how hard it gets.  When you play this visual novel, you will feel such a yearning in yourself to make the bitterness in yourself and the people you love go away...  and you'll have the power to do it.  I know all of this will probably sound like wanky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to some of you, but I just can't articulate how deeply Clannad moved me as a person.\n\nIn closing, Clannad is brilliant on many levels, and if you think you can handle the feels, you should dive headfirst into it right now.  You will cry, and you will feel spiritually exhausted...  but in the end, you'll have experienced a world in which you can be the miracle somebody needs...  and have a miracle granted for yourself in return.\n\nSoaring music.  Perfect visuals.  Spot-on translation.  Natural pacing.  Unbelievable replayability.  Engaging story.  A visual novel that goes beyond romance and dating, and touches the very core of you...  what are you waiting for?\n\n10/10, would cry again.","February 3","true","48.6"," 72 of 74 people (97%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","97","72","74","5","3"

It shows purpose, fulfillment and satisfaction can be attained and at the same time it teaches people that the most unexpected things can sometimes come from the most unexpected person. It will show just how far an ordinary man will go just to help his friends and family.\n\nWhat truly sets Clannad apart from other visual novels is its clear representation of emotions. I would highly recommend this VN to anyone, it is well worth the money and has a very enjoyable story, it has excellently designed characters which are so incredibly believable; specifically with their personalities, as you keep reading the VN you will notice changes with each character, and you will come to love each and every one of them.\n\nClannad has many different arcs that are just as good as the last, the choices you make throughout Clannad can alter your entire experience, it has a beautiful story and many touching moments, those who are looking for drama, romance and slice of life genre look no further for Clannad is exactly what you are looking for. Overall to be honest this VN is a must own, I believe that most people will be able to relate greatly with Clannad.\n\nI hope that this review has helped you in your decision in getting this VN and I hope you will enjoy the whole experience as much as I have, it is not only my favorite thing on steam but the anime adaptation is my favorite anime of all time, if you are so inclined I'd recommend you go check that out too; happy reading :3\n\np.s anyone else want Clannad trading cards? I am all for that\n\n(Like all my reviews I do not put a score as it is my belief that games like all forms of art are subjective and therefore it is impossible to afix a number to them)","December 16, 2015","true","232.7"," 79 of 87 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","79","87","7","2"

But was it worth your money? After spending a lot of time reading it, my answer is: Yes, it is. Or maybe No. It depend.\n\nHaving played the game long time ago, both in its native alchemical moonrunes language (because PSVita is dying on western market) and in fan-translated by based Doki, I still find myself coming back reading this novel again and again and enjoyed it everytime. Especially Tomoyo's route.\n\nTalking about the Sekai's translation, I gotta say that I'm a bit disappointed at some point and wish they just stick with the Doki's original translation. I'm not saying they're bad, maybe it was just me being nostalgia with the old Doki's translation but Sekai need to stop doing re-translation of an already fan-translated visual novel. Overall though their (re)translation is good, not great. Most people will be okay with the translation though, but I know some people will complain.\n\nAbout the content of the game itself? You'll be in for a deep, long and full of suffering treat that you'd better say that the amount of tissue in your room is from masturbation and not from (manly) tears. The arts is undoubtly outdated and overstayed its welcome but then again this is a RETRANSLATION not a remaster. I wish that Sekai Project get their hand on Siglus and port the whole CLANNAD there but I guess VisualArts hasn't released the SDK for public yet and Sekai Project is being treated like an outsourcing developer (thus why, if you haven't heard yet, VisualArts is going to release Harmonia, Tomoyo After and Little Busters! under their own flag, not Sekai Project's). The art might gets on the nerve for some people, I myself to be honest cannot stand Nagisa and Ryou because their design is just too weird for me (ROACHHHH) but bear with it for the journey you have will be worth it in the end.\n\nSoundtrack is top-notch as expected of Jun Maeda and Shinji Orito, from the low of melancholic to the high of happy, it has everything on store for you that ready to kicks in at the right time. I have the soundtrack on my iTunes and from the playcount apparently I have played most of the soundtrack of CLANNAD and Tomoyo After around the average of 600 times. My favorite gotta be Roaring Tides and Light Colors, and the vocaloid version of Over.\n\nFor the story it doesn't have to be explained in this review as CLANNAD is pretty mainstream, but for those who never got around to read the VN nor watch the anime, the story for each heroines varies and I'm sure each one of them has their own entertaining moments just right for any type of people. Ofc Nagisa dies at the end of CLANNAD is obligatory for everytime CLANNAD is mentioned.\n\nFor those who already watched the anime or confused of where to start for CLANNAD, READ THE VISUAL NOVEL FIRST. I cannot emphasize this enough to everyone whenever they asked about this question.  Always  read source material. Granted, this is a translated source material, but one who cannot read alchemical moonrunes cannot complain, can they?\n\nSo to answer the question that many have asked, Does this game worth its full price of $50?\nNO\nOnly grab this visual novel if it's on sale below $40 or  ONLY  buy it if you are a fan of CLANNAD/Key♥♥♥♥. Or, you know, you have lots of money to waste. If I can be honest myself, for digital download of CLANNAD it should be around $35~$40. That's the reason why I was the early bird backer for CLANNAD so I can get it for only $30.\n\nNow give me Tomoyo After and Rewrite on Steam already VisualArts/Key, I have waited for this day to come for a long, long time ago.\n\nI'm a Tomoyofag btw.

However, if you do not wish to die, you can instead be allowed to live and make a happy life for yourself. But instead of execution, your punishment will be to have your happy life collapse around you, with you being forced to watch those you love and care for most die before your eyes without being able to do anything to help them.\n\nSo dislikers, what will you choose as your punishment?\n\nAnyway, CLANNAD is one of those classic VN's that, until now, has never been officially translated. It did recieve a critically acclaimed anime adaptation, and if you have seen that you can basically look at this game as being the "unabridged version". This game is quite old now (2004), so some might find the art a little odd, but the story itself is superb and at the core of why this game, and the anime that spawned from it, are considered among the best ever made.\n\nAs for the price tag... it is pretty damn steep. Too steep some would say for a VN, and I'll respect the decisions of those who decide that the current 50$ cost is just too much for what is essentially a story game with some voices and anime drawings. But there is one thing I do have to say about the cost: This is one of the largest game stories ever created. I don't know for sure, but around 80+ hours is the generally accepted figure given for how long it takes to beat this game. That means, at a price of $50, you will be recieving ~96 minutes of game for every dollar you spend. It might be a visual novel, but that is still a hell of alot more bang for your buck than most Triple-A game releases these days.\n\nFor those who do choose to buy and play this for the first time having had no exposure to either this game or the anime before this... enjoy the ride. It's a long one, but very very much worth it. Hopefully your heart won't be crushed too hard by the time you make it to the end. :3","November 23, 2015","true","70.3"," 205 of 295 people (69%) found this review helpful 129 people found this review funny","69","205","295","129","24"

It took me 1.5 hours just to get through the timeline covered in the first episode of the show, and I'm a fast reader. The show only covers about 20% of what is told here, and that's if you choose to follow Nagisa's storyline instead of an alterantive storyline with another character. To give you an idea on how much content was cut out, the events covered in the first episode of the show happened across three days in the VN instead of one day in the anime. There are many other untold tales and small intermediate events that are not included in the show, thus it's definitely worth looking into.","November 23, 2015","true","6.3"," 89 of 123 people (72%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","72","89","123","20","4"

While the translation from Sekai Project is far from perfect, it is more polished than the fan translation that is available on Internet. And Sekai Project really made an effort to make this the best CLANNAD release ever, including extras not available in the original PC release like voices, HD asserts, Dangopedia and Archivements.\n\nIs it worth the $50? Yeah, it is a step price for a visual novel. However, visual novel are more like books than games, and the line count number for CLANNAD script is bigger than the whole Harry Potter series, or almost thrice as big as The Lord of The Ring trilogy[gaming.wikia.com]. So I think it is a good price, considering the effort to translate everything. Just FYI, this is my second playthrough of this VN (the first one was using the fan translation). I finished all routes and did all archivements, using a walkthrough so I wouldn't waste too much time going nowhere in the story, and my reading speed is pretty average. So around 100 hours is a good average of time that you will spend reading through everything.\n\nAnd like lots of reviews already said, yeah, you're going to cry. However, not only about the sad things, but from small piece of happiness that occurs in the progress of the story. This is a VN for everyone, it does not matter if you're a man or women, child or adult. This is my second time playing it (the first one was the fan translation 3 years ago) and I still cried for different reasons.\n\nIf you never heard of CLANNAD before, just play it. Don't bother watching the anime or reading the manga adaptations first. It is not that they're not good, the anime at least is very good (I never read the manga), however it does miss some of the small details that makes this work awesome. I do recommend you to watch the anime from Kyoto Animation (forget about the movie, it is bad, really bad) after playing the VN though, since there is some scenes that simple are better animated.","December 11, 2015","true","81.8"," 40 of 47 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","40","47","2","0"

Clannad will make you laugh\n2, Clannad will make you cry\n\nThe second point is why this visual novel is so legendary. Clannad won't just make you cry, it'll make you bawl your eyes out and sob uncontrollably. It's the hardest I've cried in 10 years. But it may take a long time to get to that point because for the most part Clannad is a lighthearted and genuinely funny VN. It's a game that you have to allow time to tell its story and enjoy it along the way.\n\nClannad is structured into two parts: the main story, and After Story, which is unlocked after completing the character routes in the main story. The main story is similar to a dating sim, but just saying it's a dating sim is like saying baseball is a game where you hit a ball. It goes far beyond just romance and touches on themes like loss, family, nostalgia, change and the cycle of life. Each female character has her own unique route that is the length of a visual novel by itself. This allows for exploration of each character's personality and struggles and touches on a theme unique to that character. In that way, Clannad's main story is much like a box of chocolates, each one to be savored in their own way. Some routes are very lighthearted throughout and only have a bit of sadness at the end, while others will completely rip your soul out. It's a very cathartic experience overall.\n\nMy only real gripe with the game other than having a few parts that felt dull is that some of the routes are a bit too well hidden and tough to get on your own. This makes getting to After Story, and especially its true ending, difficult and frustrating unless you consult a guide. It's a real shame because After Story is not just something that was tacked on, it's the completion of the game and the telling of its most powerful message. You'd be doing yourself a great disservice by not seeing this story to the very end. So don't feel bad if you have to use a guide, I know I had to.\n\nOne more note: this VN has an excellent soundtrack, each theme perfectly conveying the emotions they're going for. By the time you finish, Nagisa's theme (Dango Daikazoku) will move you to tears when you hear it because of the overall connection you have with this character and Clannad in general.\n\nTL;DR - Clannad will make you feel alive. There's a very good reason why this VN is so highly-ranked and has a dedicated cult following despite being over a decade old. When people say Clannad can be a life-changing experience, they're not kidding. It's that powerful.","February 27","true","77.0"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","19","19","0","3"

I've completed the game using the pirated version because I did not want to spend $60 AUD on something I might not like. But after finishing, I immediately bought it from steam at full price without any hesistation. This goes to show how much I love this game.\n\nPlot-wise, this is a romance game and is split into 2 sections: a school arc and an after story (AS) arc. I'm not gonna say anymore because that's for you to explore if you decide to give this game a try :). But be warned, the feels train has no break once it starts and you'll be crying your eyeballs out throughout the entire journey.\n\nGraphics-wise, the art style might not suit everyone. I was taken aback at first but got used to it eventually. If you're like me, please stay with it. Don't let this stop you from playing.\n\nGameplay-wise, all you have to do is read and choose options. That's it. Be ready to read A LOT though. I remember reading someone's comment saying that the amount of words in this game is more than the entire Lord Of The Rings trilogy!\n\nSound-wise, this game has some of the most memorable, beautiful soundtracks I've ever heard. I've begun taking piano lessons just to play some of these tracks.\n\nLength-wise, this game is very long. I think it took me more than 150 hours to complete all the major paths and reach the true ending yet there are still some hidden paths and hidden dialogues waiting for me.\n\nOverall, I don't consider this a game. I consider it an experience. A life lesson about friends and family. This game literally changes my outlook on life. I've been gaming for more than 10 years yet never have I ever cried while playing but man this game managed to do that.\n\nMy only gripe with the game is that it's so hard to unlock AS and reach the true ending. It's practically impossible to complete this game without a guide (for me anyway). There are many guides floating around the internet which you can freely look at. I used these 2 (http://soukyuu.emevas.net/CLANNAD_guide.html) and (https://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/921463-clannad/faqs/61132). They aren't mine btw. All credit (and my thanks) goes to respective authors.\n\nAnd that's it! I hope my review helps you decide. I sincerely hope that you'll give this game a try since I think it's something everyone should experience at least once in their life.\n\nP.S. As you may know there is an anime adaption. The anime is really good however imo it's nowhere near as emotional as the VN. Therefore if this is your first time experiencing Clannad, I'd strongly recommend the VN. If you don't have the luxury of time then the anime would have to do.","May 26","true","0.1"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","23","26","0","0"

If you don't like anime or dramas, this game probably isn't for you. I had the original game (Non HD) for some time, but only finished one or two senerios. After buying the HD version on steam and investing quite some time into it, I can garuntee that you will love this game.\n\nPros:\n-Absolutely stunning soundtrack\n-Well written and flesh out characters. There isn't a single main or side character that has an inconsistency or hole in their story\n-Long and touching routes (you will be brought to tears)\n-At least one of these senerios is relatable to your everyday life.\n\nCons:\n-The art style. People seem to hate the art style. I think it grows on you as you play, but I didn't care for it originally.\n-Length. At times there is a lot of filler text that isn't important to story, and makes routes take so much time.

First off I can't really give a definitive review since my English is bad and grammar is hard, so uh take it with a grain of salt.\n\nAlright so we got the world reowned Visual Novel studio Key, the highly rated story of CLANNAD now available on Steam-o-roni.\n\ntldr; this game makes you wana cry and die\n\n(Sort of a "full(?) review down there")\n\nWhile I only have completed my first route which happened to be Nagisa route, it was a rollercoaster of emotions like everyone tends to say. I'm not over-exaggerating but it is really felt something right out of the box being that my only previous experience with Visual Novels is Katawa Shoujo(Which is hands down a great Visual Novel too[Shameless Plug]), let me just tell you for now that this isn't a generic short VN you find quite a lot in the Steam Store, while I won't say their bad they sort of lack in the story department.\n\n\nRighty, story then? How does it go? Well with Visual Novels the choices you make will determine which of the main heroines in the game that you'll be chasing or be chased at. Starting out with my choice I went with Nagisa the moment I layed eyes on her since the moment we were introduced at. Something about her stood out for me, and this goes without saying that she's friggin' adorable. It's hard for me to judge it's story since I started watching the Anime first then went into the game. In with the comparison there's some diferences here and there comparing the route and Anime took in the game's route.\n\nStory: 9.5/10\n\nGoing with the flow we have the art style while isn't "modern" to keep up with the hip kids it has its charm to it since it's quite fairly old dating back all the way to 2004's. So like this is kinda 00's era. As I've stated above while I've only completed 1 route so far which is Nagisa's path. Her CG's are great and well detailed in every-way possible with vibrant colors. It can definitely do better in this deparment but hey it's from the 2000's.\n\nArt: 8.5/10\n\nFor the music, I'm really astounded by how marvelous it is. The music really put me into the atmosphere in which scene it was depicting be it a a mundane class-lesson to a spur of the moment confession. I really don't have much else to say about this it's just great, fantastic, superb, not even words I can desribe the sound. With the most memorable sound track of mine to be "Nagisa".\n\nMusic: 10/10\n\nGameplay department? Well it's what you'd expect out of any Visual Novel realistically, you click, you read rinse and repeat. This ain't no triple A game where you run to Point A to Point B and blast enemies high off the earth and off to the moon with cool rockets looking guns. Standard click and read kind of thing. Did I forget to mention? The well layed out UI and settings makes it goes hand with hand.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\n\nOverall I can say for sure is this is a must have for die hard Visual Novel dudes or dudette's out there. This kind of story telling, music and art style mixed so well that, well you can't help but roll up in a ball and cry the living daylight out of you. Just buy the damn game already dammit!\n\nOverall: 9.5/10","May 3","true","52.5"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

I would HIGHLY recommend following the Clannad walkthrough guide on the Kazamatsuri web site. Without it, you may be hard pressed in figuring out what it is you're supposed to do. This game is basically like reading a book with added audio and soundtrack. Also, you must complete the game numerous times (while altering your choices) in order to experience all the routes. The first route for me (baseball route) was nothing special imo but it works as a good introduction for all the characters in the game. The proceeding routes from there are impactful personal stories of each of the characters. It is also important to note that while the game is not exactly a fantasy genre, it does employ fantasy elements such as the orbs of light that you collect as well as the Illusionary World (all of which become relevant in After Story). After Story is considered to be the "main" story and is unlocked after collecting 8 light orbs obtained throughout different routes. (The skip diolouge function makes this much faster to get through).\n\nI personally loved the story telling of the game and the emotional ride was unforgettable. If you don't mind reading, I would highly recommend this game.","December 6, 2015","true","105.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Clannad tells a deep story that unlike 90% of visual novels on Steam, doesn't value fanservice more than story and character development.\n\nIn terms of presentation it's great. The artstyle may be hit and miss to some people, however there is a charm to the aesthetic, even if it's a bit odd at first glance. The HD remaster definately improves the quality of the images, when compared to the resolution of the standard edition of Clannad. The music is really good and helps to set the mood of the scenes being shown and the voice acting is very good, even if the protagonist isn't voiced like he was in the anime.\n\nClannad is an incredibly long visual novel, in fact it's one of the longest visual novels available. Each route in the first half of Clannad takes around 5-12 hours to complete, depending on the route and reading speed.\n\nThe second half of Clannad, which unlocks after completing all the routes of the first half, is easily the greatest part of the visual novel, even if mostly because most of the impactful moments happen during that half. In total Clannad probably takes around 100+ to complete fully.\n\nI will say that it probably wont be everyone's cup of tea. There isn't much violence or sexual innuendo in Clannad, as it's focused primarily on telling a captivating romance story. It's a very family oriented story, as that is the main theme of the visual novel.\n\nif you are interested in Clannad, there is also an anime adaptation that faithfully follows most of the routes (although omitting some of them completely, even omitting an entire character.)\nOverall if you enjoy visual novels, I can highly recommend Clannad. It's incredibly long, but none of the story routes are particularly bad, so it shouldn't be a chore to read.","November 23, 2015","true","15.7"," 25 of 38 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","25","38","4","0"

Or Enya.\n\nCLANNAD is a popular Japanese visual novel that was originally released in 2004, developed by a company called Key. Having been translated to English by fans in the past, this is the first official English release, courtesy of a Kickstarter started by Sekai Project in 2014. This iteration includes HD visuals (which I believe are from the PS3 version), Dangopedia (to explain Japanese terms, culture etc.) and Steam achievement support.\n\nI am not going to say very much about the story at all because it is extremely spoiler heavy, so beware of looking up almost anything to do with the series if it is new to you. It is difficult to specify an exact genre, but drama, romance, slice of life and supernatural all fit rather appropriately.\n\nThe Steam tag of “Story Rich” could not be more apt. The word count of CLANNAD surpasses a number of books (combined) in classic literature. That does not automatically make it great, but this volume of text feeds and gives flavour to the many rich and different story arcs and endings that are available within the game. This means there is well in excess of over 100 hours if you want to read and see absolutely everything. CLANNAD is not a kinetic visual novel so this means gameplay requires you to make many decisions throughout the game which will impact the story.\n\nThe story is an emotional rollercoaster like no other and never falls short in the ‘feels’ department. As a result, I would struggle to see how the game and story could not have an impact on your future outlook in life. Yes, it’s that good.\n\nCharacter development is of the very highest calibre and you can simply not help but admire and love all of the different characters; feeling and sympathising for them as they suffer through various trials and tribulations. There are of course, some stereotypical characters traits, but character individuality is strong and always shines through.\n\nThe graphical style is excellent with plenty of variation in computer graphics (CG) throughout the game. Environments are colourful and vibrant which fit well to the various settings and key points in the game and some are nothing sort of stunning. Having said that, I do personally still prefer the art style from the animation by Kyoto Animation in comparison to the art in this game; even though it is the original source material.\n\nCLANNAD is lavished by a soundtrack which, in my opinion, is the best feature of the game and one of the greatest soundtracks of all time. Jun Maeda crafted some of the most beautiful music ever written to fit both the ups and downs of the game. There are so many wonderful tracks, with outstanding piano pieces such as 同じ高みへ (To The Same Heights) and 小さなてのひら (The Palm of a Tiny Hand). There are many other great tracks composed by other staff at Key, such as 空に光る (Shining in the Sky) and 潮鳴り (Roaring Tides), but again – a big warning about spoilers when seeking these out, because the Internet and YouTube in particular, is flooded with them.\n\nI spotted a review online once which quoted: “CLANNAD is the greatest story ever across all genres and media”. I couldn’t agree more with this and the fact that the Kickstarter smashed its stretch goals is no coincidence.\n\nVisual novels are (finally) breaking through and gaining popularity in the west so I can understand some people might stumble across this and be highly apprehensive given the price point and type of minimalistic gameplay that a visual novel usually involves. Therefore, if you are not convinced enough to buy the game then, please; at least do yourself a favour and go and watch the animation (the one by Kyoto Animation). After 40+ episodes your transformation will be complete and you will then come back to buy and enjoy the game.","November 23, 2015","true","7.0"," 28 of 46 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","28","46","4","0"

Aside from a subtle element of the paranormal, this is an excellent VN to start off with if you're new to the whole shabang, and definitely if you're not into the more crazy stuff Japan puts out there.\n\n£30 is a bit steep in my opinion, because it can take up to 10 hours before you realise it's a sound investment. Highly recommend at £15, still recommend at more.\n\nAlso, unless you are literally a rock, bring plenty of tissues; the feels shall be felt.\n\nGAMEPLAY RECOMMENDATION\nFor an optimum gameplay experience, follow a spoiler-free guide. There are different opinions on which order to play the game through, so I'll state my opinion but it's just a guideline; you can do more-or-less any order you like. Here's my recommended order, as well as a rating out of 10 (in comparison to other story arcs):\nRyou - 6/10\nMisae - 9/10\nTomoyo - 8/10\nYukine - 7/10\nKyou - 8/10\nKappei - 9/10\nSunohara/Mei - 7/10\nKotomi - 10/10\nFuuko - 9/10\nKoumura - 5/10\nNagisa - 8/10 (play this last always; it helps story flow)Again, I'd like to stress that these ratings are in comparison to eachother; overall the game is a 9/10 in story and execution, with a perfect length: short enough to capture the attention of airheads such as myself, but long enough to warrant its price-tag.","April 28","true","19.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

This was one of the best purchases I've made on Steam and, just like how its anime counterparts are on the very top of my lists for most favorite anime series of all time, it'll take a hefty and severe kick to knock these down my lists. I instantly fell in love with Clannad back when the first season first aired. It's the only anime that I've actually gone back and watched multiple times while still having the same impact on me every time. Since I never got my hands on the original VN and heard this was coming to Steam, I knew right then and there that it wasn't just some random purchase. It was a purchase that I NEEDED to make. I've truly fallen in love with this series and that love still stands firm to this day. Clannad is one of those masterpiece anime that is VERY rare to find these days.

If you haven't watched the anime for it, then this game will be an even better experience because you won't really be able to predict much. There are 100 profiles/accounts which is kind of jokes and I can give you my word that every penny is worth it for purchasing this game. I would give it a 9 out of 10 or 10 out of 10, I can't decide because I wish there were a few other things I wish I could've personally said or done in the game but you're gonna love this game 100%. Video games are good for you, especially Clannad because you're living in your own imagination and living the outcomes of your own words and actions. It's not very disappointing at all. Cheers.\n\nSPOILER ALERT (just me blabbing on some thoughts): I still kind of wish I had more choices, though especially with Youhei. I felt that Youhei was really cool, I didn't appreciate the idea of how my character naturally always plays jokes on him and teases him. I kind of wanted to treat him more sincerely and warmly (I just like a more genuine close friendship). It was always nice to interact with Nagisa but the vibe always feels really gushy. Miyazawa was a super cool person. Kyou was only okay to hang around with, Ryou was really nice to hang around with. Tomoyo seems to masculine, it kind of disturbs me because I want my character to have the aggression and fighting skills that she has. I don't like how my character is such a delinquent and slacker in school, let alone there aren't that many specific talents or skills other than his interactive skills. Most of the girls seem really shy and the ones who aren't act overly bold or overly tough but they were always nice which I like. Kotomi was pretty cool but she was really socially off. Fuko seemed pretty cool as well but there weren't that many options of communicating with her. Nagisa's parents were jokes and nice people. I didn't talk much with Mei, yet. The street light or guitar guy and the dorm lady was okay, I guess. Anyone else I didn't mention was mainly meh and okay or I didn't talk to them, yet. I know I probably should feel that I have a lot of choices but really, I've already watched the anime so that's probably why I feel that way.","March 1","true","7.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

For several years now he has been a delinquent with no goal after school ends, but after a chance meeting his life begins to change. How it changes is up to you as you make the choices of his life in this massive Visual Novel.\n\nClannad is absolutely massive. Don't go into this VN expecting to be done in a few hours. Well, perhaps you can finish a single path in a few hours (depending on your reading speed), but if you really want to dig into the game, it's going to take you much longer than that.\n\nI personally found Clannad extremely slow to start off, but once it got to the later parts of each story path, it really picked up. Once it does start to pick up, your emotions are going to get hammered as the story takes a lot of turns. That said, the slow ramping up parts made it really hard to read for me.\n\nI do recommend Clannad in general, however the story does start off a bit slow. The asking price is also extremely high for most (though considering how much content you are getting, I do feel the price is justified), so if you're on the fence about getting this then you may want to just try and wait for a good sale.\n\nDisclaimer: I was provided a key for review by the publisher.","December 28, 2015","true","60.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

He has no mother, his father is an alcoholic, and every day is miserable for him. His only friend is an annoying idiot, and he's constantly late to school. Despite all this, he still lends a helping hand to those who need it, and never expects anything in return. That all begins to change when he meets a girl named Nagisa, which kickstarts a bunch of changes in his life that (depending on the player's choices) proceed to lead him to blooming relationships with old friends, new faces, and help the people around him achieve happiness.\n\nThe other main part of the story is the "Illusionary World" which is sometimes an intermission between certain dates in the story. The Illusionary World segments focus on two characters, a single girl and a doll made out of junk, and it takes a long time (read: a lot of reading) to figure out who they are. Not every route goes through the whole thing, and some stop earlier than others.\n\nWhat really drew me into this story was its world and characters. Everyone in this game feels like a real person, with very strong characterization and development. As Tomoya (and by extension the player) grows to know these people, I wanted to help them with their problems, I wanted to see them get their happy endings and overcome their hardships. The only exception to this rule is Tomoya's best friend, Sunohara. I generally found him grating, and had the serious urge to skip through most of his dialogue (which I couldn't resist doing at quite a few instances). But even Sunohara, annoying as he is, still has a lot of depth and tons of great moments.\n\nAnd it's not just the story and characters that drew me into this game's world, the music and voices were a huge help to the experience. This game's soundtrack is simply phenomenal, from the calming title screen music, to the somber pieces during the emotional scenes, and the upbeat sounds of the silly scenes. The music perfectly fits whatever is happening, and I wish I had the money to buy the soundtrack, it really is that fantastic. The voices are all perfectly delivered. Everyone sounds the way they look (if that makes any sense), and they make the emotional scenes all the more powerful. The voices are only in Japanese though, but that isn't too much of a detriment, and I'm a dub person.\n\nThe visuals are okay, I wouldn't say they're anything spectacular, and it might take some time to get used to everyone's eyes being so freaking far apart. Some of the CGs also look a bit weird, especially the first one you see, but it isn't too detrimental. It can also be annoying to some that the game isn't in widescreen, but it seems every visual novel has that "problem."\n\nAnother nice feature is the Dangopedia, which is basically a helpful tool for people who don't know all the culture differences and references, which is really helpful. However...\n\nAs much as I recommend this story to people, I don't think this is a beginner's VN, especially for its price. $50 (or equivalents) is a really steep price for a game that is essentially nothing but reading with the occasional choice (Some routes have more than others) to see how the story plays out. I'd recommend trying out a freeware or at least very cheap VN (like Katawa Shoujo) to see if this kind of game is for you before considering buying this.\n\nGranted, this is well mitigated because assuming you don't skip anything, this game is about 80-100 hours of reading, and it's a really good read.\n\nI spent 48 on this game during the holiday sale last year, and I have no regrets about it. It may not be for everyone, but if you want a truly emotional and touching tale, then you can't do much better than CLANNAD","April 3","true","78.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","2"

Triumphs, tragedies, insecurities, self doubt, the meaning behind living and dealing with death. You will laugh out loud, and if you really read this story and take things seriously, it's very likely to cause you to shed tears of sadness and joy several times before the end.\n\nIs it flawless? No, I think there are stretches that go on for a bit too long and some of the character specific routes resonate much better than others. The art is a little weak, but that can be forgiven due to the age of the title. Any complaint pales in comparison to the emotion the story can bring out in a person. It's really caused me to spend time reflecting on my life.\n\nAnyone who likes visual novels owes it to themselves to play this story, regardless of the cost of the game.","May 23","true","32.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It really is a nice, long game, and the repetition as you try the different paths isn't too bad, since almost every different choice unlocks truly different scenes and dialogue.\n\nHighly recommended, especially if you're somebody who gets into a game and feels totally let down when it's over too quickly.  Some routes will be more fun than others, depending on your own style and interests (as usual for many-route, romance-option games).  The main route is touching and and I was really surprised that the second part of the main route is so long and detailed.  (Unlike many people, I didn't know about Part 2.)\n\nExcellent CGs.\n\nGo Tomoyo!  Gotta love the uber-ninja girl.  And the story with the twins, especially Kyou (the scary twin) is really well done in my opinion - you just have to make some hard choices either way.\n\nThe big question is always "is it worth the price?"  Well, I think the full price is probably worth it - think of the price of a movie ticket and add up the hours of entertainment - but if you can get it on sale (like right now 50% off!) then it's a great buy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SlatedShale/recommended/324160/","SlatedShale","SaltyShale","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SlatedShale/","52 products in account","Simply put. BUY IT NOW! I don't have as many hours in this game as Fallout 4, but I feel like I'm playing this game longer than it. I'm a really huge fan of Fallout 4 (yes, even though it's not as good as Fallout 3 or New Vegas, I can look past the flaws and enjoy it.) Enough about fallout 4 though.\n\nThis is the only visual novel I, personally, will play and won't stop for hours. I've tried to play the F2P ones on Steam. But their stories are kind of meh. Now, let's get going with the reivew;\n\nClannad is a visual novel originally made by KEY studios in Japan. Sekai Project translated it this year into english. In this novel, you play (I guess it counts as playing, i don't really know how you would catagorize it) as Tomoya Okazaki, a deliquent in his third year of high school. He skips class, falls asleep, and doesn't really care about a whole lot of things. But one day, he meets a girl named Nagisa Furukawa. From there, you can choose how the story will move on. I won't say anything else, because spoilers.\n\nThe characters in this game are very likable.  In my current play-through, I haven't met two characters, and I didn't complete one of the arcs, but that's just how I played what was given to me. Some of their personalities are very believable and EXTREMELY likable maybe even lovable. You will get very attached to all of the characters, no matter how little, or long you may speak to them.\n\nIt plays just like an other VN, so not much to say there.\n\nThere are two settings in this story; the real world, which takes place in japan (the setting for a lot of slice of life anime, vn, manga, etc. apparently) and the secon done, The Illusionary World. The real world is where most of the story takes place and where things are the best. Personally, every time I saw that the story took me to "The illusionary World" I didn't enjoy playing it as much. Now it is a neat sub-plot, but not as much fun. You don't get any choices, so you're basically just reading a book, but with nice pictures, a nice soundtrack, and on a computer.\n\nArtstyle is nice. It's different. But nice. I like the design of the characters. Their eyes are the size of watermelons, but that's what makes them neat, and in some cases a little bit cute (not trying to be a weeb or anything).\n\nThe soundtrack is beautiful, even though there are only like 4-5 songs that you can clearly hear at every part of it. But the songs you do hear. HOLY ♥♥♥♥! Soooo goood. During the emotional scenes, the song refelcts that.\n\nAll-in-all, I HIGHLY recommend this to any anime fan. ESPECIALLY those who have seen Clannad and Clannad ~After Story~. I give Clannad, a 9/10. The only downside to this game is the music, and the illusionary world segments. I just didn't enjoy those segments, now that's my opinion others will feel different. And the other downside is the music, you hear like the same 3 songs 95% of the times. 2 other songs 4% of the times. And the remaining 1% are songs you hear like once or twice, or during certain sections, certain converstions, and certain arcs, and if you don't play your cards right, you won't hear them.\n\nAlso, I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY *HIGHLY* watching the anime. It's very good. My number 1 anime.","January 7","true","21.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You either like them or you don't. CLANNAD is massive with tons of choices which matter... but it's also very expensive.\n\nI'll rather say things about the technical aspects of the "game":\n- There's a checkbox in settings, "Make this program run more slowly in order to make other programs run faster", by default it is off. The only difference I can see is that when off, the game will hog 100% of one processor at all times. When turned on... the game takes virtually no processing power. LIKE IT SHOULD AS AN IMAGE AND TEXT DISPLAYER. So, make sure to check that.\n- The game seems to have massive issues with Steam Overlay at the moment. There are many resolutions and scales (the game has scaling for 50%, 75%, 100%, 150%, 200%) where the Overlay simply won't show up. If you come across this and want to use the Overlay (useful for screenshots etc.) try changing resolution and/or scaling and it might pop up... while lagging terribly. Still seems to work, at least for me.\n- Otherwise, the game is rather barebones as far as settings go. It has the basics (like turning off voices per character, text window background color changing, etc.), but it lacks some stuff like being able to turn off the custom mouse cursor. Which is, to be honest, slightly infuriating, as the "click point" of the cursor is on the lower left, rather than upper left like it is just about everywhere else.\n- The save system is pretty cool as it allows you to write memos on each save file, which is really useful considering how the game has - probably without exaggeration - hundreds of choices which actually matter (not just "pick this option or you get a bad end" options, but options which determine what girls you'll meet. Some girls will even interact if you've met them both, whileas some will prevent you from going to see another girl (like the class rep stopping you from skipping class, where you'd meet another girl)). However, it completely lacks an auto-save function, which would be somewhat useful... even though it'd need to record 10-20 saves to be useful. Oh, and the system also allows you to move or delete saves with ease, which always nice to see.\n- The load system, unfortunately, doesn't show you any message backlog after loading a save. If you're coming back to a save after a while, you might be completely lost at what point of the game you're at because of this.\n- Dangopedia is pretty cool, though if you're a complete weeaboo you probably don't need it to explain what a kotatsu or bento are. Really useful for people new to the genre. Though, chances are such people would pick a cheaper title to start with...\n\nPS. Kyou best girl, but has the worst route. I had already played this years ago in the fantranslation, and ragequit after completing that route. Did the same here. Not sure was I even expecting anything else, really!","January 1","true","22.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Be warned do not try to do a whole route in a single shot. You may find yourself aboard the feels train before the end, I took time outs where  I saved the game quit and did anything but this in order to get over it. This game is truly worth it and the translators have done a wonderful job at this. Heck it if you want to know there is around there are 7+ routes you can do all with different endings as well as major changes to the story. Some parts will be the same but once you truly get down a route, you will see how different it is from most of the other ones.\n\nIf I had to rate it, I'd give it\n10/10 for length (It is long as hell if you're going to do all of it)\n9.5/10 for character (Most characters in it are really well done and you can almost feel the emotion in what they say)\n8/10 for music, I did like it alot, but not all of it may be for you or for me.\n10/10 for enjoyment because I felt like I was there and I was taking part in this and at times I forgot that I  was not actually the main character (You can rename him to your own name)\n9/10 for the story (I can't give it 10 because, oh those feels and if you get a wrong path, oh god why, you got to through it all again.)\n\nOver all it is about a 9.8/10 for me and I say buy it, if you can while it has a discount but I paid full price and you know what, I don't regret it.

This game has made me laugh at times, and given me the feels at others. Looking forward to playing more. If you like visual novels, definitely get this game.\n\nEDIT: I have finished CLANNAD now, took ~34 hours to complete. Did a couple playthroughs to get different paths, used a guide for some of the difficult achievements. This game was truly amazing, got a lot of immersive gameplay (well, reading) for a visual novel, and I use the app every once in a while to replay a scene, listen to the soundtrack (which is amazing by the way) or browse the gallery of pictures.\n\nTL;DR\nCLANNAD is a great visual novel that has a lot of strong points; visuals, music, and storyline to name a few. However, it won't appeal to everyone--the game can get tedious at times and the animation style isn't for everyone.\n\nPros:\n-Tons of storyline\n-Likeable characters with different, rich backgrounds\n-Great soundtrack\n-Hours upon hours of gameplay\n-Numerous endings (1 for nearly every single character)\n-The feels (both funny and sad moments)\n\nCons:\n-A couple lulls in the storyline, you might get bored if you have a short attention span or aren't interested in a certain arc of the story\n-To get all the achievements you must do numerous playthroughs that can be tedious without a guide\n\nOther Notes:\n\nVisuals: I personally liked the animation style, but others seem to think they are derpy and stupid-looking. Personal preference I guess.\nNo Steam Cards: Unfortunately there are none, and some only play games for them.","November 29, 2015","true","35.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingofkoopas/recommended/324160/","kingofkoopas","King of Koopas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingofkoopas/","174 products in account","Now that I've completed the game (minus some extras) I'm going to share my thoughts. This review isn't going to be about the quality of the story itself, (other reviews have done it better then I can) but rather about the translation coming from the original fan translation for the full voice version.\n\nSekai I feel did a mostly good job with the translation. Those who played the original fan patch knew that the translation really fell apart as you got deeper in, with afterstory being extremely hard to understand at times. While it was a rocky start at launch, after a few patches I can happily say the translation is of great quality. While I did notice some errors here and there (the game being as huge as it is, to be expected) they weren't constant enough to really notice. For example, I only noticed one in afterstory, and given the context it might have been intentional. My only gripe is that you could tell they took a few liberties with the translation. For example “Furakawa Bakery” is translated as “Furakawa Bread”, a change from both the fan patch and the subs for the anime. (unless my memory is failing me) I also noticed “Hamburger” was changed to “Salisbury steak” as well as other small things. I can only really recall once instance where these minor changes really bothered me though and unless you're like me and have both read and watched this story too many times, you'll will prob not notice.\n\nTo me, however what really sells the 50 dollar price tag in the updated assets. While I agree that some of the CGs come off as deformed, the HD assets were still nothing short of an upgrade for me. So while some deformed CGs came of as more so, the ones that looked good already looked REALLY good. Some of them looked so good in HD to me that I felt like I was looking at them for the first time. Some of the music tracks have also been remixed and in my opinion, sound better then the original. It's small, but these updates really made the experience feel fresh to me.\n\nWhile I feel Sekai should have waited longer to proofread everything at launch, I'd say 99% of the errors have been fixed since and as it stands, this is the definitive version of CLANNAD for those looking for play the VN. I've watched the anime 4 times, read the visual novel twice, and backed over $150 to the kickstarter so if it wasn't a good product, I would have been ♥♥♥♥♥♥ right off. I'm glad to say that I”m not dissapointed and I'm really glad to have taken the 4 or so months it took me to re-read this monster. If you're looking to read the VN I can safely say, despite the price tag, pick up this version over the fan translation. That or wait till a sale and pick it up then, as any fan of visual novels owes it to themselves to at least try this timeless classic.","April 17","true","98.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It doesn't need me to confirm its greatness. This visual novel boasts a huge amount of content and at over 100 hours in I know I still have plenty more to go. 80 hours is for the speedrunner who skips way too much and honestly, who speedruns a visual novel? Even after having watched the anime it still successfully pulls the heartstrings because there is content here that is not in the anime. All in all, a great piece of work that will always be so highly regarded. One thing that did irritate me though, is the size of the eyes. Having played several other visual novels and then jumping into this straight away soon after it was released on steam the size of the eyes did seem abnormally large, most notably on Ryou but, you get used to it very quickly. Simply put, you may not be able to justify £30 for a visual novel most of the time, but this is a great piece of work with over 100 hours of content as long as you don't speedrun. So if it goes on sale at all and you're into visual novels, don't hesitate so much.","April 23","true","106.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You know its going to be great, but life happens and it becomes hard to get all the way to the end. Still, Clannad does an amazing job of evoking a variety of emotions from laughter to heartbreak.

I played the fan translation of this game and even supported the kickstarter a year ago. If you don't know what this is, heres what you need to know.\n\nClannad is a romantic VN, you go around making choices which impact who you will end up dating.\n\nThere are 2 Arcs To unlock them you need to complete every scenario and you will end up with, well you will find out ;)\n\nIt takes around 500 hours to play the game, the game is absolutely huge, although 4gb is not much space, you can complete the game quicker if you use tricks that fast froward the game really fast.\n\nThere is an Anime based on the original VN, there are 2 seasons, Clannad and Clannad After story, watch Clannad first, they are both very good.\n\nThis game will make you cry, This game is very powerful and I don't know a soul yet who hasn't cried while playing it. Expect to have major feels :3\n\nThis game is worth the 50 dollars, I know 50 dollars seems like a steep price but take it from me, It is well worth it, I have been a fan of Clannad for 5+ years, and this game is worth 100 dollars in my opinion.\n\nThe soundtrack is awesome, The songs on the Clannad soundtrack are absolutely incredible, trust me this is amazing.\n\nIf you aren't convinced, go watch a youtube playthrough, I know at least one guy played the original VN to completion with no commentary, can't remember his name, lets play clannad is what you should look up, but don't watch the entire thing you should play it yourself ;). I also highly recommend the Anime I actualy stumbled upon clannad by accident 5+ years ago and actually watched the after story first not knowing there were 2. Watch Clannad then After story for the complete effect.\n\nThank you Sekai Project for bringing this to Steam you guys rock!

Developed by KEY back in 2004 who are well known for works such as Air, Kanon & Little Busters and the well known anime Angel Beats comes a beautiful story of family and friendship that I think we can all learn a little from. This visual novel is packed with 80+ hours of content, an interesting & funny set of characters, a story that will make you think about your own life and a soundtrack that brings a tear to my eye every time I hear it.\n\nIf you have ever seen the anime or enjoyed any of KEYS previous works I urge you to read the visual novel, not only does it add a lot more to the story than the anime but with this release you get HD assets and the Dangopedia to help understand those cultural terms that might not make sense to the western audiance making this the most complete release of the game to date.\n\nIf you are a fan of the drama/slice of life & romance genre I recommend you give CLANNAD a go, you will smile, you will laugh, you will love & you will cry.\n\nP.S bring some tissues, you will need them.... not for that you dirty bugger no H scenes here!!!","November 23, 2015","true","8.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

Clannad is an absolutely beautiful Visual Novel that teaches you about taking care of your friends and family and how you should always keep them close. With the brand new dangopedia implemented into the game, we can get to learn a bit more about the culture of Japan without the use of searching it on the web. Yes some of the visuals may be a bit dated, but im glad that they the original CG the way it was but made them a bit sharper and more clear. Overall, you are definately getting your moneys worth on this even at the $50 price point, especially when it takes over 300 hours to completely do everything in it.","November 24, 2015","true","16.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

I don't know why I love it.  It is totally the opposite of the things I like.(As my game library may suggest.)   I have a Japanese version of this game that I can't even play.  I been waiting for the English releash ever since I finished the anime.  When this project came up on Kickstarter, I was pretty excited.  After a long wait, I purchased the game at the price of $42.  My first thought: I like it.  I played this game for a few hours, no bugs found yet.  Translations make sense and have little wiki on the side.  Never played many VN before, so I can't say how good this is compared to others, but from what I've seen so far, I highly recommend this game.","November 24, 2015","true","43.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I can only imagine how much longer others have been waiting compared to me.\n\nPlaying the VN takes some time to get used to if you are used to watching it in crisp 1080P on blu-ray before this and the anime had much better drawn characters but the VN gets it's point across to you quite well, only having been in the game for a little under 2 hours now and I have already seen a fair bit of content I have not seen/read in the anime! The VN has all the tracks you know and love from the anime as well. I look forward to seeing the paths of the character relationships as the game progresses and look into getting Okazaki with the other girls and seeing how that plays out, however I think we all know which pairing is the best xD ( dango? )\n\nAs a Clannad Fan, I would give this a 9/10 ( More of a personal preference, kind of a tough one since I know this VN is actually from 2004 but me personally just going from the blu-ray anime to this kind of annoyed me but 9 is still great, the resemblence to the anime is very good with the exception of some minor details at times but the asking price of $50 is high in my opinion for an old game which isn't quite on the same level of visual quality as Tales Of Grisaia for example )\n\nFor people who have yet to watch or know pretty much anything about this series I still highly recommend you get this VN, but if you want better value purchase copies of Clannad and Clannad afterstory on blu-ray then buy this later on when hopefully the price drops some so you can get yourself into more Clannad content as I am currently experiencing! :3","November 24, 2015","true","9.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Philtering/recommended/324160/","Philtering","Philtering","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Philtering/","181 products in account","Clannad was and still is one of the best visual novels even after 10+ years since its original release. Clannad blends a fun slice of life school setting with emotional drama and romance. Combined with a stellar soundtrack and pretty CG this makes the formula for a great game and a lot of tears. Those looking to only complete a couple of arcs might see that the high price isn't justified and should wait for a sale as I don't see 8 hours of gameplay is worth. Those who are commited to reading everything the game has to offer will be rewarded with one of best stories ever written with about 100 hours of content.\n\nClannad is about Tomoya Okazaki, (or whoever you name the MC) a teenage boy who is struggling to find meaning in his life with his high school days slowy disappearing. One day on his way to school, he meets a strange girl, Nagisa. He sees her attempting to motivate herself to go to school and keep moving through life as well as talking to herself, asking herself how to move forward when everything changes. Tomoya befriends her and the visual novel revolves around Tomoya and his adventures with him and his friends in this slice of life novel. I really don't want to spoil anything and recommend you play if without any spoilers. If you didn't watch the anime I highly recommend playing this first and then watch the anime after.\n\nClannad has one of the best original soundtracks ever, beautiful art and CG, and one of the bests characters and stories for a game. If you're looking for a waifu game you'll like this game, but the game gets more deep than that after multiple arcs and playthroughs. Each main arc generally revolves around a girl and each arc has it's own story and not a variation of the same story. You can pour about 100+ hours into this game just to experience every arc and every arc is different with different characters focused on and the main plot and driving action being different. This is almost like 10 novels in one, so there replay value after you finish an arc is huge. I recommend this for anyone looking for a visual novel or want to start reading visual novels\n\n-The characters are extremely lively and unique. From your best friend, to the the boys dorm manager. Most of the characters you will end up liking by the time their arc is over. Some of the character arcs are lively fun and full of laughter and some will ultimately make you sob. The overall story is beautiful and I think everyone should experience every arc including the After Story arc which is unlocked after finishing every arc. Even after finishing the main After Story, you'll need to play it a couple more times. And every time you do you'll need more tissues.\n\n-Gameplay is you basic visual novel gameplay. There are very few interactables and even those are simple. You get to make A LOT of choices though. These choices aren't your typical go hang out with waifu B to end up with her in the end. The choices you make impact the game a lot and some arcs require specific actions to complete and you might get a "bad ending" as a result which might turn people off. I recommend a guide if you get stuck because it'll be fustrating to get "bad endings." But try to play the game without spoilers. If you watched the anime then go ahead and use a guide. The anime grazed through the arcs pretty fast so there's still a lot unexplored content for you to go through even though you know the main plot. At it's best, you're laughing at all the shananigans and hi-jinks you and you're friends get into. You'll also be crying because the writing allows you to connect with almost all of the characters and you'll generally feel for them. At it's worst which is rare, you'll be reading long passages where nothing significant is happening or you're reading over a passage you already read. (Skip previously read text feature, helps a bit with this) Overall, reading this novel is enjoyable and I found myself changing who's my favorite girl each time I finish an arc.\n\n-The music sets the tone for the game very well. Each track sets the mood of the situation almost perfectly and it intensifies the experience. Clannad is has one of the best OST in video games and is up there with TWEWY and Persona 4\n\nClannad changed my life. I got into visual novels when I was about in middle school and this novel helped me find meaning in life. I recommend this novel to anyone who was like me, who went to a new school and didn't know anyone and anyone who struggles to find a reason to keep going or don't know what they're going to do with their life. I generally recommend this game to everyone. I gaurentee it will affect your life in some small way.\n\nOverall I give this game a 10/10. The beautiful music and CG along with a well written story make this one of the best visual novels ever.","November 23, 2015","true","34.2"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","0"

I cant believe its taken so long to get to this point and have had lots of different choices to make, does this mean I can go way off the main story line of the anime if I so wish? I dont know not looked into it to be honest. All I will state right now is, the development team have done a great job on the HD remastering and the music giving me that nostalgic feel and has made feel the rush when I first watched this show. I did think the price was steep, but after seeing the size of this game I can honestly say it justifies the cost entirely . Finally I love the dangopedia, a databank thats keeps hold of all the words or phases you come along your journey and explaining them in detail once you come across them.\n\nAs of right now I can recommend this to anyone who loved the show or likes a heartfelt romance, If youre unsure about it, go and watch the anime as I really believe this story should be viewed by all  (PS buy some tissues).","November 23, 2015","true","17.9"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

It's a comedy and drama mix, full of a hilarious and endearing cast of characters that you'll love to laugh and cry with.  It remains a poignant and enduring work today as a testament to the importance of "family," the impermanence of life, and the consequence of choice.  Great, upbeat songs that can get easily stuck in your head, accompanied by glorious somber pieces that encapsulate the feelings on screen. The art style is a bit of a turn-away for me personally, but it still has great backgrounds and is at least consistent in what it depicts.\n\nOn a more technical level, this game is a fairly traditional branching-path bishoujo game.  On a surface level you would expect this to be a very fanservice-heavy, "compliment girls to advance relationship" kind of setup, but for CLANNAD the dating sim elements are very toned down, there are no sex scenes, or really even any fanservice.  Certain routes even follow some of the male characters, who in my opinion are by-and-large much more interesting than some of the more archetypical/tropey female cast members.  Thankfully the more important characters seem to have the most screentime and longest routes.  "Gameplay" exists solely to continue the story in various directions, based on a few small options that lead the main character in a certain direction (for instance one involves simply going to talk to someone you see outside a window).  Most of the actual character interaction is done without player input, so don't expect much heavy moralizing on choices. Specific to this English version of the game is the "Dangopedia," which explains some of the more culturally-specific aspects of Japan, namely things like food, holidays, school life, etc. that us Westerners might not immediately understand.  And finally to those worried about the steep price, please note that CLANNAD is the eighth largest video game script in the world, and clocks in at 1.4 million words, almost a time and a half that of the ENTIRE Harry Potter franchise.\n\nIf you like to laugh, cry, and overall become emotionally attached to a great cast of characters, CLANNAD is a great entry into the visual novel genre, and works well in distancing itself from the more questionable aspects that could keep people away from them.  Though if I could recommend anything to you, it would be the anime. :)","November 23, 2015","true","80.5"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

I really did.\n\nOther visual novels I had completed before this are YU-NO and the Muv-Luv trilogy (not to mention countless real novels), and I fully expected this to be superior to those two due to dealing with something as serious as family and coming-of-age themes in a realistic setting. I waited over half a year for the Steam release and instantly bought this when it arrived. Well, having reached the True End after 50 hours of reading, I have to say I was disappointed. It was extremely difficult for me to enjoy the story because it's riddled with so many dramaturgical blunders, the major ones being:\n\nCartoony characters and forced drama.\n\nMost of the cast is made of generic moe/harem characters, and not very good ones at that. There's a Shy Clumsy Girl, a Tsundere, a Kind Woman, a Manchild, a Dumb Comic Relief Friend, and so on. Many of them don't behave even remotely like real, complex people do (with a few wonderful exceptions like Yoshino and Tomoyo). The worst offender is Nagisa Furukawa, who is the first girl the main character meets and the main love interest, and the likability of whom the After Story section relies on. To put it bluntly, she is an imbecile. She acts like a five-year-old, never achieves anything by herself, constantly needs support from the protagonist Tomoya, doesn't have interesting chemistry with him, and is just plain useless. The last straw for me was this: At the moment when she - who is supposed to become the president of the drama club she wishes to recreate - revealed that she had never even SEEN a play before, I instantly lost EVERY SINGLE BIT of remaining sympathy I had towards her. Hence In After Story, when she dies of childbirth, all I could think of was "Good riddance."\n\nThe pacing is also far too slow relative to the amount of actual story content. Most of the time is spent on these so-called "slice of life" sections, which are supposed to develop the characters, but are mostly filler in actuality. The result is that the plot takes ages to get going. After Story is not much better for the first few hours: Tomoya starts life as an adult, getting a job and his own apartment and so on. Aside from an admittedly good mentor-apprentice relationship, this part is not told in a particularly engaging way, it just... happens. Slowly.\n\nMost of the routes in School Story (first half of the VN) follow roughly the same formula: Tomoya meets a new character, many hours are spent getting to know their gimmicky personality, then Sad Stuff happens, and finally Tomoya fixes everything. Maybe we learn their parents are dead, or maybe something unfortunate is about to happen to them. Real drama grows naturally from elements of the plot such as the protagonist trying to attain an objective, interactions between characters with differing goals and worldviews, mistakes they make due to weaknesses in their personality, and difficult decisions and consequenses. The "drama" in Clannad on the other hand usually comes from the authors forcing misfortunes onto the characters (Muv-Luv Alternative is also highly guilty of this) and appeals to the lowest common denominator, the prime example being Kotomi's backstory. I believe the problems of the drama come from the mindset the stories are made in. You see, Key, the maker of Clannad, is a company that specialises in producing these things called nakige, "crying game" - that is, games that are supposed to make you cry. There's nothing surprising about the "sad" stuff once you can fully expect it due to the genre, and it's even more ineffective when I couldn't care about most of the characters. It's just poor melodrama and feels shallow and exploitative.\n\nOne of the most famous, supposedly tear-jerking scenes happens near the end of After Story and deals with Tomoya's relationship with his father. Well, after 45+ hours of waiting for that payoff, I found that it resolved it in an incredibly contrived and anticlimactic fashion. Tomoya basically has a sudden epiphany after a talk with his grandmother (whom we've never seen nor heard of before, making her a deus ex machina) and decides to become a better person, just like that. (And there's some crying thrown in to make it more "moving". Jeez.)\n\nThe themes and lessons taught in Clannad are safe and inoffensive, aimed at making the reader a better person. "You should be considerate of your family and the people around you." "Hard, honest work pays off." "You should accept that things don't always go the way you want and must look on the bright side." "You should search for a better solution in situations that at first don't seem to have one." And so on. I gained very little from these as they were either something I myself already had figured out a long time ago or even some cases fundamentally disagree with. In real life I've dealt with far more complex and nuanced social situations than I encountered in Clannad.\n\nWith all this this complaining, you could get the impression that I think Clannad is bad. Not quite. While I find it incredibly overrated, it does have plenty of redeemable qualities. There are well-written characters and routes (Tomoyo Sakagami's, Mei Sunohara's and maybe Kappei Hiiraki's), and there are demonstrations of good responsible behaviour and life wisdom here and there. Tomoya has beliavable, interesting relationships with Tomoyo, Yoshino and Ushio. Youhei Sunohara is a good source of slapstick and comic relief.\n\nIn the end, I felt I had most of my time wasted and wish I had watched the much shorter anime adaptation instead, and I recommend you do just that. Or maybe you will enjoy this more than I did, who knows.\n\nEDIT: I found these insightful articles on the Internet that discuss much more in-depth than I the weaknesses and strengths of Clannad (based on the anime version). Beware as they contain spoilers.\n\nhttp://wrongeverytime.com/2013/04/27/clannad-a-critical-overview-on-character-development-dramatic-structure-and-thematic-dissonance/\nhttps://subtlechaos.wordpress.com/2012/12/03/why-clannad-is-overrated-in-the-form-of-a-review/\nhttps://subtlechaos.wordpress.com/2014/10/01/why-clannad-after-story-is-also-overrated-in-the-form-of-a-review/","December 31, 2015","false","51.8"," 124 of 347 people (36%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","36","124","347","19","24"

It's an all time favorite of mine. I own original DVD's including After Story, I bought official soundtrack available in Japan ( which was WAY too expensive to get... but I really liked the songs so it was worth it ). Also I played it OFFLINE hence very little time is displayed on Steam.\n\nI was hesitant whether to buy Clannad on steam, most reviews were not helpful or honest and written by fanboys/girls. I didn't want to pay 29.99 GBP for the story that I already knew, music that I heard countless times... and yet I bought it. I bought it to support Key, I would like them to release more of their Visual Novels here on steam.\n\nThat being said I do feel dissapointed. Don't get me wrong the art style is ok albeit a bit dated but in HD. Story is the same as anime and it seems like everything is there BUT here's where the experience sucked for me.\n\n* Small spoilers ahead *\n\nThere are some new routes and jokes that weren't present in the anime which is great BUT those that are similar to anime lack visual impact and motion. Let me explain : Tomoyo kicked some bullies on motorbike which looked awesome in anime. They added cheesy spectator view and made her look badass.\nIn this Visual Novel the only thing you get is Okazaki looking out of the window only to comment on what is happening. Yeah that's it.\nNext example : Remember when Sunohara wanted to join the drama club? Okazaki had thought : If this was and RPG... Then in anime we had cool RPG hud displayed and all three options chosen. While in VN there is only text... yeah. It doesn't deliver the impact that anime has.\nThere is more examples like this so VN feels a bit poorer in that aspect.\n\nOK,OK someone might say : OH BUT(T), VN has more content! MOAH CONTENT! More jokes and it expands a bit more of the story!\n\nNow calm down you ♥♥♥. Yelling doesn't make your argument helpfull. Yes it does have a little bit more than anime but I found out that in some routes like FUKO it doesn't really expands ANYTHING. It's the same thing that anime had! SAME FLIPPING THING. Same ending except you get LO! Two different CG... and slightly different dialogue.\nI've seen it in anime. It does not add anything to my experience.\n\nYou know, I'm not caomplaining. I could look pass those points that I have stated. After all it's and old Visual Novel with a new paint on it. It's a classic so I guess I'm being picky BUT there is one thing I will not back down. CHOICES.\n\nYep you heard me. Choices the game gives you.\nWhen I started playing Clannad I wanted to go with Tomoyo route. Oblivious to the fact that her route * SPOILERS * is blocked... Yep you heard me. I ended up with a bad ending. You need to do FUKO and MISAE routes first to get to Tomoyo route. WHY? I felt so angry that I have to do two routes I didn't really wanted to do... In the end you have to pretty much stick to anime's path to get in the general direction. When I started the game I didn't know I had to do Fuko and Misae first. The game DOESN'T TELL YOU. You must magically figure it out by failing...\n\nSo I went with Nagisa for a while ( in anime eventually Tomoyo shows up ) and I thought there will be a branching to Tomoyo route BUT NO. It won't show up. Instead I somehow got myself on Fuko route WTF? That wouldn't be half as bad however I didn't do everything PERFECTLY ( all the choices have to be JUST RIGHT ) and I messed up her ending... Didn't get to wedding day. Only to CG scene.\n\nTo sum it all up. WHY OH WHY, game dev's thought it would be a great idea to set up mines on players route only to watch them fail over n over again. There is around 50 + choices to make in Fuko's route. If you miss important ones YOU ARE DONE. You won't get the happy ending. Sometimes its easy to guess but other times you find yourself puzzling what the heck did I do wrong?! I wish the game valued my time a bit more. Game devs 1, player 0. GG.\nI like choices but at least after failing couples of times give me hint. Highlight important choices or something. Because it will get confusing and furstrating to waste time.., trust me. Anime in that regard is just a pleasantry.\n\nIt's not a standard Visual Novel. You need to invest time and after many fails I recommend using a Walkthrough... hopefully spoiler free one.\n\nSo can I recommend the game? Yes to those who haven't seen the anime but for those who have anime WAIT for the price drop. Save yourself frustration.\n\nI heard that Tomoyo's After is being worked on which is great. I hope KEY will release it on steam. Go Key go!","March 18","false","2.4"," 15 of 120 people (13%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","13","15","120","2","9"

Well, I love the story. As of writing this review, I've only been playing the VN for about an hour and half, but I've rewatched the show 3 times. It's so good. I cried (more like sobbed) the first time I watched it, then I watched it at my birthday party and all of my friends and I cried, then I rewatched it on my own and cried some more. Okay. By definition this is a harem. By definition. Arkada worded it best in his Kanon review, "95% percent of all harem shows are there for a quick laugh, but are usually just a waste of time. VisualArtsKey take up the other 5%", and that's really true. This story is BEAUTIFUL. The music is BEAUTIFUL. The art is BEAUTIFUL.  The ending is... Up for debate, but in my opinion it's BEAUTIFUL. But you know what's not beautiful? The fact that when I was finishing the show I was supposed to be sleeping, but I was crying so hard snot and tears were everywhere, and since I couldn't get up, I had to use my own dirty laundry to wipe the tears and snot from my face. I bought the show, I bought this, and I bought Side Stories, mainly for 2 reasons. 1, I love the story, and 2, I wanted to give Key all of my money for making this masterpiece. So yeah, whatever way you prefer, through the show or through the Visual Novel, experience this story, cry for hours, support the devs, and contemplate the ending. That is all.\n\nWait, dango, dango, dango, dango, dango, daikozoku~","June 4","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
