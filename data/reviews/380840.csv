For everyone who complains about, that the enemies are too good:\n\nDisable the filters and play "DDRace" or anything that sounds similar. It's a game mode, where the only goal is to reach the end and its coop => no enemies and it teaches you very important movement. Maybe use the spectator mode to see how other people are doing it and try to do the same.\n\nAnother advice: increase your mouse sensivity. It's important in this game to move your mouse everywhere on the screen very fast.\n\nCheaters aren't actually that common. It's quite easy to see if someone uses an aimbot and you can votekick them. With most weapons the bot doesn't help you much anyway. But of course if you play very well people just assume you cheat, because you learned to move very fast.\n\nAlso don't try to play this game with a ping>100.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\n2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.","January 18","true","0.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","4","6","4","0"

Excuse my game hours; I have hundreds more non-Steam.\n\nTeeworlds is a 2D, free, online multiplayer, deathmatch-style game in which you control your own personal, cute, Kirby-like Tee that shoots regular guns, lazars, grenade launchers, and shotguns. Of course, all of the typical gamemodes are there: deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag... But what I found to be the most interesting is the modded gamemodes (because Teeworlds is opensource). I was  spending a more on Infected (one person starts out as a zombie and slowly infects everyone else), DDRace (a gamemode in which you attempt to clear an obstacle course), and some of the other gamemodes than the original ones.\n\nAnyway, play this game? Please? You're REALLY missing out if you don't.","August 24, 2015","true","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Loads of fun!\n\nSo why a thumbs down? LAG. lag completely ruins the fun fast paced action of this game. for some reason, most servers for this game, and this game only for me,  lag regularly above 180ms. you'll also notice that the top scorer has the lowest lag. which is causing people to realize what really causes you to win. HINT: its not you. I'm not pouting over a loss, in fact on the lower lag servers, i sometimes top the board, and thats the problem. Lag is still clearly what gives you the win, and so evening winning isn't as fun.

Simple CTF with nearly no harddrive space taken up...but honestly thats it.

It started its self larger than my screen, so I couldn't see anything around the edges, or, subsequently, find a way to put it in a window or decrease the resolution, even when looking at the entirety of the game. Secondly, and only while the game was up on my screen, the mouse would drift whenever I stopped moving it, making it near impossible to enter a game (although it didnt end up affecting the gameplay very much) Also there are no instructions, with such a simple game its pretty easy to figure it out with simple trial and error, but there could very well ahve been large parts I was missing.","September 1, 2015","false","0.1"," 4 of 24 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","4","24","0","0"

There are no IAP'S. there are no crates. There are no purchasable hats. There is no pay to win. It's blissfully simplistic.\n\nIt's a 2D team shooter with one of my favorite mechanics ever: Grappling Hooks. Grapples are one of those mechanics thats easy to use, yet really hard to master. the average player will start out with uing it to boost jumps, and within a few weeks of playing adapt to it and can go across, even under the map better and faster than rocket jumping in Tf2. Despite being old , it still has a small but dedicated playerbase, meaning whenever i wanted to play, i could. all this, plus plenty of FREE customization items, for only 6MB on your drive!\nPROS:\n5 different weapons\nGRAPPLING HOOKS!\nFree as Free can be\nDedicated playerbase\neasy to pick up, hard to master.\ntakes up no space\nCONS:\nSmall playerbase\nLack of Team balance (yes it will make you wish you had TF2's teambalance. 7v3 happened while writing this review)","February 25","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically, you're this little Kirby that fights other Kirbys in currently 3 gamemodes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Capture the Flag. All of these gamemodes are pretty simple, so you should get the hang of it in no time. In DM and TDM (Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch), you start off with only two weapons; the hammer and a pistol. The pistol has infinite ammo, but it does pretty low damage. Use this if you run out of ammo with the different weapons. The hammer's pretty good at chipping health off, but nobody has the decency for a 1v1 fair hammer battle, so only use it if they're focusing on someone else or you got them trapped. There's other weapons that you have to find place around the map. There's a shotgun, a grenade launcher, a sniper rifle, I think, and there's the almighty, god slaying, ♥♥♥♥ destroying, noob wrecking that came from Satan's ♥♥♥ that he uses daily to sharpen his horns and his nipples for the ladies. It's a sword. But not just any sword. It's a powerful one. It takes off like a billion hit points, so you're lucky if you survive at least one of them. When it's being used, the user can charge at foes at blinding speed, so your only hope is for some other poor sucker to grab the attention of the wielder. It's a pretty rare find, so if you find it, then by all means, TAKE IT. There's also a hook, which you can grab on to lots of things like ceilings or walls, and even people. When used on a person, it takes them to you. Or it takes you to them. I forgot which. It's pretty much your best movement option, since you're flying around like Spiderman. There's also your health bar and an armor bar. Both can be collected from pieces around the map. The armor takes a few hits for you, depending on how much pieces of armor you have, so it's especially useful for surviving the Xx_$w0rD0fd00M_Xx. In Capture the Flag, (CTF), you start off with all these weapons, except for the sword, of course. The controls are pretty simple, and just about anybody can run this game at a lot of FPS, even me, with a potato for a computer. It literally installs in seconds, so...\nInstall it!","September 8, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I will honestly say this game is awesome. I do have a few things I don't like though.\nFor one, you can hook your teammates. You're in a tight situation, then someone pulls you to them, while they're stuck in a corner and uses you as a meat shield.\n\nAlso you can collide with your teammates. You've used your grappling hook to go super fast then all of a sudden one person is in your way then you loose all of your momentum.\n\nAlso, I have had times where I've fallen off of a map that I could have easily used a double jump to save myself, BUT I thought I have already used it so I've fallen to the point where I couldn't grapple hook my way out, spammed the jump button, then double jumped. No idea I even had a jump.\n\nI've also had times where there's a big gap, not able to grapple, I run and jump, but for some reason I use my double jump instead of my jump and fall to my doom.\n\nBut this is a good game overall.\n\nRECOMMENDED!","September 5, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That should tell you how simple of a game it is. Its 2D action done decently, IMHO. There's nothing too special about it, overall, though I do enjoy the cutesy graphics. Speaking of graphics, a toaster oven probably has enough processing power to run this game. I don't plan to play much more of it, if any more at all, but it seems to have a nice little community of active players. Can't really go wrong by playing such a simple free game, but it's not the best use of time, honestly.

The game's graphics is simple, allowing most PCs to run the game without having to install advanced graphic cards (e.g. Nvidia/ATI Radeon). Also, the game file is very small, (about 9 MB), allowing users to download the game for only a short period of time. The game engine is based on game engines used to make online 2D platformer games (e.g. Plazma Burst 2/Raze); so, the game shouldn't be hard to play. What this game is needs right now is more players, more weapons,  more maps (maybe?) and of course, what we all love so much, Hats. Lovely, beautiful hats for the characters to wear.

Teeworlds is personally responsible for the for half of the gun crimes in Los Angeles (Los Santos). A coincidence I think not. How many e's are there in Teeworld. 3. How many corners are on a triangle. 3. How many tenticles does have octopus. 3. How many Pugs does it take to satisfy someones stomach. 3. Illuminati Confirmed. Teeworlds is Illuminati. Teeworlds is Chuck Norris's favourite game. Wanna hear a rumour about Chuck Norris. Once Chuck Norris got shot in the leg. The next day the bullet was in Hospital.\n\nMind Blown.

But I got some advice in-game to download the ddnet client and use that instead of the Steam version, and it has changed my whole experience. Now I fly through maps with ease and have a no trouble dodging and firing.\nThe thing about this game is the huge differences in skill levels. The guys you see absolutely destroying everyone have been playing for a while and will probably wreck you every time. But then one day they won't be able to. And it will feel great.\nThe day I jumped up from an average player to that skill was the day I turned my mouse sensitivity riiiight up. There was an instant improvement in my movement and accuracy. Then downloading the ddnet client has possibly put me almost on par with the pros. Still have the issue of lag to deal with always, since nobody in my country really plays this game, but I have great fun anyway.\n\n10/10, wish I could pay for it","September 16, 2015","true","258.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I guess you could call it "Team Fortress 2 for kids" and I know that sounds weird at first, but you'll understand what I mean if you actually play the game. The game has three modes: Capture the Flag, Deathmatch and Level Creator. You can only obtain three guns in the game, you have health, shields and ammo. There isn't any classes like TF2, everyone is the same character except a different color. I've only played fifteen minutes of it and I already love it. It may seem to simple for some hardcore gamers, but give it a chance and you'll have a ton of fun.\n\nUPDATE: First off, i'd like to say this is NOTHING like Team Fortess 2. Infact, it's a 2D sidescrolling shooter and not first person. If you still haven't played it yet, I recommend you do because it is still really good!\n\n8/10","August 28, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
