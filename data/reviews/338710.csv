It is a wonderfully innovative take on the FPS genre. In addition, I quite like the sparse graphics and sound -- while many might consider them lame, I consider them to be sleek and clean, not unlike chess itself.\n\nHowever, it is terribly, WILDY under/over tuned. That is to say: whereas you have to work hard not to win in training mode (making it ideal for learning the controls and aiming), "normal" mode is ridiculously difficult. There are three reasons for the insane difficulty:\n\n1) The other entities rarely attack each other. But if YOU attack an entity, typically expending energy in the process, any nearby entities target you in your weakened state, even if you didn't hit the opportunistic entity with splash damage!\n2) Even if you manage to engage an entity in complete isolation, it recovers from being stunned very quickly.\n3) Other entities do not have any problems instantaneously targeting your energy globe when you are stunned. But even if you manage to try to start draining a stunned entity before 1) or 2), it often takes time for the entity to roll such that their base and grill work are not protecting the energy globe! By then the entity has recovered (or the other entities take note) and 1-shot you.\n\nConsider this: at the time of writing this review, the most players that had managed to beat at least one map in the entire world (according to the leaderboard) was 15. Most of the maps had the same 3-6 entries on the leaderboard.\n\nIn conclusion, I really, really want to like this game. And indeed, there is something therapeutic about just gliding around these wonderful maps picking up energy motes. I will continue to fiddle with it from time to time, simply because I paid for it. But the reality is that gliding around too afraid to do anything -- because of the near-insta-gibbing that inevitably follows -- gets old fast. Clearly it is possible to succeed; the leaderboards prove it. But I cannot recommend this game as-is, and certainly not for its price given the huge selection of entertainments available on Steam for the same or less.","February 18, 2015","false","3.9"," 48 of 55 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","48","55","2","0"

In the begining its very difficult to get a hold on the game such as steering while aiming for the enemy.\n\nBut this chess fps is one of a kind game in the fps section. you are a mere pawn in the game and you have to slowly steer your way up to be the king.\n\nInstead of the traditional fps games in which they give you different characters, Urja produces chess pieces which have different powers.\n\nThe pieces or the levels are in the order of pawn, Knight, Bishop, Rook, Queen and the King. You beat one, you can take its place by pressing spacebar from a distance of the deceased enemy. Urja may seem difficult at first, but s time passes you will feel the need to play it more and more.\n\nThe game also offers different maps to play and practice your shooting skills.

You like: 'Wut?!', and after you find the manual you like: 'It's the stranges gameplay I've seen!'\n\nReally, it's an attempt to make a social AI model (like seen in anti-utopias such as '1984' or prisons and other mean societies) in a from of minimalistic FPS: you ought to make your way up in the ranks sucking on the rival's bodily energy so that no higher authority see and condamn you! Let the fog cover your evil behavior for if you obey the law you will end up just a miserable servant in the level ruled by powerful lords. And no, you can't organize a revolt with your fellow pawns cause you ain't got no communication means except shooting and sucking, so just sneaky individual terror acts work. Then the situation get even harder for as soon as you 'vampirize' your first bishop, you not only keep searching for a pray in secrecy but also constantly look around not to become one yourself!\n\n**********\nКогда впервые заходишь в эту стрелялку, такое ощущение, что попал в страну сумасшедших - мягко скользящие сущности, замаскированные под шахматные фигуры, перемещаются по нереальным пейзажным структурам, и, не обращая внимания ни на тебя, ни друг на друга, собирают капли энергии, остающиеся от случайных метеоритов, и просто двигаются из стороны в сторону... когда пытаешься понажимать на кнопки, обнаруживаешь, что способность к стрельбе истощает эту энергию из твоего тела пешки, а если непосчастливится в кого-нибудь попасть, то сбегутся старшие фигуры и покарают без суда и следствия. Ты такой: "Чо?!", - а как найдешь руководство: "Это самый странный игровой процесс, что я видел!"\n\nПравда, это попытка создать модель общественного искусственного интеллекта (как в антиутопиях вроде "1984", тюрьмах и прочих подлых сообществах) в виде минималистичной стрелялки от первого лица: нужно пробиваться вверх по служебной лестнице, отсасывая телесную энергию из соперников так, чтобы не заметили смотрящие! Да сокроет туман твои злодеяния, ибо, ведя себя миролюбиво, ты кончишь убогим слугою на уровне, где царят могущественные господа. И нет, революцию босых пешек организовать не получится, так как нет средств общения кроме выстрелов и отсоса, поэтому работает лишь скрытный индивидуальный террор. Затем становится еще сложнее, когда "вампиризируешь" своего первого слона - не только продолжаешь потихоньку искать жертву, но и все время оглядываешься, чтобы самому не оказаться ею!","November 24, 2015","true","3.4"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","16","18","3","0"

Once you have picked your level you spawn as a pawn. The lowest ranked chess piece in the game with wandering other pieces. The objective at this point is to take out all other pieces and be the last one standing. To do this you need to reduce all your enemies energy to 0 while not allowing yours to run out. This is accomplished in various ways. You can stun the enemy by using a sort of grenade made of your own life force and then drain their energy. You can allow the bombs that fall from the sky to take someone out and then steal their body or you can wait in the shadows and pick your time to strike.  When an enemy is defeated you can switch bodies with it in order to raise your rank and get new abilities / more damage. The trick is that enemies do not attack higher ranked pieces so by killing and taking bodies you put the edge in your favor.\n\n\nOverall the game is worth a play if you have a fairly good imagination and don't mind having to work a little for your depth of gameplay.\n\nIf you simply want to shoot chess pieces because who wouldn't... this game might not be for you.\n\nOverall 6/10\nWith a very minimalistic approach Urja has a solid idea and a clean cut execution but it lacks a lot of content that could have made it really shine.

In every land it’s the same. Welcome to Urja, a single player first-person shooter, but with a twist. You won’t be playing as a career criminal, mowing down innocent civilians in a drive-by, and you won’t be playing as a spoilt brat trying to rescue his friends from a jungle warlord either. No, you’ll be controlling one of the world’s oldest game characters, the chess pawn, as you attempt to overthrow your superiors and take control of the king’s throne.\n\nYou won’t be trapped as a pawn for long though, if you can kill a higher ranking piece, or “entity”, that is. Entities carry a life-force inside of them known as “energy”. Energy has a dual purpose, and as well as acting as your life bar it also acts as your ammunition. Using it you can fire debilitating shots at your enemy. A well-aimed shot will incapacitate them temporarily allowing you to get up close and literally suck the life out of them. But wait, there’s more! Once you’ve killed a higher ranked entity you can become them. As you move up the ranks you become stronger, faster and gain special powers. The knight has the much sought-after ability to erect a shield to protect him from incoming attacks. The rook can create temporary glass structures to blockade doorways and ensnare unsuspecting entities. As a man of God, the bishop has been bestowed with the ability to resurrect the dead, bringing them back into the fray. You’ll have a hard time reaching those ranks though, never mind taking the king’s throne from him!\n\nUrja puts a fresh spin on a genre suffering from identikit “shoot this, now that” titles. How would I sum it up? It’s approachably simplistic and devastatingly addictive, with a learning curve that’d make Kasparov cry for his mother.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDisclosure: I was provided a promotional Desura key by HadrianYork so that  I could write a preview of the game.","January 9, 2015","true","3.6"," 32 of 51 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","32","51","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealcormano/recommended/338710/","therealcormano","Zamir GOAT [MLG Monkey King]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealcormano/","467 products in account","This is legitimately the worst game I have in my Steam Library. And I'm a Humble Bundle/IndieGala/BundleStars addict, so I have hundreds of games in my library.\n\nI actually feel defrauded of the money I spent on this game based on the top-ranked "Most Helpful" Positive reviews.\n\nA Chess-Based FPS/Puzzler? Are you kidding me?\n\n\nHere's what this game actually is:\n\nYou spawn in a floaty, disembodied, frictionless, ultra-shiny world FPS map that feels more like a badly-programmed HL2:DM custom map then anything else.\n\nYou walk around to see a bunch of AI opponents, almost all of a higher level than you.\n\nThis is where the "Chess-based" element comes in. You see, there's a hierarchy of power levels of these opponents! The strongest is the King, and will instantly one-shot you if he wants to! Then there's the Queen, who will instantly one-shot you, the Bishop and Rook, who will instantly one-shot you, and the Knight, who is the second weakest after you (the Pawn), and so only might instantly one-shot you. He might actually just knock you down and keep you stun-locked until you die.\n\nWell, there's also special abilities for a few of the units - the Rook, Knight and Bishop. For example, the AI Rook can instantly summon a floating block out of midair to deflect your fully-charged shot that you fired at him from point-blank range. Just like in Chess!\n\nThe "Puzzle" element of this game is that your goal on each FPS map is to kill and possess the bodies of each of the higher-ranked enemies than you. Unfortunately, the only attacks you have a chain-based energy leech - kind of like an inverse Medigun from TF2 - that is vastly weaker than your opponent's chain-based energy leech, and has much shorter ranger, and a floaty stun grenade projectile that shooting it takes away about half your life.\n\nThe onyl way to kill anyone is to shoot them with the grenade (of which you can only fire one before having to find a ball of energy sitting randomly on the map and draining it to recharge), and hope they lie stunned for long enough for you to drain them completely. If they get up during the draining, the fact that their energy leech is faster than yours means you'll never overtake them and you'll definitely die. The AI never misses, so your loss is guaranteed.\n\nHowever, if any of the AI opponents see you attacking another AI, they'll swarm over and instantly one-shot you. I guess this is where the "Puzzle" element comes in. The "Puzzle" element apparently consists of hoping that the AI - which seems to wander around the map randomly - will wander into an isolated corner with sufficiently limited visibility that you can actual kill an opponent without being instantly one-shot.\n\nI cannot recommend you don't buy this game enough. I'm legitimately upset at the money I spent on this, and I got it when it was 75% off. There are unironically dozens of games on Steam you can get for less than I paid for this that will offer you 15x the gameplay experience had herein. For example, you could buy Depth of Fear: Knossos, or Dark Scavenger, or Botanicula, etc. etc. etc. Chivarly is regularly on sale for less than I paid for Urja, and Chivalry is a great game that's about as much based on Chess as this is. (It has Knights and Kings!)\n\nIf I can dissuade even a single reader of this review from purchasing this game, my work here will be complete.","April 7, 2015","false","0.8"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","2"

But, I was never into chess either, and I suspect that's the type of mindset they were aiming for. This game is hard, and requires a level of patience and extreme stealth that ultimately just starts feeling boring to me. Basically, in theory you work to quietly eliminate the chess pieces in order of the heirarchy and take their places until you work your way up to being King. Do so where other pieces can see you though, and it's game over as they all pounce and kill you. Not that I ever made it far enough to be King, though my lack of immediate familiarity with the pieces at first glance probably didn't help my quest either. I readily admit that the learning curve on this one frustrated me to the point of giving up. I just don't see a point in continuing to play a game for too long after any sense of fun is eliminated. I got it in a bundle, fortunately, so am not upset or anything. I would suggest though that this is only a game for those with a chess-playing kind of lengthy thought and intense strategy sort of mind.","June 14, 2015","false","2.0"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","12","16","2","0"

You play as a chess piece trying to kill other chess pieces by vampire draining their life essence. You essentially use your life to summon bombs that stun the other pieces and hope to completely drain their life before they get back up. But you have to play cautiously because if other pieces see you trying to kill one of their own, they will attack you. So you almost have to be sneaky about it.\n\nYou start as a lowly pawn and if you manage to kill a better piece, you can enter their body effectively becoming stronger. The higher ranked pieces like the Queen/King move faster and can drain life very fast. The Knight, Bishop, and Rook have special abilities which you can use or can be used against you.\n\nWhile the training difficulty seems reasonable, the normal game mode is extremely difficult and just seems unfair. There's about 10 or so different arenas. The goal is to kill all the other pieces in the arena.\n\nThere is no tutorial and it is not intuitive on how to play or what your objective is.

It seems like an easy task but once you start playing, you will notice that this isn't a game like others. You are a basic pawn and have no habilities. You have to "kill" your mates in order to reach a higher level/piece and get higher skills. But add to this task the fact that your mates doesn't allow you to attack others in the same way that others wont attack you. This makes you stealth and wait for a good oportunity to enter in the body of the others pieces.\n\nGraphically the game looks kinda nice. The atmosphere and maps gives you a calm gameplay where you can think your strategy without rush. There is no frustrating music or anything that could distract you.\n\nIf you are searching a different game to spend some hours thinking, this is your game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/highpawn/recommended/338710/","highpawn","Highpawn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/highpawn/","39 products in account","TL;DR: Urja is a difficult game that is ultimately worth playing (maybe not at the $10 price tag) so long as you take the time to learn how it's played, understand it's more of a strategy game than an FPS, and like a challenge. Also, starting on the Bezier or Octagon map is probably best because they're easier.\n\nUrja is a difficult, though not impossible, game. In my opinion, it is worthwhile to play, despite having definite flaws. I think enough reviewers here have gone over the general gist of the game, so instead I'll list what I perceive to be the pros and cons, and then go over some important aspects of the game.\n\nPros:\n+ Unique, innovative concept for a game\n+ Aesthetically pleasing appearance. Sleek, something appealing in its looks\n+ Charming sounds--fits the game well\n+ Different levels require different strategies, tactics\n+ Varying level of difficulty between levels (though all hard!)\n\nCons:\n- Starting screen (explained below)\n- Steep learning curve. I don't consider this a con, but some do, so I included it here\n- Only two difficulty modes\n- Unforgiving nature if you screw up\n- Pricey at $10\n\nFrom the onset, I want to say this is more a strategy game where timing is essential than it is a traditional FPS. Those who try to play it as a traditional FPS will experience frustration. You can't go try to shoot the first higher-ranking piece you see because, most likely, you'll be in a position where another piece sees you, and then you're dead 95% of the time.\n\nIn order to be successful at this game, I think there are two major keys:\n\n1) Understand how the game is played!\n\nI can tell from a lot of the negative reviews that some people just never learned how to play. In part, that's a fault of the game. One of the issues is that the starting screen is white, and the game directions, option to change your name, option to change difficulty, etc. are all very small and gray. It's clear from the reviews that some people missed these options (I did not have this problem, but I can understand how it's an issue). Changing the text to black is pretty much a must, since the devs are turning off some players from the get go since they can't even see the explanation for how to play.\n\nApart from that, I think you just need to give the game enough playtime to figure out everything, since the instructions are not exhaustive. You have to figure out how to manage your energy (which is also your life), how other pieces' abilities work, what the general range/speed of each piece is, and how the AI works.\n\nI was watching a video of someone play the game for the first time earlier today. He found the instructions, but still felt there was something he was missing because he thought he kept getting attacked and couldn't see who was doing it. That would be pretty frustrating for sure. He ended up playing for 25 minutes before deciding the game wasn't for him. What he didn't realize is that he wasn't getting attacked--it was just that there are falling globs of energy (the thing you suck up), and when they fall near you they temporarily stun you. It's something he would've realized with more playtime, but never got to that point. If you're extremely frustrated and have just started playing the game, chances are that there's something you haven't quite figured out yet.\n\n2) Figure out a strategy for beating each level\n\nNow this is the fun part, in my opinion! Each level has different elements that dicate how your interaction with other pieces should go. Some levels are pretty open, some have good hiding spaces, there is high ground, low ground, small and large maps, etc. There's also a different number of enemy chess pieces in each level, ranging from 1 (this level you're going one on one with the King) to I think 15. Developing a strategy, testing it out, and making adjustments if it doesn't work is a fun and satisfying component of this game. The FPS part of the game is if you can execute that strategy. As general advice, the key to any strategy (in my experience so far--I have not played all the maps extensively) is timing. Know when you should attack, and when it's best to simply wait.\n\nGeneral Thoughts\n\nOverall, I really like this game. Once you learn how to play it, it becomes a lot of fun. There's something addicting about it, where the more you play it, the more you start to like it. It seems to me the more time you invest in the game, the more you'll get out of it.\n\n$10 is probably too high of a price tag for this game, considering the multitude of other very fun games you can get for $10 or less on Steam. Honestly, I was fortunate that I got it for $0.99, but I've gotten enough enjoyment out of it, and expect to get even more, such that I'd have been fine paying $10. For the average player, I'd say if this game seems like something you'd be interested in and you're willing to learn how it's played, then purchasing this for anything around $5 would be a worthwile buy. If you're more uncertain I'd only pay a few dollars for it.\n\nThere are some distinct areas where the game can improve. First off, changing the starting screen to make everything more visible would be a huge plus. Adding multiplayer to this game could be really fun. I think I read somewhere they have these plans in place, but I could be wrong.\n\nAlso, maybe providing a rating system for difficulty of each stage would be useful. Stage selection works such that you're in a black room with portals to each level. Bezier and Octagon are the easier stages (in my experience so far) I think, and to be fair the game always starts you off so that you're facing Octagon.  Because of this, I assumed this was the "starting" level. If someone randomly plays the first dozen times on the hardest levels, they might be inclined to quit immediately and miss out on the game.\n\nThe best change that could be made would probably be to add another level of difficulty where the AI is still tough, but not literally perfect. I saw a review here that said the easier difficulty is too easy. I've only played on it twice (won once, lost once) so I can't exactly comment on that, but if true then an intermediate difficulty setting would be welcome.\n\nIf you get the game, I hope you enjoy the challenge!","May 7","true","8.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

First off, the game is a FFA. There are no teams. Or, if there are teams, you're not on either side. Pieces don't move like chess pieces. The only thing that makes them different from one another is a single power that they use. The knight makes a shield, the rook makes a block of cover, and the bishop revives peices. Best part? You have no allies, so basically when you use the bishop's power, the piece you revived just comes to life and attacks you. Wow...\n\nThere's no campaign. The tutorial is a single page of text. There's no multiplayer. The only mode is multiplayer deathmatch with bots. I only played the game for 15 minutes, and I pretty much saw everything. I checked.

I'll gladly update this review should things change.\n\nFirst of all, I like the aesthetics of this game - sleek, interesting patterns and more.\n\nThere is no tutorial, only a help-screen with the basic rules. This is a problem.\nLet me list a few issues this causes.\n\n1. Every unit has an energy-state. This energy-state is used both to use a special explosive discharge-weapon and as health. If your energy runs out, you're dead. What isn't mentioned is the fact that if your energy is full, you can't drain energy from another piece - you have to fire more explosives to be able to drain more. This is really annoying since you might not be in a situation where you want to do so.\n2. I don't know if there's a detection range in this game or if it is line of sight only.\n3. How on earth does call for help work and why is it in the game? I have yet to experience needing that button since the high-rank pieces only sap energy for a second from the lower-ranking pieces.\n\nOther issues:\n1. Some of the levels are also a bit too open which makes for really stale gameplay. If you're spotted, it is basically over.\n2. Random elements play a huge factor: in one game the king piece dropped dead right in front of me for no apparent reason.\n3. Once you've grabbed  another piece, the game becomes easier. The hardest phase of each game is the pawn-phase.","April 2, 2015","false","2.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

One pawn being you. The object is to be the last one standing. Each character's life force is represented by an orb of light within its base.\n\nYou have 2 main abilities:\n- Drain, in which you gather (i hear slurping in my head while this is going on)  life force, either from random drops and scraps around the stage, or from other characters;\n- and Attack, in which you lob (quick click) a portion of your life force like a grenade or blast (hold and release) whick comes out like a cannon.\n\n- These attacks seem to do a little damage to enemy's health (as well as consuming some of yours) but mostly just stun them for about 3-5sec for you to get a free feeding.\n- Once an enemies been attacked or fed on, whoever did it will then be a targeted enemy. Be it you or another AI, and once a life force is completely drained, a character is dead...obviously.\n- Once an enemy is dead, you have the option to take over their body. And the higher ranked pieces have the benefit of faster movement, unique abilites and farther reaching and more powerful slurping action.\n\n\nDon't let my play time fool you. The concepts are very easy to pickup once you start playing.\n\n\nMy strategies:\n- Target an isolated enemy, hit him with an attack and rush up and drain. If you fill yourself full of energy before he's completely drained, toss a quick grenade into empty space and finish him off. Take his body and continue.\n- Follow around clustered enemies, watch and wait for them to fight amongst themselves and pick off the losers.\n- In stages with falling deaths, wait till groups of enemies are gathered together near a drop and bomb the bunch.\n- When attacking the knight, attack him from behind as he can block from the front.\n- Take the bishop out early as he can revive fallen enemies.\n\n\nNotes:\n- If it seems like enemies are targeting you when you havent messed with them, its because one of your attack's blast radius also hit them. Watch the AI attack each other or one of the random attacks from the sky, the blast radius is fairly large and it doesnt take much to irratate the enemy.\n- I don't recommend draning enemies to try to kill them unless you are a higher ranked piece and they already have low life.\n- Though challenging, you should not be overwhelmed if you have any tactical sense. If it seems too hard, you need to reconsider your tactics.\n- The only thing luck really seems to be a factor on is how fast you can beat a stage. Just depends on if the chess pieces fall into the right place. (wink)\n- Rounds are usually pretty short so this is a great game for when you only have a few minutes to spare.\n\n\nI picked this up in a bundle from bundlestars.com and am thrilled with it. Def worth it especially if its on sale.\n\nGreat job from a small developer. I look forward to burning many more hours on this one.","April 8, 2015","true","1.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Full price 9.99$ for this game is not reasonable due to it having no actual content, Now lets find out why.\n\nSo the game you start and type name and change difficulty or graphic settings, And then click play.\nThen you spawn in a dark room with 12 portals leading to 12 levels, Seriously the levels are very well designed they look so great and so different from each other, Some are small with a few enemies, And some are larger with more enemies.\n\nThere is ONLY one mode in the game, I Don't know if they're planning on adding more or making any more updates, If they are please let me know, But well its only one mode now, Which is basically ( Last Man Standing )\n\nWhen you first start the game you will be confused as hell, It has no tutorial or explains what to do, So just press F1 to bring the menu that explains what to do.\nBasically is WASD For movement mouse for aiming, Left click to drain energy, Right click to charge and shoot energy to damage enemies, C To cry for help ( So they come for you ) and F for your special ability ( if you have one ). also there are a few so press F1 to read.\nWhich also leads me to another disappointment, Abilities ... only 3 pieces has them, Bishop, Rook and Knight.\nAs for the rest they have no abilities except that the queen and king just move faster and drains energy faster ( The higher the rank your piece is the more energy it absorbs per second, and faster movement )\n\nThe goal is to be the last one standing, So you kill all the rest.\nBut if you attack one while the others are close, They will all turn around at you and completely annihilate you, So there is some stealth requirements in this game, You can lure some away from the others and kill them.\nFirst knock them down, While they're down you press and hold left click to suck their energy and once depleted they die, When they die you can press Space To transfer your character to the other piece ( better to always change pawn due to it being the weakest ).\n\nThe AI in the game is pretty tough on normal mode, They are very hard and intelligent, They keep activating their special abilities whenever needed, And once they see you start charging they keep dodging you and preparing for your attack.\n\nThere are also random energy bombs that falls from the sky and could kill you or them, Also some levels has holes so you can knock them into one to destroy them.\n\nThe game has no music, Just sound effects which are good but kinda needed some calm music or whatever I don't know.\n\nSo I hope I explained why I think its not really worth the full price, I mean if it had more modes and/or options to edit the AI number to make the game more interesting I'd be all over it, But sadly it has this and you have to deal with it ...\n\nConclusion\nSo this game is really fun, You'll have fun for about 4 hours, And then spend some time trying to break the leaderboard records, The maps are really great and unique, The graphics are pretty nice, But there is only one mode and no options to edit the number of enemies in one game or anything , Just difficulty option ( Trainer, Normal )  So the game does not really have that much content.\n\nSorry for the review being short and looks weird, But its just the game did not really provide me with much to work with.","April 1, 2015","true","3.0"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","4"

This is what fascinated me in Urja right from the start, as a cautiously started to explore one of the 12 game worlds.\nMy first steps in were filled with fright, especially because I did not know what to expect. Then, a pawn came in front of me and started to attack. This is when I started to understand the game mechanics, which I personally think that they are very easy to learn.\n\nI liked the fact that Urja has nice graphics, because it makes the most of its engine in order to create a believable world. At the same time, I like that the developers managed to make different, exciting worlds to explore, because I usually get bored fast when playing the same map over and over.\n\nI enjoyed the AI as well, because it does pose some challenges. In fact, at the beginning of the game it literally kicked my ♥♥♥ until I managed to understand how the game plays out. It’s so cool that knights, rocks and bishops have different abilities, because it literally game a whole new way to experience chess, a game I truly enjoy playing all the time.\n\nWhile I was a little skeptical to get this game at first, I found it to provide lasting value at a decent price. I got it for full price and I feel that I got my money’s worth, in fact I come back from time to time in order to play some rounds. It’s nice to have the leaderboards integrated there, because I always get the incentive to come back after playing Skyrim or other AAA titles. Urja for me is the perfect relaxation game while I get out of an MMO, and it does its job perfectly. Without too many or hard game mechanics, this is just a pleasure to play, and I feel that it’s so good I literally made 4 of my friends to purchase it! Yeah, it might not be multiplayer, but I feel that in singleplayer you get a lot more depth.\n\nTo be honest I never thought that a chess game can be scary, engaging and action packed. I always felt that chess is a game of strategy, but Urja successfully manages to shift the focus of this ancient game and change it towards a new direction. I really feel that this is a great title which was well worth my money. While I usually don’t write reviews for the games I own, I think that this one receives my praise, as it’s one of the few games on my large Steam list I could actually connect to. I would advise you to check it out and remember, “kill the bishop”!\n\n9.5/10","March 31, 2015","true","5.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

Notwithstanding how apparently straightforward this FPS "riddle" is, it is really addicting and extremely disappointing.\n\nFirstly, I was surprised by the name – Urja. I was constrained to find it to check whether it composed with the style of the game itself. There have been a few passages the extent that what it implies. It could mean Eminent, in the same way as my demise, Invigorating (Or uneasiness, as I like to utilize), and exertion, which you require a great deal of to get the hang of it. Evidently that "Urja" is the ideal title for this outside the box game. I can forget its hard-mode and hours of disturbance in light of the fact that the idea, gameplay, and representation are exceptionally well done.\n\nIn spite of the fact that the game doesn't have an out and out story, it is adroitly sound. You begin as a pawn with a limited measure of vitality in a guide of your picking, with different Chess pieces. The goal is to take their vitality while keeping your own up. All the pieces do something valuable for them and the further up the ruler step you go, the more risky it gets to be.\n\nAssaulting a pawn implies the pawn will assault you. The others simply move around, taking vitality balls off the floor before any other individual can. When the pawn is down (in the event that you can get the pawn down) the following best move is to strive for the Bishop. He can restore any piece that is gone down, making it the number 2 target. Ideally, with enough aptitude, you can proceed onward to the knight, who has a shield, et cetera. The more you execute, the more vitality you are permitted to have and use for the following piece.\n\nOn the off chance that you choose you have the ideal shot to bring down a higher piece initially, in the same way as the Knight for instance, each piece positioned beneath that Knight WILL come after you. That is the reason I propose the step system. Begin from the base and work some way or another up. The idea is similar to the diversion Fish, where you are a fish that can just consume littler fish until you get greater, and inevitably you consume the entire biological system. Despite the fact that your triumph isn't that excellent when you finish a round, you do get your name on a fairly vacant pioneer board. That ought to put some point of view on the trouble of this game.With each guide, there's another and amazingly composed world. No corner was left without some lovely detail to occupy you from the confusion within reach. It is carefully enriched, similar to the Entities you are pursuing. There is truly no issue with lighting and no glitching. There didn't appear to be any feature or sound settings, yet its one of few diversions I've played that needn't bother with them.\n\nI accept the potential in Urja is keeping pace with the improvement. Should they extend, I am certain the game will just show signs of improvement. Until further notice however, there are sufficient planets, procedures, and traps to keep this game around for some time. It's a breath of serious and outside air in the FPS series, one that was greatly requied.\n","March 11, 2015","true","0.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The main menu is a mess as the various menu texts are hard to see, not to mention that they are scattered around the corners of the screen.  There is a help feature, though it doesn't go over some of what you need to know (how you die and how to kill another piece).  Essentially, each piece has an energy reserve...if it empties, they die.  You can suck energy from other pieces or from globs of energy sitting on the ground and you can even use some of it to launch a "grenade" of sorts to stun other pieces (though it doesn't appear to hurt them).  While they're down though, you can sap the energy from the base of their piece.  It's not a bad game, but I wouldn't recommend it at the $10 price tag, what with no multiplayer and lack of different game modes.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9bEYyKWUow","January 10, 2015","false","0.5"," 15 of 32 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","15","32","0","0"

What it is, is a unique spin on the idea of chess and fighting the other pieces.  Its not like Battlechess, where each fight follows the rules of chess, rather a hierarchal battle of the ranks of royalty.  No good or bad, just you ( a pawn) fighting the rest of the players.  Like many have other reviewers have stated, there is a definite pattern to the kills, i dare you to start for the King 1st.  And like others have stated, there is no story, so heres my version:  Your King has gone wicked mad, a virus has infected him and he sees you, a lonely pawn, frontline fodder, as his greatest enemy.  So he orders all of his subordinates to find you and execute you.  You see they have a special skill set that helps them do that.  So you must do what every pawn dreams of, and thats kill the King.  Ok.\n\nPros:\nThe graphics are beautiful, simple and sharply colored\nIts not a resource hog\nAI is kinda brutal, refreshing for new games these days\nComplex, you cant simply jump in and hunt, you have to watch then act\n\nCons:\nNo tutorial, may leave some scratching the ole neck beard\nno controller support, this is one title im really disappointed didnt have this\ncould reallly use a few tweaks in the response department, it feels slower than it should be\nno multiplayer, this one would be a blast if it had it.\n\nBottom line:\nIt could be a beautiful masterpiece with just a few tweaks and adds, which would also make well worth the money.  As it stands the cons are really detracting from the game.  So buy it on sale, or a bundle, but steer clear of the full price.  An understanding of the chess is nice, but nothing really deep is required so little kids my enjoy this one.\n\n6/10...add controller support and multiplayer!\n","March 27, 2015","true","1.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

You can press F1 to get some vague instructions but that's crap. If I wanted to read a book then I wouldn't be playing video games right now. Video games have their own methods of delivering information (through game play) which are completely missing from this experience. There is no reason why this game can't walk new players through how to play it with an interactive tutorial other than incompetence or laziness on the part of the developer and that, by itself, is ample justification for a negative review at this point.\n\nDespite it looking beautiful with it's crisp asthetic and chess motif, I would not recommend this at $10 and would find it a headscratcher whether or not to recommend it at $1. (I picked it up in a bundle) It may have wonderful FPS mechanics but if so, they're hidden behind a barrier to entry which is so completely unnecessary that the sheer magnitude of this bad design choice is just staggering. If an interactive tutorial is added later then that would change things, but at this point, I just don't see how anyone who isn't friends with the developer could recommend it.

Not as it is. I'll try to break it down:\n\nTHE PROS:\n+It has beautiful graphics. Probably one of this game's biggest strengths. Everything about this game is visually appealing.\n+It's easy to learn how to play this game.\n+It's relatively stable gameplay-wise. I have seen a few minor hiccups, but overall it's mostly bug-free.\n\nTHE CONS:\n-From the start this game is stacked against you to a ridiculous level. You start out as the weakest unit and have to work your way up by attacking stronger units and taking control of them, thus gaining their strength. The biggest problem in this is that once you attack a unit, all other units in the area will attack you. In order to be able to perform a succesful attack, you have to wait until a unit is isolated before attacking. In addition units can call out for help, which they usually do when they see you attacking them (and they usually do, since they start staring at you if you get close to them). To top it all off, the three "specialized" units (the rook, knight, and bishop) add an extra level of difficulty. Though the rook's power isn't too advantageous, the knight's can be a bit unfair, although the unit doesn't seem to use it that much, and the bishop's is frustrating to no end. It is, in fact, best to go after the bishop first, since any units that are taken down before the bishop can be quickly revived. The bishop's power also has no advantage for the player, since player-revived units aren't allied with the player, but instead go back to their normal jobs. There is therefore no benefit in reviving enemies.\n-There aren't any achievements. I do realize that this is a bit nitpicking-y, but I feel like for any FPS game there should be at least 1 of either multiplayer, a story mode, or achievements to make it worth playing. To be fair, this game does have a leaderboard, which I'll get to now.\n-The leaderboard seems broken. When I beat one of the levels, I was told that my time (5 minutes) wasn't my best. apparently, I was already on the leaderboard (with my name being "unknown") with a time of 2 minutes. I was very much confused at this, since I was never asked for a name (I assumed that the game would get it from my Steam name), and because it was the first time that I had sucessfully completed any level. Also, there were still slots in the leaderboard, so it wasn't that I just didn't fit.\n\nAll in all, I'd say that for right now it isn't worth getting.","November 24, 2015","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Honestly.\n\nI like the idea, in theory. Chess pieces fighting against each other in a FPS-style is a great idea, and it could have been incredibly fun. But no. There's no tutorial to tell you any idea of what you should do, just a little question mark on the main screen that you might pass over if you're not paying attention (which I did). Once you realize the game isn't going to tell you what to do, and find your way back to the main screen and click that question mark, it basically just tells you "you're supposed to shoot the other pieces and steal their energy, good luck!"\n\nSo now you know what to do. You go back to the game, shoot an enemy... and are immediately swarmed by every other piece in the surrounding area. It's uncanny how the other pieces are able to find you, they just sort of appear even when you didn't see any around. And unfortunately the AI has perfect aim, so you're dead within a few seconds.\n\nSo you decide to try again, because you paid real money for this game, God damn it, and you're gonna get every penny's worth out of it if it's the last thing you do. And you die again. And again. And again. Then you get lucky and capture the Queen, so now you're the big dog with all the power, right? Wrong, enemies still kill you in just a couple of seconds, and you're no more effective at taking them out than you were as a pawn.\n\nThe AI is ridiculously hard, they're all perfect shots and can drain your life in just a few seconds, while your own aim is extremely difficult because not only are you forced to aim for just a small ball at the base of the other pieces, because body shots are too mainstream and only shots to the energy ball count, but even if you somehow manage to drain a bit of energy from an enemy, that damn energy ball gets smaller and smaller which makes it nearly impossible to hit. If you're able to stun an enemy, it will spend 90% of it's (incredibly short) stunned time in midair or rolling along, where the body gets in the way of your aim at that damn energy ball. The levels are way too big for a game like this, and I found myself spending most of the time just wandering the level trying to find another piece somewhere.\n\nOnce you finally sap all the energy from another piece, you can capture it. That should mean it's out of commission, right? Wrong. The enemy bishop will revive it. So you have to take out the enemy bishop too, or else you're facing an endless horde of enemies that can kill you super fast.\n\nIn case you couldn't tell by now, I'm super frustrated with this POS game. This is one instance where it's true that the only way to win is to just not play.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

You, a pawn, can only attack those in the same class as you, lest the rest of the system come toppling down on you; Call for Help is an action in-game and those above you will rally the others if Pawn gets out of line.\nActually, if you wander around the (beautiful!!) maps, it's kind of rare to see hostility between the other Entities. Even if you bump shoulders with one of them, it's not all that likely they'll attack you first. It seems you are, often, a lone revolutionary, striving to break free of the caste system.\nIf you manage to assassinate a superior, you can impersonate them.\nThe goal is to become King (of the Hill)(as in lone survivor).\n\nThat apparent hesitation in the AI to engage on their own, the necessity to aim precisely, the quickness with which Energy drains / the absolutely chaotic seconds that punctuate the long moments of nothing; veterans of "arena shooters" might have to alter their connotation of the term.\n\nI must advise other new players to view the Community Guide here on Steam, and just watch the first few minutes of the video therein, otherwise one might be quick to write the game off entirely.\nPerish the thought that "Oh, but it'd be fun to learn the game on my own," no, especially since, what with Urja being nothing but an arena shooter, the goal is to get as good as quickly as possible.\nI feel like the desire to fully glean how the game works wouldn't outlast the patience that most would have in pursuing such a goal. And if one tried and then went to the Guide, it might actually sour the experience that much more.\nCheck the corners of the screen when the game first boots up (don't instantly hit Play as I did); know that you can charge your shots (RMB); know you can shoot while leeching (LMB); know you can't jump, but you can lean around corners; realize that that bit of political bull-♥♥♥♥-ery I spouted earlier wasn't just bs, but actually part of the game.\n\n\nI recommend this game and don't think it's deserving of the Mixed user reviews at all, but I understand how the rating came to that.\n\nEDITed for spacing","August 8, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You see i got Urja from a indie bundle, so I didn’t care that it sucked, but then i saw the normal price, TEN DOLLARS USD FOR THIS! It's a huge rip-off, and just would be a waste of money for a game with so little gameplay. That's what made me a very annoyed.\nIf you like weird games, there’s a chance that you would like this game. There is a upside to the game if graphics are really nice for an indie game. If i rated games only on gameplay this game would be a 0/10, but i don't review games like that, sure gameplay is most of the rating, but sound, graphics and story are also a big role.\n\n1/10\n\nDisclaimer. Story is only added on for games that have a story.","May 2","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Seems like an abandoned prototype. You enter the game, you are standing in the middle of a bunch of orbs (presumably portals to the levels). One is called "finale", but there is no indication which levels are more or less difficult than the others. I figured I would work clockwise from the level to the right of "finale." Already I'm guessing. I walk through the Portal. I have read the F1 help, I know the rules of the game. I did manage to finish what (I'm only guessing) is the first level on Normal, ranking 10th all-time on the leaderboard, but only because of luck (I never took the king, or the queen - I assume they got blown off the floating gameboard by the random explosions that happen everywhere - a strange mechanic) but the second level (I think?) is impossible. It is a wide open platform, basically, and whenever you attack your target piece the 'fun police' (all chess pieces of higher ranking than you) attack you immediately when you begin charging your attack. You do not even have a chance to release the shot before you are taken out. It seems like there is no way to win except for completely blind luck. I enjoy the concept of this game, but the AI is unforgiving and omniscient. It needed a lot more time in the oven. I bought this game for $1 and it may be worth that, barely. For the regular asking price of $10 this is an absolute DO NOT BUY.","May 7","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, the entire experience just felt unpolished and bland. Urja feels like an abandoned student project, there are no menus in the game, and nothing I came across indicates to me that the developer cares about making this a good experience. The gameplay consists of wandering around various pieces of concept art, some of which span out on an apparently infinite plane, and waiting for pieces to isolate themselves so you can stunlock them to death before another one joins the party, then you can take its place. If another a higher ranked piece sees you do this you've basically lost, but rounds generally don't take long anyway. Higher ranking pieces almost completely outclass lower ranked ones, and have unique powers that I never really felt the need to use, but getting rid of bishops seems important. Some of the maps are definitely more fun and balanced than others, but after a brief session I already feel like I've experienced everything the game has to offer. It's an attempt, but not a remotely compelling one.","May 22","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
