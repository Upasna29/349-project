Their intent was to make a couple ♥♥♥♥ simulators and that's exactly what they did. Any publicity, is good publicity right? Not really, but good job. As far as the games go, it's open and shut. They are pure garbage, Controls are terrible, UI was done by a 12-year-old. The city or "New York" is clearly European. Same goes for the cars/assets and the THUMBNAIL doesn't even match you GAME NAME! Don't just take my word for it, give it a watch.

I completed the first three "missions" and if you have the stomach to go further maybe you will find yourself doing something other than accelerating, driving 10 meters and stopping, and opening the door to watch the an army of clones get on and off the bus. Then closing the door again. There is one character model. The citizens of NYC also have ghostly powers and can phase through your bus without incident. However, the fire hydrants are far from ethereal - hit one of these and you are surprisingly treated to water spurting many feet in the air. The attention to detail is staggering.\n\nThe city has been loving recreated and is instantly recognisable as New York, if New York consisted of three copy pasted buildings, and a few benches, and hundreds of bus stops that are 10 meters apart. And barely any other traffic. That's not to mention that they have cruelly turned NYC into a prison city by erecting huge impassable red walls to stop the ghost clones from getting out and destroying America. To be fair, a bus driving game set in the movie "Escape From New York" is a cracking idea for a video game, if you make this, please paypal me 10% of the profits.\n\nTo top it off, I believe the music has been taken from a 1980s soft core porno.\n\nThis is, IMHO, the second best game called New York Bus Simulator on Steam.","April 24","false","0.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","0"
