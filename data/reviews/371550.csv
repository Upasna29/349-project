"http://steamcommunity.com/id/commissarbro/recommended/371550/","commissarbro","CommissarBRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/commissarbro/","1034 products in account","This game is infuriating. Full of cheap tricks, with enemies who can attack just out of range of you and hard to read moves due to the pixelated nature of the graphics. However, it's also pretty fun and you can't help but yell out in joy when you finally bring down an opponent who has defeated you 15 times. The purpose of the game is you are a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Knight who walks from one end of a map to the other. You'll be faced with enemies that must be blocked, dodged and parried if you wish to make it to the end. You'll start with peasants with pitchforks and cattle and by level 2 you'll be fighting pikemen and horse-mounted lancers. The only way to defeat these enemies is to figure it out, step by step. There are no hints, no guides, no tutorials and no power-ups that will give you an edge in combat. It's just you, your dodge, your block and your sword. The difficulty is pretty high and potions that heal are far and few between, generally one per level. Oddly enough, it makes me think of a side-scrolling Dark Souls due to the unforgiving nature and the expectation that you will die... a lot... until you figure out how to defeat your enemies.\n\nEssentially, I found this game to be frustratingly hard but every little victory felt like I had overcome all the odds and I could see I was getting better at the game. For the low price and the relatively simple concept, I would definitely recommend this one to masochists.\n\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_cYJPMG2j0","March 10","true","2.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","100","8","8","6","0"

I really like the basic idea behind it: three attacks (low, mid, high) and three blocks as well as a dodge roll are your moveset to conquer various foes each with their own unique moves. Studying the enemies and learning distances, timings as well as when to block and at which position could be great fun and to an extent are.\n\nHowever, the game is very hard to read and suffers from it - it is not exactly obvious which attack is which and how to block 'em. In order for this title to work really well, the various attacks and stances would have to be much more distinct and telegraphed better. It kinda works the way it is, but it is frustratingly hard - hard because it is not very well done rather than complex or particularly skillful. The game also lacks in the motivational department - having to replay each stage (as short as they are) in order to try your hands at bosses again quickly becomes boring and even punishing - especially when you figured the stage out and there is nothing to gain in experience or knowledge from foes.\n\nGood concept, not so good execution. Would try out a sequel that was more visually pleasing, fixed the things mentioned above and maybe introduced counter attacks / one-hit kill techniques / disarmament. A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'s Tale as it is, is very niche and not exactly for everyone, myself included.","June 13, 2015","false","2.0"," 25 of 40 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","25","40","0","0"

I bought it at a really low price, and wasn't expecting much, even after playing the first level. When I got to the boss of the second level, I knew the game would change drastically. Enemies were much more challenging and brutal, and each one had a very different way of being fought. When I beat the game I almost cried because it was hard, but fun at the same time, because if I died, it was because I didn't have enough reflexes.\nThe game itself is very simple. You just need to parry at the right position and counter attack, rolling is also an option. The endless fighter mode is an endurance test to see how many enemies you can defeat in a row, restoring health each 10 enemies you kill, there's a lot of frustration and fun to be had.

On the controller, the attack buttons (overhead chop, l>r slash and, r>l slash) are bound to the SAME buttons as the blocking buttons.  Why is this?\nIt is a mystery...\n\nCould the l-pad not just block when you use the block button?  Can we not find a way to progress faster than 2 sprite widths in as many seconds? or give me jump?  The dodge-role is massively unuseful in this respect, the idea of propelling myself 10 seconds worth of game time shuffling back from an enemy I have to get within a gnat's crotchet of anyway is less than appealing.\n\nThe premise is simple and honest: no RPG elements, no overpowered weapons or classes or anything.  Just one guy, one-dimensional plane of existence and an inherent requirement within our heart of hearts to travel from left, to right and to ♥♥♥♥ up anyone we meet.  The sprite design and animation are a particular labour of love in this and the artistry is appreciated but in reality, the game plays like a game of e-mail rock, paper, scissors.  Often I will be told to anticipate 3 charging bulls in quick succession (which I usually find are quickest despatched by 3 quick downchops), but 50% of the time it glances off the bulls horns or some ♥♥♥♥ing garbage to the dissapointing *ting* of my poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ going into a recovery animation that, sadly, he is not invulnerable for.  The bulls will plow into me with impunity 1..2..3.. and THEN, on the next run, they're all staggered together from where they hit me and (to my axperience so far) it is not possible to carry out a double kill in the game.\n\nThe game is hard as ♥♥♥♥♥ and really consists of only one mechanic.  I really like it and will play a lot of it, no doubt, but the game is essentially that Conan game for NES where you kick skeletons in the ♥♥♥♥ and not much else.  It is not deep or grindy at all (what is that even supposed to mean? what is there to grind??)

It looked like a great game, but it is really quite bad. The controls are pretty nonresponsive and clunky. It's pretty awkward unless you have a controller too. It isn't very fluid at all, and just feels really heavy. The enemies you face both control and move a lot better than your character. The combat (which is most of the game) just feels cheap. The enemies can move and attack or block at the same time. While your character can only move OR block and attack. This makes it harder for you to complete and really, like I said before, just feels clunky. The strategy for most battles and bosses is just attack first, or block for long periods of time and wait for an opening. You cannot chain attack combos or anything but the enemies can, so if you make a mistake, you are likely going to lose an excessive amount of health.\n\nTo be honest, I've played free games on Gamejolt and Newgrounds that were better than this game. It might have been a fun game for free, but it was certainly NOT worth the money. If the developer wanted to sell their game, they should have cleaned it up and made it more presentable.

The first level teaches you the basics with no exposition leaving you to fend for yourself and learn how to overcome simple enemies though use of parry and dodge. This is good game design and I rather enjoyed it.\n\nThen came the second level and you're fighting a professional looking soldier type with barely any telegraph on his attacks due to using a one handed sword and his body being in the way of his sword arm. Annoying but not inhumanly fast or anything (later I found out you could literally just spam attacks at him and win) I came to the next enemy, simple timed swing on his lance kills him instantly, and the next which was a fun bit of puzzle solving as how to dispatch him followed by a quick middle finger as he dies in the form of throwing his spear into the air. You then fight sword guy and rider guy again and then come up against your clone more or less.\n\nThis knight does not really telegraph his attacks and the only way to damage him is to (I think at least as the visual design never made it explicitly clear) parry him at the last possible second and whack him with an overhead. This is the part where the game goes down hill, as the knight is more or less a palette swap of you and thus I'm not sure his sprite was designed with the intention of the player being able to read his attacks in mind. If he was designed with that in mind then I can't say the dev succeeded.\n\nTo eventually learn his move set isn't impossible and to be honest I was getting closer by the time I decided the game was no longer fun to play. The main issues are that once you've bested the stage enemies once or twice they're both easy and very boring to fight, your character moves like a moss covered sloth, and you are most likely not beating a boss without grinding through goons to learn his move to muscle memory because you likely won't be able to by eyesight alone.\n\nIf you're either super MLG pro and think I'm just being a weenie babby, or simply ok with a bit of grind and drudgery then  go for it, you'll likely enjoy this more than I did. For others, you'll probably not enjoy this too much, though at 1$ you might be able to justify it for the pretty art.","March 9","false","0.5"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","2"

Would be great if they doubled (at least) the frames per animation so you could tell what the hell the enemy is doing.

Full game is garbage.\n\nLevel 1 is exactly the same as the demo and it conveys a harsh but fair sense to the player about the gameplay.\n\nLevel 2 immediately betrays this trust developed with the player by having enemies with almost non-existent wind-ups and questionable indicators of how they will swing at the player. Even after you overcome that aspect, one enemy with death throes tosses his spear up and instead of coming straight down, IT STARTS TRACKING THE PLAYER FOR NO LOGICAL REASON AND IS UNBLOCKABLE.\n\nThis is what's called trolling your customers.

First level, kinda tough.  Second level, much harder and the mechanics already start to break down.  Enemies that can rapidly attack whether you block or not so its more rewarding not to.  Then the boss FORCES you to use the block mechanic.  The problem is not only do you have to react to his attacks with the correct block, but he can also cancel his attacks mid-swing.  So if you move back or stop blocking he can just stop his swing, no lag.  Didn't bother getting passed him, broken garbage.","January 13","false","0.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It really gives that tense to you. You can feel that hit. You can feel that victory inside you. IT IS SO COOL! The only thing I didn't like is that characters repeat it self.
