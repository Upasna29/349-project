It does what it sets out to do very well.  That said, I won't be playing it because it's not my style of game.  It's not a space 4x game but a casual simplistic strategy came set in a space theme.\n\nWhat the game appears to be from the advertising is a simplified, casual, 4x turn-based space strategy game.  It isn't.  I could really enjoy a game like and keep playing it for a lengthy period of time.  It needs to have just a few more mechanics and a few more complexities to be a 4x.  For example, there is no eXplore in this 3x game.  That goes along with no research, no empire management, no ship customization, no planetary development.  Well, heck, it's not a 4x game at all!  That's my one warning, you will be very upset if you buy this expecting that (yes, I know it says it on the store page advert, honestly I don't know why they would advertise it as such).  Let me explain what it actually is.\n\nIt's a space themed table top strategy game.  It's Risk with space ships on a check board.  No more complex than that.  It's not a 4x, not Endless Space, nor MOO, nor SOTS, nor Stardrive, etc.  It's a bad decision to advertise it as this genre.  You have a checker grid of planets with each having a set number of Resource points.  Capturing the planet means you gain those resource points each turn.  Each planet can construct ships and the cost is subtracted from your resource bank.  You have cards with some strategic value, i.e. your ship will suicide next battle and kill itself and all enemy ships, which can also be traded for resources.  There are essentially two races, the Empire and, essentially, rebels/Pirates.  They have different play styles whereas the Empire has stronger ships, combat strength and health, they take longer to build and more resources.  The Pirates have weaker ships and take less turns to build.  So the pirate early game is sprawl as fast as you can before the Empire starts coming.  The ships are each different resource costs, turns to build and stats.  The battles are simply graphical representations of the stat calculation.  It's like Civilization 5 where you have one unit attacking another, animations ensue, and the victor remains.  That's the game.  That's all there is.\n\nIt's a deeper checkers in Space. Perhaps that's unfair.  It's a very complicated Checkers game in space.  Think of the genre as on a range of complexity from a tabletop stragegy game to your traditional, archetypal, 4x PC game like MOO.  Within the table tops you can go from as simple as checkers to as complicated as Risk.  Your 4x games, I would say Endless Space would be the simplistic title, MOO/Sword of the Stars in the middle and the spreadsheet game of MOO3 as the most complex.  This game falls squarely in the complex table top game category and doesn't even touch the simplistic 4x scale.  That's what you're buying.  Don't expect a simpler Endless Space or even a casual 4x title because you'll be disappointed.\n\nWhat it does though, it does right.  The UI is crisp and looks good, the ships look good as does the space background.  Next to no game breaking bugs so far after 2 hours of gameplay and multiple play throughs.  Your games will last from about 10 minutes - 45 minutes.  It's very much a pick up and go strategy title.  For me though, it's still space checkers -- where you can own tiles you were on and build more checkers on them and each time you jump another player there's a battle based on numbers.  I'd recommend this for casual players and table top players, not necessarily 4x players.  There is a little polish lacking, it's day one after all, with some stuttering in the panning and some funky zoom decisions (click on planets to move around map, forget panning or zooming).  Also, damage on ships is hard to see or even even keep track of since it's not represented graphically or shown on the galaxy screen nor battle screen.  The other reviews criticised the game for having a scout take out a cruiser, fair enough, they can when your cruiser has 1 shield point left but you'd never know it during the battle.  That sort of detail isn't quite polished in yet.  I think $15 is a fair price point, $20 is pushing it in its current state, but maybe when it gets more polished and maybe with a little more content.","September 5, 2014","true","22.3"," 196 of 281 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","196","281","0","15"

If wants to be simple, but it also wants to do too much.\n\nThe ruleset is derpy. The card system, and the fact that moves are completed when a player finishes their turn (and not at the end of a round) means that players in different positions in the queue are at an advantage and disadvantage.\n\nThe races, while a neat idea, doesn't work all that well. For instance, one race only has more expensive vehicles. This works on paper, but when the gameplay essentially boils down to 'who zergs the most', it is a massive disadvantage.\n\nInformation in the game is presented through popup windows. And there's a lot of them. when you play you have to dismiss them all of the time. It's a bother and ultimately only serves to be a timewaste. Maybe if they'd done a proper GUI that need no user intervention it would have been better.\n\nAll of this is not mentioning the fact that a user can only move one ship at a time. Build hundreds of them, then try to move them. countless of dialogs means hundreds of clicks; one for each unit. It's just not worth your time.","December 11, 2015","false","413.7"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","18","18","0","2"

So my number of hours played is not that accurate.\n\nSo, let's talk about what I liked about the game first.\n\n1. The gameplay - it's a reminisence of chess, checkers and game of the generals. If you like playing board games and if you want a game that will challenge your strategic mind, then this game is for you. The gameplay mostly involves you pressing buttons in-game but pressing that button requires a lot of thinking first. "Will this benefit me later on?" "Is this the right choice?"\n\n2. The A.I. - damn, the A.I. is really frustrating to beat. I thought I was already winning most of my games only to realize I was suckered by the damn bots.\n\n3. The music - Suspense. I feel like I am in outer space duking it out with them aliens.\n\n4. The art - The game does not really on graphics too much. But it has some artworks that (may not blow your mind) will you appreciate the game more.\n\nWhat I hate about it.\n\n1. Lack of female presence - No female characters!? Whuuuuut!? Well there's the female brood mothers but I can't really tell if they're female! Comeon guys. You can easily add a female character in the game. You can just draw it you know.\n\n2. The music - I like how the feel of the music makes me think of space. But damn... I didn't know that outer space can be so repetitively annoying.\n\n3. No visual tutorials - The game is complicated. I was able to realize that it's all about pointing and then clicking and conquering planets after 20 minutes into playing the game. But that 20 minutes irked me so much that I actually prayed that the game does not exist. I mean, comeon.. This game is complicated, how much of a complication is it to make a tutorial that involves gameplay? Nobody reads written instruction (they have those) when you have the game in front of you. I didn't read it.\n\n4. Price - that price does not justify anything. It's not a competitive price. Change it somewhere lower and you will surely have more people buying the game\n\n5. Multiplayer - There's an option to play Multiplayer. But it's useless. Nobody plays the game online. Damn. I was hoping to play with someone online but damn.\n\nSo... There. That's my review. Do I recommend it? Yes. I do. But be wary, watch Youtube videos first to check if you will like the game once you have it. That price is not really making me happy. It's a good thing I snagged the game for free from the devs. I would definitely suggest that you buy if it ever goes on sale.\n\nFinal verdict: 5/10","November 2, 2014","true","7.9"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","30","40","0","0"

Because its not! But in a good way, read on!...\n\nThis is more like a space board game or at least you can play it like that. And its easy to get used to, no HUGE manuals needed. For example: You don’t need to research, mine or collect money by trade. Just invade planets and you get those resources added to your bank so you can build better ships for your invasions. Play against Ai players or team up against them. Or why not against human players online? The choice is yours.\n\nThere are several factions that you can play with. All with different benefits, so choose wisely.\n\nThere are also several game modes for this game:\n\nComplex For those who want a more advanced experienced game on a large map. Fog of war will hide unknown planets. You will be stepping on toes in some turns. Why? Well you dont wanna loose a planet wich is building a battlecruiser at the moment. :)\n\nBoard game This mode is for those who want a true board experience. In this game mode you will also find artifacts that will grant powerful passive abilities. You will also earn random cards wich you can play to get resources, better weapons, opponent looses 1 random planet and more. Good fun if I may add, try it.\n\nCustom Well kinda explains itself. Create your ultimate game with your choices of impact.\n\nNormal Is the mode i have been playing most for the moment. And the whole point is to have as much planets under your command so you can get more resources to buy more advanced ships to invade and conquer planets. Combat is straight forward. For example if you send a scout to a planet wich has a enemy fighter:\n\nScout Weapon: Lazer 2 - Shield 2  / Fighter Weapon: Lazer 2 - Shield 4 = Fighter wins because its shield is better.\n\nBe careful the enemy can build battleships same like you. So always inspect a planet before invading. And own as many planets as possible because that is your income.\n\nGFx 9-10 (Gfx is spot on for this game. Really nice and clean)\nSfx 8-10 (Sfx and music fits the game nicely. Would be cool if they added custom music)\nGameplay 9-10 (The easiest space strategy/board game i have ever played no fuzz just SWEET)\n\nIf you are looking for a more advanced strategy game with trading, research and diplomatic etc you wont find it here.  And honest, i dont miss it. The game is really good in what it does. Do i recommend this game: YES!.. Spot on game for a old man like me.

Don't give the game a negative review just because you expected something else.\n\nAs the game description says. It's a CASUAL 4x Turn-Based Strategy Game. Think of it like a board game. Just because you heard a 4x there don't think of Master of Orion or Endless Space. Read the whole description. Watch screenshots. Watch videos.\n\nBasically there are 4 factions each with 4 leaders. Each factions have different ships. The game is played like the old Hexxagon game where you take planets one by one by using the ships that you build. There is 1 resource. Each planet can give you from 0 to 2 points in that resource. Ships are also simplified. You have attack and hp. Combat is also automated.\n\nBesides this, you can also draw "cards" that you can use at your advantage.\n\nBasically is a game where you are trying to conquer as many planets as possible then try to defend them. It's a strategic game where you have to anticipate opponent's movement.\n\nYou can play with AI or with other Humans. You can play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, 2v2v2, etc.\n\nAgain, think of it like a board game. I sometimes like this games. Just pop in, play a couple of games. Keep my brain focused.\n\nI made a video where I explain the game in greater detail here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ONQoxIf7pM\n\nAgain. It's not the game's fault that you expect something else.\n\nP.S. There was a SAVE game bug that got fixed.

I was wrong.  If a game has mostly negative reviews, guess what, it isn't a good game.\n\nI tried 3 games:\n\nGame one, team play.  I lost track since another player and my units were the same color and it just turned into a muddled mess.  Hello, shouldn't the colors be the players rather than the factions?  And my teammates ships as well as my own would both be around some plantets, and I could not tell them apart.  Sometimes it seemed as if my ships were brighter, sometimes my enemies.\n\nGame two, 1-1 with different factions.  I made the mistake of leaving artifacts on in the vicotry conditions.  I won the game after finding 3 artifacts before even having a combat. Not fun.\n\nGame three, 1-1 different factions, artifacts off.  The AI proves it'self brain dead.  I took all the plantes.  During the game, I built 53 ships.  The AI? 4. yes 4.  I lost (automated combat) 15 ships to take out his 4. Either he only built tough ships, which is silly in a game where it is all about expanding fast, or he just did nothing.  Either way, too easy and not fun at all.\n\nGame four - easy - Uninstall.\n\nThis game has potential.   I really do think that a major overhaul could save the game.  As it is, pretty much everything about this game, from the way it scrolls to the Custom game setup, which really isn't custom (can't even pick the number of planets, it's dependent on which game you choose) is irritating.\n\nSome things that would help custom:  Color choice, planet number choice, difficulty choice.\n\nFix the AI.

The store page could not possibly be more misleading about what you are getting in this game.  This is not a 4x game in the very least. It is space themed checkers. The only win condition in the game is to control a majority number of the planets on the board. The default settings in game are that when you move to an unoccipied planet, you capture it. Generally I will have won the game long before any combat has happened between myself and an enemy faction. I feel completely ripped off by this game.

This is no where near a 10$ title, more like a 1.99 game that you still wait to go on sale. As such, it feels very much like a mobile port.\n\nWhat I liked... Graphically I thought the art team did their job. While nothing amazing or new, it was about average for a mobile level game. Thats about all I liked, but this is what happens when a few artists try to make a game in a genre they know little about.\n\nThe bad... to avoid a full wall of text ill just make a list.\n\n--Achievements dont unlock correctly - some early, some never\n--I opted to play without sound an hour in as it didn't add anything (changing the sound output also crashed the game)\n--All ships are available from the start, no tech tree at all\n--One resource that means nothing to you\n--Easy to spot bugs, such as capture 10 planets and game tells you that you captured 20\n--Terraform units, if used too many in a turn they either despawn without doing the job or the game fails to update planet output text- as I've seen mismatched output depending on where you look\n--The only choice I ever made was to stop bothering to terraform planets as there was no point and its tedious\n\n--THE USER EXPERIENCE IS THE WORST I'VE EVER SEEN!! In the credits there were testers... did they play this? How long? Cause holy ♥♥♥♥.\n~~I hope you like to click - if you are a steamroller like me... good luck. You have to move every unit one at a time, one planet jump at a time, each taking 3 clicks min. So my late game turns on a full size map required 500+ clicks until I just stopped moving majority of my units and won with the rest. I never lost a battle but settings might help up the challenge.\n\n--And another minor thing, is it a "turn" or a "round"... pick your terms and stick with them.\n\n-- The game summary is mostly lies - unless I missed everything by not playing the other "factions" so I'll review that real quick:\n\n"Leave the tedious, everyday tasks that take away from crafting and executing tactical strategies to your faction as you explore the galaxy. "\n\n--Crafting what? The best ship in the game, that you start with and have no reason to build anything else? That crafting?\n(This may have been a setting I randomly chose starting my first and only game, if so then my fault)\n\nExplore the galaxy map and discover different planet types: some rich in resources, some barren and unfit for terraforming. Expand your empire by choosing which planets to invade, colonize, destroy or simply ignore. Exploit and terraform planets, acquiring resources to grow and strengthen your fleet, empowering you to exterminate enemy factions and rule the galaxy.\n\n--What? Every planet I went to was automatically captured, and the only choice left was to bother terraforming it... or not based on 0-1-2 output levels. So you could capture a 0 and make it a 2, thats literally it.\n\n"Fully customize each game by creating your own settings so that no two games are the same."\n--unless you play more than 2 games (or maybe I broke my settings, as I've mentioned)\n\n"Use resources acquired from planets to build and strengthen your fleet"\n-- A single resource, that is the only currency and comes from every planet equally, there is no benefit or strategy to the planets you take - assuming you have time to terraform. (small map multiplayer would surely change that)\n\n"Construct ships that range from small, agile scouts to colossal battle cruisers"\n-- all of which are available from the start, so you wont... and scout what? With fog on enemy count was viewable, at least for neutrals there wasn't enough AI enemy when I got there 2 hours later to pay attention.\n\n"From improved mining to solar eruptions to labour strikes and beyond, implement cards and/or artifacts to make games more interesting with the element of chance"\n-- never once did I see a card worth the risk of using, I converted all to resources and I didn't need the extra resources\n\n\nSome of my opinions may be due to the fact that I only played 1 full game with one faction. Maybe I picked the wrong one, maybe I ruined the game with bad setting (not that I felt there were many options). Still the bugs and click-fest UI were bad enough for me to not load another map. So I do not recommend this game.\n\nTLDR; Its bad, just dont. It tries to be 4X but dummed down to 1X with some silly card game thrown in. I would happily perfect game Sins of a Solar Empire again, and I suggest you do that instead.","January 31","false","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grnt426/recommended/312960/","grnt426","grnt426","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grnt426/","314 products in account","Bugs:\n- Sometimes had trouble moving ships.\n- Sometimes terraformers didn't work.\n- When trying to trash a card for resources, sometimes it would select your artifacts instead.\n- Achievements didn't trigger correctly: eg, it gave me the "horde 50 resources" achievement when I had 10, but probably triggered after *earning* 50 resources total.  Either a typo in the achievement or a bug.\n- The end game stats were wrong. Claiming no ships were destroyed or lost (maybe because animations were off?)\n\nNegative Areas:\n- The game took some experimenting to figure out the mechanics, but there isn't much to figure out.\n- No resource management: All your planets generate exactly one resource that goes into a global pool\n- Battle mechanics are really unclear. It *feels* like risk, where more attack power gives higher dice roll chances. This means weaker armies can win battles.\n- Everything about the game felt like it was designed for mobile, which is only bad because I have a huge screen and it doesn't take advantage of the full range of inputs (keyboard, mouse) available.\n- None of the cards seemed worthwhile. Most had random effects, but according to users on the Steam forums some of them can target your own empire, which makes them difficult (actually impossible) to use effectively for strategy.\n- Most cards obtained were just "use for a single resource", but required three clicks to convert.\n- Not clear when terraformers would work.\n- The battle animations were dry, and I decided to turn them off in the second game, which effectively turned the game into checkers.\n- It wasn't clear which ships were moving, or if a ship needed orders to move.\n- The only way to see which ships are on a planet is to cycle through each one.\n\nAnd the biggest complaint\n- NO fleet management.  When a planet has 10 ships on it, you need individually select each one and move it. The biggest help is that after choosing to move the first ship, the next ship is already selected for you.\n\nSome features that would make it interesting:\n- Any kind of planet management or customization.  Planets can only produce one of any ship in the game. They also can either be terraformed to boost resources (once), or never.\n- Any kind of tech tree. All ships are buildable from the start. All planets are colonizable from the start.\n- Meaningful race differentiation, right now they are too similar.\n- Planets that matter. Currently all planets are the same, no difference between them.\n- Better cards that can be used more specifically. Less "convert card to one resource" cards.\n\nThis game really feels like early access, or some kind of beta.  It needs more features to be a worthwhile game, espscially at a $15 price point. The AI isn't challenging, and the game is incredibly flat.  I have seen tactical games with less features but they were considered more deeply for their impact on the overall design and led to a highly focused but "chess" like feeling.  This game feels like checkers.  Just move your slightly larger groups of units around one at a time until the enemy is eliminated. It isn't deep and it doesn't feel "tactical", just rote movements until "victory".","September 9, 2014","false","0.9"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","7","21","0","1"

For me, yeah, it's fun. It's incredibly simple, but some more explination as to how some gameplay mechanics work would have been nice. For example, I don't really know how terraforming works, but I haven't needed it. I also don't know what one of the interface buttons next to owned planets do, but it's a nuke symbol so I'm guessing it does something I don't want to do to my planet. Guessing, because the short digital manual says nothing of it.\n\nThe game is very simple to pick up, and play, but requires some strategy, and forethought to not muck things up. The way every strategy game should be, in my opinon.

After playing for awhile it's a twist on the board game Risk. Not a lot of depth without the artifact cards. Was worth $2 to me. But not all would enjoy it. I probably will not play much more :P","January 4","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

THe map is always the same grid. All you do build ships and move them around on the map. Whenever you move a ship to a planet, you automatically get that planet. Don't see the point of building expensive ships, just lots of little ships since they take only one turn. Starting location also determines whether you lose or win the game.\n\nThe UI is poor. You do have a planet construction menu, but it only shows the planets and not what it's building if anything, and after you select a planet, you have to go back into the menu again for another planet and so on. So if you have 50 planets good luck! Also you can only build one ship per planet.\n\nThere is no way to adjust the panning speed, I found this to be extremely annoying, only real good way is to zoom out and hope for the best. The game also has a default zoom, So if you're zoomed out and you click on a planet, if automatically goe to it's default zoom level (quite annoying).\n\nI had fog of war on, but I could still see everything my enemies saw. WTF! Only thing FOW did was not show the neutral planets beyond which ones I had explored. Even with FOW you can see if your enemies are building anything at a certain planet and how long it'll take, so why even have this option in the first place if it really doesn't do anything.\n\nBuilding ships is fairly straight forward, each planets give 0-2 resources and that's how much you have to build with each turn collectively. Otherwise you don't get to build anything on the planets, just ships all the time. You can terraform planets, while the graphic doesn't change, only terraforms how much mineral you get up to 2. The hive is at a sever disadvantage since they can't terraform anything (no option to build terraforming ships). When looking at your list of ships, it doesn't say if your terraforms are actually terraforming or not.\n\nIt's also hard to tell who has what planet since each race only has one color, so if you're fighting your own race, you can't tell which planets are yours. Also there are 4 races with four leaders each, however, there are no differences between the leaders of each perspective race, they're all the same, only difference is appearance.\n\nThe description for this game is BS!...across tens to hundreds of planets.. Max planets is 98. No tutorial at all, I ended up playing against myself just to learn the game.\n\n...game that delivers a deeply tactical and highly visual experience... More BS! Deeply Tactical? How? The only tactical I saw was deciding where to move ships to. Battles? They're automated, only based on attack & defense. All ships are predesigned. I found that I could only move one ship at a time instead of a fleet. So if you have five ships on a planets, you have to give orders to each ship one at a time. And you can only move one planet at a time, no long distance orders. At one point I had over a hundred ships to move and each one requires a minumum of two clicks, one to select, one to confirm.\n\nCard, ship, and planets menus are all wrap around (unchangeble), This make the menus completely useless for this type of game, because you have to remember which ship was first. Also the menu stays at the same place where the last player (human opponent) was selecting their build.\n\nYou can't disable the constant annoying pop-ups for this game. You can't skip the battles either, you have to watch every single one. The game does have some bugs, the two I found where sometimes you can't terraform a planet or move a ship, and then next turn you can, maybe. The game will also sometimes zoon to a different place then where you want to go. Or it won't let you select the planet you want.\n\nFound out the last player has the biggest advantage, since you get to see where the previous players are attacking and what cards they're using.\n\nI never completed the single player game, was just way too much clicking to move all the ships .","January 20","false","6.1"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
