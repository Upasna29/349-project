Cabela in general tends to come out w/ 2 types of games- Realistic hunting simulators and arcade call of duty like shooting hunting games. I enjoy both but others who only prefer one need to make sure they're only getting the right one. Cabela's Hunting Expeditions and Cabela's Big Game Pro Hunts are the realistic ones for people that want to go that route. Games like Cabela's African Adventures and Cabela's Dangerous Hunts are more arcade shoot em up style like COD and don't follow the realism or rules of conventional hunting, they're just mainly action packed shooting games. If you want a fun fast paced shooting game get African adventures, if you want a more realistic shooting game get Hunting expeditions and/or pro hunts. You'll have fun with this game if you're expecting the right thing.","December 29, 2014","true","14.5"," 56 of 61 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","56","61","0","0"

I used to think these games were all about hunting in first person view, but they're actually played in third person. At least I was right about the hunting aspect.\n\nThe game is split up into big, open areas. You can collect treasures, explore the world, do sidequests and, later on, hunt for the bigger enemies (which act as some sort of boss fight). There are 5 or 6 worls, with different environments and the hunting aspect is in fact kinda fun to do. No, it's not brilliant or anything, but entertaining. But by the time you reach world 3 or 4 you've probably seen it all. That's where I grew tired of the game. I'm sure most of you will, too. But I had a good time with it. It's a good pastime.\n\nOne more thing; the menus are a ♥♥♥♥♥ to navigate so I had actually overwritten my savegame when I was 2 hours into the game. Had to start all over again... The fact that you can't select a resolution above 1920x1080 was also a bit of a letdown.\n\n[Rating: 72/100]","November 21, 2013","true","3.8"," 75 of 95 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","75","95","0","0"

Once you finish the game, in story mode, there isn’t much you can do here other than roaming around the areas hunting normal game animals or repeating the story.\nBesides the story mode, this time, they also present a “Shooting Galleries” mode where you can walk along some tracks and shoot animals like an arcade game, which offers a bit more fun (and game time) to the game.\n\nThe game story is revealed with some nice animations resembling a comic book. Here, you get to be a big hunter called Mason going on a African safari, from the savannah to the desert and jungle.\nMason is payed to try to find the pieces of a lost tribal statue meanwhile hunting the dangerous animals, and in the course of the story it will also get a bit romantic.\n\nAs for the game, it has decent graphics (not too real, not too dummy-like) and a fair enough of everything, from weapons to animals, areas and missions. As you play along, you can upgrade the weapons by finding hidden objects (fossils) and besides the story missions you also have some free hunts you can do to earn XP and unlock hunting abilities.\nAfter some time playing, you will start to feel that the missions resemble one each other, being to stalk or survive or shooting/boss fight, but they will have you entertained and busy while playing them.\nAs for the animals, they don’t have that much dynamic. Not that they have fixed paths or behavior but after some time they also feel kinda repetitive and other times they even will get stuck in the environment. But like I said before, it’s fair enough.\n\nThe price, as all cabela’s games, is a bit high (imo) mainly because they are always kinda one use games – when you finish them, there isn’t much to (re)play them again…\n\nOverall, I had a great time playing this game and if you get it on Steam it also includes 33 achievements that you can try to hunt down.\n\nCheck my game play and maps at http://hucorner.imbl.net","December 29, 2013","true","27.8"," 38 of 47 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","38","47","0","0"

Well not for hardcore hunters anyways. This is simply an open world third person shooter with minimalistic feature. If you think of it this way then it should be fine. Everything in this game like graphics, story, gameplay, sound, voice acting and content is mediocre at best.\n\nYou play a role of a hunter equipped with a rifle, a shotgun, some ammo packs and med kit in an open area with several hunting events to trigger, collectible items to find and spots to view. Occasionally you will encounter some wild animals to kill. You get to travel in the may by foot or a jeep. Collectible items sometimes gives you upgrade or new weapons. Completing quests will gain you experience to level your character. Levelling will give you a single point to add to sets of skill trees where you can equipt 3 of them at a time. Basically that is all you get to do in a map. Completing hunting events will bring you to the next area. Repeat this a few times and you are done.\n\nHunting animals are rather repetitive where you either go in guns blazing while dodging them or sneak up on them through tall grass. Killing an animal will trigger slo-mo event which gives you x-ray view of the critical spot of the animal for a few seconds.\n\nAnd that's about it, all the game has got to offer. Overall it is not bad but don't expect much logic from it. This game is meant for casual gamers and running on x64 Windows 10 didn't give me any issues at all.","March 23","true","1.5"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","31","37","0","0"

I was hoping it meant that a couple of my friends and I could roam around hunting for animals and maybe leveling up our characters. Honestly this game isn't worth the $10 I paid for it. It's just so unrealilistic. Since when is it possible to roll right next to an animal and not spook it. If you are going to make a hunting game at least make it like actual hunting not some tom clancy splinter cell game. When you go on a hunt it's all staged fighting you don't actual hunt the animal. In order to get attachments for your weapon you have to find fossils, but the fossils aren't even there it's just a flashing light. It's just a piece of crap if you ask me, and I know why it was on sale... If you are looking for a hunting game I don't recommend this game.","May 2, 2014","false","1.6"," 49 of 73 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","49","73","2","1"

Most missions were either combat or stealth missions, where you either shot everything trying to kill you, or you sneak through a herd of animals to bag 1 special trophy.\n\nI sort of felt bad playing this though, as unlike Cabela's Hunting Expeditions, where there was usually a limt of 2 on whatever you were hunting, in this game, just about everything can be killed (with the exception of birds) with no limits, with many of those animals likely being on endangered lists.\n\nThe final total was something like 200+ hyenas, 100+ deer of various kinds, 20+ lions, 10+ elephants, 10+ rhinos, etc etc etc.\n\nThere was also a gallery mode which was also fun, which is basically a rail shooter where you try to rack up as many combos get as high a score as possible.\n\nFun? Definitely. Ethical....Proooobably not.","May 26, 2014","true","21.9"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","14","18","4","0"

Game play is absolute garbage. Animals all move in groups (Leopard? In a pack? Really???) and all know where you are from the start. Basically, it feels rather like Doom, but with animals. Other games make more fun and realistic hunting scenarios as mini-games. I was expecting a lot more from a game that's supposed to be focused purely on hunting.
