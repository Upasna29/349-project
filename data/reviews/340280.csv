It is challenging(If you're not some smart-♥♥♥ dude with an IQ of 150+) and wants you to think different, like those Riddles where you have to think either the way a kid does, or think around corners.(it's technically the same...)\nThe Soundtrack somehow works fine with the game, even though it seems a bit repetitive to me(and you just have to mute it after a time), but it won't stop you from thinking. The graphics seem well-made(you don't need better graphics for this kind of game) and it certainly looks simple but nice. Somehow futuristic.\n\nSo i found no bugs(yet) and can say, that it has a unique style of playing(to me), is challenging and looks+sounds fine. I would recommend it, especially for this price!\n\n\n\nPS: It seems to have an active and nice developer, just look at the Community-Hub(He is very active now, not like those from the BIG COMPANIES). He/She(Who knows?) seems to also wants to implement the ideas from the community.

The difficulty comes from the fact that there are multiple levels (extending the game into three dimensions) to deal with, and all cubes move simulaneously; when a cube is moved left, every cube will move to the left. This leads to very interesting and unique gameplay, and as the levels progress, the game grows increasingly challenging. For the perfectionist, at the end of each level, the perfect score for that level is revealed, and you can then retry the level to lower your score the one or two (or five or ten) moves. However, completing the game and earning the achievements do not require this, making the game fun for serious and casual gamers.\n\nThe only downside I found to the game is that the sound played when you hover over a button, something required in-between every level, is harsh and out of place with the music. This meant that after about ten levels I muted the sounds, but this fixed the problem, and the ambient sound now fit the game excellently.\n\nI highly recommend this game for the puzzles it provides, and doubly because of the cheap price.","January 8, 2015","true","2.9"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","25","30","6","0"

You eventually have to track many things at once that behave in different ways, while figuring out how to make them work together.\n\nIts not perfect. New concepts and block behaviors are shown with an animation before the levels in which they first appear, but these animations/descriptions are not particularly clear. It doesn't matter, though, because the first few groups of levels are exceptionally easy - in general, the game progresses a little too slow at the beginning. Its not 'that' hard to figure out the basics! And new mechanics are easier and easier to fit in, since you already have a handle on the previous ones.\n\nIt has a very pretty aesthetic, but the usability and controls don't live up to it. There doesn't seem to be an ideal setup - controller makes most sense for the core gameplay, but the menus are so slow with a controller that I stick with mouse/keyboard - however, mouse controls are awkward. Keyboard is fine, but I gotta be careful not to left click!\n\nThe biggest issue by far is lack of any kind of 'undo'. When you've got a level that takes 20+ moves at minimum, and you're going for that minimum score, you don't want to make a mistake 20 moves in! I'm stuck on one level for this exact reason, and its SO FRUSTRATING having to play the first 17/18 odd moves EVERY FREAKING TIME! Even a quicker way to reset the level would be welcome.\n\nAll that said, its worth playing and the price is more than fair.","January 16, 2015","true","10.3"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

Innercube has six  different colored sided cubes, but Cubot cubes are just one colored. Well but let's now discuss Cubot.\n\nCubots is the currency you can earn in this game after completing each level. You can buy solutions for that (it starts with 8 cubots) but who seriously does? There's apparently no other purpose of Cubots. Like in Hexcells where you need the points to unlock next levels. In Cubot every level is automatically unlocked after beating stage 6 - evertyime. Each level has 8 stages a 10 levels that makes 80 levels altogether - That's OK.\n\nThe levels can be distinguished by new cube types (different colors: red does double steps, green has reversed movement, and so on ... ) or new puzzle elements (like colorchangers, portals, elevators or stoppers).\nThe aim is to bring all cubes to the same colored fields in the end. Very positive is that the level design has different layers where you also can fall down from a higher level. I also liked much the level select menu with a miniature picture of the whole map. They even lately added a level editor.\n\nNow comes the moan. This game makes fun for sure. But it's not as high as expected. It seems sterile that after every solved stage 7 you'll get as reward a hardcoded wise quote of Erno Rubik, Eric Schmidt or Albert Einstein. It isn't random and/or surprising. Also the puzzle elements are well mixedup in higher levels, but there's no higher value to progress at all.\nI missed some basic game elements like the "undo" button which I'm used to. Some menus do not respond on the first click. It also seems after once changing the camera view or use the mouse roll gesture the WASD controls get temporarly deactivated. That's annoying because these are just little fixable bugs. But my first impression got spoiled due to that.\n\nCubot is not a bad game. I wouldn't say that and I recommend it. But sometimes you have to bite your teeth together to playthrough a certainly well meant great game with little nerving mistakes.","June 23, 2015","true","4.0"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rikame/recommended/340280/","rikame","rikame","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rikame/","818 products in account","Cubot takes great pride in its minimalist presentation. A cynic may suspect that this “minimalism” is a carelessly-crafted excuse for a lazy or empty game. Such skepticism could not be more misplaced.\n\nCubot is puzzle-solving game comparable to sliding puzzles, or perhaps to Rush Hour. Cubot adds to these games what could only be feasible in a three- dimensional game: three dimensions. The objective of the game is to land each block—puzzles quickly include more than one block, onto its respective target location. Each action, however, moves all blocks in accordance with the game’s rules as well as with each block’s own distinctive properties. There are, as far as I can tell, ten different kinds of blocks. One moves one space per turn, another moves two. One presents or removes obstacles, another moves in the opposite direction of all other blocks. There are 80 levels and, while this isn’t the most difficult game ever presented, it is satisfying to solve (particularly in the fewest number of turns possible).\n\nOn top of these mechanics, the game manages to have a personality despite its minimalist form. The music is calm and the UI is very clean. The developers even threw in some famous quotes, and they’re about—you guessed it—solving puzzles. For the low starting price of $2 and the presumption that it will get even cheaper, this game is certainly worth it if you like puzzles (I’m enjoying this game the same way that I enjoy the Portal games, even without the witty dialogue) or if you’re looking for a game that isn’t too difficult to 100%. I am enjoying this game and I am glad to see it on Steam.\n\nUpdate: I 100%'d the game. Game is hard.","January 8, 2015","true","7.6"," 26 of 40 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","26","40","2","0"

The game is also colourful, even if it uses around 5 colours (black, white, red, blue, green), they are used well and simply to differentiate the cubes.\n\n+ Gameplay is frustrating at a good level, it really teaches us how annoying the human brain can, you will play a level so hard but when you finally look past the complications and realise how simple it is, you have a laugh and possibly call yourself an idiot, then experience the same thing the next level. Although the game is really short and easy controls as if it were a mobile game, so I wouldn’t be surprised if this indie game was ported to mobile devices like  Super Hexagon . The fact it allows the use of Xbox 360 Controllers and PS3 Controllers, allows for more consoles to play it, so it could possibly find itself on the Xbox Store or the PSN.\n\n+ The controls are extremely simple, the arrow keys to change angle, and the WASD keys to move the keys, that is absolutely it. Nothing else is needed to play the game. So Cubot continues to keep it simple.\n\n+ The length of the game is short, that is not bad but some people who love puzzles love lots of puzzles, so since this game looks young, they could possibly introduce a Steam Workshop for the community to create puzzles as well, or give a weekly puzzle, so the game can last longer than just play, finish and leave it in storage forever.\n\n+ Simplicity is the strongest feature of the game, it is focused sorely on making the game so simple to the level where it looks complex, but it isn’t. That is what makes the game so great. We love challenges but they give us something so easy its challenging.\n\nOverallTruthfully, I was scrolling through the Store page, just looking around and I find this $2 game on steam, the pictures and description looked intriguing and I enjoy puzzle games, so I figures why not. And it is one hell of a good way to spend two dollars I'll give ya that.\n\nCubot achieved a level of simplicity whereas it is very complex. The beginning levels of the game is simple but gradually they make it seem harder, but once you see past the complexity and use simplicity, the game will seem so much easier and you will feel like an idiot. They repeatedly shove in your face that this is simple, so treat it simply. But the human brain isn't hardwired to look at things simply, it is hardwired to over complicate things and look too deeply into something when the answer is literally in your face.\n\nI recommend this game if you like having a more than decent puzzle game at a very affordable and cheap price.","January 8, 2015","true","3.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","12","15","3","0"

The controls consist of (if using the WASD/Mouse) using the WASD to move the cubes Up/Down/Left/Right and using the mouse to move the angle of the camera so you can see the puzzle from different angles. The cubes move square by square and that is pretty much it.\n\nSimple Gameplay:\nThe objective of each level is to get the colored cubes to the matching colored tile at the same time.\nThe game introduces the player to different mechanics in the puzzle as the player progresses through each level. Using WASD keys (or whatever control scheme you desire), players move the cubes one tile by one tile, two tile by two tile, etc. (depending on the color of the cube). However the puzzles get harder as the player realizes that cubes of the same color both move simultaneously with each press and introduce more things such as buttons.\n\nSimple Graphics:\nCubot offers a very clean and simple visuals. As the screenshots show, it's cubes with various colors and white tiles with colors painted into some of them.\n\n* Audio Simplicity:\nAfter spending a tiny bit more time on the game, I personally thought that the audio was extremely soothing and compliments the pace and style of Cubot. Although if you are very conscious of the audio, it may become too repetitive or get annoying. Cubot's soundtrack is very, as stated before, soothing and quite atmospheric, somewhat similar to Antichamber for those who have played it. However, some sounds are generated from, for example, hovering the mouse over a menu button (as some reviews have stated) may be "out of place," it's just like Antichamber when you pick up a cube or interact with an object, nothing too awkward.\n\n9/10 Simply Complex.\n\n* Edited (1/12/2015)","January 8, 2015","true","1.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","0"

It is a combination puzzle game where you have to do the right set of moves to get the coloured blocks onto the colored tiles.

There's no undo button and levels are all sequence-based so plenty of levels end up allowing you to easily be stuck and having to redo the entire puzzle to get back to where you were, which is annoying especially on the later, more challenging levels. There's no way to directly control a specific cube, either, which gets annoying with the mirrored-movement cubes. For the price the content level is fine and the puzzles aren't really that badly designed, but by the end I got tired of playing due to the forced repetition. Still, worth checking out, it's alright and it's really cheap, so.","April 4, 2015","true","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It was fun, enjoyable, relaxing, that is until it kicked you in the face with the green part and was more frustrating than anything.\n\nThat's not to say there isn't a person that would love this game. Anybody that derives an enjoyment from hard puzzles should absolutely love this game. But I'll have to say, if you're interested because you just want to unwind on something simple and fun, you'll only enjoy the first ~20 minutes worth of this game. After that, it stops becoming relaxing and more mentally intensive.\n\nIf, in the future, they release another version of this game with just blue and maybe red sections of this game expanded upon further without throwing in the green and beyond, that is something that I would completely recommend.\n\nFor now, though, I'm torn on a recommendation. I can't simply say yes, and I can't simply say no. It's a game for a type of person. If you are that puzzley, determined person, then this is completely for you.

You have to escape to the menu to reset\n- The UI feels somewhat clunky; the transitions / animations feel a little slow and not smooth.
