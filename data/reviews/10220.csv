"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfemaledog/recommended/10220/","thatfemaledog","Det. Dicksmack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfemaledog/","654 products in account","This game is a mess... and let me count the ways.\n\n1. A broken melee system: Postal, true to the franchise, offers many different tools of the trade to dispose of your enemies. And some of the tools include a sledgehammer, machete, fire axe, and something else I can't remember. But none of that matters because the only one that works is the ♥♥♥♥ing machete. It is extremely difficult to land your blow on enemies with other weapons, including your kick, but it doesn't matter because the fire axe and sledgehammer don't even do any damage.\n\n2. Abysmal Gunplay: Would you be surprised if I told you this is the strongest gameplay element? Cuz it is. Is it because it's fun? No. Is it because there's cool weapons? No. It's because guns are pretty much the only gameplay element that functions. A headshot kills any enemy instantly. So, if you don't want to deal with the awfulness of every other tool of the trade, guns are the way to go. And don't bother with the shotgun or the MG. They're both garbage.\n\n3. Awful Humor: Postal 2 got it's humor from satirizing both social issues and video game tropes and controversies. Postal 3 doesn't do this at all. Instead, it goes for stupid humor and shock value. Like terrorists dressing up in giant novelty moustaches and sombreros and sneaking across the US Border. Or firing man juice soaked tissue clumps at Sarah Palin in a porn shop full of men jerking it to monitors. And I'll admit, I laughed a few times, but it wasn't because I thought it was clever. Quite the opposite, in fact. I laughed because it was so utterly stupid and random that it just brought out the inner caveman. And that's the problem; Postal 3 is offensive for all the wrong reasons. There are a few times when the developers want to get tongue and cheeky with you. But it's hard to find it funny when the game keeps kicking your ♥♥♥ every chance it gets. Sorry Postal 3, but you can't kick me in the nads and then give me a piece of cake. It doesn't work that way.\n\n4. What-The-♥♥♥♥ Scale Performance: Do you have a decent gaming rig? Do you have an ultra powerful rig? Well neither matter because Postal 3 is terribly built and optimized. I can run mostly anything on max settings, and yet this game chugs when things get going. And even setting it to low didn't change the performance one bit. It's amazing how you can mess up so bad on an engine designed specifically for non-high end machines.\n\n5. It's Linear & Catharsis Sucks: The entire game has you follow a very narrow path of the dude going about his day just trying to earn some money. And, as you continue, you get to make moral choices that alter which missions you do. This would be fine, if it wasn't Postal. Or, you know, at least done properly. I wanna be free to explore the city and do what I want and attack the story at my own pace. When you beat the game, you unlock the entire city to go around and play in. But when you start it you see just how bad the direction really is. They basically took what they made of the city, and then stitched together the other set pieces from missions into the mix. There's no sense of where you're going at all. It's apparent they did not design a city and split it accordingly. They just made random crap, stitched it together with duct tape, and said, "Here this is Catharsis." You know it's bad when you walk up to a highway offramp and end up at the gay rodeo. Oh, yeah, there's a gay rodeo too. If you were expecting more there isn't. That's pretty much the joke. Gay cowboys. Harr harr.\n\n6. Gimmicky Weapons and Assets: Postal 3 showed off a teaser many years ago featuring the Postal dude driving around the city in a segway. They showed this more in the grindhouse trailer they showed at one of the E3 conventions. Guess what? That segway they hyped so much? It's only used in one mission. Yup. One ♥♥♥♥ing mission. Besides the stupid segway, there's other weapons apart from your normal guns and melee weapons you can use to have "fun." There's grenades, the gasoline tank, feral cats with super AIDS (???), etc. And all of these suffer from abysmal controls. Thrown weapons like grenades and cats involve holding down one of the mouse buttons, and then pressing the other mouse button while still holding on to the primary fire button. Or something like that. I don't know and I don't care enough to find out. It's that bad that even after 10 hours of this crap I still couldn't get the hang of throwing ♥♥♥♥. Oh, and the gas tank? Useless. Why? Because it's hard as ♥♥♥♥ to pour the gas out over where you want it specifically and it's even harder to throw your ♥♥♥♥ing match on the gasoline you poured out.\n\n7. Loading Screens: This game has some of the worst loading screens I've ever seen. Not only are they insanely frequent, but they take forever too. There's a loading screen to start the intro videos. Then there's another loading screen after that to load the menu. The first launch of a map or first time loading takes 1 minute and 40 seconds (Yes, I timed it) to load. After that, any other loading screens take between 35-40 seconds.\n\n8. The Moral System: I don't mind if a game has a moral system. What I do mind, however, is when you introduce me to the moral system mechanic, teach me what it does and whatever, and then tell me at the end of the game that it doesn't matter. They try to make it a joke towards endgame with Krotchy (who gave you the tutorial in the first place) telling you it doesn't mean anything. And then at the last level they tell you it actually didn't mean anything. So if you thought you were going to get a different ending mission, or ending cutscene, based on your actions then guess what; you don't. This isn't ♥♥♥♥ing funny, Akella. That is a huge slap in the face to your ♥♥♥♥ing player base. Especially when the moral system was one of the features you boasted about in your trailers and even on this very store page.\n\nIn short: ♥♥♥♥ this game. ♥♥♥♥ Akella for making it. And ♥♥♥♥ RWS for not making themselves and leaving it in the hands of incompetent jagoffs.","December 23, 2013","false","10.8"," 299 of 352 people (85%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","85","299","352","9","20"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/THPPFT/recommended/10220/","THPPFT","JakkelR4psc4llion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/THPPFT/","82 products in account","Okay, after finally playing the first and second Postal games, I finally decided to give the third installment another shot. Even after learning the backstory of the game (RWS Inc. hired an underfunded and tyrannical game developer company from Russia to code the game), I decided to give it a second chance. Sure, I wouldn't get all the extra little achievements like I did with the first two Postals, but I'd at least beat the game and give it a fair judgment from that, right?\n\nWrong. I had completely forgotten what it was that had kept me from playing this game in the first place. It wasn't the linear levels (Postal 1 had linear levels). It wasn't the stupid jokes or the weird weapons and minigames (Postal 2 had stupid jokes and weird weapons and minigames). It was the gameplay. Yes, Akeela Software (or whatever they call themselves) had suffered through a Russian economic crash and in suffering fired their competent, cooperative developers and assigned this project to a group of Prima Donnas who not only couldn't correctly string a game together even if it was coming out of their own ♥♥♥, but also deliberately altered the structure of the game against the wishes of RWS Inc. (you know, the people who wrote the game series and own the rights to them and CONTRACTED Akeela TO DO MAKE THE GAME THAT RWS had envisioned!!!). Not only that, but Akeela also refused to release the code to the general public because they didn't want those loyal gamers to make MODs or anything, even though RWS Inc. wanted them to. As a result, the gameplay is sticky, jagged, the graphics go photo-negative after 15 minutes of gameplay and glitches flood this game. For example, I had to restart a level because the game wouldn't let me open a door that was integral to the plot, and the escort mission with the segways was almost impossible. All in all, it kept me from enjoying this game not once but twice, which is a shame, because otherwise, I thought it could have been an enjoyable game.\n\n*SPOILER ALERT* For those still interested in knowing, the game pickups where the second one left off: after detonating Paradise, Arizona with a nuke, the Postal dude drove to the next closest fictional town in Arizona, Catharsis. There, a wealthy Ron Jeremy owns and runs everything with a pretty open mind. The problem is that he's constantly being undermined or even flat out attacked by Eco-terrorists, Al Queda, God-fearing hockey moms (led by Sarah Palin...wait...why is she in Arizona?!) and other satirical and colorful characters. The Postal Dude, just trying to make a buck, is given constant choices as to whose side he is on, or at least which side he wants to flip flop to and from. While the levels are linear, your actions do choose the course of the game.   Unlike the last game, the third Postal gives you a Max Payne type of third person layout and aiming system, and you get most of the weapons from the previous game, plus a few new ones like beehives, a shopvac (filled with questionably stained tissues) and the badgersaw.\n\nLike I said, it could have an enjoyable installment to the series, but the Russian contractors completely ruined it to the point that RWS Inc. even tells people to stay away from it.","July 1, 2014","false","8.4"," 230 of 274 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","230","274","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/10220/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","Postal 2 won't go down in history as one of the greatest games of all time. It probably won't even make the average top 500 list. That said, I thought it was very entertaining. When it comes to Postal III, I'm at a loss for words. I'd prefer to write a positive review, describing in detail on how this game improved on its predecessor. If necessary, I could write a negative review, filled to the brim with reasons as to why I believe this product to be a disappointing sequel. Instead, I'm staring into the abyss.\n\nThe Postal Dude is at it again. After blazing a trail of death and destruction through the town of Paradise, he finds himself in Catharsis. Madcap mayhem and wacky hijinks await as Postal Dude tries to find a paying job. Will you somehow find the light of virtue within yourself? Or will you once again submit to your demons, using murder to solve every minor dilemna? Whatever the case, you're sure to be in for a great time. This game also stars Ron Jeremy and Jennifer Walcott. I'm surprised that Lloyd Kaufman didn't make an appearance as well.\n\nThis entry uses a morality system. Unfortunately, this doesn't mean The Postal Dude will be helping old ladies cross the street (or into woodchippers). Basically, if you want to be the good guy, you have to abide by the law. Naturally, this requires that you become a police officer, and make the law your own. While this doesn't give you a free pass to endanger innocent lives, at least you're doing your part to make Catharsis a safer(?) place. If that sounds like too much trouble, you can always be evil incarnate. This will result in different levels, and eventually a bad ending, if you don't change your ways. If eternal damnation doesn't appeal to you, there's always the handy taser gun. Non-lethal takedowns slowly add up, allowing you another opportunity to join the force when you complete the level. Unfortunately, the possibility exists that your morality, will be at the mercy of the game itself.\n\nWhile I applaud the writers for their attempt at injecting more story into the Postal saga, things stop making sense very early on. I suppose this can be attributed to the fact that I had to skip stages in order to progress. Let me rephrase that: I had to cheat* just to complete this game. Aside from the high probability of crashes, there are numerous scripting issues. Some doors are scripted to open when an event occurs. For reasons that can surely be attributed to the troubled development of the game, these scripts frequently break.\n\nTo give an example: Shortly after I joined the force, I was tasked with eliminating the homeless that were running rampant through the police station. Eventually I reached a point where a door was supposed to open, but it didn't. I could see the enemy's guns clipping through the door, but there was nothing I could do about it. I restarted the level, which fixed it. However, there was another door later on in the level, and it had the exact same issue. This happened again in another level, where I was supposed to go to the mall, the doors simply wouldn't open.\n\nUnlocking all of the stages in Postal III via cheats is a simple task, but that isn't the point. All that work I did trying to be a good Postal Dude? Gone. Putting difficulty aside, when a game can't be completed without resorting to cheats, that means it is broken.\n\nPostal III tends to feel like busy-work. Most of the levels start off with an extremely boring job, which fits in with the story. After a short time, things get crazy when Soccer Moms or Savage Nerds or Eco-Terrorists or ???? show up. This is the point where you have to kill/subdue a certain number of them so that the level will end. Postal 2's strength wasn't in standard FPS mechanics. A lot of the entertainment came from using the sandbox aspects. It was a game designed around finding different solutions for everyday problems (sometimes without murder). With Postal III, almost the entirety of the product involves shooting, and it is very poorly-handled. The Postal Dude can take cover, but it's so ineffective you're sometimes better off standing out in the open. On the bright side, the enemy AI is so bad they're liable to ignore or even forget about you in the heat of combat. The levels that don't require the player to deal with x amount of enemies, tend to be really linear slogs. There are even escort missions, as if players wouldn't have enough reasons to hate this game.\n\nAside from severe technical faults such as long load times and poor performance, Postal III also suffers from awful mechanics. Melee is basically useless. Even the heavier weapons, like the fire ax, don't work all that well. One of the items you acquire is a laser pointer, for leading Champ (your dog) to enemies. It is complete trash. The same can be said about most of Postal III's weapons. There's no real incentive to play with them, because they either don't work, or just aren't satisfying. Typically, the average Postal III play-through is going to revolve entirely around shooting everything. It gets old very quickly. Urinating is no longer infinite either. The Postal Dude can't ♥♥♥♥ as much as he wants, now he has to wait for his bladder to refill. Yes, it's probably an unnecessary thing to complain about, but it's still a nonsensical change that adds nothing to the game. Everything about Postal III is worse than its prequel...Everything**.\n\nSome of you reading this review might not care about Postal. You might even think "It's a garbage franchise anyway. Who cares?" Well, it's just my opinion, but I liked the second game. It was crass, offensive, and sometimes the humor fell absolutely flat. Yet underneath all of the nastiness, there is still a game. Postal III is broken, and is more prone to cause headaches than provide any entertainment value. The multitude of bugs, scripting failures, and generally unfun game-design, make for a forgettable entry in this controversial series.\n\n*While I did cheat to complete a couple stages, I didn't actually try to skip any.\n**The soundtrack is pretty decent.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","August 4, 2015","false","9.6"," 200 of 253 people (79%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","79","200","253","21","4"

Well, the second one was charming in that somewhat difficult to explain way that not very good games sometimes are, and it was on sale for a tenner, what could I possibly lose?\nSometimes in the quiet hours of the night, when it seems not even God is there to hear me, I ask myself what I could have saved had I never clicked ‘Add to Cart’. It’s more than the ten dollars, what I lost that day transcends the mere balancing of a checkbook, when I played this game the concepts of love, of faith in my fellow man, the very knowledge of any pleasures I had once known all fled from me in an instant.\n\nI wish I could chalk my dislike of this game up to the awful controls, the movement clunkier than a 50’s movie robot or the aiming that I can only describe as ‘acrid’, like the breath of a drunken pirate manning the cannons of his schooner, the fearsome ‘Nobody Will Ever Love You’. I can’t though, much like an iceberg made of solid human feces it goes much deeper than the surface problems. I didn’t even come across anything that offensive in my two-hour waterboarding session with Postal 3, I know that’s exactly what it’s meant to do, and it succeeds with a lot of people, but it just fell flat. The limp and lifeless writing, which is exactly what it permanently rendered certain parts of my body, is the most grotesque thing here aside from the animations and cutscenes. All of this combines to form some sort of chimera of awful design that leaves an unpleasant taste in your mouth that has nothing to do with the attempted gross out humor involving vacuum cleaners and AIDS infected cats.\n\nIn the end, it all just tries so hard to elicit some kind of response, positive or negative, from the player, but much like God on the day this game was released, it simply left me feeling apathetic.","July 26, 2014","false","2.3"," 137 of 171 people (80%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","80","137","171","37","4"

This game, developed by Akella, NOT Running With Scissors - sees the Postal Dude rigth after a Nuclear Bomb goes off in the previous city, crosses a zombie infested bridge and is now forced to find a job in a new city, Catharsis, where a matter of chaotic events occur.\n\nThe game features a branching Storyline System ala Mass Effect's Paragon system, but more black and white with it's execution, it does make the game differ greatly with it's content and is a highly welcome addition imo - the rest of the game however... is terrible. It is a third person shooter that barely plays at all, it was built on Valve's Source Engine way back in the day, this game pretty much controls terribly and loosely,  has music falling out of loops, AI bugging out occasionally and much more that just scream unfinished.\n\nI should mention I do enjoy this game for what it is (a fan of the POSTAL franchise and the kind of macabre humor it uses) but from extremely buggy set pieces (Doors closing on you halting chapter progress.), horrible performance issues (Game is NOT enabled to properly run on Multi Core PCs and PhysX feature do a LOT more harm than good), spotty AI and just overall terrible loose mechanics, the game is most definately a skip to those whom are not willing to put up with the game;s shortcoming - those being dang near everything else - considering the game is buggy to the point of it being borderline unplayable.","July 17, 2013","false","8.6"," 100 of 131 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","100","131","0","1"

I personally enjoy this game, but I can see why others don't. Many people ask if it's really *that* bad, and if they should pass on it or not... I think you should TRY it, especially if you're a fan of the previous games. But don't fart around, try rushing through as much as you can - that way you can still qualify for a refund, which you may want.\n\nPros:\n+A good amount of weapons. Not as many as Postal 2, but more than most games.\n+Though generally very cheesy, it has plenty of comedic moments.\n+Goofy brand name refrences. A video game store with a game called Left 4 Bread, a coffee shop called Lotsofbucks or some ♥♥♥♥, etc.\n+Sticks to the usual Postal story. The Dude is broke, has troubles holding a job, and doesn't get his hard earned cash.\n+Ability to choose whether you're good or bad (or neutral). This changes both gameplay and story, and gives you different missions.\n+Pee simulator - part two?\n+Neat soundtrack. And it suites the game.\n+Boss fights are pretty solid, and can provide a challenge.\n+Tons of ♥♥♥♥ing blood and gibs, as well as vulgarity and some dark humor.\n+Tons of replayabiliy, as usual.\n+Fun gameplay, though for some people it may get boring.\n\nNeutral points (some might see as pros, while others see as cons):\nN) Not in first-person as POSTAL 2 was\nBut then again, let's not forget POSTAL 1 was a top-down shooter.\nN) Bizarre weapons, such as AIDS infested cats, a badger that acts as a chainsaw, and a vacuum that sucks up small items and shoots them out (non-leathal, and barely ethical to use).\nN) You have to unlock Free-roam by completing the game.\n\n\nCons:\n-Not made by RWS. Hell, they don't even make money from this game!\n-Bugs. Big bugs! We're talking tarantulas and genetically-altered cockroaches! You and other people will get stuck in certain spots, game crashes (I've rarely had this, though other people seem to have major issues with that), freezes from time to time, and many more. Some are smaller, and some... not so small.\n-Lag can be a ♥♥♥♥♥ at times, and the frame-rate can drop to -10 FPS.\n-Repetitive story. You start your job, you and/or your employer get attacked, you defend the area, the boss doesn't like that, you don't get paid, and on to the next one.\n-No trading cards.\n-Since it's developed by a Russian company, the English isn't very good. Poor grammar and what not.\n-No Rick Hunter, but the new Dude repeats gameplay phrases used in P2.\n-Physics are all over the place. Sometimes when you shot someone in the head with a pistol, their head will pop off. Other times you'll use a ♥♥♥♥ing machine gun, and they'll just drop dead with no gibs. If you tase somebody then pour gasoline on them, they occasionally set on fire. See what I mean? The physics aren't consistent.\n-Achievements are glitched. Which ones, you ask? Depends on how unlucky you are. I've heard some people have issues with certain achievements I don't have issues with, and vice versa. Sometimes an achievement is apparently locked, sometimes doing the necessary tasks won't add up. I've spent half hour lighting people on fire, killing dozens of people, but my achievement progress was only 4/50. No, I don't mean 4 out of the 50 remaining.","April 16","true","15.5"," 43 of 52 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","43","52","5","1"

I bought this game out of morbid curiousity, and now I regret it. Postal 3, or the Russian Postal, was a game developed by a Russian publisher called Akella, after they told Running With Scissors that they would fund and develop a third Postal game. Development was going good for the most part, until Russia was hit with a recession, forcing Akella to fire the A-Team, and get some less-experienced programmers who would work for cheaper. Akella had to change a lot from RWS's original plans to compensate for the new programmers lack of skill (like removing mulitplayer, switching the game to third-person, and switching from Unreal to Source (mainly due to budget, however)). What came from this development mess was a buggy-as-hell game that tried to be POSTAL 2, but failed miserably. Even if the incredible amount of bugs were patched, the game still falls flat due to boring level design. Almost every level is nothing but a kill-a-thon. Just kill X amount of enemies, and that's it. There's the occasional unique mission, like the Theigway level or the patrol missions, but there's just not enough variety. They also tried to implement a cover system, which fails dramatically when the enemies you're trying to take cover from just walk up behind you. One of the biggest issues of the game is that it's just not optimised. The game runs on the Source engine, but if I set all the video settings to max, the frame rate will go straight to ♥♥♥♥. Compare with Portal 2, released the same year, on the same engine. If I set everything to max, it'll run great. How did they manage to screw up something like that on the Source engine, easily the most optimised engine out there? The only really good things I can say about the game is that the graphics are pretty good (at least compared to POSTAL 2), and the soundtrack is absolutely eargasmic, but that's really it.\n\nAlso, if you're running Windows 8.1, don't even bother buying this game. The DRM won't let you play for some reason. RWS doesn't have the source code for the game, so they can't patch it out. There might be an unofficial patch, but you should probably look into that BEFORE buying this game.","December 28, 2013","false","10.0"," 42 of 52 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","42","52","2","0"

Oh, don't get me wrong, Postal 2 is better, but lll is a decent sequal. The branching paths for the story line is neatly implemented, since your actions determine the outcome, not just a prompt. Not hearing Rick Hunter as Postal Dude is pretty weird, but the new guy isn't a bad voice actor. Rick Hunter IS better, but the new voice is pretty decent. Gameplay works fine, though melee is pretty weak. The trademark humor is thankfully still there too. There are some sound issues, but it doesn't ruin the game or anything. The music is loud, but you can turn it down if you need to. Honestly, I urge people to give it a chance. It's not GOTY material, but it's a good time.\n\nRevision:\n\nPostal III, upon further reflection, is an awful game. Must of been denial that I payed twenty bucks for a mediocre game that blinded me. I've had a little bit of fun with it, but it is a terrible game. Hopefully Postal 4 ends up being awesome (and considering RWS will be the ones working on future Postal games, I'm pretty sure it will).","October 20, 2014","true","6.7"," 121 of 219 people (55%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","55","121","219","15","0"

Don't get me wrong, I loved the first two Postal games but this one is hands down one of the worst games I've ever played. It's Sonic '06 level bad people. Basically the game throws you into 3-4 minute load screens and that's not even the worst of it. Sure, you can run around and kill whoever and whatever you want, but the missions are all, and I mean every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ one, is a kill this many people or keep this many protesters at bay. There's nothing else to this game.\n\nStill want to play? Enjoy the worst voice acting I have ever seen and somehow, the graphics look worse than Postal II. The gameplay and weapons are all grotesque, and not in a good way. The "sick humor" is about as sick as my dying veteran, grandpa, bland and just lies there laughing to himself like a four year old that finds the word "booger" to be the funniest thing ever.

After all, Postal 2 was nothing like Postal 1.\n\nIt may take a while for you to get to the great Run N Gun action this game offers, but it's there.\nSome of the eralier missions can be boring, but if you know what to do they'll fly by.\nHell, there's even an in depth choices to give you branching quest lines. I'd suggest dodging between them to get the maximum gameplay value. Twenty dollars is a little pricey for something the devs don't support anymore, but if you're open minded it's worth a try.\n\nPretty original with it's wacky story, even if some of the humor falls flat. Such as over usage of the word ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the stupidest of ways. The duded may not be just like his old, asocial asexual self from the last game. but he's still pretty good. Now he's a white-trash meme loving dead beat with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ luck. He's deffinetly more layed back and not much of a psycho.\n\nThe game has great music, even if it does end up looping a couple times in each level, but it's mostly one song for each level so it's pretty good. Oddly serious and good music on the tutorial, fairly surprising and uneeded.\n\nThe game is crappy yet incredibly fun, and it know it. Almost has a saints row 3 feel, with how it doesn't take itself seriously. It has a lower-class outsider dark humor to it, which works in its favor. Honnestly, as a white-trash dead beat I find the postal dude relateable for the most part, with how he's scorned by everyone and's always an outsider.\n\nOver all, the game is a 7/10. Not a huge winner, but it's pretty dang original.\n\nAlso, I became god of the tabby-cats. By the end of the game, I had about thirty of them. This makes me very happy, considering I choose to save them all, hoping I could make them my army.","July 13, 2015","true","8.4"," 30 of 51 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","30","51","5","0"

It was also released way too early. Thanks to a Russian publisher which went for the money. I hope Akella is dead. RWS got pretty much ignored when this product was created. Also Akella and the devs left the product to die. Not even a proper source code has been released. This makes it nearly impossible to fix or mod the game. There are a few decent mods though. The game is so bad that many game functionalities are simply not working like melee weapon hit detection. To this comes bad performance and crashes. Story and gameplay wisely this product is a joke anyway. But I personally dont waste my time with this product and you shouldnt neither. Buy Paradise Lost instead. Or wait for Postal 3 Unreal. A Postal 3 remake in the unreal engine. Remade from scratch! Also there is Catharsis Reborn. Some sort of remake/sequel/alternative game in the Postal 3 Source engine. They might be able to create something good with it. Also we might be getting a proper patch once, but I doubt it. The game would still be bad for a Postal game, even if its fixed and bugfree.\n\nI waited so long for it, but it was just crap in the end. Sad story...\n\nMy Rating? None, I simply dont want to rate a broken alpha product. Not worth it.\nIf you really need to try this game, get it somewhere "free" or get a very very cheap key.\nSometimes RWS also gives some out for free, as demonstration how bad the game is.\nIm honest, I didnt finish the game. I guess some years ago I made it to the half with tons of crashes.\nRecently I got the Steam version for a cheap price. Its nearly as bad as it was when it was released.\nI simply cant bring myself to play this ♥♥♥♥ to end. Seriously. This game rapes me, I demand injury compensation!\n\nPositive:\n- Partly nice art design\n- I partly like the "evil" twin Postal Dude's design and new voice, cool that it was reused in Paradise Lost\n\nNegative:\n- Bugs and crashes\n- Perfornance problems\n- Sound mixing problems, too loud, too quiet, missing sounds, unfitting sounds\n- Melee weapons have a hit detection thats probably the worst ever\n- Unifitting unpostalish humor\n- No free roam\n- Boring repetitive missions\n- Trash, bad sort of trash\n- Bad English grammar and text\n- Russian quality in general... + Akella sucks\n\nIt may could have been a good game if they let RWS help with the developement. But instead there was silence between both devs and Akella just made it worse with fast releasing it. This was the death for the game.\nRWS regrets this game a lot and I doubt that there will ever be something like this happening again.","March 10","false","2.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","0"

I got to the second mission, where you have to use cat nip spray to get a bunch of HIV cats, however, there was a few problems.\n\n1: When a cat gets latched onto you, you have to spam left and right mouse to get it off. This wouldn't be a problem, but if you have the cat nip out, you can easily press right mouse, which consumes a ton of cat nip that's needed for the mission. Yes, it's limited. No, there are no refills (not as far as I could see)\n\n2: The Chinese gang never stopped attacking me. And this is the second level, where my only weapons are cats, cat nip spray, and a vacuum. They had pistols, machetes, and M16s. Little unfair. Also, they never stopped respawning, leaving little time for me to grab the cats. I ended up having to throw a cat at one of the guys to grab a machete, which took some time. Which brings me to point 3.\n\n3: Some weapons are broken. My favorite weapon from Postal 2, the machete, is reduced to a useless toy. The main attack took many attacks, and throwing it like a boomerang was hard. The machete wasn't thrown at the crosshair, rather below it, and even then it would miss a ton of targets. Also, it got stuck often, even when thrown in an open space.\n\nAfter dying 3 times, the game crashed. I was dissapointed in this game. The gore is better than Postal 2 in my opinion, but there's so many glitches and the game is unfair on the earliest levels. Although, I'm probably one of the few who's okay with the new voice actor (mainly because Akella actually offered to have Rick Hunter voice the game, though he refused) and while some lines were pretty funny to me ("I blame pacman.") some lines pretty much made me cringe. ("Bacon bacon bacon!" and other fire related lines) I also think I heard him say a really old meme (the cheeseburger one) but since this game was made in 2011 I can excuse that.\n\nIf you do plan on getting this game, turn off motion blur at the start. It'll save you a lot of headaches.\n\n","May 23","false","0.8"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","10","14","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mewcat97/recommended/10220/","Mewcat97","Mewcat97","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mewcat97/","74 products in account","Short ReviewPostal 3 is not a masterpiece and isn’t as good as the second one, but still enjoyable if you like the Postal series and don’t mind buggy gameplay and an occasional crash, consider buying the game on sale.\nOverall Score: 62/100\n\nExtensive ReviewRight off the bat, I love the Postal games for being violent, funny and because the Postal Dude is an epic protagonist. If you loved Postal 2 and want more, Postal 3 is probably right for you. It is by far not as good or as bug-free, but entertaining none the less. Get it when it is on sale, because it sadly isn’t worth the 20$ they want. I got it on sale and regret nothing.\n\nCampaign & Story\nIt is a lot shorter than Postal 2 but instead offers different branches based on your actions during missions. This means you can replay the game a good 3 times and will have new content or at least a different story. The narrator and characters are funny, and the dialogue fits the Postal series nicely. The cutscenes have an annoying film grain, but are still funny. The story is not meant to be taken seriously and progresses nicely. But let’s face it, we play Postal to kill people and not to evaluate the Dude’s life choices.\n\nGraphics & Performance\nHere is where the game is weak. Many others report crashes, poor frame rates and bugs. I experienced that as well, but if you are patient (not mashing your mouse when the game freezes for a sec) and change the settings to suit your system you should be fine. I did not run the game at ultra settings because programming wise it is not optimized and sometimes the animations are poorly integrated. Movement controls and aiming are not ideal, and some maps or many enemies might lag at times. Loading screens are long, but that might just be my rig. All these performance issues DO NOT take away from the game being fun and enjoyable. If you are willing to live with some issues you can still have a blast with Postal 3. It ran fairly well and smooth for me for the most part.\n\nGameplay and Experience\nThe gameplay is okay and you get used to it not being great quickly. Movement and looking work fine, and the NPCs are responsive (not as good as Postal 2, but still fun to kill). They used some similar voice actors or audio files and many references are made to the previous game. There are plenty of weapons to choose from, including a freaking badger and angry bees. You can urinate, incinerate people, and ride a segway. Overall it is fun and the gore is nice as well. It is different from Postal 2, and if you keep in mind that essentially a team of fans made this with the source engine, any “disappointments” won’t bother you. The achievements are bugged, but you can get a good 70%.\n\nConclusion\nIf you love the Postal series and this game is on sale, go get it. It is fun, silly and amusing for a piece of garbage. If you can look past some performance issues, this game is great! Seriously, I enjoyed every minute of it but get it on sale. If you don’t like it then it’s 5$ gone and not 20$. I highly recommend it to Postal fans. I regret nothing!","February 1","true","18.6"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","12","18","0","0"

I missed people running up to stop near me and say "I..." only to begin vomiting blood and die - because of some devious mischief I had nothing at all to do with, I promise.

Akella has ruined the macabre concept of the Postal Dude, getting a new voice actor, and removing jumping and replacing it with a faulty cover system.\n\nHell, the only way to have fun in this game is heavily mod it. The only realistic model in this game is of Postal Dude, with every single civilian appearing to be a cartoon character from a Disney film. Commanding Champ to take out enemies just straight up doesn't work, you are better off using the helper monkey which appears literally once in the game. The third person view is not that bad, but then you realize Akella probably did that to make the Postal series more like a GTA clone.\n\nThe whole good/bad paths in the game do not mean anything. In a game where you can amputate a mans arm, throw it at another person, all while urinating on them, the game punishes you severely for doing anything close to bad. And if you select the good path, the game is no fun, whatsoever. Nobody confronts you (except Osama Bin Laden) and because the game is on rails, being wanted by the police means nothing. There isn't even a system that allows you to know you are wanted, you just do soemthing, and every single officer unloads on you. To make that worse, you can't evade them until you die.\n\nThe high note in this game is the weapons. I mean, a badger on a stick that you can have maul people to death, it's crazy. Krotchy doll nukes, the shop-vac, all were great ideas, but had a very poor execution.\n\nThe demo shown in 2007 had better graphics, gameplay, and overall feel than this game.\nAt best, this is something a college student would make in Unity3D. 3.5/10\n\n","November 9, 2015","false","116.7"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","58","15","26","7","0"

Of course though there are some glitches here and there, and the game messed up on me a few times but the point is I had a lot of fun.\nPeople say it's a bad game up and down and I loved Postal 2 and the movie so I wondered. "How bad can it be?"\nSo I got it when it was on sale, Played the whole game, and got the good ending. When I finished it and got returned to the main menu I smiled sense it was, as said, SO MUCH FUN!!! I thought. "Why on earth does this game get so much hate?"\n\nThen, I freakin' realized it.\n\nPostal 2 and Postal III are completely different! Number two was a first person shooter where you could explore the whole town, do what ever you want, had crazy fictional weapons, and had a story that you can not change. Where as Postal III is a third person shooter where you go from mission to mission with no controll, the story AND mission are changed by the choices you make (meaning not only you get a different story but you do different missions), had different guns and weapon types instead of crazy weapons (but there were some weird weapons like the aids infected cats you can throw), and the ending is changed NOT ONLY by the choices you make, it is also changed depending on if you where a bad guy or good guy.\nFor example, if I went through the game murdering bystanders and only using my guns I would get the (not gonna tell you which ending you get if you do so :3), but if I went through the game not hurting bystanders and tazing the bad guys who don't have guns I would get the (Still not gonna tell you which ending you'll get if you do so XD).\n\nHope you read all of this and made your choice on if your going to get this game or not.\n\nP.S. If you do get the game, just remember that you should save a lot so if your PC can't let you play it with out exiting you out of it every few hours (like mine did :P) you won't have to restart levels... or worse... have to replay the mission before the one you were on...","December 27, 2013","true","14.1"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","20","37","0","0"

(wish I hadn't).\nClicked Play. I saw a picture of Uve Boll sticking his finger up at me, The game then crashed. Yep, that's basically my expectations for the rest of the game. I then started the tutuorial and was told to ingite some zombies. INGITE. (That's not my spelling mistake, that's exactly how it was spelt and what the game told me to do.\n\nThey've also slaughtered the Source engine, it's no wonder we don't have Half-Life 3. Valve had to make another engine after this game was released.\n\nAlso, for those of you that like your Source console commands and your Postal experience in 1st person mode. You get to eat ♥♥♥♥ because typing firstperson into the console tells you that the game is already in first person. (even though the whole game takes place in 3rd person). Entering thirdperson makes the camera aim straight at the floor. So instead of using the default 3rd person mode that Source uses they've decided to use the first person mode and pull the camera back, for some reason.\n\nI was also told not to press a button, so I'm not whilst I currently wait for the game to progress. After I spent waiting the game started to insult me for doing exactly what it told me to do.\n\nThe people that made this game should kill themselves. I'm not joking.

The voice acting is great, the jokes are funny, which is all fine and dandy. The UI is theme-appropriate and unintrusive, and the weapon drawings are nicely charming. The fact that the actions you make in a mission decide how the rest of it plays out, and even the next mission that occurs adds for some novel replay value. The opening cartoon cutscenes are also VERY nicely done. The creativity really shines with the outrageous weapons like the BadgerSaw.\n\nRight, that's all the praise I can give Postal III. Now onto it's problems. Yes, the weapon selection is good and creative.... unfortunately the devs didn't finish a handful more of funny weapons like Napalm Rocket, Dead Pigeons, Sniper Rifle, C4 and scissors. I don't know if that's down to laziness or just an unfortunate case of the game being rushed out, but it's kind of annoying, There was also meant to be a healing item in the game: Pizza. It actually appears in some maps and has an inventory icon, but again it's unfinished. This is a shame as the game has some degree of difficulty and having that item would be beneficial.\n\nAlso, in early 2010, the devs scrapped the playermodel of The Postal Dude that RWS made themselves, replacing it with one made by the russian devs. Not only did that slow down production (they'd have to remake all those cutscenes) but the new model is ♥♥♥♥ing awful as sin, and one of my key problems with the game. Luckily, there's mods online you can install to restore the original, better, RWS-made Postal Dude model, so hoorah.\n\nThen there's just the issue of the game being full of bugs, unfinished so to speak. The escort AI is awful, there are certain parts of missions that have been cut out entirely (training Champ through a box maze, using matches to escape a prison cell, firing ♥♥♥ wads into a flaming dumpster), the gasoline goes through the floor etc. Maybe if they hadn't spent all that time changing Dude's model and remaking those cutscenes then they'd have had time to add the removed weapons and remove the added bugs. Really, it's frustrating. In it's current state, I'd give Postal III a 5/10. Had they fixed all the ♥♥♥♥ I mentioned above then maybe it could score a 7/10.","January 3","true","50.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It was licensed to Akella in hopes of developing a next generation Postal game, but thanks to the Russian recession Akella went bankrupt and all developmental work went to a fledgling "b-team." The results were catastrophic, as what was once intended to be an open ended and graphically impressive Postal became a bug-ridden mess.\n\nAlthough its price can never be justified even at 50% off, I will say that for those who already own it, two things about this game are decent. First is the free-roam feature that is unlocked after completing those horrid story missions. If you really can't stand playing through it, which few can, there are ways to bypass the missions that a simple Google search will yield. The free-roam itself is mediocre, as there are few things to do but walk around and slaughter a few civilians until the game crashes, but it's much more rewarding than the series of tutorials that constitute the main game.\n\nThe second feature worth mentioning was a joke that occurred... I'd say about halfway through the game, where the Alternative Postal Dude is approaching a building being held up by rather incompetent shooters. In the midst of the inaccurate bullet fest, a peacekeeper attempts to approach the building only to have his head blown off. The Postal Dude then exclaims, "holy s***, did they level up?" It made me laugh, anyways.\n\nThat's really all that's worth experiencing in Postal III. You're much better off paying a fraction of Postal III's price to own the real Postal games.","June 18, 2015","false","9.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","15"

The project started out great with both groups working close together, then the first blow came with the Russian economy taking a hit and Akella lost their A development team and the project got moved to Team B. Looking back now we should have canceled the project then as there was no way the new less qualified team was going to be able to deliver a “A” quality game. The next big blow was when Akella started chopping away at our design (to accommodate the limited skills of the 2nd string team), this only got worse over time. From eliminating gameplay to single player only to PC only and scratching consoles. The hole kept getting deeper and the ♥♥♥♥ shovel was in full force. We didn't even get to see or play the game in the last 12 months of development, then the worst thing happened. Akella was desperate for money trying to prevent going out of business. They made the fatal decision to ‘wrap it up’ at alpha and call it done, releasing it to the Russian market, then on Steam for the international market.\n\nAkella retains control of all the source code and assets for Postal III which they will not share with us or the modding community, so we are unable to fix Postal III ourselves, leaving a flawed and unfinished game. RWS also do not profit from Postal III sales and we stopped selling it ourselves the moment it was clear we would be unable to support the product.\n\nPostal III is not without some redeeming features for fans of POSTAL: graphically it looks nice, the cutscene art and music was decent and it has some interesting unique weapons such as the Badger Saw. The branching storyline and Good versus Bad system allows you to replay the game and encounter new levels, alternative scenes and it even allows you to complete the objectives differently. The game at least knows it’s a train wreck and will often make fun of itself during the objective screens.","December 30, 2011","false","80.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DudeDesigns/recommended/10220/","DudeDesigns","DudeDesigns","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DudeDesigns/","254 products in account","From my original review, Postal III was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful sequel to Postal 2.\n\nHowever, let's take it back a few notches.\n\nPostal III is a third person shooter, unlike Postal 2, which was a first person shooter. The game, gameplay wise, is similar to Postal 2. You shoot ♥♥♥♥ and perform tasks.\nHowever, Postal III introduces alignment. You can be good, or bad, and depending on your actions, you get different endings. For example, helping cops bust a hippie pot ring aligns you Good. Killing everyone during the bust aligns you Bad. That is a pretty cool feature that makes this game one of the more unique Postal games.\n\nThe game makes outside references to the likes of people such as the infamous director Uwe Boll, Gary Coleman from Postal 2, and other such things. It's got the Postal feel, and everything that is there is great, but it doesn't work all the time.\n\nThat's really my only main complaint with the game. Due to layoffs and rushes, the game is extremely buggy, and crashes often. The game runs on Valve's Source Engine.\n\nPostal III on the inside has all the mechanics and gameplay aspects to make a good Postal game.\nHowever, on the outside, it's a buggy mess that crashes often, has gameplay breaking bugs such as cutscenes not playing, parts of the map unrendering, and other such things.\n\nIt's price isn't really warranted, considering it is a buggy crashing mess. If you get it gifted, or buy it out of curiosity, you might be dissapointed, but the game itself is still enjoyable if you can look passed it's flaws.","August 14, 2013","false","13.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Don't come into this expecting fluid gun control and movement. There are MANY bugs. I have not encountered any that are breakable to the story but more a laughing matter. But they do not overall detract from the humorous gameplay and storyline behind the the sadley aged source engine used. However the good/bad moral alignment can be a little difficult as some missions require you to be bad to complete them. Again, not a major issue for somebody willing to take the time to look past these issues and play it in the same thought as the prequels. Even the controls feel the same. A fun romp through a wild story filled with cursing and blood spurts so over the top you would think they were made to look that way. Hell, you can craft a gun that shoots a cat off it by its butt hole!!! Running with scissors, you have done a good job in all the harsh remarks this game brought with it.

Even worse, the publisher has disavowed Postal III completely, and they refuse to fix it or improve it in any way, shape, or form.\n\nNot only is Postal III a buggy piece of crap, it fares no better gameplay-wise. Despite being an open-world game, the story forces you down a particular path, and you aren't allowed to free roam until you've completed all the missions. The weapons suck, the graphics suck, the environments suck, the sound effects suck. Absolutely everything about Postal III sucks.

It wasn't.  It was trashy, poorly coded, and its humour was more groan worthy than anything.  But goddamit, it WAS fun in some sick, twisted way - particularly when aided by the "A Week in Paradise" mod that expanded its variety and fixed a lot of its bugs, etc.  It was a cathartic experience that let you indulge in a bit of depravity to let the stress flow by.  "Postal III" on the other hand, is a torture simulator at the players expense - not the NPCs.  This game is abysmally bad.  The hit detection is the worst I've ever experienced in a game, and even when you do hit there's no sense of tactile feedback.  There is not a single weapon in this game, except perhaps the Badger, that is in any way satisfying to use.  About the only praise I can give this game in ANY sense is that while the humour is still pretty rank, there are a few more genuinely good, surreal jokes that might hit low brow sensibilities.  I actually did laugh once or twice when the joke wasn't "Misogyny/gross stuff" etc.  This is the most broken ♥♥♥ game I've ever seen released that took so long to make, this was in development as far back as 2004 and yet it feels like a proof of concept alpha - a proof of concept that in any true quality assurance workers mind, would not see as proving any viable concept at all.  Its linear, broken, and practically unplayable.  Say what you will about Postal 2 and its flaws - but at least everyone can agree that this one is legitimately pure ♥♥♥♥.","February 16, 2014","false","14.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game, gameplay wise, is similar to Postal 2. You shoot ♥♥♥♥ and perform tasks.\nHowever, Postal III introduces alignment. You can be good, or bad, and depending on your actions, you get different endings. For example, helping cops bust a hippie pot ring aligns you Good. Killing everyone during the bust aligns you Bad. That is a pretty cool feature that makes this game one of the more unique Postal games.\n\nThe game makes outside references to the likes of people such as the infamous director Uwe Boll, Gary Coleman from Postal 2, and other such things. It's got the Postal feel, and everything that is there is great, but it doesn't work all the time.\n\nThat's really my only main complaint with the game. Due to layoffs and rushes, the game is extremely buggy, and crashes often. The game runs on Valve's Source Engine.\n\nPostal III on the inside has all the mechanics and gameplay aspects to make a good Postal game.\nHowever, on the outside, it's a buggy mess that crashes often, has gameplay breaking bugs such as cutscenes not playing, parts of the map unrendering, and other such things.\n\nIt's price isn't really warranted, considering it is a buggy crashing mess. If you get it gifted, or buy it out of curiosity, you might be dissapointed, but the game itself is still enjoyable if you can look passed it's flaws.","August 14, 2013","false","13.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

It's not their fault as they handed the development off to a russian company that started having financial troubles and had to lay off their prime team because they couldn't afford to pay them anymore. Instead, they fell back to the backup team which couldn't handle most of the intended design, and the game had to be extensively redesigned to accomodate their lack of experience and skill. I believe the company has completely shut down now, and won't give RWS the source code so they could properly clean it up and perfect it.

Talk about one of the worst products ever made, in just about every way possible. Unlike the previous postal, the game/level design is painfully linear with little to no room to explore. The third-person POV also feels really awkward, and using weapons and such feels really clunky. Loading times are atrociously long and the game itself is full of bugs that will probably never be fixed.\n\nWhat's worse than all those things is that Postal 3 was really poorly optimized. It doesn't matter whether your gaming rig is decent or top-notch, you'll get random lagspikes and frame drops. Oh and the game crashes entirely too often, and for no apparent reason. Certainly not the game I was expecting, considering this game took several years of waiting to come out...ugh. The humor also feels really offensive, in Postal 2 the humor felt at least somewhat funny, but in Postal 3 it feels like they were being offensive for the sake of being offensive.\n\nIn short, Postal 3 felt like a huge waste of money and time I've spent playing it. RWS themselves deny having anything to do with Postal 3, and the gamers themselves refer to it as "the russian postal" instead of a sequel.

Talk about one of the worst products ever made, in just about every way possible. Unlike the previous postal, the game/level design is painfully linear with little to no room to explore. The third-person POV also feels really awkward, and using weapons and such feels really clunky. Loading times are atrociously long and the game itself is full of bugs that will probably never be fixed.\n\nWhat's worse than all those things is that Postal 3 was really poorly optimized. It doesn't matter whether your gaming rig is decent or top-notch, you'll get random lagspikes and frame drops. Oh and the game crashes entirely too often, and for no apparent reason. Certainly not the game I was expecting, considering this game took several years of waiting to come out...ugh. The humor also feels really offensive, in Postal 2 the humor felt at least somewhat funny, but in Postal 3 it feels like they were being offensive for the sake of being offensive.\n\nIn short, Postal 3 felt like a huge waste of money and time I've spent playing it. RWS themselves deny having anything to do with Postal 3, and the gamers themselves refer to it as "the russian postal" instead of a sequel. After playing it, I can hardly blame them. 0.5/5.0","June 15, 2014","false","16.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Seeing as how the second one was badass and amazingly better than some of the AAA games we get served today, so i bought it, played it and beat it, and now i now why this game is slandered, even RWS has given up on this trainwreck but before i trash this game more i have to say there are parts of this game that are good but far from being awesome.\n\nLike my review of Postal 2, this review will broken down in the same areas\n\nGameplay, Graphics, Sound and most importantly Story\n\nWarning: this is my opinon and if anything offends you, i deeply apolgize\n\nGameplay 5/10: the overall gmeplay isn't all to bad, the controls aren't bad but they are a big difference from its predecessor, the main control feature i like about this game is you don't have to use the mouse scroll for changing your guns, you can now use X and C for that which for me (being a console gamer for 16 years) is a big up for me since i'm still new to the PC controls. The game praises it's so called "advanced AI" but in reality the so-called "advanced AI" isn't so advanced unless advanced AI means running in your line of fire and killing all the "advanced AI" in like two seconds\n\nGraphics 6/10: the graphics of this game are not that bad but also not that good for a game that was realeased in 2011. there are times where the graphics acutally look complete and then other times your face palming with more regert than Patrick Stewert.\n\nSound 8/10: this is the only department that this game did good in. The BGM of this game is amazing, the only time the BGM is bad, is that it is stuck in a never-ending loop, so in the longer levels in the game it starts to become a ear ache. The sound F/X of this game is why the sound gets an 8 out of 10 instead of being a perfect score, the gun noises in this aren't as realistic as they were Postal 2, but they aren't horrible either, at least they are actually sounds instead of one guy making "pew-pew" noises.\n\nStory 6/10: the only reason this game's story did better than Postal 2 is because it's more of a linear based game, so there is more room for story, but the main reason ot only did a point better was becasue it's story was all over the f***ing place, when i finally beat the game, i had no f***ing idea what the f*** happend, the story has more holes in it than swiss cheese or a Micheal Bay movie (uggh don't get me started on him)\n\nOverall 4.5/10: Overall this game needs A LOT more work and if it was developed on for a little bit longer (i'd say like two more years) it may have been a better game but I personally think that it should have been the exact same game as the second but with a new story and graphics like Halo 3. (ahhh if only) But before i go, the nic people over at Anthology Production, are making a mod for Postal 2, and it's basically taking Postal 3 and putting it into the engine of the second game and more! So i cannot wait for it to come out. so as you can see I do NOT reccomend this game but if you really want to play this s***ty game than wait for that mod.","March 15, 2015","false","9.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game hasn't seen any fixes either.  I honestly can't recommend this game unless one day the devs decide it's worth fixing.  Even then the humor is tasteless & might have been funny or offensive in the early/late 90's.  Now, it's just childish & sad really.\n\nIf they ironed out the bugs it would be a decent 3rd person toilet humor shooter but with all the bugs, glitches, crashes & other problems the game has it's just a chore to try and play through it.\n\nI got this game when it came out, too.

Oh yeah, don't forget everyone's favorite: A shallow binary moral choice system! Going around on rampages is still somewhat fun, but there is no heart or soul in this game.

And I loved the humor and story of Postal 3. The only thing why I dont recommend this is the lackluster gameplay and the several technical Issues.\n\nPros:\n\n+ its Postal through and through, Sex , Violence, Racism, Animal Abuse and tons of other stuff that made this franchise famous\n+ the story is pretty funny\n+ many new and old weapons to choose from\n+ a new city to explore\n+ some celebrity characters\n+ great sense of humor and satire\n+ multiple paths to choose from, that actually change things up\n\n\nCons:\n\n- on a technical side the game is a complete mess. So many bugs,glitches and crashes, I will point out the worst one by one\n- a bug caused one of my save games to crash on being loaded.....that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off so much since I was far into the game\n- ALL the mlee weapons are absolutley useless.....you cant hit anything because they are so extremley poorly programmed - hit detection is a absurd\n- 3rd person view is pointless and even worse can trigger bugs and camera glitches.......why not stick with first person? This is a major downer!\n- ranged weapons feel way off when aiming, you can hit your targets but it just feels so bad to aim\n- gasoline is buggy and doesnt work like in postal 2, you cant pour it onto people anymore, they have to walk on the ground you´re pouring at (like I said, many special weapons are buggy)\n- way too many missions stick to the same formular - horde shooter where you have to take out certain people\n- many random crashes\n- you cant mount a cat on a gun -_-  seriously whos decision was it to remove this feature? Its like one of the most iconic things in Postal 2!\n- the explorable city is pretty small, there isnt much to actually do, I expected some kind of funny mini games, there are funny arcade cabins, but they are only cosmetic.....how disappointing\n- the enemy AI is none-existent.......they are so incredibly incompetent at doing anything\n- and like I said....many many bugs in missions and scripted events\n\nOh Postal.....I loved the second one, and the humor and one liners are back....but with such a horrible gameplay mechanics thats its barely playable. I played through the good campaign and it crashed too much on the bad campaign and I deinstalled in rage. If this gets waaaaay lower in price I can recommend this to a hardcore fan, other than that keep away from this.","December 2, 2014","false","7.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/guardspec/recommended/10220/","guardspec","Guardspec","http://steamcommunity.com/id/guardspec/","214 products in account","You will like this game, if you're a masochist!\n\nPostal 3, now officialy renamed Russian Postal, is game publised by the bancrupt Akella Studios and produced by (defunct at the game's release) studio Trashmasters. You play as Not the Postal  dude from Postal 2 by surviving an onslaught of whacky shenaningans in the city of Catharsis.The game is a linear third person shooter that pits you against ecologists, Asians and bees. Your arsenal ranges from graffiti cans to rabid badgers and shotguns. There are also moral choices to consider that eventually determine which ending you get at the completion of the campaign.\n\nSorry, the previous paragraph praising Russian Postal is made of lies and I am a terrible person, but hey, have an imaginary biscuit as a reward for reading this far! Now on to the actual review:\n\nRussian Postal is so terrible it's not even funny. The game has never been properly tested (if tested at all) upon its release which is noticable right from the moment you boot it up. If it doesn't crash, good for you, it will do so later, a bunch of times.   The main campaign is broken into missions which open as you progress through the story. They offer a variety of things from stealing sagways from gay bikers to protecting Uwe Boll from DnD nerds and trekkies, crammed with awkward stereotypes and 'hillarious' jokes. The little writing this game had really shines here when you scratch your head on reffereces that stopped being funny 10 years ago.\n\nGameplay wise the game is passable, but not anything stellar. Everything happends in third person and you use your mouse and keyboard to navigate, fire weapons, scroll your inventory and huff catnip. The problem is that most of the creative weapons like the badger saw, machete and the fart gun are ALL useless because physical damage is paltry and the hitboxes are broken to hell, which makes you swining at air instead of your assailants. It doesn't really help going mellee because every enemy in this game carries a machine gun and is also an ace shooter. The firearm encounters chew your ammunition in mere seconds and leave you with half-dozen unusable weapons  Therefore the game forces you to farm bullets from NPCs, which also mostly use mellee weapons...ah and the loading times between zones are atrocious. Fun!\n\nWhere little the game DOES shine are its cutscenes, which have some artistic merrit and are genuinely funny, but they are not worthy buying Russian Postal nor the pain of enduring it. My praise ends here.\n\nIn the end I can't really recommend this game to anyone, with the exception of gifting it as means to an end a frienship or a relationship. Postal fans will be dissappointed because it's a downgrade from the previous two games, achievers won't be satisfied either because some trophies are not attainable due to poor coding. If you are a masochist and enjoy playing broken games with zero satisfaction, this one is right up your alley!\n\nFinal verdict: two thumbs down and a fart /10","May 12, 2014","false","20.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

But me being a postal fan I gave it a chance and I think despite the road they went down with Postal 3, its not to bad. The good/bad system is really interesting, and the different missions do keep it playable. There is a some-what freemode to it, and you can cause a lot of carnage. The effects are pretty awesome, and the fact you can shoot cops from a segway lol. but the lack of a few things really bums me out like  a suicide button which was the prime thing that made postal unique, that fact you could kill yourself at anytime made it really different from other games.\nPostal 3 is just a far far cry from Postal and postal 2, and thats why they messed up. Again though if you are a fan like me, you may enjoy it even though its glitchy as hell. If you do play. I recommend going to the fourm and looking at the topic on how to reduce lag and frametear. Once I did those little things in my auto.cfg for the game.

It is still a great and fun game, but for me it is not ''Postal''. It is much more sane, even too sane to be honoust. It is VERY short, it has much less black humor in it. Gosh! I miss those fat ladies showing their middle finger and moving their jaw weirdly as they speak. Now it is not as insane, not as chaotic and above all, it is not a fee roam game.

This game will likely get low scores and upset fanboys because it comes accross as a parody of itself.  Anyways:  It is a Third Person action game with tons of random and sick humor in small mission based levels.\n\nThe method you use to solve the missions are very limited compared to Postal 2 because either you do things in a evil way or a good way... how you do the missions results in what type of mission you do next.\n\nYou could play the whole game killing everyone and getting evil missions or as a cop doing good things and saving people.  The whole game has alternative pathways so since I did a good guy, I missed at least 1/3 of the game of bad guy levels.\n\nThe weapons are fun and killing people is fun, but overall the game feels rushed and humor is forced.  Not worth the $40.00, but I could say it would be worth $20.00 if you love sick humor and killing people with strange weapons like killer Cats.","February 19, 2012","false","7.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It verges on unplayable even on modern-day gaming machines, you'll die of old age before anything loads, and the gameplay itself is like some condensed, badly-interpreted Bollywood version of Postal 2.\n\nCons:\n-Awful performance\n-Massive loading times\n-Broken AI\n-Confusing mission parameters (not helped by glitches barring progress)\n-Lifeless humor and writing\n-No Rick Hunter (voice of the original Postal Dude)\n\nPros:\n-Music is actually decent at times\n-Served as a good punchline in Postal 2: Paradise Lost\n-Ability to shoot Uwe Boll\n\nOverall, don't buy it, even on sale. Every time I actually had the game stable enough to run, glitches often barred my progress and asinine missions suck away the fun that a few portions of the game manage to provide. This is a poor attempt at a Postal game. It shucks off the (very slight) darkness that Postal 2 retained from its predecessor in order to be a dense, wacky caricature of Postal 2, and it fails on most every regard.","January 10","false","6.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","1","6","0","0"

After fixing it by modifying the game scripts because the game is a technical failure.\n\nI never liked Postal 2. It's attempt to be South Park didn't work for me. Because I don't live in America, and satire doesn't make me laugh at all.\nPostal III seems to have dropped any and all notion of satire. The humor in this game is juvenile at its best and braindead at its worst. But I'll gladly take this over Postal 2.\nGameplay wise, the game is now a linear third person shooter. The open world of Postal 2 will be certainly missed. But thankfully there is a free-roam mode after you finish the game (eventhough the map size is still pathetic).\nAs a third person shooter, the game is competent with a decent variety in weapons. And there is still the dark joy in slicing up innocents then beating someone with another person's head. But oddly enough this game has a morality meter. Killing people will give you negative points. However if you decide to go the "Good" path killing enemies don't give you negative points. However, if you fail optional missions you get negative points. Conversely, killing anyone in the "Evil" Path will give you negative points, but failing optional missions do nothing. I liked the morality meter. It somewhat rewards people who plays nice by giving you an extra mission at the end.\nGraphically, the game doesn't look good. It has a decent cartoony caricature-vibe going for it. But the textures are grainy, and character animations are so stiff that it surprised me that the game used the Source engine; The engine that is famous for expressive animations.\nTechnically, the game is a mess. The game isn't coded to use multi-core by default. Resulting in lag and long loading times. The game would crash during loading screens as well. Thankfully some of the problems can be fixed by altering the files. (More info here http://nienpaper.wordpress.com/2012/02/03/postal-3-fix-performance-crash-fix/)\n\nHowever, even with all of that. I like this game. I don't know why. It's shamelessly dumb but maybe that was the charm. Get the game when it's on sale for like 5 bucks or less. You'll atleast get some laughs.","October 7, 2014","true","16.0"," 4 of 20 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","4","20","0","0"

Postal 3 may have not been nowhere near the game of the year but if you love very very VERY dark and occasionally funny humor and Jokes that wont nessacerily make you laugh on the outside then the Postal Series/Postal 3 is worth running with scissor's regular price of 20 dollars, Its not a bad game if you find out a way to get past the bugs and empty holes the developers didnt care enough to fill. Postal 3 is entertaining and worth the time playing it, it's a very stupid game and I never said it was a good game I just think its not as stupid as south park even though South Park is quadruple x10 more popular then Postal.

If you can snag it at below $10 you'll find it's just as delightfully offensive as Postal 2. That being said, it has  LOT of shortcomings compared to Postal 2 (like the lack of an open world and SUPER terribad optimization issues), but after my time with it, I'd say "eh, it's still fun to taze monkeys, cats, dogs, and people and then pee on them before riding off on a segway to protect mayor Ron Jeremy because he's running for president (I think, I don't really remember, things were so crazy).\n\nUnfortunately you WILL have to reload the game a lot because of bugged missions, and you WILL hate the dumbass morality meter (which sometimes doesn't seem to work), but overall, it's offensively innoffensive with a fun arsenal of weapons and the same complete disdain for the player and the world that characterizes Postal.\n\nI only recommend it on a DEEP price cut, however.","July 1, 2015","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The voice acting is atrocious, the NPCs could not be any more vapid and shallow. The guns are unsatisfying, and most of the other weapons are just plain stupid and have no purpose other than shock value.\nI can't wrap my mind around how this "game" ever got the green light to get this far.

Postal 3 may have not been nowhere near the game of the year but if you love very very VERY dark and occasionally funny humor and Jokes that wont nessacerily make you laugh on the outside then the Postal Series/Postal 3 is worth running with scissor's regular price of 20 dollars, Its not a bad game if you find out a way to get past the bugs and empty holes the developers didnt care enough to fill. Postal 3 is entertaining and worth the time playing it, it's a very stupid game and I never said it was a good game I just think its not as stupid as south park even though South Park is quadruple x10 more popular then Postal.

Fundamental sound issues. AWFUL dialogue, and not in the cheeky Postal 2 way - lots of it is just directly copied from 2. Giant walls of text explaining the mundane tasks you need to accomplish. Melee weapons are largely useless as characters seems to slide past each other like they're greased. The animations and models seem like they simply put higher res textures on the models from Postal 2. Social commentary that would make a Che Guevara t-shirt seem well considered.

It's a poorly made 3rd person coverbased shooter that goes from bad cutscenes to bad gameplay back to bad cutscenes. THERE IS A FORCED TUTORIAL MISSION AT THE BEGINING CALLED "CROSS THE BRIDGE" OR SOME ♥♥♥♥ AND YOU MOSTLY CROSS THE BRIDGE IN ♥♥♥♥ING CUTSCENES!!!\n\nBottom line the Postal series is a game set in a shared universe that is full of crude, immature shock comedy... and that isn't a bad thing. Frankly, I'm nostalgiaic over the first one. I played it a lot as a kid and at the time I took the whole thing as a big joke meant to offend people (which a great portion of it reall is just that), and my cousin played it, I shared it with all my friends back when I had the physical copy... It's the worlds wierdest "kids" game lol. BUT Postal 3 has horrible UI, hit detection, level design, has the worst graphics of a Source powered game that I've ever scene... Get Postal 2: Paradise Lost and the Workshop MODs. ♥♥♥♥ Postal III!","December 26, 2015","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The worst part is that this game actually gave me herpes. As I played this game I found that my fingers started breaking out in blemishes which then spread to my arms.
