It's almost really good, but a few things stop it from shining.\n\nI feel like I would have enjoyed the game a lot more if it was a bit easier. The difficulty around the middle of the game was perfect, but the last few levels were just frustrating. I loved Super Meat Boy, and managed to 100% that game, but I really don't want to go through that kind of torture again, especially from a game that looks so cute.\n\nThere's also a lot of minor bugs in the game, that add up and start to get a bit annoying. In the level with the moving squares of water, the music broke when in the water, and got so distorted that I had to mute my audio. Fireballs sometimes clearly hit me but I don't die. Stuff like that.\n\nRocks really annoyed me. I kept thinking they were part of the background! So many deaths caused by running into rocks.\n\nThe graphics are also kind of bland. They're passable, but just... not that interesting or appealing.\n\nAnyway! The game still has some solid platforming gameplay, and the gravity and swimming mechanics were implemented very well and were surprisingly intuitive. Collecting sea creatures was satisfying, and I got all of them so far in the first 16 zones, minus one.\n\nFans of Super Meat Boy should check this game out, if they want something very similar. Possibly not worth full price, but worth picking up if you're a fan of the genre and it's on sale.\n","September 10, 2015","true","5.7"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","26","30","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleskesvor/recommended/317250/","fleskesvor","flesk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleskesvor/","797 products in account","Airscape is a playful gravity platformer that feels like an essential buy to any fan of challenging platformers, and is a joy both to play and watch.\n\nA demo for Linux, Windows and Mac can be found here.\n\nThe story starts when you and your group of octopuses are suddenly abducted from your peaceful home inside a water-filled asteroid. You're all lifted up through the sky by a massive tractor beam, but you alone happen to fall off and come crashing down on an unfamiliar planet. Dazed and confused, you have but one thought; to reunite with your friends.\n\nThrough the first few levels, Airscape is relatively standard platformer fare. You can walk, jump and run, and you have to avoid minor obstacles, like pits and moving enemies. In each level, you'll find a small amount of sea critters held captive in orbs, and your objective is to rescue as many as possible of these and make it to the goal pad. Some of these sea critters are timed challenges, and if you can't make it to them in time, a spacecraft will arrive to take them away. Their locations will still be marked though, so if you see an empty dotted circle, you'll know what you have to do.\n\nAfter making it through the first zone, the space map opens up, and you'll see the next zone of levels, as well as a fortified containment level. From now on you're free to zip through space and select levels as you wish. There are four containment levels in total, and for every one of them you beat, you open up a few more zones on the map, until you've unlocked all 15 and the final boss. Here's where you also get a bit more freedom of choice: Each containment level holds one of your octopus kin captive, and when you release an octopus, it's added to your lineup to choose from at the start of each subsequent level. The different octopuses have their own unique skills, which facilitate different play styles, and it's likely that you'll find a favorite among them. Some can't run, but compensate for their lack of speed through other means. One octopus can slow down time in its near vicinity, and is thus a good choice for when things start getting hectic. There is also a teleporting octopus, which has the ability to zap straight past certain obstacles. It requires a bit of precision though, since it's easy to smash straight into the ground or an enemy, but this octopus seems like a good option once you start learning the ropes.\n\nThe way gravity works is that there's a pull perpendicular to whichever surface you're closest to. In effect this means that if you're going uphill, the surface will tilt towards you to keep you on a level plane, and if a jump brings you closer to the ground above you, you'll flip around and fall towards that surface. In water, there's no concept of gravity, and you're free to move whichever way you want. There are hotkeys to adjust the screen rotation rate while playing, so it's easy to adjust rotation to a level you find comfortable.\n\nOne of the game's main strengths, in my opinion, is that there's a ton of variation; not just in enemy types and obstacles, but also in game mechanics and design. The gravity mechanics enable a level design where the ground not only is functional, but also has a curved and visually appealing topography. There are both low and no gravity levels, and even a level with alternating gravity. Enemies range from robotic tanks and aggressive UFOs to sniper rifles, homing missiles, huge showers of meteors, and a bunch more.\n\nEach zone have their own orchestral musical themes. I'm especially fond of Eclipse, which has sort of a gothic rock opera feel to it. At least that's what I'm imagining it to be, though I don't have anything to compare it with for reference. You'll find the soundtrack on Bandcamp[samulis.bandcamp.com], where you can give it a free listen before deciding to pay-what-you-want for high-quality downloads. The visuals are colorful and clean, and though there isn't a ton of variation in textures, there's an attention to detail that makes the world feel alive. Like the leaves and cotton balls floating around in the foreground, and plants jiggling a bit when you walk past them. There are also some subtle changes in the expressions of the octopus protagonists, like when their eyes bulge slightly when an enemy is near. Another thing that I found adorable is how when you rescue sea animals, they bob about in a trail behind you throughout the rest of the level.\n\nIt took me slightly less than 12 hours to rescue enough sea critters to unlock the boss encounter and get through the game. That time also includes finding and completing two hidden levels and well over 2000 deaths and retries. There are more than enough sea creatures to rescue to complete the game, and since difficulty varies between levels and your choice of octopus and player skill, you might find that you'll get through the game faster. The hidden levels can be unlocked by finding a hidden exit in some of the levels, and levels with such exits are marked on the map once you've rescued every animal in them.\n\nThe game can be played with either a keyboard or a gamepad, and though I prefer keyboard controls, my wired Xbox 360 controller works well both in menus and in-game. Most input buttons can be remapped, and in addition to movement and screen rotation, there's also an input to quickly restart from the last checkpoint. There are a few graphical settings that can be tweaked, but I had no problems running the game at a stable 60FPS on my laptop with Linux Mint 17 KDE and GeForce GT 630M. I did eventually decide to turn a few settings to low, but only because the back- and foreground effects started to give me a hint of motion sickness. By default, the game will try to adjust settings to give you a stable performance, but this can be turned off if you prefer to tune things manually. There's also a timer that can be turned on and will be displayed in the upper left corner, which should be handy for speedrunners.\n\nAirscape is unlike anything I've played, and though it looks like a Super Mario Galaxy in 2D, you should expect something closer to Super Meat Boy or Dustforce DX in terms of difficulty. The game has a fair share of checkpoints though, so less experienced players should still be able to get through it with some persistence. I finished the game a week ago, but I'm far from done with it, and have been picking it up for a bit every day since to try to rescue more sea creatures and uncover more secrets.\n\nNOTE: This review was originally published on GamingOnLinux[www.gamingonlinux.com].","September 11, 2015","true","16.5"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","17","22","2","6"

This indie title was developed by students from around the world, and its simple premise allows for the focus to be solely on the gameplay, rather than the story of a platformer game that really doesn’t need one.\n\nWhen you hit solid ground for the first time, after a some kind of a movement tutorial,  the feeling is surprisingly familiar. As you may guess, you don't stay there for too long. Soon enough you start floating around and defying the laws of gravity. Your little octopus is able to sprint, run and jump its way around the level, and even backtrack or spin around itself in all possible directions.\n\nI often found that many sections of Airscape required a lot more thought than some classic side-scrollers and you really can't rely on any kind of luck when progressing. Everything is thought-out perfectly and it's up to you to step up to the challenge. There sure is alot, and I really mean alot of trial and error in Airscape, so it’s definitely a positive circumstance that level times don’t have an impact on any scoring in the game.\n\nThere is no score system in Airscape whatsoever, you progress along by means of gathering collectibles and thus unlocking future stages. Here, these take the form of a variety of sea-bound critters held captive by the mysterious glowing, circular machines. Guiding your octopus to the end of each stage is barely even half of the battle, and it’s in freeing these captive sea critters where the real challenge lies.\n\nThe gravity-based puzzles are extremely interesting, and the original mix of liquid and land plains makes for some snappy button mashing from time to time. Precision is everpresent, that is obvious from the very first level.At some aspects Airscape's inovations really do extend far enough to make it a really great game, although overall floaty style can occasionally make it as frustrating as it is interesting.\n\nOne thing I really regret is that you can't kill off your enemies by any means. Sure, the game isn't designed in a way that you could directly kill, but at some occasions it would really be a neat touch.\n\nAirscape: The Fall of Gravity is a amazing example of platformer-puzzler game with a quirky premise and many interesting mechanics. I've personally been waiting for a chgallenge like this since the release of Super Meat Boy, some years ago.\n\nThose who stick with it until the end, or should we say – those who are skilled enough to actually finish the game, will definitely be in for a rewarding and different experience.\n\nFULL REVIEW[pcgamesnnews.wordpress.com]","September 6, 2015","true","26.6"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

Airscape is a game that gives the finger to all things oriented and flips all the platformers you love upside down and squirts ink in their face. Things seem simple at first as you and your octopi family are seemingly abducted and dropped into some sort of floating islands. Things start off casually enough for any beginner platformer and then suddenly everything gets flipped on its head. Pun intended. What makes Airscape good is that the difficulty ramps up significantly and challenges you in unique ways that play with the idea of gravity and momentum. The level design is superb and this shows in the 60+ levels. On top of that the controls are tight and responsive, if you mess up, it's your fault. Slap on the adorable art style, orchestral soundtrack, six different playable characters and suddenly Airscape: The Fall of Gravity is one of the best platformers to come out in 2015.(Thus far.)\nHowever one thing to keep in mind is that this game does cause quite a bit of motion sickness. It simply just spins and spins ALOT. If you are easily affected by visuals consider this a WARNING.\nIt's a fun, great game but the games core mechanics cause nausea.\n\nEDIT: So sadly, after the last patch my entire progress was reset. Not a huge problem but a little upsetting.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/sOOoxGiudFU\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","August 11, 2015","true","2.2"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","68","13","19","5","2"

There are 1 to 3 optional collectables per level, never too far from the main path. A handful of these collectables are time restricted and require you to speedrun the level with a not too strict time limit.\n\nSome movement quirks take a bit of practice to get used to, notably the way jumping out of water works (the incline of the water surface against gravity determines how much of your momentum you get to keep) and the fact that whenever gravity changes your controls also change instantly, before the camera can even catch up.\n\nThe difficulty curve is fairly smooth and the game isn't terribly difficult if you're used to the genre. For reference I'm (probably) the target audience for this kind of game and I beat it entirely in around 7 hours according to Steam. Actually challenging levels start to appear about 2/3 through when some enemies ripped straight from N+ show up.\n\nThere are a few mostly inconsequential bugs; if you die in water sometimes the music stays muffled when you respawn and fixes itself next time you jump out of water. The very last secret level also has plenty of visual glitches whenever you respawn which may or may not fix themselves when you progress to the next section of the level.\n\nOverall I'd recommend this game to people interested in the genre.","May 8","true","7.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The cute artstyle and peaceful music overlook a game that's actually reasonably difficult at its core. Variety is the name of the game here and levels don't repeat mechanics very often or reuse it in new and various ways, and you won't get bored with any specific mechanic or different character that you unlock. The game has some design issues in particular with the aesthetic and setting up the player for failure with some of its level design and the wrong use of color in certain action situations. It's going to wear on certain players of the genre, and there's nothing horribly unique about the game to make it stand out, but it's definitely solid in most aspects, and I did have fun even if I kept on dying at parts repeatedly. Also, be weary if you get motion sick. Even though there's options to deal with that in game, I do think it brings a worse experience in the end.\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nStrong variety in mechanics, as you'll be challenged by different platforming elements that don't twist the game into a pretzel, but do enough to make the game feel different from zone to zone.\nLike the different play styles and taking advantage of the different small differences in each of the characters.\nMusic is a strong relaxing soundtrack with appropriate action sections that give a feeling like Super Mario Galaxy's music would. Very appropriate to the gameplay.\nCute artwork, definitely get attached to the different octopi due to the artstyle and child like nature.\nWill provide a challenge for those who want it.\n-:\nSome of the level design goes against good platforming conventions with ideas of forced deaths (having to learn of vital information with a forced death). Can lead to frustration.\nNot really sure of the rotation camera mechanic and why it's so changeable in the end. Higher resolution of camera movement would have made a lot more sense.\nIt's in a crowded field right now, and honestly it doesn't do anything really strongly to stand out in any one area, which can be a problem. It's mostly solid: but that doesn't necessarily bode well with the competition it's against.\nInconsistent in the challenge curve. Fluxates strongly in several areas, as opposed to a reasonable progression.","August 11, 2015","true","5.1"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","11","20","2","0"

It started out as a strong, fun platformer that reminded me of Super Mario Galaxy. Then it turned into a game that was even more frustrating than Squirreltopia for me. I regularly play "hardcore indie platform" games, but the later levels were just beyond frustrating for a few reasons. First, it would be simple platform parts for about the first 40 seconds of the level, then after doing that 40 seconds of precision, but simple platforming, you get to the actual 'hard' platforming which ammounts to several environmental affects/enemies happening at once or an offscreen kill. Then the game ceased to be fun. Overall, great concept and execution, but lacking a bit in making levels fun, fair, and still challenging. Green squid levels are the worst since they literally drag on and on. I eventually just beat them all with purple.

Here's a link to the video review, followed by the text if you prefer reading it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ndxykC48ROY\n\nIntroduction\nAirscape: The Fall of gravity is a platformer in a similar vein to games like Super Meat Boy.  The release date is August 11th 2015 on Steam with the primary platform being PC, but the dev has confirmed that release day Linux support is planned.  They also specified Mac support as well for August, but I haven’t seen anything else confirming it directly as yet.\n\nWhile the game doesn’t have the same degree of cartoonish gore as Super meat Boy, a number of the game mechanics will feel somewhat familiar.  The unique element that it brings to the table is game area rotation with a heavy focus on gravity to solve the various levels.\n\nYou are an Octopus who’s friends have been kidnapped by mysterious mechanical beings.  And it is your task to navigate levels, rescuing critters while avoiding deadly traps and mastering gravity.\n\nControls and Performance\nAirscape feels good to play from a control perspective.  The character movements are very responsive whether you’re using the keyboard or a controller.  By and large, the control options are fairly simplistic which adds to overall aesthetic\n\nAs far as performance goes, the obvious intent behind Airscape is to maintain a crisp 60 frames per second.  It switches resolutions on the fly without reloading the graphics like most games require, likely a feature of its’ HTML5 base.  Further to that, it has an option to downscale graphical quality on the fly in order to maintain a high framerate which is incredibly important to platformers, especially ones of this kind where precise movements are the difference between success and failure.\n\nNormally, rotational motion is a huge problem in games because of people prone to motion sickness.  The devs included a very simple option to let you choose precisely how fast the screen rotates, as well as controlling screen shake which handles the motion sickness problem handily.  Turning the rotation down too slow, can impact how well you can play as the game is obviously intended to be played unadjusted, but that is a relatively minor gripe.\n\nDifficulty\nAirscape can be very hard, perhaps unless you’re a platforming master.  You will run into sections and levels that cause frustration but the beauty of the difficulty curve is that it is manageable.  A level is difficult for a while, until you master the movements to make it through.  And the devs did a good job of changing up the variety so that no two levels seem to have quite the same failure point.  I found that I never ran into a brick wall, two levels in a row which is clever forward thinking design.\n\nGraphical Quality\nWhen choosing to go with a stylized aesthetic as Cross-Product did, you can get away with some things graphically speaking that would otherwise be a problem.  It is not an amazing looking game by any stretch.  The color palette is very bright, the characters very cute.  I did feel that some more personality could have been added to your metallic opponents though.  The world is very style heavy, but a number of the obstacle types are lackluster by comparison.\n\nThere is a fair amount of attention to detail though in minor animation on the level.  Everything from background animation and skyboxes down to trees and bushes swaying when you move past them.\n\nUltimately, the graphical presentation isn’t harmed in any way by the simple aesthetic.  It is a game that should age very well.\n\nQuality Assurance\nI have very few concerns on the quality assurance side of the coin.  Airscape is a very simplistic game in its’ overall design, which leads to fewer bugs and Cross-Product has delivered a solid game that I didn’t experience any major issues or crashes.  The only bug related problems that I encountered in my playthrough were related to music overlaps where the music would occasionally not terminate when exiting a level, causing multiple tracks to be played over top of one another simultaneously.  This is a frustrating problem that does require reloading the game to fix, but it also wasn’t something that happened all the time, so in the grand scheme of things is relatively minor.\n\nSummary\nAirscape: The Fall Of Gravity is a clever platformer with game mechanics that are fairly uncommon.  I can’t say that they are entirely brand new ideas, but put together in a cohesive, if ridiculous and cute package that is satisfying from start to finish.  You will die, you will get stuck, you might even walk away ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, only to return an hour later and smash that tricky level to dust.\n\nThe performance and control scheme is spot on, the game looks good and is a ton of fun to play.  People who get hit harder by motion sickness may want to avoid it, or at least try out the demo first before committing to a purchase.\n\nAll in all, it is a very solid game with few problems.  If you’re a fan of platformers, then this title is right down your alley and is definitely worth your time.  It does what it sets out to do very well.\n\nRating\n9 out of 10.\n","August 11, 2015","true","8.1"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Levels have a lot of gravity based puzzles. You can jump from floor to ceiling, and rotate around small bits of land. It's pretty fun, especially in later levels when gravity is also used in traps and enemies.\n\nTo unlock the next chapter, you have to save "critters" within each level. Most are just hidden collectibles, but occasionally you will have a timer that starts when you begin a level, in order to save them. It's not hard to collect enough, and if you feel frustrated with collecting some, you can simply complete the level without saving any critters, or skip to the next level.\n\nAs you play the game, you'll save some octopus friends with different new abilities, which adds further freshness to the game.\n\nIt's a very simple game, with easy to understand mechanics, although levels later on do provide a challenge for people looking for something a bit harder. It's a great game overall!","August 11, 2015","true","2.8"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","0"

Other octopuses with unique abilities are unlocked as players complete zones. My favorite is the blue one, which can teleport small distances instead of dashing. Each zone is broken into about three or four levels with a few exceptions. These zones are made of stylistically themed floating platforms and waterways and each introduces a new kind of danger or platforming element. Some zones introduce stretches of acid players must swim through before it kills them, snipers that instakill if the player stops moving, roving robots that follow the player along the ground, and later levels will combine these elements.\n\n\nFinal Score: 8/10 - Great "While not the most original platformer, Airscape: The Fall of Gravity mixes many elements into a challenging and nerve-wracking platformer that anyone can enjoy."\n\nRead the full review: [http://techraptor.net/content/airscape-fall-gravity-review]","August 15, 2015","true","5.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game has some great level design and does a good job utilizing the different mechanics added throughout the game. The game is also quite long which includes 60+ levels (at the time of this review I have not finished the entire game). I expect the game will take around ten hours to complete unless you are really good at platformers.\n\nAt the beginning of the game I would consider Airscape to be moderately difficult. Around the midway point the game gets considerably harder and some of the levels are kind of frustrating. If you like harder platformers I think you will really enjoy Airscape: The Fall of Gravity.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of the game but received no other compensation for this review.\n\nRead My Full Review[www.geekyhobbies.com]","August 17, 2015","true","6.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game has a demo on Steam that is fun to play. It has simple but lovely graphics and a very easy set of game mechanics coupled to some fairly interesting physics and a decent control system. All these things point to the game being pretty damned cool and it is, right until it is not.\n\nAt first glance Airscape: The Fall of Gravity may well remind you of a classic platformer on a Nintendo system called Super Mario Galaxy but in a colourful 2D. You jump around as various sea creatures from small islands or floating water globules spinning the screen, swimming fast or slow as you collect other various sea creatures who bounce along merrily behind you until you find a portal that sets them free. Between yourself and these lovable creatures are various traps, bombs, squid bashing robots, lasers and… well, everything really! It feels extremely smooth, very controllable and generally lovely to play.\n\nIf you have been lucky enough to boot up the free demo (is there any other kind?) you will likely come away quite happy thinking that, yes, this is a game you could buy and enjoy once it is released. The problem lies in after you have purchased the full game at whatever undisclosed price it shall be. Hopefully just before you do you will manage to read this or other reviews that are allowed to be read a whole one day before the game goes on global sale because what you see in the demo is essentially it but with harder levels, harder puzzles that sometimes become frustrating in some areas and no real reward bar some small progression and possibly a chance to punch yourself in the arm proudly.\n\nDo not get me wrong, if you enjoy the kind of puzzle game you often find on your mobile device and if this games full release price is around five US Dollars then you could still walk away with a feeling of satisfaction however if you expect an actual in-depth PC game then you may well be best looking elsewhere because whilst the levels do vary in looks they do not vary much in the overall experience and this is why, based purely on assumption and forty years of gaming, I think this game had a review and stream embargo. I am quite sure the publishers and PR people will claim it is so as not to spoil the surprise of later levels or the bosses you get to fight but in reality I think we as gamers know that it is to avoid anyone saying “Is that it?” before buying it.","September 9, 2015","false","0.9"," 11 of 37 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","11","37","0","2"
