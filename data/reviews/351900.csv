I went in hopeful for at the very least, a polished game.\nWhat I recieved instead, was a heavy handed graphic novel with very little choice, broken english and many, MANY typos.\n\nI understand that I am likely not the main demographic this "game" was designed for, but I can not in good conscience advise ANYONE to experience this.\n\nAt one point two different pianos pieces were playing at once, causing a cacophany of noise, that I can only assume was a glitch, in any case it completely broke immersion.\n\nAnother problem with this "game" is that you have no real control over anything. Your choices feel skin deep at best, and dont appear to have any real clear effect on the events of the story.\n\nThe "game" also, repeatedly insults the "player". Calling the person "playing" the game various names and insults.\n\nAll I can wonder if why anyone would want to play a game about pregnancy at all? There is no gameplay to speak of, the main character is very simply written and difficult to identify with, there are numerous typos and it is very clear the creator did not spend much time polishing this "game".\n\nI dont think even an actual 14 year old girl would find much luck trying to identify or learn anything from this game.","March 2, 2015","false","0.5"," 594 of 636 people (93%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","93","594","636","26","5"

That was a game which presented me actual emotion, empathy and an insight to the human condition. I was expecting a similar experience with this game. Sadly, such wasn't the end result.\n\nPregnancy is supposed to be a mini game where we take the role of the voice within 14 year of Lilla Sandor's head. Not to present any huge spoilers, but she is recently ♥♥♥♥♥ and getting psychiatric help to overcome the trauma... until she discovers that she is pregnant. Thus, the title of the game. That is the exact moment you are introduced to Lilla's tale. You take a peek on her perception and give advice to the girl. There is no explanation whatsoever for your presence within her mind. She is in need of aid and you are there, yet I've completed the game twice and I'm positive that your influence over the girl's choice is nonexistent. Whatever you'd tell her, she'll end up doing the opposite anyway. So this is not a game: this is a botched infomercial.\n\nThe "game" tried to deal with an issue which is very real and grave, thus it is expected for it not to be conservative. What bothers me is that neither dialogues, nor events taking place within Lilla's life seem deep or real enough. Characters are immensely shallow - their perception exists in one liner responses - and dialogues are horribly superficial. I doubt that any 14 year old who is traumatized this much would ask the voice within her head whether she/he likes Hunger Games or not, and keep living her everyday life. Concepts deep and fundamental such as religion, society and sexuality are vaguely mentioned without giving any actual thought to their presence. Even with its best intention, the game doesn't go far off from being a lame power-point presentation with some piano music in the background.\n\nFor a game which discusses the nature of choice, you don't have any choice at all. She ends up either raising the child or having an abortion. Adoption isn't even considered as an option. The whole issue takes place within a 2 day period: she learns, she hides for a day, she blurts to certain people and she cries. Then she listens to REM's Everybody Hurts - a good song actually, one good reference within this game - and suddenly knows what to do with the child! It is ridiculous! A 14 year old getting ♥♥♥♥♥ and getting pregnant is not nature taking its course. It is a trauma and it has to contain the gravity of choice. This game, sadly, is a mockery on the concept.\n\nIf you'd like a better perception, watch Juno. If you'd like to be moved, play Cahors Sunset. Leave this abomination for poor reviewers like me. I lost some money on this... I suggest you don't.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","August 12, 2015","false","0.7"," 118 of 131 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","118","131","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadwitchwalking/recommended/351900/","deadwitchwalking","DeadWitchWalking","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadwitchwalking/","583 products in account","I truly wish I could recommend this game because I think games like Pregnancy are incredibly important for our medium to grow but unfortunately I can't. With every click you make it becomes obvious that the story was not written by someone who experienced anything of the sort of emotional trauma Pregnancy wants to present to you and doesn't understand it. I'd even doubt the developers talked to women who'd been in this situation (or even teenage girls in general) and had to make a choice like this. Pregnancy is superficial and cliché ridden and falls emotionally flat on every account.\n\nThat ia s a big problem because there's not much else Pregnancy has in store. It's a basic visual novel or piece of interactive fiction (whatever you prefer to call it) with simple graphics and several choices that don't feel meaningful. Locomotivah tried to change that with the very last choice you make and the following result, which was a nice idea, but the execution again falls flat because of the writing. All in all Pregnancy goes agains the most basic rule of storytelling: Show, don't tell.\n\nIt saddens me to write this but in the end, I have to review what Pregnancy is and not what I wish it was. I wish it was a well written, emotional experience but it's far from it. Instead it's at best a redundant experience and at worst something that could potentially hurt better games that try to go a similar route as serious experiences like this have a hard time as it is and Pregnancy proves many critics right with all the things it does wrong.","March 6, 2015","false","1.3"," 125 of 143 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","125","143","4","17"

Again, though, it’s an idea that never reaches fruition due to the title’s brevity, and all the interesting quirks about being your own person talking to a girl in crisis seems like it could have been better spent, you know, learning about the girl in crisis.

The storyline is good. But, it is skimpy. The stats presented at the end are bugged and claim that 100% of all gamers made each of the choices, which is of course impossible. But, the biggest problem with the game, IMHO, is that the reader is not given a chance to make any choices that effect the outcome in the end. This is not a good idea for a video game. Gamers want to work towards a desired outcome in choice games.\nI would suggest creating multiple endings for this story, in which the gamer could make real life-changing choices, and aim for targeted endings. This would reflect the fact that regardless of your idealogy in the life/abortion debate, you are a human being who is capable of thinking, making good choices, and directing the course of your own life. As is, I feel powerless. I feel used in the discussion, as my input was without effect in any manner. You asked for my choices after all, and you did not even take them into account in the ending to this choiceless story.\nIt is with reservation that I have to not recommend this game, since I would see it as a waste of the half hour I played the whole game. But, if the story were expanded, and multiple endings were made available, and the bugs in the ending stats provided actual data, then I would love to come back and edit my review to be a recommendation.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ExcitingJeff/recommended/351900/","ExcitingJeff","Exciting Jeff","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ExcitingJeff/","1104 products in account","One important thing to note is that this is really a game about ♥♥♥♥ as much as it is about pregnancy. It's a short game, and a fair portion of it is a fairly long (written) ♥♥♥♥ scene.  So there's that.\n\nI think I'm the target audience for this game, as I don't use "SJW" or "walking simulator" in conversation. Still, the game falls a little short of what I was hoping for.\n\nObviously, this game tries to be thoughtful. The writing, while not fantastic, is at least mechanically sound, and much better than many games developed in Europe. But the characterizations are shallow, and often unbelievable. I don't know how things work in Hungary, but I have a hard time believing that any psychologist would respond to a tearful revelation of ♥♥♥♥ and ensuing pregnancy with "Well, that's our last session. Send your family my love, and let me know if you need anything." Likewise, the cousin character is quite flippant about ♥♥♥♥ and teenage pregnancy.\n\nWhile I appreciate that the game tries to present a serious issue with the gravity it deserves, its short length does the topic a disservice. If a developer is going to deal with a complex emotional situation, it would be do well to convey the complexity and the emotionality in depth. A cursory treatment serves no one.\n\nThe ending is not going to satisfy anyone, by design. But I think its facile presentation of information undermines what little value the game has. Ultimately, the only thesis that the game offers is that pregnancy and ♥♥♥♥ are complicated and difficult to deal with. The problem is that anyone willing to pay the two bucks to play this game already knows that, and probably expects at least a modicum of insight.","July 9, 2015","false","0.3"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","24","28","2","1"

Interesting for a few moments, but   soon forgotten.  I very much doubt i'll ever boot up the game again after  spending a good hour  playing this through  a few times.  Being a male it did make me ponder on the subject of ♥♥♥♥ and the consequences that  are put onto the  ♥♥♥♥ victim.  My own sister went through an abortion after being ♥♥♥♥♥ and  what was   aweful, my father calling her some aweful names. I've never forgotten  what he said and  to be honest have never forgiven him for  making my sister feel like dirt.\n\nFor the measly price of £1.59 I'm not going to not recommend this to  the community.  But I would say wait until it goes on sale as  it'll be available for pennies, and then  it may be worth  getting just to  experience the choices  made by the  girl  through your influence and   for   the  male population, it may make you  think and even prevent some jerks from commiting  such crimes.\n\nYou can plow through this experience in less than 10 minutes if you are a speed reader and don't ponder too long on the choices, or as  I have done spend a good hour  playing it    more than once  to see the outcomes  from making different choices.  Whichever you   choose, you won't really see much apart from the  statistics already mentioned above.\n\n\nI really don't think this belongs here on Steam. It's not really  a game, but more like an interactive  information  bulletin  that  gives the reader  the ability to  make some  important choices    after being ♥♥♥♥♥ by a stranger.  It would be more appropriately   viewed via a DVD  given to  ♥♥♥♥ victims to  give them some  clarity about   the choices they  may have to face over the coming months of the pregnancy.  As mentioned above, it certainly  brought back some  sad memories for me and did make me think briefly about  the consequences of  ♥♥♥♥, not just the effect on the girl, but the  impact on  family and   the child if the pregnany was allowed to  go full term.","March 8, 2015","true","3.5"," 53 of 92 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","53","92","6","3"

The choices you make affect the outcome of the game slightly and with a twist. But the mechanics are not much more: You have still images and choose text options.\n\n2)	Is it worth it?\nIt lasts for 10-20 minutes, relies completely on short text messages and is about some serious issues. It is no fun. Not at all. It doesn’t want to be it and it would be wrong, if it were fun. So decide yourself.\n\n3)	Two guys write about the problems of a pregnant, ♥♥♥♥♥, 14 year old girl? Seriously?\nWell, yes. And especially the girls sounds sometimes strangely off, when the devs don’t seem to find the right register of a 14 years old girl. But then again, is it really important that it has been developed by men? It might be, surely, but in this case, I think they made some decent job.\n\n4)	So, this game is just pushing some feminist pro-choice agenda?\nNo. Definitely not. There can’t be said much more than that. “Pregnancy” is much more descriptive than advising or even proscriptive. That said it is important to note, that maybe the neutrality the game tries to provide is to blame for the relative superficiality of the end product. It doesn’t goe deep in pro and contra arguments. It is not analysing or arguing on an abstract level. It tries much more to put you right into the mind of this girl and forces you to look through her eyes, which are still the eyes of an half child. Keep that in mind if you think, the game is somehow stupid or the characters unrealistic.\n\nAnd at the end there is also something, the game reminds you. You can’t control the situation. That is something, a lot of games, even those with very serious subjects fool you about. You can advise, you can try to influence. But you are not the person in control. And it is not your job to be so.\n","June 12, 2015","true","0.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You are playing as a 14 year old woman who gets pregnant.\n\nI was expecting something a bit more "Cheerful" and maybe seeing some boobs or two. But sadly, this game left me wanting more.\n\nAnd by wanting more, I wanted less. This was the strangest game I have ever spent my money on, and I really wish I would have bought Sakura Spirit instead. At least in that game you have a chance to get laid.\n\nI felt very awkward playing this game, as well as the girl had a great quote saying at one point "I like the smell of potatoes."\n\nNow, as someone who lives in the midwest of the Americas, I too greatly enjoy potatos. But sadly,  I do not enjoy pregnant women.\n\nSo, I would say, unless you are a strange person who enjoys learing about the inner diaolog of a pregnant young teen, do not buy this game.\n\nIf you are a young teen, who is also pregnant, this game will also not do ♥♥♥♥ for you. Spend your 2 dollars on something more worthwhile.\n","March 6, 2015","false","0.3"," 20 of 41 people (49%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","49","20","41","10","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/allansianadventurer/recommended/351900/","allansianadventurer","Mat ➖ allansianadventurer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/allansianadventurer/","2511 products in account","Pregnancy is a game about leading a character through a dark and terrible situation by making choices and watching how the different options affect the world. However, this game differentiates itself from all the others that might fall under the same description by putting the player into the role of a literal voice in the protagonist's head, rather than controlling them directly. This allows the player to converse with the character, discuss the different choices they encounter and become a character in their own right.\n\nThe ability of the protagonist to choose their own path despite the player's input is a core component of the game, giving them free reign to argue against decisions and question the player's motives and competency. The capacity exists to become friends or enemies with the main character and the relationship between the protagonist and the player is one I wish would have been explored more, had the game been longer.\n\nI played through once, which took twenty minutes. Me and Lilla, I think her name is, parted ways amicably and I never made a solid decision for her, but the game interpreted my choices as pro-choice, so it was weird when it felt like the game ended by saying "Haha, she did the opposite of what you told her, we tricked you!" Our conversations were always friendly and open and I never really told her to do anything. I did wish there were more dialogue options, sometimes, but I'm always happy to pay £1.59 for a unique, interesting experience that makes me think.","March 28, 2015","true","0.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Well the simple answer is no. It's worth 19.99. Unlike "Telltale", Locomotivah actually cares about not only it's products, but the general public. Making it a mere 1.99 friends can gift each other pregnancy by selling TF2 or CS:GO items on the market place. If you have not already, I highly recommend selling items on the market. Even if you already own a copy, pregnancy will always be a gift to cherish for a life time. Just ask my mom. Now to the game itself.\n\nGameplay\nThe only bad part about this game is I couldn't even get a glimpse at the man who penetrated my cIiterous. I am however able to play as a voice in the main character head. I sometimes wish that my head was in the main Character's head, not these stupid, tell her one of two options crap. This game does tell a story that I will remember for a long time. When ever my teacher points out Hungary on a map, I will remember that I played as a spirit in a pregnant teenage girl. Along with the humor of idolizing pop music from America, and loving JLAW for her acting and not the "Fappening", there's a serious tone on whether or not a 14 year old girl, should keep a baby, or abort it. No matter what side you choose the best friend will try to convince her otherwise. Luckily this was noted at the end of the game, because otherwise who knows what could be spewing on social media.\n\nOptions\nThe game gives you two options you can configure. One is a nice and dandy windowed mode, so you men can have chrome underlapping the game so if your parents come in they won't know you have Pregnancy.\nThere's also a music on/off option, but I recommend not, for the music is just erotic as it is beautiful.\n\nLength\nThis game, very short compared to a Telltale game, makes up for it in the replayability. It will rain when Locomotivah releases Pregnancy 2, making the entire fanbase wet.\n\nConclusion\nOut of all my games, Pregnancy was the first true hearted review I ever wrote. My final verdict is 0/31 birth control pills a month because I want pregnacy every day of the month.","April 2, 2015","true","61.8"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","40","6","15","9","1"

As the game progresses it becomes more and more engaging. The inner dialogue between the player and the character is brilliant. The entire game is an amazing piece of art. Unfortunately, it has one aspect that lets it down. The ending is the opposite of what a player decides. In theory, this is  fantastic idea as it represents how we are 'real life' pressures to girls in this situation. Our decision is not important, it is up to them. However, in practice this leads to a very anti-climatic ending with a 'fence-sitter' resolution.\nThe way this game could be improved is to change the reason for the inner dialogue. The person in her mind should have been the baby and, in the ending, she should have aborted it. This means she would be killing the player, only to realize that the voice in her head was her own child.","March 9, 2015","true","2.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

It makes sense, even if the grammar is bad. It's good that they put resources at the end of it for people on either side of the fence.\n\nBut...\n\nYeah, but this is taking a stab at controversy, period. I guess it's supposed to be thought provoking, but it's really not. I DID go into this without any expectation, but I expected a little bit more than broken English and a very oversimplified system here. A schizophrenic girl gets pregnant via sexual assault, and you're supposed to give her advice and guide her. At the end, you get the result that's exactly opposite of what the slideshow thinks you're trying to imply.\n\nRealism? No, this isn't realistic.\n\nIt's trying really hard to be, but all the decisions you make are black and white, and the creator seems far more concerned with pushing their playlist, rather than presenting thought-provoking points. Still, it's a good attempt to relate a very crappy situation which happens, albeit rarely. It DOES happen.\n\nThe optimism?\n\nThis slideshow is far, far too optimistic in any manner of play through. Period. Things are not this simple. They aren't, and this takes the complexity out of a horrifying situation almost altogether.\n\nNote to the author:\n\nGood try, I recommend this, but you're obviously stabbing at controversy. I appreciate what you're trying to convey, but you vastly oversimplify the situation.\n\nEven still, thanks.","May 24, 2015","true","0.3"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/recommended/351900/","tgr1","Kelly Osbourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/","436 products in account","Pregnancy, an interactive drama by developer Locomotivah, puts the player in a position of power and trust. You play as a young girl’s conscience and guide her through the myriad of emotions she is feeling. The “game’s” protagonist, Lilla, is only 14, she likes make-up, music and boys, but she’s hiding a secret.\n\nLilla was ♥♥♥♥♥ by an older, drunken man and has fallen pregnant. This realisation has triggered something within her; a voice inside her head that can help her make sense of the situation. You’ll play as Lilla’s conscience and be a voice of reason amidst the uncertainty. Whenever she has a choice to make you can help point her in the direction of your choosing. She needs to decide whether or not to tell her family, friends and psychologist that she is pregnant, and you will be instrumental in shaping those decisions.\n\nDialogue switches between Lilla’s conversations with her conscience, her family, and herself. At various points the player will get to chime in and give their opinions by choosing from a number of pre-selected options. Whether it’s making fun of Lilla’s taste in music, or helping her choose between life or abortion for her potential child, you will be there with her\n\nPregnancy‘s dialogue can, at times, be touching, and portrays strongly the uncertainty and pain that a young girl in such a horrible situation may feel. Locomotivah clearly have a knack for creating believable and likable characters. No matter which path you choose to guide Lilla down, it will be because you think it is best for her and her family.\n\nThe dialogue isn’t perfect though. It is quite clear that Pregnancy wasn’t scripted by a native English speaker, and we often found ourselves re-reading certain slides to gain clarity on what the writer actually meant. The writing can also come off as a little trite, and perhaps childish, even for a 14-year-old. Although these issues are a little jarring they don’t detract too much from what is otherwise an immersive interactive drama.\n\nPregnancy is brief, at around 20 minutes long, but it asks some very difficult questions in that short runtime, and as a (reasonably) young man I have never had to think about some of the issues posed by it. Giving birth to a baby conceived through ♥♥♥♥ or having an abortion could both be life-altering events, that could not only damage the physical but the psychological as well. So it’s worth taking pause for a moment to think how it would feel to be in such a situation.\n\nAfter the closing credits have rolled you are given a run-down of the various paths you guided Lilla down, as well as a percentage split that portrays the decisions made by other people. If you weren’t already sure of which side of the fence you fell on, Pregnancy shows whether you made more pro-life or pro-choice decisions. Somewhat confusingly, Lilla’s ultimate decision will be the direct opposite of the options you have chosen though, making your interaction feel like it didn’t have much of an impact.\n\nPregnancy is uncomfortable to “play”, but that’s a good thing. As gamers, we are, more often than not, taking part in a fantasy, rather than being grounded in reality. Despite some dialogue issues and a seeming lack of impact from your choices, we must applaud Locomotivah’s efforts. Lilla’s story is approached with respect and sensitivity, and while it certainly isn’t going to change any preconceived ideas you may have about abortion it might prompt you to explore why you feel the way that you do.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPromotional copy provided by developer.

I thank him a lot because I was really looking forward to this game.\n\nI think the developers did a great job on this game, you can see that they've put a lot of work into it.\n\nThe singleplayer was good, I really like the adult parts in the story, they were so detailed!\nThis story inspired me to be like that criminal. I also want to give 14 year old drunk-on-vodka Hungarian girls this experience. It truly is a once in a lifetime game. I really don't understand how the developers put it up on steam for only €2,- ...  I would definitely estimate the value of this game around €100,-.\n\nOne thing I didn't like is how stuck-up this Hungarian lady-swine was. I mean she could also just ♥♥♥♥ing jump belly-first from a staircase and then her f*cking problem was solved but nonono.... She had to be all childish and cry-baby about it, grow a pair of f*cking balls b*tch.\n\nAlso the story was kind of unrealistic, it said the 14 year old girl was the prettiest of her class...\nWe all know that in Eastern Europe all women are fat-sweaty-hairy-mustache bearing-ladymen... But then again   she was the 'prettiest' of her class.   (don't wanna know what those other Russians look like)\n\nSPOILER ALERT:\nIn the end you find out that the criminal was actually Vladimir Putin, the fetus in the womb was Adolf Hitler and the girl was Angela Merkel. So yeah it was kind of unrealistic because we know that Vladimir Putin would never do that to a girl older than 2 years...\n\nHowever the game covers the current situation in the world pretty well. Hungary is led by Kim Jong Un while the Third-Reich and the Soviet Union are forcing up against the US because Barack Bin Laden bombed Moskou, I like how they used that realistic aspect in the game.\n\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention the genre of the game...\nUnlike the genre mentioned on steam (horror, fps). I'd put this in a h3nt4i category because of the Japanese culture references. Also I would say it is a very good simulation game, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is nothing compared to this one imho.\n\nTL:DR\nThis game made me bust all over myself.\nWas kind of unrealistic though\nBut inspired me a lot\nAmazing plot\n\n\nReally fun to watch all by yourself, make sure to buy some lube though\n\n\nI rate this game: 8/8","March 2, 2015","true","0.1"," 29 of 95 people (31%) found this review helpful 46 people found this review funny","31","29","95","46","8"

On the other hand, the dialogue has multiple typos along with being on 20 mins long. For what it tries to do (spread the message about how ♥♥♥♥ deeply effects the victim and how hard this decision is to make) it shows that it can tell a short story quite well, if poorly written at times. Its one giant downside is its reception to the player, making it frustrating to play through with just how the game treats you. The player is repeatedly called an annoyance and is literally forced out of the game without any decisions having any impact (she does the opposite of what you recommend, its as stupid as it sounds).\nWhile the game itself is lacklustre and short, its message is defined as almost a joke as to how little can be done to influence someone with this situation. One huge problem is how well it is written at times, dragging the player in and kicking you out without any warning, seeming like it will build up to a huge climax only to have a deus ex machine come out of nowhere. This had the potential to be a truly heart-breaking experience, but felt rushed towards the end.\nI would love to recommend this game, but I can't because of the way this was rushed. It had so much potential only to squander it in one fell swoop. Maybe if there is a sequel soon then my opinion may change but for now, its just a small timewaster.","March 2, 2015","true","0.3"," 10 of 50 people (20%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","20","10","50","2","0"

It does a good job at making you feel empathy for the 14 year old girl inside the story.  It completely opened my eyes as an adult to a whole new perspective that such a young woman might have.  - And for that alone, I feel that I got my money's worth.\n\nThe game has pretty good music,  you'll need to read yourself (there is no voice acting in the game), and the ending is based on the choices you make and what you say to the girl.  (You are talking to her in her head through the game.)\n\nThere is no animated graphics, just repeated photos of the people talking in the story.\n\nThere are no puzzles, no deep game mechanics, but I could see this game hitting someone or someone close to a woman in the same situation pretty hard.\n\nI enjoyed it, even as an adult male.  For that, it gets my two thumbs up.  Certainly not for everyone though.\n\nPeople who scoff at a game like this are likely the very same people who whine and complain about the lack of variety in game choices today and that every game is a copy of something else.

It handeld the subject matter very well. It concentrated on the main character more than it did the ♥♥♥♥ itself. This made me actualy feel for the main character much more than I did for any bland woman in a ♥♥♥♥ revenge film.\n\nBut I do have a few knit picks.\n\nFirstly why is one of the tags Survival Horror?I don't remember needing to gather suplies or conserve ammo. There was no way I could not survive so calling the game survival horror is a bit wrong.\n\nAlso I did'nt like the way you as a charater were in the game. In the game you talk to the main character within her own head. I would have been fine with this but it is done in a very 4th wall breaking way. At one point your name is asked and   when you give it you are called by your real name for the rest of the game. I understand that this is done so you can bond with the main character which is vital for the game but I do wish it was handeld better so to not hurt my immersion.\n\nAnd my last knit pick is that wikipedia is given to us as reading material.

The concept are interesting, this is probably the only novel/game that tackles this issue that I've heard off. Despite the length of the game (I played through the game twice in less than 50 minutes.) it delivers few points, although there's a lot of fillers in the novel. The choices you make impacts the story, the outcome and the end of the story. However, throughout the whole story it feels like there's insidious advertising with it constant referencing pop culture, movie series and apple products. The story is rather shallow with little content. Due to the shortness we don't get to know the characters and don't feel like there's a gain or loss whatever the outcome will be. The story seem rushed through, and the developers have done a poorly job to set themselves in Lillas shoes for making the story vivid. The full price are kind of high for this one. I'm kind of torn whether I should recommend this game or not, but I give it a thumbs up since it's a interesting concept, but they could have done much more about it. The game's just okay, I wouldn't buy it unless it's on sale.","April 18, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
