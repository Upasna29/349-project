Like most adventure games of this type it is devilishly tricky.\n\nFeels like a (silent) David Lynch movie crossed with Fallout, minus the ultraviolence. It has an innocent charm, but a sinister undercurrent, so I'm not yet sure if I should let my kids play it.","June 2","true","4.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The format lends itself really well to having the "silent movie" type cards -- which I thought I'd find jarring when watching the trailer, but didn't. The videos the projector displays made me laugh out loud (literally out loud, which is very uncommon for game jokes as they usually only make me smile) and with the third movie I found it quite funny to get some foreshadowing of what the twist would be from the last frame visible during the assembly.\n\nOther things I liked:\nHow you made the most out of having just a few locations -- having to go back to earlier screens\nObjects being used, sensibly, multiple times\nThe surrealism and bleakness of the wonderfully drawn world. Things like the crashed car being there long enough to rust and the general state of disrepair in the world contrasted nicely with the playing children. The projector even seems to clean it up slightly as he goes along, which I interpreted as symbolic of his good intentions.\nThe music. Simple, but appropriate.\nLogical puzzles -- I'm hardly a very good player, but I finished it in about 45-50 minutes\nThe projector looking dejected simply by facing downward in the last act\nThe ending it seems appropriately sadI got the feeling there are multiple endings(, possibly a more cheerful one), especially as I only got 4 out of 6 achievements, but I haven't been able to find them.\n\nIs the area behind the red double doors the prison? It is the only place that cannot be reached from the outside and my instincts were to take the photo there at the end.\n","June 2","true","1.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While I did get it to review for free, I definitely enjoyed it.  And I think it's a great example of doing something rather unique with the hidden object genre games.   The one aspect that people might notice are the sticky animations.   I was told this was from the rather limited budget this game was created with.   For what they had, I think they did a very good job indeed.","June 6","true","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not super original though, since it immediately reminded me of Saga of course.\n\nThe biggest thing I would critique is how long it takes to find items or complete an objective. The most frustrating part is that nothing stands out or is highlighted, so you have to click on everything you see until something happens. I almost lost interest several times. Also, the objectives aren't laid out, so sometimes it's confusing as to what you have to do.\n\nA suggestion may be to add more dialogue and hints when you click items, instead of having him just shrug and shake his head. Just like they would in Silent Hilll or something.\n\nOveralll the game itself if interesting enough to grab my attention but if it takes me too long to find an object I'm going to quit out of frustration.\n\nI lost my marbles at the "A Trip to the Moon" reference.
