This is their first game so don't expect triple A graphics like Battlefield 4. However graphics are only 1 point of a video game. This is also not the 'full game'. Its a mini game for those of you who are waiting on the story driven part. This is more like testing out the water before you jump in.\n\n\nFirst thoughts\n\nWell the game can be fun, however it has a long way to go. The textures seem bland'ish, but they work for a sturdy foundation, but will need some improvement. Think of the graphics as a mix between half-life 1 and Unreal tournament. The maps can be pretty fun, from multiple levels (1-5 stories high) to maps with 1-2 stories, however i noticed the game will start to stutter and drop fps if you look towards the middle of the map...or at least on 1 of the maps called 'Devils run".\n\nThe physics are quite funny, which i mean most of the time they work well, other times you fly off of an object and die, or by jumping on top of your teammate and some how die from taking damage. Fall damage is kind of borked since you can die from only falling around 2-3 feet.\n\nThe guns work well and sound decent, but atm the GL launcher is a bit broken since it only kills by direct damage, not splash. Other then that the guns work normal.\n\nThe gamemode is a mixture of capture the flag and control point. Well you capture a flag and you get a set amount of points. Then the flag will spawn at a random location. The team with the most points win. This is really fun to be honest.\n\nThe main menu.....hmm.....it needs so...urm a lot of work. You can't change controls atm, but they work well. Options, which are limited can only be changed in-game. You have to type your name in the 'player name' box. The game has no dedicated servers, its more like call of duty, one person hosts, then the rest dog pile in.\n\nWhen picking teams you press 'tab' not 'esc', this is thrown on the 'menu', a seperate menu would work better imo.\n\n\nFinal verdict for this...\n\nIt has bugs and optimization issues, but it feels like all those classic games back in the 90's. At the moment $15 might be too high, but I would pay around $7 easy. I think a better move for the devs would be to make it into early access instead of full release. They have a long way to go for improvement, but hey not too bad for your first attempt at making a game.\n\n\nI rate this as a mixed. Some parts are bad, others are good. With time, i'm sure it will improve greatly.\n","April 30, 2015","true","1.0"," 32 of 57 people (56%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","56","32","57","12","19"

I love the variety in maps to choose from and how pretty the maps look.  The game is able to run smoothly on my somewhat bad computer.  I also really enjoy the classic game feel, it really brings back memories of Doom and Goldeneye.  I can't wait to play more!","April 30, 2015","true","18.8"," 15 of 53 people (28%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","28","15","53","10","0"
