It is a multi-player game that claims to have a solo campaign. The solo campaign are challenges like an extended tutorial. So what is this game? A turn based strategy like a complex game of chess with a board where you either destroy crystals or the other players to win the match.\n\nWhy is multiplayer bad? Because it is turn based, you finish your turn and then wait for the other person to complete their turn. How long does that take? Could be one minute, or it could be hours or days. In fact there is an achievement if you take 24 hours to make a turn. There is even an achievement to take 24 hours! Rewarding someone for wasting someone else's time is not a good thing. To compensate for this, you can play a lot of games at once. Like chess via mail. I was so completely bored playing this game that I literally opened up another game to play it as I waited for people to perform their turns and get back to me.\n\nWhen you start a match, you select from one of your owned factions. You start with humans and TF2 factions when you own the game. Then if you want the other races like Elves, Dwarves, Shaolin and Tribes, its $5 each. Each faction has its own characters that play differently.","August 12, 2012","false","5.5"," 64 of 85 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","64","85","2","6"

It is NOT pay to win as another reviewer has written. Strategy is key to victory here, not cash.  If you think this game is pay to win then you obviously haven't put in the patience required to learn each team's strengths and weaknesses and adjust your strategy accordingly.  There are additional teams that one CAN purchase if they wish, it doesn't matter if you choose not to though, as all of the teams (although quite unique) are exceptionally well balanced.\n\nThe game can be a bit buggy.. eg. Sometimes you're greeted with a blank board and it's neccessary to refresh the game state before the pieces appear.  This is probably one of the unfortunate side effects of being a cross-platform game.  The strategy involved is on par with chess, perhaps not as rich as some players would like (It's no Magic The Gathering). Some people complain that players are not forced to move within a time limit. I happen to like this feature of the game as I can leave the game minimized while I am working and take my turn when I am ready.\n\nIn spite of it's minor short comings, Hero Academy succeeds in providing interesting and engaging turn-based strategy game play, which if you're a fan of such games you know there are far too few of them on the market.","November 26, 2013","true","918.8"," 64 of 89 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","64","89","0","0"

Back in 2013 when I first played, and immediately stopped playing until now, I've had games go for weeks without them doing their turn. I launched the game again today to see if they fixed that, and they haven't. My first match got someone who didn't even do his first turn.\n\nIn addition, you only have two teams to play as, and the others cost $5. They play differently, too, so that's not fair to anyone who doesn't want to spend like $50 on a bad game.\n\nYou just can't play this game. No singleplayer, and no multiplayer. It might be fun with friends, though, I guess.\n\nIf you want to play Hero Academy, but don't have a phone for the free version, or $5 for the PC version, just invite a friend to your house. Play chess for a bit, then just walk away. Or just walk away immediately. But don't ever say anything to your friend.","December 21, 2015","false","19.2"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","22","28","5","0"

It's just different from what I expected.\n\nWhen I bought this game I was expecting some cool things like missions, custom games, and multiplayer.  Heck, maybe a couple different game modes.  Instead, I opened the game and the first thing I get is a tutorial shoved in my face that explains everything I could have figured out in two seconds.  Then it gives me a multiplayer option and a customization option.  Of course, I want to see what I can customize.\n\nOriginally, you can change your avatar and not much else.  Everything else is DLC.  Actually, everything in GENERAL is DLC.  You want to change your team color? DLC!  You want to play the other three team options?  DLC!  You want to play the mission mode I was ever so hoping for?  DLC!  You want to play the other game modes?  Well there arent any other game modes but if there was that would probably be DLC as well.  So after I realize that I can't play mission mode, I sigh and try to play multiplayer.  Since I enjoy TF2 quite a bit, I decide to go with that team instead of the other one that I have.\n\nWell I start playing for like 30 minutes or so and I'm enjoying it.  There is a door at the bottom left with a turn number counting down.  I thought that was the amount of turns you had left before the game ended.  Nope.  It's how many turns you have left before you can surrender.  That's when I realize how LONG these games are.  They are like, really, really long.  Like, REALLY long.  Also, the learning curve is freaking gigantic.  90 minutes in I still don't know what in the heck half of my characters do.  And it seems like the teams you can buy are EXTREMELY overpowered.  I swarmed the guy with soldiers, demos a scout and a medic and in one turn one of his characters walked up and killed 3 of the 5.  It took me 3 turns to kill the character that did the deed.\n\nBut in the end, if you have the attention span of a goldfish like me and don't like having to buy DLC to get everything that the game promised I really don't recommend this.  Although if you like games like this, have patience and don't care about money, this game is for you.\n\nOh and one more thing: This game is an iPhone port and feels like an iPhone port.  Fair warning.\n\n","March 6, 2014","false","1.5"," 41 of 63 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","41","63","0","0"

I played a solid 10 hours on release and had a pretty good time battling with my friends.\n\nEven if you aren't playing with your friends, the internet multiplayer option allows for quick and seamless matchmaking, meaning you can play as and when you want.\n\nHowever, a few specificities of the game kind of ruin it. By default, the opening "move allowance" is set to be unfair against the person who creates the game, meaning that very very option (unless manually de-selected) your opponent (or you) will have a +3 or -3 move advantage, which very much affects the late stages of the game when every move counts.\n\nThis, for me, tilted the tables. I no longer felt I was playing a game, I felt I was inadvertantly cheating. Since then, I haven't played anymore.\n\nA good game, but tweaking required for it to be fair. But, if you tweak your settings, you need to rely on your opponent doing so as well (which, by the way, they wont).\n\nNilesy","November 30, 2012","true","9.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

One it's that it feels clunky and slow which is not what one should expect for a mobile game port to PC. Some friends and I have ran into some issues submiting turns. Also it's grossly overpriced compared to the mobile version in which you can get almost all of the same content for half the price. There's not really a single player, only a handful of challenges and the only good way to learn the game is playing online.

This case is different,Hero Acadmey is a simple turn based strategy game that relies heavily on your actions. You lose a game, thats your fault. The object of the game is form a small team and defeat the opposing team and/or destroy their crystal. Sounds fun huh? Yeah thats a load of BS. The game is ONLY Multi-player even though in the Steam Store, it says is single player. But thats not even the worst part, there are if im not mistaken, 6 clans you can choose from to fight with. The default heros, the TF2 group (SWEET!) and...... oh yeah the rest are FREAKING DLC! Wow, by making the rest of the clans dlc, you elminate 90% of the game. Each clan has unique charateristics which allows for a variety of battles encountered and when I say "variety", I truly mean that... in a very unfair way, every match I played online (which wasn't very much) did have variety...but my opponnet would have the DLC clans who seemed Over Powered. Credit to "Th^3 blurb" for having a better example of this, your amount of damage 3 members on the NON-DLC teams can do is how much 1 member of any DLC team can do in just one turn. Makes you want to play such beasts, but by making MORE THAN HALF THE CLANS DLC is the stupidest thing you could ever do. For those who want the Ninja Cowl so bad for the Spy in TF2, just go on a trading site, and just pay up 1.33 ref (usually lower since it makes the spy honestly look stupid and nothing remotely close to a ninja). And if you want the other cosmetics for the Scout, Pyro, and Demoman (not the best looking looking ones) , good luck trying to find one, but I doubt that because guess what, the cosemtics require you to buy MORE DLC! Or buy the game to be one step closser to leveling up that "games owned" badge but it will be a blemish to your library. BTW, this game costs $5. Now with the DLC's to make the game actually complete, it will cost you 25 bucks. This game is like an XBOX 360 game. You buy a game thats somewhat cheap, your having fun until you realize that theres more "FUN" (I use this word loosely) this game can offer you if you buy like a bijillion DLC for mediocore prices. For those solely for the TF2 items, you know there are better looking promo items that can be earned in a Free To Play game such as Super Monday Night Combat or AVA Alliance or CrimeCraft. Save your 5 (25) bucks for something better like Card City Nights, or X-COM. Better games for the same price (less) and didn't have backstabbing developers.","April 6, 2014","false","0.5"," 31 of 50 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","31","50","0","0"

When you can get this on the iOS for free? Aside from challenge mode which are really a small handful of puzzles, you can't play this game alone. You have to versus someone else with it. If you can find a friend you'd love to play or don't mind the "Find Opponent" button and all the downtime that comes with it between waiting turns and want the TF2 stuff, then by all means, go get it. There is no 'real' single player. Also, the DLC is essentially buying a new Faction of characters. All the locked content will cost you $15 dollars together. $5 + $15 = $20. That's a scary equation.

It's very solid and concise on the whole.\n\n* Options to Start games with your Steam friends, Twitter Friends/Followers and more are very useful and notifications of your game progress work well\n* Great looking assets and themes, though marketing these as DLC is going too far\n* Good Tutorial\n\nMistakesThere's a real problem with the time it can take to play a match, since the fast pace is sometimes half of the fun in Hero Academy. It plays like chess via traditional mail, in that you can wait hours or even days for your opponent to return a move (there's even an achievement to take 24 hours+ to take a turn), which isn't in itself a bad thing because it helps keep it casual enough that you can have 10+ games open at the same time and not have to worry about committing to each, but it would've been so simple to add options to set time-limits and game-closing options to enforce quicker games, which many people want from a game like this.\n\nThe DLC offers extra teams with avatars, and some include items for TF2 and while the extra content is fairly good, it's still a jarring way to use DLC for most people, especially when it affects people who are not willing to buy the DLC negatively, essentially creating a pay-to-win feel, albeit not entirely in your face.\n\n* Selling cosmetics and styling as DLC is fine, but selling teams which affect global gameplay leaves a sour taste for most\n* No options to play only faster paced games\n* Annoying Robot Entertainment DRM\n\nRecommendationsPriced at between £5.59/7.99€/$7.99 and £12.99/16.99€/$16.99 at the time of review. The nature of this game makes it one of the most replayable games around, and you'll likely continually find yourself coming back to old games.\n\nHowever, it's also available on iOS, and feels a lot more casual on there due to the more immediate nature of PC gamers. It's also much cheaper on mobile and so is probably the better option for many.\n\nThe DLC offers extra teams with avatars, and some include items for TF2. While the extra content is fairly good and adds a lot if you know your playstyle, it's still a jarring way to use DLC for most people, especially when it affects people who are not willing to buy the DLC negatively, essentially creating a pay-to-win feel.\nYou will probably never use some of the Teams, so if you've never played before, buy the base game only and find out which paid teams you like, if any.","May 28, 2015","true","3.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's telling that most of my time and enjoyment from the game came from the single player puzzle mode challenges.\n\nThis is not necessarily a bad game... but don't bother with it on PC.","December 3, 2013","false","23.9"," 27 of 50 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","27","50","0","0"

Supports cross-platform multiplayer so you can play from your PC against people using iPads or smartphones.  The (default) Council team is a great, all around team and when you add in the Steam exclusive TF2 team, you're set to give anyone a run for their money.  The pace is as fast or as slow as you want it to be; you can play multiple games against many different players or just focus soley on one game.  The additional teams add variety to strategy and gameplay and the challenge pack adds tons of single player puzzles with varying difficulties.  Hero Academy really does offer endless hours of play for very little upfront cost.  The Gold Pack is a great deal especially during a Steam sale.  You also get some TF2 hats that are team themed if you're into that sort of thing.","May 29, 2013","true","71.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The dev team for this game are money ♥♥♥♥♥s. This game is priced about right, don't get me wrong, but if you wanted to buy another 'team' it costs WAY more then you would imagine.

I hear complaints about slow games, because it was originally developed for mobile devices; but if you get passed that(and there are some steam groups for faster games), it's a blast. I just treat it like a slow moving game I come back to and every now and then you get a few good plays back to back before you or your opponent quit playing again.\n\nIt's like some weird version of chess that just comes out fun. I like the TF2 team exclusive to steam players too.\n\nThe price of the game is a little much IMO, especially as it's free to IOS users(with one team to play), the DLC is also over priced in my opinion, but I got this on sale for 0.99 and should've gotten the extra teams too, but I didn't(wasn't thinking and kinda broke). So if you find this on sale, I say get it.

I thought this would be a game of training up your heros and sending them on missions. Unfortunately, it's basically a simplified game of chess. And it's multiplayer only. So not only is there no character development, but you make a move and then wait twenty minutes for your oponent to make his. Oh, and this is a direct port of an iOS micro-transaction game. So while the game only costs five bucks, you only get the most basic squad, and you can't even change your squads color without buying a "DLC." ♥♥♥♥ing rubbish.\n\nTruth be told, the game's not awful. It's just sort of blah. There's very little to it, and all the above negatives.

It's a sort of an asychronous turn-based battle deck chess game. 6 different teams available (though you have to buy most of them: go for the Gold Pack), each with with their strengths and weaknesses. It's one of those easy to learn, difficult to master sort of games, with a lot of room for strategy and tactics. Sometimes luck can play a part with the way you and your opponent draw units and items into your hand, but it doesn't feel insurmountable to me. You can start as many games as you want, with friends or strangers, and you'll see a wide variety of skill levels.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/praisecheadle/recommended/209270/","praisecheadle","c5","http://steamcommunity.com/id/praisecheadle/","1138 products in account","A fun and addictive turn-based strategy game that is easy to learn, but takes some serious thinking to master. I particularly like that you can have several games going at once, which alleviates some of the tedium of waiting for your opponents to make a move (the challenge DLC also gives you something to do between turns). You should know that the asynchronous nature of the multiplayer means that it could be a full day or even longer before you see the other player's turn (think chess-by-email for comparison), so the actual games could take a while, but the nice thing about the design of the game is that you can play it in short bursts. I also really like that the multiplayer is cross platform against IOS and Android, so the game has a decently sized playerbase. What's even better is that all of your games and DLC transfer over, so a game you've started on PC can be continued on Android, for example. Another great thing is that at least some of the achievements seem to transfer over, as I won a game on android, then when I logged onto Steam, the achievement for winning a game unlocked. Also, the game has an icon in the system tray that alerts you that it is your turn if you leave the game running in the background, which is a fantastic idea. My only gripe is that there is no local multiplayer, as this game seemes like it would be well suited for that.","December 17, 2013","true","154.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's fairly simplistic but enjoyable.  It's online player verus player only, with no skirmish mode, and I hate that.  Buying it on steam gives you access to two teams, the humans and the Team Fortress 2 team, but there are three others.  Just pray you don't get matched against someone who's paid to unlock the dark elves, you'll lose.\n\nThat's part of the problem with the game, the racial abilities for some teams are radically overpowered.  Teamfortress2 team has the ability to gain an extra move every time they 'kill' a unit by stomping.  Since each round has 5 moves, adding a 6th is pretty huge.   But the dark elves ability to heal EVERY TIME THEY DO DAMAGE is ridiculously overpowered.  I have played over 30 games so far and I haven't been able to beat the dark elves even once.\n\nFor $5, if you like strategy games like this, it's definitly fun.  Maybe if you buy the 2 pack and play with a friend, it would be better.","August 27, 2012","true","164.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each player has a deck of units and abilites based on what race they choose, and 5 action points per turn.  Unit cards can be spawned onto one of two spots on the player's side of the map.  Abilities can be activated on anything that is eligible to recieve the effect.  The object is to destroy either the enemy team, or their two crystals which generally spawn fairly close to the unit spawn tiles.  Each race has different funtions, the Orcs seem to excell at causing large ammounts of damage with combat units but don't have many damaging ability cards, whereas the Team Fortress team relies on using support units to buff the damage dealing units.\n\nAll in all the base game at $5 is well worth it, the DLC expansion races seem a little high in price to me, but once they drop to 50% off I'll definitely be grabbing them.","August 11, 2012","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes a few times in a row.\n\nSometimes, after I make all my moves, I hit submit, and it tells me something like 'Failed to submit turn, please check your connection' (It's definitely not -my- connection). After this happens, no matter how many times I hit submit, it keeps returning the same error. If I click on another match, when I go back to the one with the error, about 1/2 of the time it makes me enter the move again, and sometimes still won't accept the turn submission.\n\nAnd sometimes, when I click on an existing match, the game board will be completely blank as if no one has started the game. If I don't recognize the name of the opponent, if I make my turn's moves and hit submit, it will return the error yet again. If I do recognize it, I know that I have to either go play another match, or restart the game.

Each player has a deck of units and abilites based on what race they choose, and 5 action points per turn.  Unit cards can be spawned onto one of two spots on the player's side of the map.  Abilities can be activated on anything that is eligible to recieve the effect.  The object is to destroy either the enemy team, or their two crystals which generally spawn fairly close to the unit spawn tiles.  Each race has different funtions, the Orcs seem to excell at causing large ammounts of damage with combat units but don't have many damaging ability cards, whereas the Team Fortress team relies on using support units to buff the damage dealing units.\n\nAll in all the base game at $5 is well worth it, the DLC expansion races seem a little high in price to me, but once they drop to 50% off I'll definitely be grabbing them.","August 11, 2012","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You select the team you wish you use, each featuring their own characters, spells and synergies and then off you go. Board is selected randomly as is your opponent, though you can select from your friends list.\n\nOnce play commences, each round gives you 5 action points with which to either place a unit, move a unit, attack with a unit, or cast a spell. Units and spells are randomly generated at the beginning of each turn to fill up to a selection of 6 items. Then you submit your turn and await the opponents manoeuvres in return.\nYou can aim to either wipe the board clear of opponents, or try to take out any crystals the opponent has on the board.\nYou can run more than one game at once which is great, and the game will notify you when a turn is ready to play your next round. so you can play this as a quick distraction game with two games running and login once a day or so, or you can start 20 games at once if you want a non stop session.\n\nI'm pretty crap at it so far. I quite like it. It's easy to pick up how to play and nothing feels very unfair even given the random nature of the  but i haven't invested the time yet to have developed the skill set to be a worthy opponent. At any rate, I was a bit sold given the pedigree of the developer. I really like their style of art and the animations, they also have a talent for making tight gameplay, apparently across different game types.\n\nSo far ive had no major dramas, except the occasional server connection issue. I have an odd codec issue on my box when i play but im pretty certain that's gonna be me and my clunky nerdbox more than a game issue.\n\nI scored Hero Academy in a Humble Bundle so the price was super sweet, it normally retails on Steam for about 5 bucks (with only two teams) which is well worth it. You can also get a two pack at a discount, to bring along a friend.\nHowever, the addon teams are each almost as much as the game itself which actually seems pretty steep. Even though they offer a wholly different experience to each other team, its hard to appreciate the high cost.","January 8, 2014","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've seen reviews giving it a thumbs down after only 10 or so hours of gameplay saying that it has no depth...they are very mistaken. This is a game that is quite easy to start playing, still quite easy to become rather good at but there are always another level of strategy for you to explore. This is the kind of game where you can't do it all by math and you can't do it all by gut feeling, you have to have a combination of both to be a successful player. Weigh your aggression with your analytic skills and you'll soon be a worthy opponent.\n\nSomething that I do feel is annoying is that you have to buy the different teams one by one, but on the other hand you can pick the game up for free for your android or ios pad or phone with one of the teams available and the games constantly comes up for sales. You don't need to have many teams to become a good player or enjoy the game.\n\nThe different teams are very different from eachother but still very balanced. There are some combinations where you feel that one of the teams have an advantage but you don't know what team the other guy is going to choose so you can't really plan for that.\n\nAll in all, this game is worth your time if you want a relaxing game that require you to think while playing rather than react to what is blinking on the screen.","December 27, 2013","true","232.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes a few times in a row.\n\nSometimes, after I make all my moves, I hit submit, and it tells me something like 'Failed to submit turn, please check your connection' (It's definitely not -my- connection). After this happens, no matter how many times I hit submit, it keeps returning the same error. If I click on another match, when I go back to the one with the error, about 1/2 of the time it makes me enter the move again, and sometimes still won't accept the turn submission.\n\nAnd sometimes, when I click on an existing match, the game board will be completely blank as if no one has started the game. If I don't recognize the name of the opponent, if I make my turn's moves and hit submit, it will return the error yet again. If I do recognize it, I know that I have to either go play another match, or restart the game. Sometimes this doesn't fix it.\n\nWhen the game works, it's actually very fun, but these errors happen EVERY COUPLE OF TURNS.

Worse you can't set up any turn rules to force the oponent to play.  I've finished play by mail campaigns faster than I got through my first battle in this game.

I feel like this was meant for a phone, because you send moves and wait for the other player to get back to you, which most of the time is really slow.\n\nLongstory short: Almost impossible to play a game with anyone since you send moves instead of doing it all at once","January 6","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But as it is only multiplayer, you won't be able to do anything much, as very few people play this now. Which is a shame.

The game itself is a fun, strategy-drawn game that you can use as a pass time while watching TV or eating peanuts. Also if your in to TF2 Each DLC Pack has a TF2 Hat and the Game comes with one to!
