I don’t see a reason why you shouldn’t buy it and play it, beside it’s in Early Access, but this game certainly looks mature. In my opinion this game can only be better, because it has good foundations, groundwork and developers just need to develop it in right way and they will have a good game. I recommend this game, even if it’s in early access. For €9 you can’t be wrong with this game.\n\nFULL PREVIEW: https://pcgamesnnews.wordpress.com/2016/01/28/preview-hot-guns/","February 26","true","2.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

"giustificata"\n- Tante armi da utilizzare\n- Acquisisci più monete possibili per comprare tutto l'arsenale che vuoi!\n- Carte Steam e Classifiche online!\n- Previsti aggiornamenti futuri, con tanti altri extra!\n\n\nParere personale:\n\nHot Guns, è un action dallo stile grafico semplice, ma dal gameplay abbastanza difficile!\nSpesso bisogna capire bene come affrontare un livello, poiché non è sempre facile!\nLo stile retro è molto simpatico, e le armi sono molto divertenti da utilizzare.\nL'unica pecca ad oggi è il prezzo del gioco, per il resto è un buon gioco che riesce a divertire ancora di più in multiplayer\n\n\nVoto:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=549022420","December 9, 2015","true","2.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","1"
