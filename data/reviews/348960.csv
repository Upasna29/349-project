"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/348960/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1196 products in account","Before wrapping up an actual review, I have to declare that I'm literature major. Thus, I have read and reread both Iliad and Odyssey more times than I can remember in my years. As being classical epics of Homer, they portray the Trojan War - a tremendously detailed bloody narration of never-ending epic carnages and its political attachments - and Odysseus' journey back home to Ithaca from the Trojan War: both a mythological and psychoanalytical journey of transcendence and growing up. This little HOG, coming from a small Russian developer basically butchers the epic of Odyssey.\n\nThe game starts up with a narration of the Trojan War and the presentation of the legendary product of Odysseus' famous wits and wisdom: the Trojan horse. We take on the joy of watching Odysseus and Agamemnon as best buddies. Then, we follow Odysseus through his many journeys, solving his famous adventures through HOGs and basic puzzle scenes. We see him becoming a chef for the cyclops, a friendly visitor for Helios, Poseidon and Circe; and finally, a returning hero who'd use a bee coven to get rid of the suitors of Penelope! Sorry for presenting spoilers on that part, but it really hit some nerve for me.\n\nAs you can see, the epic is HEAVILY watered down to be reimagined as child friendly - no violence, sexual encounter or political subtext - which I found to be greatly distasteful specifically for this tale. Any original tale, epic or story can be watered down to be kid friendly. I do not have any major problems with the idea, considering that Disney has been doing so for decades and pulling it off as marvelous work. Yet, the Odyssey is really a bad choice to be retold through a HOG for a new developer. It is an established tale that would create specific expectations - contrary to many other tales from Greek mythology - and picking such cumbersome work without much subtext or experience usually ends up as a disappointment. In my opinion, such was the case for this game. If this would be a completely new tale without the name of Odysseus, I'd probably be at least okay with it.\n\nAs a HOG, Odysseus: Long Way Home isn't anything masterful either. It sure is buggy, works quite slowly and aside the beautiful artwork, animations act so clunky and unnatural that you'd be creeped out watching Odysseus move or Circe talk. There is no voice acting. Puzzles are ordinary - not hard, not easy. HOG scenes are a bit repetitive, using same 2 scenes per act over and over again. There is no map, because there is only 3-4 areas for each chapter and a lazily done audio song swirling in the background.\n\nOver all, I'll pass and give a down vote for the butchered storyline, pretty yet slow display, run-of-the-mill gameplay and distorted animations. There are many great HOGs out there for your enjoyment, hailing from A+ developers or small firms telling original stories. Odysseus: Long Way Home is not one of them.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","January 25","false","3.9"," 48 of 52 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","48","52","0","17"

Please please please fix! So far I have been enjoying the game apart from that.","March 24, 2015","false","1.0"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","16","22","0","0"

While they managed to get most of the basics down this time, it is still easy to spot their inexperience.\n\nThe story should be familiar: Odysseus outsmarts the defenders of Troy and then spends a few decades on sea trying to get home. Don’t expect to see all of his adventures here though, especially all the gritty and lewd details: this story is 100% child-friendly, including even such famous parts as the dispatching of the grooms. Plus it looks like a story book with the lack of voice acting and cardboard puppet animations.\n\nThe hidden object scenes are rather nice, but the item usage feels clunky, showing that the developers weren’t comfortable with this genre yet. On the plus side, its awkwardness is what’s pushing game time over two hours, because there isn’t really much content besides that.","November 19, 2015","true","3.2"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","1"

I was dissapointed in this as I didn't have much time to 'connect' with the game as its only around 4 hours long. Odysseus: Long Way Home is a hidden-object game with a few other puzzle's included. The graphics wern't bad and the cutscene's made great screenshot opportunities. The hidden object scene's were fairly challenged but it got a bit repetative. I found the puzzle's  a little challenging and fun but there wasn't as much as I'd hoped there was. This is a great game to pass the time when you have nothing to do.","August 19, 2015","true","6.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I'm not sure if it is because I wsa using the mac version, or if the game does this naturaly, but the game would start to run so slowly that it would take forever to get and use items, and the only way to "fix" it was to open the menu and click fullscreen mutliple times, and I had to do this almost every time I would enter a room, even if I had been there before. I couldn't even get into the story all that much because of this problem. Though even if the problem was fixed, the game would still not be very good. They only inlcuded certain aspects from the original story, and they did it so poorly. If you have never read the stories that this game is based on and still want to play it, or even if you don't, you should definitly check it out.","February 2","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
