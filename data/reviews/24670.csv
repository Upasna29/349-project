I have been told several times that Trainz is the superior product anyway and that I should get it.  I have no idea what the people who said this to me were even thinking.\n\nThe instructions are awful, essentially non-existent, so you need to try to figure out the interface yourself.  This is possible but takes time to navigate the proprietary lingo and general disorganization.    I somehow deleted (or it just disappeared) a section of the HUD that gave me info on upcoming speed limits, the grade of the track, etc., and I never got it back, making the game unplayable unless all you really want to do is try to derail everything.  The only online communities I could find for help were all geared toward content creation, which seems to be the only thing people really enjoy about this since, I suppose, they can charge unwitting suckers like myself for it.  The section of the official wiki dealing with driving the train doesn't even exist.  The "manual" tells you the keys for doing things, but this is very basic and covers none of the actual problems you'll face.\n\nThe map?  You navigate it by right-clicking on individual points that are all buried in a massive amount of labeling, none of which tells you any information you might actually need until you've zoomed in so close you've lost all context.  You can't rotate it, but it will rotate on its on depending on the orietnation of your train.  There's no helpful color coding for cities vs. depots vs. any of the countless other things you need to find.  I am offended that this map even exists.\n\nAlso, on modern computers (i7) with good graphics cards (GTX 660) -- the performance is worse than on Windows XP and an old Geforce 8600.  I mean, bad.  Textures won't load sometimes.  When they do, they load very slowly.  The game simply stops working for seconds at a time.\n\nThe whole experience was just awful, bad enough that I actually took the time to write this review after finally giving up.\n\nI could go into more detail, but no one would bother reading it anyway.  Suffice to say, I spent hours on this game just trying to do one scenario.  I got through it and immediately deleted the game.  I wish I could delete it from my memory.","December 24, 2013","false","10.3"," 155 of 218 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","155","218","5","5"

The passenger system is great but the passengers just dissaper so thats a little bit disapointing. You get lots of trains and Coaches and that. The scenarios are fun because it takes 30 minutes or an hour to complete them so it should keep you very busy. Ever since N3V games made multiplayer, me and my friend did lots of scenarios together.\n\nCons:\n\nNot a lot of maps to select which was dissapointing because in Trainz Simulator 2010 you get a big selection of maps and more mods + it had the LMS Flyingscotsman and the Mallard but in this version you dont get those.\nFirst class tickets for download station are expensive so I think its a rip off.\nYou get very big lag spikes even though I have a high end PC so I had to turn off the shadows.\n\nOverall\n\nOverall I think its still a great game. The price is right and you get a lot of dlcs so you should check them out.\nI think Trainz Simulator is better then Train Simulator 2015.\n\nThanks for looking at my review :)\n","October 17, 2014","true","119.0"," 46 of 55 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","46","55","3","0"

Two upgraded computers later, I still have to cripple the draw distance and texture quality in order to play without the game regularly freezing up for a few seconds every time a bunch of new content needs to be drawn, such as when you pan the camera around.\n\n2) Included sessions (for which there are steam achievements) are often glitchy or tempermental in their willingness to aknowledge your progress.  A signal which should change automatically doesn't, resulting in you being unable to complete a session after investing an hour or more into it.  Or a session will suggest you are driving a long train, however you are only driving a locomotive with no actual stock attached.  Usually I like retail "games" to have more polish than this, and feel that this superb simulator is, unfortunately, not so superb a "game".\n\nFurther dissuading me from pushing this game on my friends is the fact that the developer, n3v/auran, has now embarked on a kickstarter campaign to fund creation of the next revision of the Trainz series, "Trainz: A New Era."  I don't expect the glitches or engine to get any extra polish/performance at this point.\n\n\nThat all said, however, I have enjoyed this game quite a bit since I got it.  The driving experience lets you choose often (in some sessions you are forced to use one or the other) whether to use DCC or CAB mode.  DCC seems to emulate an electric model railroad with a simple knob to control movement.  CAB mode attempts to emulate real railroads (I am not qualified to say how close it comes) by making the user interact with the reverser (forward/reverse/neutral), a range of throttle notches from -9 to 9, and, for when the engine is pulling cars and the e-brake won't cut it, a complex train brake where you cycle through initial -> lap -> application and watch the various brake pipe/cyl pressures adjust as they eventually bring the train to a stop.  The graphics can be nice, and seems many in-game objects have detailed dynamic behavior, from trees which have different graphics for each season, to train cars which have specific loading/unloading animations.  The content update hub is also a place for users to post their own content, and for other players to add it to their own collection, not unlike the steam workshop.  One can download locomotives, stock, scenery, routes, sessions, etc. which the community has uploaded simply by searching the interface and choosing to download it.  The system addresses revisions by content publishers in the community so that new revisions are included when other players with their content perform normal content updates.\n\nThe game has a surveyor mode, where you can create your own train routes and sessions, laying out terrain, tracks, signals, scenery, triggers, session start/end points, etc..  I played with it a little, covering the wireframe ground with snow and a loop of track that had a switch leading off to a roundhouse, in which I had some community-provided engines.  I got distracted long before I created anything fancy.   As others have documented, building a world is a very time consuming process, and some people take months or years on works which they still consider incomplete.  While working on your route/session in surveyor mode, you can fire up driver mode to drive through your creation and test it out and have some fun.  If you are happy with the results, you can then publish them to the hub of community content.\n\nAll in all, I think this game is a great sandbox, with some crazy demanding requirements for full graphics performance, and a handful of glitchy/buggy sessions.  While the community may continue to contribute content to the game, allowing content to continue to evolve, the engine is dated and not looking like it will ever have its performance-based frustrations addressed.  For the retail price, there are almost certainly more actively developed train simulator solutions.  If you already own it though, or it is on sale, you may get many hours of fun out of it.","December 7, 2013","false","267.7"," 74 of 115 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","74","115","0","5"

It has some issues I would agree (not a real speed "feel", gameplay gets laggy on most maps no matter your hardware, ability to eat way to many hours), but it more than makes up for those issues and more with the surveryor alone (the surveryor is what they call the building overlay. You can play for six months with the content that comes with the game, and their are huge amounts of addon routes and cars and engines available on the download station through  auran.com.\nThe longer you play with it the more you realize you could do with it. As an example I live in northern Mi (USA), and I have built myself most of the tracks in the state (excluding the upper peninsula). Then you find the download station and realize there are most routes and sessions than you could ever drive, ranging from beginner to simply evil in difficulty, and taking anywhere from a few minutes to a full day in drivetime.\nI am happy to have this game on steam where it kept up to date, common links all in one spot(again updated for me),  and is mine for the forseeable future no matter which computer I manage to kill.\nOh and once you get a handle on how the portals work give me a shout. Drive right from your coal mine through a tunnel and come out where ever you want (other maps, turned around, different location on same map, community maps).\n\nAnyway I highly recommend this title even over the dovetail games title just released.

I'd recommend it for the beginners and seasoned players, because of its ease of use and the concept of the game is moderately easy to learn, but again, the lack of tutorials is a let down for the game.","December 14, 2014","true","045.4"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

I would feel a bit cheated by the lack of quality control if I'd paid full price.\n\n==== Full review ====\n\nFirst, let's note the genre we're talking about here. This is a simulator, not a game as such; it's a bit like Flight Simulator in that if things are exciting, you're probably not doing very well. While it does have some less realistic modes, people who want a "toy trains" sort of game should probably look elsewhere.  However, if you want a taste of what it's like to take a mile-long freight train over Tehachapi Pass, using fully realistic cab controls, this is aimed solidly at you.\n\nThe locomotives are carefully and lovingly detailed, both inside and out, and each have their own unique sounds and handling characteristics.  While I'm by no means a rivet counter, I found the physics of both the overall train and the locomotive itself to be well-modeled, or at very least plausible.  This goes for both the diesel-electrics and the steam engines, which are a physics challenge all on their own.\n\nThe graphics feel dated; they're about what you'd expect of a big-budget game circa 2005.  They're certainly sufficient for the purpose, but I wouldn't play this game just to sightsee.  There's a nice mix of terrain and parts of the world, though, including the US, Britain, China, and Russia.  In spite of the relatively dated graphics, the game requires a fair bit of oomph to run.  Those whose gaming rigs are more than a few years old will find this game to be jittery.  There are also object and texture pop-up issues that can be distracting given the continual forward movement.\n\nBoth the routes and driving sessions are essentially fan-created.  This is understandable considering the effort involved in modeling hundreds of miles of railway.  Unfortunately, though, this means the quality varies wildly.  Some sessions are particularly well done, especially on the ECML Kings Cross-Newcastle and Mojave Division routes.  Others are frustratingly buggy, sometimes to the point of being impossible to complete.\n\nI did not try any of the multiplayer features, so I can't comment on those.\n\nOverall this is a reasonably engaging simulator, and the non-buggy sessions provide a nice spread of challenges.  If you're the type who needs to complete EVERY achievment, though, the buggy ones will frustrate you.","May 27, 2014","false","127.5"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

I mean really guys this is just bad... don’t even debate.\n\nWhere do I even start?\n\nFirstly and this is my biggest point that drives me up the wall. This is NOT a new/newer game. By the use of clever branding and publishing your led to believe that this. OH WOW, IT’S A NEW TRAINZ!!! ... Well don’t get too excite sat at ye-oldie computer because it’s not.\nIf you simply go into your “Rail yard” (which lists each loco/rolling stock for you to observe) you can see that 90% of the content, YET AGAIN has just been copied and pasted from the previous versions. I mean Big Boy ??. for crying out loud that was made for Trainz 2004 it looks a pile of A*** for one of the latest’s lines of train simulators.  Its laziness, pure and simple..\nHowever that being said, they have made some, and I mean some, new locos and stock that actually looks ok.\n\nThe sounds are awful, again like the locos, sounds have been taken from the Trainz backlog of games. This game screams nothing but laziness, essentially what you looking at is trainz 2004 with mix and matches on certain locos and routes in truth.\n\nIn terms of simulation there isn’t any,  well no more than some buttons that make you go forward and backwards, ok there is the complicated control system but its miles from simulated, it feels like someone who has a basic grasp of what things do and has just botched it together how he thinks is best.  So it’s not a great start is it?\nThe menu and in game overlay/system is far far far complex than it needs to be, like seriously what was wrong with a button that just opened up individual trains to place, here you have got to go create a consist somewhere and then once that’s saved you can load it up in game, it is just stupid.\n\nWant to know something that amazed me? I find it amazing how a Post PS2 era game with the same level of graphical detail can run THIS badly!!, ¬ seriously. I can run Train Simulator 2015 on full graphics reaching about 20fps in lag spikes and running normally at about 35-40fps\nthis game however runs like a slug, RUBBISH, I get 9fps at best, I turn down the graphics so it looks EVEN worse for very little improvement.\n\nThe only thing worth crediting on this game is the first appearance of Train Simulation in Multiplayer...ok it’s a short lived compliment because you can only drive from one map unless you come off the game and fiddle around with the content manager thing to get more, the trains are already placed even if you’re a server host and this far complicated menu system just makes the whole experience even more un-enjoyable.  However when you finally do get set up it can be some full playing with friends. But again short lived, because every time a player joins the game will send you miles and mile away from your own train for no apparent reason and it’s a fiddle to find “where you once where”\n\nI got this cheap but even cheap feels expensive, I would pay at best £5 for this ....\nOut of curiosity I bought a bundle of 16 Trainz DLC the other day for £2.99 to try out.... and there amazingly rubbish.  Just avoid at all cost is my advice. In fact go play train simulator its better ;)\n","November 22, 2014","false","44.2"," 41 of 70 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","41","70","5","0"

First of all, this is going to appeal to two very specific kinds of people:\n\n1. Those people who want to get into hyper-detailed train simulations.\n\n2. Those people who just like driving trains around, probably with their kids.\n\nI fall into the second camp, so I can't speak to the first camp at all.  I've spent my time with the game playing with my four year old son, just kind of driving around, trying not to exceed the speed limit, trying to stop at the stations, and looking at the scenery and inside the cars.\n\nThe graphics are dated, but things like the skies and the countryside are beautiful in their way.  There is a sense of verisimilitude that I really like, and the fact that the trains are fully animated throughout all their pieces is a big plus.  I'm able to show my son various parts of trains up close while they're working, and he's gotten a much better sense of how trains work than through some other explanations or even riding on them (he loves trains).\n\nThe controls are mildly awkward, the constant trouble with speeding or slowing too much is annoying, and the sense of speed of the train is... not very fast.  Slowing down is like stopping a truck full of bricks, it just doesn't want to happen.  Warning on when an actual platform that I care about is coming up would be nice, although via the map I was able to figure out more about it.\n\nIf you disable Hardware Transform and Lighting or don't use DirectX, expect interminable lag as you pan around.  With those on, it was very smooth for me.\n\nWe have yet to complete any of the runs, and don't really care.  We just hop into one and drive around, trying not to break the rules long enough that it will let us actually play.  I bought this on some sort of extreme discount, and at that price (maybe $5?) this was absolutely and positively worth it.  We've spent a couple of hours having a blast with it, and we'll likely spend several more.\n\nWould I play this on my own, without my son?  No.  I'd find it pretty frustrating if I was actually trying to complete goals.  But then again, I'm not squarely in the target audience for the adult side of this game.  Be sure and check out reviews from folks like that if you are.","October 6, 2014","true","1.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

There is new and upgraded engines and rolling stock but all in all, its lags unless you have a GOOD PC.","April 9","false","16.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Main","http://steamcommunity.com/id/16ajmain/","58 products in account","Although this game does not have the best graphics compared to it's competitor, Train Simulator(Railworks), it is still a great game. It has a MAJOR advantage over the world/route builder mode. In Train Simulator 2014, the builder mode is pretty complex & complicated, as for Trainz Simulator 2012, it is fast & easy as well as fun. Also, one part that I enjoy in Trainz Simulator is the easy access to change junctions easily. It's a fun & easy game that I recommend due to it's easy world builder & simple controls.","June 8, 2014","true","130.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Game looks quite similiar to Trainz Simulator 2004 (funny thing, my NVidia drivers detects TS2012 as TS2004) and works like S**T. The only thing you can do is to make a cfg that will tell the game to use more RAM memory, but that led my laptop (Lenovo Ideapad Y580) to hellish temperatures.

Once in game, it was extremely confusing and not clear on what needs to be done.  Took several minutes to jump through all sorts of hoops and perform dance rituals to get mutliplayer actually started after having to venture off to a website and signup/register cdkey.  Once in the multiplayer, we were able choose from a selection of WWII verterans with beards which appear to be "photoshopped" on using mspaint.  The in game graphics were nothing like what was displayed in pictures and controlling the train was far different than what was portrayed initially.  Everything looked like cardboard cutouts and yet still performed sluggishly on high-end systems.\n\nPros: It had multiplayer.  Didn't require NAT rules or port forwarding to allow others to join the game.  When CTRL+Right Clicking trains, it gave the option to "Run around train"... but my fatting/olding/bearding conductor merely stared out the window of the train in hopes for meaning in life.\n\nOverall:  Game did not last long.  There was no question for us to quit playing it immediately soon after we started.  I wish I could remove this game from my inventory and gift it to someone else as punishment.","March 16, 2014","false","0.8"," 19 of 33 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","19","33","0","0"

I did not possess a computer with the same abilities as I do now, so I will give this review another shot!\n\nNow that I can play this game, I realize how wrong I was about it!  The game comes with a good selection of routes (alot of countries, unlike *cough*TS2015*cough*).  And, plus the routes, it comes with an absolutely astounding amount of locos and rollingstock.  The engines have pretty decent sounds, but alot of them share the same, but are easily changed like TS2015.  The rolling stock actualy has awesome track sounds, once again something that TS2015 does NOT have.\n\nNow, we roll around to the content for the game.  Using the Content Manager tool, you can download and install a RIDICULOUS amount of content.  Best of all, 99% of the content is ABSOLUTELY free.  The only thing I can complain about is the slow download speed of the content manager.\n\nThe graphics for this game DO leave a little bit to be desired.  But, once again, I can not have them up on full, so I can't judge.  And, I lied the first time around, there IS an option to change screen res, but its a little wierd to find, and when I put it up to my compter's res, it lags like crazy.\n\nAnd lastly, this game posesses one thing that separate's the hypothetical "boys from men" in Train Simulation: MULTIPLAYER.  I personally have not used Multiplayer yet, but it opens up a range of opportunity that other games fail to give...\n\nFinally, this game is one of the better Train Simulators that I have played, and I would not hesitate to recommend this to friends, or anyone for that matter!\n\n*Note* does require a good computer with a decent processor to work!","December 29, 2014","true","118.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Unfortunately Trainz 12 is a backwards step.\n\nThe Big Issue:\nGraphics are bad. Doesn't look that good, and the graphics are very poorly optimised, so they cause graphical lag problems when they really shouldn't. The sound is not great either, feels contrived much of the time.\n\nThe Rest:\nThe DCC controls are for model train enthusiasts. I feel that as a computer game it would have been best suited to W <-> S for simpler controls. More complex controls do indeed follow an expanded version of that model, and have some level of satisfaction in their implementation.\n\nGameplay is fine, exactly what you'd expect from a sim. I feel that there could be more creativity in this department, and that TS2014 does it slightly better.\n\nUI requires too many clicks. Simply changing camera angle takes a lot longer than it should. Probably because of graphical issues, clicking on the levers in full simulation mode doesn't always work.\n\nUltimately one to avoid unless you get it free.","July 22, 2014","false","1.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

That's not even the end of it, that's just the built-in download station. If you go onto the internet to download mods you'll be greeted with THOUSANDS of addons (including Thomas ones which are the main reason why I still play this game). Another feature people glance over is the surveyor option. Majority of people who get this game usually go into Driver mode and play some boring slow tram sim. However if you go into surveyor, you're able to go on any route you have and put any train on it (eg putting Thomas carrying an airplane on the tiniest train track ever) and do whatever. Plus there's the route creator, which lets you create your own little detailed railway. Or you can create a rollercoaster.

In hopes that the new version would come out and be better than the previous versions, I have been wrong EVERY time.\n\nI have a very powerful machine that can handle any game on the market. This game is not smooth on my machine at all. In fact it is nearly unplayable. I know for a fact I am not the only one experiencing this issue for the forums are littered with this issue.\n\nNow I do know that many of the routes are very intense graphic wise. But like I said, I KNOW my machine can handle it. But it still skips and stutters and even freezes.\n\nI am leaning towards Steam being the issue. I have experienced this issue mostly on steam. The steam versions of games are crap and are not worth the money. I am going to purchase this game (hopefully at a discount) off the traiz site directly and see if it is just the game itself. I will write a review on that version as well.\n\nMy final thoughts are this. If you want to waste money with steam games, I obviously cannot stop you, but I can at least WARN you. You will get what you pay for and steam games are NOT worth your money. If it costs a little more directly from the game makers, I would recommend spending the extra cash.

The Blue Comet didn't even redownload after the crash and the game thinks I haven't even purchased it. Another problem with the game is that it runs poorly, even on high power systems, like 10 FPS. I'm amazed by the fact that this game managed to keep me entertained for over +300 hours, but now, it has lost all value to me. Going back to the poor performance, some levels wouldn't even want to load just because they were too detailed.

This game doesn't have trains. it has ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ TRAINZ. That's right, with a Z instead of an S. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you better buckle up and pull some levers because you're in for a trip of a lifetime. Trainz Simulator 12 offers amazing and realistic train gameplay, with only some downsides. Still, it IS at its core a train simulator, and the fact that some of the more modern trains have emergency brakes that go off as soon as your train goes over a speed limit is only good to show that jackasses nowadays don't know how to drive a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ train with style. Still the vintage models and routes are still a lot of fun, and I have yet to try the multiplayer out due to FOUR HUNDRED UPDATES that download at automatic-brake-train speed. That's right. This game has so much content that it has to update FOUR HUNDRED times before you can play online. And you have to do it SLOW.

The controls are intuitive (a bit of getting used to, but easy once you understand them). Most people who say that they can't play the game or that the tutorials are bad obviously haven't read the in-game messages. Every time something happens in game, a text box pops up to tell you. Unless you close every one of them as soon as they appear, the game explains how to do everything to the T. The tutorials take you from your first steps to driving freight across the rails in a very short amount of time due to the level of detail put into the explinations of how to do everything.\n\nBottom line, whether you are a new Trainz player or a Rail-ridin' expert, you will most likely enjoy this game.\n\nNOTE! You will probably NOT enjoy this game if you intend to do a mission in 10 minutes. This game is a SIMULATOR. It is intended to be realistic right down to the amount of time it takes to do things. If you can't handle that, don't buy this game.","April 2, 2014","true","3.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Or at least it did on my laptop. I'm willing to admit that my laptop isn't the fastest thing on the block and it pales in comparison to the beacon of graphical wonderment it once was, but it should at least be able to play a game released in 2011 with 30fps. I couldn't even reach 20 with the settings set to the lowest they went. Which is a great shame for something that should've been all right as a time wasting distraction. There is great promise in its mechanics and how the trains handle, but utimately, I can't even look at this pile of trash. Because of that one flaw, I couldn't possibly recommend you hand over money for this. Why pay for something great if you can't make out whats going on? It's like buying Citizen Kane full price, and watching it without the TV on. Try the newer Train Simulator 2014 if you're looking to play a train simulator on Steam. Not sure how it is, but it can't be worse than this.\n\n3/10","June 8, 2014","false","1.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Pretty basic stuff, happens with a lot of programs and .exe files. Unfortunately I must have done something wrong. Seeing as how I was currently watching YouTube videos my focus slipped and i pressed "no" to the changes. No big deal, or so I thought.\n\nTo my surprise the game still fired up and everything seemed just fine. The audio was a little loud but nothing I couldn't fix in the settings. lulled into a sense of security by the mechanic clangs and bangs from the many screen my guard was down. And to make a long story short a random train whistle, loudest I've ever heard struck my headphones. Me, being naturally deterrent to loud noises this still gave me such a fright that i tensed up my entire body. Including my toes.\n\nWhy focus on the toes you ask? This quite unfortunate event has left them in a sort of locked position. I am unable to move without tremendous amounts of pain shooting through my toes to my entire body.\n\nI am currently a captive in my own home and the dogs are barking, wanting me to let them out. I fear that if medical personnel don't arrive soon I will not be able to make it to work tomorrow, and on top of that Would have to spend the afternoon cleaning dog ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe aspects of the game I managed to try out in the 10 minutes I players seemed solid, if not for the loud noises. With that said the game has caused me more pain than any game ever has before, making it impossible for me to give it a good rating. I am a highly subjective person, I realize this.","September 15, 2014","false","0.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"

I thought I would give it a try being a TS2015 user.\nInitially I was a bit disappointed by the graphical interface, but hey this game is old.  Then it happened - stop start stop start as th FPS took a nose dive. I'm usung a 2.8ghz dual core intel processor and running a 2GB AMX 6670 - okay may not be the best rig, but it plays other games without problems.\nNot happy point 1.  Low FPS and games stuttering\nNot Happy Point 2. Then there are the updates, even after 4 days I still haven't got them all installed - apparently I have to buy a first class ticked to get a quicker download than 5.6k.  Bit of a lame way to get extra income from game players. Sorry but game updates should not have restrictions on down load speed or any other reason.\nNot Happy Point 3.  Tthe basic speed controller is rather ancient in design - reminds me of my Hornby controller of the 1970's and operates about the same!\nNot Happy Point 4. Level crossings - do they really stay open until the last moment in real life?  um nope, why here?\nNot Happy Point 5.  Disappearing trains, I drove the US Corridor route and arrived with 1 power coasch and 2 other coaches.  the other end of the train did not reappear until after I saved the game and finished the route.\nNot Happy Point 6 .  no difference between chase and lineside.  Also trains grow strange bits when you get close to them - take the big boy tender, with ists rather strraight curve towards the front of the tender from about 15ft out.\nNot Happy Point 7.  ECML from Hull,   Brough Station has never been on the GWR, so why is it advertising GWR trains.  & why are there GWR shelters elsewhere on the route.  Considering Auran don't do a stock GWR route, this is a bit odd to say the least.\n\nWell I have finished Hull Kings X and I am very disappointed.  constant stutter from the game.  I changed the graphics settings to normal and this made no difference.\nSomehow the game decided cab view was the top of the rear facing  drivers compartment, looking backwards.  Speed control is yukky to say the least, with less than a couple of pixels between 99 & 101mph.  After going through one tunnel I discovered the forward reverse had switched and came to a halt.\nThe only joy was to see 1970's BR rolling stock on the route.  Also is it possible that in the entire 200 odd miles I only passed 1 DMU heading south?  The lack of service trains  at Kings X was also a slight concern, but giving how slow the game was I dread to think what would have happened if they got several commuter DMUs coming out of the station.\n\nAs to do I by the new Trainz.  Um no Way.","December 28, 2014","false","68.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has something for everything. Want a kids layout? The game has wooden track and kids trains. The game even has an airplane and a helicopter. So many trains. and SO MUCH SCENERY! My one thing I hate is that there isnt as many layouts as in games such as trainz 2009 and trainz 2006.

I've had TRS 2004, and TRS 2006, and this by far is the best one. One thing I enjoy about is it actually alerts me about up coming signals, and stations so I have time to slow down when I'm hauling a lot of freight.\n\nNow, there's a few things that do make me angry about this. Here's a list of them:\n\nParts that anger me:\n\nAdding additional settings to the game is no longer possible in the config file as it is binary written to file now, rather then plain text. So changing features that the options window doesn't list, but the game uses, can no longer be applied.\n\nThe `Content Manager' has a download quota of 100.15 MB A DAY. I realized this when I was downloading some locos, I got 100 megs and tried downloading the dependencies.. nope. If you download anymore then that they want you to buy some `First class ticket' which costs REAL MONEY. That's an outrage!\n\nYou charge people $30 for the main simulator itself, then another $50 for DLC then shove this ticket stuff down their throats when they try and get good content that the comunity made? That is rediculous. The download rate from the servers is only a max of 12 KBPS without a ticket! It took me all night to get that 100 megabytes of addons downloaded thanks to that. There was NOTHING that told me about this before I bought the game.\n\nHowever, their website of `Download station' does not limit the downloaded files if you use FTP. But trying to find a specific addon that's listed within the content manager search window may not be easy.\n\nSome of the headlights of the trains don't work, or barely work at all. Some of the night missions are almost too dark to see because the train's themselves don't have working headlights(Could be improved in the future however).\n\nThe simulator still lags on my high end rig, and I find it sort of strange how the options window doesn't have the same settings that 2006 did with all the tuning settings. However lowing settings did fix a lot of performance issues, but the simulator's engine has a lot of room for improvement.\n\nThings I like about it\n\nThe simulator is great for train enthusiasts looking for something to enjoy. It has a powerful world editor, and realistic controls. It can teach you basics of driving trains and designing railways.\n\nMultiplayer is available for those who want to play multiplayer with their friends, or relatives -- though I have not been able to test multiplayer.\n\nYou can create your own custom content to use in your game if you ever felt the need, or want to do so. Share it with users around the globe to show your interest world wide.\n\nThe simulator itself has pretty straight forward missions, good instructions, and a ton of driving hours available on routes. Once you get into it, and you enjoy it, there's a point of no return.\n\n\nMy Conclusion:\n\nThe game is great if you want to make your own railway, drive routes, or play with your friends. It's probably the most stable one there is on steam, however the game does have restrictions.\n\nSo help me, if you turn into Electronic Arts, or Microsoft, I am done with your games and content for good.","March 31, 2014","true","39.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Found out in the launcher there are options to fix it. So on with the game. I get into the game start up a tratorial and the instructions on the screen blocked the screen so i could not see what it was even talking about. After a bit i gave up thought ill just play and learn as i go. i go back to the main menu selected the do a train route thinking ill just jump in and play.

I have 50+ hours on this game because i let it download all updates over night while i sleep, and 10 hours later it only has downloaded less than half a dozen assets. yes, you can vertify game integrity by steam, but that still doesnt put the game up-to-date.\n\ngameplay, theres easy and complex, like train simulator. I like how you can load and unload cargo and industries. and how massively long you can make trains too. first mission i've played was a 7 locomotive haul, which took a minute of fast panning to view the end of my train.\n\nits good. not great, try something else i guess.","July 1, 2014","false","55.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then went to start the game and it took an hour for nothing then when it finally booted up i was stuck in a full screen game with too low of a resalution. They dont let you window mode or bring up the resalution (this would not be a problem if not for the fact i only have a 720P TV screen and all im getting is red lines and dots on my screen). It sucks balls im not even going to try to play it since i cant see much of the screen anyway.\n\nI give this game a 1/10\nAt least they tried to make a game.\n\nI tried the game again not knowing i already experianced this game. Thinking i had played TS and not trinz anyway on with 2nd review\n\n2nd encounter:i booteed up the game encounters the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ resalution and looked it up online to see hoe to fix this. Found out in the launcher there are options to fix it. So on with the game. I get into the game start up a tratorial and the instructions on the screen blocked the screen so i could not see what it was even talking about. After a bit i gave up thought ill just play and learn as i go. i go back to the main menu selected the do a train route thinking ill just jump in and play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/romla/recommended/24670/","romla","Romla","http://steamcommunity.com/id/romla/","1560 products in account","Terrible game. Before I could play it it was updating some database for many long minutes, then it didn't started at all, but didn't close either. After manual restart it was updating the same database again. Then it started and after a minute or so it crashed the whole computer. After restart it was updating the same database again. After 2 hours I was finally able to play the game. I have completed the tutorials and tried to play one scenario. But even after many hours of trying I wasn't able to complete it. Because most of the time it is not absolutely clear what you are supposed to do. Even when you figure it out, often you are unable to do it, because some lights will just stay red no matter what you do. Sometimes when you give over the controls to the AI driver you are able to continue, sometimes not. Sometimes when you save the game and load it again you are able to continue, sometimes not. It is a complete lottery. After many hours I was almost able to complete the scenario, but I have lost all my patience already. Moreover the graphics is not very good and the performance is absolutely terrible. While the other Train Simulator (2016) game on Steam is also very far from being perfect, especially with its DLC policy but also because of other problems, it is in many aspects far superior to this game. Hence I am rather recommending that game for train fans over this one. I am not recommending this game at all, only if you have more patience than Buddha which I have not.","March 19","false","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
