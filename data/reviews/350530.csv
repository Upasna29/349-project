Because that's what I try to be. I give credit where credit is due and there are parts that i enjoyed very much about the game.\n\nPerformance wise this is one of the best running title in the Firefighter Simulator Franchise, this is achieved by many loading screens that split the areas into smaller sectors. With that VIS was able to  put more detail into the single sections.\n\nThe Story line is loosely based on Ladder 49, down to the name of the protagonist, but there are twists and turns that are not in the movie. VIS Wanted to make sure that all players have a similar experience in the game, not like in previous versions where some had all the action and some had only garbage can fires. Unfortunately they overshot their goal by about 2 miles.\n\nThe game feels like a on-the-rail shooter with little variation. Freedom is no longer a word to be used in the same sentence with this game. In fact i think that the word Simulator in the title is misleading. There is no freeplay mode whatsoever and you can only replay certain missions on different difficulty settings.\n\nThe Vehicles are much better in handling and appearance, and the addition of American Apparatus feels fresh and is a step in the right direction.\n\nHowever that does to little too late to save the game from a thumbs down verdict, there was lot's of potential but unfortunately nobody capitalized on that.\n\nThe Main Storyline with side missions is about 2 - 2.5 hrs of gameplay with little more after that and almost no replayabillity value.\n\nI hope that VIS patches a freeplaymode in, in a future update.\n\nOverall I can not justify the purchase price and if you really want this game i would wait 6 weeks when it probably  will be sold for $5.\n\n\n\n","May 16, 2015","false","7.4"," 33 of 45 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","33","45","6","3"

Must be a European concept...\n\nI have played this game start to finish, and I'm satisfied overall.\nWhen the game works, it is fun- Even exciting.\nThe main mission is broken up by a series of other missions- They often involve manning the Fire Engines.\nIf you've played Firefighter 2014, this will help immensely.\nThe soundtrack is also fairly good on some stages, such as 'Onset of Winter'.\nThe english voiceovers were cheesy, but clean. They're a good laugh at the very least.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a few issues with the game.\nAs stated, the Fire Engine control scheme is much more complex. I wished they had used the same exact control scheme as your firefighter.\nThe game suffers enormous lag whenever more than one character is on the screen.\nThis can be infuriating at times, because you fail your mission if you don't reach a checkpoint within the time-limit.\nThese contributed to a majority of my losses. The only other being some of the jumping sections in the game.\nNot to mention when you leave the Firestation, every engine in the Dept. acts like a starving wolf chasing a steak.\n\nNevertheless, definitely glad that Steam gives you access to obscure games like this. If you've got a little cash, and there's a sale- Go for it!","January 15","true","3.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"
