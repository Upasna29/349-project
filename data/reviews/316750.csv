Such a shame that in this day and age, we can't get a working, updated version of Tetris. After the fiasco of the next gen console releases and total lack of support for fixing them for just under a year now, I don't know why I'm surprised.\n\nNo, I cannot recommend this to anyone as it stands now. The game keep crashing, you can't remap your controls, very clunky user interface. I'd like to give an opionion about actual gameplay, but I can't due to the constant crashes. From what I can tell, seems to be a direct port of the console versions, slow play and slow line clear delay.\n\nI'm going to give it some time to see if Ubi does anything about these issues, but I'm holding no hope going by their previous track record for the console games.\n\nVery happy that I can get a refund through Steam for this as it's the ONLY reason I decided to purchase and try it. Was hoping to finally get a decent game with decent multiplayer, but I guess I'll have to just keep on waiting.","December 10, 2015","false","0.9"," 180 of 198 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","180","198","5","8"

But I've actually been able to play without crashes on both systems after\n- Running steam and Uplay as administrator and verifying the integrity of the game cache\n- On 1 system, I also had to run the game on Win 7 compatibility mode\n\n(edit) More time needs to be spend to actually review the gameplay, but the game is playable. First impression:\nThere are too many small annoyances (menu, audio, visual) that has nothing to do with gameplay/game modes itself. So overall, it leaves a bad taste, even though the gameplay itself might be decent. For now, overall, I'd still not recommend it ( it's not completely rubbish, just mediocre and definitely not "Ultimate"), but I think that one could enjoy it casually on a rainy day.\n\nIt should also be noticed that a quad core recommendation is insane for a tetris game with a 'casual' tag.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kastle09/recommended/316750/","kastle09","kastle09","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kastle09/","127 products in account","Okay finally arrived better late then never. I have played only about an hour and dabbled in most of the game types (Except the ones that crashed) and here's what I think.\n\nLets start positive because there are some good things. It looks great. I like the aesthetics it is probably one of the better looking versions of Tetris there is. People who prefer the really really minimalist designs in some of the unofficial variants like Lockjaw or Nullpolimo might not like it but I do, especially when you compare it to last gen which i really did not like. There are also a good number of game modes so every kind of player will find something they are after, whether its Marathon, Sprint or Battle. Okay thats all I got for god things so lets move on.\n\nMy criticisms are divided in 2 minds, one as an aspiring game designer and one as a Tetris fanatic.\n\nI really dislike the approach to TU's Menu design. It looks good, and animates well. But its not intuitive and clutters the screen with a lot of information most of which is hard to direct around at first. Especially since there is no real tutorial. Or I should say there is one but its placed in a spot that no first time player is gonna find. And when you do get to it you are faced with an encyclopedia of text. If you were trying to follow the instructions you would have to constantly flop back to that menu.\n\nI could understand if the dev team wanted to not have the players go through menu after menu but I would of rather something simpler. A starting menu that says "Online, Solo, Settings, Profile" which then opens up into something else. instead of an overwhelming amount of text as soon as you hit start.\n\nOn the subject of clicking things. I'm not sure why they decided to make somethings clickable and somethings not. Everything in the footer requires key presses and somethings require clicks. You have to be a little more consistent than that. Its like trying to play an FPS in an options menu. Also who thought it was a good idea to make the two keys to press "O" for confirm and "Backspace" for exit. Those keys are in the middle of nowhere and doesn't relate to any of the keys during play.\n\nAnd now we come to some issues with the gameplay.\n\nSomething happens the faster you want to play and it comes from your expectation compared to what happens. 2 things that are really critical is line clear speed and when you are allowed to rotate the incoming piece. The longer that delay is between what you want to do next and when the game allows you to do it Is very important especially the faster you want to play. Very important for sprint players.\n\nI am not that quick of a player, relatively speaking compared to the really really hardcore players, but even I am getting irritated with the delay. When you know what to place next, and when you know you hit the button to rotate, but the game lets you down by not keeping up with you. Its very frustrating aspect.\n\nThe decision to allow sensitivity was good. Maybe not to the degree I'd like, something finer than a 1-10 scale would of been nice, but a lot of variants don't have it so fine. The decision to Lock the Controls and the Piece orientation on the other hand is baffling to me. I had no idea they did this because I thought it was a given before it came out. I play with the numpad because it means I can rotate both ways with just my right hand. Thats how I play thats whats comftable for me. I also don't like using the space bar for drop, I prefer a smaller key and one next to my hold like "z" because i prefer using my index finger instead of my thumb.\n\nthese specific issues for everyone to play a certain way makes me think Tetris Ultimate had a very clear goal in mind and I'm not one that likes it.\n\nIf you are a casual player who doesn't play tetris often, maybe occasionally a long time ago. The game is fine. There are bugs here and there (3 of the game modes crashed on startup for me in the first 20mins) but its manageable, and if you are able to navigate the god awful tetris party up system, its okay.\n\nThe problem is I don't think its worth it to get it on PC. because if you are playing causally, 4 controllers will work, 4 keyboards won't.\nMore pressing is I don't think its worth your $15USD. You can get the same things from other outlets that let you satisfy that craving and then move on... and get back to Fallout 4 or something. If you hadn't already bought the game on your XBone or PS4, theres no reason to get this version.\n\nIf you are like me and you are a Hardcore player. This game is missing far to many options and crashes to many times to be taken seriously for your time. If you are a marathon player you would rather play TGM, if you are a multiplayer player you would rather play Top or Cultris. If you are a sprint player you would rather play Nullpol or Lockjaw. Most of them cater what you are after, better. and most of them are Free to play as well.\n\nThe only reason you would play Tetris Ultimate is if you hadn't tried any others.","December 10, 2015","false","13.2"," 106 of 115 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","106","115","0","3"

I was so excited! And then I saw the reviews. I figured I'd waited this long so I should still buy it and give it a shot. If it's bad I'll just refund it, right?\n\nI will be submitting my refund request as soon as I finish this review.\n\nFirst thing I noticed is that I had to initiate uPlay which always reminds me of those people in high school who try to include themselves in everything you and your friends do. And since I never use uPlay, it had to update first, I had to enter the product key for the game, and then wait for it to decide to let me play.\n\nThe second thing I noticed is that my controller didn’t work. At all. I didn’t try very hard to fix it (because I’d already lost hope), but nothing I did made it so I could use my controller in any part of the game.\n\nThe menu didn’t look bad, but it was a little over the top for a tetris game. It seemed like it was designed for a touch screen. Also the key bindings in the menu were strange. Who uses the letter “O” to accept changed settings?\n\nThe gameplay didn’t seem very different from the mobile app I use, though I didn’t play it for long.\n\nNow the music on the other hand was terrible. I thought I was playing tetris, not haunting a victorian era mansion! The only time that kind of music would be appropriate for tetris is if you were playing in a funeral home.\n\nUbisoft, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you haven’t been flipping the pages on your calendar, but it’s 2015. How is it that you couldn’t make a decent tetris game? All I want is to move around different shaped blocks with catchy music playing in the background. Because of you, Ubisoft, I’m just going to download a ROM of tetris from the days when game developers didn’t have their heads so far up their butts they could make a simple game about falling blocks that didn’t sound like it needed some freaking zoloft.","December 10, 2015","false","0.2"," 45 of 49 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","45","49","4","2"

You can't remap the keys, which is pretty standard on PC. There are only a handful of single player modes, and they're all just variations of straight up Tetris (no 3d tetris, column tetris, etc). I have a feeling they're going to make you buy all of the "fun" modes they've come up with over the years from the store for 5 bucks a pop.\n\nThe only mode I WANT to play (Endless) is locked behind getting level 15 in Marathon. Maybe I'm too old for this game, but by about level 9, Marathon is too fast for me to be accurate in my block placement and I fail pretty quicky after that. So... I guess I'm just never playing Endless mode?\n\nThey've focused too much on social play and stats, and not enough on just making the game fun to play. I don't play Tetris to socialize. It's not a social game. Not only that, but it's attached to UPlay, which is a useless relic they're still trying to push on people.\n\nIn short, it's like UbiSoft is stuck in an echo chamber, conveniently sheltered from everything anyone's ever complained about with Tetris. It doesn't need to be social. It doesn't need a cash shop. Get your base game stable and up to par for a PC game, and then we can go into those areas.","December 10, 2015","false","0.9"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","32","38","0","3"

The content currently found in Tetris Ultimate is nowhere near the value of $15-$19. Tetris by default has a ton of replayability though, and the core concepts of Tetris go uninterrupted for the casual fan. There's several game modes as outlined, and each one barely scratches the surface of where these styles of play originated from. However, even with the shallowness of these modes, they're all bundled together in a package deliverable to the casual player.\n\nBig negative points given for no native button mapping nor controller remapping support. Casual players, the targeted audience of this game, are the ones who require this feature the most. It is 2015 right?\n\nNegative points are given for a lack of colour and style choices. It can be difficult to make out the ghost pieces, and not everyone tolerates the default colour scheme or skins. Not to mention there's no colour-blind mode for those impaired.\n\nIf Ubisoft or TTC provide 'DLC' (should be free content patch) then this game will certainly be a requirement in any casual fans library on Steam.\n\nHardcore Game\nNot going to bore anyone with long winded paragraphs, here's everything I found wrong with the game competitively:\n\n- No IHS/IRS\n- The ARR and ARD scales are 1-10 only, with no inbetween\n- The ARR and ARD scales are on the low end of speed spectrum. 7-10 could be nearly 2x-3x faster.\n- Garbage is terrible all around\n- Bag system seems to bug out (I got 4 I blocks in just 2 bags?)\n- No option for line clear delay speeds\n- Online matchmaking 'battle' mode has terrible locked in presets, needs to be faster\n- No button remapping in 2015\n- UI isn't truly scaled to different resolutions\n- Can't customize the UI when playing Sprint/Battle/any mode, the preview and hold boxes are locked in place\n- Can't change the bright colours, very hard on the eyes to play more than an hour\n- Steam and uPlay integration is pretty lacklustre\n- There's more, but its just too much to list\n\nIfyou bought the game, and there's no patch by January 2016, refund the game.\n\n","December 10, 2015","false","2.1"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","29","38","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dceric/recommended/316750/","dceric","DCeric","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dceric/","608 products in account","Tetris is one of my all time favorite games.  I keep calling myself a "Pro" even though i'm likely as fast as any average player of the game.  Tetris Ultimate is pretty much like every Tetris game you've played.  The game has a lot of modes in which can be unlocked by playing other modes.  I won't go to much into each and every mode cause most of them weren't that fun.  I'll say the ones I liked which included Marathon (beating 15 lvl's), Endless (...endless until you read the top), Sprint (get 40 lines).  Marathon can be a tad difficult but likely most people will beat it and Sprint is pretty simple cause there is no level increase.\n\nThe other modes for me were pretty difficult however if I give the game more time I will probably be able to play them a lot better.  Anyways the game is fun but extremely flawed and as big fan of the Tetris series this is the biggest downfall.  I would love to give this game a good review however as broken as it is there is just no way I can do that.\n\nAt this current time the biggest issue is the game crashes.  To solve this issue when the game starts up run Marathon mode and close it and start a new mode.  That pretty much solves the issue even though the game still tends to crash at random times.  Luckily for me the game has never crashed during game play its usually right before a match or when you choose to close the game.\n\nThe next big flaw is the multiplayer which is a big flaw and of course will make people quite upset.  For me I have family that will likely enjoy playing with me and that would be great if we could all sit down with controllers in our hands and play together... But of course that won't work unless one person is using a keyboard cause if you set the games main control method for player 1 to controller none of the other controllers will respond for input methods for more players.\n\nThat is a big flaw and I would really love to give more of good review for this game but at the moment I can't.  There is online multiplayer but cause of the issues this game has people are likely not wanting to play this game.  Maybe its the price which at this time I see balancing from $14 to $19 on Steam.  So if your a big online multiplayer fan you'll probably end up playing Tetris Friends which is free.  I haven't been able to connect to anybody on Tetris Ultimate yet.\n\nPeople have been trying to contact Ubisoft about the issues I have explained.  I seen in the discussion for the game from Ubisoft in the community tells you ways to fix the game.  That is great that they do this however its not exactly methods that would fix the game and almost feels like they don't plan on updating the game so its a "we'll just leave this here and maybe this will help".\n\nAnyways Ubisoft were waiting for you at this moment in time yes you'll see me playing this game off and on for its single player modes but I just can't recommend this to anyone who isn't advanced enough to solve the issues this game has.  I also can't recommend it if multiplayer mode is broken considering its something I would enjoy to do with family.","December 26, 2015","false","1.8"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","1"

Then it was released and instantly had bad reviews, so I waited for the price to drop before buying it. Even though the reviews were almost universally bad, I figured, it couldn't really be THAT BAD, right?\n\nWrong. It really is that bad.\n\nSingle player is okay on a higher end PC: i5 processor, Geforce GTX 745, 8 GB ram gets me high 50s for frame rates.\n\nOn a low range Core 2 Duo, with 2 GB ram, and a Radeon HD 2400 XT I can get 25-30 frames per second with everything turned down in single player.\n\nBut why so hardware intensive for a puzzle game that's been around for 30 years? Obviously it was poorly optimized for PC.\n\nStill, I could have overlooked this if local multiplayer worked right, but it doesn't. You can get an Xbox360 controller to work in single player by turning on controllers in the Options/Extra menu. However, when you try to add in a second player for multiplayer is where the real shortcomings of this poorly done port occur. You can add the second controller on the main screen to initiate multiplayer by pressing the A button but after that you can't actually start the match because the second controller then becomes completely unresponsive. So this completely ruined the main reason I wanted this game for 4 player Tetris.\n\nAdd to this wonky menus, uPlay (not that bad but just 1 more annoyance to a game that doesn't work) and no ability to rebind keys and I'm just waiting 2 weeks and keeping my play time under 2 hours so I can get a refund if nothing gets fixed. Actually, any kind of patch to any of these issues might at least convince me that Ubisoft cares enough about it's product that I might decide to keep the game. Sadly, this seems unlikely as most of these issues have been reported since the launch of Tetris Ultimate on December 10 and nothing has come out (ie: we know and we're working on it) or any updates whatsoever. The only thing Ubisoft has is a guy saying, "Submit a support ticket”.\n\nSave yourself the trouble, don't buy it until you see that it's actually been updated to work.\n\nEdit: I gave Ubisoft the two weeks to make any change or to at least acknowledge the many issues that are occurring, and unfortunately, nothing positive has happened, so I am requesting a refund.\n\nOn a side note, if anyone has a Wii, Tetris Party Deluxe is an awesome game that has multiple game modes, plays smooth and supports 4 player local multiplayer! It’s all the things Tetris Ultimate should have been. I picked it up used on Amazon for about $20.","February 8","false","1.5"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

Visually I really like this version of Tetris a lot and the gameplay feels pretty good to me overall, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to request a refund and wait until the first 2 points below are definitely addressed.\n\n1. Fix random crashing. (All drivers up to date, PC way above minimum specs - still random crashes selecting game modes or exiting the game}\n\n2. Better input support. (Multiple Joysticks useable for local co-op, re-mapable keys/buttons)\n\n3. Add multiples of the same AI difficulty... For example I want to play a 4 player battle, but can't add me vs. 3 Intermediate bots. They currently all have to be a different skill level and it makes no sense.\n\n4. Music, normally whenever I read about people complaining on music or visuals I ignore it, but yeah... First time I ever had to shut off BGM to any game. Maybe put in something like the music from the promo trailer... Even that is like 10x better.\n\nI have my doubts this game will get much better considering I read how lack luster the support was for the console launches. It's a real shame too because this was a great opportunity for Ubisoft launching the first version of Tetris available on Steam. Hopefully they will spend the time to get some things fixed up and it would definitely be worth the $14.99, but if they don't I wouldn't bother unless it was for single player only and maybe on sale for $5 maximum.","January 17","false","4.7"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

Especially if you buy for multiplayer.\n\nI have been in contact with ubisoft support to fix the issues, but there hasn't been any improvements outside of keyboard rebinding update.\n\nUplay I'm just fine if some games are Uplay only. However they didn't seem to know what they should do with Steam and Uplay, so they decided to go with both! So half of the features, including cloud saves and achievements are on Steam, while other part, including account and online, are handled by Uplay. So no matter where you get the game, you need to have both running in the background. This makes absolutely no sense to me.\n\nControllers and multiplayer If you play with keyboard, at least they got in key rebinding half year after the release, so it's playable like that. With controller, they have to first be enabled from settings to first player, so no playing from sofa for you. Game always tells you only the keyboard keys to push, even if you use controller. If you use any other controller than Xbox 360 one, all the buttons are all over the place and does random things and there's no way to change them at all. If you try to play multiplayer, first player controls both first and second players, making multiplayer basically impossible, basically completely broken feature. I haven't gotten into single online game, at all, ever. And every time I booted my DS to play tetris online years ago there were always somebody playing.\n\nCrashing Some seem to have problems to even start the game, which I haven't personally stumbled upon, but there's quite well known bug that game will crash when you start the gamemode. Workaround is to either set both steam and uplay to offline or start marathon mode, quit it and then start the mode you want. It hasn't been fixed and there are others who can easily reproduce this, so it just tells how professional the QA were and how much work there was done.\n\nGameplay OK so the regular, single player gameplay, is relatively solid. Haven't faced much issues with that and it works exactly like I would presume tetris to work. They were pretty nice to include all the DLC they had on consoles with base game as well. However it still doesn't feel like "ultimate" tetris compared to all the other versions I have played on consoles and it does feel quite dull with it's audiovisual design. I do not mind bit calmer visuals as that way it's easier to focus on game, but especially music feels too generic and calm, when I'm used to so fast paced music.\n\nOverall pointIt still feels easy money grab instead of actual tetris made by developers who love tetris. Because it's pretty hard to ♥♥♥♥ up tetris, which this game luckily haven't done, but everything around that basic single player game is either not working or not up the par. This is not good on PC where you have tons of freeware choises starting from flash based browser games. I would've wanted the Ultimate version, version of tetris that has all the possible game modes and feels like made in <insert current year> but what I got is lazy port of console version nobody loved.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nSama suomeksi, nyt ei vaan jaksa.","May 22","false","2.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

The non-opinion central flaws include:\nGraphical inefficiency- "fastest" is practically the same performance as "fantastic"\nLack of graphics customization- "Background effects", "Menu Float", "Resolution", and "Fullscreen Mode" are all you've got, besides a general quality slider (see above, "fastest" to "fantastic")\nTotal lack of control scheme customization\nRequiring the player to select their control scheme (keyboard / controller) for it to become usable\nLack of corresponding UI when controllers are used\nMusical monotonyAs for opinions, personal quips include:\nMusic is either too ethereal or mediocre sounding\nKeyboard control scheme doesn't make any sense compared to the Xbox controller scheme\nText is hard to read the closer it is to the edges due to consistent chromatic abberation across all graphics qualities\nGameplay effects sometimes make it hard to see the ghost piece\nWhy on earth did the right stick on the controller need to be used to change options instead of Highlight Option -> Press A -> Use Left Stick to adjust -> Press A to confirm, B to cancel?But enough of just lists. Let me go into more depth.\n\nControl SchemesI mentioned earlier that the keybaord control scheme didn't make sense compared to the Xbox controller scheme. If you don't have the game, you're probably wondering what they did. I'll list it for you!\n\nKeyboard: Move Left: Left Arrow\nMove Right: Right Arrow\nRotate Clockwise: Up Arrow\nRotate Counterclockwise: Ctrl\nSoft drop: Down Arrow\nHard Drop: Spacebar\nHold: Shift\nPause: Escape\nXbox Controller: Move Left: Left Stick, Left OR Pad Left\nMove Right: Left Stick, Right OR Pad Right\nRotate Clockwise: B\nRotate Counterclockwise: A\nSoft drop: Left Stick, Down OR Pad Down\nHard Drop: Left Stick, Up OR Pad Up\nHold: Left or Right Bumper\nPause: Start\nEdit Value (Options, Starting Level, etc): Right Stick, Left or Right\nThe keyboard control scheme did it's best to make all of the keys accessible within a certain area, but it doesn't feel right to me at all. I'm pressing space with my pinky, not my thumb, and that is awful. A better scheme for keyboards would give your left hand access to most Tetrimino control while allocating your right hand to rotation. Of course, that would be best for right-handed players- flip it for left-handed.\nSeperately, the Xbox controller scheme is highly subject to human input error- accidentally inputting "Up" while trying to input "Left" or "Right" is very, very common.\nRegardless, to enable a control scheme for usage in gameplay or in menus, it must first be selected in Options -> Extra.\nWhy on EARTH is this an "Extra" option?! This should be a Gameplay option, if anything.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, when you switch the control scheme, the UI doesn't change to match, so you have to guess inputs based on what I assume is "common sense"... except, as someone who doesn't play Xbox (360 / One) games, and purchased an Xbox 360 controller purely for native controller support, it's actually guess work.\nThe game also assigns buttons to actions that otherwise have no gameplay equivalent- the [O] key is used to confirm some settings, or replay the current game mode, with it's controller equivalent being "X" on the controller. These aren't used anywhere but when navigating menus, and they aren't listed in the game's (rather helpful) tutorial, also found in the Extra options.\n\nGame ModesIf you're a member of Tetris Friends, several of these modes are familiar, though some of them are different from their Friends counterparts. (Check the game description for details on each.)  These include Marathon, which is a simple "clear 150 lines" challenge, Endless, which is Marathon but it goes forever, Sprint AKA "40 Lines" mode, Ultra, which is a three-minute score attack, Battle and Battle Ultimate, head-to-head without or with items, respectively, and three other gimmick-centered game modes. Most of these modes play exactly as they sound, and they are fun to play, generally.\n\nMost if not all of the available game modes can be played side-by-side in a Versus mode, up to four players at a time. Additionally, they can be played co-operatively as well, featuring a larger, "shared well" that everyone drops their pieces into. Furthermore, a "Team Versus" mode is available, setting teams of two against each other with two shared wells, one for each team.  I have only been able to test Versus against AI opponents for this review, as there is a huge lack of players.\n\nI'm Running Out Of Space, So Here's My Overall ThoughtsIt's actually a decent game. It's plays like a Tetris game, once it's actually running decently (which requires a super-high end computer of some sort for highest quality graphics, otherwise the lowest quality still needs a medium-end computer). I spent two hours of my life so far playing this game and actually enjoying it, despite having some input lag due to the graphics being inefficient. As far as I can tell, it's fully playable despite it's flaws!\nMultiplayer is dead though.\n\nA similar, better experience can be found in Tetris Ultimate for 3DS, which has even LESS music, but actually has people playing it and, better yet, plays well from the get-go; Tetris Friends, which is highly popular and more "family-friendly" looking; and Tetris DS, which uses an older Tetris Standard but is faster pased and more varied.\n\nPlayers who are used to the speed, technical prowess, and feel of the Grandmaster series of Tetris games will not like Tetris Ultimate in any form.\n\nI recommend this game as a Tetris game worth playing (if your comp is good enough to handle it's inefficiency), but not as a Tetris game worth $15.\n(I purchased my copy as a DL code from Amazon while it was on sale, running me $7.50.)","December 28, 2015","true","2.5"," 5 of 30 people (17%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","17","5","30","2","4"

But I can just turn off the music and play my own but its still worth mentioning.\n(I would recommend the Battle tetris gaiden OST)\n\nThere are obiouivsly a few positives too..\n\nIt does play well when you actually play, although the frame rate is locked at 60 it does runn smooth at 60 (As sad as it may sound, 60 fps it a positive when a game is from a major publisher today).\n\nThe few online games I've gotten in to have been smooth, no latency issues or anything like that (although why would there be in a tetris game)\n\nThere is quite a few costumization options you can do to change your single player experiance, turn on or of ghost, hold function, change the size of the queue, t-spins, wall kicks and even the random generation of pieces.\n\nIt keeps track of a lot of stats gameplay wise for you which is always nice to have.\n\nThere are 9 game modes, with almost all of them having online and offline components, coop, team battle etc.\n\nEven though all the flaws of this version of the game that desperately need a patch, I can see myself pouring many many more hours into this. And I can recommend this to fans, but only until there is a better Tetris game on steam.","December 10, 2015","true","5.7"," 13 of 58 people (22%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","22","13","58","2","0"

The modes are pretty good, especially with some for sadists, but it's pretty standard and you can play with up to 3 other players.\n\nOnline may need some work because lag makes it damn near impossible to play without getting boned, but it's still fun. That may just be because the game came out and there's not enough people to matchmake with good connections.","December 10, 2015","true","3.9"," 7 of 55 people (13%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","13","7","55","4","0"

I am having no issues with lag whatsoever and the modes of the game really do bring a new element.\nHowever sadly there are a couple issues, such as the game crashing frequenty when certain modes are switched on which is disappointing and I hope this is solved soon.\nAlso I am not a huge fan of the controller, controls as the hard drop button does not feel natural, would much prefer it to be on the X button or something similar as you can easily accidently shift your tetronimo to the left or right whilst trying to use the hard drop.\n\nHowever overall, although I have just started playing I am throroughly enjoying and will get many hours out of it!","December 10, 2015","true","6.5"," 7 of 57 people (12%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","12","7","57","6","0"
