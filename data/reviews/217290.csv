It's hugely replayable, as every town is different and you have to do different things to save each town (most of these are "Kill X monster", "Destroy X Machine", or "Collect X Items", but they're just slightly different enough to stay interesting).  There are some flaws in the game, the graphics are extremely dated and can be glitchy, and townspeople behave like idiots (starving to death when 1 copper piece in debt, charging towards high level invading monsters with poor weaponry and armor, standing motionless while a tornado is heading straight for them, and so on.  Worse is that you suffer a reputation penalty even when they die in stupid ways).  The monster AI seems pretty rudimentary as well, once they're aggro-ed, they run in a straight line after you and attack in predictable ways.  However, even with the flaws, it's still a solidly fun game and you can get engrossed in it pretty easily","January 29, 2014","true","119.3"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","33","38","0","0"

Played it for a few hours... pretty much addicted to it now.\n\nIt's basically Diablo or Titan Quest.  If you're already a fan of those type of games, you owe it to yourself to try this one out.  This was absolutely a thrill to play.  Everything seems to work.  The graphics are a bit dated, but by looking at the release date this is about a 6 year old game.\n\nThe loot was pretty good here as well, it was always interesting to know what each magic item's attributes were.  It's just the same as the Diablo series, it's always worth identifying your equipment in case you get something special.  It almost felt slightly crazier loot-wise than Diablo, as they would sometimes get items that Blizzard wouldn't dare give you at a low level, like gloves that add +56 damage when your weapon is only like 5-10 damage.  It doesn't even feel imbalanced or anything like that, since the difficulty ramps up quite quickly, it's just a huge bonus when you find something awesome.\n\nThere's something this game does differently which I had not seen before.  It sort of just throws quests at you like crazy to the point where you are having to find food for everyone in town one at a time.  It felt like Fallout 4 where the whole settlement needed your help, where normally in Diablo you would not have to fend for anyone but yourself, typically.  Also it seems like everyone in the town had a busy-quest for me.  Usually quite simple like killing some foes, activating a button, etc, but the fact that you have seemingly random generation on quests is something that I haven't seen from one of these types of games.  Usually the game comes with a bunch of quests and that's it.  Not so sure about this game.  Seems like they changed enough aspects of the game to make it really unique.\n\nI'd love to see if there is a multiplayer community for this game!  I see it is supported, but I haven't tried it out yet.\n\nAll in all, I'm super impressed.  Go out and buy this game!","February 8","true","6.7"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OtterA/recommended/217290/","OtterA","The Semp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OtterA/","660 products in account","Din's Curse is a game about substance over style. There are prettier, smoother, flashier action rpgs out there right now, but what Soldak brings to the table with their take on the genre is a game that can be fine-tuned and customized, providing a randomly generated town and a dungeon to protect it from. Layer on top of that systems of interactive NPCs both friendly and hostile (which works most of the time) and a class system that gives you the freedom to build the kind of character you want to play. These features and more allow Din's Curse to stand on it's own.\n\nThere is somewhat of a storyline. You (The Player Character) have incurred the wrath of Din, who tasks you with redeeming yourself by becoming a hero. It's mostly an excuse to send you to an infinite number of worlds so that you can delve into their dungeons and kick the crap out of pixies and orcs. Most of the quests in the game are randomly generated "kill x" and "fetch y" throwaways.\n\nThe way this is kept from turning the game completely stale is the way that these quests can have a tangible effect on the game world. You aren't just collecting metal shards for no reason - the townsfolk might be making an ice turret to fend off attackers. Leave an enemy leader alive too long and he'll start building an army which will overflow from the dungeon and endanger the townsfolk. It's possible for the town to become dehydrated and famished too as shipments are lost in the dungeon.\n\nThe combat can feel clunky at times. Though the game isn't terribly old the animations and hit feedback leave something to be desired. The dungeons themselves aren't particularly attention grabbing. They more or less look like a series of corridors filled with monsters to slay. Generic at best, mediocre at worst. The UI itself is the definition of clunky and there are features missing that have existed in most games like it for years.\n\nThe reason I have to give this game props is that it truly does build on its own unique concepts. I've had lots of fun delving into dungeons and gearing my character, and I love that I can go through and save a town in a matter of hours. It allows me to craft somewhat of a legacy for my character: He isn't just a guy who has done that one heroic thing. He's the savior of multiple universes!\n\nThis game will be hit or miss for a lot of people. I personally loved it, but that's because I had the patience to look past the clunky presentation to see the underlying systems beneath. It's sophisticated, but not outwardly so. If you're a fan of dungeon crawlers I'd say give it a go.\n\nI give Din's Curse an 8/10\n\n","April 1, 2015","true","18.6"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","1"

Combat has a good amount of depth and even simple melee characters have a good amount of tactics apart from "click till they drop". There are a bunch of pregenerated character classes or you can design your own, mixing & matching skill trees. I also really like the dynamic nature of the game world -- the main town can and will be attacked by monsters (it's possible for the town to be defeated entirely) and the randomly generated quests actually effect things beyond "here is a new boss to kill / item to find". It's not a game I'm likely to play for hours and hours at a sitting, but in smaller doses it's just thing, I like it better than most Diablo clones.","December 12, 2013","true","22.5"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","25","30","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Trooth/recommended/217290/","Trooth","Trooth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Trooth/","258 products in account","I really wanted to like this game. I could look past the low-poly models, the awkward texturing, the clunky animations, the garish particle effects, the simplistic UI, the bland music, and the jarring sound effects... If ONLY the game was fun to play.\n\nFor the most part, it's like any other Diablo clone you might have played. Sometimes the movements and attack animations feel kind of sluggish, but it's the same kind of point-and-click combat accompanied by a lot of randomly-generated loot, and other random factors.\n\nBut I consider that one of the biggest flaws in the game: TOO much is left up to random chance. You get a random town with random NPCs, a random dungeon with a random monster pool and a random number of floors (generally from about 5 to about 20) and you're given random quests to kill a specific monster, kill several lesser monsters, recover or destroy a random quest item, or find and/or rescue somebody from a random floor. All of which would be FINE, if the game didn't leave SO MUCH up to chance.\n\nFor example, if you get a quest to meet an NPC in the dungeon, you have to reach the floor they're on, then HOPE you find them almost immediately, because they can and will be attacked by any monsters that happen to spawn near them. And 9 times out of 10, they'll be killed by the monsters, forcing you to fail the quest. Now, failing one quest like that isn't the end of the world, but it feels like you just aren't given a fair chance, and it's one of many factors reflecting this game's lack of polish.\n\nA lot of reviewers praise the fact that you can fail any quest, any NPC can die, and you can even fail to save whatever town you're on from ruin. This isn't a bad idea in theory, but there's no way to gauge how well you're doing or how safe the town is until people start dying off and it's practically too late to help. It's true that failing to kill a "boss" enemy before an arbitrary time limit means he'll start raising minions and sending troops and assassins into the town, but there isn't much you can do to expedite that quest. It comes to a point where you're fighting a constant tide of new quests, compounded by attacks on the town, which keep you from reaching deeper floors of the dungeon, since you have to constantly return to the surface. The enemies just teleport directly into the town. It would be nicer if they had to physically travel there, so you could intercept them or cut them off, or SOMEhow take preventative action against them, but all you can do is grind along on each quest as you would normally have done. If one of my quests involved killing a boss monster on floor 15, and I was only on floor 5 or so, I would sometimes just let the monsters destroy the town and move on to a new one, because these randomly generated quests were asking far too much of me. I knew I would not only be constantly traveling back to town to kill invaders, but also that new quests in other deep floors of the dungeon would be constantly arising, just as unreachable as the first, and compounding the attacks on the town. People throw around words like "consequences" and "stakes" in praise of this game, but failing to save a town has pretty much negligible consequences. You lose some reputation and you move on to a new town. Losing one or two has no major impact on the overall game, so there's not much motivation to protect them when they're so easily disposable.\n\nAnother problem is that a town becomes "saved" after you complete a randomly-selected arbitrary quest, and there's no way of knowing which one it will be. You might kill the boss monster, break his evil altar, destroy an uprising of skeletons, recover an evil artifact, and cure the town's poisoned water supply, but none of those things might "save" the town. Instead, the game might decide that the town is "saved" when you gather items for the townspeople to construct a lightning totem in the town. There's no way of knowing what your "main" quest is, because it looks like any other random task. But all that happens when you "save" a town is that you're allowed to move on to a new one. The dungeon is still full of monsters, and all the other pre-existing quests can still be done (in fact, more will continue to spring up as long as you stay in the town) and you need not even reach the final floor of the dungeon. I found it weird when I saved my first town having only been to 10 of the dungeon's 12 floors.\n\nSo, these might be some pretty frustrating game design choices, but by far the most frustrating thing turned out to be the combat. I played as a summoning character, which I usually find fun in games like these. But the monsters' AI is so dreadful, playing a summoner is practically useless. I had my minions set to "aggressive" but they seemed to just do whatever they wanted. Sometimes they would completely ignore enemies, even as I fought them, sometimes they would attack an enemy once and then run away for no reason, and worst of all, they LOVED to stand in narrow hallways, blocking my path when I needed to escape from enemies.\n\nBut worse than that is the enemies' ability to stun you. Certain enemies with special attacks, or even ordinary enemies getting critical hits, apparently, can stun you, meaning you are 100% immobilized and unable to make any attacks or use any skills for a good three seconds. At higher levels, this is plenty of time for a swarm of monsters to surround you, stunlock you, and slowly whittle away at all of your health as you cannot possibly break through the crowd or drink potions fast enough to keep yourself alive. All you can do is sit there and watch your character slowly die.\n\nI'm perfectly fine with a game being difficult, but this game just comes across as sloppy. The difficulty is unfair and unbalanced, as a result of some very clunky combat mechanics and far too much of the quests being left up to random chance. Speaking of which, there is no real narrative or over-arching final objective to "beat" the game. Just a big disorganized pile of infinite towns, infinite dungeons, and infinite quests. I was eventually given the "gain your freedom" quest, which I took to be something a little different, signaling an "end" to the game, even though I was only about level 18. But the objective was just to kill another randomly-generated boss monster. And after I did it, nothing changed. I didn't gain an especially substantial reward, I still had my same pile of quests from the townspeople, and the game invited me to do some more of them... Forever. Even worse, actually, is that I FAILED the "gain your freedom" quest on my first attempt, and the town was eventually destroyed. But then I moved on to a new town, and the quest was immediately made available to me again. My failure of this seemingly-important quest had zero impact on my game. I just did it again.\n\nIf you're looking for a Diablo clone/action RPG/dungeon crawler, you can do a lot better, even just on steam. I'd recommend either of the Torchlight games, Titan Quest, or even Fate (a similarly unpolished-feeling game) before I would recommend this one.","December 30, 2013","false","16.6"," 64 of 99 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","64","99","2","1"

The difference between Din's Curse and any other "Diablo-like" is the nature of the quests and the dungeon itself. Quests aren't static. Enemies aren't static. NPCs aren't static. Events evolve. Failures happen. Take too long, and the bad guys gain more power and minions. The NPC you are supposed to rescue is slain. The villain in level 7 advances his plot to the next stage. People in town succumb to the a mysterious illness. Each town is a little different, and faces a different crisis. Things happen in real time.\n\nAnd sometimes, things are going so horribly, catastrophically wrong that you end up hiding inside the dungeon waiting for doom to complete its course in the city above, forcing you to teleport to the next city where you can redeem yourself.\n\nParticularly with the Demon War expansion, there are always some very interesting options. Like - instead of simply fighting the monsters invading the town on your own and hoping to kill them before they kill too many citizens, you can go around in advance and arm & armor the citizens so they can increase their own surviveability. You can also create a custom class, mixing any two ability groups that fit your ideas.  And of course, there are scads of options to challenge yourself.\n\nSo while it's got a more low-budget look to the graphics, from a gameplay perspective, this is one of the more deep, rich games of its type, and something you should definitely try if you are a fan of the subgenre. Hardcore RPG fans will find a lot more to sink their teeth into than most garden-variety Diablo-likes.","February 2","true","22.3"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

The primitive graphics are more than made-up for by the game's greatest innovation on the genre:  Everything is played on a timer, and if you take too long to complete a particular quest (or if you ignore a quest altogether) the monsters living down in the Dungeon will attack the town!\n\nIf your town is destroyed, it's game over, so the game becomes a tense balancing act as you try to do what's best for your hero while also trying to keep the town relatively intact.  The townsmen can defend themselves, and you can complete quests along the way to make it easier for them to defend themselves (e.g., "Find the blue prints for an Arrow Tower on Level 12 of the dungeon") or to give you access to better equipment (e.g., "If you can find this rare artifact on Level 3, we can recruit an Armorer to come to this town").\n\nAs with all the Diablo games, the dungeon-romp gets a little repetitive after a while.  The different classes help some with this, but not overly much.  If this turned you off in other titles like Torchlight or Diablo, there's little reason to think you'd enjoy it more here.\n\nBut if you enjoyed those games, and want something that provides a bit more of a thinking man's challenge, this is a great little game!","August 18, 2015","true","22.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The novelties it brings - randomized worlds, dynamic events, time-sensitive quests - are all extremely interesting and full of exciting potential. Unfortunately, the game never rises to meet said potential. After playing through two and a half towns I feel as though I've more or less gotten the idea.\n\nGo to a town, win and fail some quests, occasionally have to rush back to town to defend an attack... rinse and repeat.\n\nIf the dynamic events were held together by something even resembling a storyline, or some more interesting characters, this game would probably be nothing short of incredible. But as it stands - it's just another bare-bones Action RPG clickfest with a few interesting features that are borderline gimmicks.\n\nIf you know you love Action RPGs then by all means, check this one out. It's certainly not bad insofar as the genre goes. But if you were hoping, like me, for a new take on what has long ago become a worn-out genre, then think again:  at best, Din's Curse can be an interesting experiment in which you can invest a couple of hours, but nothing more.","November 28, 2015","false","4.2"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","1"

While you're doing this, any number of events within the town can occur.  For example, individuals may get in a fight; the town may be attacked by monsters; merchants may arrive with new goods.\n\nIt's striaghtforward and simple, but the real draw of this game comes from the many ways you can alter the gameplay.  There are several character classes, each with three variants, each with their own small skill trees.  You can also create a class.  As for the worlds themselves, you can determine the level at which enemies spawn, how often events occur, how often other NPC's attempt to solve quests (they can, and sometimes do succeed).  You can pay to take back stat points and skill points, allowing you to dynamically customize and re-customize your character as you're playing.  There is very little you can't directly change.  There is also the option for permadeath, if you want a greater challenge.\n\nThe DLC is absolutely worth it.  It only adds more content, and does so seamlessly.\n\nThe only downside is the graphical presentation - this game is passable, but not particularly good looking.  The UI works, but could do with having some elements closer together - on a large monitor, you might find yourself having to shift attention away from your character in order to keep track of their health, which means getting caught by surprise in some of the harder floors.  I'm not particularly bothered by it, as the gameplay is worth the occasional trouble, but if you've a very large monitor you'd probably benefit from scaling it to a different aspect ratio.\n\nOverall, I very much enjoy this game.

I'll make a case for it.\n\nThis game, to me, has all the pieces of a great roguelike / arpg game.  Instead of repeating the same story over and over, the game will randomly generate a town, dungeon, and quests for you to complete.\n\nThe really great thing about this game though, is that the world just isn't standing around waiting for you to interact with it. Villigers are starving, alpha monsters are rallying troops to attack the town. The longer you spend doing one quest, another might have been made impossible due to your target getting attacked by another mob. You might find yourself rushing OUT of the dungeon due to a raid. This randomly created world dosn't revolve around you.\n\nOnce you have sufficiantly set things right in town (or not) you go on to the next. You can set how long this should take on average in the options, It creates a really nice arcade-dungeon crawl feel that never gets old.\n\nIt's really rough around the edges, the graphics look like my cat's puke stain on the carpet and the combat gameplay while not terrible isn't really worth mentioning. But if you can allow yourself to get drawn in to the core game mechanics you may see the beauty in it.\n\nIt takes the RNG dungeon aspect of many ARPG's and applies it to the entire world you interact in, and then consolidates it into a very fun and often hectic 30 minute to an hour game.\n\nIf a more polished, refined game came out using these same mechanics, it would have the potential to be a real classic, especially for fans of the dungeon crawl, arpg or rougelike genres.\n\nSo download the free demo, give it a whirl, have some fun. Get the game on sale if you can, It can be a bitter but you might develop a taste for it.","January 21, 2015","true","16.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

While the graphics are very dated and user interface is a bit clunky at times, the game's other qualities more than make up for those shortcomings. The dynamic nature of the quests is very engaging. Townspeople may starve or that monsters may attack the town if you don't move quickly enough, and that creates a sense of urgency which adds tension to the game that just isn't present with any other game of this genre that I've ever played.\n\nThe character creation is very open-ended; the ability to select any two skill trees to create a hybrid class, and the ability to level any skill in those trees without level prerequisite skills, means that there are hundreds if not thousands of viable ways to play the game.\n\nThis is a unique game and you owe it to yourself to give it a shot.

Honestly I don't see the problem with this game.\n\nGraphics? Doesn't make a game so don't care.\n\nMonster AI? I think every game known to man could use some work on the monster AI and most people would probably judge it based on there opinion of how things should react to the player and let's not forget the glitches that can happen at random. So for this game it's not the greatest I've seen but it is good enough to be enjoyable and not to easy.\n\nDiablo Clone? Although I use this method of labeling games that fall under this genre just like Torchlight, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, so on and so forth, I hate it. Honestly it makes it nearly impossible for anyone to make a game of this style to always compare it to a predecessor who was in my opinion nearly flawless. But, I will say Din's Curse was one of the only well made games of this style to be labeled a Diablo clone. (I feel the same about Torchlight II)\n\nToo Random? You know what, no it isn't. If any gamer out there who has played Din's Curse and doesn't like the random craziness of it all that's fine, it's your opinion. Don't go calling the game sloppy for the reason that others (like me) love this game. To me it feels complete like it was meant to be ridiculous. I found this game to be quite humourus in that aspect. Seriously the first time I got a quest failed notification because an NPC died in the dungeon I realized wasting time was not good in this game and I had to stay on the ball. It keeps you on your toes. Also, it's quite entertaining to watch villagers mess around and get themselves killed cause there in debt by like a couple copper coins, or charging at high level enemies expecting to do more damage than a bee sting.\n\nThe gameplay is entertaining and keeps you busy like games are meant to. It's difficult and doesn't hold your hand a like a child unlike most games made these days, especially triple A titles. Hell, when I was 2 (maybe 3) I started playing video games, Diablo II came out when I was what 5 or 6. It's how I became pretty decent at solving puzzles and actually helped me read and write (for the most part) correctly unlike most people from my generation. So these days when they make games easy and predictable it's lame and boring I don't care how much money it's making from ignorant gamers and the layman of gaming a.k.a casual gamers, it's still a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. That's why Din's Curse is outstanding in my book. And you know what, I have a feeling that on that difficulty I only beat it because I was playing with my Cousin and our mutual friend. We loved it and I'm actually thinking of playing it again it's been awhile.\n\nSo to sum everything up, ignore the graphics play the game with your own music score in the background if you must, and maybe get a friend or two to play with you cause this game is great and don't be a whimp up the difficulty. When you've gained enough reputation to lift the curse it's like a new game+ without having to leave the game and opening the menu to start the new game. So play it beat it, and start again with the same stats, or make a new character. Hope you all enjoy.","March 10, 2014","true","12.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

There is no epic overarching storyline, but each randomized town plays differently and has stories of their own, and you can tweak the town options to personalize it to your playstyle.

He explains that to redeem yourself, you must journey with himself to towns, and in these towns you must do your best to solve all that is wrong, and save the small towns from extinsion from the demon threat below.\n\nThat is the basic idea for the game, but the execution of this game takes the cake, you can select your class, several of which are available. In each class there are 3 perspectives. For example, you can choose the Thief, who has 3 different perspectives, you can level up and persue skills in the Assassin's tree, which allows you to attack with deadly efficiency! Or you can persue the Thief tree, which allows you to sneak, pick locks, and slow the enemy!\n\nAlso, while on the subject, you are allowed to use a special *Hybrid* class, which allows you to select ANY 2 perspectives of the classes, and combine them. For example you could select a Mage perspective AND a warrior perspective, allowing you to use heavy armor and magic, and essentially any weapon you want. It adds a gread deal to the game, and the variety.\n\nAlso, the levelling system, I mentions perspectives ( and tree's a couple of times) but the levelling is free-form. So if you have the points, you can select ANY skill in the tree, top or bottom. All you need is the skill points, allowing you to grow and build your character in any way or order you want.\n\nI can praise this game in many different areas, but it's really a game to be experienced, not read about.","March 31, 2014","true","29.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

That's probably why I've got so many hours played, despite any session never being longer than 30 mintues or so. The game is dull and frustrating.\n\nDin's Curse presents itself as a dynamic, living world that continues to evolve as you do your own thing, regardless of how you play. This sounds fun until you realize that quests can become unfinishable as you're attempting to complete them through no fault of your own. Necessary NPCs in town can be killed while you're in the dungeons below. Monster spawns change as the game progresses (randomly), meaning there aren't always enough monsters to actually complete your objectives. One solution is to just wait and see if something changes after a while, but you don't get many quest slots.\n\nThe graphics are bad. Really, really bad. That might not be a deal breaker for most people, but it's definitely a mark against it. The music is mediocre, and voice acting is almost completely absent. Dialogue menus and the inventory system are even worse.\n\nCombat is a mixed bag. The class system allows you to customize your playstyle to a significant degree, but with so many options you start to realize that there's a lot of overlap. Still, the class system is probably the best reason to pick up this game. It's got a healthy amount of choices and encourages replay. Combat itself isn't so great though. Animations are awkward, weapons lack impact, and many spells trigger cave-ins that can help or hinder. (usually just hinder)\n\nDungeons are a bore, and that's all you get. There are very few changes to the scenery as you explore one dungeon after another, deep below the next randomly selected doomed village. They're randomly generated and all end up looking exactly the same.\n\nAll in all I really can't recommend the game to anyone. The game feels like something that would have been released in 2002, not 2010, but it doesn't even have that bubbly nostalgia feeling. It mostly just makes me sigh and appreciate how far good games have come.","July 19, 2014","false","14.4"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","16","31","0","1"

It's not just the game that copies its inspiration - Soldak Entertainment appear to base their company name on the leading corporation's title. Despite this blatant plagiarism, the game does have some merits although few that allow it to stand on its own. It has a dynamic world generation, and is very much point and click. If you've played Diablo then you will be able to dive straight in to Din's Curse. The one main difference is that you have better game options in DC. You can turn on different modes, such as giving all monsters more aggression, or increasing their numbers, or reducing your own chances of finding rare items. It's all good fun at first although it quickly develops into a grind.\n\nThe relentless aggression of the mobs mean that the single player mode can quickly become overwhelming. Important NPC's in the town seem to have little regard for themselves, and having no guards to protect themselves, they can easily be killed by intermittent raids. And they will. Regularly.\n\nIt seems that Steam doesn't host Diablo, and for this reason I recommend buying DC if for no other reason than that you can experience this kind of isometric point-and-click genré. However, I would be hesitant paying full price for something that is a poor imitator.","January 4, 2014","true","41.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

DO NOT BUY. I feel abused for buying into this disgusting pile of crap. If you're desperate for an underground, oldskool cult'ish ARPG like I was, then pay close attention...\nFirst off, the reviewers here are either mentally disabled or more likely associated with the developers of this crippled mess. I doubt your typical average steam-tard could possibly be *THIS* delusional when reviewing something this bad. There is absolutely nothing redeeming about the game. Format your drive, light PC on fire and throw out window if you ever manage installing software made by soldak gaming.\nTo cut things short, the gameplay is horrid. Combat is the most unsatisfying garbage to have ever existed and the UI is made of PlSS.  Nothing comes together well - placement, composition and symmetry of texts, objects, items, windows, boxes, borders, enemies, EVERYTHING is gross and the animations are more primitive than a 10 year old browser MMO written in Java (*ahem* runescape). The graphics look as if they were made by drug addicted scumbags, nothing is lovable about them. I enjoy oldskool muddy textures and crude or simplistic designs, but these graphics are just cheap.\nPerhaps the worst insult is the price. For 10$ you could save a dying african child's life, so that even he could grow up and develop something better than this on Ubuntu. I'm never trusting a game that is compatible with linux ever again. Thank you Steam.\n\nIf you're looking for a great underground hack'nslah/diablo clone/ARPG, try Sacred 1\nbut stay away from 2 and 3.\nDungeon Siege 2 is also great.","August 7, 2014","false","0.9"," 8 of 45 people (18%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","18","8","45","2","2"

Worth the investment.\nProcedurally generated content, from the town through the quests, monsters, NPCs and dungeon floors, everything's randomized. Overall it works very well, but sometimes events with negative penalties can stack, and generally make the game exceedingly difficult. Nothing that can't be avoided with some speed.","August 25, 2012","true","27.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With the exception of Kivi's Underworld--a good game in its own right but a deviation from their trademark emergent gameplay model--Soldak never disappoints.\n\nThe sheer amount of things to do in this game is mind-boggling and can literally be overwhelming.  The best part?  Each game plays out completely differently.  Lots of games boast infinite replayability--Din's Curse is the standard by which all others should be measured.\n\nIf the idea of playing alone induces a yawn, please know that multiplayer is a frenetic, exhilirating blast.  I simply cannot imagine anyone who spent a few minutes with this game not quickly finding themselves in its thrall.  And when you're ready for something familiar but new, Drox Operative, their latest title (currently in beta) s right around the corner.","August 22, 2012","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That being said, if you have friends to play with, this game can be a blast, there's a real sense of urgency as you and your freinds race to defeat the monsters base before they destroy your home town, think Diablo, but you don't have infinite time. the most impressive feature of this game though, is the class mixing, and how it seems to stay largely balanced, my personal favorite is the necromancer, but there's a lot to pick from. That being said this game is far from perfect, its greatest flaw is easily its lack of any sense of progression, sure, you may feel accomplished when you beat the boss and have saved the town, but that quickly means nothing as you move to the next one, as if everything before never happened. The game lacks a proper build up, or a "100 floors mode"\nanother thing DO NOT BUY THIS GAME THINKING YOU CAN FIND OTHER PEOPLE WHO OWN IT\nthis game is highly under rated, and you're not gonna find a lot of active games of it... thats just a sad truth, i've heard its sequal zombasite is doing pretty well, but until then your best bet would be to buy about 4 copies when its on sale or get your freinds to buy a copy of it too.\nThe DLC is pretty limited, sure it adds a lot of new enemies, but they all kinda melt into a blur anyways, the new class is neat, but adding just one new class for half the price of the original game really isn't worth it. if you're going to buy the game with the DLC, get zombasite instead of this. it includes the class and an extra one for free.","January 1, 2015","true","40.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
