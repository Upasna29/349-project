Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with getting ideas from something else and basing your ideas on it, but at least add some new mechanics. They added some mechanics and new elements to the table, but, unfortunately, they're pretty bad.\n\nFirst, there's Free For All. It's basically how slither.io already is. They couldn't even copy that correctly. The game is buggy as can be, with the hitboxes for the heads being miniscule, hitting things when you know that you weren't even touching, and sometimes being able to phase through other worms completely. One mechanic that is completely unacceptable is the fact that there is a limit on how big you can get. On a game about becoming huge, this is practically a sin.\n\nThere are some small things that make this game particularly unenjoyable. For example, when you first start the game, it prompts you to leave a good rating for the game to get 100 coins. That's a stupid way to get positive reviews for such a watered down game. Another small thing is the music. While I know you can just turn it off in the settings and play some stuff from your computer, I just have to complain about this. When you start up, you're blasted with sh-tty dubstep. You also have to make an account for this game (no, you can't connect to your Steam account like a normal game, you actually have to make a screen name and password), so that's pretty bad.\n\nBasic Overview\nPros:\nFree, small download\nSimple graphics, pretty accessible\n\nCons:\nBlatant knockoff of slither.io\nBad gamemodes\nBad dumbstep music\nSign up\n\nFinal Verdict:This game is just straight booboo.","May 4","false","0.5"," 140 of 172 people (81%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","81","140","172","19","0"

If that wasn't enough to deter you from LOOKING at this abomination of a game, it also features a forced-on free-to-play system of leveling up, skins, and PETS. Another trope that this game has is trying to give "new" and "original" mechanics. The only thing that is original about this game is being one of the worst games on Steam as of this review. This stupid worthless "game" deserves to be at the bottom of the search list when looking for Agar.io games, NOT here on the amazing, high and mighty platform known as Steam.","May 13","false","0.1"," 165 of 211 people (78%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","78","165","211","11","4"

If that wasn't enough to deter you from LOOKING at this abomination of a game, it also features a forced-on free-to-play system of leveling up, skins, and PETS. Another trope that this game has is trying to give "new" and "original" mechanics. The only thing that is original about this game is being one of the worst games on Steam as of this review.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wildkatt/recommended/466910/","wildkatt","Wildkatt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wildkatt/","735 products in account","After putting over 4 hours into the game it I've reached the conclusion that it's trying and failing to be too many things at once.\n\nThe controls go funky on me quite a lot.  I have swung my mouse to the right going straight up and it registered as a left loop, which got me killed running into someone. My dash has also been locked in the on position, making a quick boost become an uncontrollable skid into 3 other players.  I would chalk this up to a fluke, but it kept happening.\n\nThe arenas are super tiny.  While this encourages action to take place, it is so small that new players have barely any time to collect mass before having 5 other new players fling themselves at you hoping to score quick mass.\n\nVery bad hit boxes. While other games like Slither.io have a small hit box on the very tip of your snake, Worm.is's hit box is the entirety of your head. Two snakes smashing heads in a straight line, the one with the most mass automatically wins. Very frustrating when trying to make any progress in the game, since a larger worm hitting you will most likely also hit your head, in which the most mass rule applies and you pop.  So how do you kill larger worms?  By stealing from Agar.io and putting buzz saws around the arena that you can shoot mass into. After a few shots they become fly off in the direction that you hit it with.  This has worked ONCE in all the times I tried, since it has to hit the center of the head to kill the worm. Not to even mention if any other player sees you trying to do it you'll immediately be attacked since you are shooting points out of your body for them to collect. (And they will see you since as I said the arenas are tiny.)\n\nSo how do you get quick and easy mass?  My best tactic to gain 40k mass was to go along the edge for the first few minutes (since the boundaries are hard barriers and will kill you if you so much as look at them for very long) to gain enough mass to begin going into a circle and watch as other players throw themselves at me and collect  the mass as I go around. Since I won head on collisions I just sat there and kept going around until a new player spawned in with invincibility and kept his tail on my nose when it went away, killing me.\n\nChat is also questionable, since half of the chat messages were just spawned players begging the top 3 to team up so they give them mass and the other half was people complaining about newbs stealing the mass of people they killed.\n\nHunger games was a novel idea, but after waiting a half hour for a second game to load and only having 8/20 players, I gave up on playing it more than once.\n\nFinally, going back to the mass shooting... Why on earth make that the default left click?  It's a bad feature in the first place, making it what's the default dash button in Slither is just asinine.\n\nCan this game be salvaged? Loosen up the hit boxes, open the arenas a bit and remove the stupid mass shooting and it could be more fun. As it stands now? I'll just go back to slither.io","May 31","false","4.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

I went into this game already not expecting too much. As you can see I don't have much time spent in this game, I played about 15-20 minutes and that is pretty much all I could handle of it. The creators of this game also have a very awful clone of Agar.io called Mitos.is. So, this game is very clearly a port to steam from mobile, and we all know how clones of clones of clones of original games run rampant on mobile game stores, this is no exception. Though there were a couple things about this game that I liked and I will state them below in a list starting with the good.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n- Multiple Game Modes (something Slither.io does not have)\n- Apparently this game has levels, upgrades, and pets. (something Slither.io does not have)\n\nTHE BAD:\n\n- I was blasted with an ad immediately upon starting the game bribing me with coins for a rating.\n- Clear and shameless clone of Slither.io with not enough originality to make it acceptable.\n- Worse graphics than Slither.io\n- Chat... which is stupid, I challenge you to type without dying while playing this.\n- Chat requires an account with them, yeah no thanks.\n- No steam integration... you have to actually sign up with them for your own Screen Name, it does not automatically use your steam name like most other steam games.\n- Poor English, an example is when I came in second in "Hunger Games" and got a message saying "You Are Second Position"\n- Your snake/worm does not grow past a certain unimpressive size unlike Slither.io where you become terrifyingly large.\n- My ears were molested by dubstep the entire time I was playing this.\n- Hit Boxes are bugged, sometimes you will die when you feel like you made no contact, sometimes you can literally crawl right over another worm without dying.\n- The UI is messy at best, and the whole thing looks incredibly unappealing to the eye.\n\nThis game is not only an uncreative clone, but its subpar in comparison to the orginal... very very little effort went into this game period. Why steam allowed this rubbish is beyond me.\n","May 4","false","0.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

The fact that this rip-off got onto Steam bumfuzzles me. Think that this game made it onto Steam, but yet actual good games such as TubeTycoon are still struggling to be accepted. The graphics are terrible, and I'm literally offended as an avid user of Steam that this made it onto the gaming platform that we all know and love. Please don't play this game, you will be wasting precious time that you could of spent doing something else.  Playing another game? Eating a sandvich? Playing slither.io? And even though I have such a small amount of playtime in this game, it was way more than enough to decide that this game would ruin even that minute amount of my life. I should of known that I was making a huge mistake just by looking at the home page of this game. I am embarassed that I could have even 0.1 seconds of playtime on this thing. Thankyou if you have been convinced to do something better with your life, and shame on you if you still want to play this.

However, slither.io was too laggy for me, so I was never able to enjoy it. Worm.is is actually a game that my computer can run without much problem, and it has different game modes. It's a game that most computers can run, and a game that gives better replay value than it's point of inspiration. This game just recieved an update that added guilds, so now you can build an army and wage wars against other guilds. You can also play FFA, random teams, or a Hunger Games-style match with 20 or more players. The leveling system also encourages people to play more, so they can intimidate other players by getting a higher level. Gameplay is largely similar to slither, with an addition of shooting out mass to other players. Overall, Worm.is gives us one of the best rip-off titles ever. It's faithful to the source material and expands upon the concept. Give this game a shot if regular slither is just not for you or if slither is too laggy.

It needs optimized and might as well not be here on steam. It has multiple grammar errors and spelling issues (Like Ireland being spelled Irland and the warning "Your feel tired").\n\nDon't waste the 15 seconds downloading this game.

I see no difference. Okay, yes, this is a Free-To-Play gane, but you don't even need to play the game to know this is a slither.io ripoff. These excuses about "Oh, it has music!" or some other bull doesn't change that you can simply just open up your web browser and search "slither.io" to get pretty much the same experience. No music? Download something and play it in the background. This game isn't worth wasting your time on. This really makes me worry about the gaming community, not the players, but the small developers. We've seen good games made by small devs with original ideas, but this game isn't one of them.The only difference between slither.io and worm.is, is the fact that worm.is has supposed microtransactions. So long story short? The creators here seem to have the creativity of a COD playing 12 year old that doesn't like doing their chores so they end up relying on others to do their stuff for them.","May 21","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is incorrect as Slither has many server lag issues for the Europe, USA and Southern Asia server hosts whereas Worm doesn't have anywhere near that level of lag. Where people say it is Pay-To-Win, so far the only thing I have noticed that paying gets you is a new skin. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think skins will make you win. Very sleek interface with simple interaction buttons.\nOn the downside, it always has the same song playing. I would recommend having a selection of different tracks to play to make it more interesting. Also, the map size is a little on the small side.\nOverall, this is a fun game to play but needs a few more features added to make it even more diverse from Slither.\n\nP.S. #AssassinateTrump","June 3","true","6.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","1","4","2","1"

It lags less, it actually has music, there are multiple game modes and even clans. The "micro-transactions" are barely noticable, I got to 1,000 coins without spending any money (mainly from the achievement system) the skins are much better and, although you have to set up an account to store money and skins it is quick and simple.

BUT.... worm.is has alot of its own features in the game, where slither.io you would need to be on chrome and install extensions, and mostly would not be able to be found. Worm.is has Hunger games, random teams, and other good spin offs which you cant find on slither.io both games have the own aspects, if you download the game and look at the pics or trailers you will know that it has had inspiration from slither.io so why complain that is obvious, what this game gives you is a differnt kind of game. Although the graphics are not as good as slither.io, it indeed has differnt features where you can shoot out balls, like agario.

I've had over 60fps for my entire time playing and in Slither.io I only got about 30fps, and that's the decider for me to be honest.\nAdditionally, the controls in this game are much tighter. When you move your cursor, the worm moves instantly, whereas the .io worm takes a little while to react.\nLast and definately least, this game has music. Nice music. .io does not.\n\nIgnoring the other game, Worm.is: The Game is quite fun and a nice time waster. It's fun, and although you can pay money on it, don't.\nIt's better that way and you make them pay their money to let you play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WrenMeiser/recommended/466910/","WrenMeiser","WrenMeiser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WrenMeiser/","7 products in account","Despite many complaining about this game being a blatant rip-off (which it is) of Slither.io, it functions relatively well for the purpose it serves.\n\nI've dealt with very little issues regarding gameplay. I didn't note overly large hitbox, which many reviewers have stated. In fact, they're relatively fair and decently sized. What I found was a shame was that you can't really wrap yourself around other players once you reach a certain length. In fact you practically have to be on the leaderboard in order to achieve that.\n\nAlso, no, you don't need to pay for anything in order to turn the music off. Despite it being repetitive, I found the music choices to be quite fitting to the game, but that's just me. So if you like chiptunes and Amagamaguchi sounding music, there's nothing to worry about.\n\nWhat I really like is the ability to spit out a bit of your mass. I found that it's a good way to bait others to get in kills and gain mass efficiently, so the strategy is certainly there, you just need to execute it.\n\nI experienced some lag spikes as well, but they weren't frequent enough to be a huge issue for me. In fact I dealt with more lag issues in Slither.io and Agar.io than this game, so there's something to consider.\n\nIf you're looking to get this game, just like Slither.io, it's free, so the only thing you'll lose if you try this out is time and memory space.","May 16","true","1.6"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

In worm.is when you get really big, you get much fatter than you do longer, so being bigger has little to no advantage other than the ability to boost for longer periods of time without feeling the effects as much. speaking of which, boosting sucks! The change in speed you get is not nearly good enough for what you pay for it, boosting in worm.is costs you somewhere around 50 or so mass per second. Also your head turns at the just about the same speed whatever size you are unlike slither where the bigger you are the slower your head turns, which allows for stupid people to be assassinated easily, which is something I very much enjoy that is not possible here. So pretty much everything about this is worse than slither. Period, end of story.","May 6","false","0.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

When a snake dies, a random orb from its body has 5 cents. So you kill 4 snakes that didnt kill anybody and you get 20 cents, in total you have 25 cents if you die you get 12 cents, other enemy snakes search for your other 12 cents. If you add this game will become really addictive. Have a server that minimum to enter is 1 cent, 2nd server with 5 cents, 3rd with 10, 4th with 50 cents, 5th with $1, 6th with $5 and 7th with $10. So you deposit money from either paypal, debit card or SMS, choose to enter a server that requires X amount, use your skill to get money and at the end withdraw instantly.

I played worm.is first and subsequently played slither.io so I will compare both games.\n\nThe hitbox detection is much better in worm.is, with little ambiguity when you run into somebody. It never feels like you've been cheated, whereas in slither.io this is often the case as the hitboxes are smaller than the worms themselves.\n\nThere is significantly less lag and stutter in worm.is than slither.io. The ability to choose server is also nice.\n\nOne downside is that the pace of the game feels slower in worm.is, the acceleration of the worms is just not very fast. slither.io definitely feels more fast paced. Additionally, the map still feels rather small compared to slither.io.\n\nI started playing after the May 7th update, so perhaps this has fixed many of the issues which older reviews have mentioned.","May 12","true","13.7"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","14","1","7","2","0"

However, I am not going to rate it down based upon its obvious similarities to Slither. Many of the negative reviews I’ve seen rate the game poorly, simply based upon its similarity to Slither. This logic is frankly, cofounding. Yes, Worm.Is is practically a clone of Slither, however invitation to a good idea is not a reason to belittle it. Under that logic, you should never say or think anything that has been said or thought by anyone else before you, or you’re copying them.\n\nTo degrade a game, based upon the logic, “It looks like something I have seen before,” without offering any actual solid reasons for why you did or did not enjoy the game itself, is well, confounding and small minded. Think, form ideas, conceptualize. Is the game a rip off, yes, does that make it bad, absolutely not. Almost everything is a rip off of something else. “Good artists copy. Great artists steal.”\n\nThat being said, I don’t mind that the game is obviously a rip off. The game incorporates different ideas and greater complexity, allowing for many features not currently available in Slither.io. Some of these features include, team battles, the ability to add and play with your friends, actual objectives which make the game feel meaningful, purchasable skins via collection of in game currency, many more game modes and an overall improved complexity. I have played Slither, and personally enjoy the features that this game offers over that of Slither in its current state. It simply has more to offer.\n\nSome of the cons are: The detection hit boxes are very wanky and at times unpredictable, the graphics style could use some improvement, there are still many optimization issues with lag, changes need to be made to the inviting players system, the maps could use increased complexity, as well as many other bugs and glitches that those of you who play are certainly aware of.\n\nOverall, it's an enjoyable experience, and it's free...If you don't like it, then don't play it.\n","May 6","true","16.8"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","30","6","20","2","16"

Yes, I see how elements are similar between the two games. But, slither is not offered on steam, which is a very nice preference to some people with this genre of game.

Na its fine, is it good for me? Ya tis oh-kay . Is it perfect ? God no, nothing is perfect one of the many things we seem to forget these days which is I must say  a tad bit dissapointing but it is an okay game and thus shall be treated so.\n\nI hope most of you learn from this you should defnitley give this game a try.\n\n:) P.S.

Sure, let's call it a Sliter.io clone. (I've never played it because I can't stand browser games.) Just because it's a clone doesn't mean it's trash. Look at Minecraft for example, there are many clones and there are alot of people that like some clones better than the actual game. This game doesn't take long to download because of its small space, but to me it was worth it. Almost all of the negative reviews were becuase it was a clone.

It shows that games on steam can take it a step further and improve apon what was laid before, This game is truly fun and addictive, The community shows it extensive support and so do I, Just because it has microtransactions doesn't mean you have to buy them, For a better experience you don't even need them. I would honestly give this game a 10/10, This game is amazing, And free may I add. I always get into lobbys with people that are nice and care, If you die they say 'GG' which of course is a good sign, Even for a common shortcut to 'Good Game'\n\nPlease play this game, It deserves alot more credit then it actually recives.\n","May 9","true","3.5"," 1 of 14 people (7%) found this review helpful","7","1","14","0","1"

At first I thought "Oh look! Another copy.". I was wrong, this is less laggier, it doesn't take long to download and there is more than just FFA.\n\nThe only downside I think is, is the money feature. Each time you get a coin you get one or two coins, I'm not trying to say that they should get rid of coins.\n\nThe framerate isn't that bad compared to Slither.io, Worm.is is somewhere about 40 to 60 fps. Slither.io is somewhere about 5 to 9 fps.\n\nHow about the gameplay? Yes. It is like agarmods the google chrome extension, it has FFA, Teams and Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is too easy though, there should be some challenges in it like viruses make you lose more mass than you normally would, somewhere like 5 or 10 more.\nThere is a bug where sometimes go through players sometimes.\n\nThe overall game, is great.\n8.6/10","May 4","true","3.8"," 4 of 29 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","4","29","0","0"

At the moment Worm.is has a few issues that in my opinion keep me from enjoying the game as much as I could. There is lag, poor hit detection, low player base, and microtransactions and in a game like this, all of the above are pretty huge negatives. I would want Worm.is to be popular though, at least until we get a better game like it on Steam.

This game is easy to pick up, quick to download, and a blast to play. As it stands the only advantage a player can have is reflexes, everyone is equal and size means nothing. The team running Mitosis.io and Worm.io are doing a great job and im sure there are plenty of features and gamemodes in the works (I'm looking forward to hunger games and equipables). The current negative reviews are agario.io and Slither.io fanboys that are upset that an awsome game came out with similiar mechanics to thier favorite game (i dont get how people play Slither.Io, Runs like my pc is on fire for me, and the browser is horrible to play from).

This game is very close to Snake for the Nokia 3310, one of the games of the year. I'm very concerned about it's legal state, though. There is a company which seems to have leaked your game and published it before you uploaded it, i think their name is "Slither.io" or something like that.\nREAL THOUGHTS: A shameless copy of Slither.io with microtransactions. greaaaat. JUST WHAT I NEEDED.\nWAIT, there's one difference, though. It's on PC. Oh, boy. I played this "game" for 5 minutes just to write this. I now have brain damage. I eat butterflies and ticks because snakes? Oh wait, not snakes, worm.is. That's right. Worm.is a peice of crap. Also, it's "The Game", too. Was it a book before? Was it a movie about shameless browser game copies?\nMY COMPARISON: Horse crap with a cherry on top and some durian air freshener.","May 12","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a remade version of Slither.io (a remake / parody of Agar.io) that helps if Slither.io (or Agar.io, in Mitos.is' case) is too laggy when playing in a browser. Micro-transactions are implemented, but are NOT essential and only give optional things.

I then learned about slither and agar.io.\n\nWhile blatent IP theft is usually something you see on a mobile platform store, I guess it had to happen eventually on steam.\n\nOn the other hand, I can't actually play agar.io due to the horrible lag. I can't tell how good the original is since it's unplayably laggy, but I can play and enjoy mitos.is and worm.is.\n\nUntil the original games get better server capacity, I guess I'll play this steam clone. But I won't be buying any coins.\n\nThat is one small plus, the worm.is games give you plenty of game currency in the normal course of play. I've bought half a dozen skins, including the really expesive ones, just from swallowing coins during play.\n\nI'm torn about wether to give the game thumbs up or down.\n\nIf the publisher hadn't bribed me to give them a rating with free game currency, I wouldn't have known it was a rip off, and ironically would have been quite happy with the game.\n\nOn that basis, I suppose I'll give it a recommendation.
