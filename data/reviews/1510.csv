Regret always in the back of my mind for the time wasted on this. It has officially happened. I am a master hacker. Rushing through the logs deleting with the percision of a scalpel, never wasting a moment dedicated to filling my billion dollar bank account with more money. Trying to simulate the initial rush of robbing a bank. I rush in with a bounce network all around the world starting with InterNIC. I quickly start up my timer and turn on the proxy and firewall Disable tools. Brute force but neccesary for speed. It shuts off and I run the admin account I had stolen from early contacts. I'm in I copy all the accounts down, I find the prize i'm looking for. Killian Hoyal, a 967 million dollar account, a legend hidden inside of my personal gameworld. It had taken years of searching and doing favors to gain the proper knowledge to find this account. Quickly I delete disconnect from the server and rush into my log database at InterNIC, deleting all traces of my connection. Yes, I had finally found everything I would need to stage the largest bank robbery in the history of the world. From the comfort of my home. I go and make an anonymous bank account under a pseudonym. The bank is small so it wouldn't be a high priority target to search if the FBI caught onto my trail. Finally I take a deep breath, 4 minutes 11 seconds says my timer. Wasting no time I quickly connect to the bank where Killian Hoyals money is kept. Running bypasses, disablers, and all manners of illicit software designed to slow down any one looking for me, and to make sure I don't leave a trace. I log into his account using the details I found from the admin account. I go into transfer funds and make the trade to my bank account in Monrovia, Liberia. The transfer goes through. I go into his transaction logs and edit the log showing the money was sent to another hackers that had previously done me harm earlier on. I disconnect and reconnect to my account in Liberia. The money is there, perfect. I go into my transaction logs and delete the log showing the money recieved. Almost done, I connect to my home bounce and log into the logs. I delete the log showing me connecting to the banks in the first place. Just like that, his money is mine with no trace to be found of it. A job well done, I am officially.

It starts with you "connecting" to the Uplink Servers to create your new hacker identity. After a fake-but-believable-ish "boot up" you are directly connected to your remote proxy gateway, and ready for some plausibly deniable crime. This isn't real hacking, but the way the game presents itself you don't need too much imagination or suspend too much disbelief to leave an exciting doubt in the back of your mind. Easily the most immersive game I have ever experienced.\n\nThe game is completely open-ended and very complex, but approachable (There is even an in-game IRC that connects you to a real-life Uplink chatroom to talk to others in the game, if someone happens to be on it at the time.). It gives you an optional, basic tutorial risk-free on one of the Uplink Corporation's testing servers, and there are further tutorials on Uplink's main server, but after that you are left to your own ingenuity. That's a common, repeating theme of this game. Experiment, have some fun. You hacked into the social security database for your last job, what about doing it again to mark yourself as "deceased" to really become a ghost, or hack the criminal records database and put a warrant for arrest out on a server admin that made things difficult for you. In fact, the only way to "beat" this game, is to "break" it. You won't find any "questlines" or the like until you are experienced enough think a bit outside your usual targets...\n\nOne of the few games that makes missions non-linear, simply because these aren't missions, they are contracts. A deal between you and an anonymous individual working on behalf of a random company. You can go ahead and tell your employer "Nope, not in the mood, have someone else do it." after you accept the contract... for half the pay up front! (Although, good luck getting another job if your reputation is too spotty!) Perhaps someone paid you to give the guy an A, and on a whim (and after your paycheck), you put his "D-" right back. What about this investigation of corporate corruption? You have it all tied up, got your pay and everyone is happy. But you still have access to the thief's account, and for a short window of time, it's still filled to the brim with your employer's siphoned money.\nBackstab at your leisure(and peril), none of it's scripted.\n\nOn the negative side, if you look at the screenshots, that's pretty much how the game looks. You can install themes to change up the color scheme if the sharp black+blue hurts your eyes, or you just want to tell people who come over that you are hacking the matrix. Throughout the game there are very few graphic representations, and when there are the best you could hope for is an animated picture (usually just static images, though). It would be easy to dismiss these issues as "part of the experience" but that's just a cheesy way of dodging "Its a really old game, you will have to deal with terrible graphics". Admittedly, though, it IS easy to overlook the visuals, simply because its what you expect to see on some TV hacker's monitor.\n\nGameplay-wise, once you know how to do it, and get personaly experinced with it, you can get all the money you ever want within a few hours from starting and there is little replay value until you leave long enough to forget how to play. This is problematic and game length ties in directly to how good you are at it. You could beat the game in an hour and a half if you know what you are doing.\nDon't spoil it for yourself and look up how to start the ending! You will have more fun figuring it out for yourself!\n\nBeing a very old game, it also has interface problems. No scroll-wheel support being the worst offender, the necessity to have your mouse hovering over any information box you are trying to type in is a close second. Its a pain, and something to be aware of, but it doesn't get in the way of enjoying the game once you are used to it (Using the tab button is an easy fix to the second one).\n\nAt the end of the day, Its certainly worth the 10$, but should you still be on the fence about it, it goes on sale for crazy low prices. Just whatever you do: make SURE you don't miss out on this game!","October 4, 2014","true","45.5"," 117 of 122 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","117","122","3","2"

As an example, the IRC program inside doesn't run well with current IRC security protocols (it /does/ connect to real servers.)\n\nBut that doesn't mean this is a hell of a good game and still pretty much one of a kind.\n\nThis game takes inspiration from Hollywood hacking and turns it into an excellent simulation of such. A sandbox roguelike of sorts, you need wits, some planning, and a little luck to become rich, powerful, and save the internet from some bad guys that feel it's time to unplug everything.\n\nI believe Introversion could make a new Uplink with the skills they've gained from the games they've created since 2001, and release something truly golden. The market for hacking simulations is pretty much dominated by this decade old game, something more 21st century would most definitely be a hit.\n\nUntil then, enjoy Uplink, and good luck on the net.","May 26, 2014","true","17.8"," 70 of 71 people (99%) found this review helpful","99","70","71","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rancourt/recommended/1510/","rancourt","Dusty Rancourt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rancourt/","2088 products in account","This is really everything I wanted from an indie hacking game. It is a vast and glorious sandbox brimming with opportunity. To tell its tale, let me start the story about twenty-five years ago, with a little gem from Interplay called "Neuromancer."\n\nNeuromancer was an amazing piece of work, for its time. A point and click adventure game, yes, but with a vast collection of BBS-like "sites" in "cyberspace," which could be accessed and navigated spatially, a sea of semitransparent polygons on a sprawling grid. They called the book "prophetic" in its vision of what a global computer network might be like, but the game was similarly visionary, in that it offered a classic milestone-and-unlocked-door-driven main story, but with a vast and layered world of enriching side stories and tiny details easily overlooked, that add depth and character to the world in which your character lives. This was a level of detail and nuance and supporting gameworld-enrichment that Bioware would go on to become famous for, in its epic D&D games of the Nineties, and in its later adventure games, but in the Eighties, on computers that were much more limited in resources, this was a bigger feat, and a bigger surprise to the player. You could just play Neuromancer to win it, or you could play it to learn about it, follow the exchanges on the PAX and on private sites, the private message exchanges between AIs. You could learn so much more that way, if you were clever and patient enough to retain it, to piece it together, and to make sense of it all.\n\nIt had its limitations, though. For all that supplemental-story richness, hacking was extremely primitive and frankly, rather RPG-combat-like. There wasn't much finesse to it, and though there was some pressure to stay alert and focused, it lacked the sweaty-fingers-and-hurry-hurry-hurry aspect we associate with computer crime.\n\nNow here's where Uplink steps onto the scene.\n\nUplink isn't a classic RPG -- whether or not it's an RPG at all is a very good question, and I'm not sure how to address the question without spoilers. The game starts very simply; you're a hacker with a server in a colocation facility, and through it, you can access the internet. Your employer offers you access to a database of open hacking jobs commensurate to your demonstrated ability and toolkit, and you can carry them out for money. For many people, this is the entire game of Uplink -- choosing jobs, carrying them out, getting paid. It's fun stuff! The clock is always ticking. Traces are run to try to find you. You've got that sweaty palms, twitchy-taut-nerves, GO GO GO GO GO adrenaline headspace, typing and tapping and trying frantically to get the job done and wipe logs before you're traced and busted.\n\nBut why stop there? What I feel I can safely say without spoilers is that the game is very much a sandbox, and as your means grow, you find yourself able to make decisions about the nature and purpose of your work. Who you work for, why you work, what work you do and don't do, and what you're after will determine what the game looks like, to you.\n\nA rich and detailed world sprawls before you, full of interesting things to learn, do and find. Curiosity is rewarded. Tinkering is rewarded. Ingenuity is especially rewarded. There is a "master story," but whether or not you ever even encounter it -- well, that's up to you.\n\nThe game uses a very retro interface style; it reminded me of the turn-of-the-millennium retrofuture aesthetic, and made me nostalgic for the days of multiple Unix flavors on huge proprietary hardware. Be sure to be very, very glib with your mouse skills; fast accurate clicking is a must. A touchscreen system with a keyboard would probably be ideal, but rest assured, this Uplinker runs just fine on his non-touchscreen laptop. Speed is critical, a cool head and the ability to systemically run through a list of easy but specific tasks with a ticking timer is also critical. If you don't like to be under pressure, Uplink isn't for you.\n\nIf you're looking for great visual beauty and visual exploration as found in, say, point-and-click adventure games, look elsewhere. You'll spend all your time in Uplink staring at a virtual desktop environment. Some people will find that thrilling -- I'm one of 'em! -- and some will surely be put off by it. Uplink also enforces consequences beautifully; really bad decisions will even wipe your savegame, be warned. (Can you back it up sneakily and restore it? Yes, yes you can, you...cheating hacker, you.) But most of all, if you're looking for a game that makes it easy to understand what you're supposed to do, this is utterly not the game for you. Uplink's as silent and as uncommunicative as a bash prompt, and that's why it's perfectly suited to the right kind of oldschool-hackerly mind.\n\nYou've probably formed a strong opinion of Uplink already, just from what I've said. Good. If you're the sort who loves this sort of thing, Uplink is the game you've been waiting for, and there's nothing quite like it. This is what Neuromancer wanted to be like, I think...and might have been, but for that its dreams of electric sheep were limited in resolution and framerate by its era.","February 9, 2014","true","15.4"," 68 of 70 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","68","70","2","0"

Where do I start?\nIt’s got such great game-play; it was inspired by Hollywood hacking scenes where the character or antagonist rapidly types at keys in vain hope to cause lots of damage. And given its base, it fulfils it well. It has high passed action scenes where you’re screaming at your screen to rapidly crack the password while trying not to get caught. Who says that you need the latest 3D graphics to engage someone in a game? I mean yes Battlefield 4 looks pretty but it will never be able to tell a story like Thomas Was Alone. If you can look beyond the dated graphics then you’ll see a great game. I think it was such a great first game for Introversion and can’t wait to see how Prison Architect turns out to be!\nOverall, I think that everyone should give this classic ago, grab it while it’s on offer.

From your terminal you'll receive missions, install new software, and try to sneak undetected into the digital infrastructures of some made up mega-corps.If you want to get in and out undetected you'll need to bounce your connection around the world, crack passwords with decryption programs, and delete any trace you've left of your time stealing business secrets and changing personal information.The game hides its mechanics behind a veil of realism. There's no pause button, and plenty of typing, emails to read, and bank accounts to create and manage.In fact, if you turn off the techno soundtrack it's easy to pretend you really are a movie hacker, diving through firewalls as you try and pull off the perfect digital heist from the comfort of your tablet.The game punishes mistakes with swift retribution, and the fictional company that you're working for is quick to disavow your actions and kick you back to the bottom of the pile if you're caught poking your nose somewhere it doesn't belong.Watching a trace creep ever closer to your location can turn even the simplest of hacks into a frantic race against time. The problem is that those moments of real tension are few and far between, and more often than not you'll complete a job without batting an eyelid. Things get repetitive, too, and while you'll unlock new hacking methods as you progress the back doors you use to sneak into systems are always basically the same.Uplink is clearly a labour of love, and if you enjoyed the original you'll feel the same about this version, but newcomers will likely find the slow pace and esoteric style a little off-putting.","December 6, 2014","true","13.4"," 53 of 56 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","53","56","0","2"

In this realistic hacking game (yes, that exists), you will probably lose at least three or four times before you even reach the top-10 list (you start at 20-something). Then you'll lose again because you forgot to delete you logs properly that *one* time.\n\nThis game's fun is not about the excitment of hacking into secure systems and performing movie-geek-like feats. Most of the hacking is done by automated scripts, and your sole job is to make sure you don't get caught.\nThat's where the fun lies. Being methodical, precise and never allowing yourself to make a single mistake. Give the feds a single opening, and they'll be on you faster than you can say "♥♥♥♥, did I forget to erase my logs?"\nMy most recent run ended when I stole one million (a lot!) credits from a bank. I did everything with scalpel precision: I erased my logs, deleted the transaction from the target account... And I lost as soon as I realized I'd forgotten to delete the transaction from my own account.\n\nSo if you're wondering about buying this game, yes. If you're not against slightly repetitive gameplay and the fact that you will die, Get this game and enjoy it as I am.\n\nStay vigilant, don't breathe until after your tracks are fully covered and, whatever you do, never get sloppy.","April 20, 2015","true","52.2"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","16","17","3","0"

[*NOTE: This is not a command prompt hacker, like other games, it's a simple, yet comlicated, easy to use, hard to master, point and click.]\n\nYou start off by registering as an "Uplink" agent. Fancy words for freelance hacker. You select a Gateway, in one of many large popular cities. New York, or Chicago to name two of them. I usually choose Chicago. Then, once you've done that, you connect to the Gateway and are turned loose on the world. Uplink has an internal server you can connect to in the games server list. This is where you'll buy new programs for youre hacking needs, or new hardware for youre Gateway. I'd highly recommend buying a lvl 1 password breaker, lvl 1 trace tracker, and lvl 1 Log deleter. The trace tracker isn't very efficiant. You can upgrade it later by completing missions and buying it. There's a mission list in the internal service too. If you need money or just bored. [*Note you need reputation to accept these things. You can get basic rep by completing the tutorial.] You can hack just about every server and cause comlplete chaos. You can even hack into banks and run off loaded. Just be cautious, one small slip up is your doom. This is just the short version. If you want more try this yourself.\n\nEnjoy Uplink a cool hacking game, and remember Agents, Trust Is A Weakness.

The learning curve is pretty steep and will require some online research in order to understand and play the game properly.  The text is also hard to read and strains the eyes over time.  This is probably due to that fact that it is a 13 year old game and isn't properly optimized for HD monitors.  Anyways, outside of that, it is a very well thought out game that actually becomes a little addicting.  The storyline has a few different endings and you can decide to play along or ignore them all together.  The HUD and music are extremely dated which adds to the whole experience in such a great way.

All of this creates a tense atmosphere during an attack, and while some may find it offputting, I found it to be incredibly immersive and enjoyable.\n\nIf you're at all interested in network security, fictional or non-fictional representations of hacking, then you're going to love Uplink!\n","July 10, 2015","true","17.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CheersLove/recommended/1510/","CheersLove","Stargazer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CheersLove/","176 products in account","*~I've rewritten my entire review, as my last one was lackluster.~*\n\nUplink is a fairly interesting game, unlike any other I've played before. Uplink is a game where you assume the role as an agent of Uplink; a company with hackers(crackers) for hire. Simply put, you take a job, do the job, and get paid. While it sounds simple, there's much more to it than just going in, doing something, and it's over, especially when you start taking on more difficult jobs.\n\nA majority of the gameplay consists of, as stated above, taking jobs from one of the many companies in the game and executing the desired task(s). There are many different types of jobs, all of which have their own difficulty. Jobs range from attacking a system to copy or delete one or two files to copying or destroying entire databases, attacking company LANs, cracking into bank systems and much more. You may also fuel your own desires, and perhaps crash the global system.\n\nWith the money you collect, you're able to upgrade your hardware and software. Hardware consists of the gateway *The case*, CPUs, memory *Serves as storage*, the modem, and security, all of which, excluding memory and security, have different "levels". Upgrading your hardware lets you complete tasks faster, store more data, and avoid going to jail if you ever make a little mistake and the police come to confiscate your gateway.\n\nWhile it may not be clear at first, you will eventually become involved in the story of Uplink, which comes with drastic decisions and results. (No spoilers here)\n\nMods for Uplink exist, and while there may not be many compared to other games, there are a fair amount ot custom skins and gateways. Modding the game is very simple as well, and anybody with a painting program can make a mod for Uplink with no extra software required. While most mods may be skins, there is a completely separate game (mod, if you will) called Onlink, which is Uplink with much much more content added.  I suggest checking out Onlink for yourself, and looking at how much more it adds.\n\nThe layout of the game is fairly simple, and reminds me of Windows 95 - 2000. When playing the game, I recommend playing at a resolution of 1024 x 768 or lower. A lower resolution makes for a better experience in my opinion, as text may be harder to read on bigger resolutions, and the game is from 2001, thus the GUI is designed for smaller screens. The game is perfectly functional at bigger resolutions, however. As for hardware requirements, you should have no difficulty playing Uplink, unless you're running a system with the minimum requirements for Windows 2000.\n\nThe gameplay of Uplink may seem repetitive to some, especially after finishing a game or two. While it can be repetitive, most of the repetition is during the early stages of the game, and as you get better equipment, you have many more jobs to do, thus alleviating the early repetition. As for a downside to gameplay, *potential spoiler*  you're never told how to delete access logs, which are files left on the comptuers you bounce your connection to in order to refrain from having companies directly identify who you are. In order to stand a chance in the mid-to-late game, you must know how to delete your access logs from the first comptuer in your bounce connection. I learned the hard way.\n\nI definitely recommend Uplink, especially on sale for $2.49. It's a game where you get to live the fantasy of being a hacker in an action-packed way.","July 13, 2013","true","66.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

(This can be remedied by incrementally copying the game save to another directory, and if you mess up, can be copied back over- just a tip :) ).\n\nI thorougly enjoyed the game, the ending was good (although from what I remember- not super surprising), and they progress you from not very hard hacking into complex multi subnet and private network hacking (the most fun parts!).

It is novel and superficially well-done, but after I played for an hour or so, the novelty wore off and I was left with a lot of flawed and confusing game mechanics.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Very immersive. The game does a nice job of making you feel like the main character. In fact, it almost feels like you are a real hacker at times.\n+ Good sense of gradually building yourself up from scratch. There is a certain satisfaction in upgrading your programs and computers step by step.\n\nCons:\n\n- A lot of aspects of the game are very poorly explained. Once you get through the basics, you have to look everything up on the internet because what the different hacking programs do and how/when to use them is very unclear. Several times I literally didn't know what I was supposed to be attempting in a mission.\n- Poor mission variety makes the game very repetitive. Add to this the fact that a given mission can be completed exactly the same way every time you get it. Mission are fun the first one or two times you get each one, but then just become a chore.\n- The game mechanics are very susceptible to tricks, loopholes, and exploits. This is the type of game that seems very hard until you figure out a couple of little tricks that make it painfully easy. Then it just becomes a repetitive grind of using the same tricks over and over. I'm honestly not sure if several of the techniques I used were the intended mechanics of the game or were game-breaking oversights.","January 27","false","2.7"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","17","28","4","0"

Let me just start. I have got a copy, but it was not bought. I played it alot, and decided i would buy it. I bought it on a site that gives games for cheaper, and oh boy. Am i enjoying myself.\nYou start as a bad/good/expert/terrible/mediocre hacker. This really depends on how you play the game, but the game is very simple. You see you joined some hacking group/freelance hacker center. You do a quick tutorial. Even the tutorial can be done in a few different ways. Buy password breaker for a longer, but more effiecent entry. Buy dictionary hacker to be quicker, but you might need to use the program a few times. You go to the software shop, with tons of stuff you cant buy. The game tells you to buy trace tracker and password breaker. So, now after the tutorial, you start playing. You do some quick missions, because they are similiar to the tutorial. Some might buy useless software that is not needed. The tutorial is kinda vague, but eh. After a few missions, you notice the game is fun and addicting, and very simple at its core. You slowly evolve, sometimes looking up tutorials, and realise your toaster  gateway wont do. You grind, thats what i dont like in this game. You gotta grind sometimes, but that is just a nitpick. A agent dies, the storyline starts. This game actually has a good story, it really surpised me. The game is really good.  You can hack goverment, companies, etc. Now much to say, its great, its really fun, the story is great. The story is well, agents from Uplink are working for arc, making SOMETHING. The top agent in Uplink [Or the 2nd, 3rd, etc, if you use a tactic you can get number 1 rating and grade 6-5 rank in 2 missions] has been found dead. You receive a email. I cant say anything that wont go into spoiler land.\nEZ PZ 2 LEARN HARD 2 MASTER\n\n\nOverall:\nSoundtrack - 5/10 Not my taste. Will not effect ending rating.\nGameplay - 10/10 as simple as it may be, its great.\nStory - 9.5/10 Good story, but yknow, it cant be much because of the games design\nDesign - 10/10 As simple as the game is, its great. Its just so visually pleasing for me.\nReplay value: Infinite. Not much to say.\n\nOVERALL: 10/10 Even if it is over 10+ years old, its fun. It has aged well. Best hacking game ever. I loved Hacknet, but when i discovered Uplink, oh boy, hacknet seems like the worst hacking game ever.\nUplink kicks hacknets ♥♥♥. Hacknet does not have replay value, only has a few routes, the story in it is okay, and i dont like the soundtrack. This is just my ♥♥♥♥ing opinion so dont splatter me with rage, fans of Hacknet.\nUplink. Buy it.

Especially when you were JUST about to complete that one [SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!] ARC mission which involves you hacking Darwin's LAN and then the SysAdmin is like "Nah breh, your IP is mine breh.". I hate it when that happens, but let's get to Pros and Cons.\nPros:\n- Story is excellent, I love it like it's my child.\n- Isn't a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DOS console game, unlike a specific game *cough cough* Hacknet *cough cough*.\n- IS ACTUALLY FUN! IT'S ♥♥♥♥ING FUN! WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?!?!?\n- "10/10 would r8 10 again" - IGN 2015\n- You can pick a side to be with. Either [HUGE ♥♥♥♥ING SPOILER HERE!] save the Interwebs, or destroy it.\n- Getting dunked on by San- wait, wrong game.\n- Getting dunked on by that one spare log.\nCons:\n- Some text is too small to read.\n- You complete a mission but you don't get paid because of a bug.\n\nOverall, Uplink is a great game, so I wish you all luck with hacking, because it's a pane in the glass.\n","April 19","true","30.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Cover your tracks well, or the FBI (or even other hackers!) will find you and shut you down.\n\nThis game evokes paranoia like nothing I’ve ever played before.  The simple UI and relatively simple mission structure leaves you with a false sense of security.  Fail to delete logs of your hacks, leave a trail of breadcrumbs, and the government or a rival corporation will find you.  When they do, its game over.  All your hard work destroyed instantly.  If you want to keep playing, you’ll have to restart from the very beginning.  Yet this failure is not instantaneous.  You’ll have time to run other missions and you’ll think that you are safe, when in reality, the noose is tightening ever so slowly.  And there’s nothing you can do about it.  There are no take-backs in the world of hacking.\n\nYou should always route your connection to your target system through as many other servers as you can.  This will give you time to perform your hack, as well as shield you from investigation.  You can delete logs from any system along the chain and you’ll effectively be untraceable.  But you have to be fast.\nSlowly you’ll gain expertise in how to infiltrate different systems.  Banks are more secure than academic databases, and corporate mainframes have different security measures from public servers.  You’ll need lots of different software tools to manage each of these challenges, which Uplink Corp. will happily provide you.  The downside here is that you’ll never know exactly what you’re going to need before you run into it.  In a game that requires perfection, forcing you to learn by trial-and-error is a little annoying.\n\nThe main storyline about an impossibly-strong  computer virus is engaging, but rather short.  Most missions fall into about 10 different types, which get a little repetitive once you are know how to tackle each one.\n\nUplink is really interesting, though slightly flawed.  This is THE game that anyone aspiring to be a movie hacker should play.  Fight against the clock to steal valuable secrets and leave no trace of your presence.  Paranoia will be your constant companion in this one.  If (or rather, when) you do get caught, it will be no one’s fault but your own.","April 5","true","10.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You'll love it, you'll hate it, you'll feel evil.  Great game!\n\nI have played this game for a much longer time than my time on Steam indicates.  I first found out about this game on the abandonware site "Home of the Underdogs", which is still up and running and worth taking a look at.  Anyway, Uplink caught my eye as being one of the "Top Dogs" and in the Hall of Fame.\n\nI completely agree with that evaluation.\n\nSome of the people who are reading this may remember playing the game "Hacker" by Activision about 30 years ago.  That game was intriguing as there was no intro screen, nothing, just a blank blue screen requiring you to log in to a system you've hacked into.\n\nUplink is the Hacker of a new generation, but exponentially better.  If you are not familiar with the world of hacking or even how basic modern computer systems work (and I am one of those people), then the learning curve may be high.  But once mastered, the game is a thrill and a sh*t-ton of fun.\n\nYou don't have to follow the narrative story that the game puts in front of you.  There are always more missions available that don't move the plot forward.  If fact, I found the essential "sandbox" piece of the game more fun than the "story-mode".\n\nThis game allows you to experience the complete psycopathy that a hacker can posess without having to risk the alternatives, such as decades in a federal prison.  You can use your powers for good if you want to.  But I think that it's clear, in movies and in literature going back centuries -- being evil is more fun.  So take that mission to break into a competitor's server and disrupt it.  Or steal their files and erase it even when you aren't being paid to.  There are several "headlines" that appear on the home screen that give you a nice little chuckle to let you know you've succeeded.\n\nEventually, the sandbox mode (like with all sandbox modes) loses its challenge.  THis is because you've mastered everything, bought every possible piece of computer equipment and security pieces, and have hacked banks so many times that you have so much money and don't need any more.\n\nBut that's like every game.  Just in writing this review it gave me motivation to return to this game after a couple of years.  Sorry if I take your bank down.  Trust me, they deserved it.  Or not.","January 10","true","7.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The academic place gives you like 200-300 seconds, so those are relatively safe.\n3) Log Deleter - Get the highest version, and delete your logs from interNIC after every mission.\n4) HUD connection Analyzer\n5) Proxy bypasser\n\nAt this point, its possible to hack bank accounts if you are very, VERY fast, which will give you plenty of money for anything else.

Always save for the highest version, and buy stuff in the following order:\n1) Password Breaker - unable to do anything without it.\n2) Trace Tracker - You can avoid getting this until a little later (level 4/5 missions) if you simply assume that you have exactly enough time to do the job and no more.  The academic place gives you like 200-300 seconds, so those are relatively safe.\n3) Log Deleter - Get the highest version, and delete your logs from interNIC after every mission.\n4) HUD connection Analyzer\n5) Proxy bypasser\n\nAt this point, its possible to hack bank accounts if you are very, VERY fast, which will give you plenty of money for anything else.  Make sure you delete bank records of transfers/deposits and logs from interNIC.  You have like 1 minute to hide your tracks on both banks and interNIC.","December 31, 2010","true","27.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even at full price I wouldn't of been dissappointed as this game has so much depth to and is so much more "realistic" than any other hacking sim out there. Yes the game is hard, and it has "perma death" so if you're caught then thats it. Game over. Unless you have security, but thats another story for another day. However once you've been caught and had to re start a couple of times you get the hang of things and then the fun really begins.\n\nThe adrenaline rush you get when you're trying to disable a proxy with only 40 seconds on the trace left before you are caught and you succeed and manage to clear all trace of your being there and disconnect with 4 seconds left is second to none.\n\nAnother great thing is when you launch the game there are no logos or anything to suggest that this is actually even a game.

However, to get this I had to buy a more exensive pack. This pack contained Uplink.\n\nUplink is not a casual game, neither is it competitive. It is a challenge. Failure is met with a complete wipe of your save file, unless you're cheeky enough to copy it from the Uplink folder. However, ultimate success is met with extreme satisfaction. You'll not beat the game on your first run. Neither on your second, third or fourth. When you lose, you MUST learn from your mistakes and think "How did I mess up this time?" Eventually, you'll hack that bank and steal millions. Eventually, you'll find the secret of compromising that Local Area Network. Eventually, you will succeed in your final quest, whether you side with good or bad, Arunmor or ARC, Faith or Revelation.\n\nTL;DR\nThis game is a brilliant, tense and puzzling hacking simulator. I sincerely recommend it.\n\n\n\n\nIf that doesn't sound too good, you can force people into jail for having an extravagantly long beard.","September 29, 2015","true","24.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Take that with a grain of salt.  I know that's not how it's done...but it's miles better than most of the crap that comes into popular culture about hacking.\n\nRemember Hackers?  God...what a mess.  Stupid GUIs that couldn't exist at the time.  Looked like people were typing into their screen savers.  Even a young Angelina Jolie couldn't save that turd of a movie.  Usually when Matthew Lillard shows up, you know where you're movie is going with regard to public opinion.\n\nTL;DR- Better than Hackers.  If you enjoy mostly text-based games and don't need *PRETTY SHINY* things to have fun with games, pick this one up.\n\nBut don't watch Hackers.  Seriously.\n\nOr I'll run an oil tanker aground...\n\nWatch Blackhat or something.  I know it's Thor pretending like he knows something about computers...but it's till better than Hackers.

Made by famous Introversion Software it is also the first game they made.\n\nI really like the way hacking is simulated here (no need to type in the same stupid commands over and over again), the depth of the story, the possibilities the game gives you, the way the interface works and the eastereggs and humor within the game. In the original version there were also things hidden outside of the game, e.g. on the CD, the bonus disk and the manual. man "Uplink Game Bible".\n\nAs my dev-CD of Uplink broke some years ago I seized the chance to get a working Uplink via the steam sale again. Unfortunately the Multi-Monitor option is not available in the steam version of the game and cannot be activated (which can be done in the original version although it was officially removed there, too). Playing Uplink on several screens (all showing different game-related data) is even more movie-hackerish.","March 19, 2015","true","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/1510/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1777 products in account","Uplink is a very interesting game that fills a much needed gap in genres. Hacking simulation games are rare, and this one fulfills that need beautifully. You are placed in front of a terminal from the very beginning. The tutorial helps you get started without any problems, and once you complete your first few missions, you will understand how to use the basics. The music gets a little repetitive after many hours of play, but does not become a distraction or an annoyance. If you prefer, you can turn it off in the settings. The complexity of Uplink comes from the various missions as well as the many hardware and software changes and upgrades you are allowed to make. Some of the early missions can be a bit confusing, but after a few tries you realize what you did wrong, and will be able to complete them without any problems. The setting of the game is somewhat futuristic but manages to keep facts into perspective as well as keeping all aspects of the game realistic for such a simulation. There is much reading to be done in the form of bulletin boards, viewing items, and reading mission details. Making the video resolution too high will make the fonts too small to read, which makes things tough for the eyes. As the difficulty of the missions ramp up, you are basically left on your own to figure out how the game works, and what you need in order to be able to attempt missions. This can be frustrating and can possibly leave the player feeling almost completely lost. It is often very difficult to understand what tools one needs for the various jobs you have access to, or how to go about correcting some of your mistakes. I suppose Uplink is keeping its simulation genre up to standard, as a real life hacker would probably go through the same hurdles and difficulties for learning about such activities, which can certainly take much time and many errors to master. Getting caught, losing everything, and being forced to end your career early as a hacker is heartbreaking, and gives the impression that you are playing a roguelike. Getting help from a FAQ or guide is almost a requirement. As you complete the missions, you rarely feel safe. It almost feels like at any time, you will get caught and have to restart the game with a brand new character again. The more advanced missions are so complicated, involved in minute details, and difficult to complete, that I don't think there is any way to go about them by trial and error. Once again, a FAQ or guide is an absolute necessity. Worse yet, if you make a ridiculously small mistake in the very first part of the story mission, you will have to start over from the very beginning if you want to do more than the non crucial missions and proceed through the storyline. The player is not allowed to save and reload games at all. Starting from the beginning multiple times because of small mistakes means that you will be throwing away dozens of hours until you get it right even once. This problem of having to restart the game from the very beginning, in conjunction with the lack of variety in the missions makes for somewhat of a disappointment. Even then, Uplink can be enjoyed in short bursts, and is a good choice to go back to every now and then, by keeping it installed for the long run. It is also valid to mention that for its age, Uplink has accomplished plenty. It is a complex and complicated hacking simulation to be enjoyed by those who are patient and don't mind a steep learning curve.\n\nUplink is okay.","March 20, 2014","true","14.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While I did, to my surprise, really enjoy Hacknet's cmd line use, I figured the point and click method of Uplink would be less of a hassle... Honestly I found this really, really tedious. I'm completely confused by the fact that after upgrading some of my software, trying to tweak the task master a bit and even using more nodes to bounce off of, I was somehow traced EVEN FASTER by same (LOW) level companies as before.. Just a very frustrating start. Well plenty of other people seem to dig it so I guess I just didn't get it. Glad I bought it on sale for only a couple of bucks and maybe I'll take another stab at it in the future with fresh eyes, but for now I just can't stick with it\n\n[Edit] I forgot to mention: I'm not sure if the tutorial portion is buggy or what, but it didn't show me how to do quite a bit of the basics (i.e. how/where to buy and install software). I had to stumble upon most of it.. it wasn't until I got so frustrated I looked up a video walkthrough and noticed the poster's tutorial had way more to it than mine","November 1, 2015","false","2.0"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","22","2","9","2","0"

I mean, how bad could it really be?\n\nImmersion and gameplay -\n\nAfter completing the tutorial mission, I wondered, "Ok, now what?"  There is no plot (zero, none, nothing, NULL) to this single player game which begs the question, "Why am I playing this?"  You will spend your first few hours going mission to mission using the exact same password crack, browse files, delete logs.  Over.  And over.  And over...  Then there's the constant BEEP, BEEP, BEEP.  It makes the game tense because you feel like your teeth are getting drilled.  And just like in real life, you have an email inbox full of auto-replies and junk that you have to try and sort through trying to find the file name your supposed to look for on the stupid repetative mission while BEEP BEEP BEEP!!!!!!!!!!\n\nAudio visual atmosphere -\n\nThe audio and visuals of the game are non-existant.  You'll tell yourself "that's ok, because I play all kinds of indie 8-bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t."  Just don't.  Please.\n\nControls -\n\nI would describe this game as OS hell.  The interface is absolute torture. If you actually do any programming, scripting, hacking, or even just know your way around a real OS, the fact that you CANNOT ACTUALLY USE THE KEYBOARD most of the time will make you want to immediately delete this game.  Instead you have to click around through the minimalist interface of indeciferable buttons.  Image everything you hate about computers, ok, now step in a pile of dog ♥♥♥♥, and that should get you in the ball park of what this game is like.\n\nSummary -\n\nIt's like your parents asked you to fix their computer, you know, find the "funny email thing" they downloaded 10 times but can't find it, only you have to use the mono-chromatic interface from a Nokia brick phone circa 1999 while some one is shreiking in your ear periodically and hitting you in the balls wiht a hockey stick.  If you are still thinking you want to play this game, just go put your head in an oven, and slam the door repeatedly whilst the broiler is turned on.","December 19, 2013","false","1.7"," 7 of 29 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","7","29","0","0"

I wish, with all my heart, they'd have made an Uplink 2. I first got a free copy of this game to try it out. When I did, I also found out that the devs had finished with it and that no more would be done. After playing the game I was seriously interested in buying it to let the dev's know I really appreciated and loved the game. But it no longer mattered. I had come to the game way too late. As I said, they had quit developement. When I seen it on Steam I just HAD to have another go at it. So I bought it yet again.\n\nI know the tricks and such to having a blast with the game. Usually I don't even come close to getting caught. lol I just finshed yet another play and I got caught this time. I had found 4 seperate bank accounts with over 500k in each. For a total take of 3.9 mill. lol I got greedy and sloppy. I bought me a system with 1 security slot and installed a nuke. So I needn't have gotten caught. But i thought I'd have time to transfer all 4 accounts to my 3rd bank account with no worries. I was in the middle of the second transfer when I my screen went black.... For a moment I thought I had finally found a bug. Then the notice about getting caught came up. I was sooo ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Now I'm smiling an laughing at it all.\n\nThe game is nothing like real life hacking, I'm sure. But it makes you FEEL like your accomlishing so much and being sooo very slick or sneaky.\n\nAs i said, I LOVE this game.\n\nIf the above sounds in the least bit interesting, I highly recommend getting this title.","January 15, 2015","true","34.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Uplink is an exaggerated hacking simulator, inspired by how hacking is protrayed in movies.  It is a minimalist game in that it is very text-heavy, it requires typing, and there aren't a lot of visual things going on.\n\nBoth the great part and the frustrating part of these kinds of sims is the depth of what you're doing.  Here, you have to accept or decline jobs, buy and upgrade software while managing your storage space, order hardware upgrades, keep track of IP addresses, plan server jumps and cover your tracks.  It might not be close to real hacking, but it certainly can be fun.  Also the game puts you in a hacking community, where reputation is important and your actions can have severe consequences much later.\n\nBut like so many of these types of games, which were more popular in the 80's and 90's, it is a bit tedious.  I find it vital to keep a paper and pen handy for notes.  Many essential things (like knowing when to connect to InterNIC and which logs to delete and not delete) aren't explained, leaving you to figure them out.  And you probably won't.  And there are occassional bugs, apparently, where missions cannot be completed.\n\nI like this game.  It's fun, but it's not the kind of thing you can just jump in and play.","December 2, 2014","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The techno soundtrack is also very engaging and fits the game experience perfectly, The game's UI might take some time to get used to, but it's straightforward once you 'get' it.

In most jobs you have a certain time to finish whatever you're doing, or you'll get traced, and your save file is lost if you get caught. You also have to cover up your tracks or you'll get caught eventually (a day or two after the job).\n\nPros: Lots of pressure during the jobs, this game can really get your heart beating; It's fun to upgrade your rig; Good difficulty; Complex jobs; MAJOR PRO: There is freedom in this game, you can hack any company in the phonebook, you can hack into a bank and make yourself rich, you can give yourself a masters degree in Astrophysics, you can shut down hackers, ruin random peoples lives, make them rich, etc.\n\nCons: Can get boring, because although there are a few different types of jobs, they get repetitive since jobs in the same category are pretty much identical.\n\nNeutral/Subjective: Pretty hardcore game, your save is lost for good if you mess up (you can back it up by going to the save folder, but if you don't, you're back to the beginning of the game); Requires patience.\n\nConclusion: If you're patient, cool with text based games, and like hacking (not Watch_Dogs "hacking", proper hacking - although of course this game doesn't teach you how to hack, there are firewalls, proxies, etc., you're doing more than just mashing one button to "hack"), then this game was made for you, buy it. If the theme doesn't appeal to you much, maybe get it on sale, it might surprise you.\n\nFor some reason I am not capable of giving games an X/10 review, so yeah... Either way, it's good, definitely recommend it unless you are incapable of playing anything but action games.","June 23, 2014","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game at it's heart is about resource management with what you are doing & feels very much like a roguelike. You do jobs witch get you money witch let you upgrade your equipment so you can do more jobs. Eventualy you mess up bad and get your resources confiscated...basicly you lose/die.

And of course you can just say screw it all, digitally rob a bank, and go shutting down the computers of whoever you want and selling the identities of all your fellow hackers for money.","March 31, 2012","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And as you delve deeper and deeper, you will start to see the world you live in differently.\nYou'll start to realise how much we've become dependent.

It is a hacking game mainly focused around the use of programs (executed through the UI rather than the terminal) to hack into banks, research databases and more. The campaign is interesting but most of the fun occurs when you are hacking into secure databases with a countdown timer on how long before you are traced pulsing faster and faster until you either suceed or bug out. Or fail and go to jail (that is rather depressing). As you earn money, you can upgrade your programs and computer hardware to become more effective at hacking. Finally, as you hack important databases (like the Global Criminal Database), a news feed reflects this by creating an article describing "a malicious cyber attack has left the GCD crippled" (or some such).

Don't expect it to be realist, it looks like Hollywood hacking rather than real hacking. Or at least I guess, I never hacked anyone. And taking over someone's Facebook account because the password was 12345 is NOT hacking.\nBut I digress. That pretty is pretty good, even through sometimes, despite how much you covered your tracks, the AI will still manage to track you down, because it's the plot, and thou cannot avoid it.\n\nBut let's list all the good points :\n-lot of freedom\n-multiple endings\n-it's possible to send people in prison for no reason\n-it's possible to have someone arrested for "arson, murder, and he fapped to lolis"\n-you WILL become paranoid\n-gives a basic idea of how the Internet's like.\n-TUT... TUT... TUT... TUT TUT TUTUTUTUTUTUTUT.\n\nThe cons:\n-some missions are not simple, and sometimes, even through you think the mission is completed, you'll be forced to retry again because you forgot one thing.\n-the framing missions are complicated.\n-once you know how to do, the whole game can be a walk in the park. Especially the bank robbing thing.\n-the AI is pretty dumb. People never get suspicious when a guy named Ed Robinson suddenly becomes wanted for downloading CP, breaking paroles and repeating "ANONYMOUS WILL LIVE", even through they know that the global criminal database was compromised. And when the society he was working for is suddenly attacked and infected with viruses, they don't think of releasing him.\n-it may be difficult to read the small fonts.\n\n\nBut the game itself is fun. You really feel like you can take on anyone on Earth. There are mods, too.\nI'm sorry, Ed Robinson. You were just too efficient and too hard-working.","January 1, 2014","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as a computer hacker, and it's your job to hack just about everything. There's a good variety of side-missions alongside a relatively short campaign. The side-missions involve things like disabling systems, changing criminal records, and getting bank account details.\n\nThere's one type of side mission where a person will receive a large amount of money. The mission briefing tells you to get this person's name. However, if you have the proper tools, you can hack that person's account and take the money (usually above 500k credits) for yourself. The game gets a lot easier after doing so, since you can buy just about everything after doing it once or twice...\n\n...But on the flip side, it's super cool that you can hack a bank to get more money. That's the great thing about this game. You get to pick your own course of action without any hand-holding.\n\nAnd there's a functioning IRC client built into the game. 11/10 GOTYAY","December 27, 2013","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Uplink places you in the position of an 'agent' who works anonymously through the Uplink corporation. Uplink's purpose is to provide corporations with acces to anymous hackers, who can be hired, for a fee, to perform digital tasks such as espionage, stealing data, shutting down mainframes, and various other tasks. You will encounter a world full of firewalls, proxies, passwords, voice prints, elliptic curve ciphers, and even penetrate through LANs to find your target system. Earn money, buy impressive upgrades, like faster processors, more storage, and even bigger and better gateways that can support multiple processors, massive amounts of memory, and blazingly fast connection speeds. The hacking is very stylized and 'faked out', so don't go thinking it'll teach you how to hack into your sister's pc so you can find her prom pictures for posting on the internet. Nevertheless, this game rocks.\n\nWhile this title is quite old now, with dated graphics, and dated concepts, it is still a marvelous game, well executed, and far ahead of it's time.

Once you figure out how to do most of the missions, the fun factor wears down pretty quickly, but figuring out everything on your own is not as easy as you might think. It's highly addicting for the first several hours.","February 11, 2011","true","38.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From your home computer, secured behind the proprietary Uplink Gateway system at the nearest Uplink Corp. office, you can execute massive computer crimes and even take part in a story involving the entire Internet being placed at risk.\n\nUplink is an incredibly open game, so there are many ways you can proceed (including ignoring the story missions altogether)... but remember that "Trust is a Weakness". This game will instill you with paranoia very quickly, as you begin to second-guess yourself if you covered your tracks well enough to avoid that black GAME OVER screen meaning you've been tracked.","February 19, 2014","true","30.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

He showed his teeth to us when we wanted him to leave the computer. Finally we pulled the plug to his computer and removed the screens from his windows.

I wish, with all my heart, they'd have made an Uplink 2. I first got a free copy of this game to try it out. When I did, I also found out that the devs had finished with it and that no more would be done. After playing the game I was seriously interested in buying it to let the dev's know I really appreciated and loved the game. But it no longer mattered. I had come to the game way too late. As I said, they had quit developement. When I seen it on Steam I just HAD to have another go at it. So I bought it yet again.\n\nI know the tricks and such to having a blast with the game. Usually I don't even come close to getting caught. lol I just finshed yet another play and I got caught this time. I had found 4 seperate bank accounts with over 500k in each. For a total take of 3.9 mill. lol I got greedy and sloppy. I bought me a system with 1 security slot and installed a nuke. So I needn't have gotten caught. But i thought I'd have time to transfer all 4 accounts to my 3rd bank account with no worries. I was in the middle of the second transfer when I my screen went black.... For a moment I thought I had finally found a bug. Then the notice about getting caught came up. I was sooo ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Now I'm smiling an laughing at it all.\n\nThe game is nothing like real life hacking, I'm sure.

This game successfully captures the '80s style of hacking into a video game form.\n\nWhat makes this game so brilliant is the 'tracing' that is performed whenever you attempt to hack a server. Using any form of brute-force technique or logging in as an admin starts an 'active trace'. This means that you have a limited amount of time before the server admin's find your ip and hit you with fines or jail time, so you must be quick enough to get in and out of the server before your time runs out. There is also what is known as 'passive tracing'. This starts after you have hacked a server, done what you needed to do, and have gotten out. The server admins will begin checking log files to check the ip through which you have connected, essentially meaning that the admins will be creeping up on you through these logs, so you mest never forget to delete them! One simple mistake in this game can cause you to be caught and you fill face jail time. The game is hardcore, in which if you get caught, your save will be deleted forcing you to restart the entire thing again from the beginning.\n\nOne of the things to be aware of is that this game can get repetetive. If you are caught and must restart from the beginning again, you will essentially be doing the same jobs again. If you can get past this, there is a lot to be enjoyed.\n\nSome of the starting jobs will be simple things such as copying files from servers and sending them in an email to your contract employer or deleting certain files from a server. If you manage not to get caught in the beginning and make it to the later-game levels, there will be some interesting jobs such as framing people and wiping entire databases. Don't think that money will come to you easily either in this game, you will have to grind to get some of the better equipment (or you can hack a bank, try not to get caught doing that ;) ). And always never forget the simple things of hacking in this game. For example, forgetting to delete your logs just once will make you lose, so never forget to delete your logs!\n\nThe main story is about a company attempting to develop a virus and destory the internet. There are two sides that you may choose, to side with them and help develop the virus, or to side with another company and try to stop them. The choice is completely yours. Much of the story and campain is delivered through the news board in the Internal Services System and through emails that you receive, so make sure to read these.\n\nGraphic wise, there isn't much to say. The game follows the same 'the graphics aren't good because it's old' rule. Most of it is text-based/gui-based, and it is black and blue, so try not to let it strain your eyes. If anything, there are community themes which can be found online with a quick google search to shake things up a bit.\nThe soundtrack, is nice and fits with the theme of this game perfectly. Again, not much to say.\n\nOverall, this game is nice, and if you can get past it being very repetetive, it can prove to be very interesting and much fun.","August 8, 2015","true","49.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However there are loads of details that are not vital for gameplay, but they are annoying.\nFor example,  ip addresses: these are just random numbers, but from broken range (I usually got adresses like 842.274.407.350)\nNames of programs and warning/error messages are not corresponding to reality. (I got message like access denied by proxy.  I tried to change my proxy map so it will not use the broken one. Nope. You have to buy program proxy_disable which disables proxy.

I have never, EVER, played a game so repetetive. And enjoyed it so much. Theres no real skill needed except timing, when you start firewall and proxy disables, how much time you have left, typing something right so you don't have to redo it and possibly run our of time. Every now and then when I say to myself "this is getting boring, pulling up the passcode breaker (which you dont need to do anything to hack a password), then clicking on the copy and paste key" the game always pulls you back in, giving you new missions with more variety. It even gives you a chance to work against your fellow hackers. There are a few gameplay details skipped (but mentioned) in the tutorial, including erasing your trails, but so far I haven't been erasing my trails and i'm still going strong. Not only is the gameplay pretty fun, but only a few breaks in dialogue tell you that it's a game. The whole time, it's as if you are an actual illegal hacker, and not just some time wasting yet entertaining game. 8/10 would buy for 20 cents again (prisoner architect sale).","June 15, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't expect it to be realist, it looks like Hollywood hacking rather than real hacking. Or at least I guess, I never hacked anyone. And taking over someone's Facebook account because the password was 12345 is NOT hacking.\nBut I digress. That pretty is pretty good, even through sometimes, despite how much you covered your tracks, the AI will still manage to track you down, because it's the plot, and thou cannot avoid it.\n\nBut let's list all the good points :\n-lot of freedom\n-multiple endings\n-it's possible to send people in prison for no reason\n-it's possible to have someone arrested for "arson, murder, and he fapped to lolis"\n-you WILL become paranoid\n-gives a basic idea of how the Internet's like.\n-TUT... TUT... TUT... TUT TUT TUTUTUTUTUTUTUT.\n\nThe cons:\n-some missions are not simple, and sometimes, even through you think the mission is completed, you'll be forced to retry again because you forgot one thing.\n-the framing missions are complicated.\n-once you know how to do, the whole game can be a walk in the park. Especially the bank robbing thing.\n-the AI is pretty dumb. People never get suspicious when a guy named Ed Robinson suddenly becomes wanted for downloading CP, breaking paroles and repeating "ANONYMOUS WILL LIVE", even through they know that the global criminal database was compromised. And when the society he was working for is suddenly attacked and infected with viruses, they don't think of releasing him.\n-it may be difficult to read the small fonts.\n\n\nBut the game itself is fun. You really feel like you can take on anyone on Earth. There are mods, too.\nI'm sorry, Ed Robinson. You were just too efficient and too hard-working.","January 1, 2014","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Doing the same work, with different companies, and very little risk. But as you work your way up, and the stakes get raised, and one tiny mistake is the difference between payday and being caught by the FBI is truly when the game shines.\n\nYou might think "oh, well I'm not really that good at these games", but the game offers a decent enough tutorial to get started. It starts really low so that you can get used to it - which is both a fault and a good thing - and works it's way up slowly in both what you have access to, and how difficult the missions become.\n\nYou might not even know what half the HUD you're presented does at the moment, but don't worry - almost everything in this game has a purpose.\n\nWorking UpSlowly, you'll go from doing work copying files from obsecure companies to higher-scale operations, like hacking into the Social Security database and marking someone as deceased. You'll start getting better gear, but with that you're asked to work quicker, work better, and make less mistakes. Slowly it becomes less of "damn, this file is too big" to "♥♥♥♥ THE FBI ARE COMING FOR ME". And it does this perfectly, in essence.\n\nThough the game engine occasionally makes a cheap mistake, it's rare and whenever I was caught I could identify what I did wrong. It was always some trail of breadcrumbs leading back to me, and if you're caught at first - it's ok. There's a lot of learning to do.\n\nAt the TopDepending on how well you understand the game, you'll eventually be making a decent living for yourself, to the point at which you don't even necessarily need to worry about doing contracts to make the Uplink funding requirements. You can explore the deeper and darker secrets at the heart of this game, which I expected there to not be many of.\n\nThere's always a hidden admin panel on Uplink's website. Do you try opening it? What will happen? There's also a big company which - according to the in-game news site - is working on a massive internet virus. Do you attempt to intervene and save the internet as a whole?\n\nLessons LearnedIn my time played, I've discovered the following tips will help a lot with this game:\nAlways make sure to delete logs\nBig corporations work with the FBI a lot\nEven one false connection, one ♥♥♥♥ up, is the difference between freedom, and prison\nFailure is failure (yes, that's right, in this game, if you fail, it's game over)\nIn all, I highly recommend this game for it's excellent ability to teach you stuff without forcing you to sit through a tutorial, and truly making you want to explore the environment and the world in the game, looking for shady stuff, for weird connections.\n\nMy score: 9.5/10","June 20, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You take contracts to destroy/recover documents, track people's bank accounts, change their status on government documents, steal from banks, etc.\n\nThe game is a bit of a grind early on, but picks up pace after doing a few missions. This and the fact that if you  just look up and add all of the servers in the beginning, the game becomes fairly easy as you can bounce your connection between them all (effectively giving you a huge boost of time),  are the only faults I personally find with this game. For $5, this would be a great deal. But in it's current state it just isn't worth the $9.99 price tag.\n\nAll in all, I give Uplink a 6.5/10 for it's current price, and 7.5/10 if it was a bit cheaper. There just isn't enough content for ten whole dollars.","June 20, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now, if you are really into stories in games, this is probably not the game for you. If it has a story, I didn't come across it. Although, the lack of plot is totally made up for in the vast amount of things for you to do. You can steal files, change your identity, change OTHERS identities, fake Social Security Numbers, create a virus, and SO much more. Plus it feels like your Neo from The Matrix or something when you just blast through firewalls and proxys, not letting the people running whatever you're breaking into know! Now it may look a little daunting from all the pictures, but trust me, the controls are easy and once you get the hang of it it's very easy to navigate through the computer screens.

I haven't hacked a bank yet, but I can't wait to do that. This is one of the only decent hacking games on Steam, and is the best one by far. I remember playing this at a friend's house a while back and going rogue on the Uplink agency. They almost caught me, but what they didn't know is that I had a motion sensor on my gateway computer that, when triggered, would cause the explosives on the gateway to explode, therefore keeping them from finding me.

In my opinion, its the way that no matter how much of a master you are, one ♥♥♥♥ up on your end, and its all over. The game isn't scripted so that you fail at some point if you fail an objective. As long as you wipe the logs, cover you ♥♥♥, and are doubly sure that you have wiped the logs, then your in no real danger. But yet, if you forget to wipe one log, on one server, once, its over. Your done, you were caught. Good job. You ♥♥♥♥ed up. You did. Not the game cheating you, you did. If you looked around hard enough, you will figure out what you did wrong, and move on.\n\nOnto of this amazing idea, the game feels right. The first time I booted it up, I was waiting for prison architect to finish downloading, I entered a login and password. Then I got dialed into my "gateway" I was so scared that I was going to be arrested for hacking. I thought that steam HAD to ban this, it was a hacking tool. Turns out, nope, its just a game. Something I learned a good few months later.\n\nNext is the "gateway", which is the name of the server that you run your hacks from It is a perfect name for it. Because its a gateway drug into the world of uplink.It is your lifeblood in uplink. You don't play as "someone" you play as you. If you leave your computer while the game is running, to go make yourself a cup of tea or coffee. Your hacker just did. Because the game makes you feel like you are the hacker behind the gateway.\n\nLastly, my final words, encase you cant tell, get this game. But more importantly, get this game and play it. It made me fall in love with the world of cyber security, the thrill it gave me when I hacked my first server is something that everyone needs to feel. So buy this damn game.","December 11, 2014","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Anyone who is into that sort of thing should play this. Now, I will mostly be comparing this game to Hacknet here, since I have it on GOG, but not Steam.\n\nUplink is MUCH better than Hacknet, which is not a very good game even without the bugs. It's not 'realistic' in any way, it just makes you do Hollywood hacking through a terminal instead of an easy-to-use interface.\n\nUplink, on the other hand, is very simple, and relatively linear, in the sense that there is no point in hacking outside of a mission, but at least it's fun and has high stakes, what with irreversible game overs.\n\nHacknet has an even more simplistic interface than Uplink, which is saying a lot. You do the same thing over and over again in both, but at least in Uplink, that same thing is relatively complicated!\n\nNow for the shortcomings of Uplink. There are, with some exceptions, only three types of systems to hack, one of which is the LAN, a complex and interesting gameplay element. There are also only two security systems, the firewall and the proxy.\n\nIn short, if you liked this game (you know you did!) I would recommend playing Onlink, a heavy mod of Uplink, which adds tons of new features, security systems, and computer types. You can even hack other agents' gateways! (Although they are NPC agents.) In addition, the developers are now making Kite, a game which, if they actually manage to pull it off, I believe will be the greatest hacking game of all time. So help them out!\n\nApologies to Hacknet fans, as well as to Steam for the unconventional review. Again, I would have put this on Hacknet's page, but I only own it outside of Steam.","May 22","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The only game of it's type (well, besides the games Slavehack and Hacker Evolution, but those are inferior) Very simple gameplay, eerie soundtrack, not for everyone, but a great timewaster or hobby for people interested in this. The game is entirely fictional, the tools and stuff you use are really neat and add speed and puzzles to the gameplay.\n\nIf you get caught hacking though, you have to start over from scratch.

If you like intense, action-paced fighting games, or otherwise games were you don't have to sit at a simplistic screen the entire time, or do much work at all, then this is NOT for you. If you do, however, like games that make you think quickly and thoroughly, this is definately for you.\n\nThis game has a lot going for it, be it the fast-paced soundtrack to keep the intensity going, the challenging gameplay, or the fact that a single mistake can lead you to a game over. Uplink is unforgiving, because you need to cover all your tracks before the time is up and you're caught, or you'll have to start all over again.\n\nThink you're safe behind save files? Not in uplink. When you're caught, you're caught. Profile destroyed. Everything lost. Learn to play before you play, it will save you hours of pain wondering why you just got disavowed.\n\nOther than the unforgiving style, the gameplay is fun and makes you remember a strict process of what do to before you're done. When the reward is is higher, so is the danger of the job. And that is why I reccomend Uplink.\n\nUnforgiving, strict, and fun all in one package. Although, be warned if you don't like computers atleast a little or repetetive gameplay, because Uplink has demand for both of those.","July 13, 2015","true","13.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
