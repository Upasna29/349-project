It isn't very good either as the shooting mechanics are unpolished and there are no players.

The game is a multi-player based game where in order to kill the opposing players you must destroy the brain! *Mmmm Brains* This game features full body destruction and we mean full body!  Hell!!! Even the skin on your back isn't safe in the world of CubeZ. They've got full character customization, armor classes that determine how fast your character can move and just how much damage you can sustain before the armor is destroyed, leaving you vulnerable to have the skin ripped right off your bones.\n\nPros:\nActive Developers that live streams his work to update and develop this game http://www.twitch.tv/imaekgames\nDevelopers that posted a warning in the about this game section rather than listing more information about the game knowing it is a high alpha release at this time.\nFull Body Decay. You can literally fight until someone finally blows your brains out!\nInteractive armor classes: Light armor makes your character faster while heavy slows you down. All armor classes have different durability that reflects as you'd expect them to.\nNew content that will release as the developers finish it over the next 6 months.\nDevelopers that are actually working on this game with all their time and not just doing it in their spare time.\nCons:\nUnfinished game/ not close to being finished.\nAlpha bugs & crashes.\nSome MP lag that comes with alpha releases.\nYou just have to decide for yourself on weather or not you will like the game. There are game play reviews and I agree with them. the game is a lot of fun and the developers are active and play/ interact with the community. While I don't think this game is worth the $15 yet, I believe in the developers to finish this project unlike many other early access games and will recommend the game to any who think it interesting/ wanna see what the full product can do.","January 6, 2015","true","0.2"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

I have been following the game's development since it was first on greenlight, and I am very pleased with the direction that it has took. The map designs are also great, each one has its own unique thing about it that makes it a game worth playing. The new Capture the Flag mode adds lots of new ways to play the game, including strategy based play, where you cooperate with teammates to distract the enemy team so that someone can sneak by and take the flag.

A game in early access doesn't has to be good but has to trigger you with awesome possibilities to be eager to play again and again. When I play this I wanna cry. Luckely this game was in a bundlesale for 2$ , cause its not worth the 14 euro, even if its still in alpha mode.\n\nI think the game misses alot of things like:\n1. Atmosphere. It feels empty and static and the maps are simplistic. Maybe add some variety in the maps in the form of different landscape / vegetation.\n2. Concept. I think small develop teams who are "rookies" shouldn't make a game like this where there are dozens of big companies who make them better because of their resources. You should let your creativity go crazy and I don't see that in this game, no , not even in the fact that you can destroy a character totally.\n3. Aimsystem feels weird and the bullets look like you are shooting glitches.\n\nFor the rest ill be nice because I don't wanna bash the 2 developers who are in a learning process.
