"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Trilion/recommended/221020/","Trilion","Trilion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Trilion/","358 products in account","TL;DR: DO NOT PURCHASE\nThe game is broken and unfinished.\nThe game is abandoned by the developers.\nThey're censoring constructive negative criticism.\nThey essentially took the $2 million dollars and ran.\nThey're not letting new potential buyers know it's abandoned.\nThe GameI played the game for around 300 hours in total. Only around 80 of those were recorded by Steam due to me playing the other hours within Steam Offline mode. In darkness and secrecy, the game was abandoned by the developers during Alpha, the updates stopped rolling out and eventually, many months later a non significant update was released and the game was now considered "Finished" according to the their Steam Store page. But in truth, the game was nowhere near being finished, it had and still has a ton of bugs and issues. There's a lot of things missing from the game, and the AI is beyond horrible. The AI is bad enough to give your townsfolk a tendency to end up killing themselves. I wish I could say that events such as that are rare, but they aren't. It's common and in some occasions, it causes your entire village to die.\n\nMarketingThere were no/still isn't any announcements or information on the Town's store page letting potential new buyers know that the project has been abandoned.  Eventually articles surfaced saying that the game was indeed abandoned, the developers were interviewed and claimed  "In fact, the team is currently thinking about instead working on a sequel to Towns through which they want to implement all the features that they could not with the original game."  and within their community forums, one of the developers claim that Originally posted by Burningpet on www.townsgame.com: Towns is very much alive and kicking.	 Originally posted by Burningpet on www.townsgame.com: So so far Towns has sold more than 200k units and generated a gross revenue of more than 2M usd. and although we are pretty sure we can and will sell a lot more, we still see it as a huge success.\nDictatorship / CensorshipAfter reading some reviews of the game, and reading the original posts people made on the Steam and/or townsgame.com forum. (Including deleted ones, thanks to caching) It's quite clear that the developers are silencing anyone and everyone who is posting/discussing negative critizism of their game. And they're doing it forcefully, they're also going the extra mile by deleting the post, banning the user and then responding to it publicly, claiming the player posted harassment among other accusations. Due to them removing the post/thread and banning the user, there's no way for a reader to verify what happened unless the reader has cached versions of the forum. Out of the 50 posts I read through, which all had been deleted for "Boycotting" "Harassment" and other reasons. Only a mere 6 of them had anything that was even borderline harassment or boycotting.\n\nConclusionEssentially, me and many others came to the conclusion that they took the money and ran. They're still trying to get people to buy it by censoring everything they can. And the reason for abandoning the game? Because they were "burnt out" yet they claim they will make a sequel. Do not purchase this game, and I highly advice people not to purchase any future releases or new games from this company/developers ever again based solely on what they're doing with this game and the social media involving it.\n\nRefundValve added a refund addition to Steam on June 2nd, 2015 that could potentially allow customers to refund Towns as the development of the game has halted.\nOriginally posted by Valve on http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/?l=english:You can request a refund for nearly any purchase on Steam—for any reason. Maybe your PC doesn't meet the hardware requirements; maybe you bought a game by mistake; maybe you played the title for an hour and just didn't like it.\n\nIt doesn't matter. Valve will, upon request via help.steampowered.com, issue a refund for any reason, if the request is made within fourteen days of purchase, and the title has been played for less than two hours. There are more details below, but even if you fall outside of the refund rules we’ve described, you can ask for a refund anyway and we’ll take a look.\nFeedbackDon't hesitate responding with any constructive criticism that I could use to improve my reviews. Also note that posting your own experiences with Towns whether good or bad assists potential newcomers in making their decision in whether to purchase the game or not.","June 11, 2015","false","77.6"," 1,187 of 1,203 people (99%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","99","187","1","23","14"

The developer posted a ton of ideas, some good-looking screenshots, and pitched a solid concept.\n\nBefore I even get to the review, I'd like to note that THE DEVELOPER HAS ABANDONED THE GAME.  He took the "Early Access" money, cranked out an Alpha-at-best version of the game and left.  He got another developer to theoretically try to finish the game, but the hopes of that actually happening are looking pretty dim.\n\nSo as for the game itself.  You build a town to attract heroes to explore and clear dungeons.  Sounds good.  The execution is NOT.  It's a buggy mess, with villagers having AI and path-finding so bad that they often get stuck and starve.   You control which heroes arrive, can't tell them what to do, and can't even sell them items.  The crafting system is tedious and the building system feels like it's constantly fighting against you.\n\nIt's a buggy, barely-playable mess with no endgame, few sounds, and almost no animations.  Avoid like the plague.\n\nEDIT: The developers responsible for taking your money and running are Xavi Canal and Ben Palgi.  I've been asked a few times to mention them here so if you see any projects from them in the future, you can remember this cash-grab and avoid them.","October 25, 2014","false","33.4"," 1,275 of 1,317 people (97%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","97","275","1","28","18"

During the most recent sale I pointed users to a great review about the history of the game and what has happened with the devs.. It was removed as "boycott thread" I then made a post regarding how it wasn’t and it was a review... I was then banned from the forums.\n\nI have never seen such shadyness from developers or steam forum moderators.  Stay FAR AWAY!!!\n\nHere is why I was supposedly banned...\nYou have been banned from Towns Discussions by a forum moderator for your post in "Towns General Discussions":\nYetiChow Moderator 3 hours ago\nDeleted thread "Don't buy this game". Reason: spam, calls to boycott, and the fact that the same topic has been done to death already. Also a rather icky necroposting.\n\nA reminder, these kind of boycott threads will NOT be tolerated. There's a reviews page for reviews; if people ask for opinions then that's another place to give them; but these unsolicited boycott threads are just unacceptable.\nI highly disagree with this. My original post was notifying potential buyers of a great review that was written about this game. It told the back story of what happened with the devs for this game and how they abandoned it(surprise? it just happened again). How could that be a "boycott thread"? If I had somehow managed to find a positive review for towns and asked the user base to read it and get educated of the background of the game it would somehow be tolerated. This just again shows how shady you are YetiCHow for removing threads entirely and labelling them as something they are not.\n\nUpdate:  YetiChow has now updated his original post to again try to make me look bad.  If you are going to police the forums in a dictatorship manner and not allow users to share reviews or their opinions unless it is in a positive way atleast own up to it.\n\nYetiChow Moderator\nI was going to avoid naming names in the hope this was an isolated incident; but apparently that's not the case. Also deleted another topic by the same user bizkit_109, written in response to my deleting the original thread. This user has now been warned, and further behaviour in the same manner will not be tolerated.\nApparently they like to silence any honest negativety towards the game and if you display any of that you get the big ban hammer.  What a joke this develpoer is and the staff it lets moderate its steam forums.\n\nUPDATE!!! MAY 28 2015 !!!!!\nAfter a user made a post asking YetiChow to comment about my review he again went after me and spread more lies saying the following:\nYetiChow Moderator\nFor the record, I'm the one who issued that ban, not Supermalparit, not Burningpet, nor Moebius (the "second dev" who seems to be the person this post is addressed to?). The reason I issued that ban was because the poster was spamming (and worse, abusing other posters as well as the developers; the spam offence happened to be the straw which finally broke the camel's back).I didn't want him again to be able to lie to the community and spread more misinformation so I confronted him on this as I never attacked the devs nor another forum poster.  He then banned me permanently from the forums.  Here is the screen shot of his post, my reply, and my new ban.  What a joke this guy is.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Auuyizz.jpg\n\nSTAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS GAME AND ANYTHING ELSE SMP DEVELOPS!!

First off, the demo does not give you the greatest feel for the game, just proves that the basic mechanics are working....\n\nI'd also like to point this out, HEAVY MODERATION in the forums, see link below. If YETI does not agree with you or finds a reason to delete "negative" posts, he will. If you post in the forums, YETI will justify and "help" you make sense of the horrible AI and how the game was built as SH***Y as it is but it was all done like this on purpose. He responds to every comment to mask the amount of players who feel the same way about the game. Discussions that become overwhelming negative he will delete because the discussion is going in "circles" Check his own delete blog on the link below. This type of moderation in the forums is one attempt to keep the game alive. He HEAVILY defends the game at every chance even with all of the people arguing with him. The only people who agree are Lvl 0 Steam Users with Blocked Profiles.... Enough said.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/221020/discussions/0/35220315866244607/\n\nNow for the review:\n\nThe game is time consuming which is why you may see players with a fair amount of hours, the bugs become more apparent the longer you play. Horrible AI, AI starving itself with plenty of food. Slow productivity of the AI. You have to micromanage every aspect of the game which to me and everyone else in the forums, is horrible AI construction and pathing that they will not fix. If you attempt to build a house all at once in the game, the builders constructing it will not stop working on it until it is finished, that includes dieing in the process from starvation (with plenty of food next to them).... feel free to drop me a comment on here with anything else you would like to know. *I do not respond to Lvl 0 Steam accounts with blocked profiles, your comment will get deleted.\n\nDungeons get even more involved and getting to them is a pain... to say the least. Construction is not polished at all.\n\nTo sum it up, the game runs, if you work around the poor mechanics of the game, it is playable. Its extremely time consuming which looking at this game, it should be a faster payout of fun since its a bit behind its time.\n\nThere is no Dev support in the forums, just moderators pushing the game every now and then.

Let me clarify .. some other reviewers mention Early Access but the fact of the matter is that this game was not released as Early Access, it was being offered as a finished product when I bought it back in 2012.. well no way was it finished then and still isn't now 2 years later! It could be said that Early Access hadn't started back then so we might forgive that transgression - but then this game should either be categorized as Early Access right now or removed from Steam because it isn't the complete product it is being marketed as.\n\n\n*if you want a charming game where little computer people wander round and build a home, eat, sleep, dig up treasure, fight monsters, etc.. then go check out 'Craft the World', this is an Early Access title that already feels like it's polished and finished(except for missing later campaign levels); it certainly feels like a AAA title compared to Towns..","October 28, 2014","false","176.9"," 340 of 362 people (94%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","94","340","362","14","0"

It has been completly abandoned by the developers.\n\nI recomend instead;\nSTONEHEARTH; A very similar game that is constantly updated, already has numerous features, great 3D graphics and most importantly a great AI. Has made incredible acess since it first realeased.\n\nGNOMORIA; A game that is also very similar to towns, with a similar graphics style and a fourth of the price or less when on sale. ALso has much better AI than towns\n\nCOLCKWORK EMPIRES; A game with simialr gameplay to towns but with a steampunk vibe. It is regularly updated and the game has made great progress since its early acess release.\n\nIn other words all these games will give you very similar gameplay with better AI, and more importantly, a developement team which is on top of updating and talking about their game.

Yes that is currently a problem for this game.  If like me you picked up this game back when it was first greenlit only to assume that it would actually get patched and improved over time I feel your pain.  If you're looking at reviews to decide whether it's worth your money you can get a lot more enjoyment out of other games at any price point and a lot less frustration.  You can mod the heck out of the game manually to make it somewhat passible to get past some of the more glaring development omissions but it only gets you so far.

A few very minor bugs are present, the AI is a bit dopey, the enemy scaling is absurd (due to the market system, you can get Gold, a top tier material early on and proceed to completely stomp the first 5 or 6 floors of the dungeon, then suddenly it all comes to a halt on the next floor as enemies can one or two shot your heroes regardless of armor because armor only increases evasion, it doesn't make people more capable of taking damage) the game can have massive lag at times when doing mass item hauling (most common when you want to sell several buckets of iron) and the punishment for doing something wrong can be horrible especially when you don't know why said thing is bad (ie you have to make graves for corpses or they spawn strong ghosts, but now there's an event lategame that can rarely spawn even stronger Zombies for your village to fight off if you didn't build your graveyard a mile away, even high level zombies can spawn potentially adding to the death toll unless your village is well equipped O_O\n\nHowever, despite all the bad things, I feel like they're more nitpicks that could be ironed out later (if they ever do) the game is strangely satisfying when you do the smallest of things. I felt glad when I got my first town up and running with a constant food supply and with enough production to allow the town to build walls and decor to make them happier, which brings more people in, and eventually Heroes, whom I also got a nice warm feeling from when they moved in, especially a cameo from the fantastic Sips_ :D. When a dungeon level gets cleared there's also that good feeling when you clean all the loot out and equip the village with better items to withstand the ever increasing sieges that want to ruin all your fun. Overall there's just a great feeling I get from getting things done right, it's oddly satisfying to watch all your little people mine out all the stone before converting it into a storage room for your builders so you can continue to build up the town walls to make it harder for the sieges from completely stomping all over all your work so far, and i got a really good chuckle when the nasty hoard of yeti coming in to storm the place is almost completely wiped out before they reach their victims because you built a bridge that serves as the only way in that's completely lined with traps, and watching them set them all off (sadly there's no real animation, but it's still great to watch a big bad yeti get his foot caught in a bear trap and his friend who walked on ahead set off the bamboo shooter, hitting them both as well as anyone else nearby, then the log traps finish off the already wounded, before the villagers team up to pick off any surviving monsters that are likely bleeding from every possible area of their body. Perhaps next time they'll realize that the decaying goblin heads shoved on the pikes outside are a sign that this town is defended)\n\nIf you already own a copy go ahead and have a blast directing all your little people to their fates. Grab some mods to fix some of the problems and some of the frustrating elements and you're good to go. If it appears in a bundle with some other things you're interested in, go ahead and give it a go, you might like it. But I would not buy this game through steam now, especially at full price, when there are more options available that either offer more polished development, are cheaper or promise so much more in the future. Gnomoria, Craft the World and Banished are all around the same price but all offer their own quirks and are still being developed regularly or are even finished in the case of Banished.\n\nThe main reason I am not recommending this is because the devteam, they released a game which was basically in alpha, but not stating as such, they slowly developed said game over about a year, then dropped it. Now I can perfectly understand their situation, as one who actually browsed the forums, they got too deep into something they shouldn't have, their reputation was on the line, their own personal lives were causing them trouble. They hired another developer but their paycheck would have been so low that they too eventually dropped the project. When the game was left in this dropped state, the steam community went wild, with people buying the game just to give it a negative review, the product tags mostly consisting of "scam" and "abandoned" and the reviews said nothing about the game. The development of the game has since continued, however i would still not buy this game until they can promise to the buyers that they can bring out frequent updates (updates as of late have been very minor and slow, but a v15 is in development to help fix some issues)\n\nSo until then, if you have it already, have fun, otherwise it's probably best to stay away unless it's on sale for £3 and you're curious or have nothing better to do for a rainy weekend. Then again, if the devs do get off their butts and finish the game, this could possibly be one of the best entry level Dwarf Fortress clones ever...","November 18, 2014","false","104.8"," 181 of 191 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","181","191","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/egamer76/recommended/221020/","egamer76","Good Ol' Bender","http://steamcommunity.com/id/egamer76/","74 products in account","The first and most infamous game to come out of Steam's "Greenlight" program, Towns is an incomplete and buggy mess, released in a beta state (yet conusmers such as myself were not initially informed of the fact it was still in beta) that never was completed, but rather ABANDONED by its programmer in a miserable state.  That's right, the sole developer/programmer took the money and ran.  The game is as complete as it will ever be, and that's very depressing.\n\nTowns was billed as a "Dwarf Fortress"-type game, wherein you build a town atop a "dungeon" filled with various baddies.  Your goal is to build a nice enough town to support guards to protect your citizens, and adventurers who will come to your city (given your city has the necessary buildings) and venture into the depths to assault the creatures therein.  The problem is the programming is dreadfully incompetent.  The AI is beyond dumb.  People will stand around and starve to death rather than harvest and eat food.  Citizens will wander off alone and get themselves killed by groups of enemies.  The "tutorial," if you can call it that, teaches you next to nothing about the game.  The still images of the towns initially shown on the game's Steam page were actually impossible to create in the game.  Building (especially roofs) is an exercise in frustration as pieces don't seem to want to fit together like they should.  The programmer's ambitions far exceeded his capabilities and after as few beta updates (which didn't really fix anything), he simply bailed.  What a great guy.\n\nDon't buy Towns.  Get something better.  And practically ANYTHING is better than this pile of excrement.","September 27, 2014","false","24.3"," 197 of 212 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","197","212","3","0"

I have bought numerous early access games ( Prison Architect, Starbound, Space Base DF9 (ugh), Kerbal SPace Program etc.) Some have been solid games that keep building on themselves and are enjoyable even in early alpha (like KSP), some have been rocky but still enjoyable and are continuing to be made and starting to look better (Starbound), and then there are the games that don't really evolve much and kind of just.... stop.\n\nI bought this game around the release date thinking that it was a neat fresh look at dungeon crawling with city building and some basic logistics managment. I was totally jazzed at the idea and played the game into the ground for a couple of weeks. I had a bit of trouble with the building system, but I figured that had more to do with me being a n00b at the game. (It was a mess since your villagers could get stuck on air and kinda just... sat there as they got eaten by the critters and such on the surface.),. To be fair though there wasn't a tutorial at all at the time.\n\nI also found it impossible to attract addidtional villagers to the town or any heroes, even after fitting all of the criterea that the wiki said was required. The lack of forward movement gameplaywise is what lead me to drop the game until it hit beta.\n\nNow many moons later I come back to check out what is up with a game that I wanted so much to love and find out that it has been pretty much dropped by the devs. I liken it to ordering a car from somewhere and stopping by for a test drive of a prototype. You drive it and think it's all cool and can't wait for the consumer model, but after hearing nothing for a while you drop by again to see how the car is coming and the one they let you drive is exactly the same except they added seatbelts. Granted that I didn't drop $20,000 on this game and that this game is not a car, you get pretty much the same feeling, like someone took your money and gave you a shoddy product.\n\nIf only I knew then what I know now.\n\nTL;DR\n\nShoddy at best and the devs dropped the game.","October 28, 2014","false","21.5"," 183 of 195 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","183","195","4","8"

From the moment I heard about this game in the Royal Indie Bundle, I fell in love with it. I played tens of hours of it through Desura. I desparately wanted this game to succeed because it was like a beautiful growing flower that would blossom with so much potential. I was an active contributor on the game forums along with others who shared the same passion. Then Steam Greenlight was launched and when this game was one of the first to be on passed through it, I was absolutely thrilled. And then, it all went south. The game was becoming more and more complex (which isnt necessarily a bad thing) but the way the developer did it made it more robust and annoying to get into. On top of that, each update introduced more and more bugs. The developers became less and less responsive. One of them left due to family concerns which is understandable. The gap between updates became longer and longer. Soon enough, the developers just disappeared. The game stayed in its buggy alpha state for months. Then out of nowhere a new dev was hired to fix it up. Except after only one update, he too seemingly has disappeared and the game continues in its buggy alpha state. I wanted to love this game. I wanted to see this game completed and succeed, I really wanted to. I now see that that future will never arrive.\n\nDon't get this game. It's dead and abandoned.

This game came 2012 to steam greenlight and was a interesting project, where you create a world in which yo have to make andventurers happy and not to be the adventurer.\n\nBut what did go wrong?\nIt's pretty easy. The developer cashed the money in, which was brought by many people, who were exicted (like me), to try it, to play it and to support it. But unfortunately the developement stopped in 2014.\n\nWhat's wrong with that?\nSo the problem with this is, that this game is far from being finished. This game is still in alpha and lacks many features, so many that you could rather say it is not much fun to play this game. I got very disapointed as i have heard that and my money is lost, just because someone did not manage to get their things right and just because he did not have ambitions anymore to work on this project, he stopped!\n\nI want to say one thing. I burned myself on this game and on some other. I would recommend for everyone not to buy early acess games or greenlights, just as they appear, but to wait and watch or to look at reviews. We gamers have to put a stop to such methods, we can not allow this to happen to us anymore!\n\nI do not recommend this game, don't buy it and don't support someone who disappointed thousands of players, with an unfinished, not even polished, game. He earnend about 2 MILLIONS $ with it and left the game just as it is, UNFINISHED!\n\nI would rather recommend you "DwarfFortress", it's free, developed by only 2 guys and can offer you much more.

I got the game when it first came out (before you could purchase beta access to games). The game was difficult to figure out and very clearly incomplete. At the time it hadn't claimed to be anything other than complete so I was surprised by the alpha phase feel of the game. The tutorial wasn't clear or useful and I had to take to the internet to learn how to play.\n\nThe UI is awful and looks largely like it is meant as a placeholder until the game is further along and finished. The game is still not finished. The last update released for the game as of this writing (12/6/2013) was 9/30. That update made some things better, but didn't really affect the problems, such as the weirdness with townies auto-equipping things, the awful UI, the terrible tutorial, the stupid pathing and ai, the cruddy combat system etc.\n\nI was really looking forward to this game because it is similar in spirit to games like Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Keeper, but it fails miserably and doesn't seem to be trying all that much. If you are a fan of DF or DK, I suggest just playing either of them, or try Gnomoria. Gnomoria is regularly updated and communicative with the player base. Don't get this game unless you are the kind of person who gets a kick out of bad games.\n\nUpdate 8/19/2015:\nJust wanted to add that as far as anyone can tell, the developers have abandoned this project and Steam continues to leave it up where it can still be sold. If you made the easy mistake of purchasing this game thinking it is complete or being worked on, please keep in mind you can refund games now and refund as soon as possible.

Then gnomoria came out and had its fully 3d block system and the devs then decided they wanted to compleatly rewrite the game to have this feature. I guess many in the comunity wanted it but in my honest opinion this was a bad move. It made the game look too much not like its previous version and dident add anything to the gameplay other then you could build a better looking buildings. The game is a town building game not a building building game they went in the wrong direction however this was not what killed it. What killed it was one of the dev's having a personal crisis that then forced them to not concentrate on the game. This in turn spiraled into more work for the other dev's and them loosing intrest.

The original developers lost interest, which is a huge risk for people who are paid in advance for the promise of a product to come, and effectively decided to cut and run.  They farmed the work to a new developer who was working solely for a percentage of future sales, and the small improvements that were being made never generated those.\n\nThis game is not actively being developed and is not worth a third of the asking price in its current state, which is a damned shame, becuase this genre could use more finished games, and fewer abandoned skeletal concepts.","January 11, 2015","false","28.7"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","29","33","0","1"

I justified both purchases, because I was genuinely excited over the prospect of the game, and wanted to support it as much as I could. I was wrong.\n\nThe game and by extension the original community presented the concept to be a Dwarf Fortress like game with better graphics, but I would argue that it is more closely related to the old Majesty games without a mission scenario. Your objective is to build up a town that will attract adventure's. You are tasked to manage and create food for the town, gather materials for building and forging tools/weapons, and eventually mine beneath the surface and break into dungeons beneath the map. All the while you need to defend your townspeople against invaders, native enemy's and eventually the monsters living within the dungeons.\n\nThe art is very inconsistent. Between block styles, animals and items within the game, there seems to be a 'mish-mash' of different approaches to how things ought to look, and none of them are particularly good. The animation is non existent. Everything glides across the screen, the combat looks like how a child emulate a 'fight' by smashing two dolls together.\n\nGameplay wise, you are allowed to create various structures, however you want. Similar to prison architect and DF-9, the game follows a system where you designate the type of room (bakery or carpenters workshop), and then supply those rooms with the necessary components allow those rooms to function (such as an oven, or bakers table). Buildings can be multiple floors up or down, though rooms are restricted to one level. The AI is what ruins the game for me. Peasants will frequently pick fights with monsters unarmed if they are near them. Like the Majesty, you cannot control the hero's that come to your town, however you also cannot curb or influence the hero's with gold or bounties. You simply have to hope the hero's will go where you need them too on their own.\n\nThe menu's and displays aren't pretty to look at either, and navigating through the various menu's is rather unintuitive.\n\nThe sounds are pretty terrible to be honest, especially the sound for when peasants eat food or die. If you happen to have your earphones on, and at a high volume, I would imagine it would cause your ears to bleed. Overall, the sound effects are pretty generic, but maybe I'm expecting too much from an Indie game after playing Minecraft.\n\nNow at the time, I could just explain such issues away, because the game was still in active development. However the game has since been abandoned by it's developers, and no further updates are planned. Because of that, I can't in good faith recommend this game. There's too much simply missing or unpolished for this to be considered a good purchase.","December 1, 2014","false","5.4"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","1"

Each of said creatures seems to inherently wish to destroy the little "Townies" that inhabit the locale.\n\nThus it is up to you to assign duties and crafts in order to farm, harvest, bake, mine, and provide a kind of economy of barter in order to sustain the townspeople from starving, or being slaughtered and eaten by local denizens.\n\nAfter creating a working village, whether it be in a mountainside or under the ground, or whatever the case, townies can venture below, into the earth to unveil treasures from creatures, with or without the help of heroes attained from local taverns.\n\nWith certain mods, the game can be improved, but what with the care given to it, the modding community has very well moved on; it has been left aside and is a token of proof against the usefullness of buying games before their true completion.\n\nOther games similar to this are Gnomoria, and Stonehearth, both of which brandish better Ai development and offer a team who is in love with the product they are creating.\n\nI would only recommend trying this game if it were on sale at 80% off if you wish to give a town-simulator a try; but I personally would have preferred buying Gnomoria over this game.","December 21, 2015","false","78.8"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

This allows for a deeper playstyle in regards to the land, allowing you to flatten out areas quicker etc. While a nice thing to have, the reason this review is now edited is due to the developers finally getting off their ♥♥♥ and providing an update. On time. If this keeps up, I have hopes once again for Towns. The idea is great, and if it is true we're seeing Xavi once again get to work, then Towns could finally become the game it was advertised as. If you like town building games like Gnormia, Dwarf Fortress etc, Towns is a nice twist that basically is you making a town/city for an adventurer. Imagine your the town that the hero in skyrim comes and visits. The hero might bring enemies with them, among other things, and survival is incredibly hard. This is not an easy game. Only if you like this genre of title and want to spice things up would I suggest buying it CURRENTLY; we will need to see if the developers can keep working on it, lest they fall into their bad habits again. Keep an eye on this review; in the future, it will change as updates come along.\n\n\nMan, I wish they could launch in Early Access retroactively.\n\n\n\n---ORIGINAL---\n\nI entered Towns unknowing of it's past or the community reaction. It looked cool enough, and I thought that I could make towns like the screenshots showed.\n\nBoy was I wrong.\n\nIf you want to spend $15 on this you're not fit to be on Steam let alone have the method of purchasing games. I'm glad I only spent $5 on this mess. Where to start?\n\nThe early game is practically impossible; the tutorials don't cover anything useful and you're villagers will not follow your orders in the right order; you might ask them to build walls to protect themselves then ask them to make a house: The house will be made half way then some random walls will be put in, all the while they run into eachother and get stuck.\n\nLack of food, lack of direction and overall poor controls make this game basically unplayable. You'd have better luck finding a brand new AAA release on %99 discount on Steam than someone who has ever made anything that resembles the screenshots in this awful game. You enter thinking of grand citites: You leave with a tribe of misfits trying to survive in the worst way possible.","November 30, 2013","false","38.6"," 40 of 62 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","40","62","0","0"

This game was released on Greenlight, with the devs claiming that they would continue development. I understood this to mean that I was buying into an alpha that was in development still. The game feels about 40% complete. It's playable, but..\n\n1. The AI is terrible. Both townie and mob.\n2. The way you construct things is really hard to use, reminescent of RCT2 in that the isometric way the roofs tile makes it difficult for you to see if you placed a roof properly or not, but with the added annoyance that you need to have it so that your townies can reach it, so you need to place scaffolds everywhere. It's not fun, it feels like a chore.\n3. The GUI seriously leaves a lot to be desired. Things with no tooltip, weird buttons that do unclear things, annoying flashing notification buttons every single time you pause/unpause..\n4. Complete(or near complete) lack of satisfactory tutorials. It's not extremely hard to grasp like DF is, but there are strange things that I still don't understand, like why the entire underground of the map appears to be a giant dungeon and there is no underground stone.\n5. Bugs.\n6. No where near as much customization is possible as DF has, the environment is basically the same generic map each time.\n\nAll of these things are totally fixable. The problem? The devs have halted development. There hasn't been a patch in several months, no offical posts on the (horrible, echo chamber of a) forum, total silence. They kept complaining about being bogged down by all the work, and being burnt out. Plenty of devs are, but you don't just stop development completely. You take breaks, not quit. Ask people for ideas, don't quit. Open up your code so that others can work on it with you, don't quit.\n\nReally disappointed I supported this project and got a broken, unfinished product.

I've played it a while ago, and I dare say it was a bit better back then than it is now. Development seems to be quite stagnant here. At the end of this review you'll read what I really recommend instead.\n\nThe tutorials are, to say the least, quite braindead. They could've made it more interactive, but as it is now it's quite dull. Some details seems to be badly written as I didn't always get the desired results.\n\nThe military in the game is kind of a joke. If I see a spider or any other enemy, why oh why can't I just go rightclick it and tell the military to go attack it? Or at least something that enables me to make more use of the military than 'patrol there' and hope that they actually will engage the enemy on their patrol routes.\n\nThe actual mining is quite non-intuitive. Somehow I wasn't able to mine certain areas until I moved up/down. It's rather hard to see what level you are at currently, and there are no size indicators in the area you're about to mark to be mined. And you can build a roof but somehow I have not managed to build a roof on top of my shacks. I might give that a try again another time, but the game seems so pointless that it isn't really motivating to.\n\nYou have absolutely no connection with those little guys you're ordering around. You can see some basic stats, but all those little peoples aren't really special. It's lacking a certain something there, and I can't quite place my finger on it. Let's just say that you don't really care who they are, as long as they get the jobs done already. There's no feel of a story attached to it.\n\nAssigning jobs and assigning productions/stockpiles is quite a chore. So much a chore that you just leave everything up to the defaults. A quick overview is rather impossible. Sure, they do have a list of civilians, and a stockpile list. But instead of having it present a clear overview, it's rather a messy job. I think they focused way too much on iconized displays with tiny numbers inside. In cases like this, a table-format would probably make more sense. We want to know some nice numbers and some other stats, not how pretty they look in a circle with one tiny number in there.\n\nSpeaking about iconized displays.. the GUI is very clunky. It is definitely not polished and is just bare bones style. Nothing fancy about it and there are options lacking. The build icons are non-intuitive. If you want to go back a level in the menu, the 'go back' arrow is in a different location every level. So you can't just 'click click click' fast to get to the root level. No, you have to check every time you went back one level in the menu where the back button is at now. Nothing has been streamlined in this game.\n\nIf you are charmed by this kind of game, I can recommend a different one instead which is still in active development and is rather more promising. Take it from me, you want to try Gnomoria. It might be in Early Access, but I've been playing it for a while (on Desura and now also on Steam), and it is way more finished than this Towns ever will be.","January 23, 2014","false","1.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arleas/recommended/221020/","arleas","arleas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arleas/","1379 products in account","Ok, having reviewed the game again, it still seems to me like this is a very hit or miss game.  On the one hand, it's a game with the interesting premise that you're creating a town to attract heroes to fight in the dungeons that are invariably discovered beneath the town.  On the other hand, it's bogged down by horrible micromanagement through clunky menus.\n\nBefore you find yourself running a town worthy of adventurers coming to visit, you have to BUILD the town.  You start with a handful of people standing around with their thumbs up their asses waiting for you to tell them what to do.  You tell them to grab some fruit and put it over there in a patch of ground we'll call a stockpile.  You tell them to chop down trees and put the wood over there in a different stockpile.  You designate certain areas of ground as a room for various purposes and then have to figure out what order you're required to build the furniture for these rooms.\n\nSo you want beds for your people to sleep in?  You're gonna need a carpentry bench in a carpentry zone.  What about food more filling than apples and pears?  I guess you're gonna need a baking table and a baking oven in a baking zone.  But wait; there's something about this baking oven being made out of stone.  Now you're going to need a masonry room and an appropriate table in an appropriate zone.\n\nThis kind of crap takes place all the time in this game. Oh and it's also set to some mind numbing repetitive music barely above "bad midi song" level. The characters themselves aren't very well animated and most might as well be colored stick figures.  I mean, you tell your guys to chop down a tree...do you see them pull out an axe and swing it at the trunk?  No, you see them stand next to a tree for a few minutes while a chopping sound effect is played and then you're treated to your character hauling a log across the map to a stockpile (if you bothered to make one).\n\nThis game has a lot of promise and I've actually had this game since it was "officially released" waiting for it to live up to that promise.  It hasn't done it yet.  Oh and about that official release:  It basically went from alpha to final release overnight.  Had steam's "Early Access" been a thing at the time it would have been a perfect candidate for it.  Instead they released it as if it were done when just a day before it was "alpha" quality...but again, that wasn't really an option for them and they were desperate to make sales.\n\nNow, in the time since the game went "live" on steam to the writing of this review, they've put up a few updates and it does look like they've fixed a few things here and there, but it hasn't changed to the point where I could wholeheartedly say "yes, buy this game!"  It's still got a rough and unfinished feel to it, and if they'd take some time to polish up the UI, add some more variety to the music, and redo most of the graphics, it would at least look like they've made some progress.  Instead it's all "under the hood" stuff with very little outward change from the earliest version on Steam.\n\nIf despite all of this you're still willing to buy the game, yes, you can easily sink 10-20 hours into it (I've almost sunk 20 into it when it was in its most broken state) because you get that feeling that somehow you're slowly making progress in the game and building something.  It's not entirely unsatisfying...it's just not entirely satisfying either.  If you buy it, lower your expectations and I'm sure this game will meet those lowered expecations and maybe even surpass them.  If instead you go into it expecting a great and polished game from the start, you'll be let down hard.","November 26, 2013","false","18.5"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","20","30","0","0"

Random, buggy to where it doesn't always respond to your\ncommands. Everything else plays like someone put it together with a poor copy of RPG maker. I held off reviewing this for a while, because I liked the initial promise...but it has been months and months with nothing of merit added to the game. I can see why the others felt ripped off.\n\nSteer clear until the devs get their act together.","May 5, 2014","false","3.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ruehl21/recommended/221020/","ruehl21","Judal Ruehl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ruehl21/","170 products in account","I've got to say I'm glad I got it when it was on sale. It's definitely more of a $5 game, not a $15 one. If you find this game at $5 or less, then think about it, but any more than that and you might want to find something that got finished. This review is based off of my experience and the regular price though, so overall I don't recommend it. There's no way there isn't better games out there than this.\n\nLet me start with what I found to be good about the game though, since I did technically like it. I never played this Gnomoria that everyone else is mentioning, and with little function in Minecraft for watching a village come to life even with mods, I found it to be a great idea. Even though it was immediately obvious from opening the game that it was far from finished I found myself enjoying finding different combinations and ways of getting my limited villagers to survive.\n\nSecondly, the zoning. By assigning a zone type to an area the area gains a particular function, while losing other functions. This makes building a city kind of cool because the buildings one makes will actually function the way that they've zoned it to. Added to the fact that, if one could figure out the menus easily, one could get the villagers to use and upkeep these zones automatically, without any help from the player.\n\nThen there's just the world in general. Although the maps are small, they generate well, and they're fun and easy to shape. If a player shows enough patience, it actually is possible to build the kinds of places they show in the promotional material and screenshots.\n\nThe last thing I thought was really cool was being able to put writing on tombstones and books and things. I can go through my village and remind myself of the events that passed. Who died, who did the best, or helped the most – it felt like making a civilization, even though it was really just a town at best. Epic legacies in a tiny town.\n\nNow, the wonderful negatives that ruined it. Unfortunately there are a lot of these, so I'll put a chunk of them in point form;\n*Odd menu style. That took a while to get used too, and I feel like things could be implemented better.\n*Moving items is a hassle, or just plain confusing.\n*Can't place enough text in books, graves, signs, etc, and can't use characters like “/”, making labels and text look flat and odd, like they were written by some 10 year old that was too lazy to use any punctuation. Breaks immersion.\n*The use of scaffold isn't clearly stated to be useful, and so it can be difficult to find out about it and how to use it properly to build better buildings. There isn't a lot of direct help on the internet either, so simply building can be a hassle. Also, making second floors is too tricky.\n*Extremely limited character sprites. Everyone will have too many clones for you to care about them. They also all have weird french-sounding names, even if playing the English version, and though unimportant, feels like it takes away from immersion into the game.\n*The armour doesn't fit on the sprites properly. Sometimes this is funny, but it just isn't proper for a game that costs $15.\n*The first floor dungeons, though easy to pass, are too expansive and too full of monsters. There's no easing into it at all, making the game feel less thought-out and more slapped together. Also an immersion breaker.\n*Next to no updates. These people probably don't care anymore, and it's showing. They don't update anywhere near as much as they should, and some of the bugs in the game could really use some fixes.\n*The bugs. Seriously, the game is definitely not a finished product. Amusing, but certainly not finished.\n\nAnd lastly, though kind of silly, what I found to be the game-breaker;\nThe weapons you make, buy, and find are cool and all, but it isn't hard for some "hero" to waltz by and take all your good stuff, leaving your citizens and soldiers pretty close to defenceless. Some heroes. I worked hard on that stuff. “That hat was for the blacksmith!” and “she needed that spear to save her life!” might become alarmingly common frustrations.\n\nSo yeah. Ends up under $5? It'll amuse you long enough. $15? It's cute, but it ain't that cute, just go back to your Minecraft mods and this "Gnomoria" everyone else is talking about.","January 9, 2014","false","16.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Read the REVIEWS of the game and disregard the forums (since Yetichow had decided to scrub them clean and ban any who disagree).\n\nCongratulations, Towns.  You made it into the Steam group, "ScamReport".  You should be proud...\n\n(/sarcasm)\n\n****March 2015 Update****\n\nI wouldn't bother checking the forums for any kind of clarity.  The current moderator bans anyone who criticizes the game, despite there being valid reasons to criticize.  Only the positive forum posts don't get edited or deleted.  Anyone trying to warn potential buyers on the actual status of the game, gets banned.\n\nWe were told that development had picked up again (for the fourth time of it being active and then subsequently stopped) but after only a month-ish, the current moderator stated the developer was having house renovations done and did not have regular internet access.  That was in September of 2014.\n\nMake your own judgement call from that...\n\n---------------------------------\n**** Initial Review ****\n\nVoted to Greenlight the game WAY back and upon it's release on Steam, I was excited to buy it.\n\nImagine my shock when the game I loaded up was nothing more than a poorly coded alpha with a crap tutorial and a laundry list of game-breaking bugs.\n\nAccording to the Devs, the game was fulling finished and wasn't in alpha/beta/whatever.  Fully finished. Fully playable.  With continued updates scheduled!\n\nPlease note:  There was no demo released at the time.  NOWHERE on the page did it state that the game was feature incomplete (which is STILL is).  And then customers started voicing their concerns.  They (myself included) were met with insults from the PR/Devs directly (anyone remember TommyKent's abrasion?).  We were called stupid for not "understanding" how these type of games are to played.   That "if we just gave it time" we'd figure it all out.\n\nScrew that.\n\nEven over a year later, the game has only had a handful of crappy updates - most not even addressing major issues.  We've been told the entire run of excuses from health problems, to vacations, to quitting programmers (who left to work on other projects! AWESOME!)\n\nAvoid this like the plague.  It was a cash grab.  They're millionaires now (not exaggerating) and they're never coming back to save this wreck of a game.\n\nMatter of fact, avoid anything SMP does.

I know it's not the popular opinion here, but I have spent a happy 300+ hours building and exploring and fighting. It was well worth the $10 or so that I spent on it a few years ago.\n\nIn Towns, you are in charge of an idiotic band of Townies who you instruct to gather resources, build buidlings, craft luxuries, cook food, and defend the town both as soldiers and civilains. In addition to keeping you populace well-fed and happy, you must defend against raiding bands of villians while delving deep into the dangerous underground to find more stone, iron, and gold. You can entice heroes to come and help you or instead swarm the monsters with well-armed townsfolk. The gameplay is heavy in resource management and building but has a satisfying amount of fighting and exploring.\n\nWhy are the reviews so negative? This game long been public and under development, and that development stalled and then eventually halted. There are lists of features yet to be implemented and bugs to be fixed. Many believe that Towns is an unfinished game and are very angry about this. My interpretation is that the developers were just too ambitious about what to include and ended up with lots of great features that don't all function perfectly. I think it's finished, just not polished.\n\nSo despite my positive review, buyer beware. Play a demo if you can. Think about what bugs get under your skin and what you are happy to ignore while exploring the game mechanics. Think about how many hours or what level of gameplay you need to shell out some cash.

Basically they just took the cash and ran. I'd like to say some really nasty things about that, but that would be pointless.\n\nLots of playtime pre-Steam. Game still has most the bugs it did when it was alpha. IMO the biggest bug is that your people work themselves to death, literally, they forget to eat and starve. Got one town up to 70 population, only to see them starve to death in the next 2 hours to to 5. After that I deleted it, being that was the upteenth town that did that.\n\nOne of the patches made all the townies rock climbers, so you only need the first set of stairs. And then you get to watch them all race down into to the depths, to fight and die. Heroes are the ones that are supposed to go fight the monsters, not your townies. Once you've collected all that loot and minerals, you're left thinking, what do I do with it. Since there really isn't much to make, I think there's only 1 item made out of gold. So you have that hero running around with that wooden sword you made because he's too stupid to pick up that magical sword that was found. So usually one of your townies will equip it. You can tell them what to equip, but it's a click fest just to get it done. Your townies are kinda stupid too, they just drop everything on the ground rather then put it into containers that are right next to them (that was also int he alpha).\n\nWant to have more fun? Turn on sieges and get wiped out before you even make that the second crafting table your need. Last time I played with siege's on (that's where the monsters can attack you town up top, not counting what the heroes pull to your town), I had just made my first workstation, and here came the spiders, they killed off most of my townies and then the rest of them were wiped out by the next 2 sieges that were 5 minutes apart.\n\nGames are supposed to be fun and keep the player active and interested. This game doesn't do that. This is also the only game I know of where the player is penalized for being active. So if you're constanly giving them orders, none will show up. I used to go watch tv so they could have 'idle time.\n\nI heard that there was a patch that came out for this. From what I understood of it, it did minor fixes and made it playable on some other OS so they could suck more money from unsuspecting buyers.\n\nHow strange my original review of this poor game disappeared. Might have been deleted by the devs due to me stating that they have a new game they want you to buy. I forget the name of that one. However I intend to avoid anything these guys work on it the future if I possibly can. They abandoned this  BETA because they got bored and started playing the blame game. Who's to say they won't do it again. One dev even bragged in the Steam forums that he took a months vacation in South America from the profits.  How about finishing the game?\n\nSo if you want a game that penalizes you, gets boring, frustrating and is incomplete, go ahead and buy this.","July 23, 2014","false","48.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

My villagers can go all the way down to the bottom of my mine before needing to come back up again to eat, and since your town can experience hunger lock (Where you don't have any food at all and all villagers can't do anything due to starvation), expect a massive kill off if your food supply ever dwindles to an incredibly low number.\n\nThere was a lot of potential behind this game, enough potential that I threw my money behind it back in 2011. Sadly, that potential will never be truly realized since its own developers and the last man working on this game gave up on it. If there ever is a Towns 2, I will not buy it due to the lack of interest the developers had in the first game.","July 1, 2014","false","102.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Nothing seems to work quite as intended, the UI is a little finicky, mouse clicks don't always register in the right place (if at all), and digging is a nightmare. The further down you dig, the more erratic the mouse behavior becomes.\n\nAt 15$, I'd say the price is steep -- comparing to Minecraft, which released at a similar price, the level of functionality is far less. Though then again, the requisite functionality is far greater in the case of Towns. However, this game is flawed for a far simpler reason, it was released onto steam with no notice that it was an unfinished, alpha game -- I'm an alpha-player, I love to play and watch as a game evolves, and I am _more likely_ to purchase an alpha game than many non-alpha games. I know many of my friends feel the same way, but  this game released to steam (via Greenlight) purporting to be a fully-ready 1.0 release, and that's just not what it is.\n\nI say wait. Maybe get it if the price drops to the 2-5$ range. It has potential to be quite good, if the development continues, but everything about the more general practice smells of a smash and grab on my wallet, and I don't much care for it.\n\n\nWeak accept on potential, Strong Reject on Honesty.","December 31, 2012","false","1.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The tutorials were shamefully unhelpful, the gameplay was unintuitive, and the art style was unique but lead to an overall crude feel due to the games clunky play.\n\nAs time has passed I'd expected this game to get refined some and updated to assauge some of the issues I had...but to this date the progress has been glacially slow and it remains the same lump of an overcomplicated mess that it always was.  Perhaps I'm being overly spiteful given my own impressions, but I can't for the life of me find any redeeming features about this game after it has remained the same awful product for so long.\n\nIt's possible that you might enjoy this game, but I would heartily advise in-depth research about it, if not choosing a different product outright.","December 6, 2013","false","2.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Another person took up development but was being paid basically nothing so dropped it.\n\nThe game is a fun little survival game that was very promising, and it was fun to play. However, at it's current level, it's only slightly better than those island survivial building flash games online. It's fun for a while, but gets boring.\n\nCost: £10\nPlaytime: 50 hours\n£ / hour: £0.20\n\nGameplay: 5 / 10\nPlot: 4 / 10\nGraphics: 3 / 10\nReplayability: 6 / 10\nCommunity: NA\nCost-Effectiveness: 4 / 10\n\n=========================\nOverall: 2 / 10 (No future updates)\n=========================","December 9, 2015","false","47.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

After all, the screenshots showed some very epic looking towns, and the game wasn't in the Early Access category. (meaning it wasn't an alpha/beta, but rather a full release)\nBoy was I in for a surprise.. and not the good kind.\n\nI can sum up this game in one single word - Awful.\n\nThere was barely a tutorial involved, so I had no idea what I was doing.  I started up a game and within minutes my villagers with their fantastic AI decided to disregard all common sense and took it in turns to throw themselves at a monster, resulting in most of my population dying right away.  Those who survived died of starvation a few in-game days later because I had no idea how I was meant to feed them, despite throwing food down right infront of them.\nThe game is filled with bugs, and there's been very little care and attention given to the game from the devs.  They've tried to pass off this game as being a full release, yet it's clearly still in alpha stage.  There's been many players complaining and demanding answers from the devs, but their cries seem to fall upon deaf ears.  Now that the devs have made a cool $2mil from this game, they couldn't care less, and it clearly shows.\n\nDon't buy this game, not even for a laugh/joke.  These developers don't deserve any of your money.","November 25, 2013","false","1.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dj_moyer/recommended/221020/","dj_moyer","dj_moyer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dj_moyer/","74 products in account","The bottom line:  This game has an interesting premise.  Rather than casting you as the hero who goes into the dungeons in search of fame and glory, you are in charge of building and organizing the town above the dungeon where the hero rents his hotel room and buys his weapons.  That said, this game really isn't as much fun as it sounds.  It is an extensive exercise in MICRO-MANAGEMENT.  If you can get it for REALLY REALLY CHEAP, then it's worth playing if you enjoy games like the original Warcraft (the original, not WoW!!) or Sim City.  I have to say though, I am not a fan of any game where the townsfolk will starve to death if you just leave them alone for a while.\n\nYou start out with a handful of citizens and absolutely no town.  Your first 4 hours of play will be dedicated to gathering food and setting up a farm so your citizens don't starve to death (which they will do QUITE OFTEN if you are not paying attention!!).  Your next 6 hours of play will be dedicated to mining a few piles of rock and mud, chopping down a few trees, and building some basic workshops for your citizens to work in.  Then you'll spend another 3 hours setting up a kitchen and a bakery, as well as some animal farms so your people can eat something besides apples.  Only after that will you worry about building a tavern for traveling heroes to stay and eat at.  And only after THAT will you start digging down into the dungeon.  Digging into the dungeon and having a tavern with at least one open tavern bedroom are the requirements for heroes to start coming to your town.  Different types of heroes will come based on how deep into the dungeon you are, how many people live in your town, and what type of furniture you have in the tavern bedroom.  Once you do get into the dungeons, there are a ton of monsters which will probably kill everyone who finds their way down the  tunnel.  But there are more resources in the dungeon that you can't find on the surface, like iron, copper, silver, and gold... and you need a ton of those to build better weapons and armor for your city guards.  Meanwhile, you might randomly have a Werepig go berserk on your town and KILL EVERYONE, or you might have a sudden invasion by monsters from the forest and THEY ALL DIE.  But NEVER FORGET... the number one priority AT ALL TIMES has to be food production or else your entire city will starve because the citizens are as stupid as rocks.\n\nOne good thing about this game is that it is VERY EASY to create mods for it.  You can mess with the amount and placement of various resources, enemies, even mountains and plants.  If you want to get deeper into the config files, you can even change the number of citizens you start with, alter citizen and hero attributes, and even alter enemies to make them easier or harder.","December 14, 2014","false","61.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Apparently the developer has now abandoned the game, leaving it half finished. Complete rip-off; there is no way this should be on sale without an "Early Access" tag, and seeing as it will now likely never be finished it is difficult to see how even that would be fair advertising. Buggy, unbalanced, and with many obvious missing features; it compares badly with many games currently available in the same genre, many cheaper and some free.\n\nCurrent price is £9.99, which is insane- almost twice the current price of Gnomoria.

Let's not kid ourselves- Greenlit games are often half-built engines that never see the light of further development. But this takes the cake. Left sitting here alone since 2013, this game had promise, but was only ever a simple town simulator- and not even a good one. I'm personally so tired of paying for games to be developed in hopes my money will be put to use creating something amazing, and while this had some direction and potential, in the end it was abandoned and we were all quite honestly ♥♥♥♥ed for supporting it.

I played this game before it came out on steam (so my hours played is wrong), i was in an area with no internet and had a new computer so i only had towns installed because it looked like a promising game; with awesome stuff to build, nice customization (many blocks and armours) and a cool endgame with adventurers helping your town, but after some hours of playing i'd rather just look at a plain wall for three days.\n\nThe stuff you see in the screenshots are quite "end game", even the most simple structures, your "townies" will most often sleep eat and work outside because you won't be bothered building houses because the building system is VERRY frustrating because:\n1. Your townies do not indicate whether or not they can build something unlike Dwarf-Fortress and Gnomoria and your townies can't reach ♥♥♥♥.\n2. Most building-blocks require some weird-♥♥♥♥ items like slime "stuff" (can't remember name and this game is to horible to back and look) to make some stone bricks. Why? I don't know but it hampers creativity.\n3. You can't build floors unlike DF or Gnomoria so every story you add you need an extra layer just for floors (this may have canged, it was a long time since i played)\n\nThere is a solution for the reatching problem and that is "scafolding" a block that can be stood upon, walked troug and climbed up. it's completley free so it feels like cheating using it. In other games that adds a scafolding sort of thing they usually cost resorces because scafolding tends to be realy good for moving around. The scafolding tool has been dubed a "god tool" by the comunity because it is realy OP. Other god tools are things like the ability to drop lava anywhere on the map.\n\nAt least you can get a lot of hours out of this game, but i would definetly NOT recomend it. Go play Gnomoria (that is 2 euros cheaper), DF (that is free) or any other city builder but definatly DO NOT play Towns.","June 13, 2014","false","5.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Something better or newer will come out to take it's place.\n\nThe developer insisted that the product is playable upon time of release, after Early Access was terminated. While the game was playable, the words were decieiving. A playable game should not be released if there are still countless bugs to be fixed and several key features that have not been added to the game.\n\nIt's such a shame, because the game had great potential and an idea for a somewhat unique mechanic. But I can't recommend this game to anyone, unless you are looking for examples of how a good concept can go bad, learn the idea, and take time to figure out how to improve upon it with your own game.

Now, there are so many new drugs coming out every day, that Gaben has to ask his community, "What new drugs should we offer at the pharmacy?"\n\nThe community heard some neat things about this Townsicol, a do-everything drug. Gaben can only assume that his community knows what they want, even though they don't often know how to get the information about the pharmaceutical companies that made the drug, at least not as profieciently as Gaben. The people assure Gaben that yes, we want Townsicol in the pharmacy!\n\nSo Gaben orders Townsicol, even though it hasn't gone through proper FDA qualifications.\n\nThe people buy up their prescriptions of their new drug and GOSH!

It has ripped off too many people.\n\nTowns is a game about building a village for simulated RPG adventurers. Reading about all the features it had and all the downloads, I figured I would throw in my $5 and play. This is 2013 by the way. Unfortunately, the game was unplayable. With a glitchy interface and the inability to even pass the tutorial or even build one room.\n\nA few months passed from August 2013 and Steam decides to release Green Light, I service indicating which games are incomplete but still up for purchase. To my surprise, Towns was lumped into the newly founded category. Basically, I bought a game I did not know was incomplete. The optimistic side of me thought that Towns would be complete some time in the future.\n\nFast forward a year to 2014 and I see news that Towns developers gave up on ever finishing the game. Meaning they simply took off with my money.\n\nhttp://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/217154/Alphafunded_Steam_game_Towns_abandoned_by_devs.php\n\nUpon hearing the news, I was again disappointed.\n\nThe following year, Steam released a refund policy. I was excited to read that they would allow refunds that were within 14 days with less than one hour of play time. Given that I have clocked a whopping, miserable 19 minutes on Towns, I figured I could do one last attempt.... DENIED.\n\nSo here I am, writing about how much I have been ripped off from buying the game Towns. It was $5 sure, but I didn't know it was incomplete at the time and Steam fails to acknowledge their mistake.\n\nI hope this is the right forum to post to because quite frankly, I feel people should know the darker side that is Steam.\n\nMoral of the story.\n\nDO NOT BUY TOWNS","October 14, 2015","false","0.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It has ripped off too many people.\n\nTowns is a game about building a village for simulated RPG adventurers. Reading about all the features it had and all the downloads, I figured I would throw in my $5 and play. This is 2013 by the way. Unfortunately, the game was unplayable. With a glitchy interface and the inability to even pass the tutorial or even build one room.\n\nA few months passed from August 2013 and Steam decides to release Green Light, I service indicating which games are incomplete but still up for purchase. To my surprise, Towns was lumped into the newly founded category. Basically, I bought a game I did not know was incomplete. The optimistic side of me thought that Towns would be complete some time in the future.\n\nFast forward a year to 2014 and I see news that Towns developers gave up on ever finishing the game. Meaning they simply took off with my money.\n\nhttp://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/217154/Alphafunded_Steam_game_Towns_abandoned_by_devs.php\n\nUpon hearing the news, I was again disappointed.\n\nThe following year, Steam released a refund policy. I was excited to read that they would allow refunds that were within 14 days with less than one hour of play time. Given that I have clocked a whopping, miserable 19 minutes on Towns, I figured I could do one last attempt.... DENIED.\n\nSo here I am, writing about how much I have been ripped off from buying the game Towns. It was $5 sure, but I didn't know it was incomplete at the time and Steam fails to acknowledge their mistake.\n\nI hope this is the right forum to post to because quite frankly, I feel people should know the darker side that is Steam.\n\nMoral of the story.\n\nDO NOT BUY TOWNS","October 14, 2015","false","0.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

They have dropped the game, and decided to come back, more often than i can believe. The very fact that they decided to drop it even once says a lot. The fact that the hired help, decided to jump ship, because he found out.. there wasn't going to be much of a pay check, says a lot. This is very much a "buyer beware". The game isn't finished. The game according to some news feeds is never going to be finished, and yet the games forums (not steam) says they've decided to work on it...

I bought this game in beta and was excited to see how it would come out.  I guess I bought it on the last update, because there have been no more and now I hear that this game has been dropped from production.  I am dissapointed in the devs for throwing out what could be a potential classic, and I'm mad at steam for selling me a game that is still being made, then allowing the game to stop.  I had fun with it and if anything I think the modding community will pick up where the devs left off and give this game the polish it deserves.  I had fun with it and I tend to play it for days straight then don't play it for months then give it a few days again.  I would only reccomend this game if you are into modding, otherwise save your money because it is far from perfect, yet close, but at some times it's not even good, if that makes any sense.","February 26, 2014","false","94.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Infact, since there is no ingame help of any kind, you will be going to the internet to figure out some mechanics of this game.\n\nVillager path finding is always shortest route, regardless of danger. Hostile NPC's do have random and specific spawns, but more often then not I feel they are hunting me down.\n\nBuilding is somewhat confusing till you get the hang of it. The only drawback is, if you don't build in small sections the game seems to hang on larger designs. The same goes for most the resource managment. Even after giving out specific jobs, and setting priority's all my villagers do is eat and sleep.\n\nFact is, this game has loads of pontential. But fails to deliver. At best this feels like an Alpha Version of a game.\n\nI do not recommend this game.","April 5, 2014","false","78.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Where did all the reviews go? Wow. Starting on a blank slate here, maybe?\n\nLet's be honest: The premise of Towns is as quirky as it is unique: You build a fantasy town OVER a monster-filled dungeon, so that heroes will come and explore said dungeon- and with your town being endared by the monsters but at the same time able to provide important services to the heroes the game clearly has a tongue-in-cheek approach to both town-building and fantasy tropes in general.\n\nLet's be honest: This is an early access game. So you can expect it isn't done yet. It allows you to build a diverse range of buildings and services, and heroes do occasionally pop up and do their thing, and yes, there are monsters.\nAnd that is the catch, the premise is really interesting but at this stage, the features that are in don't make for a very interesting game.","April 21, 2014","false","21.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a game breaking flaw.\n2: If you have harvesting set as a higher priority than cooking, your peope will eat the raw food instead of cooking it.\n3: If you have item crafting set as a higher priority than chopping, your people will often times not bother to chop trees in tree farm to make stiff with.\n4: After a couple hours of game play, your people will only do the top 2 or 3 proprity chores, and ignore everything else.\n5: Never cook anything that requires 2 or more different ingrediants. People will often times stoop what they are doing, and the ingrediants they are "holding" dissapears.\n6: People often times drop what they are carrying and go do somethign else.\n7: People will almost neve use a stock pile or container, reguardless of how close by it is.\n8: Some times people stop doing a chore, and what ever they have in their "hands" dissapears.\n9: There are no sprite animations for sleeping, sitting down, fighting, chopping, harvesting, or doing chores.\n10: The AI is too stupid to eat when hungry most of the time. If cooking and gathering are not your 2 top prioritys, your entire population will eventually starve to death.\n11: An infinate loop of "gathering - cooking - eating" happens WAY too often, mostly caused by the short hunger cycle. This happens reguardless how filling the food is.\n12: Raw and prepared food containers do not work.\n\nI just bought this game yesterday, and have been spending many hours tryng to figure out how to play the game around all the issues.\nI want my wasted time back.\n","January 26, 2014","false","43.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
