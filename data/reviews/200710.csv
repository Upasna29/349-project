You are not just selling everything to the vendor but you find stuff that you can use and come up with different combinations for your characters like maybe an embermage that carries a gun and a shield or a traditional weapon like a staff or even two wands. Simple put: the itemization in the game is enormous! There are skill trees available that offer numerous different builds. For example, I started with an embermage and went all +Ice damage. But then I added some fire gear and spells and now I have a completely unique spell build that just makes me want to create another embermage to try out different combinations.\n\nThe only thing that I am not a big fan of is the art work and bright color scheme of the game. At first it wasn't my cup of tea per say but it actually does work well for the style of story they are presenting the customers/gamers.\n\nIt's extremely well done. There is no Auction House or Real Money Auction House. It is the standard for an ARPG and what a game should be.","December 1, 2013","true","189.3"," 494 of 565 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","494","565","0","30"

See Conclusion\nNOTE: Related ContentAlso see my:\nTorchlight (1) Review\n\nINTRODUCTION:Torchlight II is an isometric action Role-Playing Game developed and published by Runic Games who's composed of developers from popular titles such as Fate and the Diablo (1 and 2). This game was designed to resurrect the old school dungeon crawler genre adding to it a fresh coat of paint and an attempt to quench the thirst for the classical isometric experience. True to the formula on what made the first Torchlight great, Torchlight 2 is one of the better Dungeon Crawler / Top-Down Action RPG available in the market.\n\nPLOT (No Spoilers):The game takes place several years after the first game. The Alchemist, one of the three original heroes, gets corrupted by the Heart of Odrak, the monster that was the source of evil that plagued the small town of Torchlight. The Alchemist, wearing new power armor and wielding the Heart of Odrak, destroys the town and sets out on a mysterious quest that would, if not stopped, eventually disrupt the flow of nature and interrupt the delicate balance of power in the world.\n\nPROS:+ Classic gameplay with nice little tweaks to fit the modern age of gaming\n+ Colorful Graphics\n+ Good level variation and environment design\n+ New classes and a much more varied choices for pets\n+ Much more complex skill tree: This is a good new addition from the first game. More complex and more specialized player builds are sure to come up.\n+ Good re-playability: Lots of characters, lots of builds and lots of loot.\n+ Multiplayer option that was absent in the first game\n+ Better end game content\n+ PC hardware friendly\n+ Steam Workshop Support\n+ Does not require 24 hour internet connection to play.\n\nCONS:- Inferior voice acting: -Unlike Diablo II who had very good dialogue and memorable quotes.\n- Inconsistent volume levels on dialogue: -background music can sometimes drown NPC voices.\n- Confusing Story: -The story isn't immersive enough to keep you interested. Story is also very difficult to comprehend without paying close attention and references.\n- Inconsistent Difficulty: -Normal is extremely easy that you will probably get bored the moment you get some of your more powerful skills/spells. Hard and Elite however are extremely difficult that it would make a frustrating experience to the casual gamer. I would recommend playing at Hard since I believe that getting a better challenge is much more acceptable than getting bored.\n- Connecting to multiplayer can sometimes be difficult\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME, GREAT BUY and comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n\nWORTH IT?:Whether this game is at full price or on a sale, this game is worth your money.\n\nFINAL NOTES:Torchlight 2 is a great spiritual successor to the classic Diablo games that provides a good alternative to the Always-Online Diablo 3 experience (specially if you're only looking for a Singleplayer or Local play.)\n\nWORTH IT?:This is a MUST BUY and MUST TRY title for both fans of the classic isometric RPG games and new players alike.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

And I still hold this opinion to be very true in a lot of ways - for example, Titan Quest, while initally intriguing, became a hellish repetitive single-player slog through to the end that, after 20-something hours of playtime, left me exhasted and scarred. Torchlight, however, surpised me. Perhaps it has something to do with the well-designed classes that aren't quite as derivative as many Diablo-clones, or the deep levelling system that allows so much variation within the same class, or the well-honed difficulty scaling that makes you feel like you're always growing, or perhaps it's all these features combined that make this game stand out.\n\nThe controls are intuitive and the mechanics of the game are well-implimented. The enemies are numerous and varied, and there's always surprises to be found in every corner of the randomly-generated maps. The champions and bosses are similarly frequent in appearance, a factor which helps to eliminate that feeling that you're just grinding a way, wasting time until you fight a boss battle. In saying that, playing this game on single player, I did feel like I was taking part in the occasional grind through enemies and loot and levels, which bordered on tedious at time, but playing with a friend and sharing that burden eliminated that feeling entirely.\n\nOn the topic of multiplayer, I felt that it could have been slightly better implimented, in that, for one, it took forever for my friend and I to find each other in the server screen, and there was a bug that occasionally stopped us from adding one another without a full game restart. Also, unlike the Borderlands games (the pinnacle of intuitive multiplayer connectivity in my opinion), you cannot see what missions your partner has to do, so you're contantly relying on them telling you what they're up to (via text chat, if you don't have steam chat), and if you're more advanced than your partner, then any enemies that you've killed won't reappear for your partner, regardless of who is hosting the server. Although I'm sure there's a reason for these issues, they seem like really bizarre features to omit from the game. I mean, sure, you may get a tad overpowered if you're allowed to kill creatures a second time round, but is that really worse than your partner being forced to wade through a sea of emptiness, constantly underpowered due to lack of combat? In any case, all I can recommend is that you start multiplayer games at exactly the same time.\n\nTorchlight 2 is a well-made, deep and enjoyable experience, especially with friends, that separates itself enough from other Diablo clones to really stand at the top of the pile.","November 25, 2013","true","20.2"," 285 of 328 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","285","328","0","0"

Over the years many have tried to emulate the success of the Diablo franchise - but sadly - most got mired in muck and then were promptly forgotten about! Anyone remember Space Siege, Silverfall or Legend: Hand of God? No, I didn't think so.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=160522926\nBoth Diablo and Torchlight share more in common than you would initially think when looking past both games visual representations. Where Diablo is the dark and broody Grand-Daddy of lootin' action RPG'S, Torchlight is its more quirky, colorful and humorous idiot son. That doesn't, however, make Torchlight the inferior of the two by any long stretch. Torchlight and Diablo both come from the same lineage, sharing many senior developers who developed both titles over the course of the last 25 years and this clearly explains why it's the most successful action RPG outside of Diablo. Sure - Iron Lore came pretty close with Titan Quest but until Runic Games formed and gave us the first Torchlight there wasn't much of a success rate for these kinds of games at all. As deceptively simple as they are to the naked eye getting the balance right between clicking, looting and progressing has proven to be more than just a challenge to other game development houses out there who tried to jump onto the action RPG bandwagon.\n\nTorchlight II does very little to tinker with what makes the genre so popular and often sticks so closely to the design-blue print that was Diablo II that it even mimics its explorable areas (forest, desert and swampy marshland). Once again the story is a whole hog of mumbo-jumbo that most will have forgotten once they leave the starting area. This is the series only real short-coming as I can distinctly remember being thoroughly entertained by the cut-scene narrative that drove Diablo and Diablo II forward but I can't say the same for Torchlight and its flimsy paper thin plot I could jot down on a napkin. I know that it can be argued that one really doesn't need much narrative when it comes to this genre but a little would go a long way in keeping me invested. Runic drops the ball here again and I am still sitting here trying to remember what was the whole point and whether I really care to recount it.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=295789096\nTorchlight II's release was also surrounded by a more portentous event that almost shadowed everything gaming that year - the much anticipated 12-year-long-in-the-tooth-wait for the return of Diablo in Diablo III. While many initially thought it would be suicide going against Diablo III in the same quarterly release calendar , history sometimes favors the underdog and while Torchlight II got showered with praise from critics and gamers alike, Diablo III got publicly mauled for its new and improved skill-trees, its always online requirement - even when playing single player, the MMO-styled Auction House and its next-to-never loot drop of rare and unique items.\n\nYou could argue that Torchlight II was the better game upon release for giving gamers everything they wanted from this genre - even including a LAN option which is always a welcome addition - but after a few heads being rolled at Camp Blizzard, Diablo III has slowly evolved into a finer form than the disaster it initially was and it's for this reason I actually enjoyed Diablo III more than Torchlight II but that's just personal taste because Torchlight II is still a blistering sequel that manages to capture pretty much everything about what makes these kinds of games the addictive experience they are.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=150512740\nIt's also worth noting that Torchlight 2 comes with Steamworks Workshop mod integration and since release the community has been bustling away making user-generated content that whilst I haven't personally tried out is sure to keep the game going for a number more years before Runic attempt a sequel. So gear up and get your clicking finger ready because Torchlight II is a resounding success!\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","August 7, 2014","true","70.0"," 282 of 341 people (83%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","83","282","341","8","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/200710/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Let's be completely honest, Torchlight was a Diablo clone. Nothing odd about that either, seeing as both Max Schaefer and Erich Schaefer worked on the game - both once members of Blizzard North, the team behind Diablo and Diablo 2. So, basically, Runic Games returned to the same formula, polished it up a bit, incorporated a few cool features and voila - a new RPG was born. As Torchlight 2 boldly steps onto the contemporary gaming scene, ready to tackle heavy competition (well, mostly Diablo 3) we are immediately drawn into its simple and yet incredibly compelling gameplay mechanics.\n\nTorchlight 2 commences several years after the conclusion of the original game. The Ember Blight has corrupted the Alchemist. The Ember Blight originates from an ancient evil entity known as the Heart of Ordrak, which is the very source corruption beneath the small town of Torchlight. Your task is to put a stop to this evil, which threatens to disrupt the balance between the six elements of the world.\n\nSimplicity is the key, as you'd imagine. Torchlight 2 takes a similar approach to storytelling as Diablo 3. There isn't much of a plot or any exceptionally interesting characters to draw you away from the gameplay. To be honest though, Diablo 3 does have a better story than Torchlight 2, but I guess that's beside the point. Slashing your way through countless foes is the main drive here, so essentially, you'll be on familiar ground if you've been playing Diablo 3 in recent months. There's nothing wrong with borrowing Diablo's mechanics, particularly in T2's case, because Runic has really polished this one to perfection. Everything works smoothly. There are no hiccups during combat or exploration that would warrant any major concern.\n\nThere are four character classes to choose from. The Engineer (Railman in Torchlight), who represents a heavy fighter suitable for melee combat, the Outlander who employs magic and ranged weapons, The Berserker who's quick and agile and often uses animal-based powers and, last but not least, the Embermage, who mainly resorts to powerful spells. The combat differs according to the class you choose. For the single-player playthrough, I selected the Engineer and it was fun all the way. The fact that this is a character focused on close combat doesn't mean that you can't make use of certain magical abilities and scrolls that can be picked up along the way.\n\nThis goes for other classes too. So, apart from your default class-based skills, you also get a chance to use a range of useful spells that can help you heal or improve your character's abilities like movement, marksmanship etc. Players have one basic attack, a secondary attack and an additional powerful attack that deals extra damage - providing the charge meter is filled up. The more it fills up, the more damage you can cause with this attack. Usually, the best way to handle groups of enemies is striking when the charge meter is maxed out, giving you the edge in combat (even when you're massively outnumbered).\n\nThe game is likely to hook players straight away, largely thanks to its appealing loot system. There's an impressive variety of items on display and ready for players to make use of. Exploring as much of the map as possible is the key to this game. Locating hidden areas and defeating stronger enemies is often enormously rewarding. Taking your time to sort your gear to suit your play style is what the whole thing is about. For instance, items like swords, axes and staffs may come in socketed variants, so you have to decide which chips, shards and gems to attach (depending on which enemies you're facing). In addition, the same item can then be enhanced by visiting the Enchanter in the local town. Certain armor and weaponry may hold class-specific traits, so you need to keep your eyes peeled for those.\n\nThe game is enjoyable both in solo and multiplayer modes. There's nothing more satisfying than taking on hordes of baddies with friends and things can really heat up in Torchlight 2. Several cool boss encounters await players and the really cool bit ensues when friends join together, mixing different abilities to take these large opponents down. There are certain impracticalities in multiplayer such as having difficulties finding sessions created by friends. This may prove annoying if you want to jump smoothly and quickly into a co-op game. However, as soon as things kick off, Torchlight 2 becomes a barrel of fun in multiplayer.\n\nThe graphics have been significantly improved since the release of the original. The cartoonish-style art looks great, while every area in the game was meticulously designed and, of course, enriched with Matt Uelmen's eerie Diablo-inspired tracks. Matt is the renowned video game composer, best known for his brilliant darkish Diablo and Diablo 2 melodies. Subtle touches, like beautifully animated background details, create an eye-catching atmosphere. Also, we salute the animation team that brought all those cute little monsters to life and were responsible for a variety of cool-looking spells to boot.\n\nTorchlight 2 is an experience you can't easily walk away from. The combat is the beating heart of the game. It's simple and incredibly fun. Commendably, Runic improved everything they possibly could in this one. As I've already said, I witnessed sharper and more colorful visuals, in addition to a delicious multiplayer mode that allows up to six players (a highly compelling feature not present in the first title). This is quite simply an action RPG that has everything for both fans and newcomers to the genre. Don't miss out on it.","February 7","true","130.5"," 94 of 96 people (98%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","98","94","96","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/200710/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nTorchlight II is a dungeon crawler game that lets you chose to play as a few different classes. The basic concept is the same as nearly all dungeon crawlers:  Explore, level up, find gear, beat the boss, rinse and repeat.\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  Oh no! the alchemist is going to bring about the end of the world! You there, unnamed random hero, it's your job to warn everyone, and be just a few steps behind the alchemists defiling touch.\nAs I implied, you're obviously the hero, the villain you will be trying to catch is known as "the alchemist", whom has been corrupted and destroys all that is in his way.\n\nGame Play: I sense that most dungeon crawlers are time consuming on purpose, I spent a good 30-40 hours before I beat the game, then I kept playing for another 30 hours to get to max level, and at that point I stopped playing.\nThe whole dungeon crawler genre is criticized for giving us "carpool tunnel", you click, a lot. you do use keys to cast different spells, attacks, and abilities. So for fair warning, you will spend a lot of time in this game clicking.\nThere is a feature in the game that lets you load up your pet with tons of gear, and send 'em back to town to sell them for you, or buy health potions, basically you never need to go to town to sell gear or buy potions, you're servant pet will do it for you. What does this mean for you, brave adventurer? More dungeon crawling, less vendering trash items! Yay!  (Hopefully!)\n\nAchievements: So I hit 76% completion on this game, I've given up trying to actively get 100% completed for achievements, mostly because RNG (Random Number Generator) hates me. I decided getting above 75% was pretty good for a game with 123 achievements, many requiring grinding.\nAchievement categories: Beat the game/boss, try doing this, kill this many enemies, open this many of these, do this ____ amount of times, get lucky, play long enough to do this 100,000,000 times. Again, basically I assume that I'll eventually make more progress on this game as I find people who are like "hey, play this with me!" and I'm like "okay, I only need to 3,000 more potions! let's do it!"\nHalf of these achievements are from just playing the game, so you can enjoy that, but getting 100% will require a lot of play time. Just a warning :)\n\nPrice: Torchlight II costs $19.99, I've spent 70 hours playing it. That's definitely worth it. Most people will at least get over 20 hours in the game, even if they're not trying to beat it.\nAs always, I suggest getting the game on sale or in a humble bundle, but the stand alone price is very much worth it, based on the amount of game time I squeezed out of it.\n\nConclusion: Story: interesting the first time through, it was very dragged out (not in a bad way, really),  Game play: click x1,000,000 (over 9,000 clicks used in the making of this review), Achievements: nothing to write home about, Price: very good price based on the amount of time required to play through the whole game.\nThis type of game is best suited for people who already know they like dungeon crawlers, I've played several, if you're new to the series this is a great game to start trying it out with! Just be warned there is a lot of clicking involved. Again, this game becomes a 100 times more fun with a friend or two. But, I did play through the whole game solo my first time.","November 14, 2014","true","71.3"," 81 of 95 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","81","95","4","2"

The Heart of Ordrak, which he has taken, has imbued him with inconceivable powers & a clear purpose. Will you be able to stop him before his mental blight sets Vilderan aflame?\n\nThe game takes place in Vilderan, a vast continent, sub-divided further into different areas. Vilderan’s areas are diverse & unique to each Act, from lonesome deserts to dense marshes. It invariably exudes an open-world adventure unlike its predecessor.\n\nThere are four distinct classes – Engineer, Outlander, Embermage & Berserker. Each class has three different skill trees, which enable mixing & matching different skills to maximize efficiency and/or enjoyment. All weapon types can be used by any class, further adding to the sheer variability of play styles.\n\nThe character creation screen has a small selection of different aesthetic options. The option to choose between genders is also present. There is a wide variety of pet companions to choose from.\n\nThere are four distinct difficulties – Casual, Normal, Veteran & Elite. They pleasantly suit a wide array of gamers & scale in difficulty at a fairly even pace. Hardcore mode – a defining proponent of the genre – is also present & available at any difficulty. Enable at your own risk, of course.\n\nThe co-op in Torchlight II boasts of a user-friendly system that enables up to six players to play together. Either join a band of adventurers or start your own adventure & wait for others to join in on the fun. From showing your friends your lackluster DPS while a werewolf teaches you a lesson in face-to-paw combat to trading your wares to better your gear, the co-op experience is not to be glossed over.\n\nDid anyone mention modifications? Steam Workshop enables the use of a sheer endless amount of mods to suit almost every whim. Mods may also be used during co-op sessions if users have the same mod(s) installed.\n\nThe graphics and universal interface in Torchlight II are reminiscent of its predecessor but overall feel refined & improved upon. The graphics while marginally cartoony bring the world to life & does the game its due diligence. The musical notes are fairly bland & unmemorable; they don’t go beyond fulfilling their base purpose. Apart from the musical notes, the animation sounds are crisp & noteworthy, bringing Vilderan to life.\n\nIn conclusion, Runic Games’ Torchlight II is the quintessential culmination of the defining proponents of the Action-RPG genre & an improved iteration in the Torchlight saga. Truly, a must-have masterpiece in the collection of any Action-RPG fanatic.\n\n9.5/10","April 4, 2015","true","155.8"," 80 of 95 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","80","95","3","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mitch13pavel/recommended/200710/","mitch13pavel","Mitch13pavel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mitch13pavel/","566 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NBQWKkDKsY\n\nTorchlight 2 takes everything that has come to define the action-RPG genre and delivers it all in an incredibly well polished package. From fast paced brutal hack n’ slash combat to immersive diverse level design to an abundance of loot, Torchlight 2 has it all. Developed by Runic Games; a small Dev team of around 30 members in Seattle WA, they prove that they have what it takes to create a quality product that can compete and even outshine the likes of juggernaut developer Blizzard and their own ARPG Diablo III.\n\nThe game starts the way you would expect an Action-RPG to start, by choosing your characters class. The game offers four different classes to choose from; Outlander: the gun wielding bad ♥♥♥ class, Engineer: the steampunk style, tinkering, gadget using class, Embermage: the typical wizardry spell casting class, and the Berzerker: the warrior heavy hitting class.  Each class feels different enough from one another where your play throughs still feel fresh and entertaining if you decide to give the game another play through as a different character. The combat is fast paced and hectic, the best way to describe the way it feels would be to call it a “controlled chaos”, meaning that while at times things do get crazy as you’re being ambushed by a massive horde of enemies, but you never resort to just spamming mouse clicks to succeed, you have to understand how your characters class works and use that knowledge to stay alive. For example; if you are an Embermage, you aren’t going to be able to rush head on into hordes of enemies and make it out alive like you would as a bulkier Berzerker.\n\nNext to the combat, the games second greatest strength is the level design, with each map being randomly generated you will never experience the same thing twice. This allows the game to continue to feel fresh if you decide to do multiple play throughs. While randomly generated maps aren’t anything new to games, Torchlight 2’s random generation feels like they are gorgeously hand crafted levels, if you weren’t already aware of the R&G then you wouldn’t ever be able to tell by the games gorgeously laid out levels and dungeons.\n\nThe developers also paid a strong attention to detail in the weapons, armor, and items in the game. With such a large diverse number of weapons and various armors to equip you won’t become bored from having to use any one weapon or set of armor for any long period of time as there are loot drops and chests galore located all throughout the expansive dungeons you’ll be crawling your way through. But what good would such a large trove of weapons and armor be without an expansive onslaught of enemies to vanquish? Have no worries, the game has a large array of varying enemies to slaughter, from hulking snow beasts to dark lord necromancers the game does not burn you out on any one style of enemy.\n\nTorchlight 2 is best played with friends, but even if you don’t have anyone to play with Torchlight 2 provides you with a trusty animal companion who will fight alongside you. Not only does your pet companion work like a beefy tank to distract enemies when you have to run off and heal, but they are also your errand running slave, they double as a 2nd backpack that can be packed full of all the valuable loot that you’ve managed to acquire. You can then send your pet off to the market with a shopping list of various health and mana potions and he will sell your loot and return with the potions, this eliminates the need to travel all the way back to town yourself and interrupt your questing. Not necessarily a revolutionary gameplay mechanic but it is incredibly convenient and keeps the game pace going full speed ahead.\n\nTorchlight 2 doesn’t do anything that hasn’t really been done before, it’s not new or innovative, but it does take everything good that has been done before and bundles them all together and manages to deliver them all perfectly. The combat is seamless and the expansive diverse levels and dungeons leave much to explore. The game has so much to offer and I would highly recommend Torchlight 2 to anyone looking for a fun fast paced gameplay experience.\n\n","February 2, 2015","true","8.3"," 66 of 76 people (87%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","87","66","76","8","0"

Torchlight II is all about skill trees, equipment, looting, equipment, defeating hordes of monsters, making your name known to the world, and equipment. Did I mention equipment? Because you'll be finding tons of that. I love that changing equipment actually changes the appearance of your character (I wish there were vanity items because sometimes I went with the prettiest gear, not the ones with the best stats).\n\nPlaying with a friend is, naturally, a lot more fun than on your own though, to be honest, all you need is the pet you choose at the very beginning because SPOILER: it will never die. There are a handful of such pets to choose from and the pet system is one of my favourites out of any I've experienced because, not only do they act as a completely necessary additional inventory (did I mention you'd find a lot of equipment?) but because you can send them off to sell the goodies you no longer need. Mind blown. If you're getting this game, that should be reason enough.\n\nThere are also classes with their own customizable skill trees--both of which keep growing in diversity due to mods from other players. There's something for everyone: if you're into blasting everything to pieces with a cannon, do that. Fan of fire? There's a class for you, too. The world is constantly growing for new and old players alike.\n\nTorchlight II is a hack and slash adventure that will have you traipsing through zombie infested bogs, crossing the desert and going to the underworld itself in order to save your world from the evil Alchemist. I invested a solid 20 hours during my first playthrough and I'm ready for a second round with a whole new class.\n\nBuy it.","December 28, 2013","true","26.7"," 54 of 65 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","54","65","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doc_rock2/recommended/200710/","doc_rock2","Doc Rock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doc_rock2/","485 products in account","Torchlight 2 Review\nOne only has to look at the numbers to see that Runic Games really struck gold when they released the hit sequel Torchlight 2 as a follow-up to their original action RPG game, Torchlight. While it may not give anything new to the genre and it didn't win a bunch of awards like its predecessor, it still sold over 2 million copies in less than a year of its full release date. Impressive. The reason is quite simple: everything Torchlight 2 does, it does well.\n\nAll of our favorite features from Torchlight return and have been improved, such as pets and fishing, in addition to some new features being added. Some of the changes you can expect to see include: an expanded crafting system, a longer campaign that spans across various maps, the user interface has been improved and made simpler, mods are openly welcomed, a Multiplayer co-op mode has been added, and now players have two choices to continue gameplay even after finishing the campaign with New Game Plus and Mapworks. The graphics and sound are really nice and the special effects are superb. With Torchlight 2's random map generator for dungeons, replay value is even greater. Loaded with action and filled with loot, this game is sure to entertain.\n\nProbably the best thing about Torchlight 2 is the seemingly endless customization possibilities. Players can choose their character from four different classes, each with their own unique abilities and specialized equipment. There are countless armor and weapon variations throughout the game, most of which add additional bonuses or power-ups to your character. Then of course, sockets can be added to the equipment which will allow you to insert gems into them, giving even more bonuses and special abilities. And don't forget that while journeying through the expansive dungeons scattered across the maps, players will come across furry little critters that offer an assortment of enchantments that can be added to each item for a fee. With the right combinations you can turn your character into a demigod and that's before you ever begin experimenting with the almost limitless crafting system where players can create stronger potions, better gems, more unique items and armor, etc.\n\nOf course, no game is perfect and players have their own tastes and preferences. So while the game is a lot of fun and highly recommended, there are a few things players should know when deciding on whether to buy this game or not. There is no controller support included with Torchlight 2. Players who prefer controllers over mouse will need to add in their own mapping or download one. The good news is there are several already out there and can easily be added, so its not a really big hassle. Don't expect a deep storyline in this game. While there is a story that plays out across the campaign trail, its not fleshed out very well and is less than enthralling. While it is lacking, this shouldn't be an issue for the most part because the game keeps the action moving at a steady pace so most players probably won't even give it a second thought anyways.\n\nAlso, expect a few random bugs. Fortunately none of them are game-breaking and not of big consequence but they do exist. From fishing holes not being accessible to loot being hurled out of the player's reach or even characters occasionally being pushed onto a ledge by a charging mob with no way to escape (other than using a port scroll), know that on occasion something like this may happen. Players aren't really going to miss much of anything as a result and aside from these minor nuissances the game runs very smooth and never crashes.\n\nThe Good:\n=======+  Good graphics with top-notch special effects\n+  Solid sound effects and above average voiceovers\n+  Full-length story campaign\n+  Limitless character & item customization options\n+  Variety of special abilities\n+  Well-developed crafting system\n+  Simple controls\n+  UI is comfortable and easy to use\n+  Multiplayer co-op\n+  Mod-friendly game environment\n+  Low resource requirements allow gameplay on most machines\n+  Steam Achievements & Trading Cards\n+  High replay value\n+  Price (similar games often cost twice as much)\n+  A ton of loot and treasure\n\nThe Bad:\n======-  No controller support included\n-  Random bugs (not game-breaking)\n-  No auto-collect for treasure after battle\n-  Story is not very intriguing\n-  A ton of loot and treasure\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n===========While Torchlight 2 isn't ground-breaking and its not going to blow your socks off, the game is still very entertaining and offers numerous hours of gameplay. There's a reason why its one of the most popular and liked games on Steam and can be found in most game libraries. This game has a lot of features included and all of them are packaged extremely well. If you don't already own it, I definitely recommend picking up a copy.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","May 12, 2015","true","97.5"," 57 of 74 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","57","74","2","10"

If Torchlight 1 felt a lot like Diablo 1 to you (in its ARPG gameplay department + with the constant direction of going further down the dungeons w/ each level), then Torchlight II should then feel like Diablo II. Torchlight II improves so much over the original TL, I don't even know where to begin - just like how Diablo II improved immensely over the original Diablo. Granted, TL2 has its own spin on the ARPG genre, in some ways: you have a pet by your side (who you can send back to town to sell items; who can help you in battle; etc); the graphics are much brighter + more colorful than Diablo series; and it has a steampunk-inspired setting.\n\nNo longer are you confined to go down, down, and down the dungeons some more like Diablo. The game is now a bit more open and epic than that. TL2 sports multiple towns - just like Diablo II. Also, the side-quests here - they also can be found when you're out an about in the game-world, which likely will have their own areas and dungeons for you to crawl through.\n\nCombat is as awesome and as action-packed as ever, with the game constantly chucking out tons of new and unique loot to the player to modify and upgrade; and there's tons of skills to learn. Leveling-up allows the player to sink points into the player's base-stats for numbers how they see fit, unlike some other major ARPG (Diablo III) - allowing the player's builds even within the same class to possibly be different from another player's build.\n\nWhile the story + characters are nothing truly special here - like in many of these ARPG's - it's still certainly better than the previous game. The graphics are nothing truly remarkable in terms of technical quality, but the art direction is fantastic, quirky, and colorful. TL2 sports SIngle Player support (for online play or offline play); Online support for Co-Op via Runic's servers; and also LAN support - unlike another ARPG that has currently forced "online always" gameplay (Diablo III). If a gamer is looking for numerous different ways to play this game - it's certainly here.\n\nOnce finished with the Campaign, fans can come back and explore some other Randomized Dungeons and even enter New Game Plus Mode. Given that, and that this game offers a lot of value for those not just who do one playthrough (took me around 27 hours, all by myself - SIngle Player style) - but also to those who want to replay the game. When it debuted at its budget-price ($20), it offers plenty of value and "bang for the buck" when compared to its competitors that were charging $50-60. Even now, when it's on sale dirt-cheap - it's pretty much a steal. And this all, this isn't even counting that the game also does have Mods out there, which further can extend the life of the game - since this game comes with The Game's Editor (GUTS) and also supports The Steam Workshop.\n\nIf you love ARPG's, this one's pretty much a no-brainer: Torchlight II is an excellent ARPG that just cannot be recommended enough. Simply put: it's one of the best of these loot-crazy, action-packed ARPG's around.\n\nFinal Grade = A.","April 9, 2014","true","27.2"," 40 of 48 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","40","48","0","0"

Diablo II was one of my all-time favorite and most played games.  Torchlight was good, scratched the itch, but didn't really 'hold' me.  I had a lot of hope for Torchlight II, but like TL1, it just sort of felt.. empty.\n\nWhat works: The atmosphere is pretty good, I like how the monsters 'exist' before you wake them up in various sets of realistic repose.  Very nice touch.  The game is colorful and generally graphically engaging, although I don't really like any of the character designs.  It /is/ a Diablo clone, so it has that addictive loot-gathering gameplay, but I can't really evaluate it, because I didn't stick with it long enough for that to become relevant.\n\nWhat doesn't work:\nThe skill trees feel bland, with a limited number of 'correct' choices.  The class-specific charge bars are terrible - either really boring (wizard and archer) or uninteractively 'see-sawing' power spikes (berserker).  The engineer is the only one that feels like it 'works'.\nMelee still feels kind of like a bad choice, with the amount of damage enemies deal at closer range.  As a ranged fighter, much of the combat takes place off-screen, which is terrible game design (albeit, extremely common in the genre).\nHaving some skills be dropped or bought (for example, most of the summon spells) makes building characters even /more/ dependent on drop luck than is the norm.  It also breaks down some class variety.\n\nMost significantly, the game just felt off, for reasons I struggle to describe.  I never felt fully engaged.  I put a fair amount of effort in, pushing multiple characters through act 1, but every time, I found myself fighting boredom by the halfway point, and had totally lost interest by the time I stumbled blearily into the desert.  (Act II is a desert?

This should also emphasize how much I've played this game and my experience playing it.)\n\n(This is my first actual review, I thought I would give this masterpiece the honors.)\n\nIntro: To start I would like to say that I will have bias towards the game even if I try to be as objective as possible. Given my playtime and connection to this game, this should be a given.\nI found out about this game from a friend of mine who told me they loved the first game but never played the second, I found out about it and decided I would buy it on sale for I think around 10 dollars around the time (forgive me if this is wrong my memory may be wrong). My past arpg's had been only Diablo 1 & 3 and Sacred 2 at the time so I was excited to hop into another being a newfound fan of the genre.\n\nIt all started when I clicked that "New Game" button. Clicked the berserker and typed "Shaddah".\n\nNow to the actual review!\nI'll make each of these sections quick for your reading pleasure.\n\nGameplay: (Almost Perfect)\nEverything in this game plays extremely smoothy, response times are instant and combat is quick, flashy, and most importantly fluid.\n\nExcept for the occasional bugs like when i try to shift-click or right-click an item to transfer or equip and the ocacsional hiccup everything else is like it says up there in the parenthesis, almost perfect.\n\nRandomization is extensive in this game, loot enemies, levels, basically almost everything in this game is randomly generated, except for things like your chosen character and pet.\n\nRecommened Mods for ridiculous amounts of content:\nAdventure Pack II (and levelscale:HIGHLY RECOMMENDED WITH LEVEL500 MOD)\nSynergiesMOD\nHaknslash Essentials\nclasspack\nand level500mod (KEEP IN MIND THIS WILL BREAK AND/OR RENDER SOME GAME MECHANICS USELESS Examples:Making Builds, Some Synergies Content)\n\nGraphics: (Perfect)\n\nThey are cartoony, doesn't go for realism and fulfills it's purpose.\n\nGraphics mods I would recommend\nInk'd & Ink'd for Synergies\nThe Half-Life 2 ENB Enchancer (ran through Torchlight II Directory)\n\nSound: (Perfect, phenominal with mods)\nMusic fits it's purpose with general orchestral pieces (my favorite being the menu theme) and nice songs that fit the mood, theme and atmosphere of every location.\n\nPhenominal music mods:\nDiablo II music mod\nFinal Fantasy music mod (includes track from Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross)\n\nOverall: (Amazing game)\n\nOverall this game is a phenomincal package for it's extremely low price and even better it you happen to catch it on sale, the community is friendly and the modding scene from what I've seen, seems to be strong and thriving (mainly being represented with Synergies). The game is, in my opinion, the BEST arpg out there hands down and offers the MOST content out of any arpg I've seen here on steam or played in my entire history with the genre.\n\nSadly there comes a time where I must mention the cons, because even with my deep love for this game I must point out the quirks and cons.\n\nQuirks and Cons: (ehh?)\nNo OpenGL support? - whenever I've tried this by enabling it through .config the game crashes on start.\nShift-tab and Right-click sometimes don't work.\nWith a freely moving camera the detail on the levels is only viewable from the fixed and defualt isometric perspective.\nSome achievements require online play (just a really tiny quirk for me)\nMapworks accesibility and variety is, at times lacking, I found it more worth my time to beat the game again, given the more intresting randomly generated enviroments.\n\nAll in all the game is phenominal, the DEFINITIVE arpg, If you love arpgs or are intrested in the genre, or even just want a relaxing game to kill time in, this is a MUST BUY!\n\nTo end this I would like to thank all the developers and modders that made my experience possible, Runic Games, Salan and all the other mod authors and players out there! Seeya and happy looting!\n\n\nDo I recommend this game, yes... hell yes!","February 24","true","867.5"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","23","23","2","1"

It takes everything the first game did wrong (Or not quite good), starting for the lack of Multiplayer, and fixes it, improves it, and makes it right. For torchlight 2 the developers did really listen to the communitty and did their homework: Gameplay, mechanics, upgrades... everything is fixed, polished and balanced. The multiplayer, although with some connection problems here and there, tends to work great and is really well implemented into the game (both loot wise, as each player gets its own loot so no more fighting over the coins and mod wise, as you can easily connect with other players who has the same mods) and, as expected, not only really fun to play, but the main reason to get the game.\n\nBut, this is it. It's a polished but already known formula. If you are a veteran in this kind of games, you will feel at home in the world of Torchlight 2, but maybe you will feel it is "too home": There's nothing you have already seen in other diablo like game, nothing original in its approach, even each of the acts style is similar to the Diablo 2 acts (desert-jungle-hell/volcano anyone?): It's a genuine jewel, but a jewel we all have seen in a lot of places before.\n\nA huge extra point is the communitty behind this game. Mods like synergies have added TONS of new places to kill monsters, TONS of new monsters to be killed, TONS of new weapons to kill with and TONS of armor to avoid getting killed. Although the vanilla game is short in its main campaing (remember: the fun is in the second time you finish the game), with the mod support the Torchlight world expands beyond any other Diablo like game.\n\nTorchlight 2 is a great game many of us have already played. If you are looking for the next step in the Diablo formula, you are not looking in the right place (maybe the workshop has some hints already), but if you are looking for a step in an already stablished place, a consistent, fun and balanced Diablo clone, Torchlight is the best option you have right now.","January 12, 2014","true","155.3"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","28","33","0","0"

When I first saw this game on steam a long time ago I said to myself. "It seems to be a crappy eagle vision version of Dota 2" No offense to any Dota 2 fans...   I ended ignoring Torchlight 2's existence for about a year.\n\nAbout a week ago I saw this game on sale and I bought it well because it was on sale xD\nMan, I feel so STUPID as to dislike this game on its appearance.\n\nPros:\n\n- Amazing loot selection. Your not just selling every single item that doesn't appeal to you.\n- Freedom of weapon customizations. Maybe you want to have your Berserker use dual pistols or whatever you feel like using.\n- Interesting bosses. Your not just fighting a giant blob...\n- Most of the time, you use your mouse to move and attack so you rarely need to use your keyboard, which is great for those who want to multitask...no not in that way...\n-Beautiful settings. (Realistic forests, dungeons, etc).\n- The game runs very well with all settings turned the highest. Unless you have a windows 98 or something which can't run this game xD (OBVIOUSLY)\n- Max level is 100 so you can show off and get a bunch of characters to lv 100 if you wish.\n\nCons:\n\n- Sometimes the quest marker really pisses me off. Sometimes the quest marker will direct me to a dungeon that I have already explored. I end up going inside, the quest marker tells me to go back out. WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥?!?!? Though this rarely happens, but when it does, it is on a side quest mission. This was for me though, I have no idea if the game will be like that for you guys.\n\n\nOverall I rate this game 9/10\n\nSUGOI!!\n\n\n\n\n","October 10, 2014","true","51.0"," 62 of 91 people (68%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","68","62","91","8","4"

I've always rejected it as a cheap diablo clone.\nI picked it up because it was on sale for like nothing. I had it over a year and never played it. But once Diablo 3 turned out to be a huge disappointment, I gave this game a try. And oh boy is it awesome.\n\nIt surpassed my expectation by far! I couldn't stop playing it.\nIt does almost everything better than Diablo 3.\n\nThe game just plays and feels great.\nI really love the free skilltree and character development, you can do whatever you want.\nYou can choose every difficulty right from the start.\nThe Elite difficulty offers a great challenge, right  from level 1 and it wont get easy until very very late into the game.\nThe game world itself is huge and feels alive.\nThe towns are full of merchants, gambler, enchanters and other NPCS.\nThe over world and dungeons are filled with hordes of monsters and many bosses that offer a great challenge.\nThe Mapworks offer a unlimited amount of random generated dungeons. Which is just awesome.\n\nAnd the best thing. The loot system. Every player gets his OWN loot. There are hundreds of items with 5 quality tiers\nAnd set items.\n\nEnough with the good stuff, the game lacks story. If you don't watch out you miss the story. And the story is also pretty short you can get through the game in 20h or even less. But it has a New Game+ feature so its no that bad.\n\nThe multiplayer loading time can  get really really REALLY long. I don't know why but sometimes it takes like 5~10 minutes! to move from  map A to B.\nThe game saves on your local hard drive so you run  into a lot of cheater when playing multiplayer.\nOnly 4 character classes. That's always a letdown for me but...\n\nThanks to the Steam Workshop and the great community we have access to so many mods that we are able to change every part of the game to our own liking. Every point I've listed can be changed. I've ended up with over 30 character classes and thousands of new items, new dungeons, bosses...everything Is possible. Most mods do work in multiplayer. New mods are coming out almost everyday and you even get the developer kit to create your own mods.\n\nAt this point, i want to point out one specific mod, Synergies.\nSynergies is the best Mod  for TL2. Its an overhaul mod that changes almsot everything.\nSalan, the mods creator put alot of work into this awesome mod.\nMake sure to visit us at: http://forums.synergiesmod.com/index.php\n\nI recommend this game to everyone that like RPG, mod and co-op/multiplayer games.\n\nEnd.","March 17, 2014","true","305.5"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","23","29","0","1"

Well, every single top-down dungeon crawler, can be called a "clone" of diablo so be quiet haters. However if you are debating over getting diablo 3 or this game, this game is the way to go, because 1:it's cheaper. 2:Diablo 3 is not even that good without reaper of souls. Thus this game is a better deal for cash reasons, and the mods are amazing for it, so if you still prefer diablo over this game you could at least mod this game so much that you can at least make it enjoyable. If you wanted to get diablo 2 over this game, then yes get it, it's like 6 bucks on amazon and like $4 shipping that's why it is like $6. Now that I have that cleared up I will actually talk about this game. This game is made by the people who made Fate, my first dungeon crawler I ever played, and that game is quite good as well. I suggest it, but not over this game. This game is so enjoyable, especially with the synergies mod, if you like vanilla of this game then you will love the synergies mod it makes the game easilly twice as better. Now this game follows the classic dungeon crawler basics get loot, and kill stuff, but also instead of just leveling up a few skills that the game already has for you to level up, instead it has skilltrees so it has major replayablity and also it has many different weapons for you to use and there is 4 classes with 3 skill trees on each so that could easily be 12+ playthroughs. But i can tell you with my mods i have i have like another 6 classes easily all well made. Another thing that is great about this game, is that the pet mechanic works brilliantly, inventory full, I think not send your crap you don't want and put it in your pets inventory, pets inventory full? Send it to town to sell that crap you don't want, so you can stay killing stuff and looting stuff. I highly recommend this game one of my favourites of all time. 9.5/10 this game is waaaaay to underrated it must be more popular. Also I have an idea if this game evr gets a torchlight 3, if they can try this, maybe make it like a dungeon crawler but heres the catch mix those mechanics and make it like an open world sandbox, such as skyrim or fallout. That is all, once again 9.5/10 I hop this game gets a triquel.","October 25, 2014","true","143.7"," 39 of 60 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","39","60","0","5"

Not only are there plenty more weapons, accessories, and armor combinations to choose from, but a more immersive environment with a decent story behind it. The cutscenes are very simple, yet still makes you want to play on for another few hours. It's also considerably longer than the first one.\n\nOne thing I have enjoyed the most would have to be the large amount of skills provided in the game, and the ability to upgrade them to different tiers, making them even more powerful. That is certainly one of the best parts of the game to me. I'm constantly working to level up so I can get a new skill or get to the next tier because it sounds so awesome to be able to "slash your way through your foes, leaving them stunned in your wake" or to "stomp the ground causing ice shards to come out in four different directions, producing massive damage". That's not word for word from the game, but you get my point.\n\nAnother thing I really love is the fact that during multiplayer, everyone gets their own loot so you aren't fighting for who gets what items and gold. That, to me, improves multiplayer 100%. Even still, while playing with friends, the difficulty increases so it's not a walk in the park. I like a bit of a challenge, so it's fun when you and someone else have some sort of epic boss fight and get your own epic loot from it.\n\nI highly recommend you try this if you have played the first Torchlight. Even if you haven't, it's not like the entire story will be confusing, almost forcing you to play the first one.\n\nIt's that good.","January 21, 2014","true","48.5"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

You can play as one of the four classes that have their own unique skill-tree and play-style. They are:\n> Outlanders, who are good at long range weapons and poison-based magic. Skill Trees: Warfare, Lore, Sigil.\n> Berserkers, who are goot at close range weapons, quick attack and animal-based special powers. Skill Trees: Hunter, Tundra, Shadow\n> Embermage, who are goot at high level elemental magic attacks. Skill Trees: Inferno, Frost, Storm\n> Engineer, who are good at heavy melee wapons and steam-puck technologies such as robots and stuff. Skill Trees: Blitz, Construction, Aegis.\n\nPros:\n+ Good story.\n+ Great gameplay.\n+ Great pseudo-randomly generated world. Each map is generated so that you will feel certain differences in each of your visits.\n+ Great loots. There are so many great Items that you wont be able to carry and save with your very limited Inventory slot.\n+ Good and gorgeous graphics\n+ Great arrays of side missions, which will keep you busy for hours and hours and gameplay and loots.\n\nCons:\n- Inventory slots are too limited, wont hurt to add more :D\n\nOverall: 90/100\n","October 14, 2015","true","58.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","12","13","3","0"

It's a fast-paced game with a good loot drop variety and frequency. Its co-op supports a party with up to 8 members (with an official mod). By the way, it's also very moddable and it has a lot of cool options that range from slightly modify the game to complete rebalance. The classes are all different from the original and there's a lot of different ways to build everyone. It can have some problems when it comes to syncing with other players but that seems to have improved a lot in the last months.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071749678/recommended/200710/","76561198071749678","Renner","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071749678/","138 products in account","Forged by the former Blizzard developers who brought you Diablo games (none of the former Blizzard North employees worked on Diablo 3, btw) it's hard to not compare the two, especially when you hear that nice and atmospheric soundtrack from Matt Uelmen (who, of course, wrote the soundtracks for the first 2 Diablo games) which will certainly bring back some memories of Sanctuary. Since they are just an indie dev studio now, without WoW-milking Blizzard budget, there's no more shiny things like super-duper CGI cutscenes, but that doesn't take away from its charm.\n\nBesides those mentioned reasons there are some others with Diablo vibe. Former hero who got corrupted, and now poses a threat to the world, while he is traveling across the wooden-snowy/dusty desert/jungly regions (sounds familiar, doesn't it?) in an attempt to free an ancient evil. Of course, you are always behind him, while you are trying to fix things which he messed up, until the final showdown at the end.\n\nEach region has a town which serves as your safe heaven/hub area. There you can trade, use enchanters to boost your equipment, certain specialist who can recover your gems by destroying the equpment or vice versa - destroying gems and freeing the slot to insert better gems to give better stats to your equpment. And there you will get majority of your story related quests. In the town, and in the areas around it, there are folks who can give you bunch of optional quests. You can ignore them completely if you want, but without the experience from their quests it will just be harder for you the further you travel into the game.\n\nYou can chose between four classes: Embermage, Engineer, Outlander, and Berserker. Personally, I've found Engineer to be the most versatile, as through investements in his skill tree you can turn it easily into close combat fighting machine or into ranged fighter. Sure, you can do with other classes whatever you want, but Berserker is obviously close combat class, which you can't say for Outlander.\n\nYou can also chose a pet, including iconic Half-Life headcrab. Your pet is your shadow, it fights beside you, and also serves as a secondary inventory. You can send it into town to sell whatever you don't need, and also to get the potions/scrolls from your shop list, and in this way you don't have to bother using town portal scrolls or to travel back to do it yourself. Pet can be fed with various kinds of fishes (yes, you can also fish in this game), temporary transforming it into different kind of a beast. And, just as yourself, it can learn spells, making it even more usefull in combat.\n\nThere's multiplayer co-op, which requires creating 3rd party Runic account.  Group can contain up to 6 players, although I've never played in a group this large, but more players will certainly help in the hardest modes, especially when you create an hardcore character who's death is permanent (at least pet's death isn't permanent, even in this mode). Speaking of which, you can also share your equipement between your own characters over shared stash in towns, but you can't share between hardcore - non-hardcore characters. As gold and loot flies everywhere just grab anything without any pardon, since every player sees his own loot. Then you can trade with each other, which is usefull for getting rid of certain class exclusive pieces which your current class may not use (unless you are planning to share it with yourself for another character of yours, over previously mentioned shared stash option).\n\nOnce you complete the game, you can start the New Game + mode, and continue developing your character. By finishing the game you are also unlocking Mapworks area (also available in NG+), where you can buy dungeon maps with various buffs or nerfs for either yourself or your enemies, and spend the time killing and looting in them to your liking.\n\nIf I have to nitpick about something... Those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 4 broken achievements! UARGH, this achievement-hunting junky rash in my hand... Its really lame when you've spent so much time completing everything, including some annoying grindy achivements, and devs are still saying it will be dealth with, even after an year since they originally promissed it will be solved... As you can see, the support of this game is dead, as they are just a small studio which moved all of its manpower to the next big thing. But there's Steam Workshop support, and no lack of quality mods for this game. EDIT: After several years of whining at Runic Steam forums those broken achieves have been finally removed. It was totally worth it...\n\nBut if you don't care for such things, the game itself is worth the cost (even with some free quality titles such as Path of Exile, but T2 doesn't have microtransactions like PoE has), especially on the sale, as you can easily squizee at least 20-30 hours of fun from it. Friend of mine who said he got sick of the game has over 20 hours.","April 30, 2014","true","76.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GetOutNowDontStayLeave/recommended/200710/","GetOutNowDontStayLeave","Jack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GetOutNowDontStayLeave/","608 products in account","Alright, it's about time I give this absolutely amazing game the review it deserves. This game is honestly one of the best, my personal favourite, RPG games ever made. This game has everything that makes it entertaining and enjoyable to play. Just to put this out there, I've put in only over 30+ hours and I still haven't beat the story; so I won't be commenting on that just yet, I will hopefully edit it once I've completed it and give my final thoughts + opinions on it. So, to start off, I'll talk about the art of the game.\n\nThis game is simply beautiful. Like, really. The locations that you visit are honestly some of the most astounding places I've been able to visit in a video game; and that's just the best feeling I've experienced within a game. The places fit their names perfectly, if the name is something drab and gloomy, the level makes sure to match the atmosphere it's trying to portray. If the name however is something cheery and pleasent, you can certainly expect an amazing looking level with many, many bright colours and just making it a downright beautiful level.\n\nThe art for enemies is honestly so well done and it makes the game feel that bit more creepy and dark. The enemies all seem like they could fit into any serious and dark horror film. Enemies in this game are made perfectly from an art standpoint, like seriously. I know it sounds like I'm repeating myself but this game would give me nightmares if the enemies used were in a horror movie. They're just like nightmares except personified. The dark enemies can lead to some of the game feeling like an absolute hell, and the bosses are just.. Well, just as great as the normal enemies to be frank.\n\nSpeaking of bosses, the art on them is absolutely top-notch and cannot be topped. I wish I could talk about the bosses without spoiling anything, but that just won't be possible, so I'm afraid I'll cut that there. Just know that the boss art is actually amazing and once again, using this horror movie bit, could make anything horrifying and downright terrifying. I think that to truly see what the bosses are like in this game, you should 100% get the game just to see the art of the bosses and enemies alone.\n\nNow, to talk about something that I adore in this game and something that makes this game seem like it's had years upon years of work put into it; the sheer amount of items in this game. Like, seriously. This game has weapons for everyone. Want a giant hammer to smash your foes? This game's got it! Prefer to use guns to shoot your enemies and inflict massive damage? Check! Want a massive amount of weapons which aren't limited to a certain class and can be used by any class? Well, this game has it! Yes, that's right, there are no class limitations on weapons (mostly!).\n\nThe weapons in this game are so unique and there's almost no weapon like another. What I mean is, all weapons are somewhat unique compared to any other weapon in this game. The different types of which loot you can get (I mean like common, elemental, rare, etc!) are all a unique way of making sure that every weapon is so different and has it's own stats. Like, maybe it adds some extra fire damage or even some ice damage. Hell, throw some poison onto that bad boy and make it a real powerhouse of damage!\n\nSpeaking of damage, don't expect all weapons that you get to be super-mega-hyper-ultra OP. Most weapons are actually pretty darn bad from a damage perspective;  but make up for it with an amazing damage OUTPUT. What I mean by that is, the damage may be bad but with the amount of leveling up you can do and the amount of skill points which can be contributed to each skill, you do end up doing more damage than the weapon claims. Say the weapon says that it does 60 damage, you may end up doing somewhere between 200-300 dependant on your skill points and enchantments.\n\nSomething else this game does is enchantments. Each piece of equipment that you get can be enchanted by a special person in each town. This Racoon-type person will enchant all weapons or armour for a price. The enchantments can be great - or not so great - just because, well, it's an RPG so you can't expect a walk in the park! The enchantments are fairly basic but at the same time can really help you in a major way. From adding fire or electric armour to adding health stolen on hit!\n\nSo, enough about the art and more about the actual enemies and bosses themselves. Each enemy in this game is unique and unlike the other, mostly. Some of the bosses are downright so enjoyable that I can't wait to fight them again when I start a Newgame+. The game does an excellent job of making you feel like the bosses are tough but beatable, and getting late-game you really start to experience that feeling. Some of the bosses may seem like they're easy at first glance, but damn do they get hard. Don't go to any boss expecting it to be an easy ride.\n\nThe game allows you to experience it at your own pace, be you a slow player who wants to take it all in and explore all the areas that the game has to offer to you or maybe you want to ignore all the enemies and speedrun the game as fast as you want. The game allows you to play at YOUR pace. Once again, this is good for letting everyone have their own option in how they want to play. You want a game which doesn't hold your hand but somewhat lets you play fast? This game is PERFECT.\n\nIn conclusion, because I can feel myself droning on and on, this game is honestly turning into one of my favourite games of all time - yes, all time! - This game has so much to offer me as a player and lets me want to play over and over and over. This game is down-right amazing and I cannot wait to keep playing and playing. Thanks for reading, and for sure get this game if you see it on sale - even if it DOESN'T look like your type of game.","February 20","true","56.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cgesquireIV/recommended/200710/","cgesquireIV","[R] Critrocket Grenadespam Esq.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cgesquireIV/","74 products in account","I really can't sing the praises of Torchlight 2 enough.  A lot of people I know describe it as "Diablo 2.5" and to be fair, it kinda is.  I maintain, however, that it's not a bad thing.  Graphically, it's as pretty as anything I've seen Diablo 3 produce.  Its interface will be instantly familiar to you if you've played Diablo 2, unlike D3 which looks like I'd have to learn all over again.  It has a quest system overworld-and-dungeons combo you'll be familiar with from D2, a potion and scroll system reminiscent of D2's, an item transmutation system that's a very simplified variation of D2's, even tiny atmospheric critters you can squish underfoot, just like in D2.\n\nThat's pretty much where the similarities end.  For one, your inventory is far more convenient.  Gone are the days where you have to juggle space for every item - now everything takes up a single inventory block, and furthermore, consumable items and spells (more on those later) have their own inventory tabs.  Gone are the skill trees, where you have to take this skill in order to take that skill.  Now if you meet the level requirements, you can level the skill.  You can even freely mix skills between various trees without feeling like you're penalizing yourself.  Gone is the irritating stamina system - you can move at full speed, full time, instead of being forced to walk unless you guzzle potions.  Gone are the complicated extra rarities of stuff - there's normal, there's enchanted, there's rare (which includes some sets), unique (also with some sets), and at the highest end, legendary.  Everything drops, eventually.  No need to jump through complicated hoops of requirements to get a particular item - if you're at the right level range for it to drop or appear in the Gambler Shop's inventory, you can get it, if you have the patience and gold.\n\nNew to the genre are permanent pets.  They're more than just there to look cute.  For one, they have their own inventories, which are as robust as yours.  Load 'em up with everything you don't want to carry, like all those trash items you'd never bother with otherwise.  Then, send them off to town to sell your loot.  No need to stop adventuring or use a town portal scroll just to clean out the garbage!  Your pet can even go purchase supplies for you while you're in the field.  Just a brief one or two minute wait is all it takes to get whatever basic amenities you need to keep adventuring.  More than just pack mules, all pets can fight, possessing a basic attack.  However, you can also teach them skills, too.  Ever wanted an alpaca that could spit fire and ice?  How about a bulldog that shoots swarms of bees when it barks?  Or maybe a necropanther - a panther necromancer, summoning skeletal archers and exploding zombies?  Find the right spell scrolls, and your pet can do just that!\n\nSpeaking of spells, these little gems are throwbacks to the days of Diablo 1, where all the magic you own was found in the dungeon and learned the hard way.  Spells exist in addition to your class's skills, and you can have a maximum of four spells.  They're not unique to any class - any class can learn any spell, with the only restriction is having the required level or better.  They range from passive effects to buffs to direct damage spells.  Your barbarian, in addition to his horrific melee combat ability, can supplement his murderous rampage with fireballs, or buff up his attack and movement speed to get him into the fray faster.  It all depends on what spells you find and learn.\n\nFinally, Torchlight II does away with the slowness and stodginess of Diablo 2's gameplay.  Characters are fast and dynamic, enemies are slightly fewer but more brutal, with many, many more enemies having special attacks and abilities, not just champions.  You need to think on your feet a lot more, and use your skills intelligently and in good combination to dominate your foes.  There's less a focus on the stats you fight with and more on how you fight, and there's always numerous ways you can approach a situation with every class.  As an engineer, do you charge in with melee attacks and rely on your armor and defensive buffs to survive?  Or do you hang back with a cannon and blast crowds of enemies while your various killer robots do the grunt work?  It's up to you, and both approaches are completely viable.  In addition, enemies and the world feel more 'alive' - they don't just approach you in random themed hordes, but instead appear dynamically from the environment.  Ezrohir ambushers will burst from the sands of the desert underfoot.  Sturmbeorn raiders will leap from the cliffs overhead to challenge you.  You'll encounter zombies and ghouls devouring a corpse, and when you kill them, the flesh-stripped corpse rises as a skeleton to fight you as well.  Vile mystics will be found performing rituals upon desecrated tombs or will be trying to sacrifice innocent captives, and you can draw the attention of a lich by disturbing its grave.  You can rescue slaves from packs of slaver-bandits, and be surprised when you fight a horrid monster, only for its even-more-horrid mate to show up and join the fight!\n\nAll in all, I consider Torchlight 2 to be a worthy entry to the action-RPG dungeon-crawler subgenre.  It strips the BS out of Diablo 2, keeps what Diablo 2 did well, and then improves upon the whole formula without being as wildly experimental as Diablo 3 is.  And hey, if you don't like what Torchlight II does, vanilla?  Well, it's mod-friendly, and has Steam Workshop support.  If you don't like it, change it!","January 17, 2014","true","129.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/recommended/200710/","mrluchador","Chris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/","1587 products in account","If you enjoyed Torchlight, you'll find more of the same in Torchlight II - and 'More' is pretty much the theme.\n\nWhereas Torchlight was a very concise game with one central hub and a very deep mine to explore, Torchlight II has expanded with several 'base hubs', themed areas and a whole host of new enemies to turn into gibblets. Personally, I found this to have it's positives and negatives.\nThere were times that I missed the simplicity of Torchlight, of just digging down deeper to find tougher and tougher enemies the deeper I delved into the mine. I missed how all your essential services were kept together at the mining camp, and it was easy to navigate. There were times in TL2 where I had to bounce between several hubs to get back to the original base camp where the shared stash and personal stash was based to retrieve gems and items I had stored for later. While this isn't anything major, it did add up to what I felt was a lot of down time between turning monsters into blood stains.\n\nHowever, the expanded features of Torchlight 2 do add several themed areas which are you able to explore to a point (and in some cases contain hidden quests & secret rooms), and probably more important to some - hosted coop. Coop mode is fairly stable and somewhat easy to setup and join when it comes to finding a game. The game provides an in-game text box to allow for people to communicate.\n\nThe main addition that I find as a huge bonus is the integration of the Steam Workshop, which has enabled several add-on mods and 'fixes' to things you might not like (such as mods which bring back classes that were removed from the original game).\n\nIn short Torchlight II is worth playing, as it does enough to be different from the first Torchlight (like it or not), and it's one of the more polished dungeon crawler/loot games out there. Have a good look through Steam Workshop to see if there are any additions you'd like to add to the playthrough, and you should be able to create an experience you'll enjoy.","May 11, 2015","true","199.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","1"

This is a great top-down action RPG game, even coming from me, someone who really doesn't like top-down games. Action is fun and smooth, skill trees lack a little but each class is quite different, coop with friends is crazy fun.\n\nOne of the biggest things for me about these top-down games is I hate the click fest it is because you have to click to move, so you are just constantly clicking just to walk across the room. Well in TL2 you can map a key to be a movement key (I used W) then use the pointer to direct the character. +1 for that. Best control feature.\n\nThere are some great mods out there as well, it has a very rich mod-base to choose from to tweak the game to your liking. Minorly or majorly. I use stuff like minimalist item labels so I can actually see when there are lot of items, respec and reskill potions added so I don't have to worry about the “perfect character build” right from the beginning and can just re-skill my characters if I get a new skill or want to try a different style, and the LurkerHud which gives tons of stats and info right on the dash and I recommend it very heavily.

You've been sitting up that tree for a long time, waiting with your many brothers and sisters for someone to wander past. Suddenly, a stranger approaches! You leap down, snarl, prance about, and are almost immediately annihilated by five blind-fired bolts of magic that leap from my outstretched hands.\n\nLet's assume that, in those final moments, time slows to a tiny fraction of its regular speed. This is what you see: half a dozen of your siblings, stumbling into a purple patch of energy that slows them to a crawl. Six columns of flame bursting from the Embermage. A rain of firebolts. A storm contained in a vortex of wind that turns your nearby cousins to ash. Sometimes, when a whelpling dies, they explode into icy bolts that freeze nearby friends. Sometimes, the Embermage gets all its health back for no apparent reason. Sometimes, the ground shakes and a meteor falls from the sky, as if to drive the point home.\n\nYou want to cry out, as the end approaches, but you can't. You've been magically silenced by a nearby raven, who has eaten an egg and is - temporarily - a crab. The crab-raven then summons a nether imp, five skeleton archers, and a zombie, before flying over and stealing your shoes and your money. The name on the crab-raven's tag is 'George Orwell'.\n\nI am gone by the time the first prismatic bolt hits you. The last thing you see is a familiar pattern of lights bursting beyond the treeline: me, doing exactly the same thing to those undead dwarves down the road. The last thing you think is this:\n\n"Oh, man. I'm not even special ."\n\nIt's fine! It's the good kind of fire!\nAs an action-RPG, the best thing about Torchlight II is the way that loot, skill choice and chance bubbles over into a fountain of light and treasure at the whiff of a right-click, every single time, for as long as you can keep going. As an action-RPG, the worst thing about Torchlight II is the way that loot, skill choice and chance bubbles over into a fountain of light and treasure at the whiff of a right-click, in the exact same way, for as long as you can keep going.\n\nAfter more than 20 hours I've built my Embermage into a machine for the consumption and processing of monsters. My wands cast random spells when I kill an enemy. My armour reflects melee damage. I have a passive ability that randomly teleports attackers further away. My firestorm plants a fire vulnerability on enemies that my columns of flame capitalise on, explosively. Every point of damage I do fills my charge bar, which ultimately reduces the casting cost of all my spells to zero. When this happens I summon a duplicate of myself, just because I can. I've also got this raven. His name's George. I think you've met.\n\nAs the difficulty rises, it's sometimes necessary to tinker with the machinery: to invest in new skills, or alter the opening moves of my combat rotation. By and large, though, the character I've made worked in act one and she's still working a campaign and a bit later.\n\nYour place in Torchlight II's plot is circumstantial: you're a hero, and that's about it. You're chasing down the villainous Alchemist - one of the original game's protagonists - for reasons that nobody in the game sounds especially concerned about. Character emerges as you settle on a playstyle: I'm a stationary death vortex now , but I could have specced differently - a teleporting, sword-wielding warrior mage, perhaps.\n\nHer love for skeletons is like a truck.\nBesides the Embermage, the other predominantly ranged character is the Outlander: a mobile weapons platform specialising in guns, glaives, and debilitating magic. The Berserker channels spirit animals to augment melee attacks, buffing allies and debuffing foes to build an advantage. The Engineer is a tank that can specialise in heavy weapons or sword-and-shield durability, with the option of swapping out for a massive handheld cannon and an army of robotic pets.\n\nThey're a varied bunch, although the game struggles to communicate precisely how different they are before you start playing. I arrived at the Embermage through a process of experimentation: given the game's hundred levels of character advancement, I recommend you do the same before committing.\n\nLevelling grants you points to spend on attribute boosts and new skills. The two are linked: attributes determine the relative power of your weapon and magic damage, for example, impacting the usefulness of the skills you may choose to invest in. Unlike the original Torchlight, you don't need to invest points in a skill tree to unlock its late-game potential. Instead, new skills open up as you level, allowing for greater dabbling as you progress. The system is over reliant, as many action-RPGs are, on incrementing your power by tiny percentages every time you spend a point and each individual level up can feel inconsequential as a result. In the long term, however, there's a lot of scope for cleverness and creativity.\n\nUnfortunately, Torchlight II limits your ability to respec to undoing the last three skill decisions you made. This effectively prevents shifts in direction at high levels: even though I've built a character I like, I can't change her - and my skill trees are littered with discarded investments. If I want her to be perfect I either need to start again or wait for the inevitable respec mod, and both feel like a compromise. Certainly, it's a system where decisions have consequences: it's just that those consequences are a needless waste of time. In a year where multiple RPGs have figured out that freedom to change your mind actually results in more interesting decisions, not less, this aspect of Torchlight II's design sticks out as an unwelcome manifestation of its early noughties influences.\n\nCertain set pieces mix up the rules: in this section, you have to stay in the light.\nOther aspects are much more gratefully received. Offline play, six player co-op (both online and over LAN) and full mod support are all present, and Steam Cloud support enables the game to benefit from the best bits of modern online integration.\n\nIn terms of features, Torchlight II has tremendous scope. The campaign is randomised from the overworld down, remixing environments and sprinkling them with events that keep the pace up even as you go about the busywork of map clearance. You might kill a sprite who drops a golden key, then go looking for the chest it opens. You might kill a phase beast and enter a pocket-sized challenge stage, or stumble across a hidden side quest that stretches across the whole game.\n\nWhen you finish the campaign, you can start over from where you left off or enter the 'Map Room', a nexus where you can use in-game gold to buy access to randomised dungeons with custom rulesets. A full set of difficulty levels are available from the start, along with a hardcore permadeath mode for the committed. The game bends over backwards to give you options, a limbo act that twists the rest of the way and swallows itself with the provision of mod support. This is a game with a long, community-driven future, one that scrawls an infinity symbol over your potential time investment in effortless freehand.\n\nEver feel like a game knows exactly what buttons to push?\nIt's less successful in terms of scale. There's very little sense of escalation to the environments or encounters: you start in a field, pass through a desert, visit a swamp and spend an awful lot of time in caves. You will be fighting level 1 rat-men at level 1 and level 40 bat-men at level 40: although it apes Diablo II's narrative and structure to a comical degree, Torchlight II doesn't up the stakes in the same way. The short fourth act changes the tone but is thin on surprises.\n\nThe game's stock-in-trade is charm and detail: characterful animations that you'll zoom in to watch, witty item descriptions, the sound","March 20","true","17.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","10","13","3","1"

There goes another undead skeleton's head in\na dungeon as you battle your way to the boss.\n\nClick. Click. You buy your sixth health potion and sell\nyour loot you've acquired from enemies, none of it\ncomplimenting your character build on this playthrough.\n\nClick. Click. Click. You feel yourself blink away painterly\ncolors and DotA-like palettes as Summer-Rain's holds\nyour own hand, clasping the mouse and trying to get it\naway from you.\n\n"Starboy. You haven't slept in close to a day. This has to\nstop." Summer-Rain frowns, her face a mask of worry.\n\nTORCHLIGHT II.\n\n"But... But Summer-!" You stammer, as she wrestles you\nfor control of the mouse. You are about to descend into\nthe Mine where the game's villain, The Alchemist, resides\nand is plotting his evil scheme to take over the world.\n\n"Enough, Starboy! I won't have you wasting time and your\nlife away in front of this DotA-skinned Diablo clone!" Both\nyou and her are jockeying for the mouse, Summer-Rain\nhaving positioned herself to block the keyboard and screen.\n\n"No!" You argue again, "It's made from the people who left\nBlizzard and they made a great ARPG!" You half-yell in clear\nannoyance, blinking away sleep deprivation. Summer-Rain\nsighs. "If it's so good, what are you actually doing in it?"\n\nYou pause and blink. You realize that Summer-Rain is right,\nthat the presentation and visual allure of Torchlight II, the\nsoft painted-photoshop-esque feel of the environments and\ncharacters did gloss over a thing or two about substance.\nEven more damning is that the story (in it's simplicity) is not\neven ambigious or laid to be picked up in pieces throughout\nthe world- it's just not there.\n\nSummer-Rain realized that she's slowly working towards\ngetting you back to the real world after you missed a day's\nworth of classes and a lunch date with her. She looks at you\nwith a mix of worry, concern and exasperation. "Starboy, I\nknow how much you like ARPGs. Van Helsing, the original\nDiablo we all grew up with..." She motions to Torchlight II's\nmovements on the screen, with its beauty trying to invite\nyou back in. "Come on, Starboy. I know the  game is\ngood... but is it really THAT good...?"\n\nYou blink slowly, trying to get your bearings on time and\nwhat you've been doing. Over a hundred hours in a game\nthat puts the modern Diablo's mechanics and design choices\nto shame. Made by legit ex-Blizzard staff. Four large levels\nwhere the game takes place across. A great visual backdrop.\nFour classes and weird pets to take across your journey.\n\nBut Summer-Rain was right. What journey? Although it has\nanimated cutscenes, they were done in Flash in a minimal\nanimated style that fit in with the world, but after pointing it\nout, Summer-Rain had an excellent point. It just dropped you\nin something where the world was in crisis, and you didn't\nknow that the villain of Torchlight II; The Alchemist, was a\nprevious character class who went evil in this one and you had\nto stop him.\n\nBut how did he become evil? What was the main reason you\nwent after him other than saving two other people across your\njourney, who were also returning classes from the previous\nTorchlight?\n\nWhy did the Alchemist become evil? Why should you care?\n\nAnd then it dawned on you, whispering the answer as if in a\ndaze. "The gameplay." Summer-Rain looks at you, thinking\nher boyfriend now a mindless vegetable and she might need\nto knock on Runic Software's doors with her family sword.\n"I'm sorry...?"\n\nYou look up at her as if you received divine revelation.\n"Summer... the game works on Souls logic. The gameplay,\nvisual style and enemy variety will hold the player's attention\nindefinitely, even if the story is told through the occassional\ncutscene, sparse notes you read and the even rarer character\ninteraction which is voiced... somewhat." Summer-Rain heaves\na sigh of relief and smiles a bit, putting her hands on her hips\nand giving you another exasperated look.\n\n"What am I gonna do with you, Starboy..."\n\nYou look at Torchlight II running, before you quit to the main\nmenu. Summer-Rain looks on at what you are doing, before\nyou realize something that should have been a deal-breaker\nwith Torchlight II. "Damn it, Summer. This game is good...\nbut you're right. It should be a casual Diablo- no, it IS a casual\nDiablo." You turn to Summer-Rain, who looks at you with a\nquizzical look, not knowing what point you are trying to make.\n\n"It's a very good game... visually brilliant, tight controls and\nexcellent variety from character design, loot and items, pets,\nspells, progression tree and enemy types... but you're right.\nThe story is a bit lacking, even though it tries to be vague\nand it can technically function without one." You get up from\nyour chair and stretch as you prepare to switch off the PC.\n\n"But the fact you have to create another 3rd-party account\ndespite it being on Steam is pretty much a bummer for an\nARPG." Summer-Rain scrunches her face, clearly disgusted\nby the practice of unneccessary DRM. "Did the first Torchlight\nhave DRM like that?" She asks. You look back at her as you\ngrab your towel.\n\n"No, Summer. The first Torchlight is on GOG, even." Her jaw\ndrops, as your give a few nods with a look of disappointment.\nShe looks at the now-turned-off computer. "Would you still\nrecommend it to people though, Starboy?" You nod back.\n"Yeah. A good game is a good game, you know. People\nshould try it at least before anything." Summer-Rain's mouth\ncurls slightly into a sly smirk. "I tried it and didn't enjoy it...\nyou did and I didn't see my boyfriend in class for a day and\nhe missed his lunch date with me." She pouts.\n\n"Gimme 10 minutes. I'm going to take you to dinner to make\nit up to you." Summer-Rain rolls her eyes and shoves past\nyou, stealing your towel as you struggle to run past her.\n"5 minutes for you, Starboy- and I think that's more than\ngenerous!" She smiles mischievously, before sticking her\ntongue at you.\n\n"Summer!"\n\nTORCHLIGHT II.\n\n\n","February 28","true","109.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","7","9","2","5"

Torchlight II adds a few new things such as fishing activities and pets (which you can send back to town to sell things for you and other things as well)  With the updated graphics (compared to Diablo II days of gaming, newer games as far as graphics go it holds it own but has a "Cartoon" look to it.)

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/outlaw953/recommended/200710/","outlaw953","Metal Bison [33rd]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/outlaw953/","263 products in account","*Before beginning, I would like to give a special thanks to X Phantom for critiquing this review.\nMuch can be said about the successes of dungeon crawling roleplaying games preceding the Diablo series. Torchlight, however, has lived up to, if not exceeded, the expectations of the genre has set throughout its creation over twenty years ago. What I call ‘colorful Diablo,’ Torchlight II is, as stated, a dungeon crawling roleplaying game set in a fantasy environment with various classes and subsequent styles of play. This title maintains a steampunk theme and a few fan-made overhauls may alter simple displays such as the health meter, but may range to altering the system entirely. I have played this title solo, with friends, and online-though this final occurrence can be rare due to the lack of an overall online community-and can honestly declare that any group size is adequate for play.\nHere are just a few things that I found of interest in this title:\n\nMultiplayer - Though Torchlight II can be played solo, the experience is enhanced greatly through cooperative play; the genre typically requires such. This title allows the player to create sessions for friends or strangers to play online or on a local network. A staple for dungeon crawlers can be seen in this game as enemy mobs become increasingly difficult with each additional player added, which also escalates the amount of loot acquired as well as the rarity of said items. As always, cooperation is key since monsters throughout the overworld become more powerful, adding to the play value of Torchlight II. In summary: garb your friends, or I will gladly play with you if your friends do not own this game.\n\nGameplay - Torchlight II’s combat system is quite simple: click to move and attack, with the Number keys serving as a layout for implementable items and abilities. Other keys can be utilized for certain actions-such as holding down Shift to remain still while attacking-but the core combat retains the simplistic style of the classics. As players gain levels by instilling the ‘f*** up everything in sight’ clause, they gain attribute points which passively improve specific aspects of the character such as Strength and Defense statistics, as well as upgrades to level-specific skills such as the Engineer’s Spider Mines. New items in the form of loot can be obtained from defeated enemies. Said items add to character customization as well as developing a build in which players can utilize their own set of tactics within the game’s limits. The system is actually quite intricate with bonuses influencing the various class skills. Simple fishing holes are also scattered throughout each area, which grant another mini-game and new items to the players.\n\nMap Layout - Each area the player treks to has its own theme and general appearance. For example, you can expect the Blightbogs to assume a marshy look and contain enemies that are apparent to the given scene. These settings have simple background pieces that add to the landscape without distracting the players from combat and exploration, while the map itself is entirely nonsymmetrical-this presents a more realistic stage. Quests typical face the player across the massive span of each set-piece; I have found this to be quite entertaining seeing as though I, myself, tend to explore every inch of the map regardless. Secrets such as golden chests-requiring the defeat of a monster with the designated key to open-as well as mysterious portals to bonus stages are strewn throughout the world.\n\nTL:DR - I had wanted to mention several other functions of Torchlight II such as its dedicated Steam Workshop contributors and fluid graphics style. I have seen that, as a collective opinion by many of its players, this is one of the few games in which the story is disregarded, yet the game itself is highly enjoyable beyond its writing. I would highly recommend Torchlight II to anyone who enjoys dungeon crawlers and roleplaying game character building because this game is just more Diable, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Thanks for reading.\n\nDo you enjoy these reviews?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mendozacheers/recommended/200710/","mendozacheers","Mendozacheers","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mendozacheers/","4519 products in account","The sequel to the game that brought back Hack 'n' Slash, or so I seem to believe. This genre was pretty much dead until the first Torchlight came out. If Torchlight I would have been released as the same time as AAA Hack 'n' Slash, it would never have gotten any attention and there might not have been a Torchligh II. Torchlight I was just an indie, but the lack of any other Hack 'n' Slash led people to praise the game a lot. Rightfully so, original Torchlight was a very unique game while maintaining the atmosphere from Diablo 2. Torchlight II very much picks up from there, it's a sequel that does everything right.\n\nTorchlight II is much bigger, has more characters, more loot, more enemies, more levels, more more more. The game also looks a lot better than the original, but has the same art-style to it, that keeps that atmosphere that made the original great. The armosphere will remind you a lot of Diablo 2, since some of the guys who made Lord of Destruction have been working on the Torchlight games. While the art-style is a new thing to the Torchlight games, the music and ambient sounds is what makes this game so similar to Diablo 2.\n\nOne of the more important additions to Torchlight II was Co-op, which the fans were just screaming for. These type of games are best enjoyed with a cold glass of co-op to be honest, and the original Torchlight suffered from the lack of it. Up to 6 players can now join together and hack and slash together, gather loot, trade items and win epic boss fights. You have 4 classes to choose from instead of 3 from the original Torchlight; Embermage, Berserker, Outlander and Engineer. The Embermage is obviously a mage, the Berserker delivers fast melee combat, the Outlander is range and the Engineer is melee with a lot of damage output - but not as fast as Berserker.\n\nThanks to the already interested fans of the series, the game did surprisingly well even though released just a few months after Blizzard's Diablo III. If the original game didn't do so well, this game would have had really hard to survive. The player base for Torchlight II has stayed strong for long and not until now it starts to disperse. Not sure what Runic Games are doing at the moment, but I am guessing that additional content will be added. A few minor updates have been released since launch, including Steam Workshop support for user-created mods. I would be really surprised if they didn't make a big Expansion Pack for it, considering how well it has sold.\n\nPersonally I played through the game, not once, not twice but three times for a NG++ and a level 100 Embermage. I just could not stop, it was endless amount of fun, and I wish to return soon, maybe if there is new content. One of the few games that I completed, and so fast too. I am not a huge hack 'n' slash fan either I never enjoyed Diablo 2 for example.\n\nI highly recommend picking this up, alone or with friends - does not matter. This game is amazing!","May 18, 2013","true","95.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/200710/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Torchlight II's story follows the events of the first game, although those who come into the game without playing the original will not be missing much. Players create their own hero from one of four new classes, and are tasked with preventing one of the original heroes, who has been corrupted, from bringing ruin to the world. The story serves its purpose of giving players a reason to head off for the next quest goal but for the most part is pretty negligible, with the exception of a few rare quests of interest.\n\nThe options for character creation are expanded from the original; there are now four classes and each class has options for its gender, hair, and face. Pets also make a return, with a number of new creatures added. The pets are welcome companions, assisting the player by participating in combat, learning spells, being able to summon minions of their own, and even travelling back to town to sell loot and buy potions so the player doesn't have to.\n\nBasic gameplay follows the template used by other isometric and top-down action RPGs. Players move using the left mouse buttons and click on enemies to attack. There are a wide number of skills and spells available, with numerous ways to activate them through various hotkeys and on-screen icons. The game allows for a lot of variety in builds and play styles, with each level up providing points to add to attributes and to upgrade and learn skills. Also provided is a lot of variety in equipment with no class restrictions, with the exception of some unique loot, although a number of skills require a certain weapon type. Loot in the game is plentiful, but fortunately the game makes it very easy to compare picked up loot with that currently equipped and to switch it into the pet's inventory so it can be quickly sold. There will always be the occasional pause midway through a dungeon to conduct some inventory management, however, outside of these pauses the pacing is quick and keeps the action going at an engaging level.\n\nThe dungeons are randomly generated in terms of overall layout, but specific areas like boss arenas are preset. This means that when playing multiplayer or a new game plus, it isn't a matter of simply retreading old routes, and the highly enjoyable exploration experience that the dungeons provide is always there. There is always a danger of such generated dungeons becoming generic and repetitive but it is pleasing to report that the danger has been negated as well as could be hoped for. A number of tougher enemies and special challenge zones litter Torchlight II's areas, providing fairly regular breaks from the usual fodder (who can still pack a punch if players aren't paying attention) and making sure things don't get too repetitive. The player character can become briefly stuck in a crowd that's difficult to maneuver out of, but these situations are rare and typically caused by charging in too wildly rather than through any fault of the game.\n\nWith the exception of Hardcore mode, where death is permanent, players can respawn without too much consequence. A percentage of gold can be paid in order for the deceased character to reappear either where they died or at the map entrance. Alternatively they can respawn back in town for free. There are four difficulty options to choose from plus a toggle for the aforementioned Hardcore mode. The Normal difficulty is a decent, but not especially challenging, level for newcomers, so experienced Torchlight players will likely want to jump immediately into Veteran.\n\nDifficulty in multiplayer is handled well, with monsters increasing in toughness depending on the number of players. While it's certainly not necessarily to enjoy what Torchlight II has to offer, there can be no denying the enjoyment of playing the game with others and it adds a more than welcome dimension to the game. Those afraid of having their loot taken by comrades need not fear, as players get their own sets of loot visible only to them. There is plenty of postgame content for players to sink their teeth into after completing the twenty hour or so main campaign, either by tackling one of the main postgame dungeons or by starting a new game plus, which keeps the player's progress but levels up all the opponents to match. New game plus might disappoint some, as it isn't possible to notch up the difficulty, so those hoping for a greater challenge in the main story will need to start a new character. The game has also been created with the modding community in mind, so even if Runic's postgame options run out there will likely be plenty of fan-made offerings.\n\nVisually the game looks great, even on less powerful computers, and for the most part runs very smoothly. The art style is great, the environments are all nicely varied, and the UI is clear and easy to use. Even when hidden behind terrain, it's easy to see where the character is and to click on enemies thanks to a coloured outline that appears for any combatant potentially obscured. Spells and skills are all beautifully animated, and it's incredibly satisfying to see enemies explode upon being finished off with a critical hit. Voice acting is generally rare, but it doesn't feel like the game is missing much without it. The key quest givers and few animated cutscenes are voiced, and it's functional for getting the next task across, but there's not enough of it to have any major effect and can be easily ignored without anything being missed.\n\nFor me Torchlight II was an immensely enjoyable experience from start to finish. The game is more than welcoming for both fans of the original and newcomers to the series and is high amongst the better gaming experiences I've had this year. It might not bring anything particularly new to the genre, but those who choose to pick it up will be provided with superb value for their money.\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","January 13, 2015","true","34.9"," 26 of 46 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","26","46","0","3"

I am happy I finally have a computer I can play T2 with ease, as I spend many hours with it's prequel and was quite hyped to play this one.\nI love the multum of possibilities of seemingly narrow range of heroes, and I'm all about doing those hybrid characters.\nTwo things are a big minus to me: firstly, building a successful summoner class takes quite a lot of time in higher difficulty modes. Secondly, Act III monsters are just cheap (besides the epic boss fights) and take away much of the lore's momentum - so if you feel doubts in Act III, keep pushing until You reach those Dwarven ruins. Either way, I think it's very easy to ommit how wonderful of a universe Torchlight has, with it's little details that can slip your attention if you play too fast. It's a lore very prone to development and alteration, and I'm also happy to see some very lore-friendly mods.\nAwesome game worth a recommendation!","May 21","true","30.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

Nothing really jumped out at me, even for 11 levels of gameplay.\n\nImagine my surprise when I actually upped the difficulty from Normal to Veteran, and installed the Synergies Mod.  Now, it's tough to put down!\n\nTorchlight II comes highly recommended.  The game itself is really pretty solid, and once you up the difficulty, the gameplay actually becomes compelling and fun.  You'll be on the edge of your seat when the fights get tougher and tougher, and it feels more rewarding.\n\nOne downside is that the devs seem to have called "mission accomplished" on the game and left to start their next project.  Support it, therefore, nearly non-existent.  Fortunately, they released the GUTS tool, which allows modders a great deal of control over the game.  Synergies is one such game that has taken it to a whole new level.  With a total conversion that alters over 16,000 files, adds 3 classes, a new city, and tons of end-game content, it really shows that this game will have great longevity and replay value through the Workshop alone.\n\nPick it up cheap, set it to Veteran or higher, and start playing around with some mods.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/recommended/200710/","Anitude","Annie T. Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","An incredibly simplistic Diablo-esque ARPG with Steam Workshop support to possibly enhance replayability.\nBefore starting the game you're given the option to start the vanilla version and the Workshop supported version. You can move your vanilla character to the Workshop version however the character you save your progress with Workshop mods on will no longer be allowed back to the vanilla game.\n\nThe game's difficulties range from Casual, Normal, Veteran, & Elite where the differences in these are that the gold drops are lower and enemy damage & health are increased the higher the setting. In Elite mode the game doesn't just feel harder, it feels like more like an endurance because I found myself constantly having to hit, run, heal, hit, run, heal, and repeat wasting more time than I should be wasting if I was on Veteran because everything on Elite can kill you in a flash and it doesn't help that the baddies take a hell of a lot longer to kill because of the artificial difficulty of increased baddie HP.\nThere's a an option to check whether or not you want to activate "Hardcore" mode for the rest of a character's playthrough where all it means is that one death means you can't play that character anymore so this is really for those who like to be more pressured into being careful to stay alive.\n\nUnlike the first game you now have a choice of 4 classes however the previous classes have been removed though they all use similar & new equipment as the first. Each class has a handful amount of unique skills but I've found that I was really only putting points in an incredibly low amount of them all the way up to the end-game & max level, 100, leaving probably 80% of the skills without even a single point placed. Though effective this leaves the combat to show how simplistic its action is which all-in-all is just hit, run, & maybe heal. No matter how fancy the skills you've put the points on it's still just run, attack, run, and possibly heal up with a potion or a spell so should heavy damage be taken. You can only "respec" the last 3 skills you've placed points on so you can do a small bit of testing to find out what suits your preference.\n\nThe controls for the game are typical isometric ARPG style with the all too likely-to-become problematic mouse-to-move and extensively rebindable keys with the exception of the mouse buttons being unrebindable. I found that the mouse controls can often be wonky; when I try to move to the opposite side of a crowd of baddies to get away from them for some reason the character would sometimes move to them and attack instead despite the mouse being nowhere near them. During critical situations it becomes an incredible nuisance.\n\nThough very diverse in skins, models, & sounds almost all enemy attacks are similar to one another so I found that fighting just became repetitive with the exception of having some new skills to toy with but still overall becomes the same hit & run rule in combat. Even the bosses are fought the same and the way they fight you feel hardly any different from mob attacks.\n\nThe environment as well are very limited in variety. The general idea of different types of environment aside from the scenery with some different turns and slight elevations are "don't walk on this right now or you'll get hurt", some levers or switches you have to activate to progress the game, and putting items in environmental sockets to again further progress.\n\nNormally when anything dies in a map they stay dead. When setting your game to an "internet" session you can "reset" the entire world so everything can be killed again. Even all the treasure chests will be up for another round of loot.\nThe multiplayer's functional & pretty basic; go to the lobby, make or join someone's session, and you just play from there either helping one another or doing your own things. Each person in a multiplayer session sees & gets their own loot from drops so there won't really be any stealing of items. If you and some other people have the exact same mods and sometimes load order of mods you can play the modded game with those people.\n\nDespite all its "problems" and for what it is the game works and does pretty well at what it tries to be even if there's not a whole lot new or special when compared to many other ARPGs like this. It can be good fun to just isometrically dungeon crawl seemingly killing endlessly especially with someone you know but because it lacks special things it can start to be incredibly tedious & repetitive incredibly fast where your only possible source of replayability is likely trying out the different classes, workshop mods, and/or the multiplayer.","August 10, 2015","true","89.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Or maybe I should put it wanderous? Yes, I know it's not an actual word, continue on.\n\nTorchlight II is a game of deep, enthralling exploration and the subsequent battles for glory, fame, and of course, loot drops that follow throughout this excursion. You must choose a character to harness your abilities from the four available classes: Outlander - Ranged weapons; Embermage - More spells than Harry Potter; Berserker - Right up in your face, meat slicing action; Engineer - A combo of ranged/up-front-and-personal weapons with robots. Each role serves a purpose whether you are in a party of 1 or a whole crew of 4. I personally played with a friend who manned Outlander while I played Engineer.\n\nThroughout my journey, I roasted, toasted, grinded, and gibbed more monsters than I can recall and had a blast quite literally. I will mention that I had not played Torchlight I or any other top-down RPG before playing Torchlight II. As an introduction to this fantastic genre, Torchlight II touched all the bases any game should: Engaging and exciting gameplay; balanced classes, enemies, and loot; and content that progresses and evolves to a greater level by the end of the game. Throw in a soundtrack that perfectly matches the ambiance and you've got a smoldering fire of a game.\n\nIt is important to note that I had a friend to play with during my adventure, so this may influence one's opinion on this game. I am considering going through and playing it again, the only thing holding me back is my circadian rhythm - I'm not quite sure it's ready for a re-run.\n\nFinal Ratings\nGameplay: 10/10 - Never was bored, definitely stayed up way too late.\n\nStoryline: 7/10 - Not too hard to follow but I probably would've had an easier time had I played Torchlight I.\n\nCombat: 7/10 - Not confusing, easy to learn, a multitude of abilities to keep each encounter varied. I blasted through the enemies on Normal on my first run-through. I would recommend playing on Hard as the final boss seemed easier than expected. On Normal it's easy to get hyper-leveled if you love grinding enemies.\n\nScary? Nope - Cartoony sense of fun\n\nPop-Ups: None, it's top-down silly!\n\nGraphics: 7.5/10 - Cartoony and fun\n\n100% Achievements: Not easy. Requires multiple playthroughs. Definitely need some luck too for a couple.\n\nSingleplayer: N/A - Did not play by myself.\n\nReplayability: High replay value, I definitely see myself going through this game at least another time. Not to mention, there are copious amounts of scenarios to do after the main story line.\n\nMultiplayer: 10/10 - Wholeheartedly recommend playing with a friend or friends.","June 18, 2015","true","34.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

We're not going to go about reviewing this game that way - not because they're not comparable or not in the same genre, but because it's like pitting apples vs oranges, or Star Trek vs Star Wars.  Just because two games, shows, or fruits share a few features doesn't mean you can really place one over the other.\n\nSo, where to begin...\n\nTorchlight II offers so, so much to fans of classic dungeon crawler ARPG's.  It offers 4 dynamic classes with 3 skill trees which allow you to mix and match skills at will; attribute points for stats that are all useful to every character in their own way; secret rooms usually accessed through puzzles; epic boss battles; gigantic world chests that require a key that drops from a specific mob; portals to other dimensions filled with loot; both shared and personal stashes; and - last but not least - pets.\n\nPets are a really unique addition to Torchlight II that satisfy the loot hoarder in each of us.  While out adventuring, your pet will carry all of your unwanted loot back to town.  In addition to this, they will assist you in battle, cast spells, and go shopping for basic supplies.  No feeding necessary!\n\nSomething else that's both unique and awesome about this game is its mod-friendly attitude.  It offers a very helpful mod kit for any who are interested in expanding Torchlight II's horizons, and actively supports said mods with online play.\n\nSpeaking of online play, Torchlight II is an  excellent  game to play with your friends!  Don't forget, if you guys are playing a modded version of the game you HAVE to not only be subscribed to the same mods but have the mods in the same load order as well.\n\nTorchlight II is fantastic to play solo.  Nearly all of my 200+ hours in this game have been spent alone, tearing through the wilderness of Torchlight.  From level 1 to level 100, gameplay is fresh and challenging.  Difficulty can be changed as needed between 4 difficulty settings, and hardcore characters are an option.\n\nBefore I end this review, I must add that the music is FANTASTIC.  It is by far some of the best music I've heard from an ARPG's OST.  Even if you decide not to purchase the game, definitely visit YouTube and give its music a listen - although, it is definitely better when experienced in the settings meant for it ;)","April 16","true","221.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","0"

You can play this game well enough on a laptop with an intergrated card or on a beefy desktop machine.Some have claimed they got it to run on their tablets as well.\n\nThere are 4 classes each that are non traditional but play like hybrids of traditional classes melded together.Engie (Paladin/Warrior/bot summoner) ,Outlander(Gunslinger/Ninja), Beserker(Crazed Monk/Beastman),& Embermage (Element Assault/Support) sorry no dedicated healers in this game.You are free to pick and choose what skills(active and/or passive) you will use.Six player is the default online max,but mods can increase this.\n\nThe game itself has an overworld and dungeons littered throughout it.Throughout it you will find tons of loot,mobs,champion enemies,bosses,traps,and hidden secrets to find. The presentation for the areas are well done and add to making your travels more enjoyable.You have a pet in game that has basic attacks,can be used to buy/sell things for you while you battle on.\n\nThe story of the game countines from a small time after the ending of events in Torchlight 1 but you do not need to know anything of the story to get into Torchlight 2. The ending of torchlight 1 makes up the story of whats happening in TL2 which you will be told.The story is interesting enough if you wish to follow it , but not required to play through the game like most crawlers.\n\nA warning though, the online portion in this game can be either great or a bit laggy.

Overall I reccomend this game because it has online multiplayer, a good player progression system and a decent storyline.","January 3, 2014","true","43.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/200710/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","This is a long review, so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend Torchlight 2 skip to Results and read from there.\n\nRunic Games provides us with an invigorating spin to your standard RPG game with dynamic evolving dungeons. Unlike most AI managers Torchlight II doesn’t just update enemy spawns, but also creates new terrain with each experience.\n\nStory:\nTorchlight II takes place in a time far beyond the reign of Ordrak the daemon who caused dismay to the little town of Torchlight; yet, despite his fall the corruption he spread was not lost. An evil alchemist takes up his power and destroys the town of Torchlight as your quest begins to bring civility back to reality. You progress through the various worlds of the Torchlight universe from various towns in unique environments from mountains, desserts, tundra’s, and swamps. There is no end to the evil that Ordrak spirit has spread.\n\nCampaign:\nTorchlight II is separated into four Acts: Estherian Steppes, Mana Wastes, Grunnheim, and Broken Mines. Unlike in the first Torchlight the second offers multiple towns which provide unique experiences that help evolve the game. Each town offers unique merchants that evolve with the difficulty of the game providing better items and new elements to the mix. The campaign, depending on your play style, can easily last up to 30-hours. The game has a good difficulty curve which allows the game to readily scale to the player’s level. Plus by utilizing the randomly generated experience the game offers players can also out-level their environments if they feel like they the game is too difficult.\n\nGameplay:\nTorchlight II expands on the original by providing four rather than three unique experiences: The Engineer, Outlander, Berserker, and Embermage.\nThe Engineer is a melee class which utilizes heavy armor and has abilities to summon various support style minions. My main complication with the Engineer is that this task is clearly designed around being a support/tank role, but has not taunting abilities. This essentially makes team work relatively difficult as you cannot get your enemies to readily focus on you.\nThe Outlander similar to the Vanquisher is a rained base class that utilizes mainly dexterity based building. This class offers trapping, dual wielding, and high speed attacks. The design of the outlander makes it great for kiting and boss fights, but relatively poor against swarms of enemies.\nThe Beserker follows your typical fighting class by utilizing melee weapons with high speed combat and not being reliant on armor. The unique playstyle of the Beserker allows you to summon wolves to your aid, throw down with massive melee damage, and utilize frost and lightning buffers to enhance your combat. The beserker does great with live recovery items and high health units, but can easily get swarmed by low hit point units.\nFinally the Embermage, which as you can tell is a magic class champion. Focusing on mostly magic attributes the Embermage utilizes spellcasting to defeat their enemies. This is the only class I didn’t beat the game with, but from my understanding they are incredibly useful for supporting roles and are as strong as they are in mana. Mostly focusing on mana stealing items and mana pots this class fights at range and doesn’t do well in swarms.\n\nSadly Torchlight II did not adjust the control mechanics that are utilized through Torchlight I. The champion is still controlled entirely by the users mouse. Moving the character and attaching are both controlled by holding the left click of the mouse, rather than moving with the keyboard and fighting with the mouse. On Melee classes this is fine, but on ranged classes more than not you run into battle because you click next to an enemy; because your champion ran into battle they are then killed and your kiting has failed.\n\nHints:\n>Make sure to get the spell that allows you to drop a town portal, drop this in every dungeon to make sure you do not have to fight your way back due to random generated dungeons.\n>Once a player leaves a dungeon there is approximately a 20-minute timer before regenerating, Meaning if you are in a dungeon that has multiple floors you may have to fight your way back through if you die closer to the end without a portal to get you back.\n>Playing as a group causes more enemies to spawn meaning playing with your friends doesn’t change the difficulty.\n>Make sure to put items on your pet. Your pet can hold two spells, two rings, and a necklace.  By putting in the proper sockets and maximizing your pet effectively can make for a great tank and an amazing support.\n>I found the best spells for your pet are “Frost” and “Heal All” this allows your pet to slow enemies and heal the team.\n>Send your pet back to town when you get the chance, this sells the items it is holding and heals it to full health.\n\n\nResults:\nI personally played Torchlight II before completing Torchlight I. This game provides a unique experience somewhere in between Diablo III and Spelunky. Through randomly generated dungeons and it’s combat experience Torchlight II is guaranteed to provide your typical RPG style player with an enjoyable dynamic experience; although the generated dungeons don’t provide much replay value with the same class they are just a touch unique enough to make playing each other class fun and original. Even though I purchased this game on sale I would still recommend it at full price.\n\nPros:\n+Four unique classes that provide diversifying experiences through their unique playstyles and skill trees.\n+Multiplayer cooperative experience\n+Pets which provide benefit to the player as either a way to sell items, a some-what tank, or even a healer.\n+Two types of leveling for a character: Experience and Fame. Fame allows you to level only your abilities, while experience gives you five points to level your characters base stats and a point to level abilities.\n+Dynamic environment that evolves and changes each play through.\n+Fun bosses that offer interesting battles that vary based on swarming, spell dodging, terrain shifting, and time management.\n\nCons:\n-Character controls that sadly cannot be adjusted. You must control your character with the mouse for both movement and combat, which causes a lot of times where you die due to poor controls rather than skill.\n-Random generated dungeons occur on time base rather than if the player quits. This means if you are in an areas sub-dungeon it is possible the first floor regenerates. Ultimately this means if you die you must start over again.\n-Fishing provides your pet with cool skin/ability changes, but typically is more cumbersome than it’s worth. Similar to the first Torchlight you just simply wait as a circle expands and retracts until it hits the middle for a fraction of a second where you must click the reel in button.","February 20","true","60.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

Each one has 3 skill trees, which you can use any tree as long as your the at the level requirement for it, your not restricted to 1 tree, you can put points anywhere.  The item drops are fun, you get plenty of rare items.  Story, I never follow the story line so I cant comment on that (same for all games).  End Game is either playing through the game again with monsters leveled up, or using maps in the Mapworks.   Maps you can purchase at a vendor and they all have stats, like +% Fire Damage, +% More Gold, and/or +% Damage for Monsters.  I've only played an Embermage lvl 100 NG++, and a 56 Beserker.\n\n9/10","January 28, 2014","true","202.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

What a twist. And the general story of this one is pretty interesting.\nNice gameplay, Instead of having a few infinite boring dungeons like the first one, this game offers an open world feel where you come across dungeons here and there. Really nice. The vanilla version offers 4 creative classes that you can play in many ways. A LOT of loot to collect and everything is just fun. AND this one has multiplayer where you can get kicked from games by people who don't speak English! I bet you're convinced now. But if the game itself doesn't satisfy you, there are countless of mods through workshop!\nNice graphics, looks better than the first one and kind of gives a World of Warcraft art feel. I like it and you don't need an amazing system to run it. If my flea market 50 dollar can run this pretty much lag free, I'm pretty sure you guys can run it.\nWhat else is there to cover? Pretty much everything is great about it, one of my favorite dungeon crawlers.\n\noh yeah, the con: 4 of the achievements are unachieveable, they're broken. Runic knows this and refuses to remove them purposely. IN FACT, they are using these broken achievements as a marketing tool. During one of the steam sales they changed the name of these achievements to "Queued for Removal" to draw in the completionist to buy this game. But right after the sale ended, you want to know what happened? They changed the name of the achievements right back to "Unachieveable". They could easily remove these achievements no problem. Damn you Runic and your..and your gay parties.\n\nBut yeah that's about it, besides Runic being butt munches, this game is perfect and I'd recommend buying it.\n\nTL;DR: GG","January 6, 2014","true","208.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Both games have 4 Acts. Each Act has its own hub town, bosses, unique geographic setting and a narrated cinematic at each Act's beginning. Even the storyline has a lot of similarities.\n\nWith all that said, Torchlight 2 clearly wasn't designed to be novel. Instead they set out to do the dungeon crawler genre really, really well. And they succeeded.\n\nThe gameplay is fast paced, addictive, loot filled fun. Everything about this game is user friendly. It's easy to get to and from town; your pet can easily be sent to sell off your unwanted spoils while you keep adventuring; even playing on the Veteran difficulty I almost never had to buy potions or magic scrolls; quests are clearly marked on the map, never leaving you wondering what to do next; when you die you have the option to respawn in town for free or lose gold but respawn near where you died.\n\nMy main criticism is likely to be experienced differently by each person who plays Torchlight 2. I started to get bored with the game about 3/4ths through the story mode. This is common for me with games of this type. I should note that I played to the end of the game fully in single player. Your mileage may vary particularly if you plan to play online with friends.\n\nI'll close by saying if you did NOT like Diablo 2, or other highly rated dungeon crawlers, do not be swayed by all the positive reviews this game has gotten. Trust your gut; I suspect that the type of person that will enjoy this game already knows that they will enjoy it.","January 27, 2014","true","25.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raynerderine/recommended/200710/","raynerderine","Clover","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raynerderine/","598 products in account","This is gonna get complicated. Ok, let's get this out of the way: the game is quite good. I've played 75 hours, Steam tells me, and I did enjoy them - at least modded. Unmodded, the record would probably be more like 6. There are some great mods that hugely improve what's already a solid base. The reasons I can't recommend it, though, are complex.\n\nFirst off, it's the feel. I do not like the game's aesthetic. It's very cartoonish and detracts from the feel I'd want. The story is forgettable at best, a confusing afterthought with no thought put into it whatsoever at worst, which I suppose you could expect from an ARPG, but... why? It's a spiritual successor to Diablo, right? Diablo 2 especially had a really interesting story. The setting was great, with Good and Evil both presented as Bad, some cool ideas and history, and even genuine characters! With personality! It was also very good-looking for the time, with a dark, interesting aesthetic, rather than the goofy one here that I personally dislike. Admittedly, that's a matter of taste, but this isn't meant to be objective. And the characters are just... nonexistant. The most interesting thing about the setting are a race that's left their bodies behind and are now just animated suits of armor, basically. Which are never really explored anyway.\n\nModded, though, I'd say it's worth the price except for one thing: the existence of Path of Exile.\n\nIn a vacuum? Sure, it's fun. $20 of fun, especially if you're looking for a time sink. Compared to Diablo 3? Yeah, certainly buy this. Compared to Path of Exile, which is free, incredibly innovative, gorgeous, dark, actually has an interesting story, and is simply more fun (in my opinion)? Why bother?\n\nAnd, frankly, even today I'd call it as much fun as Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction at best, at least if you care much about story, atmosphere, or aesthetic. If you don't, and just want gameplay and can seriously ignore all that, go for it. If you do, well there's Path of Exile, or... so how much is Diablo 2: LoD now?\n\nIt should also be mentioned I rather resent the game because I preordered it due to the promise of the toolset, GUTS, being made available "soon" (and even, in one instance, "very soon") after release. Not relevent to you, dear reader, but it was not. And so my high-fallutin' plans fell to ruin as interest waned, until by the time it was released I was sitting by myself, eating ice cream, sobbing, and plotting my revenge. In addition, it requires you to make a Runic games account to use the online service. Not a huge deal, but the principle of the thing bugs me as it wasn't disclosed. So those are my biases against it. Grain of salt and all that. Hope it helped.","February 28, 2014","false","93.2"," 72 of 138 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","72","138","2","0"

Runic Games upped the stakes and 3 years after the release of the first game they came out with a more ambitious, more colourful, more varied and more enjoyable sequel.\n\nWhilst the game features the same gameplay-style as its predecessor, notable (and brand new) elements are the availability of multiplayer and the extended modding capabilities.\n\nAlso, the four playable classes introduced in this episode are brand new and those present in the first game do not return. These classes offer the options to create several builds so fully getting to know the characteristics of a class requires multiple walkthroughs.\n\nPets also return (but with more options) and instead of the retirement of our characters we have the newgame+ mode. Also, a hardcore mode for die-hard fanatics.\n\nTorchlight 2 is a must for Diablo fans. But do bear in mind that this is similar to Diablo 2 and not to its latest installment.","May 7, 2014","true","22.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

TORCHLIGHT 2 !!!\n\nTorchlight II is incredibly polished though I’ve found a few bugs here and there. It’s quite apparent that Runic spent a lot of time making sure that TL2 was ready to ship, something an independent studio has the luxury to do. It shows but there is work to be done to ironed out. To be frank, Torchlight 2 brings very little that's utterly new to the scene. It improves what’s been done before and makes it damned fun to play, definitely a saving grace. The two terrific asides to the notion above is the addition of the Random Dungeon Generator and the modding tools (even though\n\nThe single biggest and best improvement in Torchlight 2 is the addition of cooperative multiplayer. Runic listened to its fans after the original was released and made sure to include it in the sequel. You can tie your Steam account to your Runic account, choose the Internet option and see a lobby filled with games of all levels. Games can be named and given a password for private play or they can be open for anyone to join. As with most lobby type games, you can create a friends list and even filter games to only see games created by your buddies. In addition, games can be created that only friends can join.\n\nSad to say, but there just inst enough good things to say about Torchlight 2, even with the minor issues it does have. It is one of the most refreshingly fun action RPGs i've played in a very long time. Its predecessor was lots of fun too, But with the addition of multiplayer, the dungeon generator and the modding tools, the series becomes something special, something different on the scene and something worthy of your time and money to play.\n\n- XeroSyphon","December 27, 2013","true","135.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Don't let the "cartoony" graphics fool you, this is one *serious* ARPG.  There's almost more loot than you can handle, wonderful character building, and, most importantly, multiplayer - something the previous Torchlight lacked.  Add on mod support and a low cost and you've got one of my favorite games this year.  Grab a 4-pack and slay monsters with your friends; for the price of one triple-A title you and 3 friends will have almost infinite content to keep you occupied.\n\nPros:\n\nLOOT!\nMod Support\nGreat Gamplay\nGreat Soundtrack\n\nCons:\n\nNo Closed Server\n\nIf you're looking for a closed ladder area without mods or console you'll have to look elsewhere, otherwise this is one fun and addictive gaming experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BasilZero/recommended/200710/","BasilZero","Basilicious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BasilZero/","900 products in account","Game: Torchlight 2\nGenre: RPG-Adventure\nDeveloper: Runic Games\nSystem: PC (Steam)\nTotal Score: 92/100\nValue Score: 9.2/10\n\n• Story: 7/10\no Torchlight 2's storyline picks off where Torchlight 1 ended. The Alchemist which was one of the main characters from the first game ended up becoming corrupt thanks to the effects of the last game's villain's heart. Now you who will play as a new character will have to hunt him down and save the world from whatever he is planning to. You'll be going through several towns, dungeons and all sorts of terrain to find the Alchemist. The storyline overall is a bit generic but the side stories and side quests and their importance plays a interesting role within the overall game.\n\n• Characters: 7/10\no Characters from the first game do appear in this game but barely do you interact with them, other than that all the enemies in the game and the characters you meet afterwards are all new but do not hold much substance like other RPGs however the amount of characters especially when it comes to enemy designs is quite huge. The player themselves can also create their own character, choosing the gender, skin color, hair appearance and color amongst other tidbits though you would not probably notice a difference due to the fact the armor you get in the game would make it to where you probably would not care about how you make your character look.\n\n• GamePlay: 10/10\no Torchlight 2's gameplay is very similar to Torchlight 1's with a few new additions. For one, you have the choice to play as 4 different classes: Berserker which is best for close quarters combat and has insane speed, Mechanic is which best as a support character and as a secondary attacker, Outlander which is best with long range attacks and finally Ember Mage which is the equivalent of a Wizard in TL2 which is pretty much self explanatory. Depending on what you choose for skills and equipment you can build your character up to different builds and uses such as having a offensive ember mage instead of a magic user. The user interface is very similar to TL1 which is heavily inspired by Diablo and World of Warcraft. You have access to different features in towns and throughout different dungeons such as the ability to gamble for items, power up items through enchantments (which do not break or de-enchant anymore), to fuse items. Along with that the usual item shop, weapon/armor shop, and the special item/magic shop as well. There are a lot of side quests along with the story's main quests. One of the biggest additions to the game from its predecessor is Online Multiplayer, many people have anticipated this feature and wanted so much from the first game will now get to enjoy it in this game as up to 6 players can connect to each other on TL2's public servers or make their own private server via LAN. All items are exclusive to each player, no player will see another player's item or treasure (this is to prevent any disputes for loot).\n\n• Graphics: 10/10\no Torchlight 2's graphical interfaces, environment and character sprites designs are similar to the first game but further improved with using current technologies making it one of the best looking 2Dish helicopter view games ever made.\n\n• Sound: 10/10\no Torchlight 2 uses voiceovers throughout the majority of the game's main storyline, there will be instances where you will hear voices from other npcs and from yourself during dungeon raids. Torchlight 2's sound effects are both a combination of new effects to the game and uses some effects from the first game. The voiceovers are pretty well done for the characters and the sound effects go nicely with the environment and during the action sequences of cutscenes and battles.\n\n• Music: 8/10\no Torchlight 2 uses similar style of music that the first game used, calm soothing orchestral type music is used mostly in the game, most of the parts of the game it has that unique Star Wars like epic feeling in the background whenever you travel the terrain or go through a town conversing with the NPCs. The developers were also kind enough to allow players to actually have access to the full OST of the game via the Game's folder on the PC, so enjoy the whole OST of Torchlight 2 on your portable mp3 player.\n\n• Length: 10/10\no Torchlight 2's length is possibly its second greatest aspect if not the gameplay, the game's main storyline by itself should take you no more than 20 hours and additional 5-10 hours' worth of grinding and side questing on the side. If that isnt enough, you may do multiple playthroughs with friends or with other characters to see the world of Torchlight through different experiences which of course adds massive appealing value to this aspect.\n\n• Replay Value: 10/10\no One of the best things about most western games is the replay value and TL2 is no exception. The Online multiplayer experience by itself adds great value to the replay value through different experiences and difficulties available for you to choose from. Once you finish the game, you get access to a endless random dungeon which takes you to random environments so you can explore thoroughly for additional treasures and other items. Along with that to add even more value, they added a New Game+ which allows you to play the game all over again using the same character but with a more difficulty twist to the gameplay.\n\n• Player Value: 10/10\no Overall Torchlight 2 expands over the first one and improves in pretty much in every way, despite some network issues it may have from time to time, players will surely enjoy the multiplayer experiences and if not they can dabble on the single player experience which like the multiplayer can be experienced through different difficulties. You have a pretty decent customization options for your characters and can easily build up any class in any possible way. The graphical details have improved from the game, the sound effects and music are kept the similar to the first game. Pretty much TL2 consists of all the good aspects of TL1 plus more.","December 30, 2013","true","59.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

I had a couple of dollars left and I wanted to spend the money on something that interested me. I had bought Torchlight II and haven't touched it for quite some time, since I was not an active Steam user back then. When I first played it, I immediately regretted not playing this sooner.\n\nTorchlight II is, to put in the simplest words, an amazing game. The product is a highly polished game with many surprises hidden around every corner.  The world is randomly generated every time you start a new character/start New Game+ on an existing character so every experience will be a highly unique one. The game really gets to the point; you can immediately delve into the fun of clicking on monsters and annihilating them with your weapons/skills.\n\nAs is said in many other reviews, the story is definitely lacking. I had attempted to follow the story when I first started playing but ended up not caring for the story at all. If you are into an RPG with a rich story, this game is not for you.\n\nGameplay-wise, this game tops it all. You'll be mashing your number hotkeys and your mouse trying to rid of the monsters trying to swarm you. There are many random traps and surprises lurking in every dungeon and area you face. The skills for each character are also special and will leave you wanting to upgrade all your skills. As said before, each dungeon and area is randomly generated, providing a unique experience everytime you play. You will feel a great sense of accomplishment as you finally knock out the final boss of the game. This then leads to the Mapworks, which you can buy with your in-game currency and play special dungeons. Or you can start up NG+ and start your whole adventure again, keep all your character stats but buffing all item drops and monsters.\n\nAll in all, Torchlight II is definitely a game that anyone should check out, even if you do not like RPGs. This game is a must-have on anyone's game list.","May 22, 2014","true","42.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

But there's mods to fix that issue in the Workshop. Oh, yeah. Did I mention all the mods? Theres youre typical "make the game stupidly easy" mods, and "carry a million items" mods.

Growing up with the golden age of '90s cartoon from CN, you start to understand pretty quickly when something is what it is, and not something else, if it doesn't want to be something else that is. Back to the game, I came back to it again and again as the years passed, understanding more and more about it, until one day I got to finish it and said to myself, "this was nice, but is it the best ? ". A few more years passed and the first news of Torchlight started to appear in gaming magazines and online media, so of course I liked a reimagining of the first game that made me love gaming. This time though, we're talking about Torchlight 2, and how it improved on the initial formula, keeping the main cast from the first game, and making them a part of the story in T2. I personally love this game, and have played it quite a while before buying it on steam. I think everyone should have a go at this game, not because it's fun, not because it's cartoonish, not even because it's a great experience, but because it's that type of game that can really show you the amount of dedication the people who made it managed to put into something that you can't even hold in your hand; from the artwork, to the soundtrack, animations, and even the small things, like fishing and moving boards away to find loot, this game shows that true dedication isn't something only present in the first title, but something that can and is transmuted in time, from one game to the next. That and the fact that I can never get tired of seeing my panda pet get on two legs and start fisticuffing from the largest to the smallest enemy. :)\n\nAlso the modding community did a great job making the game more diverse and fitting to the likes of everyone.\n\nIn the end, my initial review for Torchlight 2 still stands, but I just felt like some back story would make it more recognizable to some of you gamers that are like me, and enjoy playing a game that shows of the dedication of some amazing people.\n\nSo to conclude, T2, great RPG experience form the creators of Diablo 1 and 2. :)","December 20, 2013","true","368.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's probably not going to be comparable to Diablo 2, and it's not as deep as PoE for example, but otherwise it's a very polished game that does well in many areas. Compared to Torchlight 1, everything is better.\n\n+ Skill system is better and pretty much all skills have some use now, no more overlapping skills between classes.\n+ Areas are just better. Maps are larger and the smaller pieces that make them up are much more different and interesting. It's probably one of the game's greatest highlights. The minigames also add a lot to the randomness.\n+ Combat takes more effort than mashing 1 skill at the highest difficulty.\n+ Modding.\n\nIt has cons but honestly still feels very polished for the price that it doesn't really matter that much.","June 22, 2014","true","218.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you like any of the Diablo games, then chances are you're going to like this game. It's simple enough, really...four classes to choose from, a good array of skills that you can put points into, and the ability to use any weapon in the game, regardless of your class. I think the best part about this game is you can - technically - build yourself how you want, and still have a class that works well even in increased difficulties. Only real problem is that the increased difficulty doesn't net you any rewards. It's just harder. No increased loot drops, nothin'. Heck, you actually get *less* experience points per kill, and everything is made to be more expensive, while you meanwhile get less gold per drop. There's some "meh" things about this game, but...largely? I enjoy it.

And where Dungeon Siege solved this problem with pack mules in singleplayer and ignored the problem in coop, and where Diablo 3 'solved' it by making all the junk loot worthless (people just like seeing lootsplosions, right? They don't like it for the money its worth, that would be silly!), the Torchlight games solved this with an awesome/adorable ferret with goggles that takes your unwanted gear back to town and sells it for you (and I guess they have other animals that can do the same thing or something).\nBesides solving the one flaw of the genre, Torchlight 2 does everything else right (or at least right enough): Online or LAN coop, ferrets with goggles, crazy explosive spell effects, ferrets with goggles, tons of cool loot, ferrets with goggles, random dungeon layouts and ferrets with goggles.\nAs if all of that wasn't enough, they also have ferrets with goggles!","January 4, 2013","true","612.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BasilZero/recommended/200710/","BasilZero","Basilicious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BasilZero/","900 products in account","Game: Torchlight 2\nGenre: RPG-Adventure\nDeveloper: Runic Games\nSystem: PC (Steam)\nTotal Score: 92/100\nValue Score: 9.2/10\n\n• Story: 7/10\no Torchlight 2's storyline picks off where Torchlight 1 ended. The Alchemist which was one of the main characters from the first game ended up becoming corrupt thanks to the effects of the last game's villain's heart. Now you who will play as a new character will have to hunt him down and save the world from whatever he is planning to. You'll be going through several towns, dungeons and all sorts of terrain to find the Alchemist. The storyline overall is a bit generic but the side stories and side quests and their importance plays a interesting role within the overall game.\n\n• Characters: 7/10\no Characters from the first game do appear in this game but barely do you interact with them, other than that all the enemies in the game and the characters you meet afterwards are all new but do not hold much substance like other RPGs however the amount of characters especially when it comes to enemy designs is quite huge. The player themselves can also create their own character, choosing the gender, skin color, hair appearance and color amongst other tidbits though you would not probably notice a difference due to the fact the armor you get in the game would make it to where you probably would not care about how you make your character look.\n\n• GamePlay: 10/10\no Torchlight 2's gameplay is very similar to Torchlight 1's with a few new additions. For one, you have the choice to play as 4 different classes: Berserker which is best for close quarters combat and has insane speed, Mechanic is which best as a support character and as a secondary attacker, Outlander which is best with long range attacks and finally Ember Mage which is the equivalent of a Wizard in TL2 which is pretty much self explanatory. Depending on what you choose for skills and equipment you can build your character up to different builds and uses such as having a offensive ember mage instead of a magic user. The user interface is very similar to TL1 which is heavily inspired by Diablo and World of Warcraft. You have access to different features in towns and throughout different dungeons such as the ability to gamble for items, power up items through enchantments (which do not break or de-enchant anymore), to fuse items. Along with that the usual item shop, weapon/armor shop, and the special item/magic shop as well. There are a lot of side quests along with the story's main quests. One of the biggest additions to the game from its predecessor is Online Multiplayer, many people have anticipated this feature and wanted so much from the first game will now get to enjoy it in this game as up to 6 players can connect to each other on TL2's public servers or make their own private server via LAN. All items are exclusive to each player, no player will see another player's item or treasure (this is to prevent any disputes for loot).\n\n• Graphics: 10/10\no Torchlight 2's graphical interfaces, environment and character sprites designs are similar to the first game but further improved with using current technologies making it one of the best looking 2Dish helicopter view games ever made.\n\n• Sound: 10/10\no Torchlight 2 uses voiceovers throughout the majority of the game's main storyline, there will be instances where you will hear voices from other npcs and from yourself during dungeon raids. Torchlight 2's sound effects are both a combination of new effects to the game and uses some effects from the first game. The voiceovers are pretty well done for the characters and the sound effects go nicely with the environment and during the action sequences of cutscenes and battles.\n\n• Music: 8/10\no Torchlight 2 uses similar style of music that the first game used, calm soothing orchestral type music is used mostly in the game, most of the parts of the game it has that unique Star Wars like epic feeling in the background whenever you travel the terrain or go through a town conversing with the NPCs. The developers were also kind enough to allow players to actually have access to the full OST of the game via the Game's folder on the PC, so enjoy the whole OST of Torchlight 2 on your portable mp3 player.\n\n• Length: 10/10\no Torchlight 2's length is possibly its second greatest aspect if not the gameplay, the game's main storyline by itself should take you no more than 20 hours and additional 5-10 hours' worth of grinding and side questing on the side. If that isnt enough, you may do multiple playthroughs with friends or with other characters to see the world of Torchlight through different experiences which of course adds massive appealing value to this aspect.\n\n• Replay Value: 10/10\no One of the best things about most western games is the replay value and TL2 is no exception. The Online multiplayer experience by itself adds great value to the replay value through different experiences and difficulties available for you to choose from. Once you finish the game, you get access to a endless random dungeon which takes you to random environments so you can explore thoroughly for additional treasures and other items. Along with that to add even more value, they added a New Game+ which allows you to play the game all over again using the same character but with a more difficulty twist to the gameplay.\n\n• Player Value: 10/10\no Overall Torchlight 2 expands over the first one and improves in pretty much in every way, despite some network issues it may have from time to time, players will surely enjoy the multiplayer experiences and if not they can dabble on the single player experience which like the multiplayer can be experienced through different difficulties. You have a pretty decent customization options for your characters and can easily build up any class in any possible way. The graphical details have improved from the game, the sound effects and music are kept the similar to the first game. Pretty much TL2 consists of all the good aspects of TL1 plus more.","December 30, 2013","true","59.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

I had a couple of dollars left and I wanted to spend the money on something that interested me. I had bought Torchlight II and haven't touched it for quite some time, since I was not an active Steam user back then. When I first played it, I immediately regretted not playing this sooner.\n\nTorchlight II is, to put in the simplest words, an amazing game. The product is a highly polished game with many surprises hidden around every corner.  The world is randomly generated every time you start a new character/start New Game+ on an existing character so every experience will be a highly unique one. The game really gets to the point; you can immediately delve into the fun of clicking on monsters and annihilating them with your weapons/skills.\n\nAs is said in many other reviews, the story is definitely lacking. I had attempted to follow the story when I first started playing but ended up not caring for the story at all. If you are into an RPG with a rich story, this game is not for you.\n\nGameplay-wise, this game tops it all. You'll be mashing your number hotkeys and your mouse trying to rid of the monsters trying to swarm you. There are many random traps and surprises lurking in every dungeon and area you face. The skills for each character are also special and will leave you wanting to upgrade all your skills. As said before, each dungeon and area is randomly generated, providing a unique experience everytime you play. You will feel a great sense of accomplishment as you finally knock out the final boss of the game. This then leads to the Mapworks, which you can buy with your in-game currency and play special dungeons. Or you can start up NG+ and start your whole adventure again, keep all your character stats but buffing all item drops and monsters.\n\nAll in all, Torchlight II is definitely a game that anyone should check out, even if you do not like RPGs. This game is a must-have on anyone's game list.","May 22, 2014","true","42.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

As I write this I've played five or six hours of Torchlight II, but I expect I'll be playing many more, especially with co-op in the mix.  It's an interesting thing.  I always thought I'd hate this game's aesthetic when compared to Diablo III's fire and brimstone, and on top of that assumed Matt Uelmen's compositions were a better fit for darker fantasy, but it all feels quite right here.  And this really is to Torchlight what Diablo II was to Diablo, making it one of the best games to emerge from this particular tradition.","September 21, 2012","true","75.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Besides that, we can see a mix of: good visual style, large customization options, decent gameplay and decent multiplayer. I definetly recomend it, but i understand why some people dislike it: the core gameplay is just "click on monsters see them die" lol, and its really just a matter of "i like or i dislike that" .

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shyataroo/recommended/200710/","shyataroo","Thundercleese","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shyataroo/","266 products in account","Torchlight 2 Review:\n\nFor this review I will make an effort to break down and analyze different major aspects of the game.\n\n1: Story\n2: Graphics\n3. A: GamePlay Mechanics\n3  B: Classes\n3 C: Loot/Equipment\n4: Wrap up and Bonus\n\n1 Story\nThe Setting of the game takes place directly after the events of torchlight 1, the alchemist has broken out of the ember mine that the entirety of Torchlight 1 has taken place in, and you start your character out just outside a major town that he has already been through.\n\nThe vast majority of the Game's story is presented to you through dialogs with the various NPCs that inhabit the area. The actual story itself, in my opinion is nothing special and while they did make a decent effort, ultimately it falls short of really sucking me in. (But lets be honest the story isn't why you play the game is it?) having said that I did appreciate the easter eggs that the developers put in including a reference to a very popular game that came out around the same time that has the same basic formula.\n\n2. Graphics\nThe game has a bright and colorful world with matching art direction. All the creatures, NPCs and classes look great, a refreshing break from the bleak and demonic tropes that are prevelent throughout the genre. The Spell effects are cool and they don't generally get in the way of seeing the monsters and such.  Since the game has lower system requirements than Diablo 3, and starts out in a lower price point,  the equipment and overall graphics aren't quite as impressive as Diablo 3. But, the graphics overall feel more like diablo 2 than diablo 3 does.\n\n3 A. GamePlay Mechanics\nThe Combat is fun and depending on the difficulty, requires a lot of careful consideration on how you build and equip your character. I love it. In many ways, I am reminded of diablo 2 in how the mechanics are structured. Its not quite as deep as diablo 3, but I was not expecting that much.  Movement is fluid, and, thanks to the low system requirements it runs at a solid 60FPS on my iMac from 2010.\n\nYou have 2 different types of leveling you can do. You can Level up traditionally from gettinng experience which allows you to distribute 5 stat points to whatever you want (instead of them automatically being distributed in diablo 3)\n\n3 B: Classes\nThe Vanilla game comes with 4 classes, each look and feel completely different from each other. The Embermage starts out weaker than others, but as you unlock new skills you find yourself with a huge grin on your face as you wipe out legions of enemies. Just don't expect to be able to take more than a few hits.  While with the berzerker you go right up close and personal to the enemies attack quickly and annihilate them. The engineer plays more like a tank, with slow deliberate attacks and skills that allow you to summon helpers to attack enemies or to distract enemies from you. Finally, the Marksman focuses on hit and run from  a-far  with skills that allow for those types of tactics. Natually each of the characters has many skills to choose from that allow for alternate tactics. Unlike Diablo 3, or Path of Exile once you choose a skill, you have to pay to reroll the skills up to 3 previous skill points can be refunded.\n\n3 C: Loot/Equipment\nThe loot and equipment is quite similar to other games in the genre (IE diablo clones), with the standard tropes of rarity (IE normal, magic, rare and unique, and legendary) with increasing number of bonus' to stats depending on rarity. Each Class has two types of unique weaponry, however that doesn't mean you can't equip melee weapons on a mage or on a ranged character.\n\n4. Wrap up:\nI was excited for it because several former developers of diablo 2 were heading up this team. I have played a large amount of the game under VMware while I was waiting for the mac native version. and its safe to say that I've gotten my money, your money, and two other people's money's worth out of the game.The thing that REALLY sold it to me was the Mod Support.\n\n5: Mods!\nWell you've beaten the vanilla game, thats all well and good but are you ready for the REAL fun to begin? download the Synergies Mod. What does it do? Well for starters, it adds 3 new classes, that all feel  like they belong in the game nearly 700!! new pieces of equipment and weapons, new areas to explore, new enemy types, an end-game and raids. not to mention a rebalancing of the existing skills and classes. I would say that its got more content in it than most expansions's do. I cannot reccomend this mod enough. Unfortunately, there is a maximum of 10 mods per game. (this is gotten around by combining mods into 1 large mod pack) And you cannot play with those who do not have the same mods as you.\n\n6. Rating\n\nIn this rating system 5 is average,  which means its plenty good just nothing special, even slightly.\n\nNOTE the scores below are weighted against other games in the genre.\n\nStory: 3/10 There is a story, it ends and has no plot holes. But thats about it.\nGraphics: 5/10 While its not super fancy and flashy like its bigger budget siblings, the art direction is pretty good and ages well\nMechanics 7/10 Again, not as deep as bigger budget entries in the genre but still plenty of fun (and mod support really helps with this aspect)\nSound: 8/10 Matt Uleman (the composer of the dIablo 1 and 2 soundtrack) did the soundtrack for this game and you can hear echos of his earlier work, and its glorious.\nCombat: 5  out of 10 Its not great but it sure is quite a satisfying experience overall.\n","February 5, 2015","true","304.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shyataroo/recommended/200710/","shyataroo","Thundercleese","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shyataroo/","266 products in account","Torchlight 2 Review:\n\nFor this review I will make an effort to break down and analyze different major aspects of the game.\n\n1: Story\n2: Graphics\n3. A: GamePlay Mechanics\n3  B: Classes\n3 C: Loot/Equipment\n4: Wrap up and Bonus\n\n1 Story\nThe Setting of the game takes place directly after the events of torchlight 1, the alchemist has broken out of the ember mine that the entirety of Torchlight 1 has taken place in, and you start your character out just outside a major town that he has already been through.\n\nThe vast majority of the Game's story is presented to you through dialogs with the various NPCs that inhabit the area. The actual story itself, in my opinion is nothing special and while they did make a decent effort, ultimately it falls short of really sucking me in. (But lets be honest the story isn't why you play the game is it?) having said that I did appreciate the easter eggs that the developers put in including a reference to a very popular game that came out around the same time that has the same basic formula.\n\n2. Graphics\nThe game has a bright and colorful world with matching art direction. All the creatures, NPCs and classes look great, a refreshing break from the bleak and demonic tropes that are prevelent throughout the genre. The Spell effects are cool and they don't generally get in the way of seeing the monsters and such.  Since the game has lower system requirements than Diablo 3, and starts out in a lower price point,  the equipment and overall graphics aren't quite as impressive as Diablo 3. But, the graphics overall feel more like diablo 2 than diablo 3 does.\n\n3 A. GamePlay Mechanics\nThe Combat is fun and depending on the difficulty, requires a lot of careful consideration on how you build and equip your character. I love it. In many ways, I am reminded of diablo 2 in how the mechanics are structured. Its not quite as deep as diablo 3, but I was not expecting that much.  Movement is fluid, and, thanks to the low system requirements it runs at a solid 60FPS on my iMac from 2010.\n\nYou have 2 different types of leveling you can do. You can Level up traditionally from gettinng experience which allows you to distribute 5 stat points to whatever you want (instead of them automatically being distributed in diablo 3)\n\n3 B: Classes\nThe Vanilla game comes with 4 classes, each look and feel completely different from each other. The Embermage starts out weaker than others, but as you unlock new skills you find yourself with a huge grin on your face as you wipe out legions of enemies. Just don't expect to be able to take more than a few hits.  While with the berzerker you go right up close and personal to the enemies attack quickly and annihilate them. The engineer plays more like a tank, with slow deliberate attacks and skills that allow you to summon helpers to attack enemies or to distract enemies from you. Finally, the Marksman focuses on hit and run from  a-far  with skills that allow for those types of tactics. Natually each of the characters has many skills to choose from that allow for alternate tactics. Unlike Diablo 3, or Path of Exile once you choose a skill, you have to pay to reroll the skills up to 3 previous skill points can be refunded.\n\n3 C: Loot/Equipment\nThe loot and equipment is quite similar to other games in the genre (IE diablo clones), with the standard tropes of rarity (IE normal, magic, rare and unique, and legendary) with increasing number of bonus' to stats depending on rarity. Each Class has two types of unique weaponry, however that doesn't mean you can't equip melee weapons on a mage or on a ranged character.\n\n4. Wrap up:\nI was excited for it because several former developers of diablo 2 were heading up this team. I have played a large amount of the game under VMware while I was waiting for the mac native version. and its safe to say that I've gotten my money, your money, and two other people's money's worth out of the game.The thing that REALLY sold it to me was the Mod Support.\n\n5: Mods!\nWell you've beaten the vanilla game, thats all well and good but are you ready for the REAL fun to begin? download the Synergies Mod. What does it do? Well for starters, it adds 3 new classes, that all feel  like they belong in the game nearly 700!! new pieces of equipment and weapons, new areas to explore, new enemy types, an end-game and raids. not to mention a rebalancing of the existing skills and classes. I would say that its got more content in it than most expansions's do. I cannot reccomend this mod enough. Unfortunately, there is a maximum of 10 mods per game. (this is gotten around by combining mods into 1 large mod pack) And you cannot play with those who do not have the same mods as you.\n\n6. Rating\n\nIn this rating system 5 is average,  which means its plenty good just nothing special, even slightly.\n\nNOTE the scores below are weighted against other games in the genre.\n\nStory: 3/10 There is a story, it ends and has no plot holes. But thats about it.\nGraphics: 5/10 While its not super fancy and flashy like its bigger budget siblings, the art direction is pretty good and ages well\nMechanics 7/10 Again, not as deep as bigger budget entries in the genre but still plenty of fun (and mod support really helps with this aspect)\nSound: 8/10 Matt Uleman (the composer of the dIablo 1 and 2 soundtrack) did the soundtrack for this game and you can hear echos of his earlier work, and its glorious.\nCombat: 5  out of 10 Its not great but it sure is quite a satisfying experience overall.\n","February 5, 2015","true","304.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Besides that, we can see a mix of: good visual style, large customization options, decent gameplay and decent multiplayer. I definetly recomend it, but i understand why some people dislike it: the core gameplay is just "click on monsters see them die" lol, and its really just a matter of "i like or i dislike that" .

It's probably not going to be comparable to Diablo 2, and it's not as deep as PoE for example, but otherwise it's a very polished game that does well in many areas. Compared to Torchlight 1, everything is better.\n\n+ Skill system is better and pretty much all skills have some use now, no more overlapping skills between classes.\n+ Areas are just better. Maps are larger and the smaller pieces that make them up are much more different and interesting. It's probably one of the game's greatest highlights. The minigames also add a lot to the randomness.\n+ Combat takes more effort than mashing 1 skill at the highest difficulty.\n+ Modding.\n\nIt has cons but honestly still feels very polished for the price that it doesn't really matter that much.","June 22, 2014","true","218.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I don't think I can really sit here and list all the "quality of life" improvements added for the sake of streamlined gameplay that doesn't insult the consumer's intelligence. This is a solid game that's going to be relevant for a long time, especially with Salan's Synergies Mod. Seriously, that guy is doing god's work, keeping people coming back for more.\nAnyway, Torchlight II is your traditional ARPG that brings a lot to the table compared to first installment. All while paralelling Diablo and Diablo II. The original heroes are present in cameos with new classes taking on the mantle in a larger setting across four chapters. Each said class breaks the mold compared to Diablo II with different ability combinations that can make for some interesting builds. Some more viable than others, but you'll rarely see an "I Win" build that dominates over all.\nThe pet is still present, allowing you to sell your junk and even pick up supplies for you to keep you focused on the action with minimal town visits. In fact, the pet is a bit more useful with its own equipment and fish you can use to transform it to other creatures, all with different stats and special attacks or simply buffs to compliment your strategy.\nThe settings are more vast this time, taking you across different continents, all with sidequests or hidden dungeons to explore.\nSocketing, gems, and skulls are still present. This time with a crafting system. You can of course merge like gems together for more powerful ones. But you can also mix/match them to generate random shards/gems with different ability sets within their theme. Plus you can do the same with items and gear, creating different rare armors/weapons, or stronger potions. Most of it is trial and error based, but part of the fun is the expiremntation.\nStats and skills are thankfully spelled out in a detailed tooltip. You know what to expect from what you invest in almost down to the modifier that dictates is effectiveness. No more guessing on what stats or gear is essential, but it doesn't hold your hand either as you can play around with what primary stat you want to focus on as a modifier. Vitality is a bit useless if you're not a shield user, sadly, but socketing makes up for it.\nCombat is fluid, satisfying, and an excellent sense of impact. Whether you're laying waste to everything in your path with spells, sniping things from a range, swinging a giant weapon, or quickly shredding everything one by one with blinding speed, there's a sense of satisfaction to what you're doing and different gauges for each class to reward you for your relentlessness.\nOnline gameplay is going to be hit or miss at this point. The net code is solid, but with modding and vanilla sepparated, it splits the community down the middle. At least from my point of view since I did multiplayer pre-GUTS. Now, you might have trouble finding people online, depending on your time zone. Good thing there's an offline mode too. (Obligatory jab at Diablo III)\n\nI highly reccomend Torchlight II. Not only to ARPG fans, but anyone curious about the genre as it's a great place to start. Play alone, play with friends, or make new friends while playing. More than worth the full price easily. Mod it until it crashes.","March 15","true","811.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you like any of the Diablo games, then chances are you're going to like this game. It's simple enough, really...four classes to choose from, a good array of skills that you can put points into, and the ability to use any weapon in the game, regardless of your class. I think the best part about this game is you can - technically - build yourself how you want, and still have a class that works well even in increased difficulties. Only real problem is that the increased difficulty doesn't net you any rewards. It's just harder. No increased loot drops, nothin'. Heck, you actually get *less* experience points per kill, and everything is made to be more expensive, while you meanwhile get less gold per drop. There's some "meh" things about this game, but...largely? I enjoy it.

But you can also mix/match them to generate random shards/gems with different ability sets within their theme. Plus you can do the same with items and gear, creating different rare armors/weapons, or stronger potions. Most of it is trial and error based, but part of the fun is the expiremntation.\nStats and skills are thankfully spelled out in a detailed tooltip. You know what to expect from what you invest in almost down to the modifier that dictates is effectiveness. No more guessing on what stats or gear is essential, but it doesn't hold your hand either as you can play around with what primary stat you want to focus on as a modifier. Vitality is a bit useless if you're not a shield user, sadly, but socketing makes up for it.\nCombat is fluid, satisfying, and an excellent sense of impact. Whether you're laying waste to everything in your path with spells, sniping things from a range, swinging a giant weapon, or quickly shredding everything one by one with blinding speed, there's a sense of satisfaction to what you're doing and different gauges for each class to reward you for your relentlessness.\nOnline gameplay is going to be hit or miss at this point. The net code is solid, but with modding and vanilla sepparated, it splits the community down the middle. At least from my point of view since I did multiplayer pre-GUTS. Now, you might have trouble finding people online, depending on your time zone. Good thing there's an offline mode too. (Obligatory jab at Diablo III)\n\nI highly reccomend Torchlight II. Not only to ARPG fans, but anyone curious about the genre as it's a great place to start. Play alone, play with friends, or make new friends while playing. More than worth the full price easily. Mod it until it crashes.","March 15","true","811.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The combat feels fast and makes you feel like a god........or like a fool when you get a stumble attack.\nThe story is also quite nice, it sort of copys Diablo 2 and 3, but to me that doesn't matter, the way its told matters. The artistic, hand drawn pictures for the cutscenes suit the cartoonish graphics. The world that I always wondered about is also fully realised in this 2nd installment of Runics games. The quest's aren't as grindy and the quest's that were from the portal guy from Torchligh 1, gone. I reaaally didn't at all like those, it was just grindy whilst the quest's this time are fun and have a story. They also kept the reputation mechanic. All in all a great game, a must buy for avid RPG lovers.\n\nIt's been a year or more since I wrote the original review, and I think it's time for an update.\nThis game is still spendlid, but I have a slightly more varied view on Torchlight 2 than I did before.\nThe vanilla game is something I definetly appreciate far more now after playing with mods for 30-40 hours, and switching back.\n\nThis game has several mechanics which make it stand out for me. Things like the reputation system make it easier to upgrade your skills quicker without making you overpowered and consequently beating the mobs easily.\nIt also has some of the most satisfying combat I have ever seen in a game. I have not seen or played Diablo 3, but this makes me feel pretty happy as I slaughter dozens of zombies or whatever.\nThe effects of the weapons, abilities and armour are well made, and most are randomly generated but manage to be intersting and be genuinely nice to find.\nThe levels are relatively different and varied, and have a large selection of different enemies, abilities and focuses with good art design.\n\nJust buy it whilst it is on sale!","November 27, 2012","true","125.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has an endearing art-style that's easy on the eyes, and the gameplay is addictive enough to keep you playing 'till the end (I played about 50 hours by the time I beat it). However, there is nothing about this game that is exceptional or raises the bar. The story isn't deep or engaging, and the world lacks depth. Had the developers expanded the towns and added sub characters to strengthen the plot, then this game could have been a bench mark. The loot drops are well-balanced and look decent, the world is visually appealing, even interesting in some places, and the monsters are well-designed. But beyond the relentless grind, there's nothing much motivating you to keep collecting and throwing away loot 'till the next boss fight, except more loot and boss fights, that is. If you're just looking for a game to help you pass the time without being bored, then it does its job well, but don't expect an engaging story to justify the 50+ hours you may waste playing it. In the end, I feel like I got my money's worth, but only based on what I already kind of expected.","June 1, 2015","true","64.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Runic Games realises it's nice to also package in an actual game with your Excel sheet, and manages to build an inviting world with a responsive and satisfying combat system.\n\nThe game's story is one of tragic desperation, told across 4 acts, and while I won't spoil anything I suggest you not play this for its storyline, as it doesn't go far nor deep. Don't mistake this for a lack of charm though, as each of the game's environments are colourful and varied. From bright shining deserts to gloomy forests and snowy ... cold places. My eyes were never bored.\n\nThe four classes available in the game all have their distinctive styles, but also allow for a large amount of customisation on the player's part. Many different active abilities are available to choose from, which translates to many different ways to play. Within the admittedly limited amount of classes I can almost guarantee anyone will find a build they're comfortable with. A minor point against this is that respeccing is not available in the base game. Modding rectifies this.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point: The players. This game has an abundance of that whole consumer-friendliness our industry seems to relish in not caring about. You want mod support? It's in there, ranging from the smallest of tweaks to total conversions. Always online DRM? Don't be so daft, play offline if you like and have a lovely experience. What about LAN? Yeah, LAN support is in, go nuts. Also note the apparent lack of any microtransactions or locked-behind-paywalls DLC. The point I'm trying to make is that if you take the direction of the industry into account when you're considering a purchase, this is definitely not the worst option available.\n\nLastly, I should point you to its price. This game doesn't exactly break the bank compared to most other releases of this scope. HowLongToBeat.com lists the average main story completion takes around 20 hours, that's not counting the side quests in the field, extra dungeons, mapworks (endgame dungeons) or New Game Plus mode.\n\nSo what have we got? A 20ish hour flat story with a pleasing coat of paint, well flowing and varied options for combat, single- online- and LAN play and excellent mod support packed into what is a relatively inexpensive game. If your interest has been piqued I highly recommend you play this game, but if you’re on the fence I suggest having a go with the free demo first.","February 22, 2015","true","57.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

I would say this would be the poor-man's version of Diablo III, but the truth of the matter is Torchlight II holds it's ground and could even be considered a better game overall, depending on what you're looking for.\n\nTorchlight II brings better loot, better progressions system, mob variety and arguably a better 'end-game'. The only two thing it lacks, compared to Diablo III, is the graphical fidelity (although since the game is done in a cartoonish art-style, it is not immediately noticable) and story.\n\nWhile Torchlight II manages to win points in the atmosphere department, the story of the Diablo universe offers a much more expanded lore and world to explore. Voice acting, cinematics and sound design are far better than what Torchlight II has. Which is to be expected from a series that started it's roots in indie gaming.\n\nExperience sharing in multiplayer could use some tweaking, but loot is instanced for every player and trading is fully functional for all items you find. A big plus for the game is also mod support, something which Diablo III lacks. The Steam Workshop is sure to increase the life-span of the game, and enchance the experience according to your taste buds.\n\nDespite some of it's shortcomings, it is still one of the better hack 'n slash RPGs out there. Definitely worth your time!","March 13, 2015","true","81.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Rather, I would pen it down for those few like me who usually hate top down. Well, I love action RPGs - fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas and Skyrim are the among the best single player experiences I can remember. But when it comes to top down, I just used to have a scorn for the genre.\nI tried diablo 3, torchlight and torchlight 2 (a torchlight fan) at a friend's house long back. I hated it and never looked towards it for months to come. It is accidentally that I had some $4.00 in my wallet and TL2 was on sale that I purchased it. I wanted to try it again, even though I was 99% sure it won't appeal me.\n\nI was wrong. The game is GREAT. But to realize its greatness, there are three things you must keep in mind:\n- Don't think that you are playing an action game. There is very little skill of swiftness on mouse and keyboard required in this game. So, definitely not an action game.\n- Play it for at least 15 hours, level up to level 25 and then judge.... things keep on adding, new skills start appearing, interesting scrolls begin dropping out of chests and skilled monsters... it is then that you understand how amazing this game is.\n- If you are dying more, it is not that you are not able to deliver enough clicks-per-second, it just means that each of the clicks has an ignorantly cascaded set of skills behind it. So, activate the right skills and wear the right armor. I started learning new things about the mechanics when I was 3 hours into the game and am learning totally new things till now (e.g. For torchlight 2 players - sets of armor... the purple thing written in some armor's description... something I learnt at mty 29th hour).\n\nI played the game for 15 hours on normal, realized that I was very ignorant about the game's mechanics, deleted my character, started a veteran character and adorned it with better perks this time... continuing with it.... glad that I started the game again..\n\nHAPPY GAMING!","March 2, 2015","true","34.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Colorful and vivid visuals mesh with professional sound quality and gameplay design features. I have put plenty of time and effort into the game and can easily recommend it to gamers looking for a 'classical' experience.\n\nTorchlight II is an action role-playing game not unlike the Diablo franchise. Immerse yourself in a fantasy world rife with conflict and unique people, places, and ideas. Play one of four classes and then embark on a journey to customize your character even further with three skill trees for each of the archetypes. Bring friends along, tackle procedurally generated dungeons, and advance in the engaging storyline as a casual gamer or passionate 'min-maxer'.\n\nTorchlight II is an exceptional game that can keep you occupied for hours, if not days.... perhaps weeks!","January 27","true","125.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Unless you've absolutely hated every hack-n-slash action-rpg from Diablo to Titan Quest, you owe it to yourself to buy this game.\n\nWhile Diablo 3 tried to reinvent the genre with World of Warcraft design philosophies, Torchlight 2 takes an entirely different approach; They have taken all of the elements people loved about previous games in the genre, such as character building, generous piles of loot, and fast action-packed gameplay, perfected those elements and expanded upon them. The result is a true spiritual successor to the games many of us sank countless hours into.\n\nStrapped for cash? It's only $20. Lousy internet? There's Offline and LAN play. Crummy computer? It's so well optimized, you could run it on a laptop. Anything you don't like about the game? It FULLY supports modding and the steam workshop.","September 14, 2012","true","110.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I'm not saying that Blizzard failed to deliver good game, but this one is just as much Diablo-like as you can get. Everything from music to combat mechanics just feel like Diablo. Well, music on its own is beast. You can hear same tones as in diablo I & II. Game itself is quite long and has huge replayability, but combined with full mod support it's nearly unlimited. I recommand using Synergies mode as it makes game a lot more difficult as well as adding many new enemies, locations, items, very hard raids and recreates some of existing classes as well as adds some new. In fact only bad thing in TL2 is that it's not really hard, even on highest difficulty it's bit easier than Diablo II. 11/10, would buy again.","July 19, 2015","true","104.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It gives you a world you'll want to explore, filled with enemies you'll love to destroy."\n\n- Kotaku\n\n"Torchlight is a vibrant, fun, steampunky world, and exploring it is an absolutely addictive pleasure."\n\n4.5/5 - Joystiq\n\n"Not to be missed by anyone who considers themselves a fan of the proud tradition of action RPGs"\n\n5/5 - Gamespy\n\n"With most games of this caliber retail at $60, it might sound ludicrous that Torchlight 2 only costs $20 – because it is."\n\n9/10 - Machinima\n\n"Grab the game, grab some friends, and get to clicking."\n\n9/10 - Destructoid\n\nSteam Workshop\n\n\nTorchlight 2 now fully supports Steam Workshop. A new launcher synchronizes any mods you have subscribed to, and lets you customize their activation state and loading priority. In addition, when playing Internet games in the lobby, you will be able to filter modded games by mod combination, and with a single button click, subscribe to those mods. Torchlight 2 will then restart, synchronize them, and activate them before returning you to the game.\n\nWhen playing modded games, you can view your mod history, any previously played mods, and the impact disabling mods may have on your character.\n\nWe've tried to make the process as seamless as possible, with a focus on allowing modded multiplayer games with a minimum of fuss.\n\nGUTS\nGUTS is our in-house development tool, now fully integrated with Steam Workshop. You can publish directly to Steam Workshop when you compile your mod, making it available immediately for others to play.\n\nWe've also added a special tool to GUTS designed to convert pre-GUTS mods into the official mod format, with an eye toward making the transition much easier for our ambitious early modders.\n\nYou can learn more about using GUTS here.\n\nNew Content\nThis release also includes new game content!\n\nThe NetherRealm tileset - new NetherRealm dungeons can be found via portals throughout the world\nNew Monsters\nNew armor sets\nNew weapons\nNew pets - including the Headcrab!\nNew endgame map content\nSome additional new dungeons in New Game plus modes in large overworld areas\nREAD MORE\nAbout This Game\nThe award-winning action RPG is back, bigger and better than ever!

With immersive game play and endless character customisations Torchlight II is highly addictive.  As many other reviews have mentioned, if you are a lover of Diablo II then give this game a shot.\n\nMy favourite feature in Torchlight is the unique pet system; you chose from a wide selection of strong companions with customisable gears and skills.  These companions are very functional and an important support tool.  They can be fed different food (that you fish yourself from ponds discovered throughout the game) which morph your pet into different creatures that provide various stat bonuses for a limited period of time.\n\nWell made, no problems at all with bugs etc.","January 10, 2014","true","39.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While the story and composition are almost exactly identical to D2, there are a few changes that I absolutely loved. I found the skills very approachable, you can make your build as simple or as complex as you want, and most builds are effective. You can no longer upgrade gems the same way, so you don't need to feel compelled to collect and keep all the gems. They added a limited ability to respec your character, so you have a few levels to play around with skill choices, which I found useful. However, the most notable change (for me) is the independent treasure drops. There is no longer a mad scramble for the best loot if you play multiplayer. You can take all the loot you see, which made multiplayer infinitely more enjoyable for me.","January 6, 2015","true","64.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game's single player is fun so throw in three buddies (Seven friends with a mod) and it's a blast a little hectic but still alot of fun.\n+ Accessable difficulty: I personally hate games being overly difficult that's just my personal opinion, I don't play games to be frustrated I play games to have fun so I was quite pleased when I found out that Torchlight has multiple difficulties ranging all the way from easy to rediculous there's something for everyone.\n+ System requirements: PC has a TON of great games, running all of them is a different story and the variety of great games with low system requirements grows smaller by the day it's nice that a game that is as much fun as Torchlight is can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone with a PC.\n+ Mods: Since it's release Steam has opened the Steam Workshop to it which has infinitely expanded it's gameplay it's options at this point are rather limitless.\n\n- Visually messy multiplayer: I personally don't have this problem but I've read about people complaining that multiplayer becomes visually 'messy' with multiple players so it's something to keep in mind if you're buying this to play with other people.\n- Sometimes loot drops feel slightly disproportionate: Sometimes it feels like loot drops from average enemies are just as lucrative as boss loot drops.\n- Story is pretty weak: Not that Torchlight is known for it's outstanding story but yeah it's pretty weak here.\n\nTorchlight is a wonderful bargain and overall an enjoyable experience that I suggest everyone try at least once.\n\n8.5/10\n\nReasonable Price Point: This game has been a bargain since day one and it has a wonderful development team I would say at least $30 USD.","November 25, 2013","true","117.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While the story and composition are almost exactly identical to D2, there are a few changes that I absolutely loved. I found the skills very approachable, you can make your build as simple or as complex as you want, and most builds are effective. You can no longer upgrade gems the same way, so you don't need to feel compelled to collect and keep all the gems. They added a limited ability to respec your character, so you have a few levels to play around with skill choices, which I found useful. However, the most notable change (for me) is the independent treasure drops. There is no longer a mad scramble for the best loot if you play multiplayer. You can take all the loot you see, which made multiplayer infinitely more enjoyable for me.","January 6, 2015","true","64.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In general, you can't simply spam click to clear mobs, the game pushes you to dodge abilities, manage your mana pool and react to different scenarios (use abilities to trap big guys, use your escape ability to..well escape,etc).\n\nCons:\n-The story is bad, this is definietly not the game to play for its story. To be honest, I stopped caring about the story very early on.\n-Can get a bit repetitive.\n-Okay character custimization (character creation allows you to play very little with your character's features).\n\n8/10, great game to pick up when it goes on sale.","January 5, 2015","true","52.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The shared stash is a great tool to send good armor from your higher level avatars to your lower level ones, and between the staches and the player and pet inventories, you have ample room to store things.

Without a doubt it was the best money ive ever spent on a title such as this, and 20 bucks is the best deal you could possibly get.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you love gameplay like the Diablo-esque franchise. Even Path of Exile doesnt quite measure up to this, in my opinion, but thats more because PoE plays differently.","January 20, 2015","true","17.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I wouldn't say it's simpler than the likes of Diablo or Path of Exile, but it is easier to manage. The art style is a bit more cartooney, but in a very good way. Very detailed landscape, diverse items, and intriuging story if you choose to pay attention to it. My favorite part about this game has to be the pet system. You have a battle companion with its own gear, its own inventory, and the ability to recall to town to clear up some inventory space and bring you any basic goods (potions,scrolls, or dynamite) from the store. Makes it much easier to full clear dungeons without having to waste time towning.\n\nI haven't even delved into the multi-player yet, and I'm only on act II of my first character. But this game is already becoming a favorite.\n\nFor fans of hack & slash, it's a must-have. For fans of RPG it's a must-have. For fans of loot it's a must-have. For fans of fun, it's most definitely a must-have.\n\n10/10","March 11, 2015","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azelyra/recommended/200710/","Azelyra","Kirishima Sakura desu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azelyra/","73 products in account","So, Torchlight II is the continuation of the Torchlight series released back in 2009 by Runic Games. This game is a sequel to the first Torchlight game made.\n\nPlot: The story is pretty simple and easy to follow, it was pretty memorable, it had memorable boss fights and references to other games that they put in such as Vyrax's tower and the Dragon Shrine, which is a huge reference to The Elder's Scrolls IV: Skyrim. The game in my opinion is quite entertaining, although it could be a little too short for some hardcore RPG players as looking at other games for example the Diablo series and so, but personally I also agree that the story itself is a little too short, even though there are things that allowed you to just continue playing this game over and over again.\n\nGameplay and Multiplayer: With multiplayer added to the Torchlight universe, compared to the first game that didn't have any elements of multiplayer, really did open up new windows for people to really play this game. Also with the addition of the games being moldable, multiplayer has been as fun as ever since it is also a drop-in/drop-out type which does not affect the storyline whatsoever, but with more players in the game the hostile enemies will get a little tougher which could be hard for some people, but in general it does not affect the single player gameplay at all.\n\nVisuals: One word-- "Polished". The game looks great and really amazing. It was detailed, beautiful and fun to look at even if they were cartoonish and not as realistic as many of the games out there, they are really well done. As for the cut-scenes, they still hold back the elements from Torchlight 1, which retained the uniqueness and credibility of Torchlight, which I believe this game is perfect for most audiences that enjoy games that maybe aren't too realistic.\n\nAudio: The OST is made by Matt Uelmen, the composer and sound designer of the Diablo series, also joined with Max Schaefer, the same people who made the music for the first Torchlight game. Although the soundtrack really differs in theme from the soundtrack of the Diablo series, they did a really amazing job of implementing the country music themes which gave it a distinctly different sound from the "Tristram" them of Diablo which made it great. They also did an amazing job in this part as they recorded over 200 live takes using a twelve string guitar alongside with many other instruments. The voice acting in this game casted many veteran voice actress and actors such as Lani Minella and so on who performed many of the voices in-game.\n\nReception: This game scored slightly more than the original Torchlight, which most of the reviews received were very favorable. On review sites such as Metacritics, this game attained an overall score of 88 out of 100 based on many reviews from 65 professional gaming critics worldwide which is an amazing score. Would you buy this game? Many RPG players would probably think that this game will just be like the first Torchlight and therefore result in a quick 'hiatus' from playing the game due to the repetitive nature of the game, however this is different. The developers themselves released tools for the players to be able to mod the game as they please, and people who join any multiplayer servers with mods on them will be able to access the mods freely, which leaves the game always moldable and playable in its own unique manners all the time.","January 2, 2013","true","117.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Not only are there different difficulties and online, a massive selection of pets, multiplayer servers that host up to six players at a time, but the story line and characters are highly interesting.\nThere are four classes to choose from, a mage, an engineer, a gun-slinger, and the classic bezerker. Each has their own special trait that makes each unique and desirable to different types of players. Choosing a class doesn't limit you to their stereotypical equipment, though! Being a dual axe-weilding Embermage and being questioned about  why  I use axes instead of a staff or wand is just a portion of the fun!\nI am what I presume to be about one-third of the way through the game judging by level and achievement progress, though I intend to continue playing after I complete the game with my current character. Perhaps the biggest problem I'm facing is my pet hawk being so much more powerful than me. then again, I suppose I am the one that taught it such powerful spells and provided stat-boosting equipment in the form of a collar and tags.\nOne of my most recent side quests had me help a man recover masks in an attempt to bring peace to two warring races, and though I won't spoil all the details, it was a perfect, "Plot twist!!!" moment that had me grin and facepalm at my want to help (And need for xp!)  He turned out to be evil and needed the masks to gain power. Whoopsies! Was fun defeating him though~\n\nOverall, I would suggest this game to anyone that enjoys RPG-style games that finds others hard to run due to system requirements. The minor issues I experience are not enough to subtract from the experience and pleasure of this game.

But it's what you expect from a genre like this, so i'm not complaining. The pet system was excellent, as it saves me the trouble from having to run back and forward to the nearest town.

Why?\n\n- Casual gamer Friendly!\n\n- Although there is, what may seem at first, a limited number of classes the skill selection makes for at least 3 or 4 different sub-variations for each class. Replay value is great, although leveling is a test of patience. Capping taking roughly 2 complete playthroughs.\n\n- Graphics are not as hard on the average CPU that us mortals can afford. I prefer stylized graphics over realistic graphics because they are never out of style or look dated like most other 3D games.\n\n- It offers an Endgame consisting of Mapworks, a tool that allows you to run random dungeons of a level of your choosing (up to 105), and Tarroch's Tomb, a relentless 10 wave gauntlet that drops loot every wave you beat but disappears if you die (Wave 1 comprised of lvl 100 enemies and wave 10 of lvl 199 enemies).\n\n- The loot system actually feels FAIR!!! *coughs* Diablo III *coughs*\n\n- Moddability adds heaps to the game including a difficulty increase and class changes that increase replay value. Downside is modded game saves are different than stock and you can only play with people that have the same mods. Items can not be crossed from modded to unmodded.\n\n- If you get bored or just want to test limits you can duplicate items for money or utility by using a stash and save file manuever. You could also use console to spawn items but you will be labeled as a cheater. The ability to do these cheats adds a lot to the experienced of a gamer that is NOT HARDCORE. Casual gamers need to be catered to too.\n\nThe only real downside I found was the relentlessness when making ability choices.\nMARK MY WORDS: You cannot respec more than the last 3 abilities you leveled or chose. This means you must level up a character from scratch to try a different build and will probably have to make 2 almost identical characters to fix a stupid choice mistake you made on your first try at a class. Some people love this feature but I believe it would be better if you could just have 2 sub-class slots like you have in WoW or if you could get an option to reset points after completing the game. Just my 2 cents.\n\nPlease buy this and enjoy.","June 25, 2014","true","95.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

From having an overworld, to all the classes being balanced toward each other's weaknesses, to the goal of the game being to slay the evil incarnation of the protagonist of the previous game. And my god is it awesome.\n\nLet me be blunt and say that this game's marketing strategy was amazing. The developer basically had to do next to nothing to market the game, since it was entirely carried by the fact it addresses basically every complaint people had with Diablo 3 in one fell swoop. It has no always on DRM, it has mods, local access network multiplayer and online and the list just goes on and on. It's a complete game from start to finish and like every Diablo-esque game, you're a sociopathic hero who simply just carves through entire armies worth of enemies like a hot knife through butter.\n\nThis is by far one of the greatest sequels I've ever played.","September 29, 2012","true","14.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Immersion never feels forced in Torchlight 2!\nYou'll find yourself playing this game to realise your characters maximum potential for your chosen style of play/build, and then putting it to the test. Personally I get a giggle every time I send my pet to to town to sell the crap I've laden  it's bag with, such a great feature that, which means you can get on with your killing (if you dare going alone!).\nAnd when you're done, you can get content from the Steam Workshop to extend your game play, and even add 3+ more classes, more dungeons, and even raids! Hell, if you're into content creation and a little know-how, you can get the GUTS tool and make your own!\n\nOnce you're set up to play on-line you can play your game either on LAN or Internet, and your friends can join you in your adventure, and trade goodies to each other!\n\nThere is a small hassle setting up an on-line account and linking it to your steam account on the game website, and then add friends so you can play on-line with them. It's nothing hard, but I've heard the picky few complain xD.\nIf you're playing in Mod Mode (Steam workshop addons), you have to make sure your friends are running the same ones, in order to play together, otherwise it's pretty straightforward :D\n\nPersonal Rating: Great Game, worthy of any library\nScore Rating: 92% - Nearly a Classic!","January 23, 2014","true","191.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Really fun, easy learning curve, and nice graphics. The downside, however, is that there is a lack of story.. so if you're playing games for story, I would not recommend this.\n\n10/10 would definitely play again!","June 20, 2015","true","21.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
