"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/80340/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1198 products in account","Blackwell Unbound is the second installment of Blackwell series, and it is a prequel to the first game. Here, we take the chance of experiencing the previous generation of the Legacy, with Lauren Blackwell. I have to say that the previous game left me with such great expectations, I rushed to play this one and first, was quite confused not the find Rosa. The city, the time, even Joey's attitude was different. Then I realized that finding Lauren instead, was a welcoming surprise in the end.\n\nIn this game we play as Lauren Blackwell, Rosa's witty and daring aunt back in 1970s. She is a chain smoker, a lady with an attitude and she has the guts that Rosa lacked in the previous game. She takes the day as it comes, and doesn't rest until a case is closed. Alongside Joey - the famous legacy himself - they investigate many potential cases and guide restless spirits to their after lives. In this specific period of their partnership however, they shall meet a strange old lady and end up witnessing a darker shade of what being a medium actually means.\n\nThis game is a bit grim in tone compared to the Blackwell Legacy. Dialogues carry sharp, two sided meanings, heavy with bittersweet feelings and a burdening suspense. The nature of the cases, and their resulting situation reveals a darker, shadier side to the medium business. Since we already know how Lauren's story will end eventually, seeing her venturing further down into her end is somehow heartbreaking.\n\nLauren is a strong character, as I briefly described before. She is so driven and so courageous, she ends up being downright suicidal sometimes. Her relationship with Joey is completely different whence compared to Rosa's relationship. We experience the advantage that Lauren and Joey already knew each other for a long time. So there is no awkwardness in their relationship. There is no "Oh no, ghosts are real?" period. I wondered if there would even be a little romance between them! I personally think this was a great opportunity to discover further background and in-depth personality to Joey and Lauren Blackwell.\n\nThe gameplay is nearly the same as before, yet the loveliest addition to the game is that Joey has become a playable character now. You are welcome to send him through walls or use his perception to check on the environment to catch a small nuance that may help you to progress in the case. I have to add that the voice acting was remarkably improved compared to the first game also. Alongside the commentary feature which we are already familiar with, you can enjoy some backdrop jokes, concept arts and various unused recordings when you finish the game.\n\nAll in all, I liked this one and now I feel more attracted to the Blackwell series altogether, witnessing Lauren and Joey in their time. Whence you look up on a family tree and compare the generations, it is not possible not to connect yourself better with given history. I cannot wait to play the third part and see what Rosa has been up to!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","August 17, 2015","true","5.0"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","25","28","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/80340/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Perhaps The Blackwell Unbound’s biggest contribution to the series, is giving it a far larger scope and nuance than what was only hinted at in the first game.Long before Rosa Blackwell ever met Joey Mallone (or had even been born for that matter), Unbound follows her aunt, Lauren, Joey’s previous “hostage” and an experienced medium at the point we find her. Unbound isn’t so much about her adventures with Joey though, as it is a foreshadowing of what we already know happens to her.\n\nIn many ways she’s the spitting image of her niece, though certainly more confident and assertive than the depressed Rosa we met in Legacy, yet tied by the common thread of having largely given up on the world. Lauren has devoted herself to helping lingering ghosts move on to the afterlife, but otherwise is unsure for what purpose she’s living for. Or at least that’s what she tells herself, but when caught up in an investigation she becomes a wholly different person.\n\nLauren is persistent and dedicated to doing whatever is necessary to finish a case, no matter if it means pressing people for information they’d rather forget, or putting her life on the line to catch a killer. Maybe it’s because she feels she has no other purpose that she’s able to so readily move forward, unafraid of how dangerous it could become. By abandoning her worry she’s able to fully embody her role as a medium, as if she too was a ghost and nothing could harm her. She’s a refreshingly capable heroine in a landscape of unstable sex objects, who manages to be tough without losing her humanity. There’s the feeling she’s still scared underneath her fearless exterior, and allows herself to become vulnerable at times to avoid a complete breakdown, but she’s always in control of any situation she puts herself in whether interrogating a witness or firing back when Joey gets brash.\n\nIt’s in the final moments of Unbound though that are the most affecting. We’ve already been told what eventually happens to Lauren in Legacy, but it’s seeing it and hearing Joey’s ignorant condolences that made me almost angry at what his presence has done and continues to do to the Blackwells. It casts Lauren and Rosa’s relationship with him in a different light and made me question his every word, now unsure if I could trust him the way I was, wondering if he had a more nefarious purpose for being there all along. Much of Unbound feels inessential, like another episode in a show you enjoy but could afford to miss, but its implications on the larger whole of the Blackwell saga is perhaps the most significant bit of exposition in the series thus far. Suddenly things have become a hell of a lot more complicated.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 22, 2015","true","2.8"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MakoSipper/recommended/80340/","MakoSipper","MakoSipper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MakoSipper/","3807 products in account","Short Verdict: Blackwell Unbound is the second installment in my favorite point-and-click adventure series in this century. The Blackwell series definitely has a special place in my heart. BU tells the story of Lauren Blackwell, a medium, and Joey, a spirit stuck with the Blackwell family, and they both go about solving mysteries in the 70's, if I'm not mistaken, and investigating cases related to ghosts who have problems moving on to the afterlife. It's definitely better than The Blackwell Legacy, but the sequels are even better. It's really fun and brings you back to old-school adventure games, while still bringing fresh elements to the table. If you're into classic point-and-click games, you most definitely have to try it! I had played it a few years ago and it was still fun to replay it now. Don't forget to play The Blackwell Legacy first! While you could play BU as a standalone game, you'll miss a little bit if you haven't played TBL.\n\nPros:\nDespite having ghosts and all, characters are very realistic, well-developed, deep, interesting, funny, and loveable\nThe story is interesting and solving the mysteries is really fun\nThe puzzles are kept to a sober level of difficulty, but there's no handholding, either\nThe dialogues and the voice acting are really outstanding, I can't stress it enough. And this game has no problems with different volumes like its prequel.\nHas a very interesting mechanic in which you combine clues instead of items to solve puzzles, and that works really well with the investigation theme\nThis time you get to control both Lauren and Joey, adding a lot to the puzzles\nBeautiful retro graphics\nBGM is awesome, way better than the already good tunes from TBL\nCons:\nSometimes the audio played doesn't match the text written\nThe low resolution annoys me a bit (you can set it to 1280x960, though, but that option is hard to find)\nWhile the game itself is a lot more polished than its prequel, they didn't take the time to properly proofread the dialogues, especially the ones with a character named C.\nBought on: PC and Android Bundle 11 by Humble Bundle for an average of US$ 0.55 (roughly R$ 1,46). It's also totally worth its full price, which isn't high at all!","December 31, 2014","true","7.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

The game certainly took me by surprised and when I saw the next game in this saga, Blackwell Unbound, I didn’t want to play it as I thought it couldn’t live up to its standards. Well I simply caved in and installed the game. Once completed, this one moved me more than the first (Blackwell Legacy) with even better character development. There were also slightly more technical improvements however the puzzle elements were the same; that is wasn’t challenging enough and lack thereof.\n\nBlackwell Unbound takes place in 1973, meaning it served as a prequel to Legacy. The game assumes the player’s knowledge of the main character Joey and introduces a new one, Lauren. Lauren is the aunt for Rosa from Legacy and her demeanour is considerably different as Lauren is more confident in her abilities as a medium. Then again, it didn’t explain at all of how Lauren was introduced to Joey in the first place. Nevertheless it’s a refreshing outlook of Lauren’s more assertive personality considering she is a chain smoker from hell. I guess that’s the 70s for ya.\n\nThe gameplay is in the style of a point and click variety – that is you literally just do that, point at a hotspot like an item or person and it will interact. Right click the mouse for the character to analyse and left click to interact. There is some inventory management where only Lauren can access (as after all, Joey is a ghost) and the neat notebook feature is here again. What this feature does, once it gets an update prompt, you can join sentences together to form another. Yet to those who’d played Legacy, there’s a new feature where you get to control both Joey and Lauren individually. This is pretty neat considering some puzzles requires swapping between characters.\n\nSpeaking of which, there are only a handful of puzzles to solve yet thankfully, they are all logical so they are no mind-bending at all. For some, this maybe a put-off however the plotline and game’s pacing hits the spot as there’s momentum instead of having a difficult puzzle to bottleneck the tempo. Also the storyline is so well written with realistic problems that’s very welcoming. The general mood is sombre yet well fitted for the plotline.\n\nThankfully to enhance the sombre mood, the musical scores by Thomas Regin is nothing short but exceptional. All the scores are well suited for this game and has that jazz feel. Not overdone however very welcoming and professionally composed. It’s that good I purchased the soundtrack in iTunes for USD $10. Graphically it is powered by the Adventure Game Studio (AGS), graphic artist Erin Robinson made some alterations, mainly with the characters and done a wonderful job at it. They are all dressed up as if it was the 70s and there’s little to be said about pixel hunting. Yet the opening screen where is shows the Statue of Liberty overlooking the Manhattan skyline at night is lovely to see.\n\nIt’s pretty rare that an adventure game sucks me in as well as Unbound did. The game’s length, depending upon your detective skills I guess, could take around the five hours mark. However I really cannot let go of this game until completion as mentioned before, the game’s pacing and storytelling is simply fantastic. Granted there’s a couple of bugs where the written text and spoken words differ and at one occasion, the text is there however the voice is muted however, and thankfully so, didn’t ruin the game. There’s obvious love and care poured into this game and the game’s ending, as much as I did actually panic, feels like I need to perform a standing ovation! A definite must play.\n\n8 / 10","March 21","true","6.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Blackwell  captures the days of SCUMM/Lucasarts perfectly... all too perfectly with it's qwerks, dead-ends, glitches and clunky interface.

Ideal for nostalgia hounds and teens who like the supernatural.\n\nConclusion.\n7/10.

You play as Rosa's aunt and predecessor, Lauren. Game mechanics are pretty similar to Legacy, with the notebook still in use. You get to control both Lauren and Joey. Unbound features 2 cases to solve, and contains several easter eggs and some interesting Steam achievements.\n\nLikes    Story - More content here compared to Legacy.\nCharacters - At first I worried I wouldn't like a chain-smoking protagonist, but it all turned out fine. The spooks were also fairly interesting, especially the female one.\nSetting - This takes place in the '70s; the retro vibe was successfully conveyed.\nAbility to play as Joey - This gave the game some variation.\nMusic - You can never go wrong with smooth jazz. And a piano.\nGraphics - Like those classic old-school Sierra games; my type of nostalgia.\nVoice acting - Lauren does "jaded and bitter" really well. I really liked the female spook too.\nEaster eggs! - Just like the good ol' days. One involves a floating head!\nSteam achievements - I didn't bother getting them all, but if you do that'll glean you maybe an hour or more of gameplay.\nDislikes    Length - Still too short for my liking. Say 2 hours at most.\nToo few locations - You backtrack a lot and have to visit the same places over and over. There aren't many scenes to explore. It gets a bit tiresome after a while.\nA bit one-dimensional - I was hoping for a bit more intrigue plot-wise. Things are too straightforward and spelled too plainly for the player.\nSummaryUnbound for me was a definite improvement over Legacy in terms of game length and story breadth, and as you can see from above, there were many other things I liked about it. However the plot was all too clear-cut and lacked mystique and finesse, and game length left much to be desired. As a standalone game I would not pay more than US$2 for this.","April 9","true","7.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This one is actually a budget prequel, starring Rosa's auntie and jazzy setting of older New York.\n\nThe engine is quite old, but trusty and should work just fine, despite sometime being weird about using anti-aliasing over the pixel-art. Mostly when characters sprites are being scaled. It has a weird thing where all dialogue would be insta-skipped after pressing Shift+Tab, commonly used for Steam overlay. Pressing Tab will fix it.\n\nAs you can see, this game is a prequel, starring Lauern, Rosa's auntie along with Joey the sidekick ghost in older New York. And as you can actually see, it feels like a prequel with more of budget animation, the pixel-art isn't more simple and isn't as amazing. Still does job done. The odd thing that annoyes me is talking animation, for some reason everybody bobs whole head down upon opening mouth. The music is heavely using jazz in pretty much anything, which gives a special atmosphere to game's setting, but I like it less than in the first game.\n\nAnd yes, it's a modern point-n-click, with no deaths or dead ends. This time puzzles are a little better, though some notebook combinations don't make perfect sense. A good innovation is ability to switch between two character, though Joey doesn't have as much of use. Still makes it more like a team.\n\nThe plot starts dynamically right off the bad, unlike the first game where half of the game was you wandering around aimlessly. Here you got two seemingly unrelated cases. Yes, investigating in same time and deciding which clues belong to which one. Doesn't have big plot motivation to push you forward though. The plot also sets things going for the third game, so you shouldn't miss this game either.\nLauern is also more of mature character than Rosa, and the way that two main heroes interact with each other, with ability to chit chat, is quite fun. With unique part of being a heavy smoker.\n\nAchievements are quite usual, and there are two that are related to amount of times Lauren smoked through the game... So in one walkthrough you wil spend some time watching her picking on cigarrete and another one you better be speedrunning. Aha.\n\nAnd yes, game once again delivers on extra content. The commentaries mode is still there and this has drawing artist speaking sometimes too. Game designer's commentaries are there too and once again he mostly speaks about his experience with voice acting.\nAnd once you beat a game, while abusing people by doing photographs, you will unlock other extra content, including voice acting bloober and now also having a collection of early versions of music and even concept art for the third, upcoming by then, game in the series. No worries, pixel art is different in final version of the third game, will not spoil too hard.\n\nSo yes, another solid entry in the series. Sets things up for the third game and is good enough to be stand-alone. Favourite among fans and developers, despite being more of budget title. Check it out.","April 13, 2015","true","17.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Lauren and her spirit guide, Joey, have been working together for some time by the start of this game and so the introductions and surprise of the last game have been replaced with an easy rapport. The transition of protagonist could have been disruptive, but considering the previous game ends on the question of Lauren's life and career, the chance to learn more about her was a welcome one. By making a full game of the answer instead of gaining this information through flashback or exposition (either from lost letters or Joey himself), you get a chance to see Lauren and Joey really interact with one another. In fact, moments where Joey has to comfort Lauren or talk her through the problem at hand are a common mechanic used to pause and sort through a twisted, interconnected set of cases. This installment has everything the past one did: retro/pixel graphics, great writing backed by great voice acting, and puzzles that are engaging as well as logical. Most importantly, this installment builds the same need to learn more, to see where this is going, as the last one did. I'm not sure if I'm excited to actually play the next game (I did play this immediately after finishing Legacy), but I am eager to learn more about the Blackwells and their relationship with the spirit world.","May 3, 2015","true","7.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I don't want to say 'not recommended' as it's not actively bad, but it's not great either. So I'll just summarise a few of the pros and cons and hopefully that will help you decide whether this game is for you or not. As context, I played Blackwell Legacy immediately before I played this, and I started off liking that, but by the end of the second game I think some of the mechanics are wearing a little thin.\n\nPros\n- Music much better than Blackwell Legacy (which was pretty irritating and there seemed to be no option to turn it off)\n- Interesting enough story/concept\n- Characters OK-ish, writing OK-ish\n- Good to be able to swap between the main characters this time around\n- Good to have two cases to solve rather than one this time.\n\nCons\n- The game is too short for the price and quality. It's being sold on steam as five separate games, but really they are ,pre like episodes and probably should be billed as such\n- I did not enjoy the graphics. I am a loverof classic point and click games and I realise that's where they were going with the style, but to me it felt they went a little too far back in time. The graphics style just didn't seem to fit.\n- The vast majority of the game is walking back and forth to the same destinations to talk to the same people to see if you can ask them anything else that will incrementally advance the game. It feels pretty repetitive.\n- The voice acting and sound quality is terrible. Really terrible. You can hear breathing/distortion from their mics (something I've never before noticed in a game - apart from Blackwell legacy...) and the voices themselves for the most part are cringeworthy, to the point that it felt comedic when it wasn't supposed to. One of the characters almost sounded like the 'Drugs are bad, mmmkay' chap from South Park. There were a few terrible 'old lady' impressions. This game would be improved by not having any voice acting at all. (And it would fit more with the retro point and click vibe to have no in-game speech, so I'm honestly not sure why they included it)\n\nIn short, I don't honestly think this game is worth the money at full price, it's aleady short and a lot of the game feels like back-and-fort padding. You will probably only enjoy it if you are a die hard fan of the genre (like me!). There are other games which are much better value, all round brilliant point and clicks such as Time Gentlemen Please! or Deponia. If you can pick it up in a sale though it might be worth a look, for the story.\n\n\n","July 5, 2015","true","12.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I would recommend starting with "Blackwell Legacy", as that is the first game in the series and "Blackwell Unbound" is the second one.\n\nIn contrast to the first game you won't see any major flaws in game design in this one (like huge infodumps and the infamous first rather boring puzzle with the doorman). The plot pacing is a lot faster and the puzzles are a bit more interesting. However, the game length stays about the same, depends how quick you solve all the puzzles, as does the general gameplay. You still got your notebook and puzzles are mostly solved via dialogues and said notebook and rarely with items in your inventory.\n\nPersonally, this is my favourite game of the series. I thought the relationship between Lauren and Joey was much more interesting than the one between Rosa and Joey, the dialogues were really good and fleshed out the characters really well. Besides that, I REALLY loved that voice of Lauren <3.

I'm starting to like these games more and more. I gave the thumbs down to the first game Blackwell Legacy with a question mark, since it wasn't altogether that bad (see full review on my profile). I've come to realize that these games are not your typical point and click adventure. Let me explain. Most point and click adventure games (at least the ones I have played) are puzzle based. This game on the other hand is more dialog/clue based. There are a couple of puzzles in the game, but the game stays true to what it should be a murder mystery (Don't worry the game is not graphic at all, just a bunch of cartoon looking ghosts).\n\nI still give the first game about 6/10. The main reason being too much storyline setup, a couple of really annoying puzzles (the director apologized for these), and super short game. While not the best game, it accomplished something important. It is like the introduction to a very good book. You can not only see that the director learned from some of the mistakes made in this game to make Unbound much better. It also helped in being able to jump right into this one, as characters were already set up. If you want to play this game, it is important to play Blackwell Legacy (Hey, its short! Maybe that was a good thing). You can definitely put this on the buy list. Here are my Pro's and Con's.\n\nPro's: Great Storyline for three different characters. Lauren Blackwell and the ghost she helps. The character interaction between Lauren and Joey is very good, you'll love these two characters and their relationship. No ridiculous puzzles in this one. Some hard one's, but nothing way out in left field. And the game is also longer too. Most of the stuff that was good or bad from the last game was improved on.\n\nCon's: Art is still not the best, but that is the style. Although the music music in this game probably did a better job at setting the right mood, there just weren't really any toe tapping tunes that the first game had.\n\nI'm working on Blackwell Convergance right now and it is going good thus far.\n\nCheck out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!","August 25, 2014","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a point and click adventure, and sticks to the usual control scheme and playstyle of the genre.\n\nIn Blackwell Unbound, you play the aunt of the protagonist of Blackwell Legacy. Since this game sort of jumps in to the middle of a relationship between a medium and spirit guide, it is helpful to play the original game first to get some explanation on what is going on. With the help of Joey Malone, a ghost from the 1940's, you must solve mysteries and help lost ghosts find their way to the spirit world. It is a nice shake up of the usual detective story dynamic. While you still must look for clues and interrogate witnesses, you are doing so with the help of a ghost. You can switch from time to time between Lauren and Joey, the ghost, to help you advance. Certain things can only be done by Joey, such as moving through walls or talking to other ghosts in the real world.\n\nBlackwell Unbound runs a good bit shorter than The Blackwell Legacy. I really enjoyed the notebook functionality in the first game, but found it a little lacking in this one just due to the overall shortness of the game. This may be because while there is one overarching story, there are two distinct mysteries to solve. The first game just had one mystery that kind of led to another and so on, but the clues really built off each other and involved a lot more using the notebook to combine clues and interrogate witnesses.\n\nThe graphic style is pretty much unchanged from the first game. It is reminiscent of early 90's adventure games, which in my opinion have aged better than games from the late 90's and early 00's that begin using 3D. They look well enough, but they are really lacking in detail. It's ok to use that style, but I'd like to see it sharpened up a bit with some more detail added overall.\n\nThe voice acting is much improved, with only small complaints. The main character in particular sounds so much better. She sounds engaged in the story, while her predecessor sounded a little bored. Joey sounds the same, which is neither great nor bad. The main villain sounds pretty terrible in Blackwell Unbound. It really kind of removed me from the story. I think you will understand when you hear it.\n\nOverall, I actually enjoyed this more than Blackwell Legacy. While it was a little shorter, and I missed using the notebook as much as the original, I found the overall improvement of the story and voice acting won out. I really like this main character more, although I'm not expecting to see much more of her. I will definitely try out the next game in the series, and recommend you give this game a look.\n\nGrade: B+","September 10, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And yet, somehow, Blackwell Unbound pulls it off admirably, all while adding some well-considered features and enhancements to the formula of the previous game.\n\nTo be fair, the characters explored in Unbound aren't completely unrelated.  Returning (or pre-existing) from the previous entry is ghostly sidekick Joey Mallone, this time teamed up with Lauren Blackwell, aunt of the previous game's Rosangela Blackwell.  Much of Lauren's past was shrouded in mystery in the previous game, dialog hinting only vaguely at her life as a medium.  While this game doesn't give you all the answers, or even most of them, it does at least give you a pretty decent glimpse into her life before Rosa.\n\nThe interface in Unbound is much the same as it was before: your standard Adventure Game interface, but with the added twist of a Notes page that lets you review and combine clues and facts.  Unbound adds another, very welcome feature: the ability to control Joey directly.  Rather than being little more than an object you interact with to complete certain puzzles, you can now float around in Joey's (lack of) shoes.  This makes Joey feel much more like a partner, vital to completing certain puzzles even, rather than a floating bit of comedic relief.\n\nMost of this game seems like a huge step forward for the series, despite chronologically being a step backward.  The dialog, the interface, even the ambiance and tone of the game all feel a bit more well developed and thought out.  This is still a short game - episodic and all - but despite the brief time spent in the game's version of 1973 New York you are still left with a very clear image of the city... at least as the game's developer meant to portray it.\n\nTo be concise, Blackwell Unbound is a short-but-excellent example of the classic point-and-click Adventure game genre, and a worth sequel to the original Blackwell Legacy.  Despite the change in setting it does a good job of carrying the torch, so to speak, and provides an interesting plot complete with entertaining characters and clever-but-not-frustratingly-illogical puzzles.

Details are revealed throughout the five installments of the Blackwell series regarding the female members of the Blackwell family, how Joey came to be, what happened to Aunt Lauren to trap her in a comatose state, etc. Together, Rosa and Joey seek out and help tormented ghosts trapped in the physical world cross over to "the other side" throughout the series.\n\nIn BLACKWELL UNBOUND, the player is taken back to the 1970s.

However, it became so large that it became a game in its own right.\nNote: UNBOUND features a real person as a character. Namely, writer Joseph Mitchell of The New Yorker.\n\n\nTo enjoy the story at it's best, the games should be played in order of creation. 1st 'LEGACY' -- 2nd 'UNBOUND' which explores the events and time that Lauren Blackwell and Joey were working together in the 1970s (while Unbound turned out, unintentionally, to be a prequel to Legacy, it should be played after Legacy to not only help enlighten the player as to what happened in the first installment, but also gives the player clues as to what is coming in future installments) -- 3rd 'CONVERGENCE' which takes place about six months after the events in Legacy -- 4th 'DECEPTION' which takes place some time after Convergence -- and 5th 'EPIPHANY', which is the final installment in the Blackwell game series.","August 18, 2013","true","19.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you enjoyed the first game of this series, "The Blackwell Legacy", you'll find this one even more enjoyable. It has "better" design, comparing to the previous installment, of course. It serves as a prequel, and follows a part of Lauren Blackwell's life, Rosangela's aunt. The soundtrack is much more improved and I really love the addition of Jazz and what not. Just get the entire bundle on this series, you will not regret it. Voice acting is basically equal to the previous title, and I love some of the recorded voices (especially Joey Mallone's). Please keep in mind that if you are not a fan of the point&click genre and if you mind playing a game with low resolution and low quality (pixelated) graphics, then the Blackwell series is not or you. I mean, the whole of WadjetEye's are not for you. Cuddos for The Shivah's easter egg.

This episodic format restricts puzzle elements somewhat but it also removes the frustration that comes with most adventure games, especially the indie title where finding the solution to one puzzle requires you to explore a dozen or more maps for that elusive clue.\nThe overall quality of the game is a step up from Legacy, the writing and the dialogues are improved by quite a lot, and puzzle solving still requires finding clues and combining them instead of the classic use Item A on Item B type, unrealistic adventure game method.\nOverall this is a very good follow-up on a promising first game, paving the path for the future instalments.","July 15, 2014","true","5.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This proves useful, as Joey can do certain things as a ghost that Lauren cannot. Unbound also replaces the ability to research leads via computer with researching leads via phonebook/telephone. This new research method is actually very fun, and once you realize how it works, you'll enjoy using it every time.\n\nItem / Inventory Use: Definitely in there, and you'll definitely use items on environment and also combine items; however item/inventory use is relatively downplayed compared to a lot of other point-and-clicks.\n\nPuzzle Quality: Very good! Puzzles are sort of "L.A. Noir" in nature. You interview NPCs to acquire information on particular subjects, and the important information you find is jotted down in a notebook. You can then use the idea in your notebook like inventory items during interviews with other NPCs to pry for new information. You can also combine ideas in your notebook if you think there is a connection, which can create new ideas and generate new leads to investigate. There are also inventory type puzzles, but the interview puzzles are the main attraction.\n\nSolution Quality: Very good solutions to puzzles and solutions make perfect sense. (Just make sure you exhaust all dialogues!) I never felt like solutions were illogical or overwrought nonsense. It's safe to say that this game avoids the hugest problem that games in this genre usually have.\n\nStory/Characters: Very good! In fact, this point-and-click emphasizes these aspects the most, so if those are the most important thing to you in a point-and-click, then you don't wanna miss out on the Blackwell games.\n\nDialogue Quality: Very good! Lots of dialogue to explore, and the character dialogue is well-written, believable, and interesting.\n\nLength: Very short! Games in the Blackwell series are more like "episodes". You can take one down in one or two hours if you know your way around a point-and-click.\n\nVERDICT: As far as the point-and-click genre goes, you absolutely don't want to miss these---especially if story and characters are your favorite part.","May 2, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Having known very little about the series going in, I have to say I enjoyed it, while not being particularly overwhelmed by it.  Before tackling this second game, I did a little bit of reading on it.  The general gist I got was that most people felt this second game was inferior to the first, and that it might be a little to short or too slight in content.\n\nI could not disagree more.  Whereas the first game was a nice enjoyable story, I found this second one leaps and bounds superior.  I did not find it too short (and really, what does "too short" mean when you're only paying a few bucks for a game?).  And the ending was pretty darn clever from a plot standpoint.  Unlike the first game, there is a consistent tone to Unbound, helped tremendously by the excellent jazz-tinged music score.  Unbound takes place in the span of one night--and the everpresent night scenes coupled with the themes of loss and regret gives Unbound a wonderful sense of poetry, of sadness.  And considering that this is a low-resolution game in the graphical spirit of early LucasArts games, it's somewhat miraculous that such a tone could be achieved.\n\nAnother criticism I've come across (and also disagree with) is that the game doesn't "help you" enough in terms of the notebook feature.  Some people have gone really overboard and called the notebook "broken."  The complaint seems to center around the idea that you as a player in real life shouldn't have to make any logical deductions on your own, but rather have the game itself spell it all out for you in Lauren's notebook.  It's ironic.  On the one hand people complain that the game is too short, on the other, they don't seem to want to take the time to ponder puzzles or be stuck on them.  I think in this modern age some people don't remember that adventure games traditionally had "being stuck on a puzzle" time factored INTO their play time.  So when you'd read descriptions of old King's Quest games and they claim to have 30 hours of game time, that's assuming the players don't just read from a walkthrough like some digital version of paint by numbers.  You're kind of supposed to have to think over things and figure things out in adventure games.\n\nBesides, it's all rather moot.  I mostly found it pretty self-evident when the game wanted you to write down specific names that came up and look them up on your own.  The one (rather clever) puzzle, that I indeed was stuck on for a time, had to do with making observations about a photograph in Lauren's inventory.  I think some people honestly wanted the game to make this observation for the player and spell it out in Lauren's notebook without any intuitive thinking required..  But frankly, if the game had done such things, it would've robbed the player of so much of the point of experiences like this.\n\nIn Unbound there is a different protagonist than the rest of the Blackwell games.  And that proves to be a double-edged sword in a way, as I actually liked this character (Lauren) better than Rosa, the other lead.  I will say that it does make for some mixed feelings regarding Lauren given that she--SPOILER ALERT--apparently spends the last 25 years of her life a miserable vegetable in a mental hospital.  (That's what we learned about her in the first game.)  So the bittersweet ending of this has that extra edge to it.\n\nI'm curious if the subsequent games ever bring some kind of satisfying resolution--impossible as it may seem--to Lauren's fate.\n\nSo to sum up:  Blackwell Unbound is a great throwback to point and click, low-resolution, plot-centric adventure gaming.  And frankly, given the strength of its writing and the richness of tone (again, gotta love that jazz), in many ways it's better than a lot of the games that came from the so-called "golden" era.  If you are a lover of adventure games, then you really need to check this series out.  These games are selling for a song these days, so there's no excuse not to reward the developers for their talent and hard work.","December 8, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While each individual episode of the Blackwell games isn’t that long, they are incredibly deep, have great writing, and interesting concepts all around. The basic story, regardless of which one you’re playing, is you belong to a family of mediums and your ever-present spectral partner in crime is there to back you up.\n\nOften you have to seek out spirits that are having difficulty coming to terms with death and need assistance in passing on.

The voice acting is excellent, and, except for the first game, the ambience is so deliciously noir with a great smooth-jazz soundtrack.  While the actual graphics are, obviously, old-school adventure-game pixelly, the game is still beautiful.\n\nRegarding Blackwell Unbound specifically: I found the female protagonist - Lauren Blackwell - to be a pleasure.

You also have a few new gadgets to use, which help make a logical and clever way to move the story on. The relationship between the two leads is just as strong, but Lauren is much more world-weary than Rosa (the female lead in the first game in the series). This suits the darker tone of the stories and serves well to show how living with a spirit guide and dealing with unresolved death could take its toll. One thing the game lacks for me is the use of close-ups when a character is speaking, which I loved in the first game.

The plot is similar, some characters are the same, and the gameplay in general is that of a nicely crafted adventure game. There are however some differences also, such as different art style, different dynamic between characters, and some adjustments to gameplay from the first game.\n\nWithout going into spoilers too much, here are pros and cons, according to me.\n\nPROS:\nLow price;\nReally good story, better than the first game, in my opinion;\nInteresting dialogue;\nBetter puzzles, didn't get stuck as much as the first one;\n\nCONS:\nAbsolutely completely remarkably poor choice of achievements, some are impossible to find without the guide, some are downright annoying. Sure some are OK, but that is not an excuse for the two smoking achievements that have no purpose and do nothing except irritate the player who has to replay the game just because the girl smoked and extra smoke or did not smoke enough.\nLess likable art style, art feels rushed and, well, amateurish. No character portraits, which is disappointing, especially compared to the first game.\nNeeded to play the game twice to get the commentary achievement, and then another time to get the smoking achievements (the girl smokes more when Joey is active and you are listening to the commentary). This is 3 times I had to play a game that does not change one bit from playthrough to playthrough. I find this completely unacceptable and poor game design (believe it or not, achievements are part of game design, and if you choose to include them, make sure they add to the game and not subtract from it).\nI feel the need to type things in manually demands more from player, as in have a piece of paper and a pen on them when playing. I found this to be somewhat annoying, A game should not need to do that to a player.\n\nOverall, I can only recommend this game because of the good story and puzzles.","November 8, 2014","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It features a female protagonist who is real in her representation and oddly awkward and socially maladjusted (It's charming). Blackwell Unbound, the second installment, features similar point and click problem solving while revealing an interesting backstory. Unfortunately, this game is not nearly as interesting as the first and comparatively there are very few out-of-the-box problem solving situations. It lays flat compared to its predecessor but still offers some benefits to those who are dedicated to the series. 6/10.","December 20, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Jumping back to 1973, you're placed in the shoes of Rosa Blackwell's "Auntie" Lauren, Joey's previous partner back in the 70s before things went... not so great.\n\nMost of the elements from The Blackwell Legacy return this time around, minus the search engine given the lack of consumer internet access at the time, obviously. Once again, real New York scenery and elements are intertwined with the Blackwell fiction, creating a perfect hybrid that feels like it could have happened were there more ghosts hanging around. Lauren is a nice change of pace from Rosa as well; their personalities differ enough to provide a change of pace, but at the same time, you can see where Rosa gets some of her sass. Also changed this time around is the in-game art style, having been handed off to a different artist this time around. The visual shift is also a nice change, and further cements the differences between Rosa and her aunt. Personally, I think Unbound's representation of the door before the afterlife is my favorite in the entire series.\n\nDespite it being a jump back from the series' start, Blackwell Unbound is still worth playing, both for the context it provides and some of the groundwork it lays later on. Really, there's no reason to avoid playing any of the games in the series, so get to it.","January 7","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/beeedup/recommended/80340/","beeedup","no shirt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/beeedup/","492 products in account","My experience with Blackwell Unbound was completely different than my experience with The Blackwell Legacy, which is both a good thing and a bad thing. Some of the problems I had with the first entry were remedied in Blackwell Unbound, while some of the shining points in the first game were surprisingly absent from this game.\n\nThe story premise has really started to interest me. I think it has the same kind of longevity as some template-based TV serials like X-Files or Star Trek. In his commentary track, Dave Gilbert discusses the "lingering ghost" trope and why it's interesting, and he's right--it is interesting. As far as the story goes, I am now "on-board" with the Blackwell games (although the final scene of Blackwell Unbound posed a huge moral problem for me). It was really cool to play as Lauren; she is an interesting character, especially alongside Joey. I wish I could have seen more interaction between them.\n\nThe gameplay of Blackwell Unbound differs from its predecessor by allowing the player to switch between playing as Joey and playing as Lauren. I think this is and always has been a cool mechanic. Unfortunately, unlike some other successful adventure games who have used this mechanic, like Maniac Mansion and The Cave, Blackwell Unbound doesn't really make good use of the ability to switch characters. Joey is only necessary for a couple of small actions, and he is otherwise unnecessary. However, Gilbert does explain in the commentary track that Blackwell Unbound was meant to be a short project to tide players over until the more ambitious Blackwell Convergence was finished, so I assume that the character-switching will be put to better use in the next game in the series.\n\nThe graphics and voice acting are other pieces of evidence that Blackwell Unbound seems to have been given less thought and attention than the first game (I have not yet played Convergence, so I can't compare). I was really impressed with The Blackwell Legacy's graphics and voice acting; everything looked really painstakingly drawn, and the voice actors gave great performances. Although some of the environments in Blackwell Unbound look really great (Jambalaya Records, Lauren's apartment) some of the environments looked pretty rushed (the map screen, the construction site), and there were a couple times I turned down my speakers because I was embarrassed that someone might hear the terrible voice acting. The problem with the voice acting seems to be that the actors were not very well-matched for the roles they played. Three of the characters (The Countess, Harriet Sherman, and Joseph Mitchell) are 50+ years old but are voiced by young people trying to imitate "old" voices, which makes for some really cringe-worthy moments. Another character, Dwayne, has a pretty embarrassing Jamaican accent and in the credits he appears to be voiced by a white guy. I hate to criticize peoples' acting abilities, especially since I'm certain I'd be absolutely terrible at it, but I feel like the voice performances in Blackwell Unbound really got in the way of my enjoying the game.\n\nThe puzzle logic in Blackwell Unbound really irked me, too. Obviously, in a series like Blackwell, the player needs to discover clues to progress. In Blackwell Unbound, there's a really cool mechanic that tasks the player with remembering and manually entering into a phonebook names that other characters mention in dialogue. I love it when games make me pull out a pad of paper and a pencil to solve a puzzle. My problem is that most of the "clues" seem really obvious and unnaturally forced into the dialogue ("That's how we treat your kind at Johnny Ivory's!"), so it felt like Gilbert left a really obvious trail of breadcrumbs for me to follow.\n\nThe commentary track this time features Gilbert alongside one of the game's artists. It is sometimes interesting to hear about the processes they went through in designing the game. Dave Gilbert wasn't as annoying to me as he was in the commentary for The Blackwell Legacy; maybe he's growing on me.\n\nIn summary, Blackwell Unbound was a much more interesting game than The Blackwell Legacy, but I think The Blackwell Legacy had a greater level of polish and seemed more like a complete game. I'm excited to play Blackwell Convergence, and I hope it has some decent voice-acting.","January 16","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's like book of the month then we discuss about it.\nI played the previously purchased one, which is The Blackwell Legacy. I did enjoy it.\n\nThough the main character became Lauren Blackwell, who was initially dead in the previous game. It provided some insight of what her history is all about. For the main focus of this review, I will compare the previous game, Blackwell Legacy, with this game.\n\nSo far, Legacy was a precursor to what was about to come, it was just a taste. It focused on that one case, but Unbound focused on two, which seems unrelated till we recognise that there are connections aside.\n\nI liked how Unbound fleshed out the character of Lauren Blackwell, which to most of the audiences, thought she was a strange case of dementia. Her dynamics with Joey Mallone was snarky but when fleshed out, it's fantastic. It is interesting on how their relationship works. I liked the banter between them and enjoyed it the most.\n\nAt first though, I seem to get lost with the game. I didn't know what to do, but I started to find my feet after humdrums of clicking them. The stories were interesting. I got really sad about the stories, but I was invested enough to finish the game myself.\n\nI enjoy the game and the graphics seems to be better this time around.
