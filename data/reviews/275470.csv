And i have deleted it. Don't really like that updated review will still be somewhere on the bottom of the list. Also i want to do it justice. Developers of this game are super cool for supporting their game long after the release and trying to find a way to please all the gamers. Controls are now WAY better than they were (now it actually selects tiles, not the objects on the tiles and there is a visual cue what object will be selected if you click your mouse button, also they've added more alternate controls options). For such great support only they deserve a Yes.\n\nThe game itself is a mix of puzzle and speed. I don't really like the speed element, especially when the puzzle element itself can be mind boggling alone, and then you have to do all very fast. But that's just me. And you can still do just puzzles, if you don't want to earn every star (sorry, light bulb) on a level. Artistic style is cartoonish and pleasant. There is also a shop in the game to spend your dollars earned for completing the levels and doing extra bonus things on some levels. You can buy outfits for your characters :) It's a bit silly, but still, you are using those points you are collecting, not just playing for the highscore and if you are a completionist it may be fun to buy all the outfits and complete some achievements along. All in all a little pretty puzzle game with a nice support. But if you don't like the speed element, maybe you should skip it or play just the puzzle parts, though many of them still require to move objects in time.","December 24, 2014","true","3.2"," 56 of 62 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","56","62","0","0"

You can customize your character and unlock more characters. There is something I don't like about this game tho which is the 'Time' and 'Move' concept. I don't like these because it effects you from unlocking other levels. If you think you like this game, go buy this and save Chip!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/275470/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Chip is a logic puzzle game that is very much focused on efficiency. Finishing a level isn't in question; instead, you are timed, your moves are counted, and there are some extra collectables in some of the levels.\nIt also another component of customization. There are 3 characters, with several slots for cosmetic items. You buy these with in-game money that you get from completing the levels. It doesn't affect the game at all, it's simply a mechanism to give the player a goal.\n\nAs I've been trying to do recently, I'll try to break the review into sections, instead of describing the whole game and its problems all at once.\n\nAudio-Visual Design\nNot much to say in here.  Its interface is a bit iOS-y, with big buttons, and the controls relying only on clicking and dragging. I'll get into the controls later, but the rest works fine for what it is.(1)\nI liked the cartoon-y style, with bold lines and clean colors. Nice job on that.\nThe music also started out to my liking, but there isn't enough variety, and quickly got repetitive.\n\n\nGeneral Structure\nThere are 4 worlds, each with its new mechanics. The first 3 worlds have 20 levels each (with additional 5 challenge levels). The last one seemed to have been added after the game's release, featuring only 5 levels.\n\nEach level has 3 stars, one for the timed element, one for the number of moves, and one for simply finishing it. Leaderboards are only present for your overall score.\nAdditionally, some levels have a bag of money, or a cosmetic piece for you to collect. You get gold as you progress, and can then spend it on the shop. You can buy headgear, dresses, boots, etc. to use in each character. These are only visible in the starting screen, and in the level. The objective is to get an energy ball to the your character, and the character appears as you've customized.\nIt's more of a distraction than a mechanic, but hey, it's cool that it's there, I'm sure there are people who appreciate those details a lot.\n\n\nGeneral Mechanics\nYou can always see the whole level in the screen at once. Unfortunately, there's no zooming option, which could solve lots of problems. But more on that later. (2)\nThe level effectively starts when you do your first move. The puzzles consist on shooting an energy ball in a certain direction, and then move objects around to alter the balls trajectory. There are object that reflect the energy ball, portals, magnets, etc. etc. There are many different elements at play, but they're well introduced and don't overwhelm you. Tutorialisation was one of the highlights of this game, for me, but not without its problems.(3)\n\nYou can rotate and/or move some objects. For example, there's a wall that reflect the energy ball. However, if it's not the right angle, the ball is simply destroyed, or sent in a direction that you didn't want it to. Or, when starting the level, you may want to shoot the ball into a different direction. Rotation and Movement are level dependent.\nThere's no point in explaining details here, just trying to give you an idea.\n\nEvery object is already placed within the level when you start. It doesn't ask you to construct the level to solve the puzzle. Everything is placed, and you have to play accordingly.\nIt's a bit limiting, but that's due to the game's (valid) design. If you don't like that type of puzzle, you're better off looking elsewhere.\n\n\nAlright, onto the major design problems/highlights.\n\n1.Controls\nThis is probably the biggest issue with Chip. You click an object to select it, and hold if you want to rotate it, or click another tile to move it. The problem is that the hitboxes are very dodgy. Part of it is due to the isometric perspective, and part of it is due to its size. I've had to restart levels countless times because I wanted to move and ended up selecting another object, or rotated it the wrong way. The alternative controls scheme helps, by moving the camera with RMB. The main has movement AND the camera tied to LMB which aggravates every control problems.\nIt's particularly bad in levels cluttered with objects.\n\nAnother huge problem with bad controls, is the efficiency in the level design. Since you are always timed, and your moves are counted, it's too easy to screw up, without it being the player's fault.\nThe game is not pausable, although there is a slow-down when you have a object selected. It's not enough. They wanted to make a real-time, reflex based puzzle game, and sort of hammered it in, trying not to compromise that initial vision.\n\nA zoom featured could have helped with the hitboxes, I feel. The closer you are, the more precise the movement is, and could lead to fewer screwups.\n\n2.Time Elements\nThere are two elements of time in Chip. One of them, is the time limit for each level. The other, is how sequencial your actions are. You'll have to move and rotate the same object several times, depending on which sections the ball is, and also have to coordinate every move to achieve each star. This could be great, but there are several reasons why they fall apart.\nAgain, it seems like they wanted to make a game reliant on being fast and efficient, but didn't quite know how to do it properly, hence making those mechanics very artificial.\n\nThe solutions rely more on reflexes than logic, sometimes. You can often see how to finish the levels, but end up failing because of the controls. Also, creating a time limit makes no sense to me, in such a game. There's usually only one solutions, and the creative side of the game is so low, that having it timed doesn't really help. Besides, it is often impossible to get the moves star and the time star at once. That's right. You'll have to replay the levels to get them separately...\n\nI don't think it the real-time element should be present at all, as it doesn't enhance the experience in any way. Plus the clunky controls, it's a nightmare.\nA simple pause would do this game wonders! Time the levels as you want, but make it count only when things are moving. The slowing down helps, but it doesn't quite reach it, and it's just there to stay "true" to the initial design, which doesn't work. If the player paused the game when moving an object, it would certainly feel much better.\n\n3.Tutorialization\nThe game isn't awful. Despite having critical problems, it has some very elegant design as well!\nHow it teaches the player is one of those features. It progressively introduces mechanics, one by one, and has a couple of levels that focus on teaching the player. Those are easy, but often lead the player in the right direction to beat the following levels, that are a bit more complex.\nFor the most part of the game, levels didn't overwhelm me, and the solutions were spot-on! Later on, it all crashes, as you need to get each star separately, there are many objects close together, the previous 6-7 moves are now 30, etc.\n\nAnother detail, is regarding moves and the tutorials/subsequent level design. The moves counter is supposedly optimized. However, in some levels, you can do better (which feels good, of course!) by hitting the ball while the object is moving towards the next position. It's like hitting two birds with one stone. That particular detail is almost tutorialized early on. There was a level that couldn't be beaten with all the stars without this trick. If that is the case, one would expect them to follow with it, and take that into all of the levels' design.  They don't.\nI realize that this is a very minor gripe, but it's one of those details that stick out, to me. And this mechanic made some levels really satisfying too!\n\nWell, I'm out of characters.. I was positively surprised at first! Unfortunately, when the difficulty ramps up, the game falls apart and every problem becomes too evident. I can't recommend it, but it has potential!","December 23, 2014","false","8.2"," 27 of 42 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","27","42","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/recommended/275470/","gosedre","Gosedre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/","215 products in account","Some challenging puzzles with funky graphics and music. All in all good fun... Just.\n\nUnfortunately I found the collision detection to be pretty awful. For example to move a block you have to click on it and then on the destination tile. But many times either the first or second click would have no effect for no apparent reason. This severly hampers completing some puzzles in the time limit or indeed at all.\n\nI have a slight suspicion however that the problem may not in fact be a collision detection issue but instead be due to clicking having multiple purposes. A plain click is to select objects and their destinations. Holding down the mouse button triggers rotation of objects. It may well be that when I think I am selecting an object, I am in fact holding the mouse button down just a tad too long on a non-rotating object and so nothing happens.\n\nWhatever the cause of the problem, it can be very frustrating and for me almost ruins and otherwise charming and fun game. What a shame as I'm sure it would be easy to fix the problem.","October 28, 2015","true","25.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

Oftentimes these are relatively straightforward, but in some cases they involve meticulous timing in the movement of pieces, which can vary from very satisfying to quite frustrating depending on your preferences.\n\nI was able to beat every level (although not every time/move challenge) within roughly 6 hours, so consider that a reasonable ballpark for amount of gameplay available.

You have to get 50 lightbulbs out of the 20 levels provided (and up to five bonus levels, though you'll only have up to three to help boost your first world lightbulb count).  Each level gives you up to three lightbulbs -- one for completing it (so that's 20 for getting through the levels), one for completing it fast enough (another 20), and one for completing it in few enough moves (another 20), and you might have up to 9 more possible from the three bonus levels you'll have access to when you have fewer than 50 lightbulbs).  You don't have to get all three lightbulbs at the same time, thankfully, and there are also one-time treasures that you can retrieve (usually taking more time/moves than you'd otherwise need).  But still, out of 69 possible lightbulbs, you have to get 50 of them just to get to the second world.\n\nThankfully, the first world is relatively easy.  So I found myself with 48 lightbulbs coming out of it, no access to the second world, and had to scrounge a couple more lightbulbs out of one of the extra levels.\n\nGranted, I've never been a huge fan of puzzle games.  So take what I'm writing with a grain of salt or something I guess.\n\nEdit: Okay, it turns out it wasn't that hard to pick up another four lightbulbs from the first world.  Oh well.  Still, now that I've gotten into the second world, I still feel frustrated and annoyed.  Again, I guess puzzle games just aren't my thing, but certainly having me stay this long by keeping the Steam trading cards drip-dripping like this has only increased my dissatisfaction.\n\n(Disclosure: I acquired this game from a promotion offering a free Steam key of this game, at the Indie Gala Store.)","April 14","false","3.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It would have been nice to see some truly devious puzzles, seeing as they never get particularly difficult, and it's a shame they never finished releasing the expansion level set, but overall a good play and worth the price.

The first thing I did when I launched this game was try that and now I cannot get it back to 1920x1080 because the save button is off the bottom of the screen. I tried moving the window using the Alt-Space, 'M', then Arrow Keys to try and see the save button but the game auto-moves back to its original position. I also tried Re-installing and that did not fix it either. Sounds like a fun game, but I can't play it because the settings were not thought through. There is not even the dialogue: "Reverting to old settings in 8..." with a keep settings button for protection against this. If you have any other suggestions on how to fix this, please post!\n\nWould Still Recommend the Game!

The first thing I did when I launched this game was try that and now I cannot get it back to 1920x1080 because the save button is off the bottom of the screen. I tried moving the window using the Alt-Space, 'M', then Arrow Keys to try and see the save button but the game auto-moves back to its original position. I also tried Re-installing and that did not fix it either. Sounds like a fun game, but I can't play it because the settings were not thought through. There is not even the dialogue: "Reverting to old settings in 8..." with a keep settings button for protection against this. If you have any other suggestions on how to fix this, please post!\n\nWould Still Recommend the Game!

I'm not disappointed. I wouldn't call it best puzzle game out there but for sure it's enjoyable, as long as you are fan of puzzle games. Are the controls bad? Nope. Is this game hard? Not really, maybe when you will start to learn new stuff (teleport, magnets etc.) then those mini tutorials are not much friendly to learn about but once you will grasp what it does, you won't have much trouble. Each of puzzle is small and don't really demand from you to spend long time trying to figure out how to deliver delicious electricity. You can also dress up you robot, which is kind of fun. I wouldn't buy Chip at full price, maybe at some -75% promo. If you enjoy puzzle games then hunt it at some sales.","May 24","true","15.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All in all good fun... Just.\n\nUnfortunately I found the collision detection to be pretty awful. For example to move a block you have to click on it and then on the destination tile. But many times either the first or second click would have no effect for no apparent reason. This severly hampers completing some puzzles in the time limit or indeed at all.\n\nI have a slight suspicion however that the problem may not in fact be a collision detection issue but instead be due to clicking having multiple purposes. A plain click is to select objects and their destinations. Holding down the mouse button triggers rotation of objects. It may well be that when I think I am selecting an object, I am in fact holding the mouse button down just a tad too long on a non-rotating object and so nothing happens.\n\nWhatever the cause of the problem, it can be very frustrating and for me almost ruins and otherwise charming and fun game. What a shame as I'm sure it would be easy to fix the problem.","May 4, 2014","true","2.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You  just point and click. Move objects around to navigate a ball of energy to hit Chip and wake him up.\n\nI've only played a few levels so far and the puzzles are pretty easy in the beggining which allows you to get the hang of how the game works.\nIf you are a prefectionist however it will be pretty challenging beating the clock (beating the clock isnt necessary in order to beat the level).\nI expect that itll be harder since you will be moving obstacles here and there to prevent the evergy ball from hitting the obstacles as you navigate it across the level to Chip the robot.\n\n\n-------------\n\nOne thing about this game that kind of pisses me off is that whenever I click on an object its like the game doesnt detect my clicks until the 2nd or 3rd time I click. This leads to misclicks and that leads to not being able to beat the clock.\n\n-----------\n\nOther than that the game is great for people who love puzzle games. It's fairly cheap and a nice simple game to play and kill some time with if you're bored.\n","July 7, 2014","true","9.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

But I'm playing on my PC, and this game shouts "mobile game" from the first second you start it.\nBiggest issue I have with Chip is that it often takes more than one click to detect an action, and that can be a problem in a game that requires speed.\nDo I recommend it? I'm stuck between Yes and No but unfortunately Steam knows only 0 and 1.\nThis is a strictly subjective review. Try it out and see if you like it - on sale it can be bought for under 1€ and you might enjoy it.\n","November 27, 2015","false","0.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaxBurg1/recommended/275470/","MaxBurg1","Tony Bamanaboni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaxBurg1/","76 products in account","Very fun! At first I didn't really expect much from Chip. It's a standard puzzle game that looks like it belongs on an iPhone or an Android phone, because of its simple design, short levels and simple scoring system that's identical to the system in Bad Piggies, but this is not the case.  Despite what you may think at first, some of the levels in this game can make you stop dead in your tracks to think about your actions throughoutly before you actually do something, because this game has very high demands for both time and the amount of moves you make. And getting the top rating is actually quite important, because unlocking bonus levels and other level packs depends on your ratings throughout the game. You move cannons, magnets and bouncy walls and turn them around to create a clear path from the cannon to the robot, which you can customize. Some of the customizations for the robots make me worried about this game being struck with lawsuit- being given Finn's hat from Adventure Time, the Magatama from Ace Attorney, etc. The graphics I find very cute, even though they look like they were made in Adobe Flash. Overall, I like the game, but the game, but it's a little too expensive- quickly, nag it before the sale ends! :)","September 5, 2014","true","2.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/recommended/275470/","djsoulfck","DJSF - off @ twitch.tv/sinlike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/","416 products in account","Chip is a very good puzzle game that requires you to plan out your strategy on a grid while utilizing reflecting mirrors and other mechanisms like magnets.\n\nIf you like puzzle games that challenge you to plan your moves carefully, then you will enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are good - the artstyle is cute and refreshing. The background is simple, and you can add cosmetics to change your character's appearance (there are also 3 characters to choose from, two of which must be unlocked). The music and sounds are decent, however, within 15 minutes I decided to mute all sounds in favor of my own. The story is very basic, as the focus of the game is more on puzzle solving.\n\nThe controls are easy to pick up since you will only be using the mouse. One problem, however, is the needlessly large hitboxes when clicking on items - if you don't click right on the middle of an item, you risk clicking a neighboring item that you may not have wanted (can be particularly annoying when you are trying to finish a level under the time limit and accidentally click the wrong item). The learning curve is minimal to moderate - the levels get progressively difficult, and new mechanics are introduced after a number of levels have been cleared. There are also challenge levels that can be quite the brain teaser, but are very rewarding if you can solve them. The tutorial is quick and helpful, and whenever new mechanics are introduced, they are always explained.\n\nGameplay consists of you getting a cannon to shoot an electricity ball at your player character. As the game progresses, you will have to use mirrors (switching the angles) to manipulate the pathway of the electricity ball. There are also things like batteries (which act as barriers) and magnets (which pull/push metal items), adding extra layers of complexity to the game.\n\nEach stage has three clear points (lightbulbs) - you get one for clearing the level, one for finishing under a certain time limit, and another for completing the stage with x moves. The game even tells you that some levels require you to play a level again, as sometimes meeting the time completion requires you to use more moves (or vice versa). There are also items in some stages that provide you with extra money or a new item in the store if you can shoot it and send it to your player character.\n\nOverall, the game is quite fun and can be a challenge. The puzzles increase in difficulty at a steady pace, and many of the challenge levels require a lot of trial and error to find a solution. If you like this type of puzzle-solving, then you should really enjoy Chip.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","September 28, 2014","true","2.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The puzzles aren't hard, and the only challenge comes from getting all of the lightbulbs, the worst of which is having to complete the puzzle in a certain time. These time limits are absurdly short and are frustrating to meet when doing the puzzle at a normal and comfortable pace, especially with the bad controls. There also isn't a very good backstory as to why the puzzles have to be solved, but that's fine, as it's a puzzle game, not a story-driven game.","May 26","false","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Goode","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197993838159/","97 products in account","All in all this is an OK game. I think if the developer had gone w/ a different art style(ie, less cartoony) it would be more visually appealing, but that is merely my opinion. Some of the puzzles are control/time sensitive, which is generally not a good design decision for puzzle games, especially considering that the controls can be a bit finicky. In that same vein I see this game as having a lot of potential for being ported to tablets, except that the control issues would make the game unplayable using a touch screen(I have noticed that trying to operate slowly tends to eliminate many of the problems).\n\nThe game lacks a windowed fullscreen option, which is somewhat annoying for users with multiple monitors, although hardly critical as the game behaves well in full screen on a dual monitor setup. The game lacks the ability to zoom in and out on the puzzles, which wouldn't be an issue except that at times players need to move the puzzle around in the view because there are regions that are not visible(this is compounded by the above mentioned control issues and time sensitivity of some puzzle solutions).\n\nI added CHIP to my wishlist so I could pick it up on sale(it was $2.37 when I bought it), and after playing it I can say that it is decent enough that I'll get my money out of it. For those considering purchasing this game I would recommend waiting until it is on sale(in my opinion it was worth the $2.37, but not the current list price of $6.99).","November 5, 2014","true","7.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It seems like between these mobile-port style puzzle games, 2D retro platformers and RPGMaker shovelware there is not much else releasing regularly on Steam. Chip works just fine, it has some cool twists in mechanics and has a nice amount of difficulty in later levels. However, this sentiment could be copy/pasted for just about any of these puzzle games and it really doesn’t do anything special to stand out from the crowd. If you enjoy these kinds of games, Chip works, but it’s really nothing I would recommend to a friend.","September 19, 2015","false","6.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

Chip is a cute puzzle game.  I generally love puzzle games.  However, Chip ends up being fairly difficult to unlock new levels.  Are the levels too hard?  Am I just a bad gamer?  Maybe, but I think I'd have less trouble if the controls weren't so inconsistent.  Getting clicks to register is intermittent at best.  There's nothing like missing the time goal because the game refuses to register your mouse click.  The game claims that you can use the keyboard, but you can't, other than to scroll a bit.  Oh, and Chip still registers those keypresses when it's not the active window.  I started writing this review and finally closed chip because I was tired of it twitching every time I hit any of WASD.\nIf Chip fixes their control problems, this could be a great little puzzle game.","June 3, 2015","false","4.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Cheers!\n\nI was playing the game and having fun, fully prepared to come and claim that those who are having trouble with imprecise controls must need to replace their mouse. And then, I hit level 12. Suddenly there's a problem. I can click on an object but when I try to place it, not only is the hitbox incredibly tiny, but I swear it moves. Now, this alone is fine with me; if a game is fun, I'll play around with placement to get the puzzle aspect correct in order to compensate for poor controls...and make no mistake: Chip is fun. However, throw in a countdown clock and it becomes an exercise in frustration. A clock is fine ONLY in cases of precise controls; this game lacks those controls. For the developers, there's only one choice here: Ditch the clock or fix the mechanics; otherwise, there's no point in the player continuing.\n\nChip has, believe it or not, been bundled 11 different times (as of this writing), sometimes as a free bonus game. And yet, according to Astats, while 293 people have completed the first level, only 114 (39%) have finished the first 20 (introductory) levels. There's a reason for that! Puzzle games should be fun, not rage inducing. A player should never feel as though they are fighting against the interface. This game has charm, thoughtfulness, and personality, but it's being let down by poor controls. That's a shame. As for me, I'm uninstalling. Life is too short, and there are far too many other excellent games to play...free or not.\n\nUPDATE: On Dec 23, the developer released an update containing, among other things, " New selection reticule to show what the user is about to select [and] - Object selection is based on tile again now (due to reticule) and no  [sic]  the objects sprite." It seemed only fair to give it another chance, since I genuinely enjoyed the actual gameplay, just not the inability to move any certain selected objects. Unfortunately, this has made a new problem pop up: the game simply won't recognize when I click on objects sometimes (level 15 is an example of this; although it did occur earlier, I wasn't quite sure what had happened). You can click all you want, wherever you want, the game simply won't recognize that you're doing so. Resetting the level sometimes works for the first click, and after that the object is dead again.\n\nI know I'm in the minority here, but I cannot recommend a puzzle game where the interface is this broken.","November 23, 2014","false","2.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

I see now why it was given away. This game is unbelievably bad, and I will tell you why.\n\nI.Gameplay:\nThe gameplay is simple, move a few machine things around so that an electro ball can power up chip. The levels are based on a 3 star system:time, moves used, and completing the level itself. The time limit is always bull. It gives you around 10 seconds to be able to move around 5 different things, AND shoot the electro ball(which moves unbelievably slow). Even if I know the exact answer to the level, the time limit is impossible to fulfill, therefore limiting the things you buy in the shop, due to the stars giving you money. It seems bad that a game can't even give you 3 stars on the first 10 levels, which are all difficult too. For a puzzle game that makes you think, it makes no sense to give a time limit, so basically you have to play a level 10 times just to get 3 stars. Also, this game is 20MB. This could be a port to a crappy iOS or Google Play game, and I assume it was due to the high FPS I get on my terrible laptop.\nII.Logic\nOh boy, this game makes perfect sense! A cannon to shoot an electro ball, and the ball can reflect off walls like its a rubber ball! NOPE F*CK YOU LOGIC OF THIS GAME.\nIII.Replayability/Multiplayer\nYou have to replay each level just to get 3 stars, over and over and over. It gets old. Quickly. There is a leaderboard but none of my friends have even heard of Chip. Good, they don't have to go through what I had to. Holy crap this game blows.\n\nFinal Verdict: 4/10 The game looks nice, I guess(1), its a game(1), it was given for free(1) and it has gameplay that is not broken(other than the cheaply programmed score system) (1).","June 7, 2015","false","4.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The game looks simple at first, but as you play level after level, you get to meet new things and find more ways to transfer the electric ball to the robot.The characters(Robots) can be customized with different accessories which you can unlock by collecting gifts found in some of the levels. Its a nice puzzle game and if you are into these kind of games I recommend you giving it a try.","February 7","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to help recharge chip by allowing the energy to reach him utilizing certain objects and avoiding obstacles in the pathway. A tutorial aspect helps guide the player at levels where new objects or obstacles appear. The game gives you a star for each in every level: time of completion, number of moves taken( each level does a countdown from the expected number it should take), and simply for completing the level. Certain levels unlock when you get a targeted number of stars. It may look like a cute/simple puzzle game but the levels get fairly strategic and complicated. I think it’s fun/quirky little game.","June 4","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
