She has replayed the dwarf and human noble origins repeatedely just to know all possible outcomes (her favorite seems to be a dwarf rogue).  She is so good at playing the game she can run through it up to the final battle over a weekend (friday night, saturday, done sunday noon)\ni was only able to write this review because she is at work.\n\n...I miss my wife, can i have her back yet?\n\nI guess i should recommend it because she plays it so voraciously?\n\nEDIT: 4/8/15: HOLY FRAK PEOPLE! :D\nfor those of you thave have commented:\nYes the wife thinks i am like Alistair sometimes\nYes i have a beard\nYes she slays the dragons in the family...so far... but I am slowly catching up. (well she doesn't slay them directly per se, but she sets up the dragon to be slain by some warrior/fighter, typically Aveline, Fenris, or Iron Bull)\n\nDA 2 was just as time consuming as DA: O (but with only 700-ish hours gameplay over 2014; less choices with char-gen means less replayability for her, only 6-8 characters made this time instead of 30-40)\nDA: I ( which i just got for her in Feb. as a late X-mas gift) has totally consumed her time (AGAIN!) but with her new job she has only managed 300 hours (i estimate about 25 of it are my two characters) She is frustrated she cannot romance Varric\nshe loves Iron Bull  (who the hell doesn't he's got the best lines, along with Sera)\n\n\ni told her no DLC until the main storyline is finished,  she gave me puppy dog eyes, i haven't cracked...yet...\n\nI may be a bit biased but yes i do believe she is very awesome and I can geek out with her without her eyes glazing over, alternatively i dont Glaze-out either when she geeks out at me.\n\n...so, hooray?  for totally life consuming video games...?","October 6, 2014","true","517.4"," 1,924 of 1,973 people (98%) found this review helpful 683 people found this review funny","98","924","1","683","30"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrPinkies/recommended/47810/","DrPinkies","DrPinkies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrPinkies/","145 products in account","Disclaimer: This is my favorite game of all time, so I apologize for any obsessive fan-girling that may occur within this review.\ntl;dr Pro's and Con's list at the bottom.\n\nTheres so many things I could say about this game, I love it so much.  A majority of my time playing is on console, where I easily have 500+ hours, as well as every achievement in the game as well as additional content.  I'm not much of a reviewer (this being my first lengthy one), so to keep it simple I'll seperate it into sections.\n\nCharacter Creation/Leveling-\nThere is a fair bit of customization when you create your character.  There are 3 races to choose from (Human, Dwarf, and Elf) which all give different bonus stats.  From there, you will pick your characters class (Warrior, Rogue, or Mage).  All of those classes expand at later levels, with your choice of sub-classes for each (unlocked at levels 7 and 14), which are unlocked by doing different things in the game, or learning them from certain characters.  So no, you aren't born with the ability to magically understand how to be a Bard, or a Templar, you need to actually be taught by someone, or learn the knowledge elsewhere.  Visual choices are alright, standard RPG things like different hair, different eyes, all of which will be covered by a helmet/cowl anyway no doubt.  Either way, you could always grab a mod or two for more character visuals, but I'll try to keep this review on the base game alone.  When you level up there are hefty decisions to be made.  Not only are there abilities for you to use in combat, there are also different abilties for out of combat purposes.  Are you going to put that point into your combat knowledge, unlocking the next tier of weapon abilites?  Or are you going to put it in lockpicking?  The next dungeon might have a door you can't quite pick yet.  Choose carefully...\n\nStory-\nThe best thing about this game is the enthralling story!  From character creation, based on your race, and class even changes how your story begins.  Are you a human noble, living cozy in your castle?  Perhaps a dwarf whose fallen on hard times, and has gone down a life of crime.  Maybe even a mage, stripped from your family and sent off to the Circle of Magi to be watched by the Templars.  In most cases, different events from your "Origin" story come back to either aid/hinder you based on how you handled them.  This game is full of heart-wrenching decisions, where you need to decide between being the good guy, or getting something that would be extremely helpful on your quest/not put you in danger.  There's a fair bit of situations where there is no clear-cut decision to be a good guy, someone is getting hurt and it will be your fault, and you can be sure it will change how certain people treat you/your story in general.\n\nCharacters-\nI might have lied about the story being the best part, because the different characters in the game are amazing.  I could go hours talking about the different personalities characters have, but I'll stick just to your party in this, because that's who you'll spend most of the time with obviously.  Your party as it starts getting full, is a ragtag group of different people, with various different outlooks on things. Literally, you might have an apostate witch, a templar, a chantry zealot, and a drunken dwarf all at once.   Each party member has a relationship bar, which goes up or down depending on your decisions and how you talk to them, which in turn effects how they treat you/open up to you.  You could make someone spit in your face and leave the party for good, or even turn and attack you, or they could open up to you about their past giving you a special quest to help them with something personal.  On top of balancing decisons on how it will effect you, and the world around you, you also have to think of how your party members will react to it.  Each character in you party has a lot of diologue opportunities, and if you pay close attention you might be able to find them a gift relevant to something they have said, or perform an action they mentioned.  You can even have relationships with some of the characters, and watch a blooming love grow, as well as listen to the rest of your party snicker and banter about you and soandso last night in a tent together.  If one party member is growing affectionate of you, you can see them get jealous when they discover your relationship with another.\nYou know characters are a big part, when some of the ADD ON CONTENT IS FOR THE CHARACTERS.  Some of the additional content in the game focuses on a certain characters past, and another on his/her events after the story.  Of course based on what you did in the story, it effects it as well.\n\nGameplay-\nIf you played Dragon Age 2, don't expect this game to be as hack and slash as that one was.  This is by far much more tactical.  One of the coolest features is allowing you to set up your party members tactics in certain situations.  You can set a condition where if 4 enemies are clumped together, your mage shoots a fireball in the center of them, or if your tank gets below 20% health, your Warrior activates an ability to take aggro off of him.  On harder difficulties, you might find yourself hitting the spacebar key pretty quick to pause the game, so you can asses the situation, and assign party members specific orders.\n\nDifficulty-\nIf your new to the game, start on the easiest mode for sure.  This game is brutal on harder difficulties, and while the ability to set your AI party's tactics is beneficial, you will need to be able to know what abilities do what, the different sub-classes to branch down..etc.  Even on easy, you'll find yourself in some situations pausing, and getting some much needed healing done, or think on how to take down a challenging foe.  (Seriously, f*** Revenants).  And remember to be careful when setting your Mage's tactics, there IS FRIENDLY FIRE with mage abilities.  That fireball you just set to go off when the enemies clumped?  You killed them, but your rogue with them.\n\nGlitches/Bugs-\nThere are of course some glitches in the game, scaling from minor textures on occasion, to something that could ruin a combat situation and make you die.  Some of the notable ones include:\n-Enemies not spawning in missions if you leave a set area/charge their spawn\n-Your attack speed going back to default if it gets insanely high\n-Your character not being able to get good placement in combat, making him run in place\n-A certain party members arm getting stuck in place like she's waiting for a bird to perch on it\n-Gifts not giving the appropriate amount of points on the relationship bar\nAnd you might find a couple others.  Fortunately, the major ones are fixable by mods that are readily avalible on sites such as Nexus mods.  However as I said before, I'm reviewing this based on the base game.\n\nPros and Cons-\nPros:\n-Amazing story!\n-Heart-wrenching decisions, some with no clear-cut good or bad answer.\n-Characters and how they react to what you do!\n-Your party cast, and the relationship bar!\n-Manageable AI tactics for your party!\n-Harder difficulties are brutally challenging.\n-You can wrangle nugs!\n\nCons:\n-A few glitches/bugs.  Nothing that ruins your gaming experience for more than a few moments.\n-The lack of sun you'll be getting isn't good for your complexion.\n-After playing this Dragon Age 2 is a big let-down. :(\n\nMy rating of course, is a 10/10!  While there are a few bugs and glitches, they aren't so notable that it ruins your gaming experience more than just a few minute, if that.  The story is just phenominal!  The game is challenging, on the harder difficulties each battle you win feels like an achievement, and you find yourself stocking up and using everything you have on boss battles, most of the time narrowly making it through.  This game is a must play if you haven't already!","November 1, 2014","true","67.9"," 349 of 361 people (97%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","97","349","361","20","9"

Crafted by the same studio that has made some of my favorite RPGs of all time, Dragon Age answers the question of whether or not Bioware can create a compelling medieval fantasy RPG that isn't D&D based. The answer is a resounding yes. While containing many of the trappings of past RPGs like Neverwinter Nights and Baldur's Gate, Dragon Age works its own magic by offering three classes that can be customized by an almost infinite amount, six different origin stories for the player character, and doing away with the traditional good/evil morality mechanic in favor of one based on individual party approval or disapproval of your actions.\n\nEach character in your party is believable and compelling, likeable for different reasons, and some can be romanced or change their outlook depending on how the story progresses. Every major questline can have different outcomes depending on player choices and it's this feeling of agency in the world that keeps the replay value in this game. Dragon Age has often been called a dark RPG and rightly so, as the story is much less straight forward than a typical RPG. Often you will find yourself having to deal with choices where there is no clear cut "good" or "evil" outcome which is part of why player choice feels so meaningful.\n\nAnd on top of all that, the game is a lot of fun. I remember the first time playing this game and saying "this is the game that Neverwinter Nights 2 should have been!" It still holds up, probably even more so against its sequel which in some ways is unfortunate. If you love western RPGs and loved the past work of Bioware, you will love this game. I give it two severed darkspawn thumbs way up!","June 19, 2014","true","111.7"," 283 of 294 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","283","294","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skyforsense/recommended/47810/","Skyforsense","Skyforsense","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skyforsense/","283 products in account","Dragon Age: Origins, debatably the last good game of Bioware's making, is a very intricate and detailed, although at sometimes cliche, foray into an action-adventure medieval setting.\n\nGameplay - Personally, this was my favorite part of the game. I loved the real time with pause system, and always have with other games such as KOTOR. My only complaint is that melee and ranged did not seem to shine as well as the magic system, especially with mana versus stamina. Often, I played as Morrigan instead of the Warden just because it was much more fun. The tactics system is well-done but the AI could use some more work, especially with rogues - even though they were supposed to go behind enemies for backstabs, more often than not, I had to do it myself. I feel as though the wide amount of abilities would easily allow for a just-as-fun second or third playthrough.\n\nStory - The overarching storyline of the Blight was predictable, but I feel as though the game shines in the whole adventure there (as you don't "directly" deal with the blight until the ending) was much better. The characters involved in the story were well-written and the many dialogue options involved with most major NPCs was refreshing, although expected of Bioware's team. One of my favorite parts of the game related to story was the lore behind the whole games. As a TES fan, especially Morrowind, I really enjoyed the codex and each of its entries. The Fade was a unique concept which, although tedious in-game, was a great concept and a take on the supernatural that I hadn't seen in any game.\n\nCharacters - I should preface this by saying that my main party consisted of myself, a human noble, Morrigan, Sten, and Shale. I opted for Shale instead of a vanilla character simply because I wanted a tank in my party. I tried to talk to each character a lot individually though, besides the secret companion, who I opted to not join my party. I romanced Zevran and Alistair (in order to take the throne) and felt that the amount of dialogue options and their own quests were really well-done. My advice for the game, if you want to be much more into the story and characters, is to set it to easy/normal and play with whom you like.\n\nThat about wraps it up. You can easily spend 50 hours in a single play-through if you do more of the quests than I did, such as the rogue mage group, chantry quests, and each of the unique quests that your party members give you (Sten's sword, Flemeth, etc). It's very worth your time.","November 25, 2013","true","55.9"," 625 of 715 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","625","715","0","2"

The biggest downside to the game is the story is tried, tired and done a thousand times over.  You the hero are on quest to destroy the dark spawn that is wreaking havoc on the land.  This being its biggest downfall does not make this a bad game at all.  I had over 70hours in one play through and with all the decision making you encounter this game will surely keep you amused for multiple plays.  One of the best combat systems I've seen  you can not only setup the AI to have your companions on the quest do what you like but you can fully take control of them which in my opinion is a huge advantage.  The combat system is a little bit of learning curve but once you get the hang of it you will love it and enjoy the simpleness of how your characters act and follow your directions in the heat of some best battles you will see in an RPG.  Bioware did an excellent job in creating a game you can fully plunge yourself into and get behind.","February 15, 2014","true","71.0"," 209 of 226 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","209","226","0","0"

[deaf]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NG-Allison/","276 products in account","Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing\nOverall Rating: 9/10\nGameplay Rating: 9/10\nAccessibility Rating: 8/10\n\nOverall rating is a combination of the gameplay (mechanics and story) and accessibility (how the game includes deaf/hoh gamers).\n\nOverall GameplayDA:O's game format is very much in line with similar games by Bioware, ranging from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic I/II, Mass Effect, etc.  If you're familiar with those games, you will understand the controls of this game.  If you haven't experienced those games, I would suggest each of them in addition to the Dragon Age line.\n\nThese tend to be very story-rich games, and DA:O is no exception.  Starting out, you create a character in a very scaled-back Dungeons and Dragons format.  You decide between male/female, elf/human/dwarf, and warrior/mage/rogue.  As you progress, there are further specializations you can pick up, such as a rogue bard or a mage healer.\n\nAt almost 30 hours of play, I am around 15-20% complete with the main storyline, so there's significant play time for the cost of the game.  Further, replay value comes from different character types, gender, and race, as well as modified slightly by the abilities of your character, such as intimidation or persuasion abilities.\n\nI am enjoying this game and will continue to play it beyond one playthrough.\n\nGeneral AccessibilityDA:O primarily uses QWES to strafe/move and A/D to turn the camera.  I tend to hold right click to manipulate the camera and just use W to run forward.  The complexity of games like this require more keyboard use than an FPS, so different windows, HUDs, and menus can be accessed by various keys.  All keys can be rebound, making it a little more convenient for mobility-related issues.\n\nIn line with all games of this type from Bioware, the combat in the game can be paused so that you can issue orders to your party members.  In combat, you can pause as often as you need to, which helps balance the game experience out for all gamers, regardless of needs.\n\nSubtitles & CaptionsSpeech is captioned in this game.  Important text is captioned so that you can read it readily and up-front and ambient speech (such as NPCs or banter between supporting characters in your party) shows up over their heads and can be read as you do other things.  Captions do not use color-coding, but conversations happen sequentially rather than simultaneously, and display the character on screen so you know who is talking.\n\nOne complaint is that these background conversations, captions may be missed entirely, depending on the camera angles.  These are usually interesting or funny conversations that help develop the characters and their relationships, but, more than once, I have only caught the end of them.  Part of the draw of games like this is getting immersed in the environment, but this is hard to do when the mechanics of the game do not permit it.\n\nThere is nothing in the game that requires being able to hear or hear well that I am aware of.\n\nChatting/CommunicatingDA:O is single-player.\n\nNo rating.","December 19, 2014","true","26.9"," 120 of 122 people (98%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","98","120","122","4","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/60Frames/recommended/47810/","60Frames","Fabi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/60Frames/","240 products in account","“Dragon Age: Origins is simply one of those games you have to play no matter if you like that genre or not."\nTL;DR:  Buy it. Please.\n\nNote: This review doesn’t contain any spoiler. I did in fact play the DLC, but this Review only focuses on the main game.\n\nFeel free to add me on Steam, if you have questions about DA:O!\nGraphic 7/10 I guess that’s the weakest aspect of DA:O, and it still is better than many games of that genre. Animations are quite okay, nothing fancy here, but the atmosphere of the game is unbelievable. You’ve ever dreamt of a battlefield that actually looks like one? Here you have it. Even though you’ll come along some weird animations, bad textures and some bugs (typically for such huge games), you won’t be disappointed. It’s still beautiful.\n\nSound 10/10 You may can say that it’s not the best looking game, but you can’t argue with me that it doesn’t sound awesome. First things first: Yes, every character is voiced and every actor did a pretty good job. I couldn’t remember any bad one. The background music is excellent. You’ll immediately fall in love with it. I could list 100 things about the sound part, but I guess a 10/10 stands for itself.\n\nStory: 9/10 Story is always a hard one to judge. It’s often personal preference if you like it or not. If you see the deeper meanings or if you actually care about the background of everyone around you. The story is damn well presented and is overall superb. If you break it down it in fact would come down of being just another “We got invaded by some f*cking weird boss monster and you have to save the world bla bla” and even if it may look like it is just that, it really is more. Just explore it on your own and you’ll see how good it actually is, if you just spend enough time.\n\nGameplay: 10/10 Let me give you a little bit of a backstory here for all of you undecided ones: I NEVER played a round-based game before DA:O and I had my reasons for it. I always thought it’s boring, repetitive and focuses too much on that strategy part instead of action. Oh boy was I proved wrong. It was so easy to get into that game but you had so many features to find your style of playing. I don’t even know what I should tell you first about. You can create your own little party by choosing which companions will accompany you throughout the game. You’ll meet most of them during the game and you can interact with them to the fullest. And I mean to the fullest. (You can date almost all of them.) In conversations you can choose which answer is the most suitable. But be careful: You can even loose the chance to recruit a companion if you chose to just not let him / her come with you, kill him / her or you just forgot to complete that one quest. If you ever wanted to try out a Game like this, do it. It’s the best by far.\n\nDifficulty: 4 up to 9 As I said before: It introduces you quite well and I as a beginner never felt overwhelmed. There are many difficulty levels to choose and the hardest one is just pure pain. And that’s the way it should be. For my first playthrough I chose “Easy” and there were still some hard fights that require you to pause (By pressing spacebar) and think through your strategy. It’s for everyone.  I really recommend reading some class guides (There are a lot on youtube if you’re too lazy to read like me)!!  Only the DLC gives you the option to reskill. Or you have to download the mod.\n\nNotable: - I won’t say that there aren’t some bugs. You can’t expect a game this big without some minor bugs. But there wasn’t a single game braking one.\n- Good for newcomers to the genre\n- Runs smoothly\n- Complete Edition costs less than 10 bucks on Sale.\n- I completed it in around 70 hours. (And another 20 spent on the DLCs). You WILL spent a lot of time in this\n-  One of THE best games I’ve ever played so far\n\nConclusion: I BEG you to at least try it out. I didn’t like those games too, but DA:O changed my mind and became my favorite game. You won’t regret it!\n\nThanks for reading, if there are any questions leave a comment below. Feel free to add me if you want to chat about the game, my other reviews or just for fun.

One of my all time favorites. Still, I'll be honest and list the flaws. First, the level editor is nowhere near as intuitive as Neverwinter Nights, but given that these days a prepackaged editor is rare enough as is, I suppose I shouldn't complain. Awakenings is buggy as hell and Witch Hunt is far too short, although I rather liked Ariane and Finn as companions. The "hard choice" at the end of Origins feels contrived to me, although I can't really get into why without spoilers. For what it's worth, I highly recommend the Dragon Age Redesigned and Improved Atmosphere mods. Also, there is a mod avaliable to skip the Fade. You'll probably want to install that after the first playthrough.\n\nStill an excellent game, and you should buy it before Dragon Age Inquisition comes out.

The PC version is a blink of an eye compared to my PS3 sounding like it was ready to take flight playing this with load times becoming increasingly annoying as you play through it.\n\nThe graphics and performance overall are far superior as well and the mouse/keyboard controls are nice. It does take a little bit of getting used to rotating the look with either the keyboard, or the mouse (you have to hold down the right button to look around), but you get used to it fast enough. Not to mention the ability to quicksave and not wait 5 seconds like on consoles.\n\nAs for the game itself, this is one of my all-time favorite RPGs. Mostly because I love the adult and mature content that it provides with the characters. No I'm not talkinng about sex, although you can hook up with other characters in your party and even have some grand old same sex encounters. The dialogue and writing in this game feels very realistic and not childish like most RPGs you will play. A lot of good dark humor as well as some smart interactions with the characters. This is what I love most about this series and what I loave about Bioware games in general like Mass Effect.\n\nIt is fun to mix and match your party as you walk around exploring as they all talk to each other while you walk and have different things to say based on who is in the group.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to ALL RPG fans and would suggest buying the Ultimate Edition so that you can get all the DLC on Steam without the hassle of having to go through the Bioware website and getting shafted. The DLC is worth the few extra bucks for a completely new character (got this as a pre-order on PS3 I believe) that adds a lot of humor and their own character quests to the game.\n\nThe story is farily well done and has a lot of character quests like most Bioware games that addsdepth to your party. The DLCs expand on some of them and add even more story. Plus you get new items, skills, and characters that can be used in the main campaign.\n\nThe PC version also offers a decent modding community which can add a lot to the game, or take away some of the tedious things you dislike.\n\nThis game for me is an easy 9.5/10.","December 11, 2013","true","51.1"," 120 of 130 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","120","130","0","9"

Several vastly different endings depending on choices made through the game. Fantastic and witty dialogue with all your companions that you were able to take with you on your adventure. Interactions between the companions that you had with you at random event places. Love scenes with characters that you had started to have a relationship with .... which needed to be be done slowly and well over a long time being aware of three way jealousies and confrontations with other companions.... Brilliantly worked out!\n\nMassive Boss battles ... an AI system where you could set up how your companions would automatically react when certain conditions are met. Tough battles that you needed to be strategic about to survive... with a combination of four possible followers fighting with you and needing all the skills of magic, rogue and fighter to make it past all areas.\n\nDA Origins had an expansion called Awakening to which you could take a save file from Origins to take you into it ... and you needed to as the enemies in Awakening were at that level and a new game started at awakening started with the same gear you would have had in Origins. So anyone wanting to battle level 30 enemies with a rusty dagger and a robe.... good luck.\n\nThe Awakening was a good addition a couple of your companions made the trip and could join you if you did all the right things. Certainly it is a smaller game than origins and a different one. But a worthy addition using the same game structure and similar dialogue ... although not as good as origins.\n\nThe Dragon Age 2 game actually doesn't really have anything to do with the first. Some of the lore is the same ... and from some of the decisions you made in DA O will be represented in some vague background stories. The dialogue was tweaked further but is became convoluted  ... but none of the characters really felt like someone I could relate to.\nDA 2 had three chapters I completed the first and after 5 -6 tries eventually defeated the massive boss battle in the deep roads against the ARW (Ancient Rock Wraith) This battle was immense!\n\nFor that the resulting Treasure was a major Disappointment!!!! I had played as a mage up to that point and the robe in the treasure wasn't much different than anything previously. The only character who had decent armor was the dwarf (narrator of the game when cut scenes happened)  who's Armor leveled as he did ... so you would think this dwarf was the protagonist. Then you supposedly won a massive income from your trip into the deep roads such that you bought a house for your self and your companions ... (that I didn't care about) but had no money left, to even buy potions.\n\nThe only part of DA 2  that I did like was the combat! How they had you fight numerous enemies and the way spells and melee attacks worked was great. But hopeless story and characters that I couldn't care about .... and nothing to do with DA Origins at all very disappointing.","May 19, 2015","true","218.7"," 101 of 108 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","101","108","4","3"

The story is rich and even is presented to you differently throughout the game depending on your "Origin Story" and choices you've made in the game. The character's all have interesting back-stories and will behave in meaningful ways, depending on your relationship with the character. Even the most boring character for me, Sten, was still interesting enough that talking to him about his past and race's history didn't feel like a chore. Combat is simple enough, and while it doesn't have the same level of involvement or 'Flare' as some other games, it's strategic and satisfying. Graphics are pretty good, and with mods and a decent computer, you can really improve the atmosphere of the game.\n\nThe amount of content is impressive, even by RPG standards. I got roughly 60-some hours on one play-through, and I didn't even bother to complete all the quests. While on that topic, side-quests in this game are well-done as well. Each side-quest usually has some kind of back story, and more often than not, rewards you with some kind of armor or weapon that you couldn't find in the vendor stores. One of my favorite side-quests (and I'll try not to spoil it) is when you battle several different Revents, or Corrupted Warrior Spirits, toretrieve this bass-♥♥♥ armor set called the Juggernuat. The rewards and backstory of the quests made it feel like it somehow tied into the actual story, making it much less painful for those 100% completionists.\n\nDragon Age Origins is one of Bioware's best works (my personal favorite), and makes me wish Mass Effect took more from Dragon Age in terms of storytelling and interesting quests. If you're a Bioware fan, RPG fan, or even just looking for a good game to get immersed in, look no further... Dragon Age is worth wasting hours of your life away.\n","November 12, 2014","true","128.5"," 93 of 97 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","93","97","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/47810/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Dragon Age: Origins is old-school. Before achievements and trophies, a role-player's greatest achievement was working the system to build the most broken, overpowered character possible within the constraints of whatever edition of Dungeons & Dragons the game was based on. Origins is a solitary experience; you'll isolate yourself from the outside world, staying up nights and well into the morning because when this game grabs you, it simply won't let go.\n\nThis is a game that's been in development for what seems like forever, and it shows. BioWare's own Mass Effect was far more visually impressive, particularly in the dialogue sequences, where Dragon Age's facial animations and character models can seem stiff and wooden. Then there's the odd decision to go so over-the-top with the blood. Blood plays an important role in the world's unique fiction, but watching your characters relay meaningful lines of speech while splashed with more blood than the prom scene in "Carrie" borders on the ridiculous, robbing such scenes of any potential sense of gravitas.\n\nThat isn't to say that this is an ugly game, by any means. Dragon Age: Origins' landscapes and dungeon interiors are rife with detail and a joy to explore. Combat animations in particular are impressive, as your characters will set themselves before enemies and go through complex motions, with rogues jockeying for position to backstab and warriors forcefully slamming their shields into faces. Colorful kill animations result in dismemberments and decapitations, rewarding you for critical strikes in a far more memorable manner than just a bigger damage number. Then there's the sheer scale of this undertaking. You can easily log a hundred hours exploring every inch of this world, with plenty of incentive to come back again to approach the tale of the Grey Warden from a new perspective and origin story.\n\nYour character's origin story, the first steps in your adventure, plays a significant role in how this tale plays out. The tropes of fantasy fiction lie intact, with Dwarves dwelling underground and elves living in the world's forests on the outskirts of human civilization, but these societies are still fleshed-out and made unique. Dwarves have a complex caste system, with the nobility focusing on political advancement while the casteless underclass live in ghettos, struggling to eke out a living as part of the criminal underbelly. Elves who live in human cities reside in closed-off alienages, destined for a life of servitude to the human nobility. Magi live secluded lives of research and study in their towers under the constant watch of the order of Templars, a religious sect tasked with ensuring that magic does not lead to demonic infestation.\n\nWhile your own story is important, the companions that join you play an equally important role. The Grey Warden Alistair, the witch of the wilds Morrigan, and the mysterious minstrel Leliana are your primary romantic options and the game's main supporting characters, though other characters like Sten, the taciturn warrior, are nearly as interesting. Even the dog companion is a full-fledged ally worthy of bringing along, complete with his own inventory and unique abilities. The quality of the voice work ensures that you'll rarely skip through the frequent conversations and inter-party banter. You'll spend lots of time wading through interminably long conversations while getting to know the members of your party, in an effort to improve their approval ratings.\n\nFans of Dungeons & Dragons-styled role-playing adventures may be annoyed that there are only three core character classes and three race options, but there's remarkable depth to the character development system. Each class has a variety of talent options, and four specializations to choose from: Warriors can go weapon and shield or two-handed, Rogues can become archers or dual-wield, and Mages can master a wide variety of spell options. Dragon Age: Origins also provides countless opportunities for challenging, riveting combat sequences where strategy and tactics win out.\n\nAgain, it's the decisions that make Dragon Age: Origins such a thought-provoking experience. I've played through the game twice now and I still have trouble choosing which companions to take with me on any given adventure. The story has a way of dropping situations in your lap where any of a handful of different options seem viable, with no clear-cut option standing out as the right one. This is due in part to Dragon Age: Origins' lack of a clearly defined moral alignment structure. Characters are generally complex, defying the unrealistically simplistic labels of "good" and "evil," and the game is the better for it.\n\nThere is so much more to Dragon Age: Origins I just don't have room to explain here. Simply know that there are tons of weapons and loot to find, craft, and coat with poison, thousands of quests to take on, storekeepers to intimidate, and NPCs to persuade. If you're a Western-style, fantasy RPG nut, or if you love a great tactical challenge, you simply can't go wrong with Dragon Age: Origins. BioWare has outdone itself once again.","January 23","true","91.5"," 91 of 95 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","91","95","5","1"

Suffice it to say, I was pretty excited to give it a run. I went from being  sorely dissapointed  to  becoming a big fan , so I thought it would be helpful to share my experience.  Note: I haven't finished the game or all of the DLC's yet, so this is a tentative review.\n\nEarly impressions\nGraphics sucked (even with beautification mods), combat was okay but certainly not "tactical", what the hell is this?\n\nI kept coming back to the game because, a) I heard so much about it, and b)  every quest has a really well developed narrative to it . Even in what would typically be fetch quests I was invested in participating because I knew the back-story (i.e. You meet a kid who's mother died, and find a quest on the notice board to locate her remains and bring back her amulet, presumably for the kid). It could have been "kill three sewer rats and report to the tavern", but it wasn't and that was amazing.\n\nAlso, right off the start, you're thrown into a pretty epic story.\n\nMid-game impressions\nAfter 20 hours in-game, your combat abilities are more fleshed out. Combat begins to feel  a lot  more tactical, because you have several variations in taking on enemies, and you need to use several abilities to win against increasingly difficult foes.\n\nSeveral quests really stand out relative to other RPG's, for instance when I -  begin spoiler -sacrificed an heir-to-the-throne kid's mother so that I could travel to a soul-realm, to battle a demon that was possessing him - making the kid murder people and summon monsters to kill townsfolk - using an outlawed form of magic through a guy I just busted out of a dungeon (because he MAY or MAY NOT have attempted to kill the kids dad/lord), - end spoiler - I was like, damn that was amazing.\n\nLittle things in this world really come to the fore when you invest the time into it. Certain weapons have entire histories associated with them; codex entries come together to paint a really worth-while narrative picture. Also, you meet a pretty sizable list of interesting characters along your journey.\n\nLate-game impressions\nNot there yet, but I'm sure I will be.\n\nTL;DR\nThis is an excellent RPG.\n\nPros\n\n+ Awesome writing, even for simple quests\n+ Interesting history to discover\n+ Epic story\n+ Interesting characters throughout\n+ Decent mod support (but they do not help the dated graphics issue that much)\n\nCons\n\n- Graphics are poor, but are sometimes really well done (inconsistent graphic quality?)\n- Takes a long time before combat is tactically engaging","June 8, 2015","true","47.6"," 106 of 116 people (91%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","91","106","116","9","4"

If you like plunging yourself into truly epic RPGs which can keep you glued to your computer for days on end, this is one of the best games to play.\n\nRight from the start, the massiveness of the game assaults you. Making your standard start-of-an-RPG choices of character race and class will determine which of six origin stories you will play through to open the game.  Each of these stories can take several hours to beat.  And if you are like me, you will need to play them all before deciding which character you will anoint the chosen one which you will play as for the entirety of the campaign.  Who you choose will also affect certain conversations and quests in the main part of the game.\n\nContinuing with the theme of massiveness, the narrative and lore elements are truly epic and expansive. The main narrative is well written with great pacing, telling an interesting tale rooted in classic fantasy themes. The characters are diverse and interesting, and each one is given an actual presence in the world. And if you enjoy immersing yourself in the nuances of fantasy gameworlds, you will be pleased to know there is a plethora of lore and backstory. There is so much to learn about.\n\nAs for the gameworld: it is atmospheric and mystical. There is no gigantic overworld to freely traverse, however. But the locations that do exist are very well designed and are expressive of the setting. And the graphics succeed in painting the picture that is intended, even if they may fall behind the curve as this game begins to age.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics and the battle system are intricate and elaborate. On the higher difficulties, deep knowledge of interactive effects is necessary for tough battles. Luckily on the lower difficulties, you can get away with only a rudimentary understanding. But as you unlock new abilities and new characters who offer new playable classes, experimenting with different party combinations can help spice up the combat. For any game that lasts over 100 hours, that can be a welcome feature.\n\nOne of the headlining concepts at the heart of Dragon Age: Origins is the decision system. I alluded to this earlier when I mentioned the diverse origin stories. There are a multitude of decisions to be made throughout the game, most of which have some sort of impact on the gameworld— be it large or small. And to make it better, most of the decisions have no clear “right or wrong,” so you’ll really have to make choices (and not just choose what you know the game wants you to).\n\nIt is beginning to age, but true quality cannot easily be eroded by the sands of time. If you are a fan of truly epic RPGs, this one is a must-play for you. My only warning is that it is quite verbose and grand in scale, so if you are someone who easily loses interest then you may struggle with the sheer magnitude of the game.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","April 18","true","101.3"," 94 of 100 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","94","100","2","5"

BioWare certainly knows how to pull off a good RPG, they are clearly not afraid to implement whatever they please to make it a superb experience. Dragon Age: Origins is no different. The game is set in the fantasy world known as Ferelden. A land that for long has been safe from war and suffering and looks like your typical fantasy land with elves, dwarves, wizards, maidens and of course - Dragons.\n\nThe peace is not to last though, peace is a pretty bad setting to make a game in to be honest. A dark force gathers in the outskirts of the Kingdom and soon the faith of humanity (or what species have you) solely rests on your shoulders. In other words - like every single damn fantasy RPG out there. But hold your unicorns, that does not mean the game is bad does it? No! Making a game in the stereotypical RPG/Fantasy is never a bad thing. As long as it's up to standard with implemented unique features that successfully intertwine with a very good story.\n\nBioWare themselves described the game as the spritual successor to Baldur's Gate, at least in the sense of the atmosphere and game setting. I have not played Baldur's Gate, so I can not answer to this. I can however say that the game reminds A lot of Mass Effect and Star Wars: KoTOR, combine that with the general fantasy setting (like Skyrim), some intriguing story and this game is set to blow your brains out.\n\nMy experience with this game has sadly been... shattered, though. I have throughout the years seriously tried to set my mind on RPG-mode, and just sink myself into this adventure. But I have only finished the game once, and have probably played the start 10 times. I am attracted by the setting and gameplay, but I always seem to end up forcing myself through the game, because I feel that the game MUST be good. Unlike with Mass Effect or any of the Elder Scrolls games for example, I pretty much ended up disliking the game because of my issue. I had the same problem with Bioshock, but this is just me, so it does not make the game any less good. You just have to crave for some RPG goodness, and not rush through it.\n\nJust like most BioWare games, you are but one character in a squad/company, and most of the gameplay are dependent on this as a strategic mechanic. It is possible to just ignore the other characters in your company, but this would require your main character to completely carry every fight, which is not optimal. Again, as with all Fantasy RPGs, you get to pick a class; Warrior, Mage or Rogue and build your character from scratch. In Dragon Age you also get to pick race and background, giving even more options as well as unlocking different storylines. This is to make every playthrough a unique experience compared to the previous. Overall BioWare are known as masters at extensive and complex dialogues for their games, often to make you choose a dark or bright path and reflect your options into the upcoming events.\n\nWhat I however Did enjoy about the game was the enormous background history to build the series on, the grim setting, the interactions between the main character and NPC characters, some adult scenery and romance interactions, the depiction of cracks in a fictional society that may or may not be referring to real life scenarios. As the majority of this game attract me I feel that it deserves a positive rating, even though I will probably not play it again due to lack of patience and time.\n\nIf you love BioWare's games, Fantasy RPG's and are ready to sacrifice dozens of hours for a grand adventure, then this game is likely to entertain.","January 17, 2014","true","55.8"," 84 of 97 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","84","97","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PlatinumClient/recommended/47810/","PlatinumClient","PlatinumClient","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PlatinumClient/","106 products in account","WARNING VERY LONG\nI suppose I should write a review, since Inquisition's story has finally ended, now begins my watch, for the next Dragon Age game.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nDragon Age Origins was first released by in 2009 and was met with great acclaim, for its fantastic world design, setting, story, basically it was one the best RPG games of the decade, i say "one of" and not "the" mind you. Being released between both fallout 3 and new vegas, Dragon age had some considerable competition. Luckily it hold its own and more, with great storytelling, characters and some great gameplay.\n\nIt definitely was not the prettiest game at the time, I mean the character looks can be anywhere from pretty and handsome in rare cases almost exclusive to companions, to plain old ugly appearances. There isn't much variety in customization, armours are simple recolours for the most part, weapons and bows too. Honestly the looks are definitely one of the worst parts of the game, just too little uniqueness in armour and weapons to make you and you party stand out from any other ordinary grunt, unless of course you enjoy that sort of thing.\n\nSTORY\nI’ll try not to spoil too much, as many choices affect not situations and the ending in this game but also in the sequels too.\n\nYou will have an origin story, by choosing your race and birthplace, either being, human, elf or dwarf, and being birthed in the slums, nobility or mage. Oh and the singled out dalish elf. Each of these will affect some dialogue options and give racial traits, it can also make some things easier or harder depending on the quest at hand. With these picked you will take part in a battle as a soldier in the Grey Wardens, an ancient order of protectors whose sole purpose is to defend life against the darkspawn and blights.\n\nAfter the being defeated at the battle you find out you're one of the last surviving members of the order, and is up to you to gather allies for a new army for one last battle, or the spawn will overtake all of thedas. Thus begins the main quest, along the way you will help out random strangers, groups of mages and mercs, decide the fate of magical order and dalish clan, find a lost piece of ancient dwarven history and find the remains of the bride to the Maker, the creator of life in the known world.\n\nSo this is a huge story with many quests and side jobs, they can be incredibly drawn out each main segments easily takes out a hour or more depending on difficulty. But you use this time to stockpile potions and arrows, find the best weapons and armour for each of your 9 companions, all find additional support for your army. All of it eventually paying off in the epic finale at the end of the game were it all comes into play. This is one of the main reasons why this game is so great still stands today, as a great piece of storytelling.\n\n\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe game play likes a old fashioned RPG, where you will control a party of characters assign specialties and classed, equip them as well. So it mostly strategy based combat, assigning orders, positioning, setting priorities and tactics and more. Alongside this combat is alose magic and consumables which also affect your allies if they are caught in in it area of effect making for carefully planned attacks. Through your character's skills, you can buff and debuff units, effectively controlling the battlefield. It is very difficulty explaining it completely, but such examples can very easily be found online, or if you have played it's much like Baldur's Gate.\n\nDIFFICULTY\nThis is another main great point of the game, it is naturally hard, even on the easiest difficulty. The game will often throw a number of enemies at you either being a small horde of easily dispatchable grunts, to a mini boss or two, as well as mix of troops. Magic is also your worst enemy as if left unchecked a mage will destroy your team single handley.\n\nAs for the difficulty settings, it changes it artificially, increasing unit health, damage and defence, as well affecting certain other stats.  But despite all of this, even on easy there is plenty of leeway in how you can build your characters, but as you go up you will have to plan your builds accordingly or suffer a painful, live die and repeat scenarios.\n\nCOMPANIONS\nI feel like I should bring these in as if you get into the game, you become invested in their story, to the point like many other people, you consider them Friends/Family for you Warden. Here's two examples of my favourite ones. Leliana, she's an assassin  Bard turned religious sister. She's confident but sweet, very calm and has an interesting backstory and quest to boot as well has her own origin DLC story, where you can gain a an amazing set of armour for you or her.My second is a dwarf warrior exilce called ohgren, hes allways drunk and allways randy, constantly trying to get it on with your female compainons or you, and trys and excuse to talk about the dirty stuff.\n\nThere 8 of them in total, 3 Warriors, 2 rogues and 2 mages and a dog, there is also a unique dlc companion who is a stone golem, and is very interesting one at that. Also depending on your game choices you can get another warrior to join your party at the expense of another.  These characters are lovable and hateable in their own ways, each can be customized and leveled individually, each have their own speciality for combat. Through combat they can sustain injuries and if not treated or treated, will lead to their eventual death. Doing they don't like too much, or do something that goes completely against them, will make either leave or attack you.\n\nThey all have extensive dialogue and backstory each will have their own personal quests that will give them bonuses or special weapons and/or armour. If you take an interest in them and start improving their approval of you, they will get bonus their base skills like constitution furthering a specialty.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOkay the graphics aren't great, the environments are vast and empty ,customization is limited, overall game is difficult and has many unpatched bug that can break quests. But this is a tiny proportion to what you’re getting, a huge world of fantasy, filled with a few hours worth history reading, rememberable characters, epic story and potentially almost a hundred hours worth of fun. There are many little thing I haven't mentioned yet, like how there is a modding community, DLC’s offer post game content, that will give rewards for your next playthrough, how actions caused here will affect many details of the next game, and the actions of the sequel will affect the sequel-sequel.\n\nThis is definitely worth a look at the very least, or even just a read of the timeline or sotries embedded within the game.","November 12, 2015","true","198.2"," 43 of 50 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","43","50","0","1"

The locations have a nice amount of detail and all feel unique. The music is great and the voice acting ranges from solid to excellent.\n\nThe story will drag you in and give you many choices. There is a lot of flavour text to read and you can easily spend a couple of hours just wading through optional dialogue. There are also weaker quests and predictable subplots, but overall the story is good.\n\nNow to the not so good things: The combat system isn't bad, but you'll struggle with it quite often due to it being kind of delayed. Which in harder fights were every second counts can be very annoying. The game isn't overly hard, but there are fights that will really drain your patience because they aren't exactly well balanced.\n\nNext problem is the design of especially the later dungeons in the game. They are just stretched out way too much and filled with pointless time and resource consuming fights. In combination with the subpar combat system it's tedious to push through them.\n\nLastly I have to say that the setting couldn't be more generic. There's nothing in this game that you haven't seen before (maybe except for some demons), but overall it feels like the team had a lot of ideas about the story, but none about the background. This is just a minor complaint though.\n\nI recommend the game, but mainly if you enjoy the story in a game more than actual gameplay.\n\nEdit: I just finished the expansion (The Awakening) and found it important to add a few lines about it as well. One complain about the main game was that it wasn't original enough in terms of setting and I have to say that this expansion really does a good job at correcting that mistake. It's nowhere as obvious what's going on as in the main game and there are unique non-human villains this time. Also due to the shorter nature of the expansion the dungeons don't drag as much as in the main game. I really enjoyed the expansion and would even go as far as saying that it's slightly better than the main game. This is more about the overall gameplay and not about the story. If you want to play the game you should really get the ultimate edition to get the full experience.","June 25, 2015","true","70.3"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","36","42","3","4"

The Origin story system allows you to create characters that feel unique every time, and make every playthrough completely different. The interactions between your character and your companions are incredibly complex and engaging, and allow you to really develop your character's personality. The storyline is very long yet entertaining, and gives you many options as to how to proceed through and eventually complete the game. Often times, there is no right decision, and your actions will have far reaching consequences, and will also affect your companions' opinion of you.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it is different to many RPGs in that it is very strategy based, and when playing on Normal or harder, you will have to actively manage all four members of your party in order to succeed. The combat can be very punishing and is perhaps too difficult, especially early in the game. Warriors, the front line of your party, will die very quickly without high stats and equipment. However, if you use your party's abilities well, and make good decisions as to which abilities you unlock, you should be alright.\n\nThe game is open world, though to travel between areas, you must watch your progress on a map. The textures of the NPCs are good enough that they don't affect immersion, yet many of the textures of the environment are rather low-res. However, the game is pretty old now so that is only to be expected. I did not find that it took away from my role-playing experience. The voice-acting is superb, and while like most games you get used to the same voice actors, each NPC does seem slightly different.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anyone, and putting in the hours to beat the storyline is extremely rewarding. The various expansions provide a significant late game, or you could just make a totally new character! Even after two playthroughs, the game says I have only completed 54% of the content.

It is easily the best $30 I have ever spent. The characters are memorable, the story line is engaging and the atmosephere is spot on. I have played the game through on multiple occasions on multiple difficulty settings and I can honestly say that I hated going through the Deep Roads every time. I will admit, some of the DLC's are overpowered. Some of the gear you can get make the game laughable but still rewarding. Most of the gear cannot be obtained without compelting different achivements in Lilliana's Song, Darkspawn Chronicles and Golems Amgarrak. All of these give you different rewards for being a completionist. The majority of the dlc released (those listed above) including Witch Hunt are different campagines that do not effect the main story. I'm going to stop here, because if I don't i'm going to end up spoiling the game and you would be reading an eight page article and not a review. Here's my advice, buy the Ultimate Edition if you can, it's $10 more than the base game and you will get EVERYTHING. Each DLC adds 5-20 hours of addition game play to an already 100+ hour game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/idreamofelectricsheep/recommended/47810/","idreamofelectricsheep","Master of Reality","http://steamcommunity.com/id/idreamofelectricsheep/","219 products in account","So in 2009, Bioware decided to return to its roots of making RPGs in the vein of Baldur's Gate with Dragon Age: Origins. What resulted is a very engaging and thrilling tale of a band of misfits that come together to defeat the evil Darkspawn and their leader, the Archdemon. I wholeheartedly can recommend it.\n\nThe story of Dragon Age is a pretty good one, with a good mix of political intrigue and dark fantasy themes. There is some really expansive lore in this game available for you to read in the codex, which would take you hours to read. I assure you, however, that reading all of it is worth it.\n\nThe party members are all unique characters, and well-written. Some would say a few are weaker than others as far as being interesting (looking at you, Sten), but they all have decent backstories and are really fun to hear banter between each other. That's another thing; the party banter is hilarious and worth stopping to listen to.\n\nThe combat in this game is beyond thrilling. You can pause combat at any time to issue orders to your four-member party, and after unpausing they will act out the order. You can play the game either in third-person or an isometric view. I prefer the isometric for tactical reasons and for that classic Baldur's Gate/Planescape feel. You can also set up tactics for your party members so that they will use certain items/abilities when a condition is met. This can get as in-depth as you like, and its one of the coolest features of the game in my humble opinion.\n\nGraphically, the game doesn't look too bad for how old it is already, but there are texture mods to spice it up, if you're interested. Be aware, however, that this could cause stuterring due to the game engine not really liking textures being TOO large. Otherwise, the graphics are servicable, but nothing to write home about. I don't really care about them, but its up to you to decide whether or not they bother you.\n\ntl;dr Dragon Age: Origins is a return to form for Bioware RPGs and a great 100-or-so-hour romp for RPG nerds like myself. Buy it if you want to experience one of the better games to come out in recent years. Its worth it. Good story, good characters, great game.","December 22, 2014","true","144.0"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lesalanos/recommended/47810/","lesalanos","Trip Hazard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lesalanos/","382 products in account","It’s not easy always being at the cutting edge, and that’s why I’ve decided to review this Dragon Age game, and not the new one which people are currently interested in.\n\nDA:O is a few years old now, but it has taken a few attempts for me to actually stick with it, and it with me. Hence, tardy review. But, let me be clear, right off the bat. It’s as good as everybody said it was, all those years ago! Sure, it has a somewhat off-putting generic fantasy shell, and the designers needn’t have limited themselves to just four colours (brown, grey, green, and reddish-brown) when they were painting this grand adventure. You might say it’s more realistic but sod realism, this is a fantasy game, and it’s all a bit too “trad”, at least at first blush.\n\nHowever, I can only speak personally. There are many people who adore trad fantasy and all its trappings, and who don’t like change. More power to them, but for me, at first glance, there doesn’t seem to a lot of originality here, in setting or theme. I persisted, peeled back those crusty brownish-grey outer layers, and found something truly engrossing. This game has a lot of humour, and a lot of heart.\n\nWhen it was first released, there was a lot of buzz about DA:O being a spiritual successor to the Baldur’s Gate games, which meant there would be swords, dragons, magic, derring-do and loads of fighting. This is all true of DA:O. There was also a lot of hype for the “Origins” system, proudly displayed in the title, which meant that instead of having one single starting sequence (location, npcs, events) you’d have a different one based on your race and class. You might find yourself a poor elf in an alienage, forced to get by on your wits and the point of a knife, or a stalwart dwarven noble in a monumental underground palace, and all the intrigue that entails. Where you come from also affects how you’ll be perceived by party members and other important characters in the game. It was supposed to make you feel more of a connection to your character, and I think it really works and actually helps give the game a decent amount of replayability.\n\nFrom my own experience the balance of the game is probably weighted about 60/40 in favour of combat over conversation, which is okay. It’s not great: there have been times when I’ve been exploring a temple or an underground cavern and become completely fatigued with having to fight the same enemies again and again, with the only difference being that this time it’s archers instead of mages standing at the back. It hasn’t happened often, though, and because the game is relatively free-form, you can always go and do something else. If you’re the type of player that prefers diplomacy over fistcuffery, beware: more often than not, quests end in big fights.\n\nCombat takes place in real-time, but you can pause the game to issue commands, and watch them play out when you unpause. There are tons of spells and skills, so you’ll want to make sure to use the right ones at the right times. I’d say that on any difficulty above Easy, you will need to pause quite regularly and be prepared to micro-manage to some degree. The other option is setting up tactics for each party member, which are like little scripts for them to follow. You might set up your tank to immediately engage the strongest enemy, or tell your mage to cast an AoE if enemies are standing near to each other. This takes time to organise, and tactics which work for one fight may not do so well in another, but generally this feature will reduce busywork and it can be satisfying to spectate as your team dismantles the enemy without you lifting a finger.\n\nFights can get quite busy. You will almost always be assaulted by many foes, some up close and some at range, and there will be bursts of fire and magic bolts flying. It can be hard to keep track, so it’s a good thing the devs included a tactical camera. You can flick the mousewheel to pull the camera back into the ceiling, just far enough that you can see who is who and where people are positioned. It’s pretty useful, and entirely missing from the console versions. Pat yourself on the back for owning a PC.\n\nI mentioned before that I’ve bounced off this game, and this has been because of difficulty spikes. Depending on in which order you choose to approach the three (or four, I forget) “main” quests in the game, you may find yourself running up against enemies which are too tough for you, or battles which seem to go on forever, where enemy waves continuously spawn. Case in point, Redcliffe, which Alistair, a party member, specifically advises you to tackle first of all. This questline is good fun, but very combat heavy and has a one particular fight where waves of enemies just keep on spawning, so you need to keep party members safe all the way through the fight. From a storytelling point of view it makes sense: Alistair cares for the Arl of Redcliffe, and can’t have known about the danger before telling you to go there. But as a player, it’s a harsh lesson to learn at an early point in the game. As I said, don’t be afraid to go and do something else if you keep getting hammered.\n\nWill wrap up with the most positive points. The writing is frequently excellent, particularly with regards to the banter between party members. The lore is deep, and the in-game codex completely overflows with interesting entries to read about the history of the land, the people and the places. It looks good! Faces are a bit “uncanny valley” at times, but mostly well animated and  believable.\n\nIf you’re in the market for a deep and fairly complex RPG to sink your teeth into, then get Dragon Age: Inquisition. But, if you’re poor like me, get this one.","December 11, 2014","true","54.0"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","1"

It has a lovely story of good vs. evil, and graces you with a lovely story with each waking. The companions, while not plentiful, are memorable. Each  one of them has a distinct personality, and react to different situations differently. Bioware has their trademark beautiful talking cutscenes, and depending on your group, and standing with them, they will jump into conversations on various occasions. The six varying ways to start the game adds a lot of diversity, and replayability for that matter. It's gameplay can be compared to WoW if you are familiar with it. A skill bar at the bottom for abilities and items, though a twist comes in. You have a party of four to control, you and three companions, and you have the ability to control each and every one. You gain even more control with the ability to pause the combat, and issues orders to be done when you unpause it. If you don't like strategizing, and have a console, you could pick it up on the Xbox or playstation for a more combat oriented gameplay.TL;DR, Overall, this game is a must-buy for anyone who enjoys the fantasy, spell-casting, and shield-bashing genre that this game falls under. In my honest opinion, this game is a 10/10.

I saw someone else playing it and wanted to give it a go. I ended up buying a PS3 and the game on console and played it through from start to finish twice (that's over 200 hours of playtime right there). Starting an Origins game is a bit of commitment, often I lose track of what I was planning for a character if I stop playing them for a while, so I start over. Rinse and repeat.\n\nAt the time I can genuinely say that this game changed my life. How it holds up now is a bit harder to say for sure. I find the combat slow (which was great when I had never played a combat game before) and in fact the whole game is a bit on the slow side by today's standards, but if you can get past older graphics and a slow pace, I recommend giving it a go. Especially, when you can buy the whole lot on sale for so little.\n\nIt has romance, humour, friendship, betrayal and so much more. The lore of the Dragon Age universe is deep and there is plenty to read if you're interested in a world with a lot of depth. The main story arc remains the same no matter what you do - for the most part - but you can surely mess with a lot of people's lives along the way, including your own followers. Will they find happiness? Love? A horrible death? Sometimes they will even break your heart.\n\nAlso, there are 6 totally different starts to the game depending largely on race and class. If you find starting the game as a human noble a bit boring, try being a circle mage or a dwarven commoner or dwarven royalty or a city elf or a dalish elf. Each start is different. You will find yourself in a different location with a different tragedy establishing who you are. A few hours in all the stories converge to the main story arc, but you will never forget where you came from and where it placed you in the world. No amount of "this is your backstory" can have the impact of experiencing it.\n\nEven better is that you can import your save game into DA2 or use the Dragon Age Keep to recreate (or rewrite) your story for Inquisition and the choices you made will change both of those games in many small ways! You can have a continuous history over all three games. It's a beautiful thing.\n\nAs for the content packs, some have more in them than others. One of my favourites is The Darkspawn Chronicles. Have you ever wondered how the final battle of a game would go if you were playing as the enemy? It was awful, having to defeat my own beloved companions in the final battle, but also really interesting. There were cutscenes and all. I may have even cried a little.\n\nAwakenings starts to move more into the style of Dragon Age 2 and introduces a very important character or two. It's a fairly substantial bit of extra content, maybe 20 hours from memory?\n\nAll the way back then, I would have given the game 9.9 out of 10, now... it's still a great game if you can get into it, a classic even, but it's dated. Of course it is.\n\nIf you have never tried a combat game before, but want to start playing combat games? You couldn't get a much easier introduction as you can pause combat (in all the DA games) and apply tactics - or just catch your breath. Difficulty can be ramped up if you want a challenge or right down if you want a cakewalk.\n\nMade me think, made me laugh, broke my heart, changed my life.\n\nOn PC there are also plenty of modding options, Nexus mods has over 2000 files. I never really modded Origins due to playing it primarily on console, but I like the idea.","February 11","true","39.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","5"

It's just a shame the pure ingredient called Bioware can't be found anymore. You always find it now tainted with EA.\n\nWhile you will find this title to be well crafted, it's not for everyone. I had to get over my hate for the  fantasy genre, which wasn't easy. I'm glad that I did, as I would have missed out on yet another  Bioware classic. If you prefer running n' gunning, don't dream of playing this unless you can change your attitude. Sadly, many of the newer generation of PC gamers fall into the “action packed” trap, where they miss out on what makes a game – it's story. Characters take revenge, scheme behind your back, among other things.\n\nSpeaking of story, one of my teachers once told me that a good plot mixes together the right amounts of gore, sex, and humor. While you will find all three in Dragon Age: Origins, there isn't enough humor to lighten the load so to speak. You will find that the story simply drags on. I recommend playing in 1-3 hour sessions, otherwise you might just end up leaving such a great title in the dust. The “behind your back” conversations are a nice break as the maps can take a long time to explore.\n\nIt took me about 65 hours to play though once, not even completing every single minor side quest. Mass Effect 3 took 24, and the others in the series about 12-24. The store page lists 80 hours of gameplay, which seems about right. Many won't be able to withstand that long on one game since it feels like it just drags on. At the end of the day, if you can bear with it, you won't be disappointed.\n\nThe “Ultimate Edition” includes quite a few DLCs that I didn't end up using/playing. The original seems plenty long enough, but I don't think I will end up going back soon for “The Awakening” DLC. The game ends with a cliff hanger, which was obviously setup for the 2nd.\n\nThe joke with Mass Effect is that you should get an achievement for not getting laid. While some of you understand that joke and it being true for Mass Effect, it's not the same here. Dragon Age uses a scale from -100 to 100 (or what seems to be -100). If a party member's gauge is to low, they will leave you! Mass Effect uses a simple 1-5 scale, where “loyalty” is at 4, romance is declared at a 5, and save porting uses a special 6. All of that is of course hidden, but in Dragon Age it isn't. This newer and what some would call better “romance mechanic” makes it hard to understand. This isn't a real life simulator, but does a much better job then the “getting laid simulator” in the Mass Effect series. You can follow and please one individual, but then end up displeasing others severely – even if they aren't in your current party. Throw in the invisible “hardening” mechanic as well.. You will have to read the wiki to understand how complex the whole game is.\n\nIt's judgment time now. I think 91/100 is fair for the metascore, as long as you can overcome your hate for the fantasy genre (nudge nudge me), not enough “pew pew” (many young gamers) and understand or appreciate the mature subjects within the title.\n\nSo all in all, even with bugs in character's movement, old 2009 graphics, and a story that just seems to drag on, I can't stamp a great or terrible score. Playing quite a few other titles, and understanding who you need to be to enjoy this, I give this super long review a number for the game.\n\n8.5/10","January 9, 2014","true","69.7"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phantathize/recommended/47810/","phantathize","Phoenix Rose","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phantathize/","101 products in account","The following review will be my first impression of the game.\nI bought the Ultimate Edition while it was on sale, and I definitely think I got more than my money's worth. In retrospect, I'd probably buy it for the normal price. Let me tell you why:\n\nPROS\n-In RPG's like Skyrim, ESO, and even Dragon Age Inquisition, I have a bad habit of skipping through dialouge. With this game, however, I found myself listening closely to every single cutscene. I started as a human rogue, so I'm not sure what the other origin stories are like.\n-The combat is certainly interesting. It's not like the games ahead of this one. In fact, it reminded me very much of Runescape combat. You click on an enemy, and your player auto-attacks it. Of course, you can use your abilities. I have yet to explore the tactical combat system. I just don't like pausing the game to give orders, and it's working out fine for me.\n-The character customization is decent. One benefit of playing on PC is the availability of mods. While I found the base hairstyles and facial features more than enough, there are some mods to add more choices if you're really invested in your character's appearance.\n-The followers are full of personality, and you can romance some of them too.\n-The dialouge options are great for roleplaying. Instead of the standard 2 choices of evil and good responses, there's four or so responses you can choose from to create a more in-depth personality for your character.\n\nCONS:\n-Don't be expecting amazing graphics. It's pretty standard, even on the highest setting.\n-The movement system is clunky and weird to get used to at first. A and D keys turn the camera instead of the traditional strafing movements offered by newer games. If you hold down the right mouse button you can swivel the camera, which I found to be easier.\n\nAs someone who played Dragon Age 2 and Inquisition before visiting this game, I can say it's a completely different experience- in a good way. You cannot go wrong buying this game while it's on sale.","January 21","true","8.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

However, with the pause capability and the ability to move every character to where I want them is perfect for me. Also the fact it let's me make my own danged decisions counts as well (well most of them...there are some it steers me into without mercy). I admit that I usually play at normal with a few drops into casual which enables me to enjoy the game even more. The fact that I can do that is  a plus, instead of doing a battle over and over until I win  (not that I haven't done that) or worse, be forced to give up. This game is like immersing oneself into a rich story that one mostly controls. Not that fate won't have it's say now and again. A thing that is all to the good. Like the building games I adore, you place one brick after another, each time hoping it's the right brick, and watch your creation expand and grow. Don't get complacent though, as any of your bricks/comments can cause a totally unexpected reaction.

This game succeeds at so many points. The game has a great story, setting, gameplay, characters, and mod support. I love the setting of thedas as it has so much potential for stories that can span multiple games. The great characters are what really help this game stands out from other similar RPGs. Every character is memorable, from the companions to the NPCs. Every companion is a 3 dimensional characters. And if you personally dislike a companion you will never find yourself outright hating them. The gameplay is very much like that of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic which is also a very good game. But the by far best aspect of this game is the story. You can choose from multiple origins, races, and classes. And these choices and the choices made during the main quest makes each playthrough different. This is one of the few games that I played through more then 20 times. The downloadable content add much more hours of gameplay plus with the mod support this game gets even more hours of replay value. This is by far one of the best RPGs I played and I can't recommend it enough.","May 17, 2015","true","243.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

This is presented at the start of your story.\n2)  Play one of three classes, Warrior, Rouge, or Mage.  At a higher level the class you choose can be improved to have skills like for example (Holy Smite) for the Warrior class.\n3)  What you choose to say for your Gray Warden will effect your RPC group and the story outcome.\n4)  Many quests during the Main story and side quests. To gain coin, favor from RPC's and loot.\n5)  Have a relationship either male, female, or both! Naughty Naughty!\n6)  Mixing your group. You can mix and match as much as you want between RPC in your party.\n\nThe not so Good\n\n1) Plot never changes so if you complete the Story at Normal level and play again at Hard level (Ho Hum) you already know what to do.  Of course it may take a long period of time to defeat the Archdeamon's army.\n2)  What? my (Gray Warden) is a mute? Kinda,  It would have been better to have him/her speak the sentence you have choosen.  When you choose a action for the (Gray Warden) it is acted out during the game.\n3) Weapons and Armor stay fresh and new, it would have been interesting to have items get worn or become damaged.\n\nThe game is addictive if you a first time player or return to it after a while.  What is nice with the Ultimate edition is that after you play the main story you can transfer your (Gray Warden) to one of the other stories to start another adventure.\n\n","June 8, 2015","true","605.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luriam/recommended/47810/","Luriam","Luriam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luriam/","307 products in account","Dragon Age: Origins is my favorite game of all times, and I am absolutely loving every bit of it. I must have finished it 5 times by now, and I still find myself drawn to it every year or so. It takes me about 120 hours to fully complete the Ultimate Edition. The Ultimate Edition of Dragon Age: Origins is the complete bundle consisting of Dragon Age: Origins, its expansions and its DLCs in a single release.\n\n\nWhich means that there is a huge world to explore: vast cities, villages, abandoned dwarven thaigs, large forests, underground caverns, ancient ruins, swamps, mountains, towers and citadels, palaces and estates, stores and taverns, caves and highways. Oh, I could go on for hours about all the places you could visit throughout your playthroughs. It's up to you, my dear reader, to take heart and embark on a journey like none you have ever had. And thanks to the insane amount content, detail, customization, and features - every playthrough will grant you a new experience.\n\nThere are six origins - background stories for player characters — that are playable in Dragon Age: Origins and a seventh in Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening. These playable backstories will allow the Warden to put themselves in a specific role within the social structure of Ferelden and will help explain motivations for the Warden joining the Grey Wardens. There are three main Races you can choose from: Human, Dwarf and Elf. After choosing your Origins and Race, you will get to choose your Class and Specialization. There are three classes – warrior, rogue and mage – in Dragon Age: Origins, each with four specializations. Six additional specializations were added in the expansion Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening. To be honest, all my 5 complete playthroughs were as a Human Mage. Gifted with a power considered dangerous by most, mages were always my favorite.\n\n\n"Tread carefully, friend.\nIf you intend to cross the\npath of one whose soul is\nso tightly woven into the realm of the arcane,\nI would not suggest\nyou do it lightly."\n\n\nDragon Age lets you create you character from scratch. You get to shape his appearance and choose a set of starting skills and powers. The game quickly envelops you in it's story. Which is a legendary adventure of a Grey Warden and his companions traveling together through the fantastic lands of Thedas, seeking to end the Blight and save the world from being utterly destroyed and enslaved by the Darkspawn. This is a long journey is full of fantasy and drama. Tragedy and Comedy. Romance and Betrayal. War and Peace. Good and Evil.\n\n\nMy Grey Warden was an almighty Archmage. Who wielded the power to crush and dismember the enemy with a snap of his fingers. A true leader, merciful and forgiving, capable of turning foes into friends. A most persuasive character, who tries to resolve every conflict peacefully. A man would help and save everyone, even with the cost of his own life.\n\n\nThe darkspawn are a race of humanoid tainted creatures that mostly dwell in the underground of Thedas. When the darkspawn uncover one of the Old Gods, they expose it to the taint, changing it into an Archdemon, which then leads them in an attack against the surface world called a Blight. The darkspawn are perhaps the greatest single threat to all of Thedas; they are bloodthirsty, exceptionally numerous and willing to indiscriminately kill or corrupt all in their path.\n\n\nBut my favorite part of the game - was the companionship and all that comes with it. On your travels you will meet all sorts of people, because you live in a world full of magic and wonders, abounding with energy ready to be gathered. You will travel thousand of miles, meeting: Humans, Elves, Dwarves and Qunari which could be your friends or enemies, depending on your approach. Some of them will join your cause, becoming your most trusted friends who would shield you from the killing blow. Or perhaps your relationships would develop into something even more wonderful, and they would become your loved ones. Romance and Friendship is always nice, especially when the characters feel this natural and real. Each with their own thoughts and impressions on your current situation. Some of them may approve and appreciate the fact that you're helping innocent people, saving entire villages from being destroyed or just doing charity, while others may think it's a total waste of time, and recommend you to carry on. Their personalities are so full-fledged and so deep, that even the most brief connection can make the strongest and most indelible impression.\n\nJust like in real life, everyone is a stranger at first, and every companion is a puzzle. But with each passing day, you start do discover who they truly are thus, slowly solving the once mysterious puzzle. Depending on your words and actions, your companions will either: become your friends or your enemies, fall in love with you or desert you completely. You can always head to the camp, where you can find all your party members:\n\n- Morrigan - a charming shapeshifting sorceress. With a personality as cold as the tips of her pretty little fingers. But beneath all that sarcasm and cynicism, lies a frigid little girl. That wishes to be protected, truly loved and appreciated by people she cares for. [1]\n\nMorrigan: Have a care where your eyes linger, Alistair.\nAlistair: Yes, well don't worry. It's not what you think.\nMorrigan: I see.\nAlistair: I was looking at your nose.\nMorrigan: And what is it about my nose that captivates you so?\nAlistair: I was just thinking that it looks exactly like your mother's.\nMorrigan: I hate you so much.\nAlistair: What?\nMorrigan: Never mind.\n\n- Alistair - a former templar initiate who was recruited into the Grey Wardens not long before the protagonist. A valiant warrior and a loyal friend. He has a good and caring heart, and often will ask the Warden about his or her welfare. While serious and sincere most of the time, he likes to joke around and isn't afraid to appear somewhat childish. Which I think, is a wonderful trait to have. [2]\n\nJoin us, brothers and sisters. Join us in the shadows where we stand vigilant. Join us as we carry the duty that cannot be forsworn. And should you perish, know that your sacrifice will not be forgotten... and that one day, we shall join you.\n\n- Leliana - a bard and cloistered sister from Orlais who sought refuge in Ferelden. She firmly believes in the existence of the Maker, and thus dedicated her life to the chantry. She is a very skilled rogue and a cunning ally. A very passionate and eloquent young lady. [3]\n\nLeliana: Maybe we could get you in a nice dress one day. Silk. No, maybe velvet.\nMorrigan: Stop looking at my breasts like that. 'Tis most disturbing!\n\nThe voice acting is extremely well done. All the people you meet feel alive and unique. The music is memorable and epic, Inon Zur quickly became one of my favorite composers.\n\nThis game is a true masterpiece. I still get goosebumps every time the battle at Ostagar is about to start. I still shed a tear or two when Duncan dies. And I still get a goofy smile every time Alistair cracks one of his classic jokes. Priceless.\n\nEvery creature you kill, every flower you crush, and every choice you make, will undoubtedly affect the world and it's people. And depending on how will you Push the World - the World will Push back.\n\nI would like to talk about every character and every aspect of this stunning game, but it seems that I've hit the limit. And it is time to end this review. I will leave you with this last quote:\n\n[/i]"Either you have an enviable memory, or a pitiable life, to know nothing of regret."

What it makes it unique is the fact that you can choose an origin story for a specific race(human, elf or dwarf) which makes a real difference throughout the game. Each character has it's own tale, so each romance is something new. You have a whole nation to explore and unite under your command. As  a Grey Warden, you'll  put kings on their thrones, solve mystic mysteries, fight in glorious(and large in scale) battles. In this edition, you'll also enjoy a what-if scenario(the bad guys win), an origin story(of a naughty bard), a big expansion pack that gives your character a worthy story, a nightmareish adventure with big rewards and an epilogue with the companion who you do not fully understand in the main story. The game also has a strong modding comunity(it's own nexus site). I played a lot of it on the PS3 and I intend to do hundreds of hours with it on steam, because every playthrough is a new experience(so many varieties, I find myself not doing things the same way).

I usually can't play through a story based RPG game more than once, but I played this one 4 times all the way through and a bunch more just for origin stories.\n\nOrigins means there are many different introductory storylines depending on the race/class you pick (6 in total I believe) that all have different starting stories which integrate into the main story.  It's so engrossing that characters you meet later on while playing an Elf are characters that belong to other race/class' origin stories and vice versa.  There are so many fine details to the story this way, and you have a chance to manipulate everything based on your actions and outcomes of choices.\n\nOn top of the grand story comes gameplay.  It's a classic RPG style (like Baldur's Gate), but with modern enhancements and features so that it doesn't feel ancient or clunky.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/motherfuckingwaffleking/recommended/47810/","motherfuckingwaffleking","Waffle King","http://steamcommunity.com/id/motherfuckingwaffleking/","203 products in account","Witches Don't Wear Bras - An Official Waffle King Review\n~Find more here.[www.nonm.co.uk]\n\nSwords and junk are pretty cool. When I was little I liked to pretend that sticks were swords and swing them at the kids on the bus stop that I didn't like. They always said to watch out or I'd poke their eyes out. But I showed them. Oh, I showed them. Little did I know, that was little baby Waffle King's first little foray into the world of roleplaying games. I could be whatever I wanted, and I could wield powerful weapons beyond your imagination. Like those perfect sticks that make whistling noises when you swing them.\n\n\nAs I grew older, of course RPG games would be a genre I got pulled back to time and time again. But in this day and age, true roleplaying games have become harder to come by. The big guys upstairs, the game publishers that control what we play, they don't want those. Because you know what, those games are hard. They're really hard. Making choices is hard. Consequences are hard. It's so much easier if you can just mash buttons and make things happen. And if you want to learn every skill? You can do that. It's okay.\n\n\nHardcore RPG's aren't a genre that's explored often by big publishers. They're a niche type of game. One of the biggest developers of RPG's of that nature, Bioware, is still around. But sadly, there's a lot of corporate fingers in their ♥♥♥.\n\n\nThey've made some of the greatest RPG classics. And some other games. Those were alright. Even after being acquired by EA, they still put out a number of quality games. Before, you know. It happened. RIP.\n\n\nDragon Tales Origins was one of the first games to come out under the new EA and Bioware partnership, launching on Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and PC; it's a spiritual successor to Neverwinter Nights and the acclaimed Baldur's Gate games.\n\n\nEver watch that one movie Lord of the Rings? Kinda like that, only you get to bang a witch.\n\n\nShe doesn't really wear clothes or anything. She has some shower curtains or something over her shoulder.\n\n\nDragon Tales is a pretty good game. A hardcore tactical strategy RPG, with an emphasis on the roleplaying aspect. You become the guy with the sword that does the things. You are him or her. You get to bang that witch and save the world. It's all you, buddy.\n\n\nA grand tale of zombies and witch ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, Dragon Tales Origins is extremely heavy with lore. They really went all out trying to build this fantasy world. They got the elves, the dwarves, and all that good stuff. Completely original lore, totally not just Lord of the Rings with some things switched around. In fact, they were so proud of their work they even went and named it Origins. They were planning ahead. They already knew it was gonna be big. They were gonna make a series out of it from the very beginning. And ♥♥♥♥, they really wrote a ♥♥♥♥ing book. It's a book, a book with some RPG elements mixed in. I didn't pay attention in History class, the ♥♥♥♥ you think I'm gonna memorize the lore of Dragon Tales for?\n\n\nIt's written well at least, and the characters are a joy to be around. They're colorful and multi-dimensional, and you can sex them all up. Not all at once, they get mad at you for trying to do that. Which is definitely holding me back from giving the game a perfect score. You can even do gay things in Origins, one of the defining features that made it so popular with the Tumblr crowd. You can gay things up, and that is clearly what gay people look for most in their games. They're mostly awkward teenage girls actually, they love gay sex more than actual gay people. But you know, this is exactly what they look for in a game and they're free to like what they like.\n\n\nWriting would be what I'd say is Dragon Tales' best trait. It's visually a little dated, with a pretty good soundtrack. But the writing, ooh wee, that's some good swords and magic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. An RPG like Origins thrives on writing, though. It's all about pulling you in, letting you live the role of a dude with a sword in a medieval setting.\n\n\nThe only problem with this setup is that the game mechanics aren't quite welcoming to the whole swords thing. In fact, I really wouldn't recommend using swords at all. Just don't, for your own good.\n\n\nYou get to build your own character and assign them one of several backstories, races, and classes. It encourages you to make many different characters, to see the story from different angles and to make different choices to see the outcome should you have made one choice instead of the other. But what the game fails to encourage is using any class other than mage. Really, the mage is the best thing to play and is the only thing I'd recommend.\n\n\nA knight or warrior's job is to walk into monsters and take up space while mages attack and heal. Rogues are fun also, allowing you free rein over the battlefield to just kinda walk around, stab guys in the back, and all that good stuff. But mages get the most cool things to use. Exploding lightning, blizzards, and summoning giant spiders and ♥♥♥♥. It's the definitive way to play this game by a long shot. Not to mention how poorly balanced they are. If you're fighting enemies and there's an enemy mage, you gun for that guy first because he can crush your entire party in no time. And it's the exact same vice versa. So you're gonna want to take good care of your mage.\n\n\nYou get to order your party members around as well, so if you do choose to make your main character something other than the best class in the game you can always just play as ♥♥♥♥♥ witch. Who is the best character in the game.\n\n\nOrdering around your allies isn't exactly optional however. They don't really have much in terms of AI. Their default tactics are to headbutt monsters while singing the U.S. National Anthem, The Star-Spangled Banner. Classic song, great song. But it helps out much more if you can command them to fight strategically. You have to pretty much program them through a bunch of clunky menus, which is my favorite thing in a game. You know me, I like my menus how I like that ♥♥♥. Hard to handle and all over the place. If it takes me less than ten minutes to get from Point A to Point B, it just isn't clunky enough. I want to spend hours trying to work that ♥♥♥. Menus and asses like that are a true work of perfection and are the clear indicator of brilliant game design. Swapping between characters on the fly works well if you're gonna fight that way also, but also can be very intensive during major fights.\n\n\nI'd still consider it one of my favorite RPG's, even if it has numerous little flaws and hasn't aged well in some regards. I've enjoyed multiple playthroughs, and it is still fun the second and third time. There's definitely a clear right way to play it, which is as a mage and on PC. Keyboard shortcuts, hotkeys, and the superior camera controls and options really make it the definitive way to play. But it's still decently enjoyable however you should tackle it. PC users have mods though also, so you can see uncensored ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and stuff. That's why people mod stuff in the first place.\n\n\nIt's a wordy game, full of reading and numbers and nerd things. But it's immersive and fun, and a testament to Bioware's secret formula to making some of the best RPG's. Well it's not exactly a secret, you just need to be able to sex people, commit genocide, and unite the many tribes to vanquish a great evil that you told everyone was coming and no one listened.\n\n\nDragon Tales always reminds me of raisins though. When I first played it, I was just kind of marathon-playing it and needed a snack. But there was nothing at all to eat in my house. Nothing but raisins. And it was a giant industrial-size can of raisins too. It had like 100 servings or something. So I just ate raisins while I played. That's all I had. I've learned from my mistakes, and I keep other things stocked up now. You just gotta live and learn, man. Just live and learn.","February 25","true","7.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","100","7","7","8","1"

The gameplay is great, second to none, the storyline coundn't be anybetter BioWare really knows how to pull it off as shown in also in their Mass Effect Series. The storyline does well to get you attached to the game by making the descions that you make effect how the story pans out for you for the rest of the game and its expansions (classic BioWare tho i must note). The chat dialouges and cutscenes are always dramatic and never cease to bore you and always seem to add to the drama and hype of the already superb Storyline, the quests are never boring and their are endless side quests to do besides the storyline, this game will last you weeks on end.The characters in this game are represented very well, with so many different personallities in the game you are never left short from any chat dialogue. As for things to do other than questes you can't fall short, Poison Making, Trap Making, Tactics, Enchanting, Gathering and much more, I'm sure you wouldn't run out of things to do. As far as i am concerned i have not come across any glitchs or problems though bearing in mind it is a game and i am sure i will encounter one soon enough. I would recomend this game to anyone that really likes RPG games that have a great storyline and good feel overall to the gameplay, this game is like all the good things from The Elder Scrolls Series and The Diablo Series put together it is just great and i cannot stop playing it, best $7.50 i've ever spent and I would be willing to pay the actual price of around $20-$30 for this game because it is worth every cent you pay for. Had this game not gone on sale i would've never bought it, hats off to Valve for putting this game on sale and getting this gem out of the rough.

After that you are thrust onto a tale of revenge which prompts you to gather all of the various powers in the land toward survival, or risk extinction.\n\nWhat Dragon Age Origins does well is moral ambiguity and effective characterization. All of your party members have unique and interesting backstories, many of whom are entirely optional to recruit and you could just as easily murder them if you please. This also extends to the villains, who are all very complex and have some of the best dialogue in the game.\n\nThis is the Ultimate Edition which includes all of the paid DLC Bioware released, including the expansion pack Dragon Age Awakening.

Among other things, you can also place traps and use poisons or other items to exploit certain weaknesses. At first, combat may be a little difficult with getting used to the controls and such but it then gets a little easier, to the point you can play without pausing but be warned - the difficulty does go up again soon afterwards, there are many battles you won't win without pausing and thinking about how your party should be reacting to the situation. * You can also set automated tactics for each party member, including your own character, for when you're not controlling them.\n\nThis is the type of game that actually gets you interested in the lore around it - I know I personally have issues getting into the lore in a lot of games, but it just kind of sucked me in. The world feels so complete that you'll want to learn everything you can. As far as RPG goes, you play a silent protagonist of your choice (several different options, such as a run away bride or a nobleman) and make decisions that will impact your entire game, as well as Dragon Age 2 if you choose to play that as well. There are three or four main endings but keep in mind they are all of a similar premise so do not expect something like one of the alternate Silent Hill endings with aliens.\n\nThe characters are extremely engaging and varied in personality. They even react uniquely to each other - some hating or liking others. You get to see these reactions either in the form of banter while traveling, as an aside when you're having a conversation with another character in public(wandering) or even with certain character combinations in scenes. It is also possible to somewhat shape their personalities to the extent of continuing to be who they are or becoming "stronger" socially.\n\nAs far as romance goes, you'll have three choices per character. Two opposite gender characters and one same sex, with only one of the opposite gender characters changing per your gender, so that's two male and one female for a female character and two female and one male for a male character. Each of these romances are quite deep and you see significant character development, possible more-so of three of the four though. The main two gender-locked romances will affect the story the most if you continue them to the end of the game. One thing to note, is that the romances suffer from sex as a sort of finale, and only the two main gender-locked relationships will continue story-wise afterwards. The other two do not end, but do not have anymore significant scenes.\n\nOverall, a fantastic game that'll keep you entertained for days. I've done two complete playthroughs so far and am going to get all the achievements and then play a few more playthroughs - totally not tired of this game! Each playthrough is interesting and generally unique.","June 22, 2014","true","129.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You're constantly asked to battle between different choices, where the answers might sometimes be clear to you but other times are just torturingly difficult! The answers are never "good" vs "bad". You will sometimes have to do things you don't like in order to get what you want or viceversa, as well as persuade people into doing things they might not want to do. This really is a deep game with excellent story-telling and interesting characters who are not your average one-dimensional goody two-shoes kind of people.\n\nYou're able to have a romance with (most) of your companions, and choices such as race and class really do affect, not just where you'll be beginning your adventure, but also your character's story along the way and eventually the ending you might get. The romance with your companions doesn't just start and end with "I like you, do you like me too?" You'll have to actually work for it, giving your companions gifts and also getting to know them better. They won't always like your choices, both in battle and out, so be prepared for drama!\n\nThe story is incredibly interesting and though some scenes may drag slightly, it will keep you on the edge of your seat most of the time, especially because your actions will directly or indirectly affect the lives of the other characters and citizens of Ferelden. They are not just small choices; you might even decide to ally with a different force and end up butchering a village of innocent people almost by accident (yes, it happend to me!).\n\nThere are so many endings and so many different choices to make, depending on which dialogue options you chose, how close you are to your companions, your relationship status with them and ultimately the type of person you want to become in game, that it makes replaying dragon age almost entirely different every time. You'll want to keep saving your game right before a dialogue just in case you get the outcome you didn't want!\n\nDefinitely recommend this game to anyone who loves fantasy, rich history and lore, romance, as well as great character customisation/development, dialogue choices which actually matter and interesting story-telling in a unique is-this-a-movie-or-a-game? kind of way.","January 15, 2015","true","107.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

The next is the protagonist of this game, in spite of and actually due in part to the fact that the character has no voice, even though you are clearly talking. It's better for immersion. This game has that in spades. It's beautiful and atmospheric and deep and by god it's depressing. It's gritty, serious, dark, gory, sad, and depressing. This game almost constantly beats you over the head with horrid events that make you curl into the fetal position with the brutality.

I mean there's not exactly anything that somehow hasn't been done before, right? And yet, this game is captivating. My first run i completed playing all the time, sitting there til late (or early, looking at it other way) hours, unable to leave Ferelden and telling myself "wow, just one more quest, and then talk with that character, and...". And now i have completed the main story around 6 times, plus a couple of runs of awakening and other extensions. Had just as much fun every time.\nHaving both a captivating plot and good gameplay, DAO is a good choice for both people who are story oriented and gameplay oriented. If you arent very good at games (like me), easy setting is there for you and you can complete the game fairly easy. If you are up for a challenge, you have harder settings too.\nWhat is important for me in Origins are characters. They feel so alive and make you feel you are a part of the game. Even side characters or villains are interesting and captivating. At first i didnt expect to love so many characters, but there i am, hoping more of them would be romanceable...\nCustomization of your character is rather well too, although it could be better. Nothing you cant fix with mods - theres plenty of them, whatever you may need.\nGraphics are obviously slighly outdated, though personally i prefer them more than the wow-so-hd graphics in newest games, but thats just my preference. Locations are nice to look at, though.\nThe best part is probably how much your choices change the game - maybe not exactly all of them turn it around, but i think that many small remarks showing how much changes depending who you play or what you have done are nicer. Not to say that there arent many important decisions - you can decide fate of your companions, more or less, decide who is going to be crowned and many other things that are probably spoilers.\n\ntl;dr: give DAO a shot. There is a reason why DA games got popular.","January 4","true","375.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Excellent choice&consequence, extensive lore, solid RPG mechanics and combat, though held back a lot by over-reliance on the MMO healer-tank-DPS archetype, instead of sticking with the D&D mechanics that made Baldur's Gate great. But still, the combat is engaging and never too easy. A lot of content also - 54 hours in and I have only completed the main game; I still have to do all the DLCs as well as the expansion pack Awakening.\n\nDragon Age: Origins was probably one of the best RPGs in the few years before and after its release. It's a shame about the sequels because Bioware could have turned this franchise into something truly great. Origins looks, feels, and plays like a cRPG, and was developed primarily for PC, but its sequels had a console audience in mind and it shows. The squandered potential of Dragon Age is just one more thing EA has run into the ground.\n","August 22, 2015","true","70.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Not in maps (of which there are plenty), but in depth. The characters all have fascinating backstories, but the world itself is what truly shines. The codexes in this are nearly an art form.

There wasn't a moment when I felt the game was bad, even if it has a few frustrating parts. It takes you on an incredible journey and let's you make very hard decisions along the way. Even though the combat can feel a little clunky at times, it doesn't hurt the rest of the game. You have intriguing companions and interesting ways to expand your friendships with them. It has great replay value if you are interested to see how the game's world will treat you as a different race, class and with different choices.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CureOptimism/recommended/47810/","CureOptimism","Cure Optimism","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CureOptimism/","316 products in account","This is one of the last BIoWare games that *felt* like a BioWare game after their acquisition by Electronic Arts. It is a RTwP RPG with a pretty average main plot, but what makes it shine is the excellent writing and personalities of the companions you pick up on your adventure to stop the big-bad. If you play this game the right way, you will grow attached to the characters after spending 20-40 hours killing monsters with them, learning about their past, goals and desires along the way. Each character is distinct from one another, and fleshed out to make you really care about their ultimate fate. That doesn't stop you from being a complete scum bag to them, which yeilds its own rewards in the form of comedy (At least for me)\n\nThe combat system is accessible, but not simplistic enough that you can go into each battle and not use tactics, (Not on higher difficulty settings at least).  Some battles require a great deal of thinking in order to devise the perfect strategy to take down a large group of enemies, or a tough boss. There are a large number of skills and talents to learn as you level up, as well as 3 different classes to choose from (Rogue, Mage, Warrior) which each have a few of their own sub-classes called specializations which also hold different abilities to learn, which makes the game extremely replayable right off the bat, even if there weren't multiple ending (Which there are). But there are also different Origin stories, as the title suggests. Dwarven Noble, Dwarven Commoner, Dalish Elf, City Elf, Human Noble and Circle Mage, which adds even more replayability since each origin story and race choice changes certain dialogues, the opening act and even certain missions down the road.\n\nThose who can't get enough swag will be delighted to know that there are plenty of epic armor, weapons and other loots to be found here to slaughter things with, which makes it a pleasure to play if you can't get enough of the cosmetic side of RPGs. The only thing I have a problem with is that the mage class has a very limited selection of rather boring robes to sport, and that is disappointing. There are also plenty of sidequests to complete over the course of your adventure, which range from dull fetch quests to epic dragon slaying.\n\nSo in conclusion, the game is quite good. The characters are memorable, the combat is fun and challenging, plenty of armor and weapons to choose from, multiple endings and hours of content to play. It is well worth the money, in my opinion.\n\nThat is all.\n\n","July 30, 2014","true","158.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tiranui/recommended/47810/","tiranui","tiranui","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tiranui/","193 products in account","I overall enjoyed this game and consider it Bioware's swan song.\n\nThe origin story chosen by the player impacts not only your dialogue options, but also the level of classism and fantastical racism encountered.\n\nThe female Dalish elf has few rights, lives in poverty(walled off segregated part of the city), and gets taken to be a mistress for the local noble. She has little social mobility and only gets out of her scenario from being enlisted by the Gray Wardens. There is no social justice, only results matter from her actions afterward. This provided for me a sense of agency in my actions versus being dropped into say roleplaying as Geralt of Rivia in the Witcher series.\n\nThe Noble female noble’s story is also one of revenge. Yet she can still do more. She can by my count simultaneously be: Queen consort of Fereldan, Teyrna of Gwaren, the second in line heir to Highever, Commander of the Grey in Fereldan, and Arlessa of Amaranthine. That is like... Michelle Obama if she was also Governor of Florida, heir of California, and Mayor of New York City and Marshal General of all the armed forces.\n\nThere are many origins but only one Duncan to help that origin character. The others origin characters are dead if they do not get enlisted. The player can encounter the Dwarf commoner’s corpse in a part of the plot. With no Duncan to enlist him, he refuses to eat and thus dies in prison.\n\nThe format of the vanilla campaign follows the usual Bioware formula. The main character must travel to four locations, solve the local issues and convince that faction to help in the final battle. You are hunted by the darkspawn and will encounter a vision/dream sequence with the big bad. As you travel you will encounter the ruins of an ancient civilization (lost dwarven thaigs/Prothiens/Underdark) lost over time yet full of artifact tier items and lore.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to Baldur’s gate but does not rely on the daily spell count limit of D&D gameplay. Mages are far stronger than many other classes for regular enemies. With some exceptions such as the Gaxkang lich battle.\n\nThis game reminded me of Baldur’s Gate a lot. If the Warden badly handles decisions, party members will leave the party and even challenge you for leadership. The backgrounds of the characters should be considered in your political dealings. During the Landsmeet, if you arranged for Anora and Alistair to marry it can backfire if you let Loghain live and join the order to redeem himself. To conscript Loghain into the Wardens will make Alistair furious. To Alistair, joining the Grey Wardens is a sacred duty and honor, it is not a death sentence. By contrast, if you let Alistair execute Logain, Anora will break down the political alliance as she cannot marry the killer of her father.\n\nWhat I found charming in this game was the fact that character interactions and growth seems to happen naturally. Alistair’s reception to mages was something I felt was handled very well. His early training was that of a Templar, a role sworn to strike down mages if they are taken over by demons of the Fade. Yet Alistair is scared of Morrigan and neutral to Wynne. At first glance you may think he hates all mages. But the reason he distrusts Morrigan so much is not just because she is a mage. Rather the issue is that Morrigan is a maleficar, someone outside of the rules of the Chantry. She practices unknown magic (shapeshifting, is neutral to blood magic rituals, etc) that he has been taught all of his life is evil and wrong. He is actually terrified of her.","January 25, 2014","true","68.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It has a rich and detailed lore surrounding the game world that sets up the stage for your adventures in the game. The main story is also very intriguing and is full of twists and turns that will keep you entertained for the whole ride. It also offers many side-quests that flesh out the world with many unique stories, and every conversation you have reveals more information about the world of Dragon Age. If you love a good fantasy world, than Dragon Age doesn’t fail to disappoint.\n\nThe story is the traditional Bioware set-up, with a bit of a twist. When you create your character, you get to pick a race, an origin and a gender. Depending on your choices, the characters in the world will treat you differently. More importantly, you play a short 30-60 minute intro story that is unique to your origin. Then there is a 30-60 minute general intro sequence that you play, before the world opens up. You have to travel to multiple different locations, in any order you choose, in order to get different factions to pledge their loyalty to you for a battle against the game’s main enemy, the Darkspawn. Each area you go to have its own problems that you must sort out before they will pledge allegiance to you. Like everything you do in Dragon Age, solving these problems tells you more about the society and world of Dragon Age. The story continues on and ends in a grand finale. The main is very interesting.","December 19, 2013","true","92.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It has a rich and detailed lore surrounding the game world that sets up the stage for your adventures in the game. The main story is also very intriguing and is full of twists and turns that will keep you entertained for the whole ride. It also offers many side-quests that flesh out the world with many unique stories, and every conversation you have reveals more information about the world of Dragon Age. If you love a good fantasy world, than Dragon Age doesn’t fail to disappoint.\n\nThe story is the traditional Bioware set-up, with a bit of a twist. When you create your character, you get to pick a race, an origin and a gender. Depending on your choices, the characters in the world will treat you differently. More importantly, you play a short 30-60 minute intro story that is unique to your origin. Then there is a 30-60 minute general intro sequence that you play, before the world opens up. You have to travel to multiple different locations, in any order you choose, in order to get different factions to pledge their loyalty to you for a battle against the game’s main enemy, the Darkspawn. Each area you go to have its own problems that you must sort out before they will pledge allegiance to you. Like everything you do in Dragon Age, solving these problems tells you more about the society and world of Dragon Age. The story continues on and ends in a grand finale. The main is very interesting.","December 19, 2013","true","92.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

By in-depth conversations, you can choose to dive as deep into lore as you want - or ignore it and just go for gameplay. Romancing is another option that creates a deeper, believable bond between you and your significant other and/or party members.

Put another 20 hours on this and you will get my gameplay time. I started playing the standard edition then realized what an awesome game it is and bought the ultimate edition full price well worth it!\n\nThis is up there with some of my favourite ever games! Truly epic! The story was so immersive. There was never a time I wanted to get to the end. Infact I didn't want it to end and im not sure I have ever felt like that about a game. The biggest compliment I can give this is its as good as some of my favourite books.\n\nI thought the characters were a bit quirky at first but boy did they grow on you. They ended up feeling like friends, you get to know them and like them even the more difficult ones lol (probably need to get out more) but its truly a testament to the writing and voice acting superb! I got choked up at the end.\n\nIt was a tough game also it gave me a fight the whole way through but you truly feel like you have lived it at the end. Took me a little while to get my game style together and choose characters that worked well, once I had I was rolling.\n\nAbsolutely loved it! Sad it has ended. Two big thumbs up and a big toe.\n\nEdit Review 1.25.2015 Played dlc.\n\nWell well to my joy and astonishment I hadn't played through all the dlc. I thought that all the dlc was part of the game and then I looked into a section called other campaigns I think and there was all this content I hadn't realized was there Oh Joy!\n\nIf you loved the game as much as me then this was just such a treat. There was a small standalone story nothing to do with our story but in the world which was fun. There was even a story from the point of the Darkspawn. Awakenings is really were the money was spent a proper campaign and an excellent addition to the story. It really is your story there was some major plot changing decision that really changed the narrative and ended my story interestingly. Im not sure I made the right decision but thats life, thats Rpg. Then a tale of Morrigan which left me asking more questions than answering and I felt sad for my virtual friend.\n\nWhat a trip. Nearly a !00 hours in total for £20.00. I would say thats bang for buck.

It has all the standard Bioware flaws (occasionally flat acting, goofy romance hooks, a story centered around an ancient evil and a prophecy) but also all the charm and memorable characters you get with Bioware, too. It also has some unintended hilarity in the form of a huge, mutant dog (name "Dog") who will actually lick the copious blood effects off of your armor after every fight if you ask him. But you never should, because walking around town talking to nobles and merchants soaked in blood after killing a single rat is one of the funniest parts of the game.

Each class has unique strengths and weaknesses, mages, rogues and warriors alike all contribute something special to the battles. The game itself is very challenging but satisfying and fun at the same time.\n+ Rogues can learn the art of dual wielding and typically fit in as party DPSER, while Mages have access to a plethora of spells, from aoe and single target disables, to healing, revivals, nuke damage and more. Warriors can inflict savage damage with two handed weapons or tank enemies with a shield and armour.\n\n+ The dialogue and story in Dragons Age Origins: Ultimate Edition is amazing. Bioware are well known for their fantastic storytelling and this game is no exception. There are memorable characters who you can build friendships with and complete quests for. Romance is also an option. The main plot is well thought-out and maintains your interest.\n+There's a large number of side quests to complete, around 120 hours of content in total with the expansions. Plenty of moral decision making which impacts on the story progression too.\n+ Lots of random event encounters, with forests, temples and ancient ruins to explore, along with several cities.\n\n\nMixed:\n\n~ For 2009 the graphics are not the best, but by no means are they terrible. This is definitely no reason to avoid the game.\n\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Some redundant skills, like trap making or survival, that don't seem to serve any useful purpose.\n\nOverall Score 9/10\n\nDragons Age Origins: Ultimate Edition is a really solid game in pretty much every respect. Well worth purchasing on sale for $10 or less. In fact, many digital distributors are offering this price daily, so don't miss out.","September 30, 2015","true","119.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I finished it in 40 hours, but it could easily take you 20 hours longer to complete everything.\n\nThe characters have depth, the story is pretty good, the graphics also still look very good and the gameplay is tight for a 3D RPG. It can be a bit unbalanced at times though, so I had to change the difficulty from time to time in order to advance. It's disappointing but, it never really frustrates.\nThe isometric view is actually very helpful and, in my opinion, works better than the default camera view. I do admit that the default view is the more cinematic one, but for the later battles isometric view is recommended, required even.\n\nDragon Age is a title that I immensely enjoyed. It's one of the better RPGs of the last decade so if RPG is your thing you should definitely play this.\n\n(Play the second one as well. Despite the repetitiveness of the environments it's also well worth a playthrough and it's not as bad as people say it is).\n\n[Rating: 92/100]","December 12, 2013","true","0.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","8"

Having been criminally denied more KotOR (which is what I truly wanted), this was as close as I was going to get to that same feeling; Squad-based tactical RPG with a heavy emphasis on character interaction, development and choice... Just describing it makes me want to fire it up again.\n\nThe setting and tone is similar to Game of Thrones, but before the show even existed; A dark fantasy that delves into intrigue, mystery, deception and tragedy. Not to mention a heavy dose of epic adventure. Of course the game doesn't always take itself so seriously, taking cues from its predecessor by implementing some charming, quirky characters and an overall sense of hope in the darkness. The consistenly excellent writing, VO and art design all come together in a way that helps you get lost in the universe they created.\n\nThe story, and how it unfolds, is really quite good. As the name suggests, your origin is important, and what you choose to be at the beginning will have a noticeable impact on your path. However, everyone ultimately finds their way into the arms of the Grey Wardens, a jedi-esque order of warriors devoted to stopping a horde of darkspawn from spreading throughout the land. They recruit you, train you, and before you know it, throw you into the fire. What happens in the next 40-60 hours is for you to discover. That number will of course grow considerably if you get all of the DLC.\n\nOrigins is unique for a modern Western game, in the sense that it is actually fairly challenging. The enemies, especially a few hours into the game, are tough and it only gets harder. Even on normal difficulty you will likely get your ♥♥♥ kicked a few times, soon to realize that a strategic approach is the best way to succeed. The combat is complex but it makes sense, taking the fundementals of KotOR and making it even deeper.\n\nOf course now having said all of that, it looks like I'm going to be playing it soon... You should do the same.","December 17, 2013","true","137.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Dragon Age has some outstanding well-written characters. The combat system is a great, and once you get used to managing your party and using their unique abilities, combats becomes easy. Your freedom to choose makes this game really good. The story is avarage and will always be the same, but there are few choices you can make that will change the ending. In my opinion is this game even better than Skyrim because of the freedom you'll have. You will lose yourself in this adventure for many hours. This game is worth paying, even on sale, and if you are a true RPG lover this is a game you shouldn't skip.","June 29, 2014","true","199.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The lore of this game is huge and always interesting to read.\n\nThe music is beautiful and Aubrey Ashburn has a beautiful voice. The Voice acting is top-notch as well.\n\nThe combat is tactic-based with some micromanaging but that depends on the difficulty you are playing. You don't have to use tactics, but it will make the gameplay a breeze to play. If you don't like the speed of the combat, there is mod to speed it up.\n\nThere is also a website full of Dragon Age mods. I highly recommend playing the game vanilla mode, however.\n\nThe graphics are okay.

I'm a HUGE Bioware fanboy and in series like KoToR or Mass Effect you choose either all Good or Bad choices because of an alignment tree, which doesn't allow you to make the character that reflects you. In Dragon age all the choices reflect how you are as a person, no alignment tree no incentives to do everyone good or bad it's how you want to play. It makes you really get lost in this wonderful world. With all that said the combat system is very  unique...and that's not such a good thing. Let's just say I struggled through the combat system and was rewarded with a great story.

(Hence the game's title)\n+Many build options and various specs branching from three base classes: Warrior, Mage and Rogue.\n\nCons:\n-If you are someone that values graphics over other things keep in mind that this game came out in 2009, so it is bound to be graphicaly outdated (The graphics aren't bad tough).\n-The main storyline is kind of typical and straightforward, and depending on your choices it might end in a way that leaves you with a bitter taste.\n-The relationship system with your followers is not that well done, you might find that the character you are trying to romance in their highes approval level and still don't show any interest in taking your friendship further.\n-It has mods, but the game's modding mechanics are kind of tough to get acustomed with, especially if you are new to modding games.\n\nAll in all it is a very good game and while it isn't perfect, since it is a mess to activate the dlc for some people, for example, it is a game that I do sincerely recommend.\n\n10/10 -would play again-","May 18, 2014","true","40.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game takes place in a land named 'Ferelden', where your custom character is set on a quest to save world from a blight, which is pretty much a zombie uprising. This is one of the greatest games I have ever played, I was put off when I first watched gameplay, the tatical camera options seemed rather dull. After actually playing the game I was proven wrong, the game controls amazingly and the tatical camera brings a whole new style to dark fantasy genre. While you travel you will meet many different companions, who are well voiced and have many lines of dialogue. Characters can be romanced and have their own personal quest lines, as is the standard with bioware games.\n\nThe lore in this series is fantastic, taking much inspiration from Christianity an other major religions to form is own religion which is constantly brought into question by events in the game. The character creation is a bit lacking, with low amounts or hair styles and such. The voice options for your character are often quite misleding. If you select a 'soft' voice option, for a hero type character, you may find your character yelling very out of character things when going into combat.\n\nThere could be a better selection of armour in the game, as "The holy god armour of not dying" looks the same, but with different shading to, "Your nan's dressing gown armour lvl 1". Same can be said with the swords.\n\nThe game can be pretty funny at times, there's some comedy mixed in that always made me laugh, such as one of my stoic companions offering a guard some cookies he stole off a fat child. Companions can also have quite funny conversations as you roam around the land. The affection system could be a bit more advanced, you can leave an entire city to burn and your companions just forgive you if you give them a gift.\n\nThe soundtrack is great, and the main menu music is great, sometimes I just sit there listening to it for a while.\n\nThe game is very long, even without completing he side quests, and the dungeons are huge. The 'Awakening' DLC is nearly as long as the original game, and doesn't cost much at all. The awakening DLC also let's you meet characters introduced in other dragon age games.\n\nIf you want a game which really sucks you in, this is the best choice. 9.8/10\n\nIf you enjoy this, you can go to EA Origin to download 'Dragon Age: [REDACTED]', and 'Dragon Age: Inquistion'.","January 5, 2015","true","35.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I ADORE this game. It is absolutely worth it to buy the Ultimate Edition-however, I bought it on sale for $7.40 (midweek madness is GODSEND). The extra content is very useful (there's items, gifts and and even 2 map locations, as well as an additional party member) and the additional campaigns are very fun.\nThe story is very well developed, as are the characters. They're very vivid. The graphics are also fabulous. What I love the most about the story is how OPTIONAL it is; you can skip cutscenes by pressing escape, as well as dialogue. Much of the story comes from talking to NPC's as well as your party members, so if you are not a fan of story and are just there for the gameplay, you can easily skip it and go about your business.\nThe gameplay itself can be tricky for those not familiar with the tactics system. I played Final Fantasy 12 and there they called it "gambit" system, where basically you can set up a list of tasks for each character to go through during a battle, which makes more strategy possible. However, unlike Final Fantasy 12's gambit system, selecting a character will prevent them from going through their tactics; they will only perform those tasks automatically if you're NOT using them. But if you don't want to set up each individual task, or aren't sure what you'll need, you can select from the premade tactics.\nAlso, an important note: leveling up can be difficult because monsters don't respawn. For this reason, I recommend exploring as much as you can and completing a few side quests. There's tons of side quests available in almost every town you visit.\nThe exploration CAN be a little linear, though. For example, you are unable to jump over objects or vault from cliffs (that was fun in Fable 2). Plus, when traveling from town to town, you go to a loading screen, and observe the map as you travel. There are random encounters that can occur, but it's definitely not as free exploration like Skyrim or Oblivion.\nAll in all, this game is a lot of fun, and it just draws you in. I am very glad I purchased it. I tell all of my friends to buy this game because it's so incredible :)","January 29, 2014","true","182.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It pairs challenging tactical battles with excellent plot and an interesting setting. The graphics are good for such a large open game during the time it was made and even if they aren't as amazing as current days, it does not subtract from it. What I found to be the best part about this game was that each battle I had to fight differently. Each one had the possibility of defeat, and their were rarely any easy battles that I didn't have to think while fighting. Also, story wise, the greatest part in my opinion were the characters. I did not dislike a single one of them, and they each one of them I related and cared about. Overall this game is one of the greatest RPG games I have ever played, and if you enjoy RPGs and haven't picked this up, do so now.","December 8, 2013","true","34.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The lore of this game is huge and always interesting to read.\n\nThe music is beautiful and Aubrey Ashburn has a beautiful voice. The Voice acting is top-notch as well.\n\nThe combat is tactic-based with some micromanaging but that depends on the difficulty you are playing. You don't have to use tactics, but it will make the gameplay a breeze to play. If you don't like the speed of the combat, there is mod to speed it up.\n\nThere is also a website full of Dragon Age mods. I highly recommend playing the game vanilla mode, however.\n\nThe graphics are okay. But don't let it color your choice of purchasing this amazing game.\n\nAnyways, I highly recommend buying this game and giving it a chance.","December 10, 2013","true","546.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's not a gigantic roadblock, and there haven't been any game breaking moments.

It doesn't prevent me from recommending the game, as it is superb, but if you are low on patience with games, you might want to leave this one aside, as it has bugs that have no excuse not to be fixed.","June 30, 2014","true","41.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You'll battle creatures like the undead, dark monsters, and surprisingly a few dragons.\nThis is Biowares classical style of game, where the main character is a mute and there's a lot of detail to the world you inhabbit. I do prefer Dragon Age 2's voice acting and some of the characters, however in this game when you make a character from the start you have the freedom to make a human, elf or a dwarf and a choice of different backgrounds to start the story from. Whether you want to be a human noble or an Elf ranger, as well as the choice of class for your character, of which it is limited to 3: Warrior, Rogue and Mage. It would have been better if there were more of a variety of classes like the Elder Scrolls, or even their own game Mass Effect which has sci-fi rpg classes of about 6.\n\nDragon Age: Origins is a must have if you are an RPG nut and you like fantasy worlds inhabbited by Elves and Dwarves.","December 10, 2013","true","38.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I don't want to go into a long review, but I will say a few short things. First, the combat is generally fun. It has its downfall's, but the tactical camera, numerous amounts of perks, and ability to switch characters always breathes life into combat. The graphics actually aren't terrible considering how old the game is. If that sort of thing really matters, go to Nexus Mods and install whatever you see fit. DA:O's story is fantastic. At first, I had to push my self to keep playing, but once I got to the open world the hours just flew by. There is a considerable amount of lore that I recommend you learn (it makes the whole experience more enjoyable), but it is not required. The DLC is a blast, no problems there. If you're interested in Dragon Age: Inquisition, I STRONGLY recommend you play Dragon Age: Origins. Playing Dragon Age: II would be handy, but I wouldn't consider it essential.

It is easy to understand and is really fun. 10/10 CCC Media MEDIA TO THE MAX!!!\n","November 25, 2013","true","65.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I owned it on console before I managed to get it for PC, so I've had a fairly long experience with this game.\n\nThis was the first BioWare game I had ever played, and while it took me a while to get really into it (I didn't own it at first so I didn't have much time for immersion), it's one of my favorite games. You get to play as 16 different combinations of class, race, and gender, each personalizing your intro sequence and every interaction you get to be apart of in the game.

You're brought into a world where every choice you make has an affect on another aspect.\n\nAll in all, I love this game to bits, and while after playing the other games in the series it may get pretty tedious to play through Origins again, it's always nice to return to the roots of the franchise and see how far the series has come.\n\n10/10","July 20, 2015","true","79.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What to say, it's like the old-time RPG where the combat is simple yet strategic and the story is deep with lots of detail. I've played this and awakening on the Xbox and I enjoyed it all. When I saw the Ultimate Edition for sale on Steam, I wasn't thinking of how long it was going to take to finish the game. No, I was thinking of the emersion that it previously brought to me and how I wanted to visit that. Most games you complete once and cannot do again since the emotion is ruined, but Dragon Age is something that I'm able to pick up and enjoy. I actually enjoy the dialogue and quests more so than the combat. The voice acting, the expressions, the movement, the atmosphere, everything just works.\n\nThe PC version is much cleaner than the console versions and adds some new features which makes it more the reason to pick up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bleuhy/recommended/47810/","bleuhy","Miru","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bleuhy/","139 products in account","One of the best (and proper) RPGs I have ever played1st I would like to mention: Give this game a chance. I know many people who try it for an hour and think "nope, not gonna play it", please give it a chance, because it is a fun and a interesting game full of lore.\n\nSome RPGs are different from others. Some have small role-playing tactics and others, are full-on RPG mad.\n\nI like to think DA:O is the happy medium of the two.\nThis game, and it's series, is incredibly fun. You choose a race (Human, Dwarf or Elf), a class for that race and then make your character etc. There are 6 different intros to the game, depending on your race & class, it's fun to try them all out. This is one of the key points that I miss later in the series.\n\nPros:\n+Amazing dialogue, funny parts are funny and serious is serious, with parts mixed in together.\n+Fantastic characters, especially the companions.\n+Can romance the companions - a beautifully written build up when working up the relationship scale.\n(+)If lazy, you can just gift your "want-to-be-loved-one" lots of gifts so they like you.\n(+)Also get certain party members to get angry, if you cheat on them with another party member.\n+The story is fantastic, it pulls you in. By the end, you just want to save the world.\n+The end battle is fun and energetic, you will want to win.\n+The story wraps up very nice at the end.\n+ALL your decisions matter.\n+Beautiful soundtrack\n+Lots of decisions & dialogue options\n+Different endings based on your choices.\n+FANTASTIC DLC ALSO!!!\n\nNow the cons:\n-The fade, is terrible. As you have to keep going around and around, you will probably lose your mind because it is crazy! WOULD recommend getting a mod to avoid it - especially if you are replaying.\n-Some of the graphics are a bit bad, but that is expected.\n-The fighting is very "point & click" and tactical, if you dislike games like this, do not get it as there is a lot of fighting.\n\nOverall:\nA fantastic, enjoyable game. Full of laughs, tears and happiness. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys RPGs and tactical fighting. You will die of laughter, and you will want to keep playing. Even now, I still come back to this game and start it all over again, by trying different conversation options and see how it changes the story. DA:O is one of my favourite games and one of my favourite game series, although DA2 isn't as "good", I would say that, if you enjoyed this one, get DA2 & DA:I so you can get the entire story. Also, if you haven't I would also recommend the Mass Effect series, which was done by the same people who made this game.\n10/10 one of my favourites.","February 24","true","91.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was weary at first, but I cannot express how glad I am that I bought this game. The storyline was simply brilliant; I loved how I could choose to be an evil jerk who is rude to everyone, or be a heroic nobleman, and depending on what I did the whole outcome of the story was changed. Also, this game is filled with great cutscenes. As for the fighting, I didn't really like it at first, but it grew on me, and now I'd hate to have it any other way. The only downfalls were that after I finished the game, I felt empty, as if there was nothing as good worth living for anymore, and that when I made a second character and pursued the same romance as the first, I felt like I was cheating on my first character with the second :/\n\nThis is Bioware at it's finest.

What to say, it's like the old-time RPG where the combat is simple yet strategic and the story is deep with lots of detail. I've played this and awakening on the Xbox and I enjoyed it all. When I saw the Ultimate Edition for sale on Steam, I wasn't thinking of how long it was going to take to finish the game. No, I was thinking of the emersion that it previously brought to me and how I wanted to visit that. Most games you complete once and cannot do again since the emotion is ruined, but Dragon Age is something that I'm able to pick up and enjoy. I actually enjoy the dialogue and quests more so than the combat. The voice acting, the expressions, the movement, the atmosphere, everything just works.\n\nThe PC version is much cleaner than the console versions and adds some new features which makes it more the reason to pick up. I got it for $7.50! That's a steal of a deal!","December 11, 2013","true","8.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Every choice you make has consequenses in the game, every character in game has its own story, eaven the main charcter. You feel every charcter's personality. That's what makes it so good.\n\nThe game is big, you will likely be playing for many hours ahead. Many sidequests; aswell as main story is rather big as well. A huge +.\n\nThe graphics is also very good. Depending on your computer of course, it doesn't require extreme graphics on computer for just running though.

The best part about the game is that you can make choices so you don't just have to do exactly what the game thinks you should do. You unlock different achievements for taking certain paths, you end up having people turn against you, or you completely change the direction of the game; it's absolutely marvelous. You can make characters fall in love, you can make the decision to kill someone or save them. The battle scenes are amazing, the story was so heartfelt, dark, and powerful; I actually remember the game bringing me to tears at one point.\n\nI recommend this game for ANYONE who loves a great RPG with a fantasy storyline.

Fulfilling, funny, and completely engaging from start to finish. Minor flaws are forgivable and ignorable for the most part. Absolutely brilliant.\n\nSlightly less quick review:\nPros:\n\n+ Overall gameplay is fantastic – flaws are not overly bothersome.\n+ Main storyline is excellent – very satisfying and great value for money in terms of length, involvement, and balance of fetch-type quests vs more intricate jobs.\n+ Side quests are interesting and don’t feel like chores.\n+ Character development is perfect – you’ll want to do those side quests!\n+ Customisation: great choice of unique starting points and character builds makes for unrivalled replay value.\n+ Incredible writing. Draws you in from the very start with whichever character build and story you’ve chosen and is genuinely hilarious at times.\n+ Voice acting is fantastic.\n+ Well-developed and immersive world build and lore, but not boring.\n+ Decisions actually matter.\n+ Great soundtrack.\n+ Good mod support.\n\nCons:\n\n- Graphics are a bit outdated – high settings or a couple of mods can help, but it’s not horrendous.\n- Combat mechanics aren’t perfect – a bit slow at times and it takes some getting used to.\n- You might cry a bit.\n- You might also laugh till you pee a little.\n\nDown to business:\nJust as a starter, I adore this game. It’s one of my all-time favourites. The DA franchise is amazing, and although Origins is no spring chicken, it has aged well. On higher settings the game still has spectacular moments, graphically speaking, and the mid-low range settings are playable and artistically enjoyable, although not the best by any means. But you won’t care. At all.\n\nIf you’re looking for an entertaining, fulfilling, thoroughly immersive RPG with brilliant writing and touching character development, grab this. As someone who has also read the Dragon Age novels because she was desperate for more, I can tell you the world build is incredible – the lore is well structured, believable, and gripping. But for those of you who don’t want to read codex or journal entries, with this, you really don’t need to – you’ll be drawn in by the game itself, which expertly takes you through a robust storyline and gives you just the right amount of info to keep you interested without being boring or overwhelming.\n\nYour companions will give you feels. Some you’ll hate, some will make you laugh, and some you’ll go full Hulk mode to protect.\n\nAs far as mechanics go, it’s not perfect – combat is a little slow and clunky at times, and it can take a little while to get used to. The multitude of tactical options and talent customisations available may be a little overwhelming to start with, especially if you’re not used to RPG builds. However, this is more than compensated for. Put simply, you can play whichever way you want. If you enjoy micromanaging and tactical play, the game deals very well with this. If you’d rather be more hands-on, or a mixture of both, go ahead – the AI is pretty good at letting your party get on with it while you smash some darkspawn skulls in with a sword as long as your own body, or go full mage-rage and burn someone to a crisp.\n\nAs for your actual character – the game does the (mostly) silent protagonist thing very well. It takes nothing away from the enjoyment of this game. The voice acting as a whole is excellent – very believable, very natural, and the right amount of comic relief vs. dramatic, feel-inducing bits. It’s all very epic but not over-acted.\n\nThe story customisation is second to none. At the start of the game, you can build your male or female character from scratch (or just use the presets) – human, elf, or dwarf; warrior, rogue or mage; noble or bottom of the pile - these options DO make a huge difference to the story. Replay value is amazing. You basically have multiple different games, and the choices you make as you progress shape the world around you as you deal with the Blight.\n\nAs far as DLC goes, Awakening is brilliant. You can take your story and character forward from the ending of Origins itself, or you can create another new one! It’s another good chunk of gameplay, with fantastic characters and plenty more to do.\n\nThe other extras are great value too – not to spoil anything, they’re perfect for those wanting a little more from certain characters, and are well worth the play time.\n\nMoving forward to DA:2, you can take your Origins story along with you – yay for transferrable save files! Or you can custom-build a story if you weren’t exactly happy with your Origins playthrough and can’t be arsed to do another one. What more could you want?\n\nOverall, DA:O is one of the best RPGs I’ve played to date. The characters, the world, and the general gameplay are too much fun to be dented by the flaws in mechanics. It’s something I will happily replay over and over again.","June 16, 2015","true","163.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

What about Planescape: Torment? Icewind Dale? Mass effect with swords and deeper character interaction? Dragon Age: Origins was made by BioWare, the makers of Baldur's Gate, to be the spiritual successor to that very same Baldur's Gate. Imagine that! Spoiler Alert: They succeeded with that.  While not without it's minor flaws, Dragon Age: Origins has the deepest dialogue and interaction with NPC party members since... well, Baldur's Gate. It's not *as* deep as Baldur's Gate or Torment, but it is certainly deeper than Mass Effect. Anyone who enjoyed any of those games should play this. Oh, and don't play Dragon Age 2. It's crap, and was really dumbed down to be a straight console game rather than a PC RPG ported to console. It's really dull, so unless that's your thing just pass on the sequel.","May 2, 2013","true","18.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drgerm/recommended/47810/","drgerm","DrGerm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drgerm/","196 products in account","Crashes and Freezes abound in this game. I remember having problems when originally trying to play the game in 2009 and for some reason it's worse with modern day (2014) hardware.\n\nThat aside, DA is a classic. A quick history: BioWare originally gained fame by creating isometric tactical RPGs in the Dungeons and Dragons (Forgotten Realms) setting. I never looked this up, but my guess is that some suit at Hasbro wasn't able to continue that relationship with BioWare (and ultimately Electronic Arts) and so they created their own setting to create a franchise around at or around which became the Dragon Age universe.\n\nIn contrast to the High Fantasy themes of Forgotten Realms, the campaign setting of Dragon Age is more Low Fantasy or Dark Fantasy. Magic is to be feared, the mood is dark and gritty, you are surrounded by despair and (to some degree) magic items are a little rare. Also in contrast to any D&D setting, characters do not seem to have direct relationships with gods (or Gods) and do not attain magical powers (i.e. healing) from them. In other words, there are healing schools in magic and no clerics.\n\nDifferences in the campaign aside, DA is EXACTLY what you would expect from a BioWare game. You have exactly the same viewpoint and controls as seen in Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and Neverwinter. Interactions with NPCs and companions is exactly as you would see in Mass Effect (which is the natural extension of the previously mentioned games).\n\nLots of replay value is inherent with the different starting areas, different ways in which to approach quests and companions and multiple side quests. However, not NEARLY as much open endness within the world if you are to compare to a Bethesda, Elder Scrolls game. Multiple mods exist to enhance the game as well (check Nexus Mods)\n\nDA is a classic RPG. Whether you like it or not, however, depends on your style of RPG. Obviously it's a single player game. It's not a JRPG. It's not as open as Elder Scrolls. Tactics are of moderate importance within encounters. Lots of scripted (voice acted) dialogue with NPCs with 'some' variation, but in the end moderately rail-roaded.","November 9, 2014","true","79.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/recommended/47810/","emperorgandhi","[CotC] King Conga Gandhi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/","194 products in account","Dragon Age: Origins was made by Bioware almost 5 years ago already. This RPG is definitely good, but how good is it?\n\nThe visuals at times can be the worst part of the game. It is from 2009, and I hate comparing games unless I have a reason to. But I'm going to look at Mass Effect 1. The graphics were pretty nice in that game, but these visuals are just, wow. Describing it would be like describing the taste of soup to someone with no tongue. Although it is a bit more fit for a top-down view (which could explain the below average textures) it could've used some serious work in the third-person view. However, it isn't flat out awful like it may seem. In some places, the game looks gorgeous. This game doesn't really stand out in the graphics department, though.\n\nThe gameplay, is simply a click an enemy and use abilities type of game. But, it takes this format and adds more to it like the class trees, positioning of your party members, selecting party members, and even playing as them. If you're an action RPG fan, you will NOT like the combat. Well, to be honest, there are actually only a few action RPGs that actually had solid gameplay. In the end, you realize that the gameplay isn't the sharpest sword on the rack, but it's still actually very, very complex in a good way. A very good way.\n\nThe story is overused with the whole "evil rising" thing to it. I'll use the Mass Effect trilogy as my victim again- I mean my "example" again. Heh, heh... Anyway, Mass Effect's story is based on the Reaper's return as the ultimate evil. Dragon Age's is similar. The Reapers are replaced with the Darkspawn and instead of the Alliance and all of them, you have the Grey Wardens. Since I have high expectations for Bioware's games that are four years old or older because those games haven't entrely succumbed to EA, the story didn't meet my expectations, and is probably a key weakpoint in the game.\n\nThe audio is impressive, and the voice actors did a pretty great job playing their roles. The songs are amazing, but at times the songs can seem a bit funky. Especially in combat. Sometimes you hear cheery dance music playing. Other times you hear epic choir intense music that perfectly fits in with the battle. Overall though, I really like it.\n\nNow we're talking about the Ultimate Edition. I'm not surprised the replayability in this game is so good. You have a bunch of DLCs that will keep you busy, along with the fact you can try to beat the game with every backstory as every class and race. Massive replayability will probably keep you in for about 120 hours, based on what I've seen. The replayability is probably the strongest point to this game thanks to the DLCs that are provided.\n\nIn the end, Dragon Age: Origins is a very good RPG, but has major issues like the poor graphics at times, the random themed music, and the below average plot for a Bioware game. However, the high replayability, strong gameplay, and amazing music are able to keep you in for an amazing ride in a brutal world that Bioware crafts perfectly. It doesn't stand head to head with Baldur's Gate or Mass Effect, but Dragon Age: Origins is one dark and awesome adventure you don't want to miss.\n\nGraphics- 5/10\nGameplay- 7/10\nStory- 4.5/10\nAudio- 8.5/10\nReplayability- 10/10\n\n.:8.2/10:.\n+Strong music\n+Dark atmosphere\n+High replayability\n+Good gameplay\n-Weak plot\n-Random themed music in combat\n-Weak visuals at times","July 9, 2014","true","14.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I've played through it at least four times on console, and then some. A perfect combination of old and new, Origins appeals to fans of RPGs old and new.\n\nThe game itself plays out like your typical Dungeons & Dragons inspired affair, with a wide variety of skills, attributives and abilities that govern the outcome of multiple scenarios. Though the combat animations can be a bit sluggish and dull, winning fights takes some degree of cunning and strategy, especially on the higher difficulties. More than any other game I've seen, this one takes managing your party to a whole new level. For fans of strategy games, this game will more than satisfy your inner tactician with its myriad of planning options for each and every consistency.\n\nYou pick from the standard three classes: rouge, warrior and mage. However, the more open-ended structure of the leveling system allows for a lot more nuance and depth than your average dice roller. For example, on my second playthrough, I decided to be a mage. And whilst being a mage in this game is the most fun I've ever had as a mage in any game, I still prefer the path of the warrior. With a couple specialisations that I unlocked in the game, I was able to craft a battlemage that fit my tastes perfectly, capable of rushing foes down with a battleaxe and heavy armours and able to switch to a fireball or living bomb spell for crowd control seamlessly.\n\nThough the setting is extremely derivative, the world's politics and inner working still manage to be intriguing with plenty of rich lore to back it up. However, it's not the world that makes exploring Thedas on your quest to save the world from an army of orcs and an evil dragon interesting. It's the characters.\n\nFor those familiar with [/i]Mass Effect[/i] will find themselves very comfortable with how [/i]Dragon Age: Origins[/i] treats party members, perhaps even more so. For almost your entire crew, you almost always have the option to kick them out, kill them or otherwise refuse your help (though you'd have to be some kind of hardcore maniac to do this). Most of them are romancable, and all of them are colourful, multi-dimensional people with their own interests, backstory, agendas and quirks. This is where making "moral" choices becomes difficult. Instead of any kind of morality meter, each of your followers have an approval rating with you. When considering your actions, you'll have to keep satisfying your party in mind as well.\n\nAnd the choices. Oh man, the choices you have to make. Some of them thought-provoking, others gut-wrenching, all of the choices you have to make are interesting, leaving plenty of room to characterise your silent protagonist. Are you a ruthless leader who refuses to compromise for your goal? Or are you a noble, naive hero who always seeks to help others? What about a greedy, power hungry sociopath? Maybe you're just a complete psycho. Whether you want to be any of these things or anything in-between, this game gives you the freedom to decide.\n\nThe plot itself is as straight forward as it gets. It's an epic albeit cliche-riddled journey as you unite the land and raise an army strong enough to face a horde of monsters and the demonic dragon that leads them. Sound familiar? Does it sounds like every fantasy game you'd ever played? Dragon Age: Origins is anything but original, however it proves the rule that it's better to do something well than to do something new and fail, as we've seen with its successor.\n\nThe plot is entirely character-driven, and though there are some eye-opening twists and turns here and there, it's a fairly simple, though well-written ride. That isn't why you play through, however. This game is made by the characters. Even if you don't enjoy the pseudo MMO-style combat, the action is highlighted by your interaction with a large cast of colourful, well-rounded characters. From the flawed human antagonist and his pure evil sidekick to the socially-inept and seemingly heartless witch to the conflicted albeit well-meaning bard, everyone has a story to tell, and you'll love hearing it.\n\nIf any of the above interests you, please don't hesitate to buy the Ultimate Edition for ten dollars more than the base game. If $29.99 seems a bit steep, wait for a sale and keep in mind that you're getting a mind-boggling amount of content here. Aside from the high replayability the open-ended character levelling system and multiple origin stories provide, you already have a base campaign that can take you tens of hours (we're talking 30+ if you take the time to talk to people and engage in side quests) with plenty to see and do.\n\nThe additional DLC is very much worth playing. The Stone Prisoner adds a unique party member with his/her own questline for you to uncover, which doesn't just add more content, it can breathe new life into the vanilla content as well. [/b]Warden's Keep[/b] is a short, but enjoyable mini quest that tasks you with clearing a new dungeon and finally siding with one of two new characters. This includes some new skills and items as well as a party chest to store your loot, though that can be done with a mod just as easily.\n\nReturn to Ostagar takes you through familiar territory, but it remains a poignant reminder of one of the most intense parts of the story, despite being little more than a remixed level with extra loot and tough enemies. If you're particularly passionate about the story and its characters, you'll get a kick out of it. Feastday Gifts and Feastday Pranks are silly nothing add-ons that can be easily overlooked on their own, but as a part of the complete package, can add some cute little extras, like cleaning the party's blood off with soap, playing fetch with your dog and having Alistair play with dolls. Good fun, but not essential or even worth buying on its own.\n\nThe Darkspawn Chronicles is a standalone campaign in which you play as the Darkspawn in a darker, alternate universe where the hero dies early on and the bad guys win. It's worth playing at least once for the amusing "what if" scenario, though I personally found it to be a bit boring without any actual dialogue or plot aside from the interesting bits of lore that detail the choices your party made and the adventures they had without you. Leliana's Song on the other hand, is a canonical standalone campaign in which you play as a younger Leliana alongside a cast of fresh faces. Their misadventures make for a fun romp, especially if you really like Leliana.\n\nThe Golems of Amgarrak is another standalone campaign, this time featuring your main character from the base game, if you so choose. This one is peppered throughout with spooky lore and a bit of dialogue, but what this DLC really nails is atmosphere. It's an oppressive adventure through the darkest parts of the fallen Dwarven kingdom that leads up to a terrifying and challenging final boss, one that is easily amongst my favourite boss battles in RPG history just for the sheer satisfaction of finally taking him/her/it down. Not to be missed for any one who enjoys the combat and a challenge, or just wants to see more of their characters adventures in Thedas.\n\nThe final add-on and the last to take place canonically, Witch Hunt features the return of your hero - again, unless you want to make a new guy with a different agenda - in search of a character from the original campaign. This standalone campaign has almost no new content in terms of the enemies you'll be fighting and the places you'll be going, but what it does have is a challenging campaign perfect for those who want answers (not that you'll necessarily get them) about the original game. Your three new party members are fun, and I only wish it was longer, just so you can spend more time with them.\n\nSo yeah, I recommend this game.","December 2, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LoremasterNick/recommended/47810/","LoremasterNick","Nick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LoremasterNick/","771 products in account","Dragon Age: Origins is BioWare at its finest. With an amazing story and great characters it is a worthy successor to one of the all time greats: Baldur's Gate. At a 30€ price point or 7.49€ during sales the Ultimate Edition is amazing value with easily over 100 hours of gameplay.\n\nIn DA:O you step into the shoes of a Grey Warden, an ancient order of warriors created to defend Thedas from the Darkspawn, during the start of the Fifth Blight. The main story takes you through the kingdom of Ferelden as you gather various forces and companions to aid you in your goal of defeating the Archdemon and ending the Blight. The various parts of the main story introduce you to the political struggles and various races and groups such as dwarves, elves and mages and can be done in a non-linear fashion. The storylines are great and have multiple branching paths to them. Where the game shines is the dialogue and interaction with NPCs and companions in particular, you have a well written and interesting group of followers with various backgrounds and goals that you get to explore through the events of the game. The massive amount of lore to explore and find out about through codex entries and dialogues with characters is very impressive, especially when you take into account that this is the first game in a series set in an original universe created by BioWare.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective DA:O is a classic CRPG: Real-time hotkey based combat with a strategic top-down view and the option to pause the game and set up your and your parties moves. The combat will definitely appeal to people who liked games like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and other RPGs of the late 90s and early 2000s. There's a wide variety of active and passive abilities unique to each class and their specializations.\n\nVisually the game was a bit dated already when it came out, if it is to be judged by graphical fidelity. The game doesn't look as good as many more modern titles, but it definitely doesn't damage the experience. The art style and design on the other hand is mostly very good and stays realistic with the armour and weapon designs. There are both brown landscapes such as the towns and their surrounding areas and lush forests and vibrant vistas.\n\nThe soundtrack by Inon Zur is great and really sets the mood well with great compositions. The quality of the voice actors is very good and the casting is great with talented people such as Claudia Black and Tim Curry putting in amazing performances.\n\nAll of the downloadable content is included in the Ultimate Edition which makes it the most ideal purchase over the only slightly cheaper base game. The expansion pack 'Awakening' comes close to capturing the feel of the main game and gives the player an additional 20+ hours of gametime. the DLCs themselves vary a lot in quality and range in length from 30 minutes to a few hours and none of them are really stellar. Despite this they are worth playing since they come at such a low bundled price and give you insight into various characters and aspects of the lore of the universe.\n\nDragon Age: Origins is a must have for any RPG fan and I truly recommend it to any gamer, at least at this low price point.","March 5, 2014","true","65.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Having said all of that, this is easily in my top 5 games of all time. I love the story line and how in depth it can get with desicions, and the desicions actually matter in dragon age, they affect quests, what people (mainly your party) think of you, and change the ending. The combat can be a little slow and clunky at times, but this doesnt really deter me. I prefer the big hot bar of spells and talents to the button mash system that is implemented in many newer RPGs (dragon age 2). If you want hours upon hours of in depth gameplay, in depth and deep if not sometimes tear jerking story, character romance, great boss fights with killer rewards then this is the game for you. I highly reccomend it, and at the price it's at now, it's more than worth it.","September 17, 2014","true","25.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is phenomenal to say the least, the characters are some of the deepest, well-thought figures in any game I've ever played, and the RPG element allows the player direct decisions on nearly every aspect of the game.  When 'epic, fantasy RPG' comes to mind, DA:O is truly the elite in it's class.  The Ultimate Edition is no exception, great price for value.\n\nI'm a long time console player with probably several hundred hours and atleast 5 playthroughs, but I have yet to complete my first playthrough of the game and all the DLC on the PC yet and already have 80+ hours logged.  You heard correctly; 80+ hours on one character and I've only completed the base game, Warden's Peak, Stone Prisoner, and Golem's of Amgarrak.  I have yet to complete Awakening, Witch Hunt, Leliana's Song, and Darkspawn Invasion.  I expect the total hours to be 120+ on one character by the time I have done everything the Ultimate Edition has to offer.  Easily one of the best values for dollar per hour spent.\n\nThe combat may be the only draw-back to the game.  Strategy-wise, it's extremely in-depth and requires much preparation on higher difficulties.  Veteran MMO players will feel right at home.  However the visuals are lacking (keeping in mind the date of release) and the whole system isn't very 'exhilarating', though you'll feel the occasional rush during a boss fight.  The combat serves its purpose and doesn't really throw any curves; it doesn't add much noteworthy additions to the game, but it certainly does not detract from the piece.\n\nThe vanilla game is stellar in itself, but the incorporation of the DA Updater allows easy organization of mods.  Mods I've found especially good include textures, re-skins, graphics, combat AI, and combat tactics.\n\nOverall, one of the best modern RPG's in existence.  Give it a shot if you haven't, you won't regret it.\n\n10/10","August 14, 2014","true","81.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a perfect combination of old school  (Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, etc...) and modern western rpgs.

Replace Darkspawns with evil Orcs, and Archdemon with Sauron...

This makes gives the combat alot of strategy, and makes it alot of fun.\nThe leveling up system is pretty standart, you get to assing points into Strenght, Endurance, Willpower and so on, pretty standart from other RPG's.\n\nThrough out the game you will meet different companions, and you get to make your own group as you see fit. This brings up the strategy again, you can make your group as you see fit, you can go all berzerk and go with 4 damage dealers, or you can even it all out, and have a tank, healer and 2 damage dealers, kinda like you own little WoW dungeon group.\nOne neat feature is you get to have actual conversations with them, and they have different personalitys, and you can earn affection points with each and every one of them. At some point's, your companions will even backstap you, if they don't like you enough.\n\nThe story in the game is great, you are a Grey Warden, the defenders of the Realm against the Dark Spawn. A race made up of monsters, demons and all that evil ♥♥♥♥, who is led by the Arch Demon ( A giant ♥♥♥ dragon ! ), you have to help the realm by gathering an army from different factions through the world, to fight the Dark Spawn horde, els all will be lost.\nIm not going to say much more on the story, but it is one of the best features of this game. The very best being YOU GET TO DECIDE HOW ITS ALL GOING TO PLAY OUT, your choices matter in the game, and will have consequenses later on.\n\nOver all DA:O is a great time, there is so much to do, and you get hundres of hours worth of gameplay. The main game is fantastic, and I'd surgest only getting the DLC if you really like the game, but even the DLC is worth it. They give you a good 3-5 hours worth of content, maybe abit more. Overall the DLC is cool, buy them if you like the game, they are like springels on a already awesome Sunday Ice Cream.\n\nNow the expansion on the other hand, is not really worth it. The story is pretty boring, it ends just as it gets interesting, and it dosnt really feel as epic, as the standart game does. The Story starts a few months after completing the main games story, you are now the Grey Warden commander, and you have to remake the Grey Wardens, by getting new people to become Grey Wardens, as said it sounds pretty cool, but in the end it is a very boring story and kind of lazy written. It's just not as good as the main story.\nThe Expansion got some cool features, like cool looking armors, a new level cap, and some other nice things.\nSure it's some hours worth of gameplay, but overall id say it's not really worth it. It feels tagged on and I would only recomend it, if you can get your hands on the Dragon Age : Origins - Ultimate Edition.\n\nI enjoyed the hell out of DA:O - Ultimate Edition, and I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes RPG's.","September 22, 2014","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I highly recommend the ultimate edition, forget the deluxe edition, and forget vanilla pay the extra money for the ultimate edition. It adds greatly to your Dragon Age experience and works well with Bioware's Dragon Age keep. At an easy setting you will run through the game in about 48 hours, but with 6 character origins options and 3 unique classes you'll come back for more.\nThe game also has strict consequences to actions - like The Witcher series more than The Elder Scrolls - so choose wisely. If you are into role playing your CRPG characters then DA: Origins is a solid option with its racial, gender and class options.\nIn terms of mods I also recommend downloading Bioware's own graphics update for  the Qunari race[social.bioware.com]. I also highly recommend using DAO-Modmanager by Altorian (this is a must have if you want to mod the game) and Dragon Age Redesigned by Dracomies and Extra Dog Slot by Dheuster. I run two or three other graphics/texture mods but to my mind these mods are necessary.\nAll in all I highly recommend DA: Origins even if it’s 5 years old. There are a few glitchy aspects to the controls but nothing major. This is a tactical combat game not an action hack and cast adventure. Like Final Fantasy or older CRPGs you’re managing a party but with the added twist of favour points which will determine whether your companions stay with you or not (although in my experience you can easily manipulate their favour at lower difficult settings to “adore” ratings by gifting regularly.\nIf you don’t like Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) inspired game systems or DnD/Tolkienesque fantasy races then this is not a game for you. Dragon Age is steep in the stock of fantasy tropes, the undead (Dark Spawn), dragons, mages, rogue, dwarves who live under mountains, demons and god-like dragons (don’t think just because you’re the chosen one you take a dragon on single-handed this is very definitely not Skyrim).  However if you do like DnD and do like the stock fantasy tropes Dragon Age: Origins offers an engaging storyline with good graphics and good tactical combat system.\nAs a backstory to DA: Inquisition Origins is a good buy, but even as a stand alone game Origins fares well as a tactical combat DnD inspired game.

It may be old and the graphics may show that a little, but surprisingly it does still hold up and is easy to look past. The characters are all amazing, it was painful to have to choose only 3 to follow you each mission, because I wanted to spend time with them all!

But the atmosphere more than makes up for any problems/glitches I have found. I have really felt like being part of the story all along the way. The characters and their background stories are great, voice acting is superb (in particular Claudia Black and Geraldine Blecker). And the whole game has an incredible sense of humor: I spent long hours playing the jailbreak scene over and over again to see the various plotlines for that part as well as tried different groups of companions to hear the different ways the characters mock each other.","December 21, 2014","true","121.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The biggest downside to the game is the story is tried, tired and done a thousand times over. You the hero are on quest to destroy the dark spawn that is wreaking havoc on the land. This being its biggest downfall does not make this a bad game at all. I had over 40+ hours in one play through and with all the decision making you encounter this game will surely keep you amused for multiple plays. One of the best combat systems I've seen you can not only setup the AI to have your companions on the quest do what you like but you can fully take control of them which in my opinion is a huge advantage. The combat system is a little bit of learning curve but once you get the hang of it you will love it and enjoy the simpleness of how your characters act and follow your directions in the heat of some best battles you will see in an RPG. Bioware did an excellent job in creating a game you can fully plunge yourself into and get behind.","August 12, 2014","true","64.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's well able to keep up to classic's like Baldurs Gate or Diablo. I would considers this the best modern RPG there is on the market. The story is great, the gameplay can be very challenging. Be aware if you don't like to read or immerse yourself in the game though, there is a lot of dialogue and things to read; wether you like that is up to you. Your small team that you build up over time, is great. Everyone has a great background story, wether it be Zevran from the Crows of Antiva or Alistair as (almost) former Templar. The world is big; there are many factions that you can read about. The Chantry, The Crows of Antiva, The Circle (of Magi). For those who can't get enough, there are many sidequests which are optional, but give you a good way of earning some gold.\n\nOverall the game is a clear 10/10 for me, a must play.

Dragon Age... Dragon Age... Where to begin? Well this game was made in 2009 (I think), so giving that it's around 4-5 years old, It's pretty fun to play. The main story is not only vast, but intense as you're protecting the realm, nay the human population from the inevitable Blight as the ever popular hero among the 'Grey Wardens'.\nThe combat system isn't too shabby, and the leveling up system (Skill tree) is pretty neat also. The main thing which does it for me however (like the Mass Effect series), is the dialogue. You can even level up your coercion skill which provides 'intimidate' and 'persuade' options during dialogue cutscenes.\nAlong with the fact that the campaign is amazing, there are HUNDREDS of side quests (as expected) to achieve!\nNow so far, this review has been based upon 'Dragon Age: Origins', yet I feel I should also take a moment to talk about it's expansion 'Awakening'...\nOther than additional DLC for this game (Wardens Keep, The Stone Prisoner etc) Dragon Age: Awakening opens up yet another vast campaign which continues from 'Origins'. This places your main character (which can be imported over from a previous save, or created from level 20) into what becomes Vigils Keep, the home of the Grey Wardens. You soon discover that although the Blight has been prevented and the Archdemon killed, Darkspawn are still at large and taking orders from someone, or something...\n\nCutting this review short, whether you buy this game (preferably the Ultimate Edition with all DLCs) in a sale or not, you will not be disappointed.\nYou will however, be disappointed if you play Dragon Age 2, which I will not get started on...\n\nOverall, 8-9 / 10!","March 31, 2014","true","90.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Aside from the Elder Scrolls series, I don't know any games that will give you more bang for your buck than Dragon Age (: Origins - Ultimate Edition). If you go through all the DLC and finish most of the sidequests in the game you'll easily spend over 100 hours on a single run, and there were hardly any points in the game where I felt like the plot was starting to drag.\n\nThe gameplay is good overall. I do think the strategy elements were sometimes a bit tedious though. I didn't like pausing battles every 0.5 seconds to give all of my characters new orders and it was also difficult sometimes to get my characters to do exactly what I wanted them to, when I wanted them to. The AI is not as bad as in Mass Effect 1, but I still often had to deal with things like my ranged fighter throwing herself into melee combat rather than keeping distance and my assassin attacking enemies head on rather than trying to backstab. The game does provide you with Tactics slots to tell your characters in advance how to respond to situations in battle, but that takes a lot of time to set up and doesn't always give good results.\n\nAs with most BioWare games (KOTOR, Mass Effect), they've put a lot of effort into developing the main characters and giving them intruiging backstories. However, in Dragon Age I feel like they've even taken it a few steps further. Each individual character gets lots of 'screen time' (if you bother to talk to them) and the romance sidequest has been worked out a lot more than in their previous games. One of the gameplay elements is a 'relationship' system that will make choices you make during the game affect your relationship with your party members. A good relationship will make characters befriend you or fall in love with you (revealing more of the character's backstory), a bad relationship might make the character leave the party permanently. Personally, I really loved this and wish more RPGs had this.\n\nWhat I particularly loved about this game is that the choices that you face during the development of the plot aren't always as straightforward as picking a good or bad option. You will face plenty of dillemmas in which it is not so obvious what the outcome of your choices will be and you'll feel compelled to apply your own moral reasoning to the situation. In the end, this makes it feel more like you're actually playing as yourself (or a realistic human being) and not someone who's putting up a goody-two-shoes / bad-♥♥♥ act.\n\nAnyway, I enjoyed Dragon Age a lot. I think it will please any fan of the RPG genre. It's a very well-made game overall that is more than worth the €7,50 I paid for it during the Sale.","December 24, 2013","true","135.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And when it did finish I was left satisfied yet wanting more. A truly immersive experience, I found myself talking to my companions, and laughing at their bickering. It features a great storyline with a different outcome depending on your choices. There is a bit of a morale system in that certain companions will like or dislike your actions and you will gain or lose reputation with them. Some companions have different morals than others so you can choose to take those who will agree with your choices and thus gain rep with them. However for the most part you'll want to choose your companions based on what classes/spells you need for battles. This game can be brutally hard with battles, but it does have a difficulty option which can be changed at any time.\n\nIf you're a fan of RPG's this is a must-play. It features immersive towns and people, all of which have something to do or say. The world is full and rich, with no "empty" spots.\n\nHowever, the story is somewhat linear, so if you skip something you may not be able to go back later if you go forward in the main quest. Side quests are aplenty as are companions. You may struggle with bag space as you never know what you might need. I got around this by avoiding the crafting specialisations and selling the materials. This left room for all the loot.\n\nAll in all, I'd give this a 9.5/10.

The story keeps a nice pace that doesn't leave you tired (except Orzammar; that started getting a little old), and has an ending that gives you some real choices that change the outcome dramatically.  The DLC for this game (comes with Ultimate, no need to purchase) is equally as well done and equally as engaging, with some nice rewards.\n\nCombat may be my biggest gripe in this game, but there are enough abilities to keep it feeling fresh for a while.  Zooming all the way out to make it a top-down strategy RPG helped the experience dramatically, but by the end of the game, I'd felt it started to get a little long in the tooth.  The animations are somewhat lacking, however, which can sometimes make combat boring to watch.  Managing healing and stamina/mana expenditure usually will keep you pretty engaged, however.\n\nAll in all, I think Dragon Age is a great example of Bioware's quality and commitment to their product during their highest point.  I hope that their games in the future will return to this level of fidelity and aesthetic, and continue to engage the player on multiple levels.","July 8, 2013","true","52.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It is a perfect combination of old school  (Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, etc...) and modern western rpgs.  It has a rich universe that tries to differentiates itself from the usual Tolkien bases (though I believe it is still very close to the classics...  Replace Darkspawns with evil Orcs, and Archdemon with Sauron...  But that is not a turn off at all...)\n\nThe tactical gameplay is very fun, the player is at the center of the story line and the many dialogues make you actually care about the other characters and NPCs.  There are several important choices that significantly change the story line.  I am curious to know what's Bioware's canon for this game.  Last but not least, this Ultimate Edition has all the DLCs and I really enjoyed most of them (Awakening is a respectable +20 hours campaign).\n\nI will definitely miss the epic tale of my Grey Warden but I am also looking forward to discover the story of Hawke and the Inquisitor (DA2 & 3)!

Dragon Age... Dragon Age... Where to begin? Well this game was made in 2009 (I think), so giving that it's around 4-5 years old, It's pretty fun to play. The main story is not only vast, but intense as you're protecting the realm, nay the human population from the inevitable Blight as the ever popular hero among the 'Grey Wardens'.\nThe combat system isn't too shabby, and the leveling up system (Skill tree) is pretty neat also. The main thing which does it for me however (like the Mass Effect series), is the dialogue. You can even level up your coercion skill which provides 'intimidate' and 'persuade' options during dialogue cutscenes.\nAlong with the fact that the campaign is amazing, there are HUNDREDS of side quests (as expected) to achieve!\nNow so far, this review has been based upon 'Dragon Age: Origins', yet I feel I should also take a moment to talk about it's expansion 'Awakening'...\nOther than additional DLC for this game (Wardens Keep, The Stone Prisoner etc) Dragon Age: Awakening opens up yet another vast campaign which continues from 'Origins'. This places your main character (which can be imported over from a previous save, or created from level 20) into what becomes Vigils Keep, the home of the Grey Wardens. You soon discover that although the Blight has been prevented and the Archdemon killed, Darkspawn are still at large and taking orders from someone, or something...\n\nCutting this review short, whether you buy this game (preferably the Ultimate Edition with all DLCs) in a sale or not, you will not be disappointed.\nYou will however, be disappointed if you play Dragon Age 2, which I will not get started on...\n\nOverall, 8-9 / 10!","March 31, 2014","true","90.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Aside from the Elder Scrolls series, I don't know any games that will give you more bang for your buck than Dragon Age (: Origins - Ultimate Edition). If you go through all the DLC and finish most of the sidequests in the game you'll easily spend over 100 hours on a single run, and there were hardly any points in the game where I felt like the plot was starting to drag.\n\nThe gameplay is good overall. I do think the strategy elements were sometimes a bit tedious though. I didn't like pausing battles every 0.5 seconds to give all of my characters new orders and it was also difficult sometimes to get my characters to do exactly what I wanted them to, when I wanted them to. The AI is not as bad as in Mass Effect 1, but I still often had to deal with things like my ranged fighter throwing herself into melee combat rather than keeping distance and my assassin attacking enemies head on rather than trying to backstab. The game does provide you with Tactics slots to tell your characters in advance how to respond to situations in battle, but that takes a lot of time to set up and doesn't always give good results.\n\nAs with most BioWare games (KOTOR, Mass Effect), they've put a lot of effort into developing the main characters and giving them intruiging backstories. However, in Dragon Age I feel like they've even taken it a few steps further. Each individual character gets lots of 'screen time' (if you bother to talk to them) and the romance sidequest has been worked out a lot more than in their previous games. One of the gameplay elements is a 'relationship' system that will make choices you make during the game affect your relationship with your party members. A good relationship will make characters befriend you or fall in love with you (revealing more of the character's backstory), a bad relationship might make the character leave the party permanently. Personally, I really loved this and wish more RPGs had this.\n\nWhat I particularly loved about this game is that the choices that you face during the development of the plot aren't always as straightforward as picking a good or bad option. You will face plenty of dillemmas in which it is not so obvious what the outcome of your choices will be and you'll feel compelled to apply your own moral reasoning to the situation. In the end, this makes it feel more like you're actually playing as yourself (or a realistic human being) and not someone who's putting up a goody-two-shoes / bad-♥♥♥ act.\n\nAnyway, I enjoyed Dragon Age a lot. I think it will please any fan of the RPG genre. It's a very well-made game overall that is more than worth the €7,50 I paid for it during the Sale.","December 24, 2013","true","135.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

An amazing addition that I enjoyed the whole way through as it changes with each combination of characters you elect to your party.

Unlike many Bioware games there is no overall karma meter in this game; rather, you have individiual approval ratings for each companion you pick up. Rather, Bioware does a good job at deconstructing standard fantasy games by putting in several morally complex choices that have no "right" answer, and you are asked to choice between what is right, and what will ultimately help save the world.\n\nAs per Bioware fashion, characters you meet and pick up are diverse and intriguing and overall well written. DO NOT SIMPLY WRITE OFF CHARACTERS; like some of the choices in this game they are often more complex than they initially appear.\n\nGameplay is set up with your typical warrior, rogue and mage builds, topped off with choosing your own race. This is even given some story significance; your combination of race and class will have its own "origin story" to play, and rest assured that whatever issues you face there will come back to haunt you later. Combat resembles tactical RPGs with a pause function and a tactical overview to get a better sense of layout of the battle. You can control team members individually and even set tactics for each. The downside to gameplay is that combat can be dull to some, and (if you're not into it) micromanaging is rampant in this game. Mages can be ridiculously OP depending on the build, and perhaps because of this there isn't a very good balance in classes in terms of the companions you gather, in my opinion.\n\nOverall, in my personal opinion this is a great game to have if you're a fan of fantasy RPGs. With the Ultimate Edition you get your money's worth, even if you buy full price. Lots of content built in to sink hours into, and if you want some more personal touches you can add mods to the game to spice some things up.","June 18, 2013","true","179.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While it may be showing its age graphics-wise, that does not detract anything from the game. You play as the "Warden", a player-created and customized character. The visual options are few in number, but you can easily amend this with mods. You can choose from three races and three classes. Each class has certain specializations that unlock as you level up.\n\nThe main storyline itself is not the most original thing ever, but it's still a damn good one. There are a lot of decisions you have to make along the way that will impact the world AND the later games, if you choose to go on. While there are endings that can be considered happier than others, there are many decisions that are morally ambiguous.\n\nWhat really makes the story, though, are the well-written characters you run into. I think they're one of the main reasons why I love this game so much. You will have party members that clash in personality or get along just fine. As for their relationships with your character, there's an "approval" mechanic for each companion, impacted by the decisions you make and the gifts you give them. Hell, one of them might actually leave the party and try to kill you, if they do not approve of you too much. Four of the possible companions are also romanceable.\n\nThe combat isn't fluid, but that's because it heavily relies on the tactical side. You can pause during battles, control each companion in your party, and tell them to do X if Y. If you're new to the game, easy difficulty is the way to go. Or, if you really want a challenge, there are two harder modes.\n\nDragon Age: Origins is a solid 10/10. I've lost way too many hours of my life on this game.","January 16, 2015","true","154.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I had already played dragon age before but none of the dlcs or awakening. Dragon age is a fantastic game for those who enjoy fantasy rpgs with turn based fighting. The world is beautiful, the story is detailed, the characters are colorful and a long game to enjoy every single moment. If you like the Kotor games then you'd like this. The DLC's were fun but as normal they are quite short. You have Leilana's song to learn about her background. Darkspawn invasion allowes you to enjoy being a darkspawn. Shale is a great add on character. Return to Ostagar and Wardens keep are decent small maps. Awakening is very well done with tons of new skills. Witch hunt is decent but short. The Golems of Angnarok is good but the final boss is way to hard in my opinion. All in all, a great series and I had a ton of fun replaying again.

I did a full playthrough of the base game, DLC, and expansion when I had it for the PS3.  A very cool story, good combat.  You can also pause the game to tell your characters what to do in advance, if you're not able to keep up with the combat normally.  It's a pretty challenging game, and it has a ton of content even without the DLC and expansion.  The character customization I feel could've been a bit better but it's good enough.  Meet lots of interesting characters, and travel around with 3 other characters of your choosing as you meet them along the way.\n\nAt times you will have to make some important decisions, which is always fun to see in a game.  Things that happen in this game are supposed to change the world of Dragon Age 2, though from what I have heard Dragon Age 2 was a big dissapointment.  Still, this is worth playing.

Well first of all this is the third time I've owned the game, first on the Xbox 360, then again on the PS3, and finally on the PC.  Now this game is dated, it came out in 2009, and you can really see it when you play it.  Even cranking the graphics up to max on your pc won't do much to improve the apperance of the game.  However there are quite a few mods out there that tweak the appearance of the game, making it signficantly more pleasant, however I have not seen any total overhaul mod out there.  Do note that there is no Steam workshop for this game, but Nexus does include the Nexus Mod Manager, and has a very large selection of mods available for this game, so definitely check them out once you buy, and install this beast.\n\nNow for the meat of things, Dragon Age Origins is the first game in the trilogy, and takes place in Ferelden, the fictional nation inspired largely by medieval England, as the on set of the Fifth Blight encroaches the land.  I do not want to spoil anything, so I'll avoid talking any more about the story, but I feel that at this point in time almost everyone has played this game or at least wikia'd the plot.  This game features the point and click style combat, as in I left click over my oponet and he begins to swing his sword, then I can press one of my hotkeyes for him to use a skill.  Do not come in expecting this to be like DA II or DAI, where you'll be spamming the attack button like a game of Dynasty Warriors.  Fortunately you have regenerating health outside of combat, and mages have a healing branch, something that Bioware took out of DAI, which drove me insane, especially on Hard and Nightmare difficulties.  In this game you'll often find yourself pausing combat so you can survey the battlefield, formulate  a plan, and then issue orders, then unpause to watch your four man/woman team move out.\n\nNow I would definitely recommend playing this game on hard at least, to get a real challenge out of things, it definitely makes the game more enjoyable, and I practically live in pause mode/tactical mode.  The mechanics here are amazing, as you travel from area to area, you have a slight ability to explore each of these areas.  Now this is not a free roaming game, well not in the traditional sense at least.  You can control to which 'area' you want to go to, and within each area there is a small degree of exploration involved, but to me that was never important, seeing as how I was so engrossed by the story.  There's plenty of NPC's to talk to, a fair amount of side quests to do, and so much ♥♥♥♥ to pick up it isn't even remotely funny.\n\nThe Ultimate Edition also comes with all the DLC you could ever want, and the game has for that matter.  So you definitely get your money's worth, especially with the story expansion Awakening installed that (can) continue your journey after the completition of Origins.  Not to mention you have all of the smaller story/mission DLC's to play, that will take up a few hours of your time, answer some of your questions or give you some closure in some of them, as well as net you new items for your main game.  Oh yeah I forgot about the prologue story for Leliana, entitled Leliana's Song, which takes place before Origins, lets you play as Leliana, and also gets you some cool items to use in Origins (especially for Leliana!).\n\nThis game is amazing, it has so much content, gameplay is fantastic, the story will keep you hooked and playing until the sun comes back up, and you'll know why this game is the best of the trilogy.  Plus you'll establish such unhealthy connections with some of the characters you might end up getting a body pillo...uh you'll just try to learn everything about them.  Also the game gets better with mods, they're like swear words and spices, it makes things better.  Plus it'll help clean up the appearance of the game a little bit.  Personally I love this game, it's in my top 5 games of all times, and it's better then those other two, and it has a better ending than Mass Effect 3.  This game is a 10/10, you wont find a better game with as much content for this price with access to thousands of mods that make it even better.  Plus it has a story better then the entire Elder Scrolls universe.\n\nEven Commander Shepard would tell you that this is his favorite game on all of Steam, I mean at least believe him, he is the first human SPECTRE, savior of the galaxy, human icon, and an all around great guy.","April 24, 2015","true","20.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Even so many years later, I think this is easily one of the best games around.  The dialogue between companions and with the Player is amazing and I have found myself laughing uncontrollably countless times due to unexpected reactions in dialogue.

Awakening is an expansion of Origins.\n\nIt's a single player rpg, and it deals with a few concepts that really interest me. Namely limited xp. By limited, I mean that once you kill bad guys in an area, they're not going to respawn. Once they're dead, they're dead. So the game encourages you to go to every side quest to get xp and other sundry, because there is NO grinding to be done.\n\nIf there is no grinding and if side quests are a big way to making xp, then it's on the developers to ensure that the quests are worth your time. Especially since there are a lot of side quests.\n\nThey do this phenomenally. Every side quest leads into something. You're not just completing a bunch of filler. You play a pivotal role in the development of others, or it's something funny, or it's kind of heartbreaking.\n\nThere are achievements that don't mean anything, of course, but they're not a massive challenge to get, and you don't have to feel like it takes too long to get them. Or that you need to reset your game to get one.\n\nEvery origin story feels unique, crafted for your race and your gender. Which means there's a lot of changed dialogue, so you don't feel like you're playing the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again. This is especially important for the romance options. Two of them are bisexuals (they exist!), while two are straight.\n\nWhile the game exists on Xbox and PS3, I play it on the PC. Which means it's open to modding, which is wonderfully simple. There's also a good deal of mods to choose from.\n\nThe graphics are pretty damn excellent for 2009 for Origins, and they get better in Awakenings.\n\nPlot: You get to go out and recruit people to help slaughter Darkspawn. Think demons and all that. Which means you get to learn about their culture and make decisions that will influence and mold them. You can even have yourself a genocide if you're particularly evil.\n\nSee, that's the beauty of the game. You can be good, evil, or neutral, or both. And your decisions actually do effect events. Not only in your original game, but you can also import your character to Awakenings and to DA: II. If you do that, all the choices you made in the previous game will affect the other two.\n\n\nCons: Not really much of a con. One event in the Deep Roads can be a little triggering, but this part of the game is meant to be disturbing.\n\nOn the character creation scene, you see that hey, men and women are equal. Like a woman can hold a big ♥♥♥ sword same as a man. It's a common thing in these sorts of games.\n\nBut it also doesn't hold true. In WoW, males and females are treated equally. You get treated the same regardless of gender by all NPCs. Short of someone calling you pretty if you're a female, and that's just one guy.\n\nBut in Dragon Age, yeah, there's a lot of misconceptions. It's medieval, it's fantasy, it's girls should be in the home sort of thing. People are more inclined to see males as rulers, etc.\n\nYou get introduced to something triggering in two of the origin scenes. The noble dwarf, when playing a female, you get told that your enemy's friends will do things to you. And in the city elf origin, your cousin ends up gangbanged when you can't do anything to stop it.\n\nOn the other hand, that's what this game does well. It makes you feel things. Either sadness, horror, or relief. We feel for the NPCs. It's so easy to care for your companions. To want them to cheer up. To want them to like YOU.\n\nOr if you're playing evil, it's fun to also kill them.","March 16, 2014","true","518.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some people may find the graphics of this first game a little outdated (though I believe there are online patches available if you're really that bothered), but other than that I would argue it's an essentially flawless experience. As long as you don't overly dislike fairly closed-world games or the occasional use of strategy in battle, there's not much else to complain about. Even if you do dislike those things, though, I'd still encourage you to give the game a chance and maybe watch some playthroughs on YouTube, just because the DA franchise gaming experience is largely unique compared to all the other games I've personally played.\nI think the greatest appeal of this game is the construction of the narrative. The story is deeply engrossing and involved, with each one of your actions and decisions both in gameplay and dialogue actually changing something about the world and plot. The origins (hA) you pick for your character also change not only other character's treatment of you and the skills you have available, but even the sympathies you yourself begin to hold in relation to the complex world and politics of Thedas. And, of course your role is to save that entire world, so the decisions you make send shockwaves of consequence throughout the entire game but, hey, no big deal.\nThe UE version of this game is an excellent price for not only the long core game itself but also all the available DLCs that are included in this pack. That said, I'd still wait for a sale on the game, just because it's on sale fairly often. If you enjoy RPGs, you should be pretty damn delighted with the rich and complex experience DA:O game offers, and are bound to return to its world for later installments as well.","June 2, 2015","true","91.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game has a multiple companions that can either love or hate you based on your decisions. Also many of your decisions impact the world in some way or another. The overarching story is seen as generic by some and in someways it is, but it is still a very good story. On the combat side of things this game has party based combat in the style of Baldur's gate where you compose a party consisting of you and 3 companions of your choice.  I would recommend getting the ultimate edition over the regular edition because the awakening expansion is very enjoyable. The other dlcs also add to the game and are fun aswell.  You will get many hours of enjoyment out of this game, not only is one playthrough long but there is a lot of replayability due to how many class combinations and decisions you can make. So overall I think this game is well worth the 30 dollar price tag but it is a good decision to wait for a sale as it usually drops to around 7 dollars which is an amazing price for how great this game is. I would give it a 9/10.","November 15, 2014","true","188.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is very immersive and I really felt (through the choices you make throughout the game) that this was MY story to live out. The voice acting and personalities of your companions are wonderful, and I can really see the replay value this game holds. Although I might not replay it for a while.\n\nThe graphics are a bit dated, but can certainly be overlooked. This was not a negative for me, I thought the game aged quite well.\n\nThe gameplay can become repetative, especially if you're on an easier difficulty. If you choose to increase the diffuculty the game gets much more strategic and much less forgiving!\nIt has a very classic dungeons and dragons feel with the combat, although it is not a turn based game. You can pause at any time to select abilites from any companion, or take direct control.\n\nThis is a Bioware game, so if you are not prepared for A LOT of dialog and reading, I might venture to say this is not the game for you. With that said, I enjoyed reading every bit of it. Even the little notes you find in caves or chests as you search rooms. Sometimes pages or notes found become combined to create a story (or quest) once all have been collected. I really enjoyed searching for them.\n\nThe only real pet peeve I had with this game is the lack of a storage container! Unless you buy the DLC there is no where to store your treasures. Which makes inventory management a great hassle!! Especially when I love collecting armor sets and weapons.\n\nI did encounter a few bugs, nothing game breaking.\n\nBuy this game, and save often. If not, just to see possible outcomes you hadn't choosen.","August 13, 2015","true","72.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I like the kind of games where you actually have an impact on the world, and this game does exactly that. Also the game adapts to what kind of character you are, meaning that you'll have some different dialog options depending on your race and gender. Six possible stories to introduce your character. It also not too linear, you can choose in which order you want to complete certain section of the game.\n\nThe mechanics are pretty simple yet you can still developp in-depth strategies. Combat is auto-attack, meaning you click on an enemy and you will keep attacking it automatically until it dies, using your abilities now and there. Not the most dynamic combat system but it worked just fine for me.The story managed to keep me interested the whole playthrought. The companions are great, thought you may feel more connections with some than others. The voice-acting is spot-on and the game offers a good challenge even on normal difficulty.\n\nAs for the DLC that come with the Ultimate edition, they have to be juged individually. Awakening is so far interesting, fun and adds to the story which is nice. Witch hunt is fun for what it adds to the story but kinda lacks challenge. Stone Prisonner adds a kickass new companion. Return to Ostagar was ok; gave good loot. Haven't tried Darkspawn Chronicles yet. Leliana's Song had an ok story but forgettable characters. Warden's Keep give a great opportunity to obtain unique loot and abilities, and gives you some sort of command base where you can store items that take too much place in your inventory. This one has a good value. And last and least, Golems of Amgarrak. I'm just going to say don't bother. It warns you that it's hard but there is a difference between hard and strait up unfair. It's also not story relevant and unrewarding.\n\nAs a whole this game is worth every penny i paid for it. If you like RPG with a deep lore, a good adaptable story, unique companions and awesome combat, pick this one up and give it a try.\n\n","July 18, 2015","true","287.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story keeps a nice pace that doesn't leave you tired (except Orzammar; that started getting a little old), and has an ending that gives you some real choices that change the outcome dramatically.  The DLC for this game (comes with Ultimate, no need to purchase) is equally as well done and equally as engaging, with some nice rewards.\n\nCombat may be my biggest gripe in this game, but there are enough abilities to keep it feeling fresh for a while.  Zooming all the way out to make it a top-down strategy RPG helped the experience dramatically, but by the end of the game, I'd felt it started to get a little long in the tooth.  The animations are somewhat lacking, however, which can sometimes make combat boring to watch.  Managing healing and stamina/mana expenditure usually will keep you pretty engaged, however.\n\nAll in all, I think Dragon Age is a great example of Bioware's quality and commitment to their product during their highest point.  I hope that their games in the future will return to this level of fidelity and aesthetic, and continue to engage the player on multiple levels.","July 8, 2013","true","52.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I put over 100 hours into the gme when I had it for xbox.\n\nNow a days I'm a PC gamer and when I saw Origins on sale for only $7 with ALL the DLC, I just had to get it. I have to say the PC version is a step up from the console version. Not only does it look and control better, but there are a ton of awesome mods you can install to improve the game or just add more content. The conversation system is great and really engaging. The story is pretty interesting and theres a ton of lore around it. And the battle system is a good mix between real time action and micromanagement. You can choose to play tactically by pausing the action and planning your attack or you can just run in hacking and slashing.\n\nI could go on for days about how great this game is but honestly If you like RPG games with a lot of loot, a challenge and a great story then you'll love Origins.","December 3, 2013","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snoremonster/recommended/47810/","snoremonster","SnoreMonster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snoremonster/","199 products in account","In my humble opinion DA:O is the finest single player RPG ever made, by a mile. Some avid RPG gamers would point to Planescape:Torment or Baldur's Gate II as holding this accolade, and they would be right to, but DA:O is a modern game, and that gives it a technological edge (perhaps unfairly).\nThe story is captivating right from the outset. Racism, treachery, and evil is prevalent amongst the Dwarves, Elves and Humans - no-one can be trusted. The tragedy of war and death is vivid, as in the initial scenes where Darkspawn attack a village and an innocent woman is shown running and cut down by their blades. NPC heroes come and go - and Bioware aren't afraid of occasionally killing one of them off in the cruelest way (Walking Dead style).\n\nThe interface is a joy to use - music and effects compliment the story and settings beautifully.\n\nThe battles are great fun! If you are hardcore like I try to be you can turn off all the battle tactics and manually queue up your individual party orders, taking time to pause at least every 0.5 seconds to constantly ascertain your progress. Because of this, some battles, especially the early Revenants, take bloody ages! But it's all so action-packed and spectacularly drawn you don't really notice the minutes ticking away.\n\nMy advice to newcomers to the genre, take your time in the first few areas. Learn the basics, make choices based on your gut, and just take in the story. You will be rewarded with an experience that will last weeks and months to come.\n\nI played about 150 hours of this when it first came out, and last week I snapped up a copy of the Ultimate Edition. What a bargain! All of the DLCs and patches in one place, so it gives me a chance to expand my adventures.\n\nOne word of caution - I run Windows 8 (no service pack) and have a fairly standard setup. It took me about 2 hours to get this game running because of the Origin Client (What is EA Games doing to PC Gaming - please stop it). My advice is check the Steam forums and Google to find your particular workaround, but I would recommend:\n1. Download, install and run the game from Steam just as far as the menu.\n2. Exit, uninstall Origin client\n3. Download latest Origin client.\n4. Activate game through Origin using your Steam CD-keys\n5. Log into Origin and then run DA:O directly from Origin client\n6. Log into EA games from the main DA:O menu using your Origin credentials.\n\nAfter this I don't need to run the Origin client when running the game.\n\n","December 12, 2013","true","77.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I loved playing this game, Bioware managed to do a pretty good job with Dragon Age, even more than Mass Effect in my honest opinion. The story explains very well what is happening in the game world without anything sounding "awkward". The story is one of the best I've experienced lately but it kinda feels they are doing the same they did with Mass Effect, a special organization (Specters/Grey Wardens) fighting to save the day from evil (Reapers/DarkSpawn). But in the end, I enjoyed it very much. The combat handles pretty well and it feels solid, at first I didn't really liked it but after a while I got used to it and now, I adore it. The skill tree and the ammount of options you have that will affect how the game unfolds are surprisingly very good. I wouldn't say the looting system is the best, it's certainly mediocre. With tons of crafting along with runecrafting that there's in the game and the small but good amount of content that Awakening brings into the base game I'd say that this were around 99 hours very well spent and I recommend this RPG to anyone that loves a good story, a good fantasy world and a good experience.","June 6, 2013","true","99.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story keeps a nice pace that doesn't leave you tired (except Orzammar; that started getting a little old), and has an ending that gives you some real choices that change the outcome dramatically.  The DLC for this game (comes with Ultimate, no need to purchase) is equally as well done and equally as engaging, with some nice rewards.\n\nCombat may be my biggest gripe in this game, but there are enough abilities to keep it feeling fresh for a while.  Zooming all the way out to make it a top-down strategy RPG helped the experience dramatically, but by the end of the game, I'd felt it started to get a little long in the tooth.  The animations are somewhat lacking, however, which can sometimes make combat boring to watch.  Managing healing and stamina/mana expenditure usually will keep you pretty engaged, however.\n\nAll in all, I think Dragon Age is a great example of Bioware's quality and commitment to their product during their highest point.  I hope that their games in the future will return to this level of fidelity and aesthetic, and continue to engage the player on multiple levels.","July 8, 2013","true","52.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Also in my opinion, the best out of the series as of writing this. (Dragon age 3 is not yet out)\n\nDragon Age is a RPG with a DND feel to it. It's got loads of Weapons and Armour to provide great flexability while also providing a good amount of spells and specializations.\n\nIt's got detailed companions who act and re-act to the choices you make. They don't just feel like mindless drones following your about because Bioware knows how to make a great character. Just look at the Mass Effect seires. :)\n\nThe story isn't exactly new to Bioware, but the details are. It fits in perfectly within the fantasy world they've created. Similar to Mass Effect, you will have a lot of choices to make, adding replayability.\n\nDragon Age and Dragon Age Awakening are well supported by the modding community.\n\nThe game provides great graphical appeal and stability, the DLC are nice for a short respite and the Awekening expansion pack is a proper expansion. Providing a new story, and even allowing your character to cross over into the expansion, complete with your entire inventory.\n\nThe only negative is that there appears to be a slow memory leak which is most notable lower-end machines. It's not crippling like other games which have a memory leak and is easily setback by re-starting the game every few hours, like when you go get a cup of coffee, or food.\n\nI highly recommend Dragon Age if you are a fan of the work the Bioware does, or if you love RPG's. This is definetly one of those games you will remember for quite a long time.","January 1, 2014","true","97.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Awakening is an expansion of Origins.\n\nIt's a single player rpg, and it deals with a few concepts that really interest me. Namely limited xp. By limited, I mean that once you kill bad guys in an area, they're not going to respawn. Once they're dead, they're dead. So the game encourages you to go to every side quest to get xp and other sundry, because there is NO grinding to be done.\n\nIf there is no grinding and if side quests are a big way to making xp, then it's on the developers to ensure that the quests are worth your time. Especially since there are a lot of side quests.\n\nThey do this phenomenally. Every side quest leads into something. You're not just completing a bunch of filler. You play a pivotal role in the development of others, or it's something funny, or it's kind of heartbreaking.\n\nThere are achievements that don't mean anything, of course, but they're not a massive challenge to get, and you don't have to feel like it takes too long to get them. Or that you need to reset your game to get one.\n\nEvery origin story feels unique, crafted for your race and your gender. Which means there's a lot of changed dialogue, so you don't feel like you're playing the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again. This is especially important for the romance options. Two of them are bisexuals (they exist!), while two are straight.\n\nWhile the game exists on Xbox and PS3, I play it on the PC. Which means it's open to modding, which is wonderfully simple. There's also a good deal of mods to choose from.\n\nThe graphics are pretty damn excellent for 2009 for Origins, and they get better in Awakenings.\n\nPlot: You get to go out and recruit people to help slaughter Darkspawn. Think demons and all that. Which means you get to learn about their culture and make decisions that will influence and mold them. You can even have yourself a genocide if you're particularly evil.\n\nSee, that's the beauty of the game. You can be good, evil, or neutral, or both. And your decisions actually do effect events. Not only in your original game, but you can also import your character to Awakenings and to DA: II. If you do that, all the choices you made in the previous game will affect the other two.\n\n\nCons: Not really much of a con. One event in the Deep Roads can be a little triggering, but this part of the game is meant to be disturbing.\n\nOn the character creation scene, you see that hey, men and women are equal. Like a woman can hold a big ♥♥♥ sword same as a man. It's a common thing in these sorts of games.\n\nBut it also doesn't hold true. In WoW, males and females are treated equally. You get treated the same regardless of gender by all NPCs. Short of someone calling you pretty if you're a female, and that's just one guy.\n\nBut in Dragon Age, yeah, there's a lot of misconceptions. It's medieval, it's fantasy, it's girls should be in the home sort of thing. People are more inclined to see males as rulers, etc.\n\nYou get introduced to something triggering in two of the origin scenes. The noble dwarf, when playing a female, you get told that your enemy's friends will do things to you. And in the city elf origin, your cousin ends up gangbanged when you can't do anything to stop it.\n\nOn the other hand, that's what this game does well. It makes you feel things. Either sadness, horror, or relief. We feel for the NPCs. It's so easy to care for your companions. To want them to cheer up. To want them to like YOU.\n\nOr if you're playing evil, it's fun to also kill them.","March 16, 2014","true","518.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dragon Age will have your heart and make you care for the world and everything within. The game truly makes you believe all of your decions matter and you're making a big difference. Before you even begin the game you will be prompted to pick and choose your race (Human, Dwarf or Elf) with each one having their own unique starting adventure. The game also does a nice job of giving you special dialouge options depending on your race. With so many possible paths you can take in the game, the replayability is through the roof. In my opinion, where Bioware absolutely slam dunked, Morrigan! The romance options in this game was the icing on the cake for me. Never have i ever seen it done more masterfully.

Graphically, the game isn't really much to look at compared to what one might be used to in this day and age of graphics and content; it's an older game, so I should hope prospective buyers can easily overlook this. Secondly, the game does have a tendency to crash (at least on my computer) if too much is going on at one time, but with the ever frequent autosaves and a hopefully attentive-in-saving player, this shouldn't prove too much of an issue. Finally, there is quite a difficulty curve, even on normal difficulty settings. Do not expect a quick walk through the part to overpowered status like in a round of Skyrim; if you don't learn to utilize strategy and your companions, you aren't going to get very far. Luckily, if you are feeling a bit overwhelmed, difficulty can be changed at any time from the in-game options menu, though I would suggest struggling through the campaign on at least normal difficulty for satisfying payoff.\n\nFor the most part, that's really all the issues I can find at this particular moment. There may be more, I just can't think of them! So, let's get to the good stuff. One might expect Dragon Age: Origins to be "like Mass Effect but in the Middle Ages" because of the pedigree associated with it. There are certainly some aspects of Dragon Age: Origins that one may find similar to its developer's previous titles, but all and all, it's unique from both its predecessors and other big-name RPGs.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Origins blends real-time action and careful strategy with the simple press of the space bar, which pauses the game and allows the player to issue commands to every individual in the four-man party. I may also mention here the you, as the player, will find yourself filled to the brim with companions in your camp, but you can only take a total of three others (in addition to your own character) into battle with you. Honestly, it is a bit disappointing that you've got ten companions (plus the additional companions one will find in the episodic DLCs) ready to fight for you, but only three will actually go with you to fight. Anyways, I digress and continue with the gameplay. For the most part, it does have some open-world elements to make it feel closer to a sandbox than it actually is, connecting cities and environments you can explore together on a World Map or City Map, depending on the particular location. Despite the environments being fairly linear in comparison to other games and there being no optional areas in the vanilla game, there are still plenty of nooks and crannies to explore in every city, map or extremely lengthy dungeon. And I say this because some of the dungeons, both due to difficulty and overall length, feel like they take a long time to complete. I do not say this as a negative, personally, because I like the length added to the game, but for some, it may be a bit grueling.\n\nFrom the beginning, character creation isn't as in-depth as other RPG titles. Honestly, that doesn't matter that greatly to me, but hey, it might to you. You can choose from three starting races--human, elf or dwarf--which each have their own racial bonuses (except dwarves can't become mages), and from there, you may choose one of three classes --warrior, rogue or mage--with each class having four specializations like "assassin" for rogues or "shapeshifter" for mages. And yes, you could be a warrior or rogue, but overall, it's just as wise to be a mage and spam AOE damage spells while ordering your allies clear of the AOE (or not, if you are devious), because it will essentially decimate any non-boss group of enemies you encounter. And even some bosses. Finally, each character gets to undergo one of six origin stories, which all feature characters later introduced in the plot and can affect the plot iself later. They all eventually lead to the same place, but regardless, it's a nice touch to the game's opening.\n\nStory's not much to write home about on its own. There is a demon. It is leading an army of other demons. Maybe you should kill it. That's your traditional RPG fare. However, where Origins really shines is in its characters and lore. Firstly, there is an entire codex devoted to lore, information and bestiaries that gets progressively filled as you go through the game, providing an incredibly lengthy amount of reading content for any lore-lover. Origins is a very rich world in that respect. However, my favorite part of Origins is the interactions between characters and the personalities of the involved parties. The aforementioned ten companions you acquire throughout the game are all unique even in their skillsets, despite there being only three starting classes, and none of them feels like a carbon copy of the other. In fact, most don't even feel like they belong to a stereotypical character archetype, as one would normally find in an RPG. They feel fully fleshed out and their interactions between one another and your character feel like real people talking in the real world. Plus, the voice acting is quite high quality for most of them, so they are very expressive to compensate for the weaker facial animations of this era of gaming. Additionally, the villains one encounters in the game are motivated not by a desire to do evil, but by a want to protect others from the coming Blight and to prepare themselves for such a difficult time. I appreciate seeing characters who do evil because they see it as good and rational.\n\nSo all in all? Origins is a quality game. Ultimate Edition comes packed with a huge amount of DLC for an incredible price (though with the time that has passed, I would hope that price would be incredible), complete with Awakening, which is a sizeable campaign (though certainly not Shivering Isles sizeable) with an interesting plot for the lore Origins established. It also comes with several short, episodic campaigns that explore the Origins world from different perspectives, characters and even timelimes. Would I recommend it? Yes, as I have hopefully established earlier. We can only hope the the upcoming Inquisition will live up to Origins' high-standard, as Dragon Age II failed quite miserably before it.","June 15, 2014","true","46.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This makes gives the combat alot of strategy, and makes it alot of fun.\nThe leveling up system is pretty standart, you get to assing points into Strenght, Endurance, Willpower and so on, pretty standart from other RPG's.\n\nThrough out the game you will meet different companions, and you get to make your own group as you see fit. This brings up the strategy again, you can make your group as you see fit, you can go all berzerk and go with 4 damage dealers, or you can even it all out, and have a tank, healer and 2 damage dealers, kinda like you own little WoW dungeon group.\nOne neat feature is you get to have actual conversations with them, and they have different personalitys, and you can earn affection points with each and every one of them. At some point's, your companions will even backstap you, if they don't like you enough.\n\nThe story in the game is great, you are a Grey Warden, the defenders of the Realm against the Dark Spawn. A race made up of monsters, demons and all that evil ♥♥♥♥, who is led by the Arch Demon ( A giant ♥♥♥ dragon ! ), you have to help the realm by gathering an army from different factions through the world, to fight the Dark Spawn horde, els all will be lost.\nIm not going to say much more on the story, but it is one of the best features of this game. The very best being YOU GET TO DECIDE HOW ITS ALL GOING TO PLAY OUT, your choices matter in the game, and will have consequenses later on.\n\nOver all DA:O is a great time, there is so much to do, and you get hundres of hours worth of gameplay. The main game is fantastic, and I'd surgest only getting the DLC if you really like the game, but even the DLC is worth it. They give you a good 3-5 hours worth of content, maybe abit more. Overall the DLC is cool, buy them if you like the game, they are like springels on a already awesome Sunday Ice Cream.\n\nNow the expansion on the other hand, is not really worth it. The story is pretty boring, it ends just as it gets interesting, and it dosnt really feel as epic, as the standart game does. The Story starts a few months after completing the main games story, you are now the Grey Warden commander, and you have to remake the Grey Wardens, by getting new people to become Grey Wardens, as said it sounds pretty cool, but in the end it is a very boring story and kind of lazy written. It's just not as good as the main story.\nThe Expansion got some cool features, like cool looking armors, a new level cap, and some other nice things.\nSure it's some hours worth of gameplay, but overall id say it's not really worth it. It feels tagged on and I would only recomend it, if you can get your hands on the Dragon Age : Origins - Ultimate Edition.\n\nI enjoyed the hell out of DA:O - Ultimate Edition, and I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes RPG's.","September 22, 2014","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a diverse cast of characters, each with their own unique look and personality. As the main character, you get to pick your race (human, dwarf, or elf), completely customize your appearence and skill set, and choose between several origin stories (hence the name of the game) for your character. Based on what you choose, NPC's have different reactions towards you. You can also recruit many companions throughout your travels, each packaged with their own backstory and personal quests. The voice acting in the game is pretty amazing. Each companion and major plot line character has a voice that is unique to them and easily recognizable.\n\nGameplay is great as well. While on easier difficulties, you can take whoever you want with you, click on an enemy, and easily win, it is far more complex on higher difficulties. The game uses a tactics system that makes your companions use their abilities to react to certain conditions. On a high difficulty, it is necessary to balance out your companions abilities and tactics to ensure that you will be ready for even the strongest of enemies. If you don't have good balance or don't plan your battles, you will likely be easily destroyed.\n\nAs far as graphics go, I will admit that this game isn't the best looking (but hey, it's five years old now, so it's pretty easy to overlook, and the other aspects of the game more than make up for it). However, Bioware has made this game easily moddable so there are many mods out there that can completely transform this game. I don't even know how many I have installed, but it's a lot!\n\nOverall, this game is just a fantastic RPG with decent graphics, great story, unique characters, amazing voice acting, complex gameplay, and an amazing modding community.

And when it did finish I was left satisfied yet wanting more. A truly immersive experience, I found myself talking to my companions, and laughing at their bickering. It features a great storyline with a different outcome depending on your choices. There is a bit of a morale system in that certain companions will like or dislike your actions and you will gain or lose reputation with them. Some companions have different morals than others so you can choose to take those who will agree with your choices and thus gain rep with them. However for the most part you'll want to choose your companions based on what classes/spells you need for battles. This game can be brutally hard with battles, but it does have a difficulty option which can be changed at any time.\n\nIf you're a fan of RPG's this is a must-play. It features immersive towns and people, all of which have something to do or say. The world is full and rich, with no "empty" spots.\n\nHowever, the story is somewhat linear, so if you skip something you may not be able to go back later if you go forward in the main quest. Side quests are aplenty as are companions. You may struggle with bag space as you never know what you might need. I got around this by avoiding the crafting specialisations and selling the materials. This left room for all the loot.\n\nAll in all, I'd give this a 9.5/10.

If you liked Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, and Icewind Dale, this is the type of game for you. (minus the D&D rules, but it still follows the basic recipe for a great party-based RPG.)

There are so many tales woven into one wonderful, complete and complex campaign which you can, to a fair extent, influence through your decisions. The combat system is very simple to learn but still can be manipulated to fit your style, and you can make this game as challenging or leisurely as you like it.\n\nNot only can I appraise the obvious, but I can also comfortably say that the attention to detail in this game, right down to the little things like the designs on the armour sets, is set to a very high standard.\n\nIt's abundantly clear how much work was poured into this game. The only flaw I could accentuate would be that the dungeon crawling does get a tad repetitive, but it's necessary, so if you can forsake a hard. gruelling dungeon crawl and you're willing to give up many, many hours of your life, this game comes with my strongest recommendation.","July 8, 2014","true","105.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Where you go next, who succeeds the king, you will you take with you in the next area, which specialties and abilities do you choose, the possibilities are almost endless you will keep creating new characters to try them all. I am currently playing through the game with 3 different characters, and have already beaten it once. Awakening is pretty good, I like the new characters and the story is interesting, and is a good ride as well.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sovana/recommended/47810/","sovana","ウサ子","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sovana/","87 products in account","A personal favorite of mine, Dragon Age: Origins is arguably much, much better than its sequel and many other games released by Bioware.  It's a very, very long RPG game whose story is told mostly in dialogue between your party members and cinematics, with a combat system that is on par with other RPGs for its time, also featuring a pause-combat tactics system to allow more control over your party members and your PC.  Because it is a Bioware game, it also includes the option to romance four of your companions, complete with separate cutscenes, achievements, and quests.  It has very high replay value with many different endings, and offers the player a chance to influence the game by their choices (it could be life or death in some cases). Your party members will also have a say in how you react to certain situations, often with witty remarks or harsh criticism. The only downside to this game that I can see, personally, is the less than stunning graphics quality of the game.  If you want graphic quality, but don't mind missing out on an amazing storyline in exchange for pretty graphics and a slightly better combat system, pick up Dragon Age 2 instead (however, I've only played the console version of DA2, and only beginning to play the PC version of DA:O).  If you want a game that could easily take you weeks to complete a single playthrough, not counting any of the DLC included with the Ultimate Edition, this is a great game for you to pick up.  I highly recommend, also, making a female warden and romancing Alistair.  Trust me, his dialogue makes the trouble worth it.","May 10, 2014","true","59.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sometimes it's a breeze, and sometimes I'm destroyed in seconds. The learning curve for the tactics system and all the available skills can be high, but I don't discount user error.

Alas it does not, and the few dragons you do meet in the game are enemies or shapeshifting mages.\n\nHowever, despite that, I have grown fond of it. It is a very complex game, though you wouldn't know it at first. As it turns out, dialog plays a more important role than you'd think. The combat interface is similar to The Witcher so I was able to pick up on it quickly. There are not so many fetch-quests, which is a relief. The fetch-quests that do exist usually piggyback on other primary quests.\n\nThe main story is the usual "impending doom" scenario that most games have anymore.

Aside from the Elder Scrolls series, I don't know any games that will give you more bang for your buck than Dragon Age (: Origins - Ultimate Edition). If you go through all the DLC and finish most of the sidequests in the game you'll easily spend over 100 hours on a single run, and there were hardly any points in the game where I felt like the plot was starting to drag.\n\nThe gameplay is good overall. I do think the strategy elements were sometimes a bit tedious though. I didn't like pausing battles every 0.5 seconds to give all of my characters new orders and it was also difficult sometimes to get my characters to do exactly what I wanted them to, when I wanted them to. The AI is not as bad as in Mass Effect 1, but I still often had to deal with things like my ranged fighter throwing herself into melee combat rather than keeping distance and my assassin attacking enemies head on rather than trying to backstab. The game does provide you with Tactics slots to tell your characters in advance how to respond to situations in battle, but that takes a lot of time to set up and doesn't always give good results.\n\nAs with most BioWare games (KOTOR, Mass Effect), they've put a lot of effort into developing the main characters and giving them intruiging backstories. However, in Dragon Age I feel like they've even taken it a few steps further. Each individual character gets lots of 'screen time' (if you bother to talk to them) and the romance sidequest has been worked out a lot more than in their previous games. One of the gameplay elements is a 'relationship' system that will make choices you make during the game affect your relationship with your party members. A good relationship will make characters befriend you or fall in love with you (revealing more of the character's backstory), a bad relationship might make the character leave the party permanently. Personally, I really loved this and wish more RPGs had this.\n\nWhat I particularly loved about this game is that the choices that you face during the development of the plot aren't always as straightforward as picking a good or bad option. You will face plenty of dillemmas in which it is not so obvious what the outcome of your choices will be and you'll feel compelled to apply your own moral reasoning to the situation. In the end, this makes it feel more like you're actually playing as yourself (or a realistic human being) and not someone who's putting up a goody-two-shoes / bad-♥♥♥ act.\n\nAnyway, I enjoyed Dragon Age a lot. I think it will please any fan of the RPG genre. It's a very well-made game overall that is more than worth the €7,50 I paid for it during the Sale.","December 24, 2013","true","135.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In this story you are a Grey Warden, a member of a highly-respected order comprised of Ferelden's most elite and capable warriors. It is your sworn duty as a Warden to rise up as a leader amongst the people in order to unite them against a devestating force of evil known as "The Darkspawn." These creatures have dwelled in the deepest, darkest pits of the earth for many centuries and have always been problematic for the dwarves of Orzammar; but it is only during the age of "The Blight" that they are at their full-strength with the "Archdemon" at the helm of their armies. During these times, the darkspawn rise to the surface-world without fear and with only one goal in mind... the complete and utter destruction of humanity. Their numbers are endless, their armies are relentless, and the only thing standing in the way of "The Darkspawn's" total domination of Ferelden is you.\n\nBut why you...? Ahh, now there's where the story gets interesting! My friend, if you have not yet experienced this game first-hand BUY IT NOW! You will not regret it.\n\nPros:\n\n- Intricate Storyline/Plot Twists\n- Great Characters/Voice Acting\n- Choices You Make Have (Sometimes Severe) Consequences\n- Highly Tactical/Entertaining Paused-Based Combat (Similar to KOTOR)\n- A LOT of Lore via Codex Entries\n- Solid Soundtrack/Graphics\n- Tons of Replayability\n- Loads of Content (60+ Hrs)\n- Nightmare Mode Is An Adequate Challenge (Especially Soloing)\n- Mods Mods Mods\n\n\nCons:\n\n- A Few Bugs (Mana Clash-Crash happened to me a few times)\n- Acquiring DLC can be a bit of a pain (Through Bioware Social-Network)\n- Some Specializations Are Slightly Underwhelming (Shapeshifter comes to mind)\n- Not Enough Freedom In Party-Selection (You must have a Rogue to pick locks, etc)\n\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 9.5/10\nVery enjoyable game and (to me) it's already a classic :)","January 24, 2014","true","277.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a diverse cast of characters, each with their own unique look and personality. As the main character, you get to pick your race (human, dwarf, or elf), completely customize your appearence and skill set, and choose between several origin stories (hence the name of the game) for your character. Based on what you choose, NPC's have different reactions towards you. You can also recruit many companions throughout your travels, each packaged with their own backstory and personal quests. The voice acting in the game is pretty amazing. Each companion and major plot line character has a voice that is unique to them and easily recognizable.\n\nGameplay is great as well. While on easier difficulties, you can take whoever you want with you, click on an enemy, and easily win, it is far more complex on higher difficulties. The game uses a tactics system that makes your companions use their abilities to react to certain conditions. On a high difficulty, it is necessary to balance out your companions abilities and tactics to ensure that you will be ready for even the strongest of enemies. If you don't have good balance or don't plan your battles, you will likely be easily destroyed.\n\nAs far as graphics go, I will admit that this game isn't the best looking (but hey, it's five years old now, so it's pretty easy to overlook, and the other aspects of the game more than make up for it). However, Bioware has made this game easily moddable so there are many mods out there that can completely transform this game. I don't even know how many I have installed, but it's a lot!\n\nOverall, this game is just a fantastic RPG with decent graphics, great story, unique characters, amazing voice acting, complex gameplay, and an amazing modding community. If you like RPGs and haven't played this yet,  THEN GET OFF YOUR BUTT AND GET THIS GAME.","August 7, 2014","true","207.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well first of all this is the third time I've owned the game, first on the Xbox 360, then again on the PS3, and finally on the PC.  Now this game is dated, it came out in 2009, and you can really see it when you play it.  Even cranking the graphics up to max on your pc won't do much to improve the apperance of the game.  However there are quite a few mods out there that tweak the appearance of the game, making it signficantly more pleasant, however I have not seen any total overhaul mod out there.  Do note that there is no Steam workshop for this game, but Nexus does include the Nexus Mod Manager, and has a very large selection of mods available for this game, so definitely check them out once you buy, and install this beast.\n\nNow for the meat of things, Dragon Age Origins is the first game in the trilogy, and takes place in Ferelden, the fictional nation inspired largely by medieval England, as the on set of the Fifth Blight encroaches the land.  I do not want to spoil anything, so I'll avoid talking any more about the story, but I feel that at this point in time almost everyone has played this game or at least wikia'd the plot.  This game features the point and click style combat, as in I left click over my oponet and he begins to swing his sword, then I can press one of my hotkeyes for him to use a skill.  Do not come in expecting this to be like DA II or DAI, where you'll be spamming the attack button like a game of Dynasty Warriors.  Fortunately you have regenerating health outside of combat, and mages have a healing branch, something that Bioware took out of DAI, which drove me insane, especially on Hard and Nightmare difficulties.  In this game you'll often find yourself pausing combat so you can survey the battlefield, formulate  a plan, and then issue orders, then unpause to watch your four man/woman team move out.\n\nNow I would definitely recommend playing this game on hard at least, to get a real challenge out of things, it definitely makes the game more enjoyable, and I practically live in pause mode/tactical mode.  The mechanics here are amazing, as you travel from area to area, you have a slight ability to explore each of these areas.  Now this is not a free roaming game, well not in the traditional sense at least.  You can control to which 'area' you want to go to, and within each area there is a small degree of exploration involved, but to me that was never important, seeing as how I was so engrossed by the story.  There's plenty of NPC's to talk to, a fair amount of side quests to do, and so much ♥♥♥♥ to pick up it isn't even remotely funny.\n\nThe Ultimate Edition also comes with all the DLC you could ever want, and the game has for that matter.  So you definitely get your money's worth, especially with the story expansion Awakening installed that (can) continue your journey after the completition of Origins.  Not to mention you have all of the smaller story/mission DLC's to play, that will take up a few hours of your time, answer some of your questions or give you some closure in some of them, as well as net you new items for your main game.  Oh yeah I forgot about the prologue story for Leliana, entitled Leliana's Song, which takes place before Origins, lets you play as Leliana, and also gets you some cool items to use in Origins (especially for Leliana!).\n\nThis game is amazing, it has so much content, gameplay is fantastic, the story will keep you hooked and playing until the sun comes back up, and you'll know why this game is the best of the trilogy.  Plus you'll establish such unhealthy connections with some of the characters you might end up getting a body pillo...uh you'll just try to learn everything about them.  Also the game gets better with mods, they're like swear words and spices, it makes things better.  Plus it'll help clean up the appearance of the game a little bit.  Personally I love this game, it's in my top 5 games of all times, and it's better then those other two, and it has a better ending than Mass Effect 3.  This game is a 10/10, you wont find a better game with as much content for this price with access to thousands of mods that make it even better.  Plus it has a story better then the entire Elder Scrolls universe.\n\nEven Commander Shepard would tell you that this is his favorite game on all of Steam, I mean at least believe him, he is the first human SPECTRE, savior of the galaxy, human icon, and an all around great guy.","April 24, 2015","true","20.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

I loved playing this game, Bioware managed to do a pretty good job with Dragon Age, even more than Mass Effect in my honest opinion. The story explains very well what is happening in the game world without anything sounding "awkward". The story is one of the best I've experienced lately but it kinda feels they are doing the same they did with Mass Effect, a special organization (Specters/Grey Wardens) fighting to save the day from evil (Reapers/DarkSpawn). But in the end, I enjoyed it very much. The combat handles pretty well and it feels solid, at first I didn't really liked it but after a while I got used to it and now, I adore it. The skill tree and the ammount of options you have that will affect how the game unfolds are surprisingly very good. I wouldn't say the looting system is the best, it's certainly mediocre. With tons of crafting along with runecrafting that there's in the game and the small but good amount of content that Awakening brings into the base game I'd say that this were around 99 hours very well spent and I recommend this RPG to anyone that loves a good story, a good fantasy world and a good experience.","June 6, 2013","true","99.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When it first came out, I wasn't interested.

I loved playing this game, Bioware managed to do a pretty good job with Dragon Age, even more than Mass Effect in my honest opinion. The story explains very well what is happening in the game world without anything sounding "awkward". The story is one of the best I've experienced lately but it kinda feels they are doing the same they did with Mass Effect, a special organization (Specters/Grey Wardens) fighting to save the day from evil (Reapers/DarkSpawn). But in the end, I enjoyed it very much. The combat handles pretty well and it feels solid, at first I didn't really liked it but after a while I got used to it and now, I adore it. The skill tree and the ammount of options you have that will affect how the game unfolds are surprisingly very good. I wouldn't say the looting system is the best, it's certainly mediocre. With tons of crafting along with runecrafting that there's in the game and the small but good amount of content that Awakening brings into the base game I'd say that this were around 99 hours very well spent and I recommend this RPG to anyone that loves a good story, a good fantasy world and a good experience.","June 6, 2013","true","99.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miruvors/recommended/47810/","miruvors","they call me hanzo twelve-arrows","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miruvors/","30 products in account","I'm not going to lie; Dragon Age: Origins is addicting. While it may be showing its age graphics-wise, that does not detract anything from the game. You play as the "Warden", a player-created and customized character. The visual options are few in number, but you can easily amend this with mods. You can choose from three races and three classes. Each class has certain specializations that unlock as you level up.\n\nThe main storyline itself is not the most original thing ever, but it's still a damn good one. There are a lot of decisions you have to make along the way that will impact the world AND the later games, if you choose to go on. While there are endings that can be considered happier than others, there are many decisions that are morally ambiguous.\n\nWhat really makes the story, though, are the well-written characters you run into. I think they're one of the main reasons why I love this game so much. You will have party members that clash in personality or get along just fine. As for their relationships with your character, there's an "approval" mechanic for each companion, impacted by the decisions you make and the gifts you give them. Hell, one of them might actually leave the party and try to kill you, if they do not approve of you too much. Four of the possible companions are also romanceable.\n\nThe combat isn't fluid, but that's because it heavily relies on the tactical side. You can pause during battles, control each companion in your party, and tell them to do X if Y. If you're new to the game, easy difficulty is the way to go. Or, if you really want a challenge, there are two harder modes.\n\nDragon Age: Origins is a solid 10/10. I've lost way too many hours of my life on this game.","January 16, 2015","true","154.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A truly awesome storyline backed up by amazing characters who you care about, if not hate, depise or even love. DA:Origins and all that comes with it is really worth it's price tag. Sure the graphics may be slightly outdated, but there are mods for that, along with the in-game preferences. I'd say that this -without having played the ME series- is Biowares finest work. Really awesome, and really worth playing. And an added bonus is of course the fact that it has major replay value, for different endings, romances, relationships or play styles.

However, coming from an RPG hiatus, the combat system needs work. Often I'm grinding mobs without strategy, and the challenge in battles is tempermental. Sometimes it's a breeze, and sometimes I'm destroyed in seconds. The learning curve for the tactics system and all the available skills can be high, but I don't discount user error. Would have loved more of an introduction or a large community focused on min-maxing tactic combinations. In all, great game.

Altogether I've probably spent over 200 hours into this game and if you were to do a full playthrough inculding all the DLC and the explansion you might be looking at around 70 hours of immersive gameplay. Origins in itself is largely about what race/class combo you choose and subsequently throughtout the game you will experience different interactions that promote the game's replay value. So in my opinion it's well worth the money these days.\n\nHowever having never tried the Awakening expansion before, I was surprised by how easy it was even on the hardest difficulty compared to the original game. To me if felt like your hero—if you choose to import from origins—is too well geared at that point and has way too many skills attributes, to the point where often I couldn't even find a place to spend points to maintain my builds later in the game. And add the fact that companions were not so fleshed out in the expansion through things like specific character stories and conversations, you will be surprised at the transition from the base game to the expansion.\n\nNonetheless the base DA:O game is a RPG that I would recommend to all who are interested in a unique pause-combat system in addition to a great fantasy story.","December 26, 2013","true","73.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A solid battle interface, mixing action and strategy perfectly. An amazing soundtrack, enhancing the immersion to the limit. Dozens and dozens of different areas, spanning from cities and castles to ancient forests, dark caves and forgotten ruins, and many more. An incredibly responsive dialogue and choice system, that remembers every single choice you make and throws the consequences  in your face when you least expect them. The companion system, allowing you to recruit and communicate with your many allies, growing bonds of friendship and love that will not be forgotten easily. All this, plus an unbelievable replayability, making every new adventure you decide to embark into a fresh new one, with different classes and races to pick from.\n\nThis is Dragon Age: Origins, one of Bioware's masterpieces.

Altogether I've probably spent over 200 hours into this game and if you were to do a full playthrough inculding all the DLC and the explansion you might be looking at around 70 hours of immersive gameplay. Origins in itself is largely about what race/class combo you choose and subsequently throughtout the game you will experience different interactions that promote the game's replay value. So in my opinion it's well worth the money these days.\n\nHowever having never tried the Awakening expansion before, I was surprised by how easy it was even on the hardest difficulty compared to the original game. To me if felt like your hero—if you choose to import from origins—is too well geared at that point and has way too many skills attributes, to the point where often I couldn't even find a place to spend points to maintain my builds later in the game. And add the fact that companions were not so fleshed out in the expansion through things like specific character stories and conversations, you will be surprised at the transition from the base game to the expansion.\n\nNonetheless the base DA:O game is a RPG that I would recommend to all who are interested in a unique pause-combat system in addition to a great fantasy story.","December 26, 2013","true","73.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was a new game from Bioware in an updated and improved style of the old Neverwinter Nights games. The graphics were a bit clunky for the time that it came out, but it was nice to be able to have abilities that complimented or were fueled off of each other. You could play the game focused on one character or play it like a turn based tactical game. I thought the relationships system was very heavy handed, and largely lame, but you didn’t have to engage in it. Unfortunately Bioware continued experimenting with the system for several more of their games. I enjoyed the game so much that I bought it for several of my friends.\n\nI had more fun playing as a mage than the other classes. I also bought the second game having hopes that it would be a more improved version of DA:O, but they went the wrong way with it making it more of a hack 'n slash action/rpg - so avoid that title. I've beaten this game twice, once vanilla on the 360 and once on the PC - all but the last dlc.","May 28, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is solid and character decisions make a HUGE difference, especially as you can import your save from DA:O into Dragon Age 2, and then into Dragon Age: Inquisition. The gameplay is just as strong, featuring a simple, easy-to-use dialogue system and a robust combat system, replete with AI tactics which can somewhat automate the process of managing 4 characters in a combat environment.\n\nTL;DR - If you like RPG games with meaningful player decisions (e.g., not what Skyrim does with meaningless player decisions) and don't mind an over-the-shoulder/bird's-eye-view approach to a tactically-grounded squad-based combat game, then this is the game for you!","June 21, 2015","true","224.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The world is beautiful, the story is detailed, the characters are colorful and a long game to enjoy every single moment. If you like the Kotor games then you'd like this. The DLC's were fun but as normal they are quite short. You have Leilana's song to learn about her background. Darkspawn invasion allowes you to enjoy being a darkspawn. Shale is a great add on character. Return to Ostagar and Wardens keep are decent small maps. Awakening is very well done with tons of new skills. Witch hunt is decent but short. The Golems of Angnarok is good but the final boss is way to hard in my opinion. All in all, a great series and I had a ton of fun replaying again.

It's a pretty challenging game, and it has a ton of content even without the DLC and expansion.  The character customization I feel could've been a bit better but it's good enough.  Meet lots of interesting characters, and travel around with 3 other characters of your choosing as you meet them along the way.\n\nAt times you will have to make some important decisions, which is always fun to see in a game.

All of the games that I have played that have been made by them (Dragon Age series, Mass Effect series, and KOTOR series) are all up in my top 10 of games. Origins is such a great game that you can lose yourself in. I've put in over 300 hours into it and I'm still not done finding and defeating things. It's worth multiple playthroughs because there are so many outcomes. I would definitely recommend this game 10/10","September 19, 2015","true","375.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mordkill/recommended/47810/","mordkill","Impotent Rage Mordkill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mordkill/","315 products in account","One of the greatest RPG's in terms of lore, story, choices, atmosphere and setting; from the amazing bioware you would expect no less. On par with Mass Effect, DA:O recieved a lot less funding than ME did, and only recieved proper attention from Bioware when the ME triology finished, with DA: Inquisition. While Inquisition is the best RPG in the DA series, Origins is by far the essential bit when it comes to ultimate lore and story, even the DLCs are just intensely mind blowingly epic (the architect). Story for me is one of the best things a game can deliver on, especially when it comes to background stories (lore) and making your own personal choices to decide on the path of that story. Origins was never the ebst gameplay wise, however if you can man-up and appreciate the low-budget gameplay downfalls versus story, lore and everything epic, it's a worth while investment. DA2 was awful, but provided some key bits of lore for DA lore fanboys such as myself and fangirls (good ones on youtube). DA:I might be the best starting point if you can't cope with tragic gameplay of the first 2, however many consider DA2 the entry point of the series, as it's extremely simplisitc (good for casual gamers like my girlfriend).\nThere's many games with good stories and lore, but never has a game made me want to read every snippet that pops up in the text like it has in DA. Skyrim books not for me, DA books and side quests are for me. Bought the books it was so good.","September 5, 2015","true","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I befriended all of the possible companions and I ended up having a relationship with Alistair until the end.\n\nI absolutely loved this game! So many ways how you can develop your character and how your choices massively influence what happens later on, it's brilliant. The fighting is interesting and diverse because you have ranged or melee weapons and then you also have special tricks for mages, rogues or warriors. Especially if you walk around with companions who are a different class, life is really exciting in Ferelden.\n\nThe conversation options are absolutely brilliant. I like the fighting and the quests just fine, but I adore proper character development and relationship building. So many options and opportunities, it was really great fun.\n\nIf you want to play this game on 100%, be careful and maybe read in the Dragon Age Wiki beforehand. This game has a few bugs which may lead to you not being able to finish certain quests at specific points in the game.","January 11","true","154.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
