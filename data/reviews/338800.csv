I used to play this game alot when I was high school back then, along with my father. I played both 7k1 and 7k2, 7k2 offers more features, more civilizations to play, as well as it allows you to play as the Frythans, which you cant do on first series. If I remember the only thing that 7k2 missing from original 7k1 is, there's no naval aspect on the game, no sea at all.\n\nThere's two main species that you can play: Human or Frythans (Monsters). Each have different playstyle. As human you need to watch for mineral resources, village loyalty, and stuffs. Human has 12 civilizations, each of them have their own unique soldiers, and their own deities which you can summon them. But as Frythans, you have to massacre humans for Life Points, you don't need to care about minerals (Unless you are minotauros), no village loyalty they pay tributes to you as long as you set up lair to control the village. There are 7 kinds of Frythans, and again each of them has their own unique units, their own unique structures. You can mix all of these by having a unit that different from yours, surrender to you,, you can have access to theirs tech tree.\n\nAnd yes, this game has high replayability value.\nThe only thing that I hate is, no option for windowed mode.\n\nMy review is short and might have missed some part, if you are interested in this game I suggest you to watch the gameplay video on youtube. Thanks for reading, hope it helps with your purchase.\n\nEDIT: They have released patches to support windowed mode =b","February 5, 2015","true","55.3"," 111 of 120 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","111","120","4","0"

There hasn't been an RTS like this since 1999.  It's been praised as sort of a "Thinking Man's Age of Empires," and that is a fair description.  Instead of mining for resources, you must tax your citizens and trade at markets.  Instead of creating units at barracks, you must draft those same citizens at forts and place them under a capable general to train.  Slipping a few spies into enemy ranks can turn the tide later on - imagine your enemy's face when his most trusted general defects to your side with half his men!  And of course there is always the war against the Frythans - spend too much time fighting your human enemies and you'll both be sorry when a horde of monsters comes charging in...\n\nOr you can just play as the Frythans and build an army of gorrillas.\n\nMy only criticisms are that at the maximum resoltion the game seriously hurts my eyes.  Maybe it's my moniter or my settings.  Either way, it plays just fine for me at lower resolutions.  Sound and visuals are a bit dated and some of the sound effects in particular are very generic.\n\nDespite all that, it's a worthy addition to anyone's library.  It puts the "Strategy" in Real Time Strategy again and makes you think, scheme, plan, and negotiate your way to victory instead of spamming units or racing to the end of some tech-tree.  Check out the other reviews, and you can see that the game definately has some staying power despite its age.","February 5, 2015","true","49.5"," 55 of 58 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","55","58","0","0"

When compared to the major RTS game of the time, the Age Of Empires franchise has better quality graphics and more detailed combat with the sheer number of unit types and combat options at your disposal (however in 7K2, you can control multiple nationalities at once, allowing you to use their unit types for war and opening up more combat possibilities)\n\nBoth franchises are great, but if you want a game that is more about empire building, with amazing diplomacy, strategy, espionage and economy management on a national scale; look no further than 7K2.\n\nFor those interested and want to know how it compares to Age Of Empires, here's what you have in Seven Kingdoms 2:\n\n- DETAILED LOYALTY SYSTEM: Rule your kingdom by fair means or foul. Each person/unit in your kingdom has a loyalty value that's affected by your decisions. For example, if you're an evil ruler, be prepared to control towns that may want to rebel or soldiers who try to defect to another kingdom\n- MEANINGFUL AND INTRICATE DIPLOMACY OPTIONS\n- EXPANSION: SK2 includes towns that are independent of other nations. Expand your kingdom by taking over these towns through gaining their trust or by tyranny.\n- MULTICULTURAL RULE: Control more than one race at a time by taking over independent towns of other nationalities.\n- PLAYABLE MONSTER RACES (called Frythans) that greatly diversify strategy and gameplay\n- DETAILED ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT: mine, manufacture and distribute 3 types of resources, establish trade routes between towns and nations, establish a tax system for your towns\n- EXCELLENT ESPIONAGE SYSTEMS (agitate, assassinate, counter-spy, create an incident between two nations, steal technologies and bribing)\n- RPG ELEMENTS: Each unit (soldier or civilian) has their own name, as well as combat, leadership and loyalty stats that can be improved with more experience\n- HEROS: rule with legends such as Genghis Khan, Hannibal Barca or Alexander The Great\n- A randomly generated campaign storyline that is different each time you play it (although it's somewhat glitchy at times...)\n\nThis HD version is essentially the same game with some higher resolution settings and some patches to gameplay.\n\nI've seen on forums that some people have had problems running the game, thankfully I haven't had any of these issues.\n\nAdd me if you're interested in multiplayer.

I first played it at a friends house, and left thinking it was the best game ever. For a good 11 years, this was my favorite game of all time until I discovered Company of Heroes. My dad and I used to fight over who got to use the good pc just to play this. It taught me to wake up early on my own, up at 4 am = no dad on the pc.

I kind of bought it randomly at that time but without doubt, without any regrets.\nI have played many RTS games over the years but never found anything again wich was as unique as seven kingdoms 2.\n\nI mean one of the coolest things in this game is that your units can lvl up in battle to extremely high lvls and become crazy overpowered.\nThe other kingdoms and kwyzans can do this aswell and delivers very crazy battles.\nYou are the king and start off at lvl 100 while your units start at lvl 20.\nNow, as you participate in many battles with your units they will gain a much higher combat lvl and a better leadership lvl. Your strongest dudes will be the most recognisable ofcourse and you will make generals out of them so they can lead other parts of your growing army.\n\nNever ever was i able to create such a bond with my generals and stronger units.\nThe stronger they become and the more battles they have won for me, the more units they have trained to follow in their footsteps in the quest to conquer or destroy everything.\n\nThe feeling of anger and despair when one of your strongest generals falls to battle is undescribeable!!! xD\nYou will truly hate th enemy for it and you will be comitted to take your revenge.\n\nWithout a doubt this only!! is a truly a unique element in the game and reason enough for me to write this review.\nImean how awesome is it that at one point you can have this unit of (for example) lvl 500+ and hes holding out against groups of enemys your other units would be killed by in seconds.\nUnits you literally create a bond with!!!\nUnits that you will truly remeber for their glorious battles after they die!! xD\n\nEnough about that though :)\nThis also was the fisrt game where i actually enjoid the diplomacy. (mostly when playing humans).\nHumans are also harder to play since the overall monsters are much stronger then the humans.\nThis is why as a human kingdom you will have to play smarter and start trade treatys and alliances with other kingdoms.\nOr perhaps even get some frythans to aid you.\n\nNot that this is something i would recommend since frythans create new units by spending gold and lifepoints.\nLifepoints are harvested when killing living beings. So you can expect that frythans will eventually betray the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out of you and destroy you in seconds if your army is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• :).\n\nAre you up for a chalenge and you like diplomacy? Go play humans and try to beat these frythans.\n\nDon't you give a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about anything or anyone? Go play the frythans and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up everything that moves!!! and if not? BEND THEM TO YOUR WILL!!!\n\nI honnestly wasn't aware of the fact they released an HD version of this game on steam.\nBut ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• am i exited that i can finnaly spend a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• load of hours to this fine ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• specimen of a game.\n\nIf you like bonds with your units, if you like total destruction, if you like taking revenge on backstabbing ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•es that call themselves kings, if you like a chalenge. Then this is the game for you. With all the unique elements i bet you will fall in love with this game if you give it a chance.\n\nAlso if you don't mind the fact that it looks kinda old ofcourse :).\nIt doesn't make it less awesome i tell ya. BUY THIS JEWEL OF A GAME!!!!!!!!\n\nThanks for reading this anyways!!!\nSee ya ;)","December 25, 2015","true","22.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Each unity is kinda unique since all of them have different names plus theres the awesome addition of the hero unities that you can buy out them on your inn or they will seldon  join your army depending on certain factors, and to finish up theres also some artefacts to increment your unitys power.\n-Easy to understand scenario editor for those who love to make maps\n-Easy to understand tutorial and to get into it, the game is easy to learn but hard to master\n- random events can make the game more impredictable(tornados earthquakes, tempests, plagues etc)\n\nCONS:\n-Multiplayer need a 3rd app to get into it(at least for the time being I hope they change it)\n-unities movimentation and some animations are kinda outdated\n-AI is kinda dumb so when you figure out how it thinks the game becomes way easier\n-lack of archivements or trading card for the momment being\n-the maps are pretty shallow(all are plains that you can config to be fartile with green grass or badlands to be a like a wasteland, plus some mountais and misc.s that you cannot cross or interact)\n-some civilizations seens kinda underpowored and others more op\n\nThe dinamic campaing is also okaish its not bad but its random generated some ppl might not like it(you will keep repeating very similar scenarios on  them)\n\nOverall its a great game if you are looking for a great RTS experience even considering its flaws, the game being relatively cheap I highly recommend you to grab it and try it out if you are looking for one of the best RTS, you wont regret it.","December 18, 2015","true","41.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

This game is truly a unique gem and easily forgotten but offers so much even today despite it's somewhat dated looks.\n\nIn Seven Kingdoms you take control of an human civilization on a typical rts styled map, you can pick between 12 civilizations which all look aesthetically different and have various strengths/weaknesses. Furthermore you can pick a Frythan race, which are mythical and gruesome creatures bent on enslaving everyone. Both factions play very different, where human civilizations are more refined and deep, the Frythans are more about conquering.\n\nThe game has some very unique mechanics, basically the player tries to take over towns (either peacefully or with force) to increase your population. Recruiting them as builders or soldiers from a pool. Diplomacy, wafare, research and espionage are of utmost importance and allow you for different playstyles. You can pick between various approaches to conquer your enemies which is certainly a welcome change, it's a lot deeper than your typical rts. It has some major 4x elements so there are a lot of factors that you have to consider. The Frythan faction is more straight forward though with a heavy emphasis on warfare. The campaign is certainly unique and has some Risk elements, don't expect anything amazing but it's still very entertaining. I definitely recommend this game for the multiplayer though, playing with a friend is a blast.\n\nThe things that I could critique is the dated graphics and sound assets, but I personally don't mind it that much. It is servicable and still quite good. Also sometimes it can be a bit confusing if there is a lot of activity going on, there are sometimes a lot of factors to manage but luckily the hd edition allows for a larger overview, making it easier to navigate. Which reminds me that this game can be extremely challenging at first, the AI is actually really competent and can easily wipe you out even if you consider yourself an expert at rts games.\n\nStill I definitely recommend this game for anyone who likes a somewhat unique rts with a nice twist. It offers variety from other games and runs on every pc.\n\nOne last thing I want to mention is that the developer is really present and communicates intensively with the community in order to fix bugs, balance game and make it overall a better game than it used to. That is very recommendable and helped me with some issues that I previously had with the game.","February 9, 2015","true","2.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

I gotta say I love it. I played this back when I was a teen and as young and immature as I was I enjoyed it then. I was more in love with part 1 than part 2. Is this game worth the HD upgrade. So far not many feautures are improved. Hopefully they will add better multiplayer support, steam workshop and biger fonts.\n\nPro:\n-economics is far superior than any other RTS. I always hope other games by now would take their economic model and apply it to other games. Sadly no. I love that you have to build a mine, have a factory to produce goods, then sell it on the market. In order to make more income you have to have diversity in your market either by exploiting more resources your self or trade. Proabably cause Trevor Chan created business simulators like Capitalism which gives him the edge to create  a more realistic economy than tact on markets like AOE.\n- Diplomacy is awesome. Your other nations will constantly try to pursuade you to trade technology, embargo other nations. No other RTS is this advanced in it.\n- Espoinage. They have real spys that can steal infomation from competing nations.\n-Military recruitment. I love how you have to recruit villagers to join the military rather than produce them like a product like in other RTS. They have loyalty meters which means they can turn against you. You also have to promote your soldiers to generals in order to control forts. Forts are needed to bully villagers and recruit peasants in your ranks.\n\nCons\n-clunky pathfining\n-Not much improvement yet for a HD version.\n- Too small fonts for bigger screens\n- soldier movements are pretty clunky, makes actual fighting enemies not very engaging\n\nIf you want an RTS with innovative economy please support this game. Maybe they will make a new one with better graphics, interface and better rock scissor paper strategy. They have a great forumula that will do well if updated to a modern game. This is not a RTS like AOE, C&C, Starcraft/Warcraft. They didnt try to innovate with small unit tactics like Dawn of War2. They ask for grander scale than your average RTS. Proabably Sins of a Solar Empire maybe a better comparison because they try to take 4x TBS elements and place them on a RTS.","February 10, 2015","true","3.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is simply one of the best rts games ever made because it is realitivly simple to learn but VERY hard to master plus there is a wide choice of cultures to play as plus a fair amount of fryhtans to play as. The replayability is almost infinate because of the random generated campaign, the scenarios, and the scenario creator. In conclusion I definatly recommend this game for the price.\n\nNow in all fairness their is one big negative right now and that is the optimization of this version. There is quite a bit of lag everytime you open a menu inside a game and also very rarley just at random times the framerate can drop as low as like 10 frames or just freeze for a second.","February 12, 2015","true","4.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You'll need to look past the outdated graphics, the mechanics and gameplay is what makes this RTS stand out.\n\nThere are some cool unique mechanics that makes me always come back to this game. Firstly, military units have two general stats: combat and leadership. Combat affects the units health and damage. Leadership applies a combat bonus to all troops under that General's command and also increases the rate at which the General can train their troops up in combat. Any military unit can be promoted to a General. When you recruit your military, they start off weak, but through combat and training from general they improve dramatically. Which means, a small group of veterans often can take on large forces of fresh recruits. This makes for some interesting gameplay.\n\nI really enjoy the economic aspect of this game. This game only has two resources, food and money. You own towns which generate food as long as there are farmers. Money is also generated by towns via taxes, or via trading. But whats cool is for money, one needs to manage it well as there are maintainence costs. Rather than the usual gather resources and spend it, you always need to keep in mind do you have enough income coming in to sustain your expansion. So you really need to balance your economic versus your military / spy network expansion. Expand to quickly, and you'll go into debt whereby all your buildings start taking damage from poor maintenance and all your troops and citizens start becoming less loyal.\n\nAnother aspect of the game that is enjoyable is the spy networks you can build. Do not understimate the power of distration during war where you can sneak spies into enemy forts and bribe their generals. Nothing beats having a huge army storm towards your base, only to get the generals to defect to yourself and watch as half of the enemy's army follow their generals and joins you as well.\n\nThere is a lot to the game and it would be impossible to cover it all here. If you love strategy, RTS, and are looking for unique and fresh gameplay then this game is for you.","February 21, 2015","true","14.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This has been a common issue as I've seen a lot of other complaints of this online, however the developers haven't even tried to help. They suggested some random solution that someone had posted on their forum that didn't work for most people, and aside from that one half-baked attempt, there has been no support from them. I emailed them asking for some sort of help or suggestion multiple times eager to play this awesome game but never once got a response, and now of course it is too late for a refund. Don't give them your money, go online and find a hard copy on CD.

Despite all of its good ratings i dont think it ticks all of the boxes:\n\nalthough remastered in HD it still feels very dull and unexiting, and at times quite flimsy.\n\nThe gameplay is quite confusing.\nFirstly, there are what seems like hundreds of tutorials for both races and that gets you quite down.\nSecondly, the way of expanding your teritory isnt very clear.\nFinally, each race of humans has only 3 units and fryhtans only have one, and rucruiting them is quite hard to remember.\n\nto sum it up i played a mission on the easiest difficulty only to be, within 5 minutes, utterly overan by fryhtans.\n\nAfter giving the game a second chance ive discovered its positive side, my game time being small i dont think i should of judged so early. And after playing it again only for a couple of minutes i have discovered why this game is so good:\n\nThe game is unique compared to other RTS' offering a different and exiting way to play.\n\nIt offers two main races with completely different playing styles, theese then split into smaller groups that are unique in their own ways.\n\nOverall its a great game for its age and price, and is a great thing to play when youre completely bored. soooo i take back my earlier 3/10 and replace it with a far better\n\n8/10","February 15, 2015","false","0.8"," 2 of 19 people (11%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","11","2","19","0","6"

I recommend it.\nThis game is fun, espionage, politicks and unlike 1st game, it allows you to play for monsters. :)\n\nGame is not that complicated and has simple mechanics, just manage your kingdom. Trying to balance your budget, managing food so your subjects dont starve to death and diplomacy, so your neibours and monsters will not crush you. It does not seem as much, but it is suprisingly entertaining.\n\nHowever, there are few things, which always bothered me about this game.\n\n1st are gods, flying around with different powers, some completly useless, some extremly powerfull. For example, Carthaginian god can create earthquake, significantly damaging half of your kingdom and there is nothing, you can do or Indian god, just throwing few tornados at your cities. Unlike gods with direct attack, gods with indirect attack, are not considired declaration of war.\n\n2nd thing is late game. When most kingdoms (usualy excluding Egyptians and monsters) run out of population for armies and research siege equipment. At that moment war machinery spaming starts and big battles are replaced with small skirmishes and spitfires burning everything in their path.\n\nSince lately many strategy games are just stupid clones of 20 years old games and lately a lot of strategy games are either 20 hours building games or fast wish to be new e-sport fast ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.\nThis game is nice middle and even with those few problems, you should try it.","May 18","true","29.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The HD graphics are great and they added a new extra-large map mode, which also brings a nice touch to an old formula.\n\nIf you never played SK2 before: SK2HD is basically a strategy game that mixes politics heavily into the flow, bringing forth some really Game of Thrones moments. Some features simplified:\n\n- you have only 2 types of unit per kingdom + your god. Basic units can be created from the get-go and fill forts, in which they train under potent commanders. After x Combat points they unlock a special attack (usually a range attack or a more powerful melee attack)\n- the two resources in the game (food and money) are managed through economy and agriculture. For economy you need to creat markets connected to factories connected to mines. for agriculture,  you need a village  that has as many free people as possible (mines/factories/laboratories require manpower, which is subtracted from the village worker force).\n- diplomacy is the name of the game. you will have to carefully select your friends and allies and join wars with caution. a war will weaken your kingdom and make it vulnerable to new attacks. You will also loose seasoned warriors and, in the worst case scenario, generals.\n- espionage is a potent tool in this game. you can sabotage production, stir an uprising, bribe soldiers/generals to join your side (as spies themselves), capture forts (if your spy is the general) and even hand over the entire kingdom to your side (if, by some miracle, the other king dies and one of your spies is selected as king\n- mercenary units can be bought and make excellent troops, especially when you have to hold an advancing force while your main army reaches the battle (pro-tip: builds LOTS of inns)\n\nIt's an easy game to learn, yet pretty complex, since it requires careful planning and knowing exactly when to jump in the world war (all maps eventually end in world wars). Jumping in to soon might weaken your kingdom and turn you into prey for whoever will end up victorious. Jumping too late, however, might see you facing a kingdom that is spread over the entire map and who's army outnumbers yours 10 to 1.\n\nLike in real politics, wait and see which side begins to dominate the map and join the other one.\n\n\nThere's also monsters in the game. They can't do diplomacy (even if they want to), which makes them far less fun but more of a challenge.","May 5","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
