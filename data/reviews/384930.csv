Yeap, you can. Afterall we are living in a wonderful times in which you can turn every classic into a mess.\nStarting the game\n\nOnce you start the game you are great by 1280x720 resolution(at least on 1920x1080 monitor) with no option to change... hell there arent many options to change in the game. Do you want Music/Sound Effects/Explosions/Shake Screen on or off. Thats about it . Okay.. maybe the gameplay will be worth it.\n\nGameplay\n\nSo you pick a ship(1 of the 3 avaible ships) and go fight alien ships( I saw 4 kinds of regular ships + 4 kinds mothership). So you fly around firing your cannon/s and blow ships, once they blow up another wave comes greated by "robotic" voice. With every wave , enemy count increases to the point where you get killed with 1 shot and need to start all over. There is no end level so not much to fight for unless to kill 5 minutes which could be spent in more productive way in other games.\nEvery now and then you will encounter mothership levels which can be hilarious at times. Either ship not moving or heading to ram you with higher speed than your own ship(I wished I had motherships engines). But there is also progression with mothership waves, the higher the way, the more guns it got!!! Hardcore!!!\nNow lets stop talking about enemies and see what tools you got to fight against them. 3 ships with questionable design.\nShip N.1 got 1 gun but on the design you can clear see 4. But in the game you shoot a single rocket so why are there 4 visually added guns when only 1 is working? For show off? Oh and should add that its the fastest ship you have(4 out of 5 points; prolly motherships are 5 out of 5)\nShip N.2 got .... wait for it .... 2 guns(when you can see 4 on the ship design) but the issue with it is that those are "flak" guns and good for close combat only which is hell of a fun when you can die from 1 shot . Should add that it cause fps drops like mad once you start shooting. Also .. speed 3 out of 5 points\nShip N.3 the biggest, the strongest... the crappiest.  You have 3 guns that you fire in spread so wide than you will rarely hit more than 2 targets at once. And lets not forget speed 2 out of 5!!!\nCommon thing about all ships is the special weapon : Nuke!!! Which charges up as you hit targets and when used it may or may not hit the ships.\nAnd all this glorious battle happens over a single background image.\n\nIs it worth it?\n\nNope, not a chance, even when its damn cheap you better save money from not buying 2-3 crappy games and get a good one.\n\nWhy my playtime is so low?\n\nBecause there is nothing to see else in the game, 5 minutes in you will unlock the 3 ships, play with them to the point where everything is the same and you are done. There are no achievments to earn, cards to idle or story to follow.\n\nOverall\nNo... just no.","July 31, 2015","false","0.3"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","32","40","6","0"

So here is an overal review of the game:\n\nPRO's:\n\nPRICE (Well worth it)\nThe difficulty is well balanced and substantially gets harder after I unlock the second ship.\nLove the explosions and variation of the explosion sounds\nThe background music is enjoyable, but I also love the mute option! haha\nAlways love when games put in the classic screenshake!\nEnjoyed the multiple styles of ships ! I have only played with the first two but the second one is awesome!\n\n\nCON's:\n\nLack of configuration options\nWould love to see a global leaderboard and not just local\n\n\nOVERALL\n\nThe game was a good fun fast paced shooter based in space with a mix of the classic and newer technologies with good explosions and sfx. Would love to see some more configuration options and more ships! Overall a great buy for a only $0.99!\n\nSUGGESTION\n\nBuy if you like small fun shootemups that will keep you distracted for a couple hours for under $1.00 on sale!\n","July 10, 2015","true","0.6"," 23 of 33 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","23","33","0","0"

I saw there were a few negative reviews but since it was only $0.99 on sale I figured I would try it out!\n\nOverall I am pleased with the game and the excitement from blasting alien ships! I have unlocked all three ships and it is much easier to progress through the begnning levels with the third ship since I can get hit 3 times and I shoot 3 bullets in a spreading pattern!\n\nI did have a few bugs that consisted with the settings like another reviewer had. Once they get the settings fixed in terms of working correctly, sometime the music stops and other times it doesn't I would say it would be worth like $2.99!\n\nOverall good game and a great buy if you are looking to have some fun shooting some aliens! what is best is I got it on sale for only $.099!","July 10, 2015","true","0.7"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","16","25","2","1"

Pilot Crusader is another one of those games that a classic formula but doesn't do anything new with it.\n\nPilot Crusader got the inspiration from games like Space Invaders. Every round you destroy every alien ship without getting hit (that means Gameover). Every 3 rounds you have to battle a mothership and that's it basically.\n\nI wouldn't say the game looks terrible graphic-wise, some of the space ships do look nice but there are only a few different enemies to battle, so things get boring pretty quickly. There are also 3 ships you can choose from, which have a different kind of attack. Somehow the second space ship made my game lag whenever I was shooting....\n\nOverall this game could be fun for 5 minutes if it was free but it's not and I consider this one of the worst Space Shooters out there.\n\n","March 3","false","0.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Bug down.\n\nSometimes the Mothership doesn't spawn in, and forces you to loose the streak.\n\nThere is no way to tell how to unlock more ships.\n\nThe AI and Ships in here are simply way too fast and your cannons are weak, and you can get killed with a single hit. Simply not recommended, they have Refunds for a reason.","July 10, 2015","false","0.2"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","15","26","4","3"

Hit box detection is bad and causes lots of deaths. The axis in which the ship rotate around constantly moves, so the ships don't always rotate around the center of the ship. Every third level is a boss fight and it's random as to which boss you fight. There are three bosses and their difficulties vary. When you die once, it's game over. No life bar and no extra lives. It's not fun at all. Overall, this feels like a student project for a programming class.","July 19, 2015","false","0.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","5","8","2","2"

Shots are hard to see due to the explosions (yes, it's set to under and I still can't see what's hitting me).  Fast enemies and slow enemies both fire the same shots.  Unlocking the second ship actually made it harder to play since shooting drops the framrate noticeably (why?!  there's hardly anything onscreen?), and you have to shoot at the enemies point blank and they will fire a bullet you can't even see that kills you.  The first ship rotates around it's lower right corner (I think?) rather than it's center, etc., etc.  Too frustrating to play long enough to unlock the third ship.","August 1, 2015","false","0.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Reminds me alot of Missle Command. Works well, and can become really addicting do to its simplicity.  When you make it to the first boss, be ready to nuke. very stable, and very simple overall. My only gripe is that if your ship is facing the opposite way you are trying to move you hardly move and you end up dying and have to start from the beginning.

Be aware though that it still comes with a couple of flaws in it's current version. If you peek into the forums you'll notice that the devs are trying to get rid of those issues but the game isn't very polished by the time I write this review.\n\nGraphics are somewhere between ok and cool, keeping in mind it's an indie I'd say it totally does its job.\n\nControls, well no Joypad so far, someone should indeed be whipped for that design decision ! SHAME, SHAME,... !\nSeriously, the game kinda feels like a very early version of Beat Hazard, basically that is a very good thing ;)\n\nSession Playtime, is delightfully short thus you could play 1 to 3 levels in about 5 minutes of time, something I do prefer.\n\nIf the devs manage to add joypad support and cope with the bugs you probably won't do anything wrong by spending 2$ on this.\n\nRegards,\nNicoNico","July 29, 2015","true","0.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"
