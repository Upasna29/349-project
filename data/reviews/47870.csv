"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toxic_fuel/recommended/47870/","toxic_fuel","Toxic Fuel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toxic_fuel/","123 products in account","To start off, I can't say that this is my favorite NFS game of all time, but it is certainly up there. I have been a NFS fan for a long time, dating back to the good old PS2 days with Most Wanted and Carbon. So far no other NFS game, in my opinion, has been better than those, but Hot Pursuit is definitely in the top 10 on my list for racing games, and here's why.\n\nPROS:\n\nThe graphics are fantastic. The car models are awesome as always, and the scenery is beautiful. Yes, scenery especially matters to me because I want to be able to go for a nice drive, if that's what I'm in the mood for. It looks great at 200+ MPH too! Now don't expect Metro: Last Light graphics, but it really is a nice looking game.\n\nThere are quite a few cars as well. I can't say for sure how many there are, but it's certainly enough to keep you busy with trying certain races with different cars or just taking them for a spin. Not to mention that for every normal car in the game there is a cop car counterpart, with the addition of a couple! So if driving at 250 MPH on a freeway with sirens on sounds fun to you, please give this a try! But what about how they handle?\n\nI personally enjoy how the cars handle in this. It is NOT a simulator in any way. It is arcade style racing with easy drifting so you can boost into those corners like a boss without losing tons of speed or control. To me it seems like all the cars handle in a very similar fashion, but I actually don't mind it. I don't think this type of racing is for everyone however, but it's not hard at all to get used to. Remember that this game is all about going fast to evade cops or bust racers using special abilities, so you can't be completely focused on realistic driving. But that brings me to another thing I love about this.\n\nIn the game, whether you are a racer or a cop, you have access to EMPs, spike strips, roadblocks, extreme turbo, and more. All these make the game more exciting and tense. If you are a racer, you can drop spike strips on cops OR other racers and use EMPs to pass someone, and if you are a cop, you use all of these to take down racers. I especially enjoyed the cop career more because it is really fun to smash into other cars and send them into a barrel roll or other cool crashes.\n\nNEUTRAL:\n\nThe free roam is one thing I always want in a racing game. Yes, Hot Pursuit does have it, but I feel that it is missing content. Being able to free roam as a racer, you would expect to occasionally run into a police car and get into some sort of epic chase, or vice versa being a cop, but sadly that just isn't the case. There aren't even any collectables! I guess the free roam in Hot Pursuit is pretty much there to test out cars or just go for a nice ride. So yes, it's nice to have, but it lacks content.\n\nThe menus are sub-par. You can very easily tell that it is more suited for consoles. While I strongly recommend using a controller for this game anyways, the least they could have done was provide a more intuitive menu for us PC gamers.\n\nCONS:\n\nWith the exception of changing the color of the car, there is NO customization. I guess I "spoiled" myself with the feature of customizing back when I played on the PS2 because now every NFS game that has come out recently has zero options to customize, and it has been very disappointing. I don't know why they ever took it out.\n\nNow that I think about it, the menu tutorial at the very beginning of the game is really dumb and unskippable. It's like they expect you to know absolutely nothing about how a menu works. It is completely useless and takes a couple minutes. Can't you just let us play the game already?\n\nTL;DR:\n\nNFS: Hot Pursuit is a really fun game with very nice graphics, great selection of cars, and tense racing. While free roam could have been significantly improved, it is always great to be able to go for a joyride in any of the vehicles you have unlocked, including the cop cars. Taking down racers or the police using EMPs, spike strips, roadblocks and more is very satisfying and really adds to the gameplay. There is no customization, with the exception of painting your car different colors, so this is a big let down, but nonetheless a very fun game. As a racing game enthusiast, I have to give this game a 7/10. Very fun!","November 14, 2014","true","21.8"," 206 of 232 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","206","232","2","12"

Hot Pursuit may well be the pinacle of this.\n\nThe races themselves are a lot of fun. The cars have a good sense of speed, the sound is great, the crashes have impact and the game is very pretty all around. The problem is that you won't actually get to experience these things much. The majority of your time will be spent watching unskippable cutscenes, loading times, logging in on your EA account (with no way to save your login details so you don't have to enter them every singe time you start the game) or being harassed by the game to check out its totally cool social hub feature where it pretends to be Facebook. And God help you if the EA servers happen to be down, in which case the game will try connecting to them at the start of the game and the end of every single bloody 2 minute race, taking 10 seconds each time. It really adds up to the point where 50% of your time with Hot Pursuit is spent looking at ♥♥♥♥ you really don't want to see.\n\nWhy can developers not understand that when someone buys a racing game, the chances are they actually want to race? No NFS, I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about your unnecessary Facebook clone "feature", I don't want to try and connect to your instable servers every 2 seconds and I don't regard your variety of spinning wheels in loading screens or unskippable cutscenes with particular affection either. Please make them optional so I can drive some fast cars without jumping through a bajillion hoops for a 3 minute race. Thank you.","December 27, 2014","false","5.6"," 253 of 303 people (83%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","83","253","303","26","10"

At least that's what I expected. Back in the '98 version it was a great fun game of racing vs your opponents, and the police - avoiding insanely high speed crashes and shaving that couple of seconds extra off a track, or getting a little nudge in at just the right moment, to win a race.\n\nFast-Forward many generations of game development and hardware cycles, and we have the reboot.\n\nInitially it looks promising, graphically it's a lot nicer, the tracks are interesting, and they've kept the tradition of high-risk shortcuts to get to the end faster - but this is one of the things that shows up the games truly hideous faults.\n\n1- The enemies are scripted to keep up, not actually racing around the track as they look, but constantly teleporting around the track to be close to you. No matter how good you are, you cannot get more than a few seconds lead, even on a car you just saw crash into a virtually impossible situation, while you are at max boost - he'll be on your tail and overtaking the instant you take a corner less than optimally.\n\n2- Speaking of cornering - it cannot be done without a horrible skid mechanic. You just dont get to keep control of the car. At the time the game was made, drifting was very trendy, and the makers seem to have decided to make it mandatory for every car, every race.\n\n3- The collision detection is horrible for such a high end racing game. Often you pass another vehicle, or other obsticle, knowing you've cut it close, but also knowing you've missed, when suddenly the game decides you've hit, and not just clipped something, but catastrophically flipped your car and ruined your race.\n\n4- Hardware support. After a few months of having this game, my nephew loved playing it for fun, so despite not being able to forgive it's foibles, I kept the game, but after I changed some stuff on my system, it's refused to run ever since. Gets to the loading screen, CTD with no error report.\n\nRIP NFS memories.","July 23, 2014","false","18.3"," 228 of 271 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","228","271","2","10"

This blisteringly fast racer has more in common with developer Criterion Games' own Burnout series than it does with any previous Need for Speed offering, despite lacking a number of features that are commonly associated with Burnout games. This isn't a game in which you're rewarded for crashing spectacularly or for jumping through billboards, but it is a game that encourages you to drive dangerously and to take down your opponents by any means necessary. The option to play both as illegal racers and as the cops that are chasing them brings some much-needed variety to the action, while spike strips, road blocks, and other satisfying countermeasures ensure that Hot Pursuit doesn't feel quite like any racer that you've played before. Regardless of whether your interest in Hot Pursuit stems from a love of Need for Speed, Burnout, or neither, you won't be disappointed.","March 5, 2014","true","127.5"," 120 of 144 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","120","144","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anonanon/recommended/47870/","anonanon","Charlie Cyprus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anonanon/","290 products in account","This 2010 comeback of the Hot Pursuit series, developed by Criterion, is a great example of how not to reboot a game. Thankfully this game turned out to be very fun.\n\nIn short, Criterion turned Need For Speed into a full-on car combat game. For those of you who were wanting a faithful follow up to Blackbox's 2003 Playstation 2 classic Hot Pursuit 2 will be greatly disappointed. If you come from Burnout 3 Takedown or Revenge roots, then this will be a tough call as well since iconic fictitious car brands and super accessible arcade driving physics are out. For those who love car combat or even kart and anti-gravity racers sub-genres may want to look into this game.\n\nDespite the fact that Hot Pursuit 2010 is rooted in reality, the core gameplay is about cops versus racers equipped with weapon loadouts duking it out on mostly point-to-point courses. There are a lot of mind games to be had, from intentionally driving backwards to strategically cancelling enemy EMP blasts.\n\nThe driving physics are heavy and boat-like compared to past Criterion titles, but you can still swing your car left and right easily enough to stay in the realm of arcade driving. Once you engage in a drift, your car does feel significantly lighter so you can nudge your car mid-drift to slip through cracks in traffic obstacles. Swerving to dodge sliding spike strips isn't a trivial task however.\n\nAs with any Hot Pursuit entry, you should expect to find plenty of exotic sports cars and super cars. What is interesting is that Criterion managed to fit in some very modest cars like the Evo, WRX STi and RX-8 without feeling out of place in a roster filled with Lamborghini and Porsche. You will be drifting on dirt and wet roads in the Evo and weaving past city cars in a police issued WRX STi. Speaking of police liveries, they look particularly amazing on the entire roster of the Law side. They don't all come in black and white either, expect some true to life palettes like peacekeeper blue, ranger green and even a patriotic flag on the GT40.\n\n2010 saw the release of Hot Pursuit by Criterion as well as Blur by Bizarre and Split/Second by Black Rock. While I do approve of this one-off reboot, some people may disagree because this does effectively kill off any hopes of a new Burnout game. Whether you love or hate this game, what is universally agreeable is that 2010 was a great year for racing game fans who crave for the return of action packed alternative racing.","November 25, 2013","true","16.2"," 76 of 87 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","76","87","0","0"

Adrenaline, feeling the high speed and defeating other racers is what i like in racing games. Need For Speed is not expection. Original Most Wanted from Playstation 2 is the best Need For Speed for me but Hot Pursuit is that good too... almost.\nCurrently writing this review i have done 50% of this game and its pure fun.  Escaping cops and chasing illegal racers is always fun and challenging. Driving system is perfect for Arcade racing, Drifting is fun, graphics and sighseeing in this game is breathtaking. Enough of cars to drive as racer or cop. Map cointains variable playgrounds such as coasts, mountains, deserts forests, highways and clever and fast shortcuts. Free drive in this game is very one sided. You just spawn somewhere to map and you just drive and nothing else. I hoped there would been cops, side missions, hidden secrets and other racers.\nI Havent touch multiplayer yet but it looks nice what i have seen on internet. Autolog or also known as this game multiplayer system is made nicely and clean. If you have friends on autolog you can challenge them in single player missions to make better time, score etc. And you can see Friend's wall which shows their activity in this game. But otherwise if you are only looking for single player in this game, autolog is almost useless then.\n\nSummary:\n\nWhat i liked\n\n+Perfect "arcade" driving system\n+Being cop in this game is surprisingly fun\n+Map is breathtaking and fun to drive\n+Cars are sick!\n+And drifting! :D\n\nWhat i didnt like that much\n\n- Little car tuning in this game would been nice\n-Autolog useless if you are looking only for singleplayer\n-AI sometimes unfair\n-Free driving is big shame, nothing to do in there\n\nFun, chaos and extremely fun to play!

I launched this game and it took me literally 15 minutes to start playing. Here are some things you can look forward to if you buy this game:\n\n*Unskippable cutscenes all over the place, tons of them all the time\n*3rd party account registration\n*Automatic and uninvited use of your webcam\n*The game scraping your name from steam without asking\n\nI had a really great time being lectured by an annoying voice actor about how to play a video game for 10 minutes before I was allowed to play. I've never played a video game or used a computer before in my life so this was really helpful. It patiently explained that the career mode takes you through several races during which you gain points that can be used to buy cars. Did you know that the settings menu is where you can change the settings? THANKS FOR EXAPLINING THIS TO ME BECAUSE I AM A SUB HUMAN ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AND THANK YOU FOR NOT LETTING ME SKIP THIS BY PRESSING ESCAPE BECAUSE I CANNOT CONTROL MY ♥♥♥♥♥♥ HANDS AND THEY SMASH VIOLENTLY AGAINST THE KEYBOARD THE ENTIRE TIME I USE A COMPUTER I WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY UPSET IF I HAD ACCIDENTIALLY SKIPPED THESE TUTORIALS JUST BECAUSE OF MY FLAILING\n\nAnother feature I loved about this game was the unskippable "loading" screens where you are forced to watch cutscenes that show the track you're about to play on. I didn't setup a RAID 0 of SSDs and enough RAM to fit the entire game into volitile memory because I love to watch fake loading screens.  I played through Dark Souls 2 and saw maybe 1 minute of combined loading screens in 80 hours. I can load a map in CS:GO in about 2 seconds but  for some reason this game has 20 second long loading screens anyway. I am convinced there is a timer counting down the time until you're allowed to play the game; its sadistic.\n\nAnyway this game blows and don't buy it. If someone involved in the making of this game's UI is reading this then I hope you are forced to play the game because thats just about the worst punishment I can think of off the top of my head.\n\n","November 16, 2014","false","0.8"," 349 of 531 people (66%) found this review helpful 65 people found this review funny","66","349","531","65","25"

It kinda reminds me of Burnout because you can't skip the stupid talk there either.\nThe game menu is a horror and I can't use my gamepad to navigate in the menu.\n\nThe graphics are sometimes incredibly beautiful, but sometimes it's crrrrap.

The songs are boring and slow, contains mostly hipster indie rock and some very bad electro. There are maybe 3 songs that's ok (2 dnb and one metal song), the rest are totally inappropriate for racing. I'm talking about the playlist not the orchestral songs. So really, I disabled the in-game music and made my own playlist with adrenaline pumping songs. In a racing game I wanna race not to fall asleep.\n\nCar customization is non-existent, all you can do is choose from a  handful of colors. There is a car that has only one color.\n\nMultiplayer is really good, it's fun racing with friends, but you have to sign in to EA ♥♥♥♥♥, so it's a pain.\n\nIt's a fun game if you can get past the frustrating things like the soundtrack and menu controls.

The PC version looks great, and runs super smooth. Grab a controller and you'll experience one of the best arcade racers out there. The controls might seem a little difficult at first, but when you get use to the controls and unlock the better handling cars you'll have no problem driving like a maniac. Play as a racer, or a cop... each with a ton of stages to play.

I highly recommend it to anybody who is just looking for an arcade-type simple racing game to have fun and just relax, I think Need for Speed Hot Pursuit is the best choice on the market.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like about the game is perhaps the lack of advanced graphical settings and the default controls (which can be remapped in no time).

And then it hit me; I had - back in 1998. This wasn't just another Need For Speed game branded with the name of one of the more popular iterations of the series; it was a remake!\n\nNow, you have to understand; I loved the 1998 "Hot Pursuit" (aka Need for Speed III); released 16 years ago, it remains one of my favorite racing titles (it was /the/ favorite until Porsche Unleashed unseated it two years later). Its great levels, solid driving, stylish cars and kick-♥♥♥ soundtrack combined into an overall awesome package. Few of the later games in the Need For Speed franchise even approached the heights achieved by NFS3. But aging graphics and finicky hardware requirements meant it was increasingly difficult to relive the original experience. So when I started recognizing some familiar curves and sets in the 2011 remake, I got understandably excited.\n\nNot that the 2011 Hot Pursuit is a 1-to-1 remake; it's more of an homage, utilizing many of the familiar tracks but updated with modern graphics and an open world. Still, it's a glorious return to an era of Lambroghini's and Porsches squealing unsafely around hairpin curves on gorgeous mountain and desert tracks. The car handling is wonderful; not in the least bit realistic, of course (I call it "pinball racing" for a reason!) but it feels very solid. The tracks are varied and beautiful, with a nice mix of curves and straight-aways, with numerous shortcuts to add some variety.\n\nBut sadly, for every step forward the game makes a grievous step back. Worst of all is the AI, which is so tightly rubber-banded to the player as to remove all sense of challenge or achievement. How bad is it? Even when I cheated and disabled the AI entirely, my opponents were never further back than two seconds behind me. I never felt as if my skills were being fairly tested because there was never any distance between myself and the AI. It absolutely ruined the single-player experience. Almost as bad is how pushy EA is with their "Autolog" online service, without which a good three-quarters of the game is non-functional. I have no interest in the so-called "social" aspects of racing, but I'd have liked to check my race stats without having first create an account for yet another online service. Other missteps include an over-reliance on beat-the-clock races, a completely pointless free-roam mode, unskippable movies and an unbearable soundtrack.\n\nAll in all, the 2011 Need For Speed Hot Pursuit has the seeds of greatness - varied tracks, good driving, beautiful cars - and it kept me entertained throughout its single-player missions. But it erred in too many other areas for it to be considered as one of the highpoints of the franchise.\n","November 25, 2013","false","18.0"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","18","28","0","0"

What I got was a highly polished, shiny console port with all the fun and excitement of a coma.\n\nThe Pros:\nThe graphics are lovely even on my very average gaming laptop (Quad i7, Radeon mobility 5830) and the selection of cars is everything you could ever wish to drive in the real world.  The cars feel quite quick with all the motion blur and the roads aren’t too busy so there is less chance of frustration in that department.  Sound is pretty good but after a short while you notice there are only so many different engine sounds in the game...\n\nThe Cons:\nAs usual with EA games, LOADS of hoops to jump and advertising to watch.  Login's, 'dont turn off your computer while saving' screens and un-skippable marketing material mean waiting a good 3 minutes before actually driving anything!  Throughout the game there are loads of these tedious video's telling you how to drive, how the driving modes work (of which there are loads) and every time you win a new car (which is almost every race) you have to sit through a 30 sec video of it spinning and flashing!  Everything just takes soooo long...  Even the ill conceived open world landscape is empty and pointless.\n\nOnce you finally start to race the problems really begin.  I know NFS has never been a driving sim like Gran Tourismo but there have to be limits.  No matter what you drive, all the cars handle the same only with different max speeds and even then it doesn’t really matter.  The balancing for the AI is so severe that even if you crash throughout a race, the opposition is always just around the corner.  The same is true if you have a perfect race, a crash just before the finish will result in a 5th place finish as you CANNOT escape the opposition... ever...  The game play becomes monotonous and boring so fast i'd had enough after an hour of play each session.\n\nThere are countless other niggles but it all adds up to yet another poor racing arcade game.  Stick to the old ones if simple fun is even slightly important to you.","November 27, 2013","false","1.9"," 63 of 113 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","63","113","0","3"

There are beautiful landscapes compared with nice weather effects.\nI also like the seamless change of climes. For example, you're starting your race in a forest and are driving the way up to mountains where you'll get suprised by snow laying on the ground.\n\nIn the career mode you can choose between racers and cops. It keeps interesting because there are always different racing tracks and gamemodes. After every race you will earn points where you'll unlock cars which are divided in different tiers (sport series, exotic, ...). You can't tune or upgrade your car, you just choose your car and color.\nYou can use different abilites while driving like spike strips, turbo (racers), emp or blockades (cops). These are limited and well balanced - they're keeping the races interesting and exciting.\n\nThere is a freeride mode, but I think it's useless and boring, since you can't just challenge other AI drivers for a race or try to stop other racers as a cop. A "skirmish"-mode where you choose your map, gamemode and faction is also missing. A real shame, since the multiplayer is dead and you can't even drive with a friend against AI opponents.\n\nAnother point which annoys me is the AI behaviour. Sometimes they are acting realistic and clever, making mistakes, trying to push you aside or are using the special abilities to stop you and sometimes they're just cheating. Even if they crash and felt behind, they somehow manage to get close or even pass you.\nYou are using your nitro or turbo (special ability, more superior than nitro) and they just stick to your back like spiderman...\nThey also manage to get around corners too perfectly, they even pass you in curves :D\n\nI know they did this because they tried to keep it challenging until the end, but even if it's an (unrealistic) arcade racer, I really prefer a comprehensible artificial intelligence.\n\nConclusion:\nBesides those two points above, I recommend Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit to you guys.\nI had a lot of fun with it and I'm not a real big fan of racing games.\nIn my opinion Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit is one of the better Need For Speed games after Underground 2 and it really honours it's ancestors Need For Speed III: Hot Pursuit (1999) and Hot Pursuit 2 (2002).","August 8, 2014","true","38.9"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

Yes I do. However I say this yes with a bit of a weight. You're going to have to like the game quite a bit to stomach the loading screens (and auto log into screen)...\n\nAnyway,\n\nIn somewhat of a glorified version of Need For Speed : Hot Pursuit 2 - this Need for Speed : Hot Pursuit is a big update from the previously mentioned game. The graphics have been significantly upgraded and a lot of appealing cars have been added. Career is essentially overlooking the main map and choosing either police or racer events. Some events are a bit weird I found as I was finding myself in a time trial racing in a cop car. It made sense in a way sure you cut off some suspect at the end but it felt a bit gimmicky to me (I've mostly skipped those races and only done them when I had to progress to new events).\n\nAs a racer your given abilities just like the police have. Jammer of course sort of stuns the HUD of your police car or disables cops abilities. There is a spike strip also available for racers as well as EMP. Racers also have the ability to have turbo which just sends the car flying.\n\nPolice are able to use spike strips, call for a helicopter that can deploy a spike strip, call for a road block, or use an EMP as well. To be honest the EMP just locks on a removes some of the racers health... don't really like it. I personally liked back from NFS HP 2 you could call for a single car backup that would help slow down or ram the car.\n\nDriving is alright. This is as arcade as it can get. It seems they took Shift's 2 drift mechanism or something along those lines and made it the racing mechanic. Literally every turn you take I guess is mean to be a high speed drift. Again, this is where the original NFS HP 2 on PS2 or xbox was really good. Shift 2 for sure though takes the cake when it comes to driving games.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Well... not whole heartidly. I do like it but the loading screens, autolog, and the driving doesn't quite agree with me - so much that I'd rather be playing the game I mentioned earlier. The abilities are cool but I just don't feel the user interface is all the greatest either. No two player? Really? Of course you can play online but playing with a friend doesn't happen in this one. The issue also here is when you collide with a car - it doesn't feel like a collision. I don't feel the angle I hit at (P.I.T manouever doesn't really work) or how hard I hit properly registers. There's also the point where you can't simply play a quick race and adjust how many spike strips or road blocks you get. It's simply career with event races. This is why the game sort of has that gimmick feel to it. I feel a lot more could have been done here but perhaps given time constraints weren't enough.\n\nI'll recommend it but can't give it the highest of scores.\n\n7.1/10","November 20, 2014","true","6.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liberteer/recommended/47870/","liberteer","Fißtechead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liberteer/","503 products in account","I can clearly remember the sense of freedom and speed while driving Lamborghini Diablo VT down the Alpine track in original Need For Speed. I've skipped the second one and when Playstation (PSX, appearantly) was the best thing to own in the universe, I've lost countless hours playing the third one in the series, entitled Hot Pursuit - basically, as far as I can remember, the first one introducing the ability to play the game as a copper taking down racers.\n\nThat game was awesome and it's the main reason why I've bought this one.\n\nThe concept stayed the same - high tech super cars (licensed one and therefore - not too many bumps can be seen, although the game is delivered by Criterion Games) are racing down the road to the finish line. You're in one of those cars or you're in one of crazy hybrid police super cars taking down opponents by smashing into them, dropping spike belts, asking for road blocks and helicopters.\n\nGood amounts of cars and various tracks with shortcuts and traffic that can prove to be a determining factor between losing and winning are offered in this high speed arcade racer that stays true to original one (see I'm comparing it to 16+ years old game - yes, that's the one I've played like crazy). Sense of speed and tense situations are all there and you're gonna love every single second of it if you like adrenaline-pumping arcade racing games.\n\nThe fact that needs to be mentioned is that you need Origin account to access multiplayer mode and yes, there are people playing this game in multiplayer which is unbelievably awesome.\n\nI got it for 3,70 € on the discount. If you're thinking about getting a racer or NFS racer to be exact, get this one. I'm not saying it's the best, I'm saying it completely satisfies me as a player and delivers on multiple levels.","July 25, 2014","true","5.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

The game captures a huge chunk of California scenery from snowy peaks to seaside carnivals, and every area is a slightly different challenge.\n\nEffectively, there's multiple single player game styles:\nCop:\n-race against the clock with a specific car\n-bust speeders by smashing them with your car or various devices such as spike strips or roadblocks\nRacer:\n-A straight, no-frills street race\n-Racing, but with "wreck 'em" devices\n-Avoid the cops (sometimes with toys)\n\nOverall, the game is a thrill, flying along through beautiful scenery, keeping one eye on civilian traffic, one eye on your competition, and your third eye :) on the map to look for shortcuts.  Didn't enjoy physics in school?  Don't worry, because neither did the the NFS designers...you carom off guard rails and torture your $250,000 cars with no loss of speed or acceleration.\n\nBreakdown:\nCons:\n-Lots of menu screens.  This is partly due to the console nature of the game, with limited key options requiring multiple menus.\n\n-Lots of intermissions.  I'm guessing that the game needed to showcase each car in its stable as part of some contract, so you have to watch or skip lots of "car porn" shots of the camera lovingly sweeping around some fiberglass extravagance while a sultry female voice talks about "curves" and "power."  (Hmmm...is this a con?)\n\n-Spiky difficulty.  Time tests are by far the hardest modes, whereas it's pretty easy to get gold against five AI cars in street races.  Particularly tetchy are the cop time tests, where even the slightest brush with an obstacle costs you two seconds.  Plus, the cars you are forced to drive often wallow like pigs as you try to take a tight curve or thread some needle.\n\nPros:\n- Great value for your money.  Get it on sale for less than a movie ticket, and it's an excellent deal.\n\n-A true thrill.  Every time a "Fast & Furious" movie comes out, I get an overwhelming urge to play this game again.  It really captures the over the top fun of the fantasy street race, where you tear around like a demon in unrealistically light traffic, bashing cars, going offroad to shave a few seconds.\n\n-A good family game (for kids over about 8-9).  I wouldn't use this to teach my kids to drive, but there's no cursing, the crashes are cartoony and bloodless, and everyone walks away at the end, even if the car looks like used aluminum foil.  My 8 year old didn't care for the races, but loved to pick a car and just free-drive the countryside.\n\n-Beautiful graphics.  Seacrest county is a buffet of Southern/Central California terrain, and there's a lot of little details which really make it shine (tractors, observatories, redwood trees, desert vistas).  [***Caveat*** Without a little tweaking the lack of in-game anti-aliasing and anisotropy will gradually drive you insane.  However, you can fix all that by adjusting your graphics card settings out of game.]\n\n-Cool multiplayer.  I never played online against random opponents, but my 12 year old son got a huge kick out of spike-stripping his old man, or forcing my Lamborghini to crash into an oncoming pickup truck.\n\nSummary:\n\nWhy have an expensive mid-life crisis when you can spend a few bucks on this game to drive ridiculously overpriced cars at absurd speeds in a consequence-free environment?  Sure, by day you're a cubicle farmer, or working check-out at Whole Foods, but in the evening, you're a live-dangerously street racer who thumbs his nose at the cops.

It's pretty, but it's also pretty shallow.  Actually, it's like a gorgeous airhead who won't shut up about her favorite reality TV show, but we'll get to that (the cutscenes issue) in a minute.\n\nThe graphics in the game are undoubtedly beautiful.  I don't think anyone could argue against that point.  However, the gameplay itself is ultimately fairly hollow and weak.\n\nAdmittedly, I haven't gotten that far into the game, but from the outset, there's really not much differentiation among the cars.  Or at least, given the events I used them in, there didn't feel to be a ton of difference.  The cop side felt like the most fun because you got to smash into other racer cars and take them out.  The racer side was just the typical stuff.  As you progress up both ladders (which you can play simultaneously -- which is weird), you also unlock various gadgets for different events.  Spike traps, roadblocks, EMP blasts, helicopters, turbo boosts, blah blah blah.  It's supposed to spice up the gameplay, but it didn't do a ton for me.\n\nWhy?  Well, the game just feels...hollow.  For example, there's no storyline at all, so you have nothing compelling you forward.  Now, the other NFS game that I have on Steam is Undercover, and I'll be the first to admit that it's not like the story there was one for the ages.  It featured weak acting, overblown dialogue, etc.  But at least it provided you with...something.  Plus, you could customize your cars.  Yes, that's right. There's no customization in this game.  At all.  Well, not beyond selecting one of a limited number of paint colors for your car when you're a racer.\n\nIn this game, you unlock vehicles, but unlike most other racing games I've played, you have no ability to tune or otherwise customize them.  You're also limited in your choices based on the event you're in.  You don't buy cars, either.  You just unlock them when you level up...and that's it.  You get some voiceover reading you PR copy about the car that sounds like it was written by the manufacturer's ad department.\n\nThe cars themselves handled...so-so.  They don't seem to grip the road particularly effectively.  You slide around a LOT.  Now, it's not as bad as, say, flooring it in a Forza game, but then, this game isn't supposed to be anything like a Forza game.  It's an arcade racer, not a sim.  The end result is that the cars felt kind of annoying to drive much of the time.\n\nThere are two other really annoying features, though.  First is the game's built-in Facebook-like "Autolog."  Some idiot suit probably made the game developers include this, because it reeks of corporate brainstorming coming straight from the C-suite.\n\n"Put in social media.  Kids are into social media these days.  We need it in our games."\n\n"What?  But...it's a racing game.  They play the game to race.  If they want to talk to each other about the game on social media, they'll probably just...go to Facebook or Twitter for that."\n\n"We need that, too. We need to keep kids IN our game, instead of logging out to tell their friends about the Bugatti they just unlocked.  They can do it in-game now.  It's genius!!  Plus, we can use it for datamining."\n\n\nSo, you get a five minute cinematic that explains to you how you can connect to other players (which, especially five years after the game launched, is now pointless since I expect nobody is playing).  AND, you have to create an EA account, and log into it when you play.  Not. Cool.  To be fair, you don't have to be logged in to play the game, but the game throws this at you the first time you play, so the implication is that you need to.  It'll also search for the autolog connection for around 10 seconds, if it can't find it, each time you finish a race (because it needs to pust updates to your stupid autolog wall or whatever).\n\nProbably the most annoying part is all of the unskippable cinematics both before and during a race.  You can skip some of them at the start, but you're still forced to rewatch them if you want to restart the race.\n\nI got this game for around $10 on a sale.  Maybe a little less, actually.  I'd say it's a so-so buy at that price.","August 3, 2015","false","3.0"," 35 of 65 people (54%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","54","35","65","9","3"

По сравнению со всеми остальными NFS, Hot Pursuit действительно другая, в ней нет тюнинга авто, нет покупки авто, нет занудных копов, но это существенный плюсы к игре, в ней можно действительно расслабится, поездить на хороших, дорогих машинах, при этом, даже не усердствуя в получении их, просто поднялся до нужного уровня (всего из 20), включил гонку или свободный заезд и получаешь удовольствие от хорошей графики и красивых мест. Так же в игре добавили карьеру за полицейского SCPD, полицейские машины также доступны для гонок и свободный заездов, это еще один большей плюс. Много красивой музыки, которую можно самому переключать, это тоже плюс. Мультиплеер же полностью зависит от уровня в компании, и доступу к машинам.

I dont know why but it has this sort of charm to it, and the online play with friends is great. Its one of those games to get it for you and your friends to have fun and mess around in interceptor.  The AI is decent, and the level design is superb. But if you dont have agood pc you might no be able to run on max graphics, which is alright, but if you can only play on the lowest graohics it look awful.

While I hated so many of them, and praised with much glory High Stakes, Porsche Unleashed, Hot Pursuit 2 and Most Wanted, I say with confidence that this one is the best NFS I've ever played. Period. Nothing to question about.\n\nVisuals of the game are glorious, enough you'll love Seacrest County and will be exploring every scenery of it each race. But while the game isn't all graphics, the gameplay is also beautiful, and while you may find drifting pretty much like a hack and slash game which you press a button to backflip kill someone, you'll need to skill yourself in it and get better lines and better exit speeds as you play it. I guess the biggest fault of the game is the lack of a skill level on single-player, which is natural if you think this game is made to be played online with your friends.\n\nThe car list is certainly beautiful and pretty wide, ranging from entry-level sports cars such as the beautiful Porsche Boxster and the Mazda RX8, from icons of Japanese and North American automotive industry to the legendary Le Mans racer McLaren F1 (not the GTR though, a pity) and the overrated beast Bugatti Veyron SS, and the best: All of them in a similar playing field. While you'll soon discover Reventón is a monster in it's class, picking a similar Lamborghini will get you covered to match the concept bull aswell.\n\nWell, realism, if you want it, go to iRacing. You'll be drifting a Ford GT at 150mph while the turbo is on (don't question how does this turbo works or go mechanical into it, just accept it) avoiding a spike strip that the officer ahead of you on a limited-edition Nissan Skyline just dropped on you. This is an arcade - treat it like as it is, please. It's Need for Speed.\n\nWant my final advice? Buy it. It's still a 2010 game, but still pretty much fun.","November 3, 2014","true","11.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You unlock different cars as this happens.\n\nYou can also choose free drive, which is what I prefer and they give a small but diverse set of cars to choose from.\n\nThe cars handle fairly realistically, especially if you get the cockpit view rather than 3rd person.\n\nThe sound track is pretty lame compared to similar titles, but I suppose you can turn it off and play your own music in another program.\n\nIt's too bad they didn't make this game more like GTA V or Burnout: Paradise where you could do things in the world besides race past them.

Driving is more on the arcade-y side of things but without the fun element. Online servers have been shut since June 2014 and as the game doesn't offer local co-op, only thing left is the singleplayer which fortunately has decent amount of content where you can race as a wanted driver or as a cop.

The graphics in this game are great with beautiful landscapes ranging from snowy mountaintops to barren deserts and even a coastline. these great graphics include the  many diverse cars available throughout the game and for me the ability to play both the racer and cop sides adds intrigue to the game. Despite it having autolog and an apparent partial focus on multiplayer i rarely ever use such features but maybe thats just me.\n\nSome of the things i most enjoyed about ithe game (pros) is the diversity of amazing cars, playing both cop and racer sides, stunning landscaps and the free roam mode plus drifting is awesome.\n\nThere are some things i didnt like including a lack of customization options for cars which i like to see on nfs games, lack of free roam related missions or objectives and a few slightly boring race modes.\n\nAll in all this game's diversity of style of play, great graphics and freedom in play make for a classic and fun racing game that can be played for hours.\n","June 28, 2014","true","30.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Why? Some people say the game is to hectic, especially during chases with racers/cops, but that is something I absolutely want in any racing game.","December 2, 2014","true","1.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

No kidding. You're gonna cuss out your friends as they blast you with EMP (red shells), drop spike strips (triple banana!) and ram your pride and joy into oblivion on pristine Californian roads, be it in a stand-up race or a glorious battle to the death between corrupt cop and wealthy crook.\n\nIt's a very un-EA like game in some respects. By that I mean Hot Pursuit still has an awful online interface, but it's basically a complete game without DLC and fun offline, too. It has a solid campaign which should at least last a week of sporadic play. It's very very pretty and low intensity and will run on virtually any modern rig.\n\nSadly there's no customization and undercover gameplay. It's terribly unrealistic in terms of handling, vehicle dynamics and speed. Despite that, it's a far better competitive racing game than most of the NFS titles that came after it and offers a lot more refined value for your dollar. It's mostly glitch-free, absolutely gorgeous and a ton of fun to pick up at any time.

It lacks the immersive tuning of the games I mentioned, has no real freedrive (there is one, but there's almost nothing to discover on the map - not even cop chases will occur) and isn't set in an urban surrounding but much more on highways and country roads.\n\nAfter some time playing Hot Pursuit however I really started to like it. The races are much more challenging than any other NFS game I played, the different race modes can be amazing (the Hot Pursuit mode is so damn great!) and the range of cars available to unlock is immense. I personally wasn't so hyped about the Cop Mode and played it very little.\n\nIn the end, this game has not the underground racing, streetwise feeling Underground, Most Wanted and Carbon had but makes a really good effort in creating a scene where you focus on pure driving skills. A little Pro/Con list to sum it up.\n\nPRO:\n- graphics are very nice (note the release date, I know there are much better graphics on the market at the moment)\n- great range of cars\n- challenging\n- awesome Hot Pursuit game mode\n- no money grinding required for new cars/tuning equip\n- SpeedWall comparing your time with those of friends keeps some competition between you and your mates\n\nCON:\n- no tuning at all\n- cutscenes IN races can sometimes distract you which can be really saddening some times\n- online is dead\n- boring freeroam\n\nRecommended for people wanting to focus on driving skills rather than creating a personalized racemashine and showing it off in urban environment.","November 17, 2015","true","70.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

You just getting very fabulous-looking car models which you can operate on speed no-less-than-200kph, without any serious collisions on your way. In other words, this is an auto-xxx-show for 10-years-old.\n\nNo doubt, it sounds very cool to drive a Pagani Zonda or Bugatti Veyron at high speed, with colourful world behind your windows, and some Great Deeds to make - like to chase and punish some fugitives as a cop, or leave any traces far behind as an "underground racer". No doubt. But in Hot Pursuit it feels more like rolling plastic models (1:18 or even 1:43) rather than driving real carbon 500+hp monsters. And again, you can't even open doors or hood on those models, they go "just as it is". And I guess I should be thankful that wheels are spinning!\n\nWhat's really bugging me, though, is not that unnatural "plastic world" feeling. It is about notorious DRM system, breeded with an multiplayer, and proudly called Autolog. Some reviewers adding it as a plus to a game, but for me, it is pure and simple disaster. A cadaver mockingly presenting itself as Friend. I was hating it even when the multiplayer in the Hot Persuit was alive, but now, when it's dead, and the game still thinks that autolog is the main game feature, and trying to connect to server every freaking minute... It stinks, and I can't stand it. Even the Uplay seems the white sheep after that Autolog-DRM stuff...\n\nWhat I like in the Hot Persuit'10 is the visual part and tracks. They bringing some memories from the good old times... at least for a while.\n\nBut as of game in general, I really don't think it's good. Mediocre - maybe. Generic - for sure! For example - just listen to the cars voices... they are all nearly the same!\n\nHot Persuit is brighter at first than NFS Undercover... But have even less benefits, other than cars manufacturers names. At least, soundtrack in the Undercover was cool and delivering. As of Hot Persuit ost... it is bleak and insipid, The best song from it, in my opinion, is "Opposite Of Adults" by Chiddy Bang. And the whole game's alike. " Life is a party, I'm never growing up". Sweet sleeps, 10-years old fans of this product, I'm not from your sandbox, but I wish you well. Just not hate me, if I'm not fit for your gaemes.\n\nMy mark for Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit is 5.95/10. This is an empty shell behind colourful facade.

I mean, seriously, just load the game, let us chose a track, a car and we are fine. Spare us everything else and don't even bother making introductions, because we'll manage the rest.\n\nAfter the first race eventually started, I was amazed: This game has some very good and enjoyable graphics / visuals, but the rest - absolutely horrible.\n\nThe gameplay is, like almost every NFS game, an insult. Like always, all enemies are in one place. Meaning when you're hitting the wall, you're automatically last to finish.\n\nThere is absolutely NO feel of speed. Your speedometer reaches the 250 kilometers and it looks like you just comfortable cruisin' around the block. This was way better in NFS:UNDERGROUND. And on my bike last time when I drove to the bakery to buy some bread. But I ran a flat so I had to walk. But still way more impressive experience than this game.\n\nThe cars are absolutely HORRIBLE to drive. It's feeling like you're trying to steer a brick-wall through the corners. Yes, I understand that the cars are even worse to drive in reality, but this is supposed to be an arcade game. I would understand it when it's a simulator, but it's not. Never has and never should be.\n\nAlso, it's ridiculously hard. You have ALWAYS finish first to get some results. But don't worry, your enemies will do their best to ram you in the wall. And no, of course you can't do the same to them. We're speaking here of a NFS game, this just CAN'T be fun. And well, they really thought a race makes more fun after you tried (and failed) it 25 times, eh?\n\nI had this game for the PS3 and I only played as racer (I don't like playing a cop) - after finishing all races as a racer the game was... well, ready to kick the bucket. No reward, no nothing.\n\nWhat a waste of money and time and another awful example, how worse the series got. At least I only paid around 5 bucks for it.","February 7, 2014","false","1.3"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

And if you dare try to play an offline campaign, the game will force you to sit and read an advertisment for the feature before it will let you play. I'm not even sure if Autolog is supported any more, but it's as if the game itself is an ad for this feature, rather than the feature supporting the game. See that symbol on the game's picture? That's the Autolog symbol. What the hell.\n\nIn saying this, apart from being an annoyance, a lack of connectivity doesn't affect the gameplay itself. And the game is fun, if unforgiving at times. You can quite easily be eliminated within seconds of starting a race if you're not careful, however, the AI does allow you to catch up if you crash, and most of the cars handle very similarly, which is less realistic, but easier to pick up and play.\n\nAlthough there are many cool and gorgeous cars to race, there aren't many modes to be seen in the campaign - I've played 4 hours of the police campaign and all you can do is a Time Trial, 'Interceptor' (in which you chase down a single car), and Hot Pursuit (in which you chase down a whole bunch of cars). Chasing down crims is never tedious, and watching them roll through the air when you finally take them out is always satisfying.\n\nIf you can get this cheap, then it's well worth your time. It's just a shame that no matter how far back you go in the last 10 years, EA shows signs of trying to impliment consistently ineffective and insidious online features into their games, with little concern for the integrity of the title. If the game didn't play so well I'd accuse it of being nothing more than an ad for its community features.","January 9, 2014","true","4.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you have no racing games or if you are a fan of the Need For Speed series like me you should, but if you never played any game from the series then try to play other ones first.","June 3","true","7.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

You can choose to observe these races too. You can switch drivers and the view which can prove interesting. The server gets control of which class of cars you can choose ensuring the race is as far as possible. This will offer tons of replay value. While usually lag free it does have its down falls. Even when lag is evident it doesn't affect severely your driving, just displaces the other cars on the track. However, there are some noticeable bugs in the multiplayer mode, for example While trying to catch up to cars ahead of me, I noticed sparks were always flying from the cars. Also when they caught air it seemed like they were launching to the moon then back on the track.","January 4, 2014","true","124.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Driving in a high speed chase from the cops was a fun experince to have. Having to be the cop was a great experince to have if you want to be with the law and wrecking racers. There's a big list of cars ranging from everyday cars to one the most exotic and expensive cars in the world. They all have their unique characteristics of thier driving in Seacrest County. From the bulky Dodge Charger SRT8 to the lightweight Koeningsegg CCXR Edition. The county of Seacrest is a beautiful resemblance of four different enviroments mashed together with one of the most exhilerating roads I've seen in a modern Need For Speed game. The sounds in this game is mindbolowing. Where my head just couldn't handle it and I had to stop and catch myself before I pass out. Ok I'm kidding on that but really the vehicle sounds is really amazing.\n\nGraphics\nFor a 2010 game, I have to say that this game itself is a pleasuring beauty. All enviroments ranging from the mountains to the desert have a beautiful scenery that keeps the driver in awe while driving in a intense race. The details of each vehicle is really amazing with high tessellation that helps the vehicle look more realistic and more immersive to drive. The carbon fiber on the Koenigsegg CCXR for example is just amazing. The lighting effects is just beautiful from day to night. The weather effects has got to be the best I've seen so far in a Need For Speed game. Seeing the relfection on the wet surface is really fantastic. The textures of the road is just amazing with each road having their own unique style to it. Also since this game is made by Criterion games. It's not surprising that the damage model is just jawdroping from every crash that you witness. The only complaint I do have to say is that theirs no Anti-Aliasing to be found in the game.\n\nGameplay\nSince this game is supposed to bring back the original Hot Pursuit feel, there's obviously not going to be any customization. Which some people would complain but since all of this was based before Underground 1 and 2 it would make sense. Color picking has been reduced to manufatured paint only which is a bit disapointing. For the driving part, it's pretty fun driving every vehicle since they do have their own unique handling and drifting. What I thought was pretty interesting that the devopers added weight to the driving which makes it more realistic. For instance the Bentley Continental Coupe is a pretty heavy vehicle. It's pretty difficult to swerve the vehicle from left to right since it's a heavy car. For the Pangani Zonda Cinque, it's nimble so the car can swerve easily around traffic and the cops. This new pursuit weapon that Criterion Games added is a pretty cool feature. Each side (racer/cop) has some unique features that only one side can use (For instance cops can call in road blocks or a helicoptor whereas the racer can use either a jammer or turbo). In my opinion they'll seem to be balanced in a nice mannor. Freedrive is a decent experince since the player can use freedrive to test drive the car without having to deal with cops/racer or crashing out. The main downside is that since there's no option for a online freedrive, the replayability of that mode is small. This new social feature, Autolog, is a really nice feature that let's the player challenge their freinds, share photos and disscus. The downside to this is that people that has little to no friends will think that this feature is useless to them, but it's a not a flaw by any means. DLC wise..... well there's no DLC here becuase we know that EA doesn't like PC players that much besides Battlefield.\n\nConclusion\nThis game is a great succesor to the past Hot Pursuit games and I feel like this game is great for any casual or competitive players.\n\nPO. Trying this little feature out that Steam released and I thought that it would be cool to do this. :)","November 25, 2013","true","22.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

I just wish i could change that music for the regular soundtrack,because it makes my brain numb when i listen to the same song for 7 minutes straight,no changes at all,and the game mocks you!

I bought this game because I saw it in Steam after seeing a few dozens of positive reviews by series fans who were talking it's the best game in the whole franchise.\nWhat did I get? Disgusting music. Copy-pasted vehicles. Broken game mechanics. This game doesn't fit it's title at all: instead of dynamic races with smart opponents we are getting tons of catch-up, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ opponents who is just cheating all the time (if you are first and driving at 340 kmph it doesn't mean that some random half-broken opponent car can't outrun you, driving at 400 kmhp approximately). Game modes are mostly boring, actual pursuits take 10% of play time, other 90% is boring crap like races against the timer (for cops? really?). 1 cop vs 1 racer (and he will keep driving at impossible speeds easily going through curves without braking) and other kinds of boredom. In-game physics are bad beyond any point, don't even try to bust a racer by braking in front of him, he will just throw you away and won't get any damage), all vehicles have the same handling and differ by top speed and acceleration only (what is most hilarious, some of the cars doesn't have these characteristics in the description, having "classified" instead), it's almost impossible to actually crash (so you can forget about braking before turns). Also, the game is suffering from a major case of being overfilled with different opponent-side cheats, of course I understand that it is made just to made gameplay more interesting for a player, but sometimes it just looks idiotic: you, riding the top exotic car, cannot catch a guy who is driving some box-shaped american piece of metal, and even constant crashes can't keep him from winning.\nAnother problem is cars. We got used to have dozens of perfect concept cars in every NFS game, but now we are having just a few of them, mixed with dozens of ugly american crap like dodge, chevrolet and other same-looking metal coffins.\nAnd last, but not least, is the gameplay itself. You will not get interesting competitions with different opponents, you will get hundreds of same crappy races on the same highways. By the way, game map seems to be huge, but actually it's pretty small and consists of same highways with different backgrounds. Which are, I must say, very scenic and beautiful, but still not capable of making this game any better.\nAnd a few words about music: I was never a fan of music styles and genres that NFS usually had as a soundtrack, but at least it was very good in pair with gameplay. In this game it's just a dozen of generic tracks from hipster bands you can hear on every generic radiostation.","March 11, 2014","false","8.6"," 68 of 132 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","68","132","0","0"

You will achieve both by doing races, including a variety of new cars which you then can race with. Well.. which you can sometimes race with I must say, because for some reason the game has its own preferences for cars and in some races you are just left with 1 pick (while the game shows you more unlocked cars, which you can't pick for some reason).\n\nThen, there is no customization (sigh). A really big letdown for me, since this was what made the game series unique and was the biggest part of the reward system. This was what kept you playing, unlocking a new car, using your money to put some spoilers, wheels, neon lights etc. on it to make it your personal driving monster. Not being able to do this also made it less rewarding to unlock new cars like the camaro, which is one of my favorite cars.\n\nSo what about the leveling system, or the ranking system if you will.. well.. you unlock new cars and some new abilities (which you can only use for specific races), but thats pretty much it.. I felt no difference being a level 1 or a level 4 other than maybe difficulty.. Its just not rewarding enough anymore, since we all expect more.. If this game wasn't part of the nfs series, it would've been so much better.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics look average at best. I guess there went more time in actually letting players drive cars then the actual looks, which saddens me if i look back into the series. Most of the nfs games had pretty damn good graphics for their time, especially for a racing game. This wouldn't have bothered me as much if it were only the landscape, it is also the car models. I've seen way better looking car models in the older nfs's and I don't expect a game series like nfs's size to go worse in graphics.\n\nOk.. so far for the bad stuff.. lets recap a sec: there is (in my opinion) no real goal in the game other than winning races and gaining rank. The rewards are race specific abilities and cars, which are less rewarding since you can't even customize them. The graphics are average at best, the cars being the biggest let down for me (graphics wise).\n\nThe driving:\nSo what is GOOD about the game, why should you buy it if you dissagree with the above? well..  the racing is pretty good, I love the drifting and the way nitro works in this game. It adds alot of tactic/strategy to the racing, which is cool. You can cut alot of turns or you can try and always get nitro back by driving against traffic, closely passing by cars and drifting (against traffic). Drifiting also is really important. You shouldn't always drift, and when drifting you get the choice of the optimal route or the route where you get the most nitro of.\n\n\nConclusion:\nSo its up to you. my advice: if you look for a nfs game, just stay with carbon, it had really nice driving, police chases were epic (throwing wood of trucs to cut them off etc.), customization was still in the game and the game had somewhat of a story/sense of progression. If you are just looking for a racing game, don't really care about customization or graphics, but just (unrealistic) racing. Then this is your game. And ofcourse.. if you have 5 bucks spare.. you can look yourself and see if you share my opinion ^^!","November 25, 2013","false","7.0"," 36 of 70 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","36","70","0","3"

And so, I went on the internet and looked for the best racing games available out there and well, Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit was on the top of a lot of lists. I bought the game, played the game and well, I can honestly say that NFS:Hot Pursuit is probably the only racing game I'll ever need to have because, to put it simply, it has everything I've wanted in a racing game.\n\nWhen it comes to graphics and presentation, this game is simply...gorgeous. From the details of the cars to the realistic looking environments and weather to the slick and stylistic design of the user interface, everything just looks polished and well-done. Not to mention that the crashes in this game look absolutely stunning. Someone could probably record a bunch of the crashes in this game, compile them into a screensaver and it would be one of the best looking screensavers ever made! The sound is mindblowingly immersive (just listening to your engine roar as you achieve 100+ KPH through your headphones really make you feel as if you're inside that car) and the controls are exceedingly responsive and intuitive. Not to mention, the gameplay is pretty forgiving for those like me who could be considered fairly 'noob' to the genre and it has that fairly 'Arcade' style for the more casual players but it can still be incredibly fun and challenging for veterans and racing game enthusiasts.\n\nNeed for Speed: Hot Pursuit is an incredibly well-made and well-polished game that's great for just about everyone and is the type of game that should be on everyone's steam library.","April 20, 2014","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No open world to explore, no car customizations, no more cars that cost ingame money... nothing. But don't let this fool you. Criterion Games has built this to be a realisting, aracde like racing game. The gameplay is built to be fun and nothing else. The cars are free, so once they're unlocked go ahead and use them. The gamplay is easy to learn and is very balanced. The graphics are insane+car crashes are very amusing to watch. This is not what you'd expect from most NFS game but it might just be a whole lot better.\n\nMoving on the small issues I have with the game. First off, I have already mentioned the differences to other racing titles, and yes there are a lot of differences, but I really like the change of flavor. So thats not really a problem. Secondly, the game gets repetitive. You learn it quickly and after that, there's nothing else to learn. It's just the same kind of races over and over  again over again (#definitionofinsanityfarcry3). The last problem I have with the game is the time trials. I hate them, understand this.... you have to do perfectly on the course, take all the shortcuts, don't crash once then maybe you will get gold (the amount of bounty you get to level up depends on the medal placement the game uses). Even then it might not happen. I've been off by 0.03 seconds from getting gold, even worse, I've lost gold by 0.01s. Just stay away from the time trials and you will have a great experience.\n\nIn the end it's your decision on whether you get this game or not, but I'm telling you this... if you buy this game, you will not regret it. Straight up, its fun. I recommend everyone to give this game a try. -8/10","May 9, 2014","true","44.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I used to play Burnout Legends on XBOX and was looking for a similar game on Steam. That's when I purchased this one, judging by the review it seemed the closest to Burnout Legends.\n\nCareer ModeRacing game's Career mode is what I'm after, so I was really looking forward to the one in Need For Speed. No surprise here, it's about climbing the ladder and become a Most Wanted (or the cop version of it, haven't played it much, though). During your career you'll drive faster cars, perform more risky stunts, take more (intelligent) shortcuts and try to keep your opponents behind you.\n\nVery Hot PursuitThe game is very, very challenging. Very. If you think Burnout's Career mode is challenging, you've seen nothing yet. And I'm not talking about 80% through, I'm talking about 10-20%. This is both good and bad. With enough patience, you can improve your driving (and eventually beat the game). But it might just as well get you frustrated.\n\nProper Game Controller Support, Anyone?I used to think that driving games would be played best with a computer driving wheel controller, but that was actually more difficult than it was fun. Playing Burnout Legends using the XBOX controller was nice, so I was looking forward to a proper Game Controller Support. Unfortunately, Need For Speed fails to deliver. Although the controller is supported out-of-the-box the button mapping and the overall controller sensitivity feels to fragile. Seriously, when I play a car racing game that's about risky driving maneuvers I don't want the controls to be configured as if I had a think piece of glass in my hand that'd brake anytime soon. Admittedly, that's very subjective, but maybe there are others that are looking for the same thing that I was.\n\nCut The Videos, Please!In my career, all medals have to be gold. I don't know why, but I like to beat the score and finish the level, so to say. That's why I prefer cutscenes to be skip-able, restart the whole race quickly, load up a new level, etc. I've recently upgraded my setup and was expecting Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit to load and respond rather quickly. But the opposite is true: It takes f****ng ages to load, restart or quit a race. Seriously: Why does the game need to load (!) the whole map again when I just want to restart the race on the map that is already in memory?\nSorry, but this is one of the biggest annoyances with this game for me.\n\nSpeedwall? Forever Alone!After every race I'm presented with a Speedwall which I suppose is some kind of highscore. Only problem is: I'm the only one on that list. No one to compete with, not even strangers from the server. Only my score. Yes, I get it, the game is not the newest one available, and propably none of my friends even plays it. But then please let me challenges other players from around the globe and compare to some international ranking.\n\ntl;dr: Summary+ Very challenging\n+ Integrates with Big Picture\n+ Native XBOX 360 USB Controller support\n+ Nice graphics\n+ Great, motivating soundtrack\n+ Fun to play\n\n- Very challenging\n- XBOX 360 USB Controller configuration/sensitivity doesn't match a racing game\n- Shortcuts can be well-hidden and often require a good knowledge of the map\n- Autolog is annoying. Signing up for an account? - I'm logged in to Steam already!\n- Online leaderboard doesn't work or is not available\n- Incredible long (and unnecessary) loading processes, even for restarting only a race on that very same map. Seriously?","November 13, 2014","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What else is there to say? I love this title and Criterion has resurrected the franchise from it's recently unpleasant past. Aside from the normal evasion/pursuit events, this title includes free-roam in both normal cars as well as their law enforcement counterparts. While I do think Most Wanted is even better as a strict run-from-the-cops title, you simply can't beat being the cop yourself. Perhaps the best part is that while this does unfortunately require an EA/Origin account login, it runs within Steam! Unlike later titles (like Most Wanted) which have been forced into the unstable-at-best Origin platform. Lots of fun - especially if you can grab it on sale. Definitely recommend it.","December 11, 2014","true","32.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is balanced, fun and fast! All you need for a Need for Speed game in my oppinion. For people wondering, the game is not dead at all! It is easy to find and join a match with 5+ players in it. Sometimes you even grab the last slot available in a lobby. Sounds and models are also very,very good. Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit is a real blast to play with friends!

The game should last most people awhile with an almost endless amout of races and challenges.

They actually did it right.\n\nNow, this isn't a game that's traditional to the NFS Franchise, there's no open world, and of course, you can play as the cops as well, but to me, this game is a lot like Carbon without the open world, and more fast paced and suspenseful than Carbon could of even dreamed of.\n\n~Pros\n+Driving in this game seems a lot more suspenseful and genuinely fun than other NFS titles (not all, however)\n+Drifting system in this game may not be realistic, but they absolutely nailed the drifting system for something arcade style.\n+Vehicle selection is absolutely awesome, the roster might not be as big as other titles, but I find I can drive every single car and enjoy it.\n+Multiplayer is absolutely -awesome-. there's much less lag than other NFS titles, and the Hot Pursuit mode is wicked fun.\n+Easy to pick up, put down, or play consistently, casual and hardcore friendly.\n+Keyboard support is phenomenal compared to other NFS titles, it doesn't feel like you NEED a wheel or controller.\n\n~Cons\n-No Open World\n-Multiplayer community is lacking (as all racing games suffer.) (matchmaking can take a while.)\n-Very limited graphics options (Is not old-pc friendly, but the awesome optimization from Dice allows for low-end PC's to run it fine at 30-60 fps with minimal frame drops)\n-Occasional frame drops on low end systems.\n\n~Toss-ups\n*Arcade style racing, this is NOT a sim.\n*Power-up style gameplay on some races, EMP's, Spike Strips, etc, this fits perfectly imo because of being able to play as police.\n*Drifting System is not realistic, however, imo, this the first game to nail an arcade style drifting system, no other game competes.\n*Cars auto-unlock in an order, all cars however remain driveable, there is no purchasing system, you get cars by getting reputation through driving and have access to all cars you have unlocked at all times.\n*Solid change-up from the traditional NFS franchise, however, imo, it's a very well done change-up, and is definitely a fun title worthy of being deemed Need For Speed.\n\nImo, I absolutely love it, the frame drops can be tedious, but my system isn't very good, you may never get those, don't let my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ system discourage you. I also dislike the lack of an open world, however, there's so much veriety in this game I cannot find myself to get bored with this title, it's just awesome and I'm striving to hit those gold medals on every race, the arcade drifting system is insanely well done, and while some people might think of it as NFS meets Mario Kart, they're far from right, this has got to be the most fun action/racing combo I've ever played, and it blows every Burnout title out of the water.\n\n8.5/10","July 31, 2014","true","18.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay consist of hot pursuit, racing, and reach your destination on time. You can't upgrade your cars; the game rewards you with new cars as you progress. In my opinion the shortcuts are not always rewarding. Most shortcuts are hard to enter especially the yosemite map with rocks and trees in the middle of the road and some of them are not shortcuts at all.

I've been hooked on NFS for about 4 years now, and I've played Most Wanted 2012 and World (Free MMO) since then. This game never ceases to amaze me with the graphics, the adrenaline, the challenging challenges, and the replay factor. It doesn't get boring and single player is always fun. I found that with Most Wanted 2012, as soon as I finished the game, there wasn't much else to do, and it got boring as the variety wasn't really there with the small map and lack of cop career. That is not the case with Hot Pursuit, and there is little to complain about in this game.\n\nOne thing that I did find to be irritating at times was that the AI was sometimes unfair. Sometimes as a cop I'd be playing a hot pursuit event, and one of the other racers would crash into a traffic car. It'd then respawn and accelerate insanely quickly and pass by me like a rocket. I found it to be unrealistic and unfair, but it didn't really affect my experience very much because the rest of the game was just so well made that my entertainment was not influenced at all.\n\nI wish people would play multiplayer, but I don't really blame anyone seeing as this game is old now, and I should have picked it up earlier in my lifetime. Nevertheless, I can still proudly say that this purchase was worth it. So far, it is my favorite NFS game of the new generation (Criterion Editions) that I have played. I can't speak for Rivals, but I'm assuming the experience I would have playing it would be within the ballpark.\n\nFinal Verdict: 9/10","May 27, 2014","true","45.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

But I'm thankful this is the one I have.\n\nPros:\n- The graphics are very good for being a few years old, and I hear it runs on lower end computers as well. Like, this game could've come out in 2014 and still be great.\n- Driving feels solid and real. Taking close corners never felt better driving your favorite car. Might want a controller, but my brother uses a keyboard and does fine.\n- Community? You can't talk ever. I met a Russian online and at the end of the race we just flashed our high-beams at each other. True bliss. 10/10 would race with him again.\n- No DLC. No more cars. No feelings to fork more money for more stuff.\nCons:\n- Music isn't the absolute best. I've heard better in NFS Carbon. But it's ok because you can just blast your own tunes in your favorite music player.\n- The online feels kinda clunky sometimes, but once you understand it, it's ok. This is EA after all, the twerps that made Origin. Stop trying to be Steam. Just stop.\n- There isn't the LARGEST selection of cars, but there are enough to drive each of them for a while. (I have over 700 miles in the Bugatti Veyron right now.) Also, you can't customize your car, which to me was kinda heartbreaking. The gamemakers said something about trying to make the cars look beautiful without customization. And they do look beautiful, but I would've liked customization.\n\nIn conclusion, the cons are very small, and the pros outshine the small problems. I've logged plenty of hours, and plan to put more into.\nThis is a good game to just boot up, blast some tunes, let out some fumes, drift some corners, and rev some engines.","September 23, 2014","true","75.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I found that with Most Wanted 2012, as soon as I finished the game, there wasn't much else to do, and it got boring as the variety wasn't really there with the small map and lack of cop career. That is not the case with Hot Pursuit, and there is little to complain about in this game.\n\nOne thing that I did find to be irritating at times was that the AI was sometimes unfair. Sometimes as a cop I'd be playing a hot pursuit event, and one of the other racers would crash into a traffic car. It'd then respawn and accelerate insanely quickly and pass by me like a rocket. I found it to be unrealistic and unfair, but it didn't really affect my experience very much because the rest of the game was just so well made that my entertainment was not influenced at all.\n\nI wish people would play multiplayer, but I don't really blame anyone seeing as this game is old now, and I should have picked it up earlier in my lifetime. Nevertheless, I can still proudly say that this purchase was worth it. So far, it is my favorite NFS game of the new generation (Criterion Editions) that I have played. I can't speak for Rivals, but I'm assuming the experience I would have playing it would be within the ballpark.\n\nFinal Verdict: 9/10","May 27, 2014","true","45.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

As I played the game on console, I realized that it had a great story line, but the graphics were a bit drab. So after about 2 days of having the game, I sold it back to GameStop, purchasing a Steam Card, for the Summer Sale. Without thinking any further, I purchased the game on Steam, as I knew I wasn't feeling the full effect without playing it on PC.\n\nAfter playing the game for an hour or so on PC, I realized how high-detailed this game is, for it's time. Sure it's not the best game out there (comparing it to newer titles like Forza 5), but this game is indeed a graphical wonderland. The physics, the textures, the storyline, the price, are all a crucial factor when it comes to reviewing this game.\n\nThe graphics, like I previously mentioned, are definitely better than I had anticipated (even on console. Can you believe that?). The shadow effects, textures, reslolution, anti-aliasing, everything seemed to be rather well-produced, compared to other games of it's time (ie: Grand Theft Auto 4).\n\nStory. I am not one who typically likes the storyline of Need For Speed titles, being they vary from title to title, but this one was one of the better ones. Rather than having to stick to a specific story, you have an option to merely choose your side; cops or crooks. Regardless which side you choose, it's a a ton of fun.\n\nThe online experience is pretty good as well. I love playing games online, but I was a bit of a skeptic when it came to playing this game online. But after playing a few rounds, I felt that it was pretty addicting, to be honest.

I have played a large amount of games between those on Xbox and on PC, and I would have to say this game is in the top 3.\n\nCons: I think car customization should be offered, as that is a necessity in having the perfect car. Game gets a bit repetitive after some time, of continually doing the same runs. Online community is a bit dried up, compared to other online games.

The reboot of Hot Pursuit is crazy chaotic fun, which is to be expected from a company like Criterion. I'd say this game is perfect if it weren't for some very obvious choices on EA's part. Some things can annoy the heck out of the player, like EA's account creation and the inability to skip some very annoying scenes. The scenes do later go away after the first playthrough making getting into the actual gameplay much faster.

The career mode is a lot of fun, both as racer and as cop and you can switch back and forth.\n\nThere are a lot of racing slobs.  it's a genre that invites that sort, and I am sure there are plenty who slag on this game and others of its ilk incessantly.\n\nIt's great fun.

And so, I went on the internet and looked for the best racing games available out there and well, Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit was on the top of a lot of lists. I bought the game, played the game and well, I can honestly say that NFS:Hot Pursuit is probably the only racing game I'll ever need to have because, to put it simply, it has everything I've wanted in a racing game.\n\nWhen it comes to graphics and presentation, this game is simply...gorgeous. From the details of the cars to the realistic looking environments and weather to the slick and stylistic design of the user interface, everything just looks polished and well-done. Not to mention that the crashes in this game look absolutely stunning. Someone could probably record a bunch of the crashes in this game, compile them into a screensaver and it would be one of the best looking screensavers ever made! The sound is mindblowingly immersive (just listening to your engine roar as you achieve 100+ KPH through your headphones really make you feel as if you're inside that car) and the controls are exceedingly responsive and intuitive. Not to mention, the gameplay is pretty forgiving for those like me who could be considered fairly 'noob' to the genre and it has that fairly 'Arcade' style for the more casual players but it can still be incredibly fun and challenging for veterans and racing game enthusiasts.\n\nNeed for Speed: Hot Pursuit is an incredibly well-made and well-polished game that's great for just about everyone and is the type of game that should be on everyone's steam library.","April 20, 2014","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I used to play Burnout Legends on XBOX and was looking for a similar game on Steam. That's when I purchased this one, judging by the review it seemed the closest to Burnout Legends.\n\nCareer ModeRacing game's Career mode is what I'm after, so I was really looking forward to the one in Need For Speed. No surprise here, it's about climbing the ladder and become a Most Wanted (or the cop version of it, haven't played it much, though). During your career you'll drive faster cars, perform more risky stunts, take more (intelligent) shortcuts and try to keep your opponents behind you.\n\nVery Hot PursuitThe game is very, very challenging. Very. If you think Burnout's Career mode is challenging, you've seen nothing yet. And I'm not talking about 80% through, I'm talking about 10-20%. This is both good and bad. With enough patience, you can improve your driving (and eventually beat the game). But it might just as well get you frustrated.\n\nProper Game Controller Support, Anyone?I used to think that driving games would be played best with a computer driving wheel controller, but that was actually more difficult than it was fun. Playing Burnout Legends using the XBOX controller was nice, so I was looking forward to a proper Game Controller Support. Unfortunately, Need For Speed fails to deliver. Although the controller is supported out-of-the-box the button mapping and the overall controller sensitivity feels to fragile. Seriously, when I play a car racing game that's about risky driving maneuvers I don't want the controls to be configured as if I had a think piece of glass in my hand that'd brake anytime soon. Admittedly, that's very subjective, but maybe there are others that are looking for the same thing that I was.\n\nCut The Videos, Please!In my career, all medals have to be gold. I don't know why, but I like to beat the score and finish the level, so to say. That's why I prefer cutscenes to be skip-able, restart the whole race quickly, load up a new level, etc. I've recently upgraded my setup and was expecting Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit to load and respond rather quickly. But the opposite is true: It takes f****ng ages to load, restart or quit a race. Seriously: Why does the game need to load (!) the whole map again when I just want to restart the race on the map that is already in memory?\nSorry, but this is one of the biggest annoyances with this game for me.\n\nSpeedwall? Forever Alone!After every race I'm presented with a Speedwall which I suppose is some kind of highscore. Only problem is: I'm the only one on that list. No one to compete with, not even strangers from the server. Only my score. Yes, I get it, the game is not the newest one available, and propably none of my friends even plays it. But then please let me challenges other players from around the globe and compare to some international ranking.\n\ntl;dr: Summary+ Very challenging\n+ Integrates with Big Picture\n+ Native XBOX 360 USB Controller support\n+ Nice graphics\n+ Great, motivating soundtrack\n+ Fun to play\n\n- Very challenging\n- XBOX 360 USB Controller configuration/sensitivity doesn't match a racing game\n- Shortcuts can be well-hidden and often require a good knowledge of the map\n- Autolog is annoying. Signing up for an account? - I'm logged in to Steam already!\n- Online leaderboard doesn't work or is not available\n- Incredible long (and unnecessary) loading processes, even for restarting only a race on that very same map.

No open world to explore, no car customizations, no more cars that cost ingame money... nothing. But don't let this fool you. Criterion Games has built this to be a realisting, aracde like racing game. The gameplay is built to be fun and nothing else. The cars are free, so once they're unlocked go ahead and use them. The gamplay is easy to learn and is very balanced. The graphics are insane+car crashes are very amusing to watch. This is not what you'd expect from most NFS game but it might just be a whole lot better.\n\nMoving on the small issues I have with the game. First off, I have already mentioned the differences to other racing titles, and yes there are a lot of differences, but I really like the change of flavor. So thats not really a problem. Secondly, the game gets repetitive. You learn it quickly and after that, there's nothing else to learn. It's just the same kind of races over and over  again over again (#definitionofinsanityfarcry3). The last problem I have with the game is the time trials. I hate them, understand this.... you have to do perfectly on the course, take all the shortcuts, don't crash once then maybe you will get gold (the amount of bounty you get to level up depends on the medal placement the game uses). Even then it might not happen. I've been off by 0.03 seconds from getting gold, even worse, I've lost gold by 0.01s. Just stay away from the time trials and you will have a great experience.\n\nIn the end it's your decision on whether you get this game or not, but I'm telling you this... if you buy this game, you will not regret it. Straight up, its fun. I recommend everyone to give this game a try. -8/10","May 9, 2014","true","44.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But I'm thankful this is the one I have.\n\nPros:\n- The graphics are very good for being a few years old, and I hear it runs on lower end computers as well. Like, this game could've come out in 2014 and still be great.\n- Driving feels solid and real. Taking close corners never felt better driving your favorite car. Might want a controller, but my brother uses a keyboard and does fine.\n- Community? You can't talk ever. I met a Russian online and at the end of the race we just flashed our high-beams at each other. True bliss. 10/10 would race with him again.\n- No DLC. No more cars. No feelings to fork more money for more stuff.\nCons:\n- Music isn't the absolute best. I've heard better in NFS Carbon. But it's ok because you can just blast your own tunes in your favorite music player.\n- The online feels kinda clunky sometimes, but once you understand it, it's ok. This is EA after all, the twerps that made Origin. Stop trying to be Steam. Just stop.\n- There isn't the LARGEST selection of cars, but there are enough to drive each of them for a while. (I have over 700 miles in the Bugatti Veyron right now.) Also, you can't customize your car, which to me was kinda heartbreaking. The gamemakers said something about trying to make the cars look beautiful without customization. And they do look beautiful, but I would've liked customization.\n\nIn conclusion, the cons are very small, and the pros outshine the small problems. I've logged plenty of hours, and plan to put more into.\nThis is a good game to just boot up, blast some tunes, let out some fumes, drift some corners, and rev some engines.","September 23, 2014","true","75.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It is balanced, fun and fast! All you need for a Need for Speed game in my oppinion. For people wondering, the game is not dead at all! It is easy to find and join a match with 5+ players in it. Sometimes you even grab the last slot available in a lobby. Sounds and models are also very,very good. Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit is a real blast to play with friends!

Other than the Shift series, they all have same open world feel/layout/etc\n\nI see a number of reviews stating that this is 'the best NFS game', to which I strongly disagree.\n\nThe first NFS Shift game was and still is one of the best as far as the driving/racing experience is concerned.  Granted, it doesn't have missions, open world, rivals, cops/racers, etc, but it IS a 'Need For Speed' game, and I think if they could blend the upgrade system and driving experience from Shift with the open world and polished feel of the Most Wanted, it WOULD be the best.\n\nRivals is the same game, essentially, but more polished.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/robo-venom/recommended/47870/","robo-venom","Roxas, it's ME","http://steamcommunity.com/id/robo-venom/","182 products in account","This is hands down one of the best arcade racers I've played, but it's not without its faults. Let's begin with the down sides to the game:\n-The Ai is too clingy and elastic, it will shoot right back at you.\n-The stats of the cars don't matter. No matter if the have the fastest Lambo, a slower Aston will always beat you.\n-Events can begin to repeate and get boring\n-There's no satisfaction, only hatred after a race.\n-Music is hands down the worst I've heard in a game.\n-It's too linear, weapons are restrictive to certain events\n- The game forces you to choose from a seclection from only two cars during some events\n- Unlocks seem pointless, due to the fact that you can't drive these cars until 10 races later, but by then you will have unclocked a faster set of cars.\n- Game punishes you by not connecting to autolog\nNow onto the plus sides of the game:\n+ The games is very pretty, both at night and during the day.\n+ The cars are very individual and throaty\n+ The handling of the cars are very nice to control\n+ Scenery is beautiful\n+ Cops are a nice tocuh to the game.\n+ Cars seems throaty and heavy.\n+ The free drive is very relaxing and gives you practice on the tracks.\nAll in all, I'm going to give this game a 7.9/10\nIf the game was less restrictive and linear, I would give it a 8 or even a 9. At the time of rating, the game has decided to delete my game save file, and as a conclusion, I have gathered a complete save file from online and has taken all progression from the game. I would recommed this game, but only slightly. The faults can be overlooked, but can get to you after a while.","July 25, 2014","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

There are over 60 cars included in the game (I'm referring only to different car models, not the actual car number, which is 110). The hot pursuits are not that great like in NFS Most Wanted, but the cop chases are very fun to play.

There is also free roam which can be quite fun, it also comes with the possibility of multiplayer but hardly anyone plays that, however there are steam groups out there who will play with you!

It's companies like EA and Activision that will feel the PC gamers revenge when consoles start to die in the next 5-10 years.","April 1, 2011","true","36.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

Need for Speed Hot Pursuit graphics are beautiful. Now that I got that out of the way lets go into what the developers did wrong in this game that misses the mark for me, a long time hard-core Need for Speed fan that's been there since game one.\nUnforgivable #1 - They dropped the gear shift. Need for Speed was never an easy game to master but once they dropped the gear shift it became impossible for me. Anyways I've always loved the thrill of shifting gears and waiting for the rpm's to hit that sweet spot. It's was also an excellent way to control your speed on sections of the race track where excess speed gets you into trouble.\nUnforgivable #2 - Poorly defined short-cuts and short-cuts that in reality are long-cuts. Nothing frustrating like seeing a short-cut then need inhuman reflexes to use it even when you even know exactly where it is and long-cuts are just cheap when it's hard just to get on. Even then the short-cuts are hard to tell where to turn on them and you find yourself smacking into the wall going 'which way do I turn, which way do I turn?' to yourself.\nUnforgivable #3 - Exceedingly long loading time for each race compounded on the fact that even on restarts you get the same exceedingly long load. You know what? I don't mind the first long load, I'll wait for it but if I'm restarting a race because of a minor mistake racing and I'm going for gold, waiting another two minutes for it to reload is madding. The track and race are already in memory, why torture me with the reload? Especially if I'm trying to get around a difficult spot with it fresh in my mind?\nNeed for Speed I-III on the Playstation never tortured me with these unforgivables. Those versions were hard too but this newest version upgrades and all just drive me nuts. Some days I love this game but most I hate it but because I'm a Need for Speed freak I just don't have the heart to un-install it. Maybe this is a good game for others who haven't played the Playstation versions and don't know what they are missing and learned bad habbits from the first three but as a hard-core Need for Speed fan I still can't recommend this game because I know where the orignal magic came from and it's not in this one.","July 21, 2015","false","9.4"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

I actually really (guiltily) enjoy the NFS franchise, but this one misses the mark in a few ways:\n1. You can't customize your cars. I know this is a strange gripe (and wasn't a feature in previous MW titles), but after playing racing games with fine tuning and visual customization, this is a big miss for me. Instead you simply unlock cars (which feels oddly like a chore and that's coming from someone that spends HOURS on time trials if need be).\n2. Seriously, eff those cut-scenes.\n3. If you unlock something, you can't hit "x" to replay, it takes you all the way back out. Minor gripe, but annoying when you're GT license style working on a track.\n4. It doesn't give me the option to pick from any car NEARLY often enough. Being locked to one or two cars is lame.\n5. No story, not even an attempt.

Once upon a time NFS involved a bit of acrade-style racing that was fun.  These cars handle more like hovercraft:  If you see it, you WILL hit it.  They decided to add the popular 'it takes time to turn your steering wheel' mechanic, which, let's face it:  Is completely bonkers for a decent racing game.\nI only played the police side of it, so maybe the actual 'racing' part is better, but...  I doubt it.  The physics just don't seem to support the ability to actually turn without 'drifing'.  Even at speeds greater than 150 in cars that are built to add down-force, the game designers seemed to think that drifting will still make you turn better.\n\nIn other words, the game tries too hard to be 'realistic' with it's steering/physics system while ignoring the effects of downforce on cornering, to the point that it becomes pointless to play.  Then they added a drifting mechanic to try to make up for it, which is completely unrealistic.","January 4, 2015","false","6.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","3"

I said little because that's the truth here, there is so little to do, almost nothing. I feel like the only thing to do is playing multiplayer races. If you consider buying this, only do so if it is ON SALE. I'm giving this game a downvote because you should not have to pay money for a game this thin and dissappointing.\n\nPros:\n\n-The multiplayer. You only have very few mods though, and after two days of playing you know every single racing track (like, every single one of them)\n-The graphics. Definitely not top-notch but it fits the game and the lighting effects are really cool and seem realistic.\n-The sounds. Nothing out of the ordinary here, the music tracks are a matter of taste. The intro is way too loud though.\n-The driving. It feels nice and responsive, nothing bad about it.\n\nCons:\n\n-The singleplayer. I don't think EA was sober when they made this. Its an insult.\n-Stuff besides the racing. No tuning, you may only choose from some colours to spray your car in.\n-The tracks. Repetitive, but not always lame, cool shortcuts but overall not enough diversity.\n-(The multiplayer. As I said, its fun, but you've got so few modes that it gets boring pretty quick.)\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis game could have been so much more. Its a dissappointment. If you want to play a better multiplayer racing game from the NFS series, try the new Most Wanted (Singleplayer sucks here, though). The multiplayer has a whole city, cool modes and is just way more interactive when playing with friends. So, don't buy Hot Pursuit, better get Most Wanted or something else because this here is not what I would call a good game.","December 18, 2014","false","23.0"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","2"

The other one didn't have a nitro boost, but im glad some changes didn't ♥♥♥♥ up the badass gameplay. The only sidedown about the game is the online lobbies, they don't fill as quick, so you need many friends to play. Though it could be since i can only play the beginner modes.

I hadn't played a racing game in quite a while beforehand.\n.. and I was disappointed. I remember playing Hot Pursuit 2 in the past on the Gamecube? or some console around that time and it was pretty cool.. it had good visuals for its time, an awesome soundtrack, fun levels, and a great car selection complete with the ability to freely set up tracks and play as you want alone or with friends. That was a cool game.\n\nThis one isn't.\n\nVisually it looks good. The music is.. meh. The music is boring. The title or level select screens don't have that awesome upbeat style the older Hot Pursuit games did. Its so dark and boring.\n\nThe actual levels have a limited selection of vehicles of choice. The sense of speed is pretty good, but the levels are very very basic. Despite being a more arcadey game, it kind of felt like you should just play a racing simulator instead.\nIts like, a weird in-between of arcadey awesome and simulation and fails to deliver on either.\nThere are some more arcadey game modes where you drop spike traps and things like that and they're just boring. Being chased by cops is dull.\n\nThe whole game is incredibly bland. Oh, and there isn't even a free-play mode where you choose a level and any car you\nwant + other settings like cops on or off, difficulty, and a bunch of other things the old NFS games had.\nYeah, that doesn't exist at all. There's multiplayer but I never tried it. All you get is a singleplayer campaign with no story and limitations.\n\nMaybe I didn't give it enough of a chance but I found myself tired of it too early on to keep playing.\nThis game just isn't very good and there are much better racing games out there.","January 24, 2015","false","3.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Granted it has the greatest thing a NFS game can do, that is to let you be a cop, which I must say, is amazing. If you're wanting the new NFS game that's coming out for PC in early 2016, I'd suggest to get this game now to hold you over till it comes out, because let's all be fair, we'll use Origin if that game is any good and we know\nwe\nwant\nit.","October 4, 2015","true","1.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

You may find this game too difficult at times, though not so if you are 'perfect' and never crash (due to the scripted opponents).  The sounds are pretty good (definately OK here), and the music is 'just ok' - unless you're a kid these days, it most likely won't appeal too much to you (there is a song by Black Rebel Motorcycle Band in here though so take what I say with a grain of salt).  Shut the music off an leave your own playlist on Winamp or media player for windows if it bothers you - easy enough fix.  Opponents are scripted to give constant challenge.  There is no 'easy' 'medium' or 'hard' settings - with which brings me my biggest issue.  I *LOVED* playing need for speed III hot pursuit on my old pentium 2/3 computers back in the end of the 90s when I was underage in High School, and I bought this game on sale (so I can't complain that much) to see if it had the same flair.  This game will definately fit the bill if you like racing games, but I Implore to you as a potential customer that it IS NOT the same game.  I don't know what's happened to EA over the last few years, but they don't make the same games they used to.  Seems like the last 10 years, they have been changing the way opponents are scripted to 'race' with you, so that to always provide challenge, they always 'keep up'.  This RUINS the feeling of accomplishment, entirely.  If they're always right behind, you'd think that'd keep me on my toes, NO, that just keeps me crashing :x   This is not the GAMES fault, it's the fault of the human mind (that's also why police chases work, and this is HOT PURSUIT so this could have entirely been planned).  I am not just talking about police chases.  I still recommend this game entirely, wholeheartedly.  Just keep in mind when you buy this that the opponenets will go a set speed when ahead of you, and boost like crazy to keep up to you.  Top Gear 1 and 2 for the SNES *DID THE SAME THING* I am not kidding one bit - and we all loved those games (if we were old enough, I was a pre-teen for those).  There should be more of a difficulty curve, not just one-difficulty-fits-all.  Even easy-medium-hard, with set speeds for the opponents.  Let me disable BOOST if I'd like some non-boost racing.  I'd also whole-heartedly recommend a controller with analog capability not just a digital d-pad thing, as it'll be almost required to do well here.  The keyboard can be very unforgiving, but not so much so that, within an hour or two of play, that I had any trouble getting the Porsche 911 *cough* COMET *cough* around the countryside (NOT A TRACK, REAL ROADS) without an issue at top speed.  The cars handle with fairly adequete realism and also are rather forgiving when going a little 'too fast'.  There is a bit of variety here also, including desert, beaches, mountains, snow, highways (2, 4, and 6 lane highways divided and nondivided) and red-wood forest.  A few real-life vehicles are also added in for AI traffic on top of the real vehicles already present in this game for racing.  Damage is superficial and arcade-ey in nature & as such, you won't be bending your car in half.  Damage is shown by marred body panels and broken lights, and your head lights will randomly cut out while driving at night.  A bad enough head-on-collision or contact with the barrier going fast enough will show a cut-scene of your 'wonderful' ability on the road, and set you back several seconds of racing, though it is not an impossibly long time that you cannot catch up (usually).  If you are looking for a well-polished racer for SINGLEPLAYER racing, this is the game for you.  If you are looking for multiplayer, you'll have to look only to EA's newest offering as multiplayer only lives about 2-3 years AT MOST on EA's newest titles.  This is one of the serious, most deal-breaking cons there is to this game, is that EA's servers are required by the game to do multiplayer (you must log in to save).  I shouldn't have a gimped product so soon after release, especially with these financially hard times today, and that goes for anyone who buys most of their games from the bargain bin like I do.  Let us atleast host/join user-servers after you shut the official ones down.  Don't MAKE me log into ANYTHING (I don't care about cloud-saving, it's a GAME, not my job!) to play singleplayer and save.  I LOATHED GTA IV for this aspect and actually had to mod THAT game to let me save without logging in (even though I purchased it more than once for myself legally) simply because it was an annoyance.\nI could go on for hours, but don't let the ranting bit fool you, it's still a fun and well-polished game.  Don't hate me if it becomes obvious that there are flaws and programming gimmicks in this game, however, with the AI always keeping up and the autolog fahl-dee-rahl.  Still way better than Rockstar games DRM-hassled lousy console-ported GTAIV/EFLC with all it's login-required-rubbish.  It's a game, I don't want to have to LOG IN, might as well just say 'anything you do in this game can be used against you in the court of law', to all the customers.\nI will make it a point, that if you just want to race a Porsche or other supercar around the roads, it allows you to do so without logging in though you'd have to unlock other cars 1st.  That is about all I can do on mine here, as the game is just too hard with my PTSD to get into most times.\n\nPros:\nHours of Arcade Racing fun!\nFancy GFX\nFancy SFX\nAlways stays fairly challenging no matter what your skill level.\nReal Road Racing, not closed, unrealistic tracks.\n\nCons:\nNo real damage, if that's what you're into.\nOpponents scripted to always keep up, they're always right behind you no matter what (that's a game-breaker for me).\nFor me this ruins racing, as it also takes away your sense of accomplishment (until the race is over if you win).\nMenu can be confusing to some or takes atleast some getting used to, and AUTOLOG, or any LOG INs outside of multiplayer is irritating and invasive as a means of copy-protection masquerading as a feature.  Leave this OUT, EA.\nUnskippable cut scenes, that's a pain.  DON'T EVER FORCE CUT SCENES, that just sucks.\nOpponents use boost ALL the time, or atleast on a consistent basis.  What if I want to disable BOOSTING on my game, what, I can't shut that off or toggle it out for my game session?\nMusic is OK if you're a teenager.  I am not into that type of music, nor is anyone that I know.  Where'd they find this stuff anyways?  Any way would could stream a few real-stations in-game (without using our own media player in this OS)?  I am sure some stations would like that publicity/promotion.\n\nGood game not free of caveats, still recommend if you like EA's products, just know what you are in for, that is all.\nReal opponents next time, EA.

Once upon a time NFS involved a bit of acrade-style racing that was fun.  These cars handle more like hovercraft:  If you see it, you WILL hit it.  They decided to add the popular 'it takes time to turn your steering wheel' mechanic, which, let's face it:  Is completely bonkers for a decent racing game.\nI only played the police side of it, so maybe the actual 'racing' part is better, but...  I doubt it.  The physics just don't seem to support the ability to actually turn without 'drifing'.  Even at speeds greater than 150 in cars that are built to add down-force, the game designers seemed to think that drifting will still make you turn better.\n\nIn other words, the game tries too hard to be 'realistic' with it's steering/physics system while ignoring the effects of downforce on cornering, to the point that it becomes pointless to play.  Then they added a drifting mechanic to try to make up for it, which is completely unrealistic.","January 4, 2015","false","6.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","3"

Still way better than Rockstar games DRM-hassled lousy console-ported GTAIV/EFLC with all it's login-required-rubbish.  It's a game, I don't want to have to LOG IN, might as well just say 'anything you do in this game can be used against you in the court of law', to all the customers.\nI will make it a point, that if you just want to race a Porsche or other supercar around the roads, it allows you to do so without logging in though you'd have to unlock other cars 1st.  That is about all I can do on mine here, as the game is just too hard with my PTSD to get into most times.\n\nPros:\nHours of Arcade Racing fun!\nFancy GFX\nFancy SFX\nAlways stays fairly challenging no matter what your skill level.\nReal Road Racing, not closed, unrealistic tracks.\n\nCons:\nNo real damage, if that's what you're into.\nOpponents scripted to always keep up, they're always right behind you no matter what (that's a game-breaker for me).\nFor me this ruins racing, as it also takes away your sense of accomplishment (until the race is over if you win).\nMenu can be confusing to some or takes atleast some getting used to, and AUTOLOG, or any LOG INs outside of multiplayer is irritating and invasive as a means of copy-protection masquerading as a feature.  Leave this OUT, EA.\nUnskippable cut scenes, that's a pain.  DON'T EVER FORCE CUT SCENES, that just sucks.\nOpponents use boost ALL the time, or atleast on a consistent basis.  What if I want to disable BOOSTING on my game, what, I can't shut that off or toggle it out for my game session?\nMusic is OK if you're a teenager.  I am not into that type of music, nor is anyone that I know.  Where'd they find this stuff anyways?  Any way would could stream a few real-stations in-game (without using our own media player in this OS)?  I am sure some stations would like that publicity/promotion.\n\nGood game not free of caveats, still recommend if you like EA's products, just know what you are in for, that is all.\nReal opponents next time, EA.  This was a game-breaking thing for myself but that's just me.","December 31, 2014","true","3.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I hadn't played a racing game in quite a while beforehand.\n.. and I was disappointed. I remember playing Hot Pursuit 2 in the past on the Gamecube? or some console around that time and it was pretty cool.. it had good visuals for its time, an awesome soundtrack, fun levels, and a great car selection complete with the ability to freely set up tracks and play as you want alone or with friends. That was a cool game.\n\nThis one isn't.\n\nVisually it looks good. The music is.. meh. The music is boring. The title or level select screens don't have that awesome upbeat style the older Hot Pursuit games did. Its so dark and boring.\n\nThe actual levels have a limited selection of vehicles of choice. The sense of speed is pretty good, but the levels are very very basic. Despite being a more arcadey game, it kind of felt like you should just play a racing simulator instead.\nIts like, a weird in-between of arcadey awesome and simulation and fails to deliver on either.\nThere are some more arcadey game modes where you drop spike traps and things like that and they're just boring. Being chased by cops is dull.\n\nThe whole game is incredibly bland. Oh, and there isn't even a free-play mode where you choose a level and any car you\nwant + other settings like cops on or off, difficulty, and a bunch of other things the old NFS games had.\nYeah, that doesn't exist at all.

It is passably disrespectful that they would even dare remaking the Hot Pursuit series, but to put that title on THIS?? Unacceptable.\n\nHere's why it sucks:\n-Every car is exactly the same in every area except looks and speed: no handling stat, acceleration, etc.\n-There is no depth: Career mode is a series of repetitive races, time trials, and attempting to "bust" speeders as a underwhelming, though superpowered, cop\n-Cars do not move: all of the cars have the same handling and that handling sucks. Since when was NEED FOR SPEED supposed to have even remotely realistic handling?? Also, taking down cars is 5x harder in this game than in real life. As a die-hard Burnout fan, and classic NFS fan, this game's physics actually sadden me. You can ram a car with all your might and you will get the same result as if you tried to ram a running train 12x heavier than you. The cops somehow are able to magically decimate your car though.\n-THERE IS NOTHING TO DO: like I said, there are races, cops-and-robbers craps, and a buttload of time trial/"Preview" bullcrap. It is not fun. I swear this game was made by people who do not play video games. Sure, there's free-roam driving but the world around you sucks. There are sparse bits of nearly invincible traffic, and the game just feels lonely 24/7.\n-It's not Need For Speed anymore: I know a lot of people actually liked this game and ramble on about how it may actually be just as good or better than classic Need For Speeds, but I would ask you this: what the crap kinda bootleg "Need For Speed" did yall used to play???\n-It's not Burnout: Back in the Gamecube/PS2 era, Burnout and Need For Speed were the two best unrealistic racing series in existence, in my opinion. They were actually rival series and they were both great at different things and equally enjoyable and worth playing. That was then, now it is no longer the case and it's sad. I would say Burnout Paradise is the best racing game I have played, maybe ever; I can't help but compare any racing game I play now to Burnout Paradise. Unfair, I know, but that's how it is. But Burnout Paradise withstanding, I am greatly disappointed by this game. And bored.\n\n...At least the in-game cars look nice.\n\n\n","May 12, 2014","false","2.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sgtpieman/recommended/47870/","sgtpieman","Bandana Dee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sgtpieman/","59 products in account","When I was a wee little kid one of my first racing games was Need for Speed 3: Hot Pursuit. It was fun. The way the title was written I always thought it was Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 3, and so I wondered why Hot Pursuit 2 was better in every way, but it was fun. Then I got Hot Pursuit 2 on PC AND PS2 because it was that freaking good. I played the crap out of that game, and it was always fun to return home from school to race while avoiding the police.\n\nWhat seperates Hot Pursuit from other racing games? The cops. In Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, not only are you racing other cars, but you also have to worry about the police who will do everything in their power to shut the race down. This includes slamming your car all over the road, pinning it into corners, setting up roadblocks ahead, dropping spikestrips to flatten your tires, and calling a helicopter to find ways to ensure that even in the air they can ruin your day. It's not just a racing game, but an action survival game as you wreck cop cars and escape from the police like it's Fast and Furious. Which like the movies, Need for Speed is all about the rule of cool trope. Why is that cop chasing you in a Lamborghini? Because it's awesome, that's why.\n\nAt the time this game came out I thought Need for Speed was a dead franchise. I had no idea this game and others existed. I only recently found out about this some months ago, and waited for a sale to pick this up. Now I was hesitant to get this reboot of the series considering what happened when Red Alert 3 was made (to make a long story short, it wasn't very good, and Red Alert 2 was one of my favorite games from my childhood as well), so I came in with low expectations. But holy cow was I ever surprised that they didn't mess this game up.\n\nIt's still Hot Pursuit. But, it's Hot Pursuit on crack! Let me go over some of the differences between Hot Pursuit 2 and this game.\n\n1) In Hot Pursuit 2, the police had no way to bust you other than to be within a certain distance for a certain amount of time while you are below a certain speed. Once they do this three times, you're out of the race. In this reboot, rather than having strikes you have a health bar. All the cops (as well as other racers, pedestrians, and the enviroment) have to do is destroy your car. Granted your health is fairly beefy, but it IS possible to take down to zero, and in later parts of the game this happened quite frequently. This is a welcome change as it makes good driving skills much more important, as well as easing the OP'ness of the racers.\n2) In Hot Pursuit 2, spikestrips were static. A cop would request permission to place it, get approved, and then one would spawn ahead in a set location. The police would then announce on the radio where it was and what side of the road it was on. It was essentially a less visible roadblock. In Hot Pursuit 2010 the racers AND police have spikestrips, and they are deployables. When playing offline, I never noticed other racers using spikestrips, but that was fine by me as the police did more than fill that gap. What a cop will do is drive ahead of you, pull out in front, and then drop a strip. So if you see a cop pass you by, try to get as far away from the back of his car as possible. This makes spikestrips much more interesting as they can be anywhere at anytime, and you have to be able to adapt. It's never impossible to dodge them, but it does get trickier as you progress, because all "gadgets" have upgrades. So that means a cop may drop multiple strips.\n3) Gadgets. Hot Pursuit 2 had you and the cars. This game, as you play and unlock them, has upgradable gadgets and a "nitro" system. At first I thought it was completely unneccesary, but they sure do make things a lot more interesting. Especially in the longer courses. You have a nitro that fills up as you do risky stuff. Using the nitro will give you a burst of speed as long as you have the nitro to do it. You have a turbo that's nitro on crack, though it doesn't have a bar. You have a set number of uses, it makes you go extremely fast, and its length is out of your control. You'll be stuck in turbo until it's over. EMP allows police and racers to disable your car for a second. As you improve in the game you'll be able to jam EMP, dodge the lock-on, and correct your car while it's trying to spin out so that little-to-no-damage is done. So there's a degree of skill and conserving resources. I mentioned how you can drop spike strips already. Finally there's the jammer, which will block EMPs and allow you to see incoming roadblocks.\n4) The courses in Hot Pursuit 2 were seperate tracks with laps, like in every other racing game. In this reboot, you have a world map, but unlike Burnout Paradise where you never know where to go unless you painstakenly memorize EVERYTHING, the courses will be constructed for you out of this map. Also, instead of laps, you have a start and end point. This means that during a race you won't be seeing the same sights over and over again as you do laps. It keeps the race feeling fresh each time, with any degree of recognition being from an alternate route you took in another race.\n5) Takedowns and crashes. In Hot Pursuit 2, if you hit a wall or another car, then you just stop, reverse, and continue going. Here though it's like my two favorite racing games (Burnout 3 and NFS: Hot Pursuit 2) had a love child. If you've played Burnout, then you know what happens when you crash into something. Your car gets wrecked, massive damage is taken from your health, and you're put back on the road ready to go. But by then the other racers are past you. As with point number 1, this encourages better driving. It also makes races without cops much more exciting. In old Need for Speed, I could never understood why people would play with the cops turned off. It's just a run of the mill racing game then. But now, it becomes classic Burnout, and that's not a bad thing. I wasn't a fan of Paradise City, so something more like the older games where I could focus on racing rather than opening the map screen every couple of seconds to check where I should turn is more than welcome.\n\nNow I see in other reviews there are unskippable cutscenes. I have no idea what they are talking about. I skip them all the time. The only unskippable thing that occurs is the brief (like, 1-2 seconds maximum) scenes where it introduces a new cop car coming for you that you haven't seen before in previous races, when you total another racer or cop, or when your EMP/Spike Strip hits someone. Which, once again, is very brief. And Hot Pursuit 2 had the same thing. In fact, it was worse in HP2 because you would lose control of your car and there was no redirection. So if you were coming up to a turn or about to hit a strip or something and a camera snippit was shown, then you'd hit what was in front of you, no questions asked. At least here the game will steer your car for you while this is happening. And it does a great job at that too. Making turns better than I could, avoiding cars and police blockades and stuff by itself, etc. It has never screwed me over to give up control for 2 seconds, unlike in Hot Pursuit 2.\n\nNow, what complaints do I have? The soundtrack isn't as good as HP2, but with Steam Music I fixed that problem easily. That thing works great for racing games.\n\nThe only other thing I find dissapointing is that there is no custom race mode. I can't create a path or even pick one to race on how I want. I can't pick a path, set whether I want cops to be there or not, set gadgets on or off (a lot of races don't even have the gadgets, but most of the ones with the cops chasing you do), set time of day, etc. I have to pick from premade "events", and level up my bounty (which isn't hard at all. Very anti-grindy actually. But it's still there) to unlock the events that I want to do. A custom race mode would have made this perfect.\n\nOtherwise, solid 8/10.","January 16","true","22.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's extremely easy\nto pick up, and easy to put down. It's great for what it is, but I feel like paying $20 is a bit too much. If you find it for $5,\nit's well worth the price.

If you liked NFSIII you will not like this game. It combines the Gamecube/PC NFSV pursuit mechanics with Criterion's patent pending virtual oil and road layout of NFS carbon for a really weird but strangely addicting experience. Another note is that this game requires a controller, period. Its steering wheel's "accelleration" is impossible to control with the keyboard and just flat out doesn't work with two of the three SUPPORTED wheels that I tried.\n\nThe game also has Carbon's autoguided scene/jump camera system, except its AI doesn't keep pace with other cars. I don't know whether this is an oversight or intentional.\n\nHowever, if you aren't a sim buff and can let this game's sins slide, what's left is a tight series of challenges that feel plucked straight from a late nineties cabinet, pitfalls and all. Despite all my reservations with it, learning the various silly weapons and when to fire them (in order to minimize the autoguided scene camera car slowdown), learning how to drift, and learning how to smash things in the silliest of ways is quite a bit of fun.

HDR, wet roads, lights, rain all look impressive and realistic. crashes are spectacular, and the damage to the car actually makes at least some sense (the awkwardness of car damage is just about the only thing i dislike about NFS HP2).\n\nthe concept of the game is where it's at for classic racing games - no "story", no "progression", no "customization", simple "win this race to unlock more tracks/cars". this may seem boring to a lot of younger NFS fans who grew up with NFS:U, but this is what actually makes a great classic racing game. and this is what drew me in to this game in the first place, as i have given up hope on NFS ever returning to their roots of joyriding on supercars, with none of that "illegal racing" shtick.\n\n(to be fair, most pre-NFS:U games had cops, and the fact that they were chasing you meant that technically, the racing was illegal as well. the difference is, you didn't feel like being an actual criminal, being in a gang or a "racing crew" and all that; it just felt like racing scenic routes, but with cops on your tail as a nuisance)\n\ntechnically speaking, execution is flawless - i didn't notice any glitches or bugs, game runs smoothly on highest settings, the controls are pretty responsive (more on that later). so nothing to complain on this front either.\n\ngood parts end here, and what follows is all bad parts.\n\nfirst of all, soundtrack. i'm more of a classic rock fan, but even through NFS HP2 didn't have any of that, it still had a cool adrenaline-infusing, loud and fast rock soundtrack. at least it lent itself well to driving fast while listening to it. none of that here - music in this game makes me want to sleep, not drive. and to top it off, there is absolutely no way of changing the music, so you have to resort to running a music player in the background. this was an extremely stupid move by EA - i understand that everyone's tastes are different, but can we at least have custom music in-game without resorting to workarounds?\n\nnext thing, physics. it sucks. it feels completely console-y and arcade-y. and in a bad way. NFS never was a driving simulator, but this is way too far. use handbrake, the car just turns 90 degrees, and you're good to go, the car is perfectly stable again, as if it didn't just go forward at 250+ km/h. that's not what happens in real life, you know. it's called inertia, look it up. and because of that, every car essentially drives the same - there's not much difference between a BMW and a Lamborghini, aside from speed. hit gas, hit handbrake once in a while, hit nitro on long straights. done. no personality to cars whatsoever.\n\naside from that, the braindead NFS Underground et al game mechanics are present here as well, albeit to the lesser extent. you still have nitro, so the game is now down to not "who drives better", but "who knows how to use nitro better". at least in NFS:U you had to *buy* nitro, and could only use it once in the race. nitro as it is in this game makes no sense whatsoever.\n\nalso, courtesy of NFS:U, you still have "drifting" as well. why?! it's a flashy gimmick! drifting kills your tires, not one proper racer in their right mind would intentionally drift that much on tarmac! but here, not only it's a game mechanic (as opposed to simply being a natural consequence of the game's physics, like in NFS 6), it's actually encouraged.\n\nyou'd think that at least the cops pursuits would be great, right? being all "back to the roots" and stuff. but no, cop chases have their fair share of stupidity as well. first of all, the "takedowns". i get it, it looks flashy when you barely scratch a rival's (or cop's) car and it suddenly goes spinning into the side of the road for some reason, but why does this only happen in cop chases? what, laws of physics suddenly change when cops are on the road? try doing a takedown in a regular race - no luck, you'd just hit a rival's car and lose speed.\n\nnot only that, but why do i have weapons? i am getting away from cops, yet *i* can spike them? i mean, i'm all for role reversal if the partner is willing, but this is too far into the Rollcage territory. this is the stupidest idea i've seen so far in an NFS game.\n\nthere are other various little bits that are annoying and stupid as well: the constant camera shifting, which is very pace-breaking; the inability to do custom single races and time trials; the stupid commentary that can't be skipped over; this newfangled "online" "social" thingie that nags you every time; the AI magically catching up to you when you're driving at max speed on a long straight...\n\nand the most stupid part: you can't actually get arrested by cops. you drive at 300 km/h, you hit a cop roadblock, you spin away, stop on your roof... and then you happily respawn and drive away again, like nothing ever happened! like you didn't just STOP, surrounded by a bunch of cops, which would've got you arrested in a second if it was NFS:HP2! but no, in order to actually be caught, apparently you have to destroy your car. that's beyond stupid. that destroys the whole purpose of the races with cops.\n\nfinally, the whole "open world" thing. an "open world" basically means "one big track". and while the scenery can be varied, it can't be compared to the joy of driving around different countries, different continents and different cultures. i don't want to drive around a single US state which, for some reason, comprises just a bunch of highways, i want to visit many different places! you've got this beautiful graphics engine, and you're wasting it all away on one single scenery!\n\nso, in conclusion, IMHO NFS:HP2 still remains the undisputed king of classic NFS series. it strikes just the right balance of not being too old (and thus having blocky graphics and wonky physics) and having all the classic gameplay elements of a proper racing game - long varied tracks with beautiful scenery, great cars, and cops. this game fails to dethrone it. it may be a step in the right direction... but no cigar, not by a mile.","June 2","false","8.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elbotijo/recommended/47870/","elbotijo","El Botijo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elbotijo/","400 products in account","The main issue I have with this game is that it is focused on on-line gaming. I suppose that the game was alright durign the few months after its launch at end of 2010. There are not so many players around 2014, I am afraid. The game makes matchmaking even more difficult than what it should: you need to chose between game type and car type before you enter a lobby. There is no indication how lively online gaming is, although I have been able to play a single game. On a saturday afternoon.\n\nAs far as the single player campaing go, the game is somewhat boring. I played the game with an XBox360 pad and I can tell you I have not let the throttle go. It is an arcade racer. You start with already fast cars, taking many bends at 200 kmh, and cars only get faster, or harder to control. That means that many bends are wide enough, so the challenges end up being the off-road sections. It looks like there is some sort of mechanism to correct your direction too.\n\nCampaign setup is devoid of interesting things to do. You play both a lifeless policeman and a lifeless racer, with only a mention that police forces try to stop the racers at Seacrest County. There is no story of any sort, not even the dumbest story you could think of (a la NfS: Underground 2). The reward system also gets into my nerves, as almost any race you run is followed by a 20 to 60 second slideshow showing you your rewards. Rewards that you do not care because there are so many of them, and many are just the ones that you forget of next race. I have been driving a new car each race.\n\nOn the technical side, I would have expected some sort of antialiasing in the game. The game is OK by being a port from Xbox360/PS3, with graphics matching what you can do on the consoles. That means, graphics show its age if you know where you are looking for.\n\nGame requires an Origin account for its online component. The original Autolog website is gone, replaced by a NFS:Rivals only website. I wonder how much life is left for this game, as EA is notorious of turning off the multiplayer servers after a while.\n\nSo, if you get some friends playing this game, you might enjoy far way better than a solo player than me.","August 3, 2014","false","4.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

(i mean really the siren doesnt do anything npc civillian cars are competely ignoring it and even FREAKINGLY HONKING when you get near them, ITS YOUR OWN FAULT IF YOU GET HIT STUPID NPCS YOU SHOULD MOOOOOOVVVEEE!! out of the way!! i hope its not really like this is USA cause then i can understand cops get nowhere..)\n- COPS: whenever you enter a bust an racer race you enter with like 2 -3 vehicles as support wish magicaly vanish whenever you finally get control of your car and reappear when victorious (beside potentially haven crappy ai they would have come really handy whenever one of them racers decide to simple turn around in them middle of freaking chase, which now somehow is one of the smartest things they can do..)\n- Time trails (always hated them, guess there must be people that love them or something apparently cant have a race game without them)\n- .. will update as i continue playing\n\nPROS:\n- cops and robbers powerups (kinda cool mario kart style weaponry although, barely allowed, use only sometimes and in few numbers. But they lvlup and become more powerful was a nice suprise)\n\nso in short:\n- as a cop you'll be screaming alot gtf out of my way, its your own fault!","October 16, 2015","false","6.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The steering sensitivity and deadzone are way off and it takes ages for the car to react to your input. There are no options to change this.

Would still much prefer a wheel and pedal setup that doesn't require much hassle for me and the ability to use a manual but it's still fun this way. A bit too simple for my usual tastes but it'll be fun on lazy evenings or with company over.\n\nWorst game I've bought in many years. Admittedly I messed up and did not do my research (saw it on a good sale) but it still doesn't excuse the fact that this game is horrible especially if you have a wheel and pedal setup. You can not calibrate the controls. You can not get a cockpit view. You can not use a manual transmission. W. T. F. F. is this BS in a NFS game? I'd love a refund but I can't get one. Oh, and the graphics are pitiful for a 2010 release. Obviously ported from a less-than-worthy console and they took zero time to fix up the graphics. Even with everything turned up it looks more like a 2003-2005 era release. Pathetic. Keep your money unless you just have to have every NFS title. I recommend Shift over this by far.

And the best part is you don't have to be neccessary a cop to have those\n\nSure there is a difference between controller and a keyboard but that won't be a problem for the regular PC gamer - after couple of tracks you'll get used to it and beating a player with controller won't be a problem for you.\n\nAlso Awesome Soundtrack!\n\nI definitely recommend buying this game whether is on sale or not.

Luckily I bought it during a Steam Sale. I've finished the game in a less than 10 hours (probably even a hour or 2 less as I go AFK mid-games sometimes) without any struggling, and I'm not a professional when it comes to racing games. But most importantly: there is no reason to come back and play it again at all after completing the ''campaign''. After finishing the campaign, you unlock every car automatically and there is nothing else you can work towards to (there even aren't any Steam achievements). There is an option to play online against other players, but there aren't enough (if any) other players for this game anymore and therefore the racing against others online option is dead. You can queue for an online game, wait a hour, and still find out that none else will join it. You can also compare your racing-times with other players, but only with friends who also happen to play the game. How ridiculous is that?! You also can't customize the easily-earned cars, except for picking a new full-body color for only some cars, unlike other games in the NFS-series including NFS: Undercover. As for the positive factors, that would mostly be the graphics and crash-scenes. I wouldn't ever buy this game for over € 5,-. Even for a € 5,- price-tag I'd still have my thoughts whether it's worth it. Anyway, here is my list of pros and cons with a bit of extra stuff in it.\n\nPros:\n- Great graphics\n- Great crashing-scenes\n- Great police-chases and escapes (helicopter interceptions, barricades, awesome!)\n- You can destroy other cars (so can yours be)\n- Easily learnt how to play it\n\nCons:\n- Every. single. car. is automatically and easily earned by finishing the not-challenging-at-all campaign (only the final 2 missions are a bit challenging, though still easy)\n- No customization options (only some cars can get a different full-body paint-job, that's all.) (There also isn't even a single customization option for the police cars)\n- There is a leveling system which has no purpose at all. I think it's only there to make you feel like you still earned something after losing a race (which you will rarely lose). The leveling system offers you slightly upgraded (and no different) weapons for your car. You will earn those ''upgraded'' weapons automatically during the campaign anyway.\n- Racing-routes are getting used over and over during the campaign, not once, not twice, no, sometimes you're driving the same road for up to like 8 different missions.\n- Racing-routes all look somewhat the same. No special jumps or whatsoever. Just one route has more curves than the others.\n- You play as two different roles during the entire game. Sometimes as the police officer, sometimes as the wanted person. But both roles earn the exact same car, except that you get sirens when being the police officer. Worst of all, because of that, you earn every single car in the game twice. So you've finished a mission, and what is your reward? ''Oh hey, it's the Lamborghini again which I've won earlier in this campaign as well, just this time with sirens on its roof''.\n- Sometimes the weather changes into a thunderstorm, but the amount of lightning during the thunderstorms is ridiculous. Lightning flashes every second. (awful if you're seizure-sensitive)\n- The online community is completely dead. Barely anyone plays the game online, sometimes you can sit in a queue (room) for up a to a hour and still not see any other player.\n- There is also no reason to play online, it does not earn you anything and you can't compare your stats with other online players. You can only compare your stats with friends.\n- There is nothing else to work towards to after finishing the campaign, there even aren't any Steam achievements, and there is no point in trying to set a better racing-time as you can't compare the stats online.\n- The physics are different (awful?) compared to the other NFS titles. You will (almost) never get off the ground with your car, no matter how big the bump in the road is. There are 2 or 3 bumps in the entire game (which you can even skip) which gets you only slightly off the ground, but you won't even notice that if you blinked. Steering also works awful compared to the other NFS titles. If you steer for a millisecond and tap the brake for a millisecond, you can get through any curve and you can perform a burn-out for the rest of the race. The only way to get out of the burnout is by driving 99% straight forward. If you're steering even slightly (10%) left or right, you'll stay in a burnout.\n- When you crash, you actually don't crash. A cut-scene with a crash pops up whenever you hit something else hard enough, and once the cut-scene ends you're just somehow driving at full speed and perfectly straight on the road.\n- Campaign is very repetitive. You'll barely notice any difference between the first mission, the final mission and everything in between.\n- Every mission uses the exact same cut-scene, both at the start and in the end.\n- (small con) When you start up the game, you have to sit through some of the credits and wait for them to pass by; you can't skip them.\n- You can abuse bugs by crashing your car at certain moments. For example, if there is a roadblock up ahead, you can 1 mile beforehand hit the guardrail to trigger a crashing cut-scene; the crashing cut-scene lets you completely bypass the roadblock.\n- The game can be finished within a few hours, even if you're entirely new to racing games. There is no reason to come back unless you'd like to start the campaign over again\n\nOut of 10, I'd rate it 5,5. The awesome police-chases and escapes is what compensates it just enough to be able to say that ''it's an ok game''. But I'm excluding the price for that rating. If I'd include the price, I'd definitely not recommend it to others. The amount of hours you can/will spend on this game simply isn't worth € 15,-. It'd be € 5,- max. But if you ''just want to try'' this game out, I wouldn't even pay € 5,-. Do it if you're a NFS-fan who's truly interested or otherwise get any of the other (even older) NFS titles. And if you really want police-chases, get the older, better, and cheaper NFS Undercover instead.","January 19, 2015","false","16.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

One of the many reasons I've stopped looking at future purchases from your company.\n\nGameplay: Was less of an open world than I world than I would have liked, but was ok for the amount of time I could play it.\n\nGraphics: were pretty, they're probably better on my new card though... but I'll never know.","November 14, 2015","false","36.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

No manual transmission, only control over your car that you have is steering and braking. Thats it.\n\nUser Interface: The menu system is built like an old arcade game style or console style. No mouse. Makes it annoying to scroll through lists like your controls, which half the time break if you accidentally bind two things to the same key. Another thing is that you have to be connected to the internet for your progress to be saved, and if you reinstall the game your progress isnt even linked to your account, so you have to start over from scratch (lost ~20 hours of gameplay).\n\nMusic: Rather short playlist and starts to get repetitive about 2 hours into the game. I just turn it off and play music from youtube.\n\nMultiplayer: Dead. Dont buy this game just to play with your friends since it will only be you and your pals in the whole server system.\n\n\nOverall rating: 3/10. Dont buy this game, Dont fund EA, even if this game is on sale. Youl have more fun with other racing sims.","December 5, 2015","false","22.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

For ex:\n\n>the cop cars & helicopter suck..\n\n>you can be 200mph in a lambo on a twisty back road or straight away... drifing and tearing it up.. holding in your nitrus the whole time until it empties: Doesn't matter. You can't outrun cops or other cars you are racing. They are alway in your rear view. No matter what. Its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. There's almost no point in using a nitrus aside from a time trial, cause in an actual race, it really doesn't give you any advantage. Its not like the old need for speed where you could master the course and end up a full lap ahead of another racer. Here, there is always a racer or cop like a second or two behind you.\n\n>The physics are kinda meh. The cars handle really mushy. So as a result, you are forced constantly into a drift around it seems every corner. Like every corner, even little ones.\n\n>no option for automatic/manual. Its all automatic.\n\n>the time trials are a joke. Like cut way too close.  You can't go to the next map until you finish the first a lot of times, and I have to redo a time trial map over & over & over cause I miss a half a second or a 10th of a second on a map that takes overall 5 or 6 minutes.\n\n>the cops suck\n\n>You can't scip cutscenes. Why? Most of them aren't really all that important anyway.\n\n>A lot of the corses are related to evading cops or being the cops, so if you don't like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about a cop in a regular cop sedan drifing 200mph perfectly through backroads 2" from your bumper, then you probably wont like this.\n\n>the cops are super unrealistic, cant be outrun in their piece of ♥♥♥♥ cars even at 220mmp with your turbo button held down.. they still fly past you. Bull ♥♥♥♥.\n\n>Did I mention the unrealistic cops suck and ruin the game?\n\nI dunno, its fun as a driving game and I'm not done with it. But its more frusterating than it is rewarding. Makes you feel like you are working really hard for nothing a lot of the time the way they did things.","December 7, 2015","false","11.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Vortex","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197960390309/","126 products in account","Overall this game fails due to the cheating rubber band AI. Why have faster cars when the AI will cheat and fly past you with a slower car? Despite all the cheating to AI fails to provide much of a challenge. Sometimes the AI will even get so high speed boost into a corner, that they have no chance of making the turn and instead wall ride / bounce of the walls to make the turn.\n\nSome of the negative things I faced in this game:\n\nThe way takedowns of opponents and cops can cause some really annoying and confusing situations. Sometimes I'd bust racers as a cop, when after a previous cutscene spawned me directly on a crash course with another racer. Coming out of a crash cutscene can also cause you to be heading towards a wall with almost no time to recover. The way these crashes get triggered also seems quite random at times. Sometimes you'll be crashing with traffic almost head on at 200km/h only to have your speed reduced. Other times hitting something at much lower speed will trigger a crash.\n\nTaking down cops as a racer also seems to be quite pointless. In many cases the game will simply spawn more and more cops to chase you, thus turning the takedowns into nothing more but some extra points for advancing your rank.\n\nThe handling differences of the cars within a certain series are basically nonexistent. Sure, this isn't meant to be a simulation, but it would be nice if your car selection would have any impact on the handling at all. Now they all feel basically the same.\n\nI also randomly experienced some odd performance slowdowns  that fixed themselves after a couple of seconds.\n\nPositive things about the game:\n\nUnlike many other modern NFS games, this does actually have a bonnet  camera. Thus you aren't forced to use the back camera like in many other games in the series. Yes, those games do have the bumper camera, but I consider that to be useless as it's so low that you cannot see anything even if there's a slighthest hill on the road.\n\nYou can turn of the damn siren, even during a chase event. There's no point in having it on IMHO since it has no effect on the traffic anyway. For example some events in Rivals force you to have the siren on.\n\nThe soundtrack is decent enough. It does have some really good tracks like Watercolour by Pendulum.\n\nThere aren't long unskippable cutscenes, I wish though that those that are in the game could be skipped.","April 19","false","13.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Until now. Hot Pursuit was really promising, since the last NFS I played was the first Most Wanted. Now you could play as cops as well, which sounded to me that this game would be everything Most Wanted was and more. Sadly, that's not true.\nThe first thing that really bugged me was the whole online-registration thing. My friends don't play this game and I don't want to be forced to be able to use the online-functions. After that you jump right into the game. You choose an event, you race it and so on. Your first car is already a Porsche, you can choose it's color and that's it. Thorughout the first 2 hours of this game you have already unlocked so many cars, it's almost ridiculous. There's no "career mode", where you save up to buy a car or to tune your car the way you want it. You just get the cars. And what's the point of taking pictures of your car and sharing them with your friends when you can't make your car look unique?\nIt's sad, the racing part is actually quite fun but without the whole "open world", career-thing that makes you value your cars, it just feels like a series of test-drives, since I really don't see how you would do 2 races in a row with the same car, when you unlock a new car every race.\nI know that you will actually pick your cars carefully later on in the game, it's just that it's more fun imo to have those few cars you bought and specialized to chose from rather than every car that's in the game.\nI really did expect a lot more from this game and I can't see why they left out the whole car-specializing and open world part. The best thing in Most Wanted was, after finishing a race being chased by cops, that you would have to lose the heat even after the race. Now it just stops when you cross the finish line. Sad.\n\nEdit: Of course it feautres the EA-exklusive unskippable "cutscenes" and player unfriendly gameplay mechanics as well as the ridiculously overdriven sound "effects". But hey, at a Lamborghini exklusive event you can choose between 3 almost identical Lamborghinis! That's something, right?\n\nEdit 2: I'm definitely done playing this game for good. I just had a race, where the last part is almost one long straight road, I escaped from a crash site where every other racer-car was standing still, I put on the turbo, continued with 400 km/h and powered the turbo again for the last few meters and suddenly two race-cars dash in front of me and I end up being 2nd. I don't know why but EA seems to be in charge of how a race should develop and result. There's no way another car would have been able to come even close to me when they all just had been in an accident.","July 27, 2014","false","12.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In my opinion, if you want a driving game that has no point (it really doesn't) and is about as fun to play as grinding your face into a brick wall. go ahead and purchase it. if you want a racing game that also allows you to enjoy yourself and has multiple other features, try every other racing game. Hell try saints row 3, the driving in it is a lot more fun and has explosions and has more than one button to steer your car ( it allows you to use the joy sticks that came with your controller to emulate a steering wheel..... unlike NFS...... don't forget, you have 2 button controls. drift and accelerate.","July 23, 2014","false","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Until now. Hot Pursuit was really promising, since the last NFS I played was the first Most Wanted. Now you could play as cops as well, which sounded to me that this game would be everything Most Wanted was and more. Sadly, that's not true.\nThe first thing that really bugged me was the whole online-registration thing. My friends don't play this game and I don't want to be forced to be able to use the online-functions. After that you jump right into the game. You choose an event, you race it and so on. Your first car is already a Porsche, you can choose it's color and that's it. Thorughout the first 2 hours of this game you have already unlocked so many cars, it's almost ridiculous. There's no "career mode", where you save up to buy a car or to tune your car the way you want it. You just get the cars. And what's the point of taking pictures of your car and sharing them with your friends when you can't make your car look unique?\nIt's sad, the racing part is actually quite fun but without the whole "open world", career-thing that makes you value your cars, it just feels like a series of test-drives, since I really don't see how you would do 2 races in a row with the same car, when you unlock a new car every race.\nI know that you will actually pick your cars carefully later on in the game, it's just that it's more fun imo to have those few cars you bought and specialized to chose from rather than every car that's in the game.\nI really did expect a lot more from this game and I can't see why they left out the whole car-specializing and open world part. The best thing in Most Wanted was, after finishing a race being chased by cops, that you would have to lose the heat even after the race. Now it just stops when you cross the finish line. Sad.\n\nEdit: Of course it feautres the EA-exklusive unskippable "cutscenes" and player unfriendly gameplay mechanics as well as the ridiculously overdriven sound "effects". But hey, at a Lamborghini exklusive event you can choose between 3 almost identical Lamborghinis! That's something, right?\n\nEdit 2: I'm definitely done playing this game for good. I just had a race, where the last part is almost one long straight road, I escaped from a crash site where every other racer-car was standing still, I put on the turbo, continued with 400 km/h and powered the turbo again for the last few meters and suddenly two race-cars dash in front of me and I end up being 2nd. I don't know why but EA seems to be in charge of how a race should develop and result. There's no way another car would have been able to come even close to me when they all just had been in an accident.","July 27, 2014","false","12.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Thanks in large part to an over emphasis on driving as quickly as you can without any real motivation the game ends up feeling contrived and unsatisfying.\n\nAs a police interceptor the goal is to stop cars by wrecking them. If you manage to stop a car by pinning them to a mountain or wall for instance, then the car will simply respawn on the road and continue as normal. In races not as the police, ai cars don't rubberband, they warp.\n\nIf you don't have access to a gamepad, or preferably a steeringwheel accessory then I recomend you skip this title without a second thought. Keyboard controls are overly responsive without any ability to modulate the controls or their sensitivity making the game not an arcade racer, but more like a pinball simulator.\n\nIf you are pinning for the Need for Speed Hot Pursuit of the late 90's, give this title a pass. If, however, you just want a racer where you can take down cars and smash up the competition then give this title a pass, and go acquire Burnout Paradise. Despite the lack of support and the frankly irresponsible take down of the DLC store, it is still a far supperior title with far more replayability and far less repetition.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nGrand Turismo on Ice","December 26, 2014","false","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Criterion has done a great job (if not, a better job than EA) making this masterpiece. The game is very much back to its roots. It's much like the first generation of games in the franchise. The fact that Criterion was in charge in making this game proved that EA and/or Black Box are fond of making too much changes to the game, therefore dissapointing fans. Criterion knows well what the fans want.\n\nThe game may start a bit slow but as you progress throughout your career (as a racer or cop), it gets faster and better. It also gives you certain types of equipment to help cope with the sh** load of challenges in Career mode.\n\nI know this game is pretty old but it's still worth playing. Seriously, I was paranoid when I bought the game with the leftover $20 I had, anxious that it wouldn't be worth the 20 bucks. Need For Speed Hot Pursuit definitely proved me wrong.\n\nI made this recmmendation hoping that I'd get more friends to play the game. Single player isn't the only feature in this game and I'd love to try out more WITH friends.\n\nThanks for reading!\n","November 10, 2013","true","27.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I bought this game because I wanted a car racing game and I recalled the fun I had playing cops and running from them previously. This title doesn't deliver at all.\n\nNFS: Hot Pursuit has only one good thing about it - a variety of cars. But it doesn't matter as every car feels the same since this game has no proper physics at all. Cars stick to the road as if glued, you bounce from the walls like a ball and even the engine sound is average. The game has no soul, no emotion, getting a new car after every race is not exciting at all. Just boring.\n\nMaybe if you're into 100% arcade and don't expect much - you might like it. But if you're into cars and even slightly demanding races - stay away, or you'll be just as disappointed as I was.","April 16, 2015","false","6.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Why are there just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t menus to select cars for each repetitive "mission" along repetitive bits of road? Free roam seems almost redundant too. On top of all that, all of the cars drive exactly the same.

What sets an arcade racer apart from a game like Gran Turismo or Grid is that the control of the car is very unrealistic. Now, in previous games in the NFS canon that was not too bad. However, in this game, I honestly felt like the game was driving for me. At points you simply hit the break button once before a turn and the game takes over driving for the rest of the turn. Also, the stats that are assigned to each car regarding their top speed and zero to sixty time mean next to nothing regarding how the car will function in the game. You can continually put the cars which are faster than other cars up against each other, and the computer will just pull its ahead so that it can give the illusion of compeitition. Top speeds mean nothing because the nitrous feature eradicates whatever top speed you had. Also, the camera is constantly ripped from your grasp when you crash, when you crash another car or when one of your traps hits another car. Thus, again the computer takes over driving and will just randomly stick you somewhere in the road when it ends the crash cut scene. This can be particularly frustrating when you wreck and your car spends in the air for a few seconds before coming to a stop and the game then just restarts you somewhere back in the pack. Those criticisms aside, this is one of the better racing games available on steam. The GRID games are agonizingly realistic and PC lacks the GT or Forza games. Still though, this game does not measure up to the classic NFS games such as Hot Pursuit 2 and Underground. This game feels more about just showing off graphics then actual gameplay.","September 28, 2015","true","9.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So I briefly looked up which one seemed to be well reviewed of the recent games and purchased it. That's the last time I ever make that mistake. How this game ever got an 86/100 Metacritic score I will never know. Where are the car mods? Why are there just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t menus to select cars for each repetitive "mission" along repetitive bits of road? Free roam seems almost redundant too. On top of all that, all of the cars drive exactly the same. I get that NFS is supposed to be sort of unrealistic, but drifting round every corner like it's Mario Kart gets so damn boring!\n\nMaybe this was my fault for not properly researching the game, but NFS seems to have lost everything that made it fun back in the days of Underground 2 and Most Wanted (the latter being one of my favourite games on PS2). Here's to hoping the new one brings it back.\n\n(Also, ♥♥♥♥ off EA for ruining another cherished title from my childhood.)","July 15, 2015","false","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I uninstalled it after 30 minutes of playing. I know I have 51 hours on this, and I can explain. I had played it a long time ago, and I re-installed it to try it out again, but it turned out that it suck. I don't know why I played it so much back then...\nThe problem I had with it was the steering, you have to jam the left or right key to actually turn, then, oops, you went to far! And you end up hitting the wall, so you try to get back on the road, but insted of doing so, you run into the opposite wall! And the game is already really hard in itself!\n\nI was expecting this to really fun, but insted I got this.\n\n3/10","December 21, 2015","false","51.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"
