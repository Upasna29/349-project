Nothing new invented here; there are far better and cheaper platformers out there.\n\nMy main issue was with the controls, they were imprecise to say the least. If you want to jump to the next platform you have to really exaggerate the motion to successfully make it. There is no room for quick reactions that can save you from dying. I just like to have complete control of my character; losing because the controls are wonky is an automatic ‘thumbs down’.\n\nI know the sequel has been Greenlit... but how? and why? Worth $0.99\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

Enemies lack any sense of threat or aggression; they just passively follow fixed patterns instead of actively trying to attack the player.  Music is amateurish and dull to the point of making The Demon Rush sound good by comparison.  All songs use the same riffs that you'll forget the moment you turn off the game.  Alt+tabbing causes the graphics to glitch out for the remainder of your play session.\n\nIt's like someone who hated the NES decided to make a shallow mockery of the system, though a more likely scenario is that this is just the dev's first project which he decided to sell for real money, reputation be damned.  Maybe one day he'll go on to make something good, but ♥♥♥♥♥daria Upgrade is not that thing.","December 14, 2015","false","5.0"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","18","29","0","0"

First level is fine, boss battle is fun, but in later levels things go down the toilet very fast.\n\nI've managed to go to the big flying robot boss (whatever that is or is supposed to be) and then just stopped playing. That level is insane.\n\nWhat's fun:\n- retro feeling\n- enemies\n- powerups\n- second character\n- game is dexterity based\n\nWhat's not fun:\n- instant death caltrops - if you touch them you die\n- turbo pidgeons (or whatever that birds are) - during some levels there are pidgeons travelling horizontally at random. That would not be a problem if those enemies were not so turbo fast. Imagine that you jump on some blocks very high and you need to perform some rather precise jumps. You jump and then turbo pidgeon hits you and boom, you fall down or into instant death caltrops. No fun here.\n- suicide gremlins in level 2 combined with many pitfalls in that level - I just prefer to skip this level by going straight right into the secret passage\n- 5 euros for this game?\n\nThis might have been a fun mediocre game but it's too hard due to randomness.\n\n\n----------\nFor anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/","February 28","false","4.7"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","8","17","2","0"

It's hard as hell, just like they used to be.\nIt is very short if you play it straightforward, but can take a lot of time if you decide to pick all the coins to unlock the sword guy.\nThe sub-weapons are very useful, each one which their advantages and disadvantages. It all depends of which stage you are playing, boss you are fighting, and so on.\n\nI recommend only for NES die hard fans.\n\n6/10","March 15","true","1.0"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

The game is challenging and requires a patient mind and skilled hand to time your actions, but this is what some people are looking for.\nThe lore is somewhat "hu3hu3" but is fine.\nAnd the developer is friendly, you can add him and talk to him any time, since hes almost every day online.\nI suggest you to give the game a try, you wont regret it.","November 5, 2015","true","2.3"," 10 of 27 people (37%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","37","10","27","2","3"

It has elements and gameplay of the old school games such as shinobi, legend of Kage (NES) and Super Mario all wrapped into one.  Playing on keyboard can be quite hard, but the game supports USBJoystick and that is what i recommend.  certainly worth a try if you enjoy those kind of old school retro games.","October 8, 2015","true","1.3"," 13 of 35 people (37%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","37","13","35","5","1"
