The game which was originally released in the west last year by Nyu Media and has been since refitted for Steam with a new name Croixleur Sigma and a number of enhancements like 2 player co-op, multiplayer, online leaderboard, Steam achievements, Steam Trading Cards, improve visuals.\n\nThe Japanese audio is a delight addition that compliments the beautiful artwork and soundtrack.\n\nThe graphics is simple, a flashy and full of colorful effects. The artwork is cute to look at.\n\nDon't expect much story because the real focus of the game is combat.

And locking the game to 60 fps in the configuration tool to avoid breaking the game completely.(Very high fps speeds the game up, making it impossible to play.)\n\nAlthough the game is very short it has a ton of replay value with all the different game modes, which are: Story Mode, Arcade Mode, Score Attack, Survival, 30 different challenges and an extra Bonus Mode that unlocks after you complete the Story Mode under a certain time with each character.\n\nThe main focus of this game is to kill every enemy in each of the levels until you advance to the next level, while doing it as fast and efficiently as possible to get the best time possible. Every level also increases the difficulty slightly with tougher monsters, and every 5 levels they throw a boss creature into the mix as well.\n\nDifferent modes such as Score Attack works a little differently, you get 3 minutes to achieve the highest score possible.\nSurvival is exactly what you would expect, survive for as long as possible and kill as many enemies as you can.\nArcade Mode gives you the option to play through the Story Mode levels without any story scenes for nonstop killing.\nAnd finally Bonus Mode, a continuation of the story with more levels and tougher enemies.\n\nWhile playing through Story Mode you will unlock more weapons, each with different stats and special attacks. Think of each weapon as a different move, you can hold up to 4 weapons at a time to build any combo you would like. Oh and the more you use a weapon the higher level it becomes!\n\nThe graphics may not be the most impressive but I think it fits the game very well. The gameplay however is amazing, it made me want to get better and improve after every time I fell in battle and lost some unnecessary time. While the soundtrack did not blow me away I think it accompanies the gameplay really well.\nI had a lot of fun trying to complete all the achievements, it added many extra hours to the game as well as giving me some goals to achieve while playing.\n\nIf you are in it only for the story (which is not much) then this game is probably not for you. However, if you are looking to complete most of the achievements in the game and wondering how long it would take, expect around 12 hours. That is how long it took me to finish everything.\n\nIt's a pretty solid game, so if it looks interesting to you I would definitely recommend picking it up!","July 17, 2014","true","11.8"," 42 of 47 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","42","47","0","0"

It's short. Like really short.\n2. You are probably going to want a controller.\n\nNonetheless, it's fairly fun, and at $8 may be worth a look if you want a quick arena brawler with a bit of customization when it comes to attack set.\n\nI probably need to explain that. The game works on a magic sword (well, they're not all swords, but that's what I'm going to call them) system, not unlike Ys 6, and each sword has a single ability tied to it. By holding down your button for special attacks and pressing one of the four main buttons (jump, bomb, attack, and dash), you'll use one of the abilities of the swords you have equiped. When using an ability, you switch to the sword that ability is tied to, but aside from abilities, the swords aren't actually noticeably different (if at all).\n\nThere's really only probably about 8 enemies in the game in total, including bosses. There's 3 bosses, a melee mob, a ranged mob, 2 big bads, and a flier. There are some color variants that correspond to how tough the enemy is, but that's it really.\n\nThe game has a few mods to play with. There's story, arcade, challenge, score attack, survival, and bonus. Story mode is simply climbing the tower, you must complete this mode under 10 minutes to actually reach the ending. Arcade mode is story with the story sections removed. Challenge is simply a set of challenges for the player to complete. Score attack is attempting to get a high score in 3 minutes. Survival is what you would expect. Bonus mode also serves as an extension to story mode in which you have an AI controlled partner. Not all modes are available until certain condtions are met. Bonus doesn't unlock until beating Story mode with both characters under 10 minutes.\n\nIt should be possible to play scrore attack and survival in co-op, but I've not personally tested it.\n\nOn the topic of characters, aside from aethetics, they're mostly the same. Their swords, although different in look ,end up doing the same things for the most part. There's a few differences in the speed, range, and power of the attacks, but in the end I found myself doing a knock up, followed by an aerial AoE, followed by a ground slam on both characters, with another weapon for ground based AoE. There's a small variations to some other their weapons (one character has an aerial dash and the other has a ground dash), so while the characters aren't significantly different, if you're building a specific attack set to chain together, picking one over the other may matter.\n\nIn any case, it's a simple game without a whole lot of content, but it does what it does pretty well, so at the price that it's at, it may be worth a look.","April 30, 2014","true","5.6"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","38","44","0","0"

It's quick and it's fun.\nControls are simple, you have an attack button, a jump button, dash and an invicibility special. They all do exactly what it says on the tin. There are no variations to basic attacks but the weapons you obtain all have different skills that you can combine in your 4 weapon slots to create cool and/or devastating combos.\nPretty OK replay value thanks to various weapons in other areas not visited before, challenges, a score attack mode and a survival mode.

It takes a bit of repetition (not too much ~ maybe an hour or so)  to reach some level of perfection on your 'speed runs'.\n- There is a good amount of difficulty variation depending on which character you use (Francesca or Lucrezia), which weapon loadout you go with (10 weapons each character while carry 4 weapons at a time), and which challenges you go for (Story/Arcade mode, Score Attack, Survival, Challenge mode, Bonus mode).\n\nAs far as hack and slash/arena brawlers go, I really liked this game for its simplicity. It's quite easy to pick up and play due to the length of the game (15-minute levels) and the straightforward goals.\n\nMy only concern about the game is that it's geared toward the use of a controller, but does not change the button prompts depending on which controller you use. Executing your special attacks can get confusing especially if you customize your controls.","May 5, 2014","true","13.7"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","32","40","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/250640/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","PLOT: Lucrezia wants to take a bath with Francesca. Franny is all "NO WAY IN HELL" and runs off to a massive tower(paging Dr. Freud). Luc has to fight through a dozen or so floors of goblins, flying eyeballs, knights in shining armor, and huge beasts to drag Fran's sorry butt into the tub.\n\nOkay I forgot the actual plot to this game. I assure you all that there is one and it's kinda-sorta-quasi-serious. But who cares about that nonsense? This is a supplemental-arcade-arena-slashemup. If you have less than 15 minutes to spare you can complete a play-through of this game. Yes, this game is a short one, but it's pretty sweet. There are no crazy mission designs, no escorting, no stealth, nothing but just slashing through hundreds of generic foes and grabbing coins.\n\nBefore the game starts you decide on your arsenal. There are 10 weapons per gal and they all have their own special moves. Basically you want a combination of weapons that suit your play-style. Special moves can be chained for more damage, and some are only effective in mid-air, or as anti-air (gotta account for the flying eyes). Don't fuss over your style rating though, this game rewards speed and efficiency above everything else. Yellow enemies drop in a single hit, blues go down in three, and reds take 4+. Once you memorize the basics all you have to worry about is dashing around and mopping everything up.\n\nThere are a variety of modes, but variety is a rather strong word when it comes to Croixleur.\nStory - Kill Everything As Fast As Possible. Lots of plot and talks about baths.\nTime Attack - KEAFAP in 3 minutes\nSurvival - KEAFA you want. Expect to see huge crowds of enemies.\nChallenge - Definitely KEAFAP.\nBonus - This is the epilogue. Luc & Fran team up to bring the hurt on slightly tougher enemies. Don't forget to KEAFAP.\n\nFor the most part Croixleur Sigma is a fast-paced and satisfying slasher. The controls are fluid enough and it's fun zipping around shredding everything. However there are some issues that I have with the game.\n\nCertain moves have weak properties. One of the specials Luc can perform is a downward stab that causes a large shockwave. However, that shockwave is mostly for looks and only hits enemies that are practically under Luc. This tends to be the case with a number of special moves. They look like they should hit because you see the flashy trails and pretty lights connect with enemies, but instead they miss completely. It's...well not really that big an issue. I mean, it's not like it's inconsistent or anything. It would be much worse if the moves hit only some of the time.\n\nAnti-cooperative play. When Luc & Fran team up, it spells trouble...for Luc & Fran. You have to give your BFF plenty of breathing space or she will hit you with her regular and special attacks (and vice-versa). This doesn't do any damage, but it will stun you, and can throw your rhythm off as well as waste time. Maybe the developer thought it would be too easy if this wasn't the case. Luc & Fran could just throw those special moves out constantly and be a whirling dervish of destruction. I disagree. Croixleur Sigma plays up the bestest buddies element, but then implements a design-decision that causes real-world friends to fight? That is a definite head-scratcher. Also during the bonus mode the game only ends when player 1 dies. Player 2 can die as many times as they like. This is something I abused for the cheap final battle.\n\nCroixleur Sigma is like I said, a supplemental game. You play this title alongside your "main" game, or when you absolutely must play something, and don't have much time. It's not a deep game though, not even in terms of game-design depth. If Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae complements games like Devil May Cry and Metal Gear Rising, this game is best played alongside Dynasty Warriors. When you want a dumb 5-minute slashathon, but don't want to run around huge maps and listen to a bunch of talk about Three Kingdoms and whatever whatever, then play this game.","January 13, 2015","true","4.7"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","22","24","4","0"

The answer to that is, a 10 minute Story mode. It will than take about 3 minutes to complete all the "challenges" and than another 3 minutes to do a run through Score Attack mode. After that all there is to do is play Survival Mode over and over again and there really isn't much fun in that.\n\nThere is hardly much of a game here and for the full price of $8 this is pretty pathetic. You can experience the game in it's entirety in less than 20 minutes. About 3 standard enemy types and 3 boss types, all of which can be killed individually in less than 5 seconds. This is probably the easiest arena fighter i've played before.\n\nOh and one more thing, Local Co-op? I don't think so. The current steam version does not contain the required Setup.exe to set the controls for Player 2, so without that you cannot play Co-op. If you manage to track down that file (which I did) you can experience Survival Mode and Score Attack mode with another player, as they walk off the screen or kill you with their special attacks.\n\nYou are much better off buying any other game, as there are a lot of better action games for the same price or less. Hell there are even tons of better free games. Don't waste your money on this. I would say time but even if you buy it, you won't be spending much time with it anyway.\n\nIt's unfortunate though, the combat system is solid and the assets are nice, there could've been a fun game here if it tried but with such an insultingly small amount of content, this is shorter than most demo's.","November 3, 2014","false","1.4"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","24","35","0","1"

But on its own, Croixleur Sigma just falls short and feels like an incomplete game.\n\nI can't really say I would recommend this at the asking price of $7.99, but for a couple of bucks on sale, or maybe grabbed in a bundle with other games, it feels more worth it.\n\nCroixleur is basically a hack and slash game with very simple mechanics. There are no complex combos, or even intermediate ones. We're talking simplest of the simple here when chaining together attacks. It's basically button mash, dash away to dodge attacks, and once in a while throw in an "invincible" special. The arenas are all the same. Just a circle you run around in, with different colors. Someone said this feels like Bloody Palace mode in the Devil May Cry games. But that is just the thing, the Bloody Palace Mode was just a mode in a larger game, and a much deeper game at that in terms of combat.\n\nAs it stands on its own, the story mode is just too short, with literally only 3 types of bosses, with 2 of the boss types becoming standard enemies after you beat them, which can be dropped with the greatest of ease with a simple hit hit dash, rinse and repeat set of moves. As for the standard enemies there are 3 types, with a few levels of difficulty for each. It's just...wow. Lazy. Besides story mode, you can tackle a time attack, survival and challenge mode. And that's pretty much it.\n\nThere are 2 characters to play as, with 20 weapons total to use once you unlock them all. There is not much difference in any of the weapons other than attack power,  their special, and of course the weapon skins. For basic attacks they are pretty much all similar.\n\nI have less than an hour in the game. Yes, less than an hour. But in that hour I managed to play through story mode twice. Once making it as far as the timer allowed, and the 2nd time actually completing story mode, and then to try out the other modes afterwards. I am already bored with the title.\n\nBuy this I guess if you like repetitive score attack type action games with extremely little style and substance.","May 3, 2015","false","0.9"," 28 of 43 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","28","43","0","4"

Great! Now, on to the... credits.\nGame over, after about 30 minutes.\n\nYou can go back in with a different weapon, or a difficulty multiplier, but that's it. Essentially 15 or so identical rooms of hack and slash monster fighting.\n\nWhat's so disappointing about Croixleur (other than the fact that you never get to hear anybody try to pronounce the name) is that the hack and slash combat is so well done. It's thoroughly enjoyable for the fleeting campaign. By all rights this should be an epic fantasy RPG with upgradeable weapons and scaling player stats and a bunch of bosses to fight. Like a GameCube or PS2 action RPG. I'd play that and love it and not care that I'm a 26 year old man (Before you judge me, know that I got this in a bundle) playing a game as a weird 13 year old anime girl because the combat is so satisfying.\nUnfortunately that's not the case. You get 15 identical rooms full of maybe 4 different monsters. You get a surprisingly large variety of weapons to find and unlock, but who cares when you can only take them back to that same arena?\nController support is a bit odd, since the buttons are either mapped wrong for the gameplay or for the menus, but never right for both. In theory there's local co-op, but I haven't tried it and I'm a bit skeptical that it'll work right.\nBasically, pick this up if you like hack and slash games and have run out of other options, and you can get it for under $2. Otherwise, keep an eye out for these devs to release a much larger game with the same battle system and grab that instead.","July 15, 2014","false","1.7"," 26 of 43 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","26","43","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/250640/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","One of the things I love most about arena brawlers is how they can take simple to understand and execute mechanics, and turn them into deep satisfying combat through various systems and enemy designs. Croixleur Sigma gets at least part of this right, but leans too heavily toward simplicity to have any long lasting appeal. Its mechanics are sound but excessively basic, and the limited amount of content makes it hard to wring more than an hour or two of enjoyment out of the experience, which ultimately left me wanting.\n\nNothing about Croixleur could be described as especially innovative, but that's not entirely a bad thing as it builds itself upon a proven design that has persisted because it works. Dropped at the foot of a tower, you ascend floors clearing out waves of enemies, ultimately ending in a boss and maybe a new weapon. The catch is that you're on a strict time limit, which if exceeded will lot you out of the real ending or fail you all together. It's a good method for pushing you to find faster more powerful combos, but it does mean that by design the game can be beaten in about ten minutes. There are two characters each with their own unique weapons to unlock and dialog, along with some trivial challenges and hi-score modes, but despite all of this the amount of content still seems far too little.\n\nWhat Croixleur does well is its blisteringly fast button mashing combat, which feels fantastic once you get the hang of using the dash ability and various special abilities inherent to different weapons. The problem though is it doesn't go further than this. While it's fun to sprint around wacking baddies over the head, it's extremely repetitive and allows virtually no room to grow once you've mastered its few mechanics. The brainless enemies (though typical of the genre) are little more than practice dummies to beat upon, and with only a handful of different varieties become tedious to fight after your first few times through the tower. I also found the way special abilities work to be rather convoluted, requiring you to both push the correct button and be on the correct plane for them to work, and even then it was hard to predict which ability was going to activate as pressing a button repeatedly cycles through all your specials instead of simply activating whichever is assigned to said button.\n\nCroixleur Sigma isn't a bad game, in fact I had a great time with it, but it's mechanics are so shallow and its content so limited that it's hard to recommend entirely. It's amusing and colorful, satisfying to a degree, and solid enough to entertain, but just know that you are unlikely to put more than an hour or two into it before it grows stale. In the face of its many far more engaging and deeper contemporaries, it never manages to be anything more than average, but if you're just looking for a quite fix then at the very least it will satisfy your need for badass lolis that like to kick the living hell out of demons. That alone ought to count for something.","August 13, 2014","true","2.4"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","2"

I'm not talking about being "a bit loud" here, the BGM sound is, if anything, made for Arduino speakers with the volume set to -1%. I had to instantly mute the game. Thing is, the music volume doesn't actually change except if you put it to 0, where it simply disappears. I couldn't change this, not even with reinstalling the game. (Headset: Razer Tiamat 7.1, Soundcard: Asus Xonar DX)\n\nNext problem was, this game doesn't run with a PS4 controller. Like, not at all. I could press any buttons and nothing happened, neither in the configuration tool nor in the actual game. I thought, maybe it just didn't accept the PS4 controller as a viable controller, BUT basically all games that have XBox 360 controller support also work with the PS4 controller (E.g. Blade Kitten worked perfectly). Also, the pre-setup left stick DID actually work, but I couldn't assign any other keys in any way. In the end I had to use a long forgotten program, Joy2Key, to map the keyboard settings to the controller (which was also quite a bit of pain, because the key setup of Croixleur kept setting up keys while the window wasn't even active) and ended up with a weird mix of pressing escape on my keyboard and trying to figure out the controller buttons that were mapped to the keys the game told me to press.\n\nSo for the gameplay then - the gameplay itself was, well, expected. I guess it would be a fun game to play every now and then, if the controls weren't so horrible to set up.\nAlthough I gotta say, I've lately played a lot of games that made the controls feel more fluent than this.\n\nIn the end, I can't really recommend it because the decent gameplay got overshadowed by the time it took to even get it running.\n\nIf you have a controller you know this game will run fine with, and you want gameplay pretty much exactly as presented in the screenshots, go ahead. If you're trying to find the next best indie game or you only have a PS4 controller, probably not.","January 17, 2015","false","0.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

The combo system is a bit shallow until you start unlocking weapons to round out your repertoire. Even with a weapon to give you a launcher or a dashing attack, your base combo never changes much.\n\nMost of your enjoyment will come from what you can get out of score chasing the highest combo by abusing the mechanics as far as you can, such as chaining combos together by stringing them together with dash cancels and AoE sweeps.

Even without expensive set pieces these games can easily get by as long as the combat system is polished. Croixleur is a good example of this as the game features 3 enemies, 3 unique bosses, and a single arena. But the gameplay is polished and that's enough to carry the experience and warrant a purchase.\n\nMuch like classic arcade titles, the focus of Croixleur is developing player skill and going for high scores. With the 8-15 minute story/arcade mode the focus of the scoring is based mostly on speed, rewarding events and the epilogue fight purely based on how efficiently the player can clear out the waves of enemies. With the Steam achievements based around completing skill-based challenges, there is quite a few hours of speedrunning fun to be had in that 10 minute story mode.\n\nAlternative review:\n\nIf you're a fan of:\nAttack - cancel into dash - cancel dash into attack - cancel into special move - cancel into dash - repeat... then you'll find a lot to love here.\n\nHighly recommended to lovers of action games, anime girls with swords, and fans of getting carpal tunnel.","February 7, 2015","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very fun game, with most game modes lasting <15 minutes for a full playthrough, making it great for pick up and play without being "casual" difficulty-wise (there's an easy mode and a control assist for those who like it easy, but I didn't try them). Gameplay focuses on constant movement and defeating everything fast without getting hit. Everything feels like a score-attack. Story mode is short, but needs to be played several times to perfect/get true ending and all the items. Several extra modes like survival and challenges add a lot more making it easily worth $8 worth of play.\n\nTechnically speaking, the game has a couple issues though. There's constant tearing basically no matter what your vsync settings are. I, surprisingly, got used to it pretty quick though and it's usually a dealbreaker for me. The tearing is so constant and moves so little it's pretty easy to ignore.\n\nControls are a little weird, I recommend remapping them so that dash is a shoulder button.

That doesn’t mean that it is a bad game. Sure in most cases I related a short game being a bad game. I have finally found a game where I can’t say that about. This might also be one of the shortest reviews I will ever do. Simply because of how short the game is. Let’s get to it then shall we ?\n\nCroixleur is an action indie game with hack and slashing at it’s core.  Simple yet effective combat. Keeping in mind I did not do the tutorial for the game as your reading this review.  When you first start you pick between Story, Time Attack, or Survival and later unlocking Challenge mode. The story mode is timed. The trick is to get to the final floor and beat the boss within the allotted 15 minute time period.  I started with story mode. It asks you which character you want to play but at that point I had only one character.  So I had no choice but to pick her, and I had only one weapon to start with.\n\nAs the first level opened there was some nice anime style artwork with text as it’s cutscenes. I for one would have loved have seen some actual animation work for the cutscenes. The story was pretty underwhelming, generic. Not bad. Just…. not good. I won’t give you many, if any spoilers in that regard. So after the cutscenes end I walk through a portal and the first real level begins. As I fight I level up which to be totally honest I am not sure it did anything at all.  As I played I also would unlock new weapons but could never figure out how to swap to them in combat. Up to 4 total at once and if I unlocked more weapons it told me I could change them at start of my next game.\n\nNow the combat was simple but fun. Had more depth to it as noticed later on. You get your basic attack which you can chain together to kill things. A big portion of the game is to keep a high chain of attacks going without taking damage. The higher chain the better score you get at the end of the level/story.  There was a dash that you could use to escape hits which also consumed mp. I often used this to dash through bosses to hit them without having the fear of taking hits myself. Then of course you got jump. There were several flying creatures that you had to jump and attack to destroy. These I found to be very annoying… SUPER ANNOYING… Especially seeing as how they were almost always the cause of me losing my combo..err Chain.  Then you get a special attack. Seemed like it was the same no matter what weapon I had. It is possible it was the special attack for said character.  I know the info for the game says each weapon has it’s own unique attack. I guess I just never figured that out.\n\nThe controls of the game I found to be very finicky, and super annoying at times. For one if you change your controls, the on screen queues don’t change. The camera controls often didn’t work at all.  It didn’t take to much out of combat but there were a few times where I got hit from something behind me or off screen that I couldn’t see.\n\nUltimately you work your away against time and things trying to kill you to get to the top of the tower… Or was it the bottom… Either way you are there to learn the secrets behind the Adjuvant Trial. I saw maybe five different types of monsters the entire game. The basic melee unit, a spell caster, a flying eyeball thing, and a giant knight that looked almost mechanical.  Now the mobs would spawn with different colors showing they had different strengths based on their color. This was rather uninspired if you ask me. The game would be so much well… cooler if there were more things to kill. I honestly felt like I saw all the game had to offer in a single eleven minute run that it took me to complete the story.\n\nAs you play through the levels ever so often it gives you two ways to advance. I’m not sure how much effect this actually has on the game but I know when I got to my final boss it was a dragon. Or it looked like a dragon at least. This was undoubtedly my favorite part of the game. Mostly because of the dialogue!\n\nThe boss fight was fun. The best part of the game for sure. After beating it I unlocked Challenge mode and did a few of the other game modes. Ultimately it is just the same thing. Over and over. The price of the game is $7.99 which isn’t bad. If your someone who enjoys scoregasm action games then you might want to pick this up. I can say that the action was  fun, and it is likely that I missed a lot of the game itself by not doing the tutorial. But COME ON!! Who does those anymore!?\n\nI give this game a Drastik Measure 7.2/10\n\nIt is not the worst game I have played. Definitely not the best. Easily a game to pick up when your bored and want a quick burst of something to do. The price might still be a tad steep but if the game is fun that is what matters most.

While I'm sure it's possible to play with a keyboard, the game plays MUCH better when played with a controller.\n\nBesides that, this is a very well polished hack and slash / character action game. It takes a little while to get used to using the ability system while in an actual fight, but when you actually learn to perform combos with them, you'll be really glad that you did.\n\nI'll admit that I don't play a huge amount of these kind of games, but I felt the game was fair without being over-easy on the difficulty curve, and the mixture of dashing and attacking was fast, fluid, and pretty damn fun. The game even manages to work in the classic 'Vergil'/rival/worthy opponent fight.\n\nThe story is pretty light on the ground, but what's there is good: the characters are likeable, the dialogue is actually really well translated, and the banter the two heroines share is amusing to no end*. I actually would really like to explore and see this sort of world the game is based in, if only because the dialogue suggests something greater than the game's total sum is going on outside of the game's events.\n\nThere's also quite a few modes to play around in, so even if the story is pretty quick to go, there's a decent amount of replayability, even if highscores and leaderboards aren't your cup of tea.\n\nOver all, an enjoyable hack and slash which is pretty noob-friendly, with an amusing story and interesting setting, even if the former is light and the ground and we only get a few hints at the later. If you can, pick it up and see if there's anything for you in there.\n\n\n*There's also some sub-text in there (which becomes more or less just text by the end), so if you were looking for that kind of thing...","January 13, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The dialogue is playful and amusing, the characters are well-drawn, and there seem to be a variety of abilities and enemies.  But the keyboard controls are so terrible that the movement keys only register a tiny step per press, and will not recognize continued movement when holding down the key.  Luckily, the game supports a controller...but only for movement.  The controller buttons cannot be assigned to attacks, so the only way to do anything is to move the character by the controller, while hitting the attack buttons on the keyboard.  Basic attacks work this way, however annoying it is, but I can't get special attacks to trigger except by blind luck.\n\nThere may be controllers that work with this game, but the inconsistent support is in itself a sign of poor design.","December 14, 2014","false","1.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Perhaps one or two people might enjoy the recycled lines and pointlessly sexualised references to the two main characters bathing together as children, but everyone else would be better off just skipping it entirely.\n\nFor all its flaws, Croixleur Sigma does manage to neatly toe the line of 'easy to pick up, hard to master' – a balance which many games from much larger developers simply can't seem to manage. The variety available in weaponry and gameplay modes also means there's potentially some good replay value here, although anyone who isn't a fan of time attack gameplay will probably lose interest quite quickly, and owners of the original release may only find another hour or two of new gameplay here.\n\nRead my full review here: http://www.hookedgamers.com/pc/croixleur_sigma/review/article-1238.html","May 28, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The voice acting is surprisingly decent if you don't mind Japanese voices. The graphics are reminiscent of a PS2 game, but runs very well at 60 fps.\n\nWith all the other stuff out of the way, I can get to the gameplay. First off, the best way to judge if you like the sort of game is simply to download the demo. It's a small download, and even if the demo gives you a minute of gameplay, you should quickly decide if you like it.\n\nA lot of people compare this to Devil May Cry, but it feels much more like Dynasty warriors with a rapid dodge/dash button. The enemy AI is weak, and similar to that of a Dynasty Warriors. You have a generic invincibility attack to bust out when needed. Finally, you collect swords as you play. Equipping them leads to different abilities, and the ability to form your own combos, as many of the abilities are seamlessly linkable. Once again, somewhat similar to a character's abilities in a Dynasty Warriors game. The dodge button allows people to zip around the confined arenas, and really speed up the game. It ends up feeling like a bit of a mix between Dynasty Warriors, and Devil May Cry, although obviously the game doesn't have near the production value of either.\n\nThe game has a bunch of different modes, arcade/story are by the far the most enjoyable. Challenge mode is a joke and can often be won without using anything but autoattack and dodge/dash. You will beat the story mode in under 15 minutes, but getting the different swords, leveling them(which doesn't seem to do much), and getting the achievements has been a lot of fun. The combat just feels fluid and satisfying. You'll feel super powerful, extremely quick, but that's the point. There seems to be an extremely low skill cap in the game, which also makes me wary to compare it to Devil May Cry. All in all though, it's a genuinely fun game.\n\nTLDR: Try the demo, or watch a video of the gameplay. There's not much hidden, and what you see is what you get.","July 1, 2014","true","3.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The combat is nice, and the character's are... Well, interesting.\nCombat Thingies There's different weapons to pick from, I actually enjoy the weapon design designs a lot. The combat is essentially a beat em up in a tower full of three monsters. Yeah, that's it. All the enemies are just recolors of the same three with a bit more health. Just copy and paste an area and then give them a bit more health, add like three more of the recolored enemy, pass it off as the next level in the tower.\nStory Related Thingies and Gamemode Stuff  The story mode is incredibly short and easy, like, I'd say around 15 minutes. Even the giant knights that look intimidating turn out to be easy. Giant creature (gotta avoid spoilers) that's been built up with suspense at end of tower? Nope, weak. You beat the story that ended up being way too short and generally uninteresting then you unlock challenges. The first thing that comes to mind is "Hey! Replayability!" Sadly, there's not too much replayability even with the selection of different weapons and challenges. The characters have a lot of potential as well, sadly they end up being boring and feel a bit 2-Dimensional. The delivery of dialogue is just a picture of a character with text to the left of them. That's it. Ocassionally they change facial expressions, but they stay in the same pose.\nSo, should you buy it? I wouldn't recommend that you buy it. There's one exception however. If you love playing games over and over, learning their mechanics, and constantly playing it to find the best possible ways to beat it. If you strive to master the game in the fastest way possible, easiest way, or even the hardest way. If you're one of those people, then maybe. Even if you are, there are way better games for that than this. Even when I picked this up for $3.99 at a sale, I can't recommend it at that price. It's such a shame, I was really excited to try this game when I saw it.\nTL;DRGame with great potential turns out to be short, easy, and has uninteresting story with bland recolored enemies you have to fight.\nThe real final boss is the disappointment you get after you beat the game.\nRating : 3/10","April 30","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In the realm of Ilance, two female prodigies representing the Knight and Aristocratic factions will do battle in ‘the Adjuvant Trial’. The winner will earn the right for their respective faction to hold political and military authority in Ilance as well as the sacred duty of protecting the queen. The game's main protagonists are the reckless red head Lucrezia Visconti and the stalwart serious Francesca Storaro.\n\nCrioxleur Sigma has five gameplay modes: Story, Score attack, Survival, Challenge and Dramatic battle which is the games local 2 player co-op. The games controls are fully rebindable and using a controller is certainly recommended as it provides the best experience, its the easiest to use and to be honest I would argue its borderline required to have a fun experience. Story mode tells the tale of the two protagonists as they face the Adjuvant Trail which is a series of levels that become more difficult as you progress. Story mode is also timed, you have 15 minutes to complete the tower and depending on how quickly or slowly you progress different cutscenes may occur.\n\nLet's dive right into the core of the game which is combat. The game's combat revolves around combos, by combining your standard attacks with your weapons special attack you can created devastating combo's to put down your enemies. Combat is fast paced, it's all about movement and attacking, if you stand routed you will get hit so hit and run tactics are often required. Movement is helped by dashing, you can dash several times in quick succession until your MP runs out. Similar to RPG's as you defeat enemies your character levels up increasing HP and MP, the more MP you have the more you can dash around the circular battlefield. The way dashing feels in the game is similar to watching old dragonball z anime fights where the characters would have huge movement bursts then attack then another burst, it feels very cool.\n\nUltimately the game is all about score, higher scores are achieved by gathering chains. You achieve chains by collecting the coins that enemies drop upon death. However if you get hit once your chain will be broken and you'll have to start over. Coins also have a dual purpose not only are they required for chains but each character has a powerful special attack once used you need to collect coins to be able to use it once again. It's best to save this attack for tough bosses and enemies as its hard to accumulate it back.\n\nSpeaking of enemies, there’s not much in way of enemy variety. There are three types of normal enemy, melee, ranged and flying. Enemies are also colour coded to show which difficulty they are for example yellow is the easiest, purple are the hardest. The tougher the enemies, the more HP they will have and thus they will require more attacks to take down. In later levels enemies also get an increase in speed, making it tougher to avoid their attacks. There are also boss occasional boss enemies that are tough to take down, its all about learning their attack patterns and also using your characters special attack to take them down.\n\nAs you progress you will also unlock weapons which vary in design, attack damage and each have a special attack. Once you unlock a weapon you'll be able to select it when choosing your loadout on the next playthough. There are 20 weapons to collect and several playthoughs of story mode will be required to collect them all.\n\nOverall the game provides a fun fast paced hack and slash experience. Though personally I would have liked a longer, expanded and fully fleshed out story mode. I would have also liked more enemy variety, the same enemies while they do get tougher don't change in terms of mechanics and its more a case of you being faster rather than adapting to new tactics. If your a big score seeker you'll certainly get your money's worth from the game however if your looking for a deeper story driven experience it's best to look else where.","April 29, 2014","true","1.4"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","0"

This is intentional, and part of the game's scoring.\n\nThe story isn't anything you'll really resolve, nor is it something that'll win writing award, but it sets the tone of the game and works well enough. I admittedly have a weakness for the voice cast, so I'll leave it at that. The overall tone is pretty cute.\n\nThe visuals are good for the 2 girls, but the enemy designs are a little on the bland side. The game is also pretty easy unless you're going for high scores, and the combat system starts simple, but abit of knowhow allows you to get gloriously long combos and stomping through enemies with narry a scratch.\n\nThe achievement system in it is silly, since it requires you to unlock the ones preceeding it in order to get a given achievement, even if you've basically qualified for it repeatedly in the process of unlocking those.\n\nUnfortunately, the Steam Cloud support doesn't actually work at all, so you'll need to take your save with you manually.\n\nIf you have some change lying around, it's not a bad game to lose an afternoon or two to.","August 21, 2014","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/n131/recommended/250640/","n131","CuteHat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/n131/","86 products in account","Croixleur Sigma is the game that inspired me to use the new Steam refund function, and with a 15 minute story mode, it was a decision I think most people can arrive at quickly.\n\nAs far as technical quality goes, it’s really not great, despite its simplicity. Supporting 1600 x 900 resolution but only allowing fullscreen in a smaller or larger size seemed like an arbitrary limitation, though I doubt I would have played in 1600 x 900 anyway, as when i tried to play it windowed, no 3D assets at all loaded. The 2D UI would appear on screen, sure, but the actual game was just black. Full screen in non native resolutions didn’t go over so well when using a gamepad (which they explicitly recommended) as the analog controls were all wonked up. So I had settle for windowed mode on a non-native resolution because the other options straight up did not work. Even if you select the option to unlock the FPS, it stays locked 60; that’s not really a huge issue but it does serve to show how much the developers even cared about technical quality. Honestly I was underwhelmed by this game before I even played. And yet still, I played:\n\nWhen I got into the actual game, they tried to set up some kind of irrelevant narrative, I’m guessing it’s “Because that’s what real games do, r-right guys?” Instead they only raise more questions. The kingdom is ruled by a Queen who has two constituencies: the knights and the aristocrats, but it’s not really explained what the importance of that is. They throw in some poem about the struggle between the two constituencies but that ends up just being some casual contest that exists just because. The aristocrats are warriors despite the fact that those are usually the last people to ever fight in any kind of battle, and they go to their own training academies to become better fighters. The knights basically do the same, but maybe they have to earn their way in? I’m not sure, they never really say. The two characters are of different class but apparently still bathed together as children and assuming that was important dialogue and not just some ♥♥♥♥-tier weeb-bait trite, it felt like they were implying knights were treated the same as aristocrats, so, why the need for two classes anyway? If knights prove their worth with combat prowess, and are held to the same training standards as aristocrats, then why even conscript aristocrats into the academy to begin with when you’ll just end up wasting time training a bunch of people that don’t actually want to be trained. Seems kind of dumb. But the developers didn’t seem to care about the writing either, so I guess we shouldn’t either. I’m just saying, if you maybe did care about writing, there’s nothing of merit in this game at all in those regards, and I could go on about that even longer.\n\nThe game throws in a bunch of weapons with different special attacks, but the basic attacks are all the same. considering the game was easily beatable without the use of any special attacks, I have to question their importance. Most of them seem like extra-strong hits which would basically just kill your combo score so there’s no point in using them if you’re trying to get a high score (which is all there is to do in this game, mind you). You’re better off saving your MP for the dash anyway because it lets you get the game over with even easier, especially the final boss: just let it knock you into the air and you can just dash and attack up there and land hits on him without having to come back down, and effectively dodge all of his attacks without even trying. It’s really not that competent. Somehow spending $4 on this seems like too much for what I got, what with the levels repeating and all. The enemies got harder, as in they got more HP and that’s it, and they even managed to do that incompetently: instead of making enemies of the same strength uniform in color, they just gave random colors to whatever they felt like: purple, yellow, black, red--it was hard to tell what an enemy’s strength was based on that because there was no consistency to the color coding between enemies at all.\n\nYeah basically this game is a waste of time. Just don’t bother.","August 10, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Croixleur Sigma has strict time limits. You should never be moving on foot, and instead should be dashing everywhere to optimize your time. This quickly turns MP management into a chore.\n\nThere is also lesbian flirting in this game.","March 2","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is always fun even if it's an extremely short and easy game but it's okay since there are some challenges i guess.\nBut then this version does not have the other new 2 extra characters...  So do not be fooled thinking the steam version is the best version out.\n\nI played one hour here and unlocked all there is to unlock has it is. Unless they update the version to it's latest with all 4 characters + some new achievement i cannot recommand this... Not even when in a special offer. Unless it goes down to 1$ then go for it.\n\n1$ for 1hour of fun sounds fair enough.\n\nI will change my point of view if they ever update or add a DLC so we get all the costumization stuff and the new characters from the latest version of the game.","August 12, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has neat attacks, and bouncing the enemies around and into each other is fun.  The characters are cute, and the dashing is high speed and fluid.","August 12, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lol\n\nIt's an arena hack n slash type game. If you like that sort of thing, this game is totally up your alley and for its price you can't really go wrong.\nIt's super fun and entertaining.\n\nThe only qualms I have about it are the fact that there wasn't really an explanation to anything (you have to manually go seek out the tutorial, I didn't even know there was one at first) and the controls still show the original from the console version.\nIf you have a gamepad, you can map your keys no problem, but if you're trying to play with your keyboard and you don't know what button the weapon on "C" is mapped to, looking in the controls won't help you for that.\n\nOther than that, it's pretty fun. I come back to it every now and again just to smack stuff with ma swords. =]","February 7","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
