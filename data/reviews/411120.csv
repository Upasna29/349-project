I though the game already released. Doesn't feel like an early access game at all.\n\nGalaxy Admirals is a solid turn based strategy game.\nIt got its own unique gameplay style where each turn the field is getting rotated and things aren't the same as the last turn.\nA promising game for the price.","December 14, 2015","true","2.9"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","20","23","4","2"

The goal is to destroy the enemy base by protecting yours with your own fleet. Each turn will grant you a crystal that can be used to build different ships: support (gathering crystals on the map but also repairing anything that will be suffering damage), missile carrier, etc..\n\nThe twist is that the hexagonal map is turning, making the field different each time, mainly with the asteroids that can block your path suddenly (but the enemy's too). I suppose that more obstacles will appear along the way as I'm only at level 4 in the campaign.\n\nBecause of the twist, you need to be careful and try not to be blocked, though you don't know how the field will change.\n\nThe visuals are simple as it's a top-down map but they're also neat. The soundtrack is correct.\n\nNot being a strategy fan, I've an hard time to think about my fleet and with the field changing each time, I'm not really at ease. It means that Galaxy Admirals is not my cup of tea at all. Yet, I'm pretty sure that fans of the genre will see in it a relaxing game compared to the blockbusters of that kind. I suppose that the multiplayer can bring more fun.\n\nFor the price, you will not be robbed. So, go for it if you're a fan or if you want to try the genre.\n\n3/12/15: Just a friendly reminder for those who wants to copy/paste this review for getting 10 credits on orlygift. I got the game there, I wrote a review there, so you bet that I'll be reporting you.","November 28, 2015","true","5.4"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

The UI is dominated by massively oversized buttons. There are no tooltips, nor use of the right mouse button, nor clicking and dragging. In addition, the game feels cheap; several spelling errors were noted while playing, and the graphics are simple and repetitive. The turn-based gameplay itself is a bit simple and dull. It plays almost like a board game; save for the twist that the board rotates under you with each turn.\n\nIf it was on my phone, I might keep it around to play through the campaign whenever I was in an area without mobile data. Long story short, you get what you pay for, and this feels like a $0.49 game; but even then, there are many free games on Steam or elsewhere that I would recommend over this.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I was given a free key for this game, and offered additional compensation to play it and write a review. Despite that, I have tried to give my opinion as honestly as possible.","November 29, 2015","false","0.6"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","20","29","0","0"

The game is played in a top-down perspective like most strategy games.\n\nFrankly, unlike most Early Access games I have played, Galaxy Admiral actually feels like a finished game, albeit short.\n\nThe game is played on a hexagonal map but what makes this game unique is that the map rotates at the end of each turn around a “Blue Star”, placed in the centre of the map. This may not seem like much but this mechanic adds a lot of depth to the combat as the player needs to adapt to the situation, plan ahead and outwit the AI to achieve victory.\n\nThe objective of the game is to destroy the enemy base while protecting your own by using your fleet of ships. The ships are unique and have their own properties which fit their design. Crystals are consumed to make ships. Each player gains a crystal on their respective turn and crystal fragments which are placed on the map can be harvested by specific ships.\n\nThere are 15 missions in the campaign mode and the game can also be played in multiplayer mode, where all the fleet ships have been unlocked before-hand. A sandbox mode has also been added where you can test your abilities against the AI.\n\nSpeaking of the AI, it is surprisingly good though it can be predictable at times as it focuses more on the objective than your ships it is good nonetheless.\n\nEach map has a fixed amount of objects that spawn to match its theme, so the placement of objects is not always the same when playing a specific map again. This is actually a nice touch as players cannot rely on the same strategy when replaying a map.\n\nThe visuals and soundtrack are actually quite good for a game of this price, though the animations are simple. Players can also choose the resolution and graphics quality when they start the game, which is a nice addition. The game also has achievements and trading cards which is a plus.\n\nHonestly, the only mechanic that I do not like about the game is that while playing campaign mode you get logged into the multiplayer lobby, while playing a single-player mode. This is annoying and sometimes frustrating as other players might spam invites for a multiplayer match while you are trying to focus on the campaign battles.\n\nIn the end Galaxy Admirals offers what it has to for its price and there is little chance for a buyer to feel robbed of his money considering the cost of this game. Galaxy Admirals is a great game for any strategy genre lover and casual gamers.","January 11","true","5.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

Has a challenging campaign and a developing multiplayer mode. It has enough complexity to feel rewarding but also simple enough to play casually, I plan to make it one of my time sinks while I listen to podcasts/videos/music, it really nails the mellow/relaxed playstyle I like when doing those things.

The only part that isn’t easily possible in the real world is the “spinning” of the board after each player’s turn (it would be possible to reproduce in the real world, but incredibly tedious).\n\nThe AI in this game is not great: on a new level I found myself sometimes losing the first attempt simply because I got off to a slow start with the new concepts introduced. However, the second attempt was always a win because the AI is highly predictable and doesn’t exploit bad human choices about half the time.\n\nI haven’t yet gotten this played with a human opponent, which is a shame as it would seem the game is really focused on human versus human. This is a “recommended” only to those who really are into two player abstract board games.\n","January 17","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The rotating board literally adds a fascinating twist to turn based tactics.\n\nIf you love challenging and complex game play then this game is definitely for you. Yet the learning curve is fairly gentle. Play starts simply with the complexity slowly emerging as each new unit is added.\n\nBeing early access there are rough edges of course, but there is already hours of quality entertainment to be enjoyed.

Basically I had some money in my steam wallet aand this looked interesting, so I picked it up, at first glance the UI looks like a mobile port, but the game works fine with mouse and runs really smooth on my PC, looks pretty good too when you have the graphics cranked up.\n\nGameplay: This game is a turn based strategy game set in a solar system, unlike a lot of turn based space strategy games this game has no extra fluff, no meta CCG elements, no 4X style campaign mode, just a simple to learn, but suprisingly complex strategy game. The twist with this game is that everything on the map rotates around the center, although it seems like this wouldn't matter as relative positions would stay the same, that actually isn't true, because everything orbits at the same speed things closer to the center go around faster than things on the edge, these rotations really add new depth and it takes some time to get used to, but the devs have really taken advantage of this with delayed attacks and timed bombs that can taking advantage of the orbiting system.\n\nContent: At the time of writing this review (5/13/2016) there are 2 races implimented into multiplayer, 1 campaign (for the humans, ps: no story just kind of a tutorial and extra ai battles), 9 Human ships, 9 Alien Ships (kinda ten b/c aliens have a ship that can build nanobots), and a sandbox for you to test out new things or play hotseat on the same computer with your friends.\n\nThere are some gameplay mechanics that I didn't go over like the resource system, but you can figure that out once you buy the game, oh, and by the way, BUY THE GAME.\n\nMy ONLY major complaint is this game doesn't have enough players, so it can be hard to find a match online, but it's more fun to play against your friends and family anyway, so personally, I dont care as much, but if you want to be MLG and wreck everyone online, you might be a little dissapointed with the amount of people that go online on any given day.\n\nIf I had to rate it with 5 being an average game, I would give Galaxy Admirals a 7/10, and that will only go up as the game moves further into development with the planned 3rd race coming out and the alien campaigns.

I would recomend getting it for anyone that likes strategy games. The single player games get really fun after the first couple of boring missions.

I though the game already released.
