For instance, most VNs require the player to focus on pursuing specific girl, often at expense of being cold or downright rude to other girls to avoid getting unwanted “points” with them. Fading Hearts recognizes that being nice to a girl doesn’t mean you are romantically interested in her, and ultimately places decision of who to pursue into your hands. It encourages supporting all your friends regardless of your romantic interest, which I find a refreshing change from many other VNs.\n\nNot to say that the plot can’t force something upon you, it sure can. But even when the choice is taken from you, it is the result of what you choose earlier – choose poorly!\n\nTo sum it up, I fully recommend Fading Hearts to everyone who enjoys VNs. And for people not familiar with the genre, I’d say it is a good choice of the first VN if they want to try them out.","February 6, 2014","true","27.4"," 289 of 325 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","289","325","0","0"

So if you're on a track for a good ending with one of the girls, it is entirely possible at the last minute for your girlfriend to not speak to you for 3 weeks while another ending plays out, and for her to totally forget you guys were even going out, and for the game to tell you that you are in love with someone you haven't spoken to since the intro.  There are endings where you start a relationship with a girl.....who you have already been in a relationship with since March.  There are endings that contradict you discovering someone's "secret identity" and tell you that you have no idea who they are.  I swear, the game is great up until the endings but a VN that doesn't give you closure is like a horror game with bloom effects.  Completely playable but you constantly ask yourself "why?"","March 5, 2015","false","4.2"," 98 of 108 people (91%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","91","98","108","12","2"

I knew nothing about Fading Hearts before I decided to pick it up not knowing what to expect. From the main store page it seemed interesting enough for the $10 I paid for it. I have to say, I was quite dissapointed to be frank.\n\nFirst I'm going to go over what I liked about the game. The gameplay was really interesting and fun, definitely felt more closer towards a Dating sim. You get stats you can raise by doing various activities throughout the day and the stats (usually) have some effect on the game, such as how much money you get and beating certain monsters in the forest. There is a combat system, though not very in-depth, was entertaining for the first few times. And the game strongly encourages and is ment to be played with multiple playthroughs for all the endings, even including some cute dialouge at the end of each playthrough that provide hints on what to do on your next one.\n\nOne thing that interested me into buying the game was the "Player-Active Storytelling! NPCs tries to manipulate you, the player!" feature on the store page. I seriously did not feel this at all, in any of the playthroughs. I felt fully in control the entire time as with every dialogue option you can easily see what the consequences were and what path you were going to go down. The "Players can actively manipulate story mechanics once they understand how they work." was just a fancy way of saying choose A or B like you do in any other game/VN, nothing intuitive there.\n\nYou get stats and other progress bars that you can raise that can influence your money income, and combat stats. It had very good potentional to be very good but in the end it was pointless. You honestly don't need money that much, the only time you really would need to spend money is on things to obtain even more money. You don't need to touch the system at all and can do very well without, theres no real benefit it was a waste of time. You can also choose to do various excercises and train magic spells as well for combat. However, to reach the ending that relied a bit on combat you didn't need to be very strong at all. Once you hit a certain threshold (which isn't very high) it was pointless and a waste of time. It would've been nice if they added something that required or rewarded spending more time on raising those stats.\n\nHowever, the thing that bothered me the most, is that the story was absolutely terrible. I definitely felt like it was more gameplay oriented storytelling than an actual story. Of course the story changes with your actions (as expected with multiple endings and such) but each time I was never satisfied. The climaxes to each ending felt very bland, and the actual endings were extremely cliche and predictable. The characters are REALLY flat and I'm not talking about their chests. They have little personality and no development whatsoever. Side characters are pretty irrelevant and you only speak to certain ones to obtain endings.\n\nLastly, the game is super short. I spent about 15 hours on the game but really thats because I left the game on while I fell asleep. Each playthrough is about 30mins-1hour long at most. If it takes longer, thats because you're trying to figure out what to do to get the other endings which won't take long. You can probably get all the endings in one sitting if you wanted.\n\nThe game had a lot of potential but I felt like it was released a bit too soon or the writing could've been better. The idea and design was good but it had no depth whatsoever.","July 12, 2014","false","15.9"," 175 of 219 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","175","219","6","12"

It left me on an emotional journey and at 9 o'clock on a Friday night, feeling so saddened. While I sat alone by my computer, I realised I had given love to two fictional characters while I sat here with no one. Their love was not mine, but I had it for a brief moment. In the course of giving up my life, i gave two others love for awhile.\n\nIf you want to feel loved, buy this game. It will leave you feeling lonely but loved as you finish the game. You may have no one, but at least you let two others have love. For that lonely Friday night - I felt loved. And I never want that feeling to depart, so i just keep playing again and again, as if I'm watching my ex living out her life without me, when all I want is her back.","August 23, 2014","true","6.0"," 130 of 193 people (67%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","67","130","193","30","15"

If you're into games where you have to manage stats and you try to get the girl - then you'll like this game. No, it doesn't have nudity and it doesn't need too. This is more of a tragic romance, where you'll end up learning more about each character and really falling in love with them. This could easily have been spun out into a short novel, that's how good the storytelling is.\n\nIt's short, you can probably finish a playthrough in a couple of hours, but it has some replayability. This is an Indie company, so while $14.99 might seem like a lot, it's not if you just think of it like going to a movie. A movie is a few hours, ticket prices are nearly that much and you still enjoy that. At least with this game, you own it and can re-visit it if you like. Definite buy IF you like anime-style characters, tragic/heroic romances and life/dating sims.","May 18, 2014","true","11.2"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","23","25","0","0"

Leaning for no. If you're a fan of VNs (like me), this game will be worth your time; otherwise, I would look elsewhere.\n\nThe game promises you the ability to change the genre of the story, but the consequence of that is that too many different plot elements all seem to merge together into some kind of overwhelming mass, making the first playthrough very daunting. For all the directions the game can take, they don't see particularly refined. The result is a rather schizophrenic experience that can leave various threads unresolved, even with subsequent playthroughs. This game DOES improve with replays, and there are definitely elements of the story I really like (especially concerning Alex and Rina), but it requires significant investment to dig that up.\n\nThe stat-raising element of the game also disrupts the pacing of the game significantly. I found that I was grinding up knowledge or stats quite a bit in anticipation of something, anything to happen. The plot takes a backseat to however you intend to break it, and it doesn't really flow. This makes replays something of a chore, and the UI isn't well suited for that.\n\nThis is the first product of Sakura River and it offers a lot of potential for where they're going. I look forward to seeing more of what they produce in the future.","September 6, 2014","false","5.5"," 49 of 72 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","49","72","3","8"

I played the game, beat it and even enjoyed it, honestly.  However:\n\nThe art style is pretty dated for what it is and felt pretty simple.  It was pretty, but I've played a number of VN's that\nwere much prettier.  6/10\n\nThe story had moments that were touching and was overall very relatable for the most part.  It was also rather simplistic and carried almost no twists or surprises.  There was *one* thing that I guessed incorrectly about at the very end.  Don't mistake this as being impressive, since the game only has 5 4 characters that you, the main character ever interacts with.\nSo it being easily predictable is pretty much a given. 4/10\n\nMusic is alright at first, it's gets rather monotonous since there is very little change or variety.  I never reached the point where I hated it, but it didn't exactly add much to the game at all, either.  5/10\n\nThe gameplay elements are also pretty simple.  Money quickly ceases being a concern with just a little fore-thinking and the right plan.  At the end, you are still chided for "not having enough, and maybe needing to work on that" by the game though.  Despite the fact that I could have bought every ingame asset with money to spare.\n\nCombat is sort of interesting.  There are only something like 5 or 6 monster types though, so you will cycle through them all very quickly.  They just get stronger over time as you lvl up etc.  With a little work, you are also essentially invincible, so it's just a matter of wearing them down from your overly abundant, easily *re-fueled magic reserves.  So, stupidly easy.  4/10\n\nI enjoyed the game for the most part.  I beat it with very little effort and it only took as long as it did because I deleted my first play through due to the common black screen problems.  Reinstalling fixed nothing.  Thankfully they are not widespread and don't harm the game overly much.\n\nOverall, Fading Hearts is a 5/10 for me.  I can't in good conscience suggest it to people.  If you find a sale where it's $5 or less, consider maybe buying it.  Your time would be better spent with the plethora of freely translated VN's you can find elsewhere.

Characters don't develop so much as they suddenly jump from spot to spot on their arc, with no progression, they're just suddenly there, and some parts(specifically anything involving receiving a text message) are just broken, and don't display at all.  For all that there's supposed to be conversation trees, there is almost no choice when it comes to actual conversations.  Also, while the RPG mechanics are interesting, they're also very incomplete, as you are lacking anything to indicate level progression.\n\nRE: Developer response\nThe storyline goes on with or without the player?  I would have visited the characters in question every day if I had the option, but I wasn't given the option. Story arcs just plain vanish literally the next time I see the character in question.  Also  If you're going to have the story continue with or without the character, you really really REALLY need to reflect that in the in-game writing("What happened to him?  Oh right, you weren't there.  He got arrested/shot/broke up/won an award for community service/whatever").  Neither you, nor your character should know what happened off screen, so it's annoying when your character knows more about the story than you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/duszynski/recommended/259720/","duszynski","A Star in Darkness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/duszynski/","155 products in account","This is a spoiler-free review.\n\nThis is a type of game that seems to have people that either really like it or just straight-up hate it. There's also a lot of curious people that want to know if the game is worth getting, so rather than just tell you "Oh yeah, I like this!" I'm going to list all of the various things a person may like or dislike about the game.\n\nFirst of all, this is NOT a visual novel. This is a simulation game mixed with RPG elements. A visual novel is a game in which you only point and click to get story to continue. This is NOT that kind of game. It becomes a simulation game when there are stats to alter and daily choices to be made. It infuriates me that so many people called this a visual novel, when it's obviously a simulation game. Since you can go into a turn-based battle with HP & MP, level up, use a sword or magic, that's the part that's RPG-like. Although, I definitely wouldn't call this an RPG, since the battling is definitely not the focus of the game. In fact, you don't have to step foot in a battle if you don't want to. You can progress the story without participating in battle.\n\nIs this a dating sim? I believe so. I've seen others argue that it isn't, but I would say *it is* mainly because the only good endings you can get require you to have a good romantic relationship with a girl. There are only two girls to choose from, by the way.\n\nHow's the storyline? The best word I'd give the storyline is that it's rather odd. This isn't to say that it's a bad storyline, but in all honesty, I find the plot to be a bit weird. I've only gotten 4 endings out of the possible 10, so the storyline could be explained more if I get more endings, but they don't seem to explain the "weirdness" of the storyline very well. For some people, this isn't a problem though.\nOtherwise, the story involves getting to know one of (or both) of the girls that the main character knows. There are also two optional characters one can interact with, but they're strictly platonic.\nThe main goal of the story is to save Claire. Yes, Claire is one of the two girls you can be romantically involved with, but you must save her regardless of which girl you choose, otherwise you'll get a bad ending. Save her from what? That would be giving away spoilers.\n\nHow are the battles? Too easy, honestly. All one has to do is learn enough spells, and a person can very, very easily survive battles without much effort. In fact, you could learn ALL of the spells before even entering into your first battle, and you're pretty much guaranteed to win. As I mentioned earlier, there's HP, MP, basic attack (with a sword), and magic. It is turn-based, like any old-fashioned JRPG. There are times while in battle that certain mechanics of it don't make sense. For instance, if an enemy casts a shield on itself, it also casts a shield on the main character. I think this was a mistake in the game design, not intentional.\n\nHow long does one playthrough take? It's really only the first playthrough that should take a while. My first playthrough took about 5 or 6 hours. Of course, I read all of the dialogue. If you were to skip the dialogue, it would probably only take you an hour or two. If you're a fan of story (which I'm not sure why you wouldn't be if you're playing a game that's heavily focused on story), it's only long the first playthrough, because after that, you can skip any *already read* dialogue. There's also the option to skip all dialogue regardless of whether you've read it or not, but that seems like a rather silly thing to do.\n\nAre there walkthroughs for this game? Yes, but the only ones I've ever found were incomplete. I suggest doing a Google search to find various walkthroughs if you really want tips on how to get through the game. Some walkthroughs have given false information though, so be careful about which ones you choose to follow.\nIt's difficult to write a walkthrough for this game, because of the high randomization of events. Two different people playing the game could make the *exact* same choices, but end up experiencing events on different dates in the game. Basically, the games event mechanics are not set to specific dates. You, the gamer, have to trigger them yourself through either persistence or mere chance.\nWhat do I mean by "persistence"?  For example, the forest where your battles can take place has certain events within it. If you want those events to happen more quickly, then you need to keep exploring it over and over again until it triggers. However, if you're a patient person, you could just wait for it to happen by chance by exploring the forest every once in a while or something. Each time you explore the forest, the game randomly generates either a battle, a personal daydream of the main character's, or an event. Battles are the most frequent. Thus, you can have about a dozen battles before ever randomly getting an event or you could simply "luck out" and get an event straight off.\n\nIs there any "ecchi" or nudity? Nope. Not even a little bit.\n\nI think I've covered all the stuff most people ask/wonder about this game. I hope it helps the curious/unsure people about whether or not to get the game.","February 9, 2014","true","13.3"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","18","30","0","0"

There was mediocre art and sound, and sure, making a lot of decisions is great, but I would prefer the length of If My Heart Had Wings, but with the amount of decisions you make in this game. This game was somewhat short, so all the decisions made portrayed it to be just super forceful, as opposed to letting story take a more primary role. Overall, I would only recommend this because it shows us a different take on visual novels.\n\n5.5/10","January 1","true","10.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I've personally built up a healthy (that's questionable) tolerance to high-school anime tropes, so being able to see past that and get into the game I've found its actually pretty interesting and kind of innovative (I'm sure there's other VNs that have elements seen in this game, but the way they're put together in this game works really really well) .\n\nDealing with stuff like managing your time: keeping your friends and support network relationships healthy while finding time to earn a paycheck, get swole, prep for upcoming combat, etc. and the entire time people aren't being completely forthcoming with you so you're actively trying to figure out which characters are trying to manipulate you and why. It's pretty intriguing for what it is. While at work or nurturing a friendship or training for something, prioritizing an important task or project can sometimes inadvertently cause another important thing to fail catastrophically, so it becomes a pretty challenging juggling act.\n\nAnyway, game is VERY "anime".

If you are completely new to these types of games, keep reading. If you aren't, scroll down a bit. (There's also a TL;DR for both types.)\n\nFirst and foremost- if you think this is an eroge, it is not. It doesn't even have fanservice. Those of you are opposed to such AO content may now be able to give it a chance.\n\nSecondly, if you've never played any visual novel before, and are on the fence about ever trying, this game may put you off. It complicates the traditional choice-making system by adding a light grind-based RPG combat system (whose difficulty just goes out the window once you command magic,) and a bar-filling "work" system wherein the character spends time coding for disposable income.  Thus, if you want to not have to play rpg-lite on every playthrough, you may want to find other VNs.\n\nThat being said, this game's entire style leans towards what VNs can be found coming out of Japan. If you've played Magical Diary, Long Live the Queen, and Cherry Tree High Comedy Club, know that the whole feel of the game will be different, even if the genre is largely the same. If you like the style, then you'll like VNs in general.\n\nSo, for those of you who have never played VNs before, know that I recommend it, but be aware of the needless bar-filling.\n\n---\nIf you are new to these kinds of games, you can stop reading now. The rest is for people who have played a number of VNs before. Or be my guest and keep reading; I'm not your parent.\n\n-Presentation:  The art is good. It's clean and works well for its purpose. The characters are nicely done and the backgrounds are fine. Be aware there are only a handful of CGs, and no options to view them again from the main menu, as is traditional. The music is fine, if a bit repetitive, but provides the atmosphere needed to read in peace. Again, there isn't a jukebox to access from the main menu, but none of the music I remember liking so much to listen to it again. 7/10.\n\n-Story: Listen, I'll be honest with you- this game skirted around a really awesome idea that it never brought to the forefront. To be fair, you may not even understand what I'm talking about until your second or third run through, but when you do, you'll also go "aww, man." Putting that aside, there are about five or six actual endings, not including the ones where you just "flip the switch" at the end and get different flavortext. There are two heroines (don't bother going for anyone else, even though they do have a subplot) and, interestingly enough, there are ~35 manga books you can read that give a backstory of a world with magic and the adventures of people within them. There is a single good twist that isn't give to you unless you understand it first - one of the gems in this piece for sure. Unfortunately, in one of the routes there is an antagonist that is never seen, and on top of that, the choices you make to complete it and save her can be largely paralled to just ignoring the bad guy entirely. In short, it's no KEY visual novel, but It does okay. 7/10 for one route, and 5/10 for the other. 6.5/10 for the backstory.\n\n-Choice: There are only two heroines, so that limits your choices right there. Like most VNs this game has branching plot choices but after finishing the game for good I can tell you that they don't have as much of an effect on earning better endings. You'll actually find that leveling up in general is worthless past lv 4 because once you get magic you wreck faces sideways. In fact, combat is largely unnecessary; it is barely needed in one route and completely not in another. You'll also find moneymaking to be mostly unnecessary- at no point in the game are you forced to spend money, but you do need it to buy manga that gives you magic spells (which you should get). If you're on the way to a bad ending in the "no magic" route you'll get plenty of warning. In fact, getting a bad ending actually takes some serious neglect, not necessarily bad choices.\n\n-In short, if you have a lot of experience with VNs and have a picture of Jun Maeda on your wall, you may want to pass this over.\n-----\n\nTL;DR - Try the game if you're on the fence and have little or no experience with visual novels.

I think it gives you too much time to train your skills because the final boss was super easy ( plus other monsters in the game were WAY harder than the final boss ). Game only took me five hours to beat in two sittings to complete the story once. There are multi-endings so the game can be longer if you wish to get more out of the game. Mostly you don't get a lot of choices other than where to go and what you want to do at home. I wish there was more freedom to choose more things because I feel very limited to what I can or can not do. The artwork was very nice and the PS system was a cool thing. I kinda wish the game was a lot longer.. because for how short the game was for me I felt like it should have been a five dollar game. I really thought the game was cute though :).

Back to the topic. It's not good: choises are too simple and predictable and RPG elements... sorry, to sad for continue. But you catch the point. Too poor, too monotonous. Like the chess, where you have only four pawns on the board. Still playable, but not much fun.\n4. Story - that the worst part. It's just boring. That's all.

The writing isn't that great and the overall gameplay suffers too. It offers too much too many variables and as such it feels like it has no real focus and I felt no real desire to complete it, though I did twice just to see if either girl's story made me like this VN more.\n\nWhile it isn't terrible, Fading Hearts just isn't very good. There are plenty of better visual novels out there for free and the JRPG turn based combat sections don't increase the over all quality. In fact I found the fighting to be boring after few fights and in order to get one particular ending you have to do far more fighting than I honestly tolerated. Regardless I still did it and my reward was just another ending that felt somewhat weak.\n\nIf you really want to try this game I'd wait for it to be on sale.

However, I can't work up the desire or motivation to playthrough again for any alternate endings.\n\nAll the components are there--and more.  Fading Hearts has the potential to be a really awesome game, given the variety of elements incorporated.  I just felt like there was a disconnect amongst everything, that gaming aspects and even characters were not delved into nearly enough before you reached an ending.  Why do you have to focus on one particular aspect at the expense of others?  Why are some aspects virtually worthless to develop?  Yes, I know there's supposed to be the whole replayability factor, but I find myself viewing a replay as just tedious.  I would have preferred a longer, more in-depth playthrough where all the different aspects (whether it's the rpg elements, the work, the training, the dating) were better connected and necessary.  I mean when only a handful of the manga are worth reading as far as character development. . .\n\nFor me, development and disconnect were also huge problems with the characters.  I want to be immersed in a world, invested in the charaters.  I ended my first playthrough not even really caring or even knowing much of anything about the Ryou.  All the rest of the supporting cast just seemed like sidenotes on repeat.  I don't know if it's this way with every playthrough, but rather than further developing characters, conversations just kept rehashing the same things.  I learned barely anything about anyone.  In fact, I probably knew as much about Tracy, the maid at the Cosplay restaurant, as I did about the more significant characters.\n\nThat development and disconnect issue carried over to the story itself.  Storylines that seemed significant at the beginning would just fizzle and disappear.  Then bam!  Here's a new shocking revelation--but there's virtually no explanation to the what, when, why, where, how questions.  But lets throw in some manga that's supposed to somehow be connected with no explanation of how it is connected, and hey, the future you (who we also have no clue as to why/what) will have a few conversations with you and disappear.\n\nSome of the other issues are related to style.  Too many typos for a professional game.  Some odd wording/odd writing.  And the black screens.  Every time you read manga, the story displays itself as weird, stencilled script across a plain, black backdrop.  And there's a lot of manga you can read.  I won't even get into the manga writing, but how can you have text only manga?\n\nSo basically, when a major character apparently is killed off, and you just think "huh" and "oh well," then go searching the internet to see if anyone can shed light on the fragmented storyline you just played through--well, it's time to find a different game.","March 29, 2014","false","4.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Just like all the other big ones (Juniper's Knot, Katawa Shoujo, etc.) You read through the story and at certain points you have to make a choice. These choices have a certain effect on the story itself and make for a unique experience.\n\nThe writing is good and interesting. There're some failures in grammar, but they aren't that disturbing. But, one thing that IS disturbing are bugs that make you miss parts of the story. Maybe they're important, maybe they aren't. No matter what they're, it's disturbing, because it makes you feel left of the middle.\n\nBut, to be honest, Fading Hearts is of an acceptable length, it's written in a nice way and the story and characters are deep enough to keep you interested.\n\nPrice and quality are okay for this game, as are the graphics and music.\nI would say that Fading Hearts is a nice addition to the Steam Visual Novel Library.","February 7, 2014","true","3.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

In Fading Hearts, though, the communication is mostly one-way - most of the time you watch and read, and occasionally make a choice. It took me around 20 minutes of scrolling through animations and text boxes, until I got my first choice, and that is only to have the game throw at me more and more information.\n\nObviously, I'm disappointed, as I was expecting more to do. Despite my disappointment, though, I'm not rating this game down, since it was completely my fault, that I didn't get what I wanted. I should've done some reading before buying something I had thought was something else. I just figured I'd post something about it, so others wouldn't make that mistake.

It is nice to see games in this style being sold in Western markets, but regrettably this is not a particularly good example of the genre.  The story and characters are engaging, and have some depth, although the writing is mediocre (a real problem when the entirety of the game is read off the screen).\n\nThe real killer, however, is that the game is very poorly coded -- important events happen off-screen, without the player's involvement; interactions with characters reference events you have not experienced; and endings occur regardless of their triggers being hit (or not hit, as the case may be).\n\nThis game has a great concept, but its execution falls terribly short of the mark.  I wouldn't expect these errors in a free title, let alone a $15 game.  I do look forward to seeing future work from Sakura River -- possibly even a complete version of this title -- but I can't recommend this game to anyone but serious visual novel junkies looking for a fix, and even they are likely to be disappointed.","February 16, 2014","false","5.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Don't trust anything any character says, everyone lies at some point.\n2. You can change the genre of the game by your own choices.\n\nIt fails on the first one because the game's central plot-driving story element is something you, the Main Character, are told about but never directly see. You're supposed to accept it unreflectively as the main premise of the entire story. This contradicts the emphasis on not believing everything the other characters say.\n\nIt fails on the second in that the non-dating sim elements of stat management and RPG battles feel tacked on and ultimately unnecessary. They're pointless at best, and repetitive at worst.\n\nFading Hearts is just too ambitious. It tries to do too much, and what is there is not well executed. It just comes off as lacking in focus.

The chracters are pretty lifeless except one who you disappears after a certain point(ironic because that's when my interest went away) There's parts of the story you can't experience unless you spend a lot of time with at a certain area(It's bad either way Game Design wise and Story wise) Also there's a lot of talk of CHOICES and I only got like 2 in my entire playthrough.\n\nOverall I wouldn't recommend this game at all. It's not very fun and it's challenge to get through for a unrewarding payoff.","June 16, 2014","false","5.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

It is really short (~4 hours of gameplay). This is a game that you're not killing enemies or chasing after bad guys. There is a story and you just make decisions. This type of games are so popular in Japan but, actually that one is not a good example of its kind.\n\nIn game you are a guy (Ryou) that lives a normal life, go school, hang out with friends, and make decisions about your life. Your decisions directly manuplate the story which you will see.\n\nArt of game is, um.. terrible. Most of the game you always see same places and same guys. There is nothing that makes you feel surprised in the story. Music is OK I think. Most of music made by piano, not that good but average. Animations and sound effects are not good.\n\nIf you got $14,99 to spend nothing important, feel free to buy this game. Yeah, I vote as 'positive' because there is no game like this.\n\nI don't think I will play again and again.

There also seems to be a lot of bugs, glitches, and confusion about how to actually complete the damn thing.\n\nThey've added stat building elements, magic and combat (all RPG elements) into a game that also tries desperately to be a dating sim and visual novel. Very difficult to micro manage things and get what needs to be done accomplished. It was okay my first time through just focusing on the story and on which girl I'd rather date, but after I tried to go for all the endings and get into the complexity of the game, that's when it got frustrating. Balancing working, reading, training, relaxing, dating, socializing.. it's just too much.\n\nNobody can seem to agree on how to reach certain endings or get certain achievements. The newer version of the game didn't seem to fix these issues either. You can be on multiple ending tracks at once, and some endings completely contradict one another.. which is insanely frustrating. This game is riddled with all sorts of inconsistances and it makes me just not want to go through the effort of TRYING to finish it.\n\nThe front page advertises about one of the unique features being that characters can lie to you and that it's supposed to add some sort of mystique to the game and somehow be game changing. This is not the case at all. It feels nothing like that. I've played several times, picking each dialogue option to see the differences (if any), and really.. there are none.\n\nI've played many a visual novel and this one just doesn't have a lot of characteristics that make a good one. The story is interesting, but nothing special. Your two love interests aren't all that interesting in the slighest. Choices seem to matter very little. Endings do not have a clear cut set of directions to follow in order to achieve them. Music is acceptable. I just can't really justify recommending this game for all of these reasons.\n\nThe devs really should have decided whether they wanted this game to be an RPG, a dating sim or a visual novel.. but not a bad combination of all three.","April 15","false","4.2"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

So, as you can see, when I WAS playing it, it was extremely good. But then I got stuck in the loop, so that was annoying. But I perservered and tried everything I could to get unstuck. That involved going to the forest (I had forgotten there was a bunch of stuff to do there with the Magical Girl, Mystica) And so I kept doing a bunch of stuff with her until she said the thing about ♥♥♥♥ing "evil alien from space." I lost my ♥♥♥♥. So now, not only was I stuck in a loop, but now there's ♥♥♥♥ing aliens? Magic is one thing, but aliens are A WHOLE other thing. I mean, seriously? I can't be the ONLY one that thought that it was a bit out there (literally). So then I went on the forums to check for a solution to the loop, only to be told the ending by someone who can't say 'Spoiler Alert'. So now I know the ending, and none of the stuff that LEADS UP TO IT. I'm pretty much done with this game now, because there is no reasons left to play it. *THIS IS WHERE I BEGIN TO COMPLIMENT IT AGAIN* It was a VERY good concept, and a joy to play at first, but when the spoilers and the other bizzare stuff came, that was where I drew the line. I even loved the little stories it told when he went to sleep (The one about the prince, the researcher, etc.) Those were great and full of thought. The visuals were pretty amazing for a visual novel. I mean, EVERYTHING was good about it, except when I got caught in the loop, that just made the mood bad, then when I finally figured something out, I got rewarded with some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about aliens. And then another loop? And then a SPOILER? I was pretty much at my limit with anger at that point. Yeah, no thanks. But I can't stress ENOUGH how good it was before all of the strange stuff started happening (The magic stuff was fine). But then it all just went downhill really fast. But there is sooooo much potential for this game to be soooooo good, but... ah, you get the picture by now.\n-END OF HUGE EDIT-\n\n-ORIGINAL REVIEW-\nThis game is EXCELLENT. Now, I would like to quickly establish that I'm no stranger to visual novels, so I would like to think that counts for something when I say that this is exceptional in every way for a game that is still being updated. Now just a few pointers (Not requests, just some things I noticed). A few spelling mistakes that could use some fixing. Also, maybe have, like 1 or 2 alternate casual costumes for the caracters, because it's a bit awkward when you see the same character in the same clothes for days on end :P And I'm saying CASUAL clothes, not the uniforms, because obviously those have to stay the same. But seriously, AMAZING work with this, and I hope to see it go even farther than it has now! Keep up the good work devs!\n-END OF ORIGINAL REVIEW\n\n-Edit-\nAlso, I noticed a slider for voice volume. I know it's not up to me, but oh please don't implement voices. It just makes things so awkward. I may be the only person that thinks that though.\n\n-Another Edit- (There is sort of an edit to this in my very top paragraph) I am also stuck in a loop. At night, the 'Call Someone' option is there, but nobody is available to call. Also, Sophia won't say anything to me anymore, and I'm just out of options to progress the story. This may be a bug, or I may be a ♥♥♥♥♥.","June 21, 2014","false","6.2"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

(because I love them!)\nBut.. Fading Hearts had SO much potential!\nIt did just never used it...\n\nOkay so let me get this straight:\nI liked the idea of being able to make choices through the daily life so you could become stronger or earn more money. And that if you planned your moves correctly you'd be able to reach your goals without being too stressfull and on the same time be "social".\nBut not the fact that there is only TWO girls that you can interact with. (and you can barely interact with them)\nThe story is simply too short to only have two girls in it!\nYou don't get enough time to develop anything with them and the endings is basically only based on simple choices...\n\nThere is a few "secrets" that will give the story a little "push" or give you a few more moments to think about what you're doing but they don't even affect the main storyline.\n\n(SPOILERS.. Kinda)\nIn the end of the story where a "bunch" of magic-stuff happens VERY fast (I'm talking two plot-twist's in a row). There is this "final fight" where you would think that you would have to be a high lvl anything to actually beat this thing. But no.\nI didn't really make any progress in any of the training-things and I only learned one spell but I still beated the crap out of that thing.\nAnd after that I got one more choice to a good end and that was just... Just... Just THAT.\nThe ending did absolutely nothing to me because it was just "what now?".\nThe reasons why it wasn't special is that there was a huge lack of character development...\n\nAnother thing that pisses me off about this VN is all the "dreams/visions/hallucinations/daydreams" whatever you call them..\nThey show up when you're resting, exploring or sleeping and they do NOTHING for the story..\nI don't know if this is a cheap trick to add more reading to the storyline but one thing is for sure:\nThese little "side-stories" doesn't matter. The only thing they do is sometimes add a little + on your personal strenght (which you need for some reason that hasn't been clear enough to me because the conversations doesn't seem to change either way)\n\nSo buy this game if you need to try something different for a change..\nBut don't buy it with high hopes of something EXTRORTUNARY.\nI'd personally rate it 3.9/10","July 13, 2014","false","10.0"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","0"

I picked it up expecting a weirdo multigenre choose your own adventure story, but was instead treated to an unimaginative, honest-but-half-♥♥♥♥♥ attempt at, uh, something. My biggest complaint about the game is the writing. It's very, very bad. So bad, in fact, that I thought the game was a weird meta joke for an hour or so because the primary mechanic behind the 'combat' in the game involves learning magic powers from manga.\n\nAlso, you're a high school student whose parents have died, but luckily you're a genius programmer who has to make tough, decisions between coding for an indy game that doesn't pay very well or collapsing the world economy by not helping an IT worker. It's really bananas and I'd definitely click the reccomend button if this costed a dollar and didn't describe itself as a game that adapts itself to your decisions.\n\nHere's a non-spoilery description of what your decisions affect: One of two of the anime high school girls will kiss you. One of the anime girls has an abusive boyfriend and you spend the first half of the game trying to figure out a way to get her to love you instead. The other girl is in love with you but to understand why she can't love you now you have to go fight monsters in the forest.\n\nThis game is terrible in a cool way, because it's sort of a sublime interpretation of what it is. It's aggressively dumb, but in a way that you can almost see every hilarious piece of the author's inadvertent self-awareness puzzle.\n\nBuy this game if you want to laugh or to break up an anime girl from her abusive boyfriend by making decisions like talking to her about it or passive aggressively not talking to her about it while getting dating tips from your asexual otaku love-sensei.","April 26, 2014","false","2.1"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","0"

Why? tl;dr because it's a mess.\n\nLet's sum up the gameplay, before I get to the actual story.\nThere's so much stuff to do. The most important thing is, you can click to skip all of the boring walls of text and there really is a ton of them (75% of the game's text) and they have absolutely no meaning besides being annoying. Once in a while, you will have some dreams about magic and other epic stuff, although nobody in the game tells you why you're having the dreams (not even your "I" from alternative dimension) and what's actually happening. Oh, and the dreams make no sense whatsoever. Did you want a game with a satisfying, fun story? Then stop reading here.\n\nYou can read manga to learn some spells, but instead of just writing "You have learnt Cast Diarrhea spell", it reads part of some story. Those stories are boring and irrelevant to the main story line, so just skip through them.\nYou can work for three companies, but you don't really need the money, since there's not much stuff to buy. It's somewhat relevant to story, but the only difference between working and not working is that in the end it writes "You helped saving this company" or "You ruined this company". Yeah.\nYou can work out to make yourself stronger, but there's no point since you don't need to fight at all during the whole playthrough.\nYup, there's some "fighting". It's the well-know "click this ability to cast diarrhea" or "click this to attack". You can fight, but you don't have to. OH GAWD THE DECISIONS!!!\n\nAs for decisions, there're about 10 opportunities to choose from several (usually two) options and somehow change the story. The most game-changing decision for me was whether to choose strawberry or green tea jelly.\n\nWorking - pointless. Working out - pointless. Reading - pointless. Fighting - pointless. That's why I said it's a mess, in the beginning. There's a lot of stuff, but nothing works well.\nAnyway, sooner or later you will just end up spamming left mouse button clicks\n\nThe writing is poor while the story idea is decent. It's full of cliché, the game was not made by Japanese people, but it tries really hard to look like a Japanese game. There's lot of talking about anime and manga stuff, there's some cosplay caffe and tea house. So it's pretty much Japan. BUT it's not. The story actually takes place in the "Trident City" (I think) in the Soroyuma country (?, Eh.. I don't even remember the names anymore, sorry). But yeah, still Japan.\n\nOh, one more thing. The game ends quite suddenly. I was having my usual work out rutine, then I went to sleep. I woke up, went somewhere outside the city and then the game ended. No explanation, nothing.\nIf you want to see the "quality" of the writing, go watch a video.\n\nAs for graphics, there're around 10-15 background images (=locations). That's not a lot. The characters sometimes change facial expressions and body language, but that doesn't make me like the game much more.\nI had to turn the music off after some time, it gets rather annoying. Every tune keeps playing in a loop and they're not very original neither. I also tend to take "alt+tab" breaks while playing games like this and I'd probably go nuts within 10 minutes if I'd have to listen to that stuff over and over again.\n\nSo that's enough for cons, now some pros.\nThe main story is decent and the game tries to make you replay it. And you probably will do so. All in all, it's quite short (2 hours-ish), but some decisions actually affect the story thus making the game replay-able. Will you talk to this person, or never meet her again? Will you try to save this person or forget her? Will you get to know this person or ignore her?\nThat's the good stuff about the game, I just don't understand why there has to be so much pointlessness in this game.\n\nCharacters are somewhat likeable. They all have some secrets, which makes them interesting and makes you want to progress further in the story.\nI don't really like the magic stuff and the way the game handles it, but I guess it's acceptable.\nThe story itself isn't that much original, but the decisions and possibilities are what makes you want to play.\n\nI'll do another playthrough and see if it changes my opinion about the game. I might edit my review if it does.\n\nSummary:\n- It's a mess, but it's still playable.

The decisions are what makes you "want" (/suffer) to play and possibly re-play the game\n- Graphics and music are mediocre\n- Other aspects than the story are pointless and just serve as gametime "fillers"\n\nAll in all, the concept of the game is decent.

The cast reflexs the stereotypical, overly mysogynistic tendicies we all know and love (read: hate) from Japan, all of the women require the man to fix the issues, and to top it all off, the writing is about on par with what my 6 year old nephew is doing in preparation for a "story telling competition" he's entering.

Just keep in mind that the game will be short. (avg: 4 hours) It's just sad that there aren't more VN's on Steam. (besides: Long Live the Queen) In my opinion if you are the type of person that wants more bang for their buck (meaning hours of playtime), I say don't get this game.\n\nIF you are NOT into VN or it's your first time I say wait till the game goes on sale or wait till it comes to an indie bundle.

That is unless you are like me and squeeze every last bit of a game's 'valued' cost in order to get back its moneys worth.\n\nOut of all the endings, only about three of them are worth playing through. Other reviewers claim that the game is a highly intricate, interactive rpg-style simulation, but truthfully it's not so much different than a regular indie rpg game or dating sim; probably a few notches worst.\n\nMost of the events are predetermined and are based on the limited selection of options made by everyday decisions. Rather, the interactions are quite bland at best and the action & adventure aspect drastically dulls after the tenth battle of the same-looking monster.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're looking for an extremely cheap-thrilled visual novel worth 5-10 hours of your time (possibly less), this may be your game. Just know that the story length is very short, and the story itself isn't what you'd call pulitzer prize-winning material. If you do decide to buy the game, get ready as you'll probably be spending more time pressing the skip button and reading white words off a black screen, than anything else.\n\nWorth the $15?

That's the first thing about it. That's a fact. You read a lot and leftclick/spacebar a lot.\nSo let's go through a bit of what this game prides itself with:\n\n"Almost EVERY NPC LIES to you at some point in the game!"\nThis sounds good, doesn't it? A game where you need critical thinking, good decisionmaking, some sense of distrust? Sorry to disappoint, but that is not what this game is. Yes, almost every NPC lies to you at some point in the game. But some of these are really not noteworthy. Example: (Spoiler)\nClaire has a boyfriend that is obviously abusive towards her, yet she claims there is no truth to this\nObviously, it's a lie, but the typical way the character acts makes it obvious and really just one of the usual "convince the character to talk to you" things.\n\nHow do you figure out who to trust and not trust?\nYet again, it sounds like you would have characters set up "traps" or something like that, like helping them and they would ditch you, but yet again, that is not the case. I literally went through the game being nice to everybody and it worked out just fine. No problems. Got the good ending, got happy, got home.\n\nFading Hearts is a game that goes a step further than other visual novels by giving you choices that affect the ending, and pretty much the ability to decide what you want to do while the story unfolds, even though there's not that many daily-life options to actually choose from, and I found myself waiting for the next storypart a lot and just spending time somewhere in the meanwhile.\n\nI want to emphazise again, the game is not bad, it is a good visual novel, it does offer choice. There is nothing to say about that. The main two things I have a problem with are:\n\n-  The Genre changes with your decisions. This one might be right. I have to play through it multiple times to judge that. But I would have liked some more "visible" impact from the decisions you make, as in, "directly", something where I can say "huh, I did that. Now that's why this happens." Sadly, in the gameplay I did (aka happy fun times), this doesn't happen. But like I said, not judging on this yet.\n\n- Now, to my main problem: There is, in my opinion, waaaaay too much emphasis on the fact that you shouldn't trust everyone. You get that thrown at you multiple times during the gameplay, mainly in the beginning and on the shop page. I was expecting something like "Zero Escape: Virtue's last reward" in a way. Characters where you think you could trust them, but then they might ditch you, even when you're good friends with them, so you go back to your savepoint and behave different, see what happens, try to use your knowledge from past gameplays to "control" the scene a bit. This is really my main flaw here. You can just go through the entire game with being nice with everyone. I wouldn't advertise my game with "EVERY NPC LIES TO YOU" if it's really nothing noteworthy if you're just being nice all day to them.\n\nI'm gonna thumbs up the game, for what it is and the fact that I enjoyed playing through it, but everyone should think through what exactly they want from this game before they buy it.","January 10, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Part of the premise is that Y2K caused a huge catastrophe. As someone that remembers Y2K and works as an engineer , I thought this was charming (esp. since I know first hand how dumb engineers can be). However, this rustled a lot of feathers for quite a few people. And it's great that it does because the setting in the game world can vary from being japan-as-seen-in-anime to being why-the-****-not-istan.\n\nA generic anime world is the baseline for how weird & cliche this game can get, but the upside is that the game can become a mystery, a fantasy, a love story or a software-engineering-simulator. That's what makes the game great and as a side effect, the world is pretty off the wall. I loved it!","January 11, 2015","true","35.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While others engross you in a linear story, this game takes the 'well, it's shorter, but there are multiple endings' route. There are a couple things that I like and dislike about the game.\n\n- It has a shallow battle system, which makes it feel like Persona at times. I personally think Persona gets way more credit than it deserves nowadays, but whatever. You can do things outside of battle to prepare yourself. Obviously this isn't the main dra of the game, and it's not that deep.\n- The endgame is way too sparse compared to the rest of the game. You'll go a week or two with rarely any scenes, and you'll start to wonder if the game broke or something. On the two playthroughs I've had, this has been a problem with both. I have heard that aspects of the game are randomized, so it may or may not be a serious problem. Maybe I was just really unlucky.\n- You get the sense that the developers quit early on this one. Not just because of the above, but you're marching along, thinking the story has a lot more life in it, and suddenly everything gets resolved in a series of events in a day or two. It just... ends. Abruptly.\n- I see people complaining of the writing, both the content and the grammar/spelling. I wonder if were playing the same game. I remember no grammar/spelling errors, and I don't have serious problems with the content. It is quite a mishmash of ideas, though, veering closely to the otaku. And some of them are just plain stupid or cliche. But largely, it's passable.\n- The developer makes too big a deal of everyone lying to you at some point. Yeah, everyone's keeping secrets... but that's par for the course in anime, really. It would have been more significant in my opinion if you were able to guess what these lies were before their reveals, but the twists are so far out there that you don't really get that chance.\n- The advertised genre changes have a bit more meat to them. Depending on what you want to do, you can either discover the core of the story (going into supernatural elements), or not bother to discover the character's true intentions and treat this as a life sim.\n\nI see this as $15 in the store now. Please wait until this is on sale. I think it's enjoyable, but not quite worth that price. There's a bunch of unused potential in the life sim part of this game, and I would pay attention to a spiritual successor.","January 22, 2015","false","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story itself is somewhat written by the player which is really cool in my opinion I think like half of it is forged by the player you don't actually have to write anything just make plenty of choses you make.  How the each choses you make could decide whether in the end you live or die in the end some choses are meaningles others could decide the fate of the people of the city you live in including your own. depending on what you choose to do this story could have some action in it or none at all, you could make your character a magic only fighter or a physical only fighter or a mix of both or not fight at all its your chose.\nOverall I'd give this VN a 8 out of 10.","September 19, 2014","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The writing is pretty good in general, and there's some really interesting multi-layered things going on in the story.  I found myself genuinely interested in giving it a second playthrough and exploring what differences are possible.\n\nThe beginning does drag, and the pacing is generally uneven, but a well-implemented skip feature means that you can skip familiar conversations and it will drop you out of skipping forward when there's a branch of story you might not have seen.

I'm so touched by how this game was made and how the characters like Ryou, Claire, and Rina make you want to believe it was real.

There are a few errors in the text, but its not that big of a deal. I think the biggest let down was the fact that at the beginning of the game, the two annoucer characters talk about people saying things in order to get what they want (largely paraphrased) and honestly I did not see too much of that. It was far too clear on what was going on, and giving that hint actually made it much easier. I also didn't really see how the choices exactly affected the outcome, but I think if I gave it a few more play throughs I could see it.

I guess playing games like Dracu Riot, which can be a 30-50 hour game, has left me alwasy wanting length in a vn, but I also think length in general allows for more story to be written.\n\nAs a final note, it is good to see a native English vn and I hope to see more in the future!","February 13, 2014","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fading Hearts as a VN game is confident, but that comes with some spelling errors. So if you’re a grammar N…Z or an English teacher, it’s not advisable to pickup and play this game. It could possibly drive you insane by the spelling mistakes in this game.\n\nAlso if by chance you’re picky on fictional settings and places not fitting in the logic of the real world then don’t pick this game up. But if you’re old enough to remember the ridiculous plots and plot holes of older Japanese VN games from the 80’s. Then you might have an idea what to expect as a back story plays out. In Fading Hearts Y2K led to a disaster which only affected one small nation in the whole world. That small nation is where our main catalog of characters in this game live. This leaves our main protagonist and his friends without parents because of the disaster which had befallen the small country of Sorayama.  Personally, I had to stop playing for a bit because I was laughing for a while after reading it.  But after getting my composure back I found out that I enjoyed Fading Hearts as a whole game.\n\nWith all that said, technically the game does everything VN games have done in the past and doesn’t really break that mold. That is not really a bad thing as VN games were always about how you discovered the world around you, but also the people you interacted with. That in itself, is what Fading Hearts does right, it gives you the ability to choose how you want to pursue your relationship with those characters’. As well as how your choices will affect the final ending of the game itself. So if you’re a relaxed person whom happens not to get too stuck up on a few spelling errors and an off the wall notion of the world Ryou lives in, give this game at least a shot.","July 10, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's the first thing about it. That's a fact. You read a lot and leftclick/spacebar a lot.\nSo let's go through a bit of what this game prides itself with:\n\n"Almost EVERY NPC LIES to you at some point in the game!"\nThis sounds good, doesn't it? A game where you need critical thinking, good decisionmaking, some sense of distrust? Sorry to disappoint, but that is not what this game is. Yes, almost every NPC lies to you at some point in the game. But some of these are really not noteworthy. Example: (Spoiler)\nClaire has a boyfriend that is obviously abusive towards her, yet she claims there is no truth to this\nObviously, it's a lie, but the typical way the character acts makes it obvious and really just one of the usual "convince the character to talk to you" things.\n\nHow do you figure out who to trust and not trust?\nYet again, it sounds like you would have characters set up "traps" or something like that, like helping them and they would ditch you, but yet again, that is not the case. I literally went through the game being nice to everybody and it worked out just fine. No problems. Got the good ending, got happy, got home.\n\nFading Hearts is a game that goes a step further than other visual novels by giving you choices that affect the ending, and pretty much the ability to decide what you want to do while the story unfolds, even though there's not that many daily-life options to actually choose from, and I found myself waiting for the next storypart a lot and just spending time somewhere in the meanwhile.\n\nI want to emphazise again, the game is not bad, it is a good visual novel, it does offer choice. There is nothing to say about that. The main two things I have a problem with are:\n\n-  The Genre changes with your decisions. This one might be right. I have to play through it multiple times to judge that. But I would have liked some more "visible" impact from the decisions you make, as in, "directly", something where I can say "huh, I did that. Now that's why this happens." Sadly, in the gameplay I did (aka happy fun times), this doesn't happen. But like I said, not judging on this yet.\n\n- Now, to my main problem: There is, in my opinion, waaaaay too much emphasis on the fact that you shouldn't trust everyone. You get that thrown at you multiple times during the gameplay, mainly in the beginning and on the shop page. I was expecting something like "Zero Escape: Virtue's last reward" in a way. Characters where you think you could trust them, but then they might ditch you, even when you're good friends with them, so you go back to your savepoint and behave different, see what happens, try to use your knowledge from past gameplays to "control" the scene a bit. This is really my main flaw here. You can just go through the entire game with being nice with everyone. I wouldn't advertise my game with "EVERY NPC LIES TO YOU" if it's really nothing noteworthy if you're just being nice all day to them.\n\nI'm gonna thumbs up the game, for what it is and the fact that I enjoyed playing through it, but everyone should think through what exactly they want from this game before they buy it.","January 10, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
