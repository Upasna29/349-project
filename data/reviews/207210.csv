If this HD remaster has "ruined" your childhood memories so much, please point me in the direction of what Tony Hawk games you were playing as children.\n\nI was quite wary of this HD remake, considering the negative reviews on Steam. Users claiming that this game is nothing but a failure with bad physics and sloppy game design. This game is exactly how I remember the original THPS franchise (with better graphics and some slight variations obviously), and I put a LOT of hours into those games in my teen years.\n\nThe controls are still weird and slightly hard to master, it's still difficult to tell if you're going to land something when you transition from a quarter pipe to the ground, and the newly implemented manuals (they weren't in the original THPS) still some times drop your combo instead of maintaining it.\n\nYes, THPS was a crappy game in the early 2000's and it's still a crappy game now, even with HD textures, new skaters, different advertisements and all. It hasn't aged well by any means. When it was first released, it was the first of its kind, so we thought it was amazing, but since then a plethora of skating games have come out.\n\nBut you know what? THPS is one of the best crappiest games I've ever played, and I have extremely fond memories of it when I was growing up. This HD remake simply updates the graphics, and it seems like people are mad that it's not a complete revamp of the game to bring it into the current control standards. For those of us who ACTUALLY remember the game, instead of just claiming that we do, this is an accurate and fun as hell re-release.\n\nRating: 4.0/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","January 6","true","4.1"," 288 of 349 people (83%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","83","288","349","29","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WampaCow/recommended/207210/","WampaCow","WampaCow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WampaCow/","125 products in account","In a day before games kept track of hours played, I'd estimate my time spent across the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (THPS) series in the 1000s of hours.  I fully completed and became proficient at games 1-8 in the series.  At the time, I thought 8 (the first entry on the PS3) was so poor that I couldn't bring myself to suffer through 9.  And then I played this disaster, which makes the constant issues/glitches in 8 feel like I was complaining about nothing.\n\nLet's cut right to the chase.  Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD is not the same game as the old THPS games.  The game was rebuilt from the ground up and does not feel like the old series.  While the PS2 iterations became progressively less inspired and lazy as the numbers climbed to 5, 6, 7, at least the game always FELT the same.  This feels totally different and the best way I can describe it is clunky.  I made an effort to max Tony Hawk's stats because I thought "maybe it feels like garbage because my stats are so low."  I got close, but could not bring myself to finish the task.  It was too frustrating.\n\nControls: there is no way to change them in-game and with a controller, they are slightly different than the old THPS games (see "reverts")\n\nReverts: This essential move, added in THPS3, is available via a DLC pack.  Okay, yes, it's stupid that it wasn't included in the original, but whatever.  That is not the main issue here.  Fans of the old games will remember that a revert is performed by pressing R2 as you land a vert trick.  The previously mentioned control change?  Now R2  also causes your skater to spin while in the air (I believe R1 did this in the past?  never used it).  Imagine this: every time you try to revert, you spin another 30-45 degrees, causing you to crash-land your vert trick.  It is difficult for me to put into words how frustrating this is.  And it happens CONSTANTLY.  How the developers could possibly think it's a good idea to have revert and mid-air rotate mapped to the same button is beyond me.  This issue alone makes the game unplayable.  There is a somewhat confusing .ini file you can edit to change key bindings, but as far as I can tell, revert and spin actions are one in the same, and cannot be separated.\n\nGrinds: In the THPS series, performing a grind/series of grinds speeds up your character.  This mechanic is not present here.  I used to trick around the map to collect objectives because it was faster, and fun.  In THPS HD, I found myself skating and avoiding everything because it slowed me down and I would inevitably run into some glitch that knocked me down.\n\nWall-rides: God... the frustration.  They are damn near impossible to do in this game.  Way harder than in THPS1 (which was not a great game for wall-rides).  I nearly heaved my PC out the window attempting to grind the 5 bells in the schoolyard.  Oh, and when you actually manage to get in a wall-ride, the result is inconsistent and wonky.\n\nDisplay: All controls displayed in the game are keyboard controls, even if you're using a controller.  So navigating menus and buying stats required either guesswork on the controller or reaching over to use the keybaord.  Not a huge issue, but it's sloppy.\n\nConstant Glitches: I only played the game a couple hours and encountered tons of issues.  I'd estimate about 5% of my falls would launch me high in the air and across the map.  Manuals after reverts do not work consistently.  One time I was stuck in a manual and could not get out by jumping.\n\nIf you've never played any of the old games, there is a chance you may enjoy this title, not knowing what you missed.  If you have played and enjoyed any of the previous iterations, stay far away, not matter how low the cost of this during a Steam sale.  It is like paying money to have someone punch you in the stomach and trample your dreams of a time when THPS games were fun.\n\n0/10","December 14, 2014","false","1.3"," 81 of 88 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","81","88","5","0"

I'm only an hour in, but I'm confident that's an accurate portrayal of the game.\n\nThis (with it's DLC) feels more or less like a mish-mash of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1, 2 and 3 with HD graphics.  If they had taken everything from these games and thrown it into one amazing release, it probably would've done better critically.  Instead they hand picked certain levels, hand picked certain skaters, lost a good chunk of the original soundtracks (mostly due to licensing issues), ditched the multiplayer found in the originals (local or online), ditched any kind of create-a-skater and called it a day.  It doesn't feel like the "complete" collection it could've been.  Like a greatest hits collection from a band that doesn't include all of their biggest songs, it's not really a game that needs to be in every THPS fans collection.\n\nNow, that doesn't necessarily mean the game is bad.  Lacking graphical options (outside of resolution) and wonky ragdolling aside, it plays exactly like a faithful HD rerelease should.  If you loved the games back in the PS1/N64 days, this will absolutely give you the THPS fix you've probably been craving.  (If you didn't or have "grown up" since then, it'll probably seem overly simple and dated.)  The game was always meant to be simple though.  Simple, but completely over the top... it's by no stretch of the imagination a juggernaut in modern physics.  You grind things you have no business grinding, you'll jump gaps that would put the Springfield Gorge to shame... but that was the fun of it... and it still is fun.  You'll still spend hours collecting SKATE, hidden tapes (DVD's), busting up bells around School II, making your way down the Downhill Jam.  Getting high, pro and sick scores.  And all the little challenges nested into each level, that you'll have to explore and find... unless, of course, you still remember where everything is.\n\nIf you can find it for a good price and wouldn't mind a quick nostalgic shot in the arm, I'd definitely say give it a shot.  Just know that it's not the "complete collection" that it could've been.","April 26, 2014","true","3.1"," 90 of 116 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","90","116","0","2"

However, after the seventh installement, the series went in idiotic directions with a pack-in skateboard that was worse than the Wii Balance Board. After 2 failed games that were playable with that board, Activision decided it was best to go back to the roots of the series. Remaking some of the levels of Tony Hawk 1 and 2 and packaging them together as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD. The idea is great, but they screwed it up.\n\nThe controls suck. I tried to play this game with a keyboard and with a controller, but both times the game did not feel as smooth as the originals did. There are a lot of glitches and the graphics are horrible. I also wondered why they didn't just remake every level instead of just a few.\n\nThis PC-port is the worst. You cannot change the keyboard controls, there are no video options to speak of, the resolution is not even Full HD and there is NO Multiplayer... really?? I grabbed the old Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 box for PC from my shelf and that version had Online Multiplayer... that was 1999.\n\nIf you're curious about the Tony Hawk series or you're a fan.. in either case, stay away.","February 15, 2014","false","3.6"," 99 of 135 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","99","135","0","5"

As someone who loves THPS 2-4, this game was a huge letdown. First of all, the controls are absolutely trash, and you CANNOT rebind them. They really should have just stuck to the THPS2 controls, as those felt absolutely fine, but here trying to do tricks just comes off as awkward. Second, they add some of the worst maps from THPS 1 & 2 (Mall, Downhill Jam, Venice Beach mainly). Third, reverts came in a DLC, which is unforgivable. Reverts are what made vert viable for combos past just ending them. Not adding them makes grab tricks almost useless. all of this, and the game doesn't even look that good, it looks like it could have been made 2007-2008.

The original THPS2 gameplay felt way better than this HD remakes gameplay. E.g. they somehow couldn't get proper nollie flips done. Basically you do a nollie but then the flip animation is the one of a regular flip trick. Although I undestand that this issue isn't noticable or bothering for many players, to me it is a major flaw. Especially if you consider that THPS2 already did its flip trick animations perfectly fine 12 years before this remake was made. I would choose playing the old graphics with the old gameplay of THPS2 over the ones of the remake any time.\nSummarizing my experience with THPS HD, I can't say it was worth the time.

THPSHD uses maps from TH1 and 2 (not counting the DLC in this review) as well as the placement of objectives in this undignified remaster. After hearing me say undignified, you may think that I resent this game and think that it should burn in hell for all eternity. IMO, I do not, but it seriously lacks the dignity and respect that Neversoft originally had for the series back in its hayday.\n\nFirst things first, I bought this game when it was on steam sale for $5, so pricing is not an issue on that end, especially when Robomodo (the developers that took over the TH franchise since TH Ride) sold TH5 for $60, a unhinged pile of ♥♥♥♥. At first i was going to let this one pass as a silly game that would eventually be fixed in the long run, until they pulled the same ♥♥♥♥ on the full retail priced game. But enough of the price on this, lets dive in to the actual game.\n\nthe good: For the most part it is a classic TH game with all obectives pretty much in the same place and alot of classic 90s tunes like Superman make a return. Another thing to note is the return of the upgrade with cash system that was used in TH2, which is a nice return to form, also there is an upgraded roster, but lets be honest, if certain skaters are missing, im less likely to care. The last thing i say that is good are the returning levels, like The Warehouse(TH1), The School(TH2),  and The Hanger(TH2). I wish there was more good i could say about it, but that would pretty much be lying at this point.\n\nThe Bad: For such a game that could of taken the best ideas from the classic games, Robomodo (and Activision) decided to go the cheap route and make this game as short and barren as they possibly could to maximize profit. This makes me sad because the classics had much replayablility without feeling as repetitive. First thing I am going to hit, is how barren the game is, which is only seven levels long... Seriously... seven? That's it? No Roswell, NM? or Outer space? No Skate street?  Um.. okay. Unfortunately, thats not how shallow this game is. Remember multiplayer back in the ps1 days? Yeah those days are gone. Remember Leaderboards? Yeah, i do too... and its not in here either...How about creating your own skate park? Forget about it! Creating your own skater? ♥♥♥♥ off! Wanna know what we get instead?  Big Head Survival, which is meh okay, and Hawkman...totally sucks. But wait, we havent even gotten to the best part! The physics engine! Oh man...suuuuuucks. Wtf do you think you're doing robomoto? Making a satire of Goat Simulator? I'll admit it's really funny at first, but it gets really tiresome after an hour.\n\nOne last thing, which i wont let effect my scoring of this game, but there was one level I left off of the list because i was so disappointed by what was done to it. Marsailles, France used to be my favorite level with how it was a tournament like level between you and the npcs (which you never see skate) that lasts a minute each run and you have to use your best tricks to outbeat your opponent. Well what do you get if you win? Well, a cash prize and a gold medal, which lead to future rewards. Turning my favorite level into a bland objective made me run out of steam in the end and i stopped giving a ♥♥♥♥.\n\nOverall, if you want to check this one out, wait until it is on sale for $5, or better yet, if you own a ps3, buy the classics used for $5 or less on amazon or ebay, and know what true classics are instead of living in a pipe dream with this one.","November 30, 2015","false","7.7"," 42 of 65 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","42","65","3","0"

Negatively received in countless sites is it really disappointing? Read on to find out!\nTony Hawk’s Pro Skater HD is a skateboarding game developed by Robomodo. This game takes the best elements of the classic THPS games and gives them a fresh update to create an all new skateboarding experience for the PC.\n\nYou probably remember playing this masterpiece with your friends overnight just to hit that perfect combo and feel awesome. Now in stunning visuals, the game tries hard to deliver perfection but falls short at times - stick with me while I explain why.\n\nGameplay:This game is all about skating around the levels, mastering ramps, nailing those tricks and ultimately stacking up the biggest combo to earn the best score you can. The game kicks off with a variety of old faces to choose from with the worlds biggest skate pros round out the cast including: Nyjah Huston, Chris Cole, Eric Koston, Andrew Reynolds, Rodney Mullen, Lyn-z Adams Hawkins Pastrana, Riley Hawk and of course -Tony Hawk himself. Each skater has over 8 boards, 3 special moves, and an alternate outfit.\n\nNormally you start the career, choose a level and spawn at a fixed place in that level. From there, you  skate and explore around the level to find things you need to complete a task from your list of objectives. Once you complete a certain number of tasks, the next level unlocks ready to be skated out.\n\nEach level has its own unique tasks to complete, once you complete them you earn cash with which you can buy skills, decks or special tricks. Upon completing the whole career mode you'll unlock the second for your character, while another mode unlocks - Projectives mode which requires 100% objective completion across every map (gaps aren't counted). This mode is the same as career mode but offers difficult challenges for those real Pro Skaters.\n\nThis game also has the old school free-skate mode where you can explore every unlocked level to find new gaps or hidden areas. Beside free-skate there are also Hawkman and Big Head Survival mode. In Hawkman you have to collect pellets in various ways, they all have different colors and all need a special way to get to clarify this let me explain, red pellets are only collectable during jumps, yellow during grinds, and so on.\n\nIn Big Head Survival all you have to do is keep your head growth below 100% or it will explode.. with the typical grow....expand...EXPLODE!. In order to prevent your head from bursting you have to chain combo's and long ones at that otherwise you'll fail and end up without a head not pretty. Both of these modes are great to play because they test your skills and wits. Graffiti mode also makes a return where you gotta nail combos and touch objects, upon completing the combo anything you've touched will change into your characters designated colour, the catch of this mode is to tag more objects than your opponents.\n\nContent:The content of this game is worth for it's price, you get a selection of pro skater levels and it has steam achievements. The new DLC is on it's way.\n\nThe length of the game is 10-30 hours, depending on what you do in-game. If you just rush through the career you will finish the game in 10 hours, if you are an achievement enthusiast and want to master everything you'll easily clock 30 hours. Again, it all depends on your personal way of going about with the game.\n\nFor me it took 30 hours to get every achievement and game modes (beside hawkman) cleared.\n\nGraphics:The game was rebuilt and polished by Robomodo, using Neversoft’s original level models. All I can say is.. well done Robomodo! We finally have the HD version of the game we've been waiting for (or atleast the die-hard THPS fans). During the exploration of levels you'll just LOVE the sweet and eye-pleasing textures of the game. Everything I remember from the old games is so great to see in HD.\n\nBut still there is one thing, just a little thing I didn't like and that is the rag-doll physics in this game. This is just weird, sometimes you just hang around somewhere the other time you have a long neck...you know, graphical glitches.\n\nIn the old version when you bailed you'd fall on the ground, grab your board and continue riding, but here when you bail you'll face a white screen and respawn.. I have to say, it's not pretty. Even the blood has been reduced significantly.\n\nSound:This game has a great soundtrack, it is half classic THPS tracks and half new ones. Still I would love to see more variation of music added and the ability to skip a song like in the old games. Some of the returning tracks are Superman by Goldfinger, Bring the Noise by Public Enemy ft. Anthrax while the newly added tracks are quite good too like Teenage Blood by Apex Manor and many others.\n\n\nConclusion:Gameplay: 8/10\n+ Addictive if you played the old games\n+ Loads of pro-skaters to play with, as well as unlockable bonus skaters\n- Sometimes it's hard to complete a level\n\nContent: 6/10\n+ Old tony hawk's pro skater levels in HD\n+ New game-modes added in singleplayer\n+ New upcoming DLC introduces the Revert from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 (ETA: December 2012)\n- No Multiplayer or LAN (just for the PC version)\n- No Scoreboards of friends\n- Not able to configure or change your controls / graphic settings (needed to be done through a 3rd party launcher or just change the .ini file)\n\nGraphics: 8/10\n+ Great HD upgrade since the old games\n- Physics are sometimes weird\n\nSound: 7/10\n+ Great music to listen during skateboarding\n- More variation of music\n\nOverall Rating: 7/10\nA great skateboard game that all Tony Hawks lovers should play at least once to feel how this game really is.\n\nLoads of people disliked this game but I can't see why. Personally I don't really need a multiplayer in this game just old school skating is enough to keep me happy, you could play it with friends in the same room (just passing the controller to each other). Anyway, if you've enjoyed THPS 1 & 2 it's time to grab the remastered version and relive your childhood, or even if you're a newcomer to the series then this is the best time to start your THPS journey.\n\nNOTE: Old review i wrote for a website.","March 10","true","31.6"," 37 of 58 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","37","58","2","1"

Eventually you begin to realise the collision detection is not as it should be and you will find yourself bailing and clipping through walls quite a lot, regardless of how well you executed a trick. When you need to grind specific rails or transfer between certain verts, the game doesn't always detect it properly, which can lead to a lot of frustration. In certain instances i found the game wouldn't detect when i wanted to jump over a vert rather than come back down on it again; other times i would go to grind a rail, end up clipping it, being "inside" it and would bail trying to get myself out of it.\n\nThe "Big Drop" mechanic seemed really hit or miss a lot too, sometimes i would land fine, other times it would make me bail. It didn't seem consistant at all.\n\nRepetitive music tracks, frustarating controls and the fact it still dispalys all contols with keyboard bindings even if you have a pad plugged in.

There are a LOT of bugs (if you try to do a flip or grab trick when landing a grind, your character flies to oblivion and the map selection has extremly little to offer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ejbspeed/recommended/207210/","ejbspeed","Pywackett-Barchetta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ejbspeed/","340 products in account","Imagine an alternate universe in which Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was never released. (To start with, if such a universe sounds like hell to you, you may want to buy this game.) All the blueprints for THPS and THPS2 were lying around, and years later, a Chicago developer picked them up and thought, "yeah, we could make something of this".\n\nSuch a situation would lead to this game, basically, a new title with a mix of levels from the first two games, in our case primarily based off of THPS2 (2X if you want to get specific). Game mechanics from titles THPS4 and onwards are not at all present, the Big Drop returns, and, actually, the Revert is a default move included with the game now. You do not need the Revert Pack to revert, and you can do so on all levels. Some of these changes may disappoint you if you're used to still playing, say, Underground 2, and expect to be able to wallplant, or jump off anything without having to hold a button, but overall it's a nice way to return to the roots.\n\nThis is a modern title, and the list of skaters is a pretty obvious reminder of that no matter how much you try to see it as the 90's. Names like Chris Cole and Riley Hawk stand out even when there's no Bob Burnquist in the list, but if anything, this offers a fresh set of playable characters instead of the same-old same-old, I suppose. In the end, you're going to fully upgrade most of them, anyways. This is sort of like a reunion tour, taking you to old places while giving you new things to do and new perspective on them.\n\nThere aren't really many new hidden secrets like you'd expect from the original titles. There are some, mostly characters that aren't especially easy to unlock. In general, though, the game is very open about its content, even providing a labeled map on the pause menu if you're stuck on finding certain goals. However, pretty much any secret move or area you learned in the original games is fully intact here, which I find quite admirable.\n\nThe main problem I have with this game, even while I thoroughly enjoy it when it's working nicely, is that it sorta feels incomplete at points. For one, it includes 7 out of a possible 19 levels from the original games (24 levels were present in 2X alone), leaving you less overall content than the original games, though with quality over quantity in terms of visuals, presentation, and gameplay (really, how well do you remember the NY City level?).\n\nThe options menu is where excuses start to fall apart. The only visual option on the menu is resolution. That's it. However, there are PLENTY of intricate options present in the BaseEngine.ini file if you need to tweak it to run smoothly on your computer. Why aren't these just in the options menu if you already programmed them? What is the options menu for if not options? Also, even if you're playing with a keyboard, the on-screen controls are ALWAYS keys despite a smooth plug-n-play transition otherwise. It's like most of the team did an amazing job making this happen and then their work got buried by bad UI decisions.\n\nThe soundtrack actually lives up to exactly what you'd expect from the title. It's mostly music from THPS2, or new music that blends in well with it (except that annoying "room in the mansion" song, the only one I want to turn off, which by the way, you can't). It's all intensely catchy and you'll probably be listening to much of it outside the game soon after. (Only one song comes back from the first game. Yes. It's that one. You know exactly what one.)\n\nIn any case, it's a new Tony Hawk game. It's a new, GOOD Tony Hawk game. If you've ever enjoyed that smooth feeling of the board sliding across a rail, if you've ever exclaimed "Yes!" under your breath at the raw success of landing a 720 grab into a revert into a manual into another grab, or if the word "Kickflip TC's Roof Gap" have any meaning to you, this will be well worth your time. The actual physics of the game are translated quite well (beyond the absolutely ridiculous ragdolling when you bail), and with plenty of game modes, the few levels don't run dry at any rate of speed (though I've never liked the Hawkman mode).\n\nThere is one last thing I want to warn you about. This is a single-player game. There is no multiplayer in this in any way, shape, or form. This seems another thing oddly missing from the PC version specifically, as it is present on the console version. Doesn't matter to me, but may be a dealbreaker for you.","May 10, 2014","true","40.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Sure it's missing multiplayer and create a park/skater but serves for some good fun as long as you take it at face value.\n\nWith the DLC it took roughly 7 hours to do just about everything there is to do in the game but I still go back to it occasionaly to play a couple rounds and I definitely feel I got my money's worth.","November 25, 2013","true","16.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I was greeted with a 'Powered by Unreal Engine' splash, meaning this is a completely different engine, and then a 'Robomodo' splash, which while I already expected that, was still disappointing to see.  For some background - Robomodo are the people behind the Tony Hawk games that used those plastic motion control boards.\n\nGameplay:\nThe balance system is completely terrible, making it impossible for long combos.  In the previous games, every time you would grind or manual in a combo, your balance meter would be slightly reset.  In this game, the balance stays the same until your combo ends, meaning if you jump off a rail and then grind back on, you will most likely bail unless your balance was perfect.\n\nThe skater is incredibly slow, and grinding 90% of the time will only make him slower.  Moving just feels slippery and clunky.  Reverts require a DLC, and even then it's just as poorly implemented as the other mechanics.\n\nLevels:\nThe levels look pretty nice and are spot on with the games they are replicating, though the goals themselves are lazily done.  For example, the competitions are replaced with just collecting 'competition medals' around the map in levels like Marseille.  In the THPS3 DLC maps there's no photo-related goals, and levels like LA have things like the car chase replaced with collecting items around the map.\n\nConclusion:\nIn terms of a remake, it just feels like an incomplete skating game with THPS levels and characters.  It doesn't play like a THPS game, it doesn't have mechanics introduced in the games (which are over a decade old), and just altogether isn't very fun to play.\n\nI've tried multiple times to enjoy this game, but I can't.","August 22, 2015","false","19.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The controls are way too floaty and they aren't very reliable. Sometimes the controls are very unresponsive. Almost every time I try to wall ride my character will start to do the right action and then suddenly bails by flying off the wall, spraying blood everywhere, like I just got punched by the Hulk. I will try to land a 360 kickflip, knick my board on a pixel of a ledge and suddenly my character's body is propelled halfway across the map, board nowhere to be seen and my character's limp body descending to the earth. Please tell me how this makes sense, or do I continuously break the game some how? When I clearly hit the buttons to manual, sometimes my character totally ignores the command and doing transfers off of quarter pipes is almost impossible. You have to hit "up" at the right time, and that right time varies every single try. If they could update it by giving the right trigger button (assuming you're playing with a controller) a spine transfer button (as well as all the other related actions like centering yourself or doing acid drops, etc.) then that would be a huge help. I know spine transfers and all those tricks weren't available in the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skaters, but just adding such a small thing, in my opinion, wouldn't detach from the nostalgia and would just give it a more playable feel. There are many times my character will bail for seemingly no reason, and some positions when I land will be okay sometimes and other times, being in the same exact position, will make me fall. The physics in this game are practically nonexistent at times.\nTo summarize, the game is horrendously inconsistent, and as someone who has played Tony Hawk's games religiously for years, there are so many things that the other games do better and I should be able to land a lot more things than this remake allows me to. I love that they are trying to make an updated version of the original games, and I love that there is a Tony Hawk game on steam that I can play on my computer, but this game just makes me wish they'd just put THUG, THUG 2, or American Wasteland on steam as exact replicas of those original playstation 2 versions.\nIf this game is improved and fixed, then I think it could be a great tribute to the series and much more fun than it is now, but right now there's so much frustration infused in it. When I got mad in the original games, it was because it had a constructive challenge and I just wasn't practiced enough to execute them properly. With this game, the anger comes from stupid glitches that should never happen and prevented me from doing what I should have been able to do. So get this game if you're just a super fan of Tony Hawk games like I am and/or want to have one of the games conveniently on your computer. But until they fix these problems, I'm going to stand by my "not recommended" review.","October 10, 2015","false","12.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","0"

I remember when I got the first one for N64 and even began skateboarding in 4th grade because of it. I played:\n\n•	Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater\n•	Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2\n•	Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3\n•	Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 4\n•	Tony Hawk’s Underground\n•	Tony Hawk’s Underground 2\n\nThis iteration lacks a lot of the magic from those previous games. I was wondering what it was that made me so bored of this game when it released in 2012, and I revisited it shortly to try to realize why. I discovered the following:\n\n•	No create-a-park, create-a-skater, or really any customizability.\n•	The levels feel old, not classic. Also, there are very, very few stages.\n•	The unlocking process for each stage is more of a chore because it relies on tasks completed on the previous stage, whereas before you had the option to move to another stage to try to complete those tasks.\n•	No way to end your run after completing one specific goal.\n•	Awful menu navigation.\n•	No multiplayer (not even locally).\n•	The “cash” in the game is useless. You use it to purchase tricks, but this is still way more boring than the previous iterations which let you buy stages and boards, etc.\n•	A couple of controls are just missing, such as the drop-in button or the leveling button that made it way easier to navigate.\n\nOverall, this port just felt rehashed over lunch, extremely lazy, and money-grabbing. Very poor quality even compared to the very first game in 1999.\n\nThere are achievements I guess, but I had tons of fun with this series before achievements were ever a thing.\n\nSteer clear of this one.","August 20, 2013","false","1.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If you've played THUG or THAW you'll know while tricking on things, it feels fast and viceral while you complete millions of points in combos. Here you sluggishly complete combos which feels like they tried to make the game more realistic.\n\nThe PC port is also very bad. You can't change your resolution or any of the graphics options. They'll probably fix it in a patch, but given it's Activision I doubt it. Pro Skater HD is not what I expected and it's really hard to defend it.

Don't be deceived. Not only does this game feel unfinished, missing many maps that should of been included in THPS HD to begin with (e.g. Airport) but it is functionally broken. Robomodo clearly aren't as talented as their Neversoft forebearers. There are more than a few noticeable glitches that ruin play including bails that will send you rocketing into the sky and strange clipping/draw-in issues that plague many of the levels.\n\nTHPS HD looks and plays far worse than Project 8, a Tony Hawk's title released nearly six years prior. The controls in general also feel awful in this release, not half as responsive nor as snappy as you'd hope. Perhaps what upset me the most about this release is the lack of multiplayer modes. Tony Hawk's online was one of the first experiences I had playing over the internet and I imagine it still has people playing it via XLinkKai. To see the multiplayer missing in this release, even in terms of local splitscreen play, is a complete let-down as far as I'm concerned.\n\nSo should you bother with this release? Not really. If anything, this release is aimed at suckers to nostalgia such as myself. If you want to relive the memories of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater  there are far better ways of doing it. Nothing is stopping you from getting any of the earlier releases in the series on PC so if you insist on running the likes of Tony Hawks Pro Skater 3 in actual high defintion, nothing is stopping you from doing that instead.","January 21, 2013","false","1.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Some of the fondest memories I have of playing Tony Hawk (especially the first game) were playing with my friends on good old co-op split screen and racing down the dam (or whatever), through the mall, or just doing points competitions until you realised your opponent was playing Bam Margera and doing Christ Air combos everywhere until you banned them from doing it.\nIf this game had been updated for internet play, or even had LAN/split screen co-op, then this would have been a great game indeed... but sadly it's just a single player skating game that feels like it's lacking something.\nI don't know if it's the skater handling/physics, I can't pick if it's the slightly altered level designs or the slightly unusual trick flow... but I know that after playing this game for maybe an hour and a half, I was pretty tired of it. The whole point of the game seems to be to play a level over and over until you've completed all the objectives so that you can go onto the next level and do it all over again.

The game takes you back to two minute runs with classic career objectives such as getting the secret tape, kick flipping TC’s roof gap and what not. In addition to the Career mode, the game also has a few other game modes such as Big Head Survival, Hawkman and extra Projectives when you finish Career.\n\nYes, the high school level is back! Yes, the warehouse level is back! And yes you can once again Ollie the Magic Bum 5x. Most of the best levels from Pro Skater and Pro Skater 2 are included as well as three levels from Pro Skater 3 if you purchase the Revert Pack DLC which also adds the revert mechanic which significantly increases your combo potential.\n\nWhile the game has obviously gotten a huge graphics upgrade, I felt like the physics were a bit… off. Things seemed to feel more realistic in the original games, but in HD it feels like I’m sometimes flying unnaturally through the air. There’s also no animations for stacking/bailing; your character just kinda ragdolls on the spot and spurts out blood.\n\nThe PC version unfortunately has a few optimization and other console-porty errors and doesn't contain multiplayer (yet the console version does!). There’s also no skater creator like there was in Pro Skater 2 and 3, but instead, a decent assortment of uncanny-valley-esque professional skaters from both the older games and current real-life professionals.\n\nI personally, really liked HD, I loved the playing the old maps, hearing the old music (the new music was really good too!) and the simplistic game mechanics of the original Pro Skater games before the series let you natas-spin fire hydrants for 10 minutes and walk around off-board whenever you please.\n\nHowever if you were late to the series you might not find HD as fun as other Tony Hawk’s games, as this is purely a remake of the original Pro Skater games and doesn’t really improve on the old features much, but if you’re looking for a fun childhood nostalgia trip, I recommend you give Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater HD a look.","April 20, 2014","true","17.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

After the many attempts at playing with new ideas, then going out of control with further attempts at innovation to escape escalating competition, Robomoto had finally decided to take the series back to how Neversoft originally envisioned the series from the beginning.  So to finally play the remake of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1 & 2 put together was quite a treat.\n\nWith that said, do I recommend this game?  NO.\n\nRobomoto was responsible for making Tony Hawk Ride and Shred.  Both were attempts at pushing their skateboarding controller, and failed due to the overpricing of the software and perpherial considering how lack luster the content was.  If you want the full run down on that, I recommend you refer to scxcr's review of the first game: https://youtu.be/-QQVxcbZv1I\n\nSo with Robomoto coming back to develop a classic Tony Hawk game would understandably leave people into a lot of doubt.  While they actually did attempt to make a classic Tony Hawk game, "attempt" being the key word here, it just falls short on its delivery.  The first game had a good set of levels and skaters, a two player mode, along with customizability, which were expanded greatly with each game, such as adding a custom-skater option, a bunch of cameo characters to play with (Spider Man skateboarding?  How can you go wrong?!), custom-park mode where you can make your own levels, and even LAN or online play in future titles.  THPS1 & 2 were remade as THPS2X as an Xbox Exclusive, including everything from both games plus a new set of levels.\n\nWhen you play THPSHD, it just feels... empty.  It felt more like a proof of concept game than anything.  Especially released on PC where you get virtually no graphic options.  It is as barebones as it gets.  You don't get every single level, no custom-skater mode, no skate shop, no custom-park, not even a two player mode.  I feel ashamed to even bought this in hopes that it means there will be more Tony Hawk games like this.  But alas, Robomoto had failed me, and I am sure it failed everyone too.  Especially with their latest release of THPS5, which had suffered numerous problems, lack a lot of content, and dared to bare a name that left the classic series so highly regarded back then.\n\nTo summarize: Don't buy this game.  It is bad.","January 6","false","0.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

What does that mean? It means no flatground tricks, sans the manual, no linking together epic scores, and a lot of do-overs for certain goal requirements that are set. I know many are saying these detract, but I honestly find it just as exhilerating and exasperating as I remember. Granted, sometimes it will take you a whole run to complete one goal, and you might have to have a few runs, even with the new map feature that displays item locations. But what I liked about that when I was a kid was that that's how you would actually skate. Pick a spot, set up, and keep at it til you got what you wanted. If you want to progress through the single player, the goals can seem tedious at times, and the physics match the sometimes sluggishness of what the originals had in store for a skater (think wallrides...). That being said, I threw in the towel after THAW, and now that I don't have any next gen console versions, I think this is a fair attempt to recreate some of the charm of the originals, especially with it being decently cheap. Yes, there is no multiplayer, Yes, there is no create-a-skater, yes, there are limited levels, DLC nonwithstanding, however for someone like me who doesn't mind a single skate to just burn an hour away and embrace some nostalgia, this is worth it. The graphics are decent enough for any remake of this nature, and my controls work perfectly on a wireless 360 controller. 8/10","May 4, 2014","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I also played both Underground series as well as Project 8. When i saw the HD remake of the game, i was really excited, but after a while it made me sad. Why?\n\nLet's start right off with the not-so-good- things:\n\n- The physics. At some point, they are great, flip tricks and grinds feel realistic to me, but when it comes to air time and several movements, it looks reeeaaally unrealistic. That's what i loved about the older THPS games, where the movements were more realistic.\n\n- The tricks. What just happened with the tricks?! I LOVED the wide spectrum of tricks you could do in the old THPS games, such as flatland tricks (casper, handstand, pogos etc.). All you can do here is simple manuals. NOT EVEN PIVOTS. And moreover, you are not able to do Double/Triple Flips. If you wanna do a Double Kickflip, the skater does two Kickflips seperately mid air. WHY?! This is so messed up. Double/Triple Flips are part of the game! I will never understand why they removed that. They didn't even include Tre Flips. This is a standard trick which is must-have in every skate game. But here, nope. Another sad point, you cannot combine grinds. In the early THPS games you could press square, triangle or circle to combine more grinds in one (you were able to do Nosegrinds to Nosebluntslides without jumping in between). And, what actually annoys me the most, you cannot edit special tricks properly, since the game only shows the keyboard buttons, but not the controller buttons. BIG thumbs down.\n\n- Extended Functions. You cannot edit or create a skater. REALLY?! This is really upsetting. That was such a cool function back then. All you can do is buy different boards, thats it. Boring! Where is my beloved park editor?! Oh, and not to forget simple nuances like Soundtrack. Seriously, i feel like this game didnt recieve any amount of love towards the older parts. I want to see the playlist, and i want a great amount of music while skating. Why not include a function where you can listen your own tracks like they did in Project 8 or Underground 2? (not sure which of these 2 games featured that). To be honest, i am fine with the graphic settings, it is okay for me to only set the resolution. I do not need more than that.\n\n- Other stuff. Yes, what i also want to mention is the audio engine. Lets say you skate the mall and you crash through a glass wall. The breaking glass is so enormously loud that it almost broke my ears. I know i am picky but... seriously... i am used to perfectly made skating games, so i do demand a lot from remakes. Also, the amount of levels is really messed up. I basically unlocked all levels in one day, where is the fun?? I would LOVE to skate Chicago in the remake, as well as San Francisco. I am kinda stuck to THPS4 so... And oh yeah, i almost forgot that, wallrides, manual combos and grinds barely work. Another thumbs down for that. Also, replays are not included. I still dream about one day where game developers include a replay function with different camera settings in a sports game, so you are able to create awesome cinematics, some sort of virtual skate videos/movies. I am still hoping... Let's come to the conclusion.\n\nIf you want to play a skating game in between queue times of League of Legends or if you want to play something quick, then buy this game. It is okay for that price. But if you do want a great skating game, if you want variety and an awesome experience, DO NOT BUY IT.

Sadly it's is more of a Greatest Hits album only featuring a handful of levels from the originals.\n\nA few things that brings this game down in value are that you can't change the key bindings.  It's likely possible to change them using a keyboard emulator but it's very much a pain in the behind.  Another awful thing about this game is that the menu where you pick which tricks you'd like your skater to be able to execute, it only shows icons for your PC's keyboard and not XBOX or PS3 controller key icons.  So if you play using a controller, you have to remember that (, = X) and that(. = Y) and that (/ = B)  Confused? Yea that'll happen if you try customize your tricks at all.\n\nIn summary, this game is worth $10 if you're willing to deal with the lack of levels and poorly thought out control scheme.","February 8, 2014","true","12.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Since 2007 THPS has suffered with the release of EA's Skate in an attempt to move from its arcade like roots and try (and fail) a more realistic approach which really doesn't fit the franchise. I can only recommend THPS HD because it is simply the best modern instalment of the game since American Wasteland back in 2005. With Neversoft out of the picture and THPS 5 being the final nail in the coffin this is probably going to be the best we are going to get.

No local multiplayer, no create a skater, no park editor.  In addition, they lost a lot of lisencing for the music tracks, and a lot of skaters you'll remember from the old ones are missing.  The physics also fail to live up to the original, with skaters often bailing if you press the ollie + grind buttons too fast (especcially on ramps), and the bailing animations themselves are incomplete. Finally, to nit pick, there's no way to view your skater's special moves without exiting to the main menu, and graphics settings are very limited (as in, the ONLY option is tthe screen resolution).\n\nWhat I do like: The numerous extra objectives added to each level is better than the original 5 goals per level for the THPS1 levels.\n\nI got it on a sale, so I personally don't feel cheated money wise, but I can't recommend the game for its full price (and DLC is required for the full amount of content in my opinion).

If you're willing to pay a few bucks for a small revisit, I'd recommend it. You can choose between a few levels from THPS and THPS2, all revamped in gorgeous HD graphics. The models and levels look fantastic. Skating around can be fun if you get around the bad physics.\n\nHowever, the game does have its flaws. The physics are wonky and sometimes irritating. The falling animation is just ridiculous. Also, this game lacks any customization at all. You can't change the controls, you can't change the looks of your skater, you can't create your own park, nothing. There isn't even a multiplayer modus. The only thing there is, is singleplayer. But, that didn't prevent me from having some fun while beating all the game's objectives.\n\nI myself have enjoyed many hours of singleplayer skating just because I liked the revamped levels and I got used to the wonky physics. Yes, there isn't a lot to this game, but this game is not a bad game for what you pay. It's just not a "full" Tony Hawk game, only a small revisit for a few bucks.\n\nI'd recommend this game despite its flaws, but only if you're a dedicated fan of this series.

With levels and engine essentially lifted from the original games, you'd think that Robomodo could have at least gotten the physics to be half decent, but that's just asking too much of the developers of Ride and Shred. Random ramps and walls have awkward hitboxes that cause your skater to jet off in random directions.\nAnd the game doesn't even look good enough to justify the performance issues.\n\nAlso, reverts locked behind paid DLC. REVERTS. The novelty was supposed to be in the levels, skaters, and feel, not in limiting the features.\n\nSpeaking of limiting features, no real muliplayer to speak of.\n\nThere's also a goal in the DLC that requires many of the characters to purchase a grab trick to put into their trickset, because it's not included in the standard street moveset. Remember how THPS3 had a ton of those kinds of goals, but Neversoft (RIP) were decent enough to actually only give goals for tricks that your skater already had. And even if you DO buy the trick and put it in the trickset for your skater, there's no guarantee that it will actually allow your skater to do the trick.\n\n\nBasically, this game is maybe worth it at 75% off. And only if you no longer have the system(s) you played the original games on, and don't want to emulate. And even then, only buy this game if you hate yourself.\n\nThen it might be worth it.","November 3, 2015","false","68.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It's reliving your childhood, but in HD. Graphics are great.\n\nThe grinding and manual system is more or less the same, if not better.\n\nThere are several character additions, although they did remove a few as well, which disappointed me, like Andrew Reynolds.\n\nYou can also be James Hetfield of Metallica.\n\nYou play, earn money, collect it in levels, go to the shop, and buy either boards, stats, or tricks.\n\nThere's also a special cheat area where unknown objectives in the game will unlock a cheat/mod that you can enable in the game, such as unlimited grind, or just turn your player transparant using the "Ghost Mode."\n\nAs well as cheats, you can also unlock side-games that come when accomplishing other unknown objectives.\n\nIf you have a cheat enabled, the game does not award you achievements when you accomplish something, so you need to keep them off unless you feel like randomly free skating for fun.\n\nThe turning accuracy of the player has definitely improved, whereas the original would sometimes give problems, causing you to slam into things. It just wasn't as sharp.\n\nBoard customization is gone, but you can change your board still, not that it means anything.\n\nThe saddest thing in this is that there is no online multiplayer. It would have been really great to take on other players in runs for the highest score, like an official street skating event, or even have people in the same level as you to compete for high score.\n\nI also wish that they would include a create-a-character. I'd love to use my own self-made character rather than the forced default.\n\nI'd say overall, this remake is nearly as good as Project 8(with a few shortcomings), which I consider the best of the franchise, and this certainly surpasses all other skating games. Now that this original THPS is in HD with new model and texture rendering, it's almost like a new game. You'll never want to go back to the old versions again... now can we get Project 8 on Steam too? :)","December 22, 2013","true","7.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Trust me.  Just do it.  Forget graphics, forget slightly better physics.  It doesn't matter.  This game is so lacking in content and so short that I can't believe it even exists.  How could a game as open, free and creative as Underground 2 exist when something like this came ten years after?  It is made by different people, but REALLY.  This is a bad joke.  You can't make a game in a series that is 15 years old and give it less content that the 3rd game had.  Yes, Pro Skater 3 is about twice as good as this game.  I'm not joking.  I've played Tony Hawk games my entire life and these past few games are like a bad dream.  I can't wrap my head around this game being real when it doesn't have create-a-skater, park editor, trick editor, 1/8 of the tricks of even underground 1, and nothing to do expect classic 2:00 mode.  I fear for the game industry if anyone really thinks products like this are acceptable.

The THPS franchise is one of my favorite video game series and I think this type of game could really make a comeback if put under the right developers.\n\nThis entire game feels so "clunky". If you're going to make a THPS game, responsive controls are necessary but unfortunately something this dev team fails to grasp. There's also a weird amount of content left out from the game that would have been included in an original version of THPS. No spine transfer manuver? How am I supposed to navigate the field if one of the basic manuvering concepts of the game is gone? Along with this being gone, there's no way to "level out" if you happen to go up a quarter pipe and want to land on a different surface. There's also a lack of music selection. One of the coolest parts of THPS is the giant list of songs and being able to see what's playing and select new songs from the start menu. There is music in this reboot but no song selection, and no ability to even see what's playing. When your character falls down after messing up a trick, you used to get back up and skate on. Now it flashes a white screen and your character is just upright again. Whatever happened to the badass-ness that was getting up after a crazy fall? These seem like small things but they really add up in the end. THPS is a fun, platform-ish, combo based video game that I poured hours into as a kid. This feels like a cash grab aimed at people who want to experience that game again with better graphics and some new features. No matter the size of your nostalgia boner for this game is, I would advise against getting it. I even got it on sale and still regret it. Sorry guys, but they beefed it. 2/10","October 18, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 was my first owned video game ever, before that I've played the crap out of the first 2 in my cousin's house. Aside from NBA JAM, this series was my favorite of all-time, from 10 million point combos to the soundtrack, it was my go-to game.. The physics and scoring system I can forgive, even the new songs, because they arent bad MINUS THE BOMB SONG WHICH IS COMPLETE ♥♥♥. Now I get the online not being here sort of, due to hacking online and a small company not wanting to take a risk etc. But no leaderboards was a painful thing to realize that they don't have. I know the consoles had bad score hacking but I would rather have the idiots be on top while I compete with honest ones. I bought it because I'm no longer on consoles for the most part, so basically to me the only reason is for Achievements. The challenge in that is that I actully have to play the game.. Now to newcomers that are unforunate to be born in the modern day where everything is effed up, try it, you may catch that fun I had when I was a kid playing this on christmas with THPS3, but for veterens, if you have a console, just get that.

(the first THPS has as many levels as this has, and this is supposed to be a remake of the first 2-3 games combined.)\nNO MULTIPLAYER! NO ONLINE, NO LAN CONNECTION, AND NO SPLITSCREEN. This was the worst part, playing with friends was the best part of these games.\n(the not so bad)\nNo character creation.\nVery low music, even at max (and very FEW musics, they get very repetitive)\nVery few characters to choose from\n\nEverything about this seems watered down and lazy. They spent more time making the graphics better than actually making it play like it should. Everything seems like it was rushed, and they definately messed up by having no multiplayer support at all.\n\nTL;DR Game doesn't feel like THPS should, it definately doesn't play like the original 2-3, and the lack of levels and multiplayer ruined it. If you're a fan of the originals, don't get this.

It is more of a highlight reel put together by fans of the franchise than a 100% port of the original. That being said, it is still very much Tony Hawk Pro Skater and has hours of playability.\n\nThe base game has seven levels from THPS 1 & 2 (Warehouse, School II, Hangar, Mall, Venice Beach, Downhill Jam, Marseilles), and the DLC adds three huge maps from THPS 3 (Airport, LA, Canada). An awesome feature they used was that they locked all of the levels, making you play and complete the challenges in order to progress to the next stage. The hidden S-K-A-T-E's are all still in their original places, as well as the VHS's, except they have been changed to DVD's.\n\nPurchasing the DLC also adds the ability to revert during combos on all maps, allowing you to carry them for a longer amount of time. Additional content includes four new skaters: Steve Caballero, Geoff Rowley, James Hetfield and Robert Trujillo of Metallica.\n\nMost of the complaints I see are about wonky physics, but the franchise has always had wonky physics. I booted up my original THPS2 on console and it was pretty damn wonky. But that is what added to the fun and charm of the franchise, at least to me. However, there unfortunately are no multiplayer game modes, and there is also no level editor.\n\nStill highly recommended for skateboarding fans and fans of the franchise!","November 20, 2014","true","8.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

For some reason, multiplayer was removed from this version which is a major stab to all the THPS PC community.  Anyways, besides all that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD provides us with classic levels we loved from the first two Pro Skaters. Half the soundtrack is from the first two Pro Skaters while the other half is new. The new tracks are overall alright but nothing will ever match the original soundtrack. Despite that, the new tracks do fit in with the atmosphere and overall feel of the game. The game runs on the Unreal Engine now and it is quite noticable. However, the differences in the engine do not stop you from continuing to rack up combos and continue to enjoy what is known as the Tony Hawk series.\n\n85/100","June 27, 2013","true","1.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The physics situation in this version is straight up atrocious, with completely ridiculous bails where your body will fly in the exact opposite direction it should. The skating isn't nearly as smooth as THPS3 or 4 (my personal favorites) and feels more like the N64 versions with just better graphics.\n\nAnother issue that is just absurd, is landing in vert. To get a perfect landing, it only looks to see if you land at the exact same angle that you took off, which makes no sense if you are traversing a gap horizontally. Terrible.\n\nThe maps don't feel alive, there is a distinct lack of atmosphere with little or no NPCs around.\n\nIf you can grab it on sale and really need a THPS fix, then go for it. But make sure you have a controller because it's awful to play with a keyboard. At full price I wouldn't recommend. So my "Yes I would recommend" is more like a "yes, but only if you realllllly miss THPS."","February 12","true","33.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The moment I saw that the games were going to be remade in HD I freaked out and I was so hyped to play the games and relive some good memories. This game seriously delivered with some pretty good controls, excellent graphics, fantastic soundtrack, and generally brings back nostalgia. This game has tons of replay value if you want to max the stats out of your skaters or just beat career mode over and over again. I've done that and it is so fun to play the original Tony Hawk games again.\n\nAlthough this game was good, there was some flaws that really stand out. The fact that create-a-skater is gone and some other cool unlocks are gone (like Spiderman in THPS2). They dont have 2-player splitscreen or even creating a park isn't even here. There are also game glitches and clipping that is really bothersome to me. Some players have argued that there is a restriction on resolutions that you have to edit it in the games files for it to fit their proper resolutions which is a problem.\n\nThose things aside, I highly recommend this game if you've played the three Tony Hawk's Pro Skaters and want to play the levels again in HD. I give this game a 9.5/10 because the complaints I've given are minor and don't really relate to me and I love the nostalgic value this game has given me.","March 27, 2014","true","51.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","3"

I wasn't really expecting it to be an exact port, or anything, but I did expect a litle more...effort to be put into it? I don't know. I only spent like $8 on it, so it's not a total loss. The bad psyhics kind of ruin it, but that's just me. It's probably because I'm just remembering HOW GOOD it was back on Xbox. There's too many let downs for me to recommend it, however. For one: the psyhics. The bailing animation is...bad. Also, the fact that it offers no controller explantion? Did they REALLY expect people to play a SKATING GAME with a KEYBOARD and MOUSE??? I didn't think so, but apparently they did. I REALLY wish I still had my Xbox, in all honesty. Maybe I could emulate it...Anyways. It has nice graphics and music, but I'd seriously tell you to not get it at full price. It might be one of the rare times...where...I kind of want a refund. If you ever (which is HIGHLY UNLIKELY) get the chance to play the orginal ones on an Xbox, do it. I bet (I KNOW) it'd be a LOT better. I've played some pretty bad remakes, so this is rather dissapointing. I...guess, if you want, get it on sale, I wouldn't recommend it though.

I really cannot understand where these people are coming from. In fact, a lot of them have < 1 hour playtime so I am not sure their opinions are relevant.\n\nI played THS, THPS2 and THPS3 back when they released on PS1 and this is a great way to revisit those games. They have really captured the feel of them. With the remastering it is like you are playing both a new game and the game you grew up loving.\n\nThis features some of the classic tracks from the originals, all my favourites at least. Warehouse, Hangar, School II, Marseille etc.\n\nThere is a DLC with THPS3 tracks on too like Canada and LA. Which brings me to another point. All the people ♥♥♥♥♥ing about revert being included as a DLC when it "should have been in from the start". This game was originally a remastering of the first 2 games. Not 3. Revert was not in the first 2 games. But you probably didn't actually play the originals. The developers bowed to the beggars and whiners and released revert in the DLC and were good enough to release 3 THPS3 traks with it and the price isn't outlandish like a lot of other DLC out there. Yes there's no track creator but there is a host of brand new game modes, all of which are pretty damn fun.\n\nIf I could give it one criticism it's that split-screen multiplayer would have been great. But that by no means qualifies this as a bad game. Look at the sidebar over there, it says Single-player, you know what you're getting going in.\n\nThe soundtrack is as amazing as ever, No Cigar, You, May 16, all my personal favourites from the original games as well as a few welcome additions.\n\nIgnore the babies. If you liked the original you'll like this.\n\nP.S. I have been playing with a controller and this review is based on that play.

Also this game would've been a lot better if it hard local (or even any) multiplayer.\nHowever the levels are amazing, the soundtrack is pretty good and you will get a few hours out of it. Though if you want a bit more I recommend getting the DLC.\nIn conclusion I recommend this game to those who would want to play a skateboarding game on steam. If you want to play a good one I recommend you grab Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 or something (I would say THUG but that's hard to find)","June 29, 2014","true","8.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Playing THPS HD with a controller could use a little work, but overall the game is perfectly playable with a keyboard. Don’t be fooled by the graphics, it looks brilliant in game. Music in THPS HD is over average in terms of quality but it isn't varied and repetitive. There are couple of achievements available for this game but there are no leaderboards, no multiplayer game modes available, so if you are looking for any form of challenge at all, this is the wrong game to be buying. Since it's the only skateboarding game available on Steam, I personally think it totally deserves to be bought.","December 28, 2012","true","5.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Have you went back recently and played the first two? They haven't aged well. Like, at all.\n\nPros:\n\nThe graphics are quite nice, atleast compared to the original.\nThe soundtrack has a few songs from the first two, but there are only so many you get licensed now-a-days. The new songs are not that bad either. (Yes, Superman is still in the game)\nIt controls rather smoothly and responds quickly. I personally would choose a controller for this type of game, but we will get to that later.\nDoing tricks have never been so easy and smooth. There is just something about this game that makes landing a trick so satisfying.\n\nBut, this game is not perfect, no game is.\n\nCons:\n\nControlling and pulling off tricks with a keyboard is hard to master. It took me a good 15 min. to remember what is what.\nThe length of this game is really short. This game does NOT include ALL THE LEVELS from the first two, only the good ones. (But they left out downtown from the first ;-;)\nEvery now and then, the game would glitch out, an example of this is if you were to bail, you skater may go flying in the air.\nNO CREATE-A ANYTHING MODE. Just the game, levels, free skate, career, and two or three other modes i dont care about.\nNo online mode on pc, but its on console.

This was an issue that I had when first playing the game with my Logitech Dual Action. The game remained 'playable', however the game had issues when the imputs occured too quickly. Later on I switched to using a Dualshock 3 with ScpServer and have had no issues since (having no problem with clearing all objectives, I refuse to acknowledge 'poor control' as a reason to dismiss this game).\n\n-  Bugs	. Occasionally I have seen some graphical bugs with the textures, as they become blurry for brief moments during gameplay. While I understand that graphical bugs can defeat the purpose of an 'HD remake' for some, please note that this issue rarely occured and had no effect the gameplay itself. Another bug is the result of wonky crash physics that sometimes cause the character to ragdoll or bounce upon wipeout. While some might think this as a bug, it is only experienced once the character has fallen and broken their trick combo. Rest assured that these bugs are only a minor annoyance and will not affect your performance in doing tricks or completing objectives.\n\n- No Multiplayer	. Yeah, I can agree that this sucks. Seeing as how multiplayer was in the ps3/360 port, I don't know why It wasn't implemented in the PC version. I would hope for a multiplayer mod, but it's unlikely that will ever happen.\n\n-  Waah my nostalgia!. Despite the game only containing a few levels from each of the THPS 1-3 games, it remains unchanged from the original games despite the graphical improvements (as an 'HD remake' should have). The music, level design, objectives, skaters and boards are all the same (with the expection of the secret area inside the school not being available. If you can't experience nostalgia here then it seems you might not have had any experience with the original games at all, or your 'nostalgia' has limited you from enjoying this game.\n\nThe game also provides plenty of extra game modes that the original games did not, allowing for extended replay value. I had a blast playing this game and could reccomend to anyone looking to play THPS in HD.","August 3, 2015","true","11.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Maybe its because I never played 'Ride' or 'Shred'. But I probably still would have loved them. I was even one of the only people to like Project 8 for PS2. In fact, I still own it, and play it often.\n\nSo needless to say. I love this game. Maybe its because of nostalgia. Maybe it really is a good game. But everything is solid, the controls, the characters, the levels. Oh, and the music.\n\nThe soundtrack is PERFECT. It has some new songs, but them fit in with the game, and when a old song comes on, I feel my inner 6 year old coming out, and singing along to the tunes I loved. In fact, I would say that if you played the old games, to just buy this for the soundtrack. I don't know why you cant buy it separately.\n\nThe levels really feel like the old Pro Skater, its perfect. I still get memories from smashing through the glass at the Warehouse, so I really, really loved that level.\n\nThe controls are fun and actually surprisingly good on keyboard. It was really well thought out for convenience. And my hands didn't get tired.\n\nOne of the things I disliked, was the lack of characters, or character customization. And also, no multiplayer was a majorly missed opportunity. To be in a clan again would be great. (Also the idea of being in a clan called 'Faze' in Tony Hawk' amused me.\n\nHowever the characters that were there, looked nice, and the ragdoll was hilarious. It added the goofiness the series had. And when your skater got glitched into the ground like a moleman made me laugh.\n\nI however, did not like the grindbar. Grinding is a major part of the game. The look of the bar should be perfect. But that is  just a small thing.\n\nSUMMERY:\nIt has little bad things. But major good things. 7/10","June 20, 2014","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The Tony Hawk's series has had a steady decline in quality over the past years and this HD remake was supposed to bring back life to the games. However, it really fails at that. The only thing this game offers is a graphical update of some old, classic Tony Hawk's levels (and some, which suck...seriously? Downhill Jam?) but fails to deliver a good interpretation of the old-school gameplay. Firstly, the physics are a mess. I'm not sure if they tried to blend arcade and realistic gameplay but a lot of the time you find yourself bailing in situations that would be a normal, if somewhat sketchy, landing in previous games. Yes, in real life if you landed like that you would eat a good serving of concrete but not in an old-school Tony Hawk game. We have the EA Skate series for realistic skateboarding frustration, we didn't need that in an arcade skateboarding game. Something else I found awful were the insane difficulty spikes and declines. Of course, this could be contributed to my complete lack of gaming skill but it just feels like they randomly picked some levels and threw them in there in no particular order.\nMy biggest gripe - NO MULTIPLAYER! Not even local multiplayer, let alone online. And this is a big problem, because while the game is mediocre if could have been pretty fun with some people around.\nTony Hawk's Pro Skater HD has 3 good things in it - a pretty good soundtrack, the warehouse level and Chris Cole. Other than that, you're better off getting one of the old games for that nostalgic kick we all need. Only get this if it's stupidly cheap in a sale. It's a good recreation of the originl games' look but it fails at what's most important - making the skateboarding gameplay fun.","October 5, 2014","false","3.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

My board sometimes went sailing off into space and I go the opposite direction.\nThe game likes to cheat with the big drops, telling you right before you fall on your face.\nThe game is basically inaccessible to the newcomers without cheats.\nGoals become extremely hard in career mode. It asked me to get 3 roll call rails, but I couldn't tell what they were until I grinded on them.\n\nWith all of that said, it's a very fun game.

The XBOX 360 controller works well. It is pretty much unplayable on keyboard unless you are a masochist, really, don't even try.\n\nSo, I realise that with remakes there are fanatical cannon dorks who want you to stay true to the original, but really, this is not one of those situations. Leaving out the tranny revert was a mistake; landing on the ramp transition and doing a revert into a manual is a feature from later games that this really should have. Only the 3 levels in the DLC pack apparently have that. The other major linking trick missing is the wall plant. Wall rides are there, great, but the wall plant lets you fly head on at a wall, pause momentarily and then effectively bounce off and head back the way you came. These two tricks allow for very long high scoring runs, and should have been coded in. I mean, it's not like Devs had to create the game from scratch right ;) (Yes I am downplaying the work involved in updating a game's textures and resolution to HD, but think about the level design and and the other stuff they didn't need to do).\n\nThere is also no way out of a bad ramp exit. If you fly off the side of the ramp, your body is effectively horizontal to the ground and you are going to stack. I am sure I recall later games letting you lean and correct so you can land flat. That's a minor gripe, because it only happens when you've stuffed up, but it's frustrating because as soon as you do it you know it's going to be bad.\n\nFinally, it is a little glitchtastic sometimes. You are prone to ragdolling into the fourth dimension, which can happen when you are just trying to grind something or wall ride and don't hit it quite right. It's like you hit a pebble or something and then fly 5 stories into the air. Something is not quite right with the physics of that. Apart from that the game is pretty stable. It's not like it crashes but its a glitch.\n\nStill a fun game 20 years later","January 9, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some of these elements can be found in this HD remake of a small selection of levels and songs from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 brought back from the dead with the voodoo of the Unreal Engine which as usual does an admirable job even after so many years. The classics don't lose their magic and you will keep finding new lines and combos even after years (and I should know, I've been playing the series since 1999) however the selection of levels and songs is rather small and the levels themselves aren't big either, because they were designed with the limitations of late nineties consoles. There is not much to do here,a tiny assortment of gameplay modes that each eschew any sort of invitation to play them for more than a few rounds. A tiny amount of purely cosmetic unlockables, play it through once, never pick it up again. There's also no multiplayer on PC.\n\nThis anorexic approach to game design is further mangled by a failed revamping of the gameplay. The new physics engine lacks the tight and fluid control that the series is known for. There are no ways to change key bindings in-game, the process to change the .ini files is lengthy and tedious for anyone not playing with the xbox controller and even then the controls just seem off or wobbly for lack of a more technical term. Graphical settings are handled in the same shoddy manner. ini or die.\n\nTHPS HD comes off as the final lazy attempt to cash in on the last breath of a dead series. Namesake Tony Hawk always seemed very sincere about the series he helped create and connected it deeply in skate culture, but here they just dropped the ball so hard it tunneled miles past where the catastrophic Tony Hawk's Shred and Ride finally came to rest covered in money glued on with the tears of children who got them as christmas gifts.\n\nThere's no real market for this game. Old fans will be disappointed, newcomers will be turn off their computer in frustration. If you want to play the series again or the first time on PC, there are so many better options. Tony Hawk's Underground 1 and 2 run well on modern systems because of a dedicated modding community, THPS 2 to 4 were also released on PC. Even buying the first two games on playstation for the estimated 2 bucks they will cost you and firing up an emulator will get you a better experience overall and better introduction to a great series of times past, filled with hours upon hours of highly addictive fun.","January 17, 2015","false","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Somone new to the series would most likely enjoy this remake but others familiar with the original series tony hawk's pro skater 1,2,3,4 and THUG series would most likely be disappointed. The game is more of a remake of 1,2,3,4 on a new engine with missing essential elements to the original series. Acid drops, spine transfers, manual tricks  (EX truckstand, casper) are completly missing. Players also looking for the THUG experience with a new story should stay away from this game or expect less. Setting options are also a downside to this game. Not having any other settings is also a downside. This clearly show's the game is a straight console port looking exactly like the PS3 version. This is not a real downside but being the PC version I expected a bit more. Also the sound setting for the Effects are completly broken I found my self turning down the SFX volume yet having the sound effects of Cars and breaking object completly blasting my ears even with everything else turned down. Ended up turning off the sound manualy in windows. Speaking of sound berely having any tracks may cause some people to just mute their in game music and play their own which is what I do but for $10 bucks its unexceptable. Also older Tony Hawk games like pro skater 4 and Underground having legendary sound tracks I expected more from this remake.\n\nOver all its an Okay game 7/10.

That's probably because I've loved the soundtrack to most Tony Hawk's games and played them all when they were originally released.\n\nIf you're a skater you will love this game as it has all the technical elements of skating and all the big names within the sport. If you're not a big skater you will still love this game as the controls are easy to pick up and it's a lot of fun pulling off big tricks that you only ever see on TV.\n\nAgain this is one of those games that has been given the HD treatment and it works, bringing life back to the game franchise and making it a more enjoyable experience than playing the original.","June 20, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And on top of that put several missions in that weren't available in their native games.\nThe progress system is a hybrid between THPS and THPS2. The stats are Money based with each point being more pricey than the last. While the level unlock is based on # of missions completed.\nThe gameplay imports to the Unreal 3 engine remarkably well. The functions not supported by an XB360/PS3 controller are minimal and tolerable/ignorable, just being a few menu options. The controller macro is intuitive and will feel second nature to anyone who played these games when they were on their native systems. Other than Left Stick support that the first 2 lacked (at least on PSX) the macro is identical, or at least nearly so. There are very few if any bugs. The "Big Drop" mechanic can get kind of annoying, but that's been the case since the mechanic's induction into the series.\nThere are of course some, admittedly nitpickey, downsides to the game. The unlock system takes away what little non-linearity the classic games had, as in you could do the levels in any order as long as you met the unlock requirements. Here, though, the unlocks are based on missions in the previous level, so you have to do them in order.\nIf you really liked the PSX/PS2 games in the series, or you want to get into the series proper, or got introduced with underground or later, this is definitely worth the $10.","September 23, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game itself is visually appealing, but I am dissapointed that the only option in the graphics menu is the ability to alter the resolution, this is a little shabby for a modern PC port. The selection of levels is OK, although personally I feel they could have added a few more to the mix, such as downtown minneapolis from THPS1, Skate street from THPS2. My only problem with the levels is that some of them haven't been adapted to the new game engine, meaning that certain gaps and goals are now more difficult to achieve than in the original games, one of the main examples of this is the venice beach level in which certain gaps and goals have had their difficulty unneccessarily increased, this down to the fact that your skater moves slower than in the classic games. The new engine is nice and it feels like they tried to emulate the THPS3 engine but with more realistic movement, however the game will sometimes throw you off your board even if you don't bail, this can be annoying when trying to get a high score. I'm not too bothered about the lack of multiplayer but local multiplayer/splitscreen would have been an asset here. I'm also dissapointed that you can't dismount your board in order to look around a level in order to find certain goals like in the THUG games. In conclusion it has potential but it feels rushed, it feels like they spent more time porting the levels and making all the movements seem hyper realistic that they forgot to see whether or not their game actually worked properly.\n\ntl;dr, buy this if its on sale like I did, otherwise stick to the older games as THUG, THUG-2 and THAW all feature updated versions of the classic levels","May 1, 2014","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The physics and board handling are pretty dire for a modern skateboarding simulation game.\n\nI have been a fan of the Tony Hawk's games since the early 2000's when I first got my hands on the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (or Tony Hawk's Skateboarding as it was known in the UK and other PAL regions)  back in roughly 2000. I have played every PlayStation instalment since the first game with the exception of the HD games and the motion controlled Ride and Shred games.\n\nRecently I have been emulating the hell out of all these games using PCSX2 here on my PC and FPSE on my OUYA so I can make direct comparisons here and not rely on 10 year old memories. These games are older and they are outright better.\n\nOnce you get over the questionable menu and HUD design (is Clarendon really the most appropriate typeface for the UI here?), no XBOX button prompts when using a gamepad,  the lack of some of my favourite pro skaters (no Chad Muska or  Mike Vallely) and most importantly the game's physics and board handling.\n\nThe physics and board handling really let me down, that is to me the most important parts of any skateboard simulation game out there. I will tell you the game handles a lot like Grind Session did back in 2000. Between the ollies, grinding and the bails. It feels like a game from 14-15 years ago gameplay wise.\n\nAs for the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, 3 and 4 which this game is designed to pay homage to, they handle so much better and they are so much older. Don't believe me, give them a whirl. If you can get over the outdated graphics, the gameplay is still very solid on those games.\n\nThere are a few positives though.  First off, the game's UI while being hit and miss, does make a few hits. I like the addition of a level map in the pause menu, although it isn't that useful when I have played all of the levels so many times in the past (there are NO original levels in this game). Also I like the progress meter for the goals which is think is pretty sleek in this version. I like how it greys out the missing SKATE letters.\n\nAlso the graphics and visual effects are pretty nice, helped by the power of the Unreal Engine 3. It is interesting to see old levels that haven't had a modern graphical update for the last decade get some love, I like daylight effects used in the Warehouse level and I like the addition of a dome in the Mall level from THPS, it's a nice touch.\n\nAlso I love the soundtrack. A few of the classics from the original THPS games have made it to the game's OST including Millencolin - No Cigar, Public Enemy feat. - Bring the Noise and Powerman 5000 - When World's Collide. They always sound great, classic songs. In addition there are new songs too to make a nice balanced playlist.\n\nThe addition of achievements ,albeit just 15 is a nice addition and will definitely motivate me to continue playing this game for some time.  I'll see how many I'll get before I am bored.\n\nFinally the lack of multiplayer is understandable for a $9.99 (£8.99) title. It would have been a nice addition to play these levels with local or online multiplayer with game modes like Horse, Free Skate and Graffiti. But I don't blame Robomodo for omitting it, probably due to time and budget restraints.\n\nTo conclude, the game just doesn't handle well enough to give me a nostalgia kick. It irritates me more than it excites me. I guess it's up to Neversoft to make a solid Tony Hawk game like they did in the past all the way up to Project 8 (which was alright). This game doesn't get a recommendation from me, because the other games emulate perfectly and you should be playing them instead.","May 1, 2014","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Somone new to the series would most likely enjoy this remake but others familiar with the original series tony hawk's pro skater 1,2,3,4 and THUG series would most likely be disappointed. The game is more of a remake of 1,2,3,4 on a new engine with missing essential elements to the original series. Acid drops, spine transfers, manual tricks  (EX truckstand, casper) are completly missing. Players also looking for the THUG experience with a new story should stay away from this game or expect less. Setting options are also a downside to this game. Not having any other settings is also a downside. This clearly show's the game is a straight console port looking exactly like the PS3 version. This is not a real downside but being the PC version I expected a bit more. Also the sound setting for the Effects are completly broken I found my self turning down the SFX volume yet having the sound effects of Cars and breaking object completly blasting my ears even with everything else turned down. Ended up turning off the sound manualy in windows. Speaking of sound berely having any tracks may cause some people to just mute their in game music and play their own which is what I do but for $10 bucks its unexceptable. Also older Tony Hawk games like pro skater 4 and Underground having legendary sound tracks I expected more from this remake.\n\nOver all its an Okay game 7/10.

A long time ago, a friend of mine owned THPS on his PS1. It was fun to play every now and then when I visited, but he became amazing at the game. Watching him get all the achievements was frustrating and fun. I was happy with my Nintendo collection, for sure, but I always wanted to own THPS on a console that would make it more responsive and, especially, look better; So when I saw THPSHD, I knew right away that the game was gonna be a real hair pulling, multi-screaming event in my life.. and it hasn't disappointed at all. The down-side is the DLC of James Hetfield. I for one do NOT like Jim at all and it's an interesting element to know I have to complete the game with him one of these days. If I'm smart, I'll stop all my other work and just go do The Het straight away to get him finished. The soundtrack is a bit lacking (as are the options for music..), but that's just me being a fool. The game is all about "challenge" and THPSHD certainly delivers on THAT front. I've been having an awesome time playing the game. I think just about anyone who is into unlocking stuff and perfecting game challenges will like this game. In its own cohesive way it's a sport/puzzle game. It has (for me) just the right type of frustration; it is a real "damn.. so close" and "WHAT!? NO WAY!? I WENT RIGHT THROUGH THAT! RIPPED OFF!" kinda game. It instills that wonderful fun of having to stay focussed and confident - you'll end up staying on a really difficult section of the game just to GET IT DONE. Eventually, the game opens some really fun cheat modes (which is always cool) and your mind can get confused as to exactly WHY a player should buy all those skateboards - but, so help me, I need everything in the game.. just to see if I can do it. I think it's a fantastic rendition of the older types; loads of fun and frustration.

It's cheap and I played 2 on PC yonks ago so I thought why not. To be fair, it's very true to the original, and while this is partly a compliment, I'm sure nobody who plays skating games will tell you they're easy. Maybe I was just better at it back then because it's one of the few games I owned, but it's just way too difficult! I can't even begin to comprehend how to get some of the objectives the game has, I fall on my ♥♥♥ over and over and there's just not enough time on the level to get any good amount of points. I'm sure I could get better if I tried hard enough, but why would I, really? The controls are just too flawed for a PC interface, and everything happens so fast that I'm just not up to the task that I was ten years ago.","September 29, 2012","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Aside from a few minor changes and an HD repainting it's the same N64 classic you knew and loved (with an unfortunate reminder of downhill jam by a map of the same name to make sure too much fun isn't had).\n\nAll in all it's a great piece of retro revival from a genre that was killed by those that made it popular.

This helps you get better combos and carry on your trick for a better score and ultimately more fun. The game is great for skateboard fans but also for anyone really. I wasnt a skateboard fan but i loved the game and found it easy to get into and had lots of fun. Not much has changed from the originals really apart from a graphics overhall.

I used to skate years ago and the physics on this game felt real and if you mess up you are punished accordingly, after about 20-30 minutes of getting used to the physics that just beat the pants out of all other skateboarding games I was back to hitting all the high scores and busting out insane combo's whilst having an even better time than I had in any of it's predecessors.\n\nBest purchase I have made in years, when I said  very realistic I meant that in gfx and physics aswell as how it actually feels when you take off of a ramp and line up the landing the charecters movement are almost completely flawless and in alot of cases I found the movements perfected and they left in the rediculous obsurd jumps, rail and ledges that keep it fun which is why it is still a game and not a sim although they aren't far off.","February 19, 2015","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have played all of them up to THPS:U and as such, I know them inside and out. The mechanics feel a little off in this game. I often find myself glitching through rails while grinding, or glitching the screen while getting too high on a half pipe. Overall, it's a good game for what it is, and it's worth the less than 20 dollar price... on any system other than PC.\nThe PC version has two fatal flaws. When using a controller, the on screen button icons display as PC controls, rather than xbox controls. So, new players who choose the xbox control scheme will feel very disoriented. Also, the 360 version of the game has multiplayer and leaderboards, but this version does not.\nI purchased this game for 5 dollars when it was on sale, looking forward to multiplayer. For only 5 dollars, it isn't a bad purchase. But if I'd payed 10 dollars only to discover no multiplayer, I would have been cursing.\nIf the button icon issue won't bother you either because you only use pc controls, or you know the xbox control scheme by heart, and you have no interest in multiplayer or leaderboards anyway, then go ahead and grab the PC version. It's five dollars cheaper than the console, and you get the Metallica vocalist  himself as a character, and a Metallica song included in the game as a PC exclusive.\n","May 5, 2014","false","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some of these elements can be found in this HD remake of a small selection of levels and songs from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 brought back from the dead with the voodoo of the Unreal Engine which as usual does an admirable job even after so many years. The classics don't lose their magic and you will keep finding new lines and combos even after years (and I should know, I've been playing the series since 1999) however the selection of levels and songs is rather small and the levels themselves aren't big either, because they were designed with the limitations of late nineties consoles. There is not much to do here,a tiny assortment of gameplay modes that each eschew any sort of invitation to play them for more than a few rounds. A tiny amount of purely cosmetic unlockables, play it through once, never pick it up again. There's also no multiplayer on PC.\n\nThis anorexic approach to game design is further mangled by a failed revamping of the gameplay. The new physics engine lacks the tight and fluid control that the series is known for. There are no ways to change key bindings in-game, the process to change the .ini files is lengthy and tedious for anyone not playing with the xbox controller and even then the controls just seem off or wobbly for lack of a more technical term. Graphical settings are handled in the same shoddy manner. ini or die.\n\nTHPS HD comes off as the final lazy attempt to cash in on the last breath of a dead series. Namesake Tony Hawk always seemed very sincere about the series he helped create and connected it deeply in skate culture, but here they just dropped the ball so hard it tunneled miles past where the catastrophic Tony Hawk's Shred and Ride finally came to rest covered in money glued on with the tears of children who got them as christmas gifts.\n\nThere's no real market for this game. Old fans will be disappointed, newcomers will be turn off their computer in frustration. If you want to play the series again or the first time on PC, there are so many better options. Tony Hawk's Underground 1 and 2 run well on modern systems because of a dedicated modding community, THPS 2 to 4 were also released on PC. Even buying the first two games on playstation for the estimated 2 bucks they will cost you and firing up an emulator will get you a better experience overall and better introduction to a great series of times past, filled with hours upon hours of highly addictive fun.","January 17, 2015","false","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game ran in beautiful 60fps on unreal engine. I really enjoyed how crisp the animations were when doing grabs, tricks, jumps etc. It was very realistic, yet unreleastic to follow the theme of the original Tony Hawk Proskater series.\nThe only two problems I had with it was its lack of "online mode" which wasn't featured in the PC port apparently, and the ragdoll when falling off the board. Overall it was still fun for the single player experience + the unlockables.

And you can't even change the music playlist, if you hate a certain song, then you better learn to deal with it because you can't do anything about it.\n\nIf you asked anybody what their favorite thing about the Pro Skater games was, I can guarantee you they won't say "The part where you were timed and had to complete stupid glitchy goals over and over"; but that's ALL this port/remake is.\nYou'd be better off just finding your old Playstation and hooking it up  for an afternoon rather than just being sorely disappointed for half an hour with this game.","February 15, 2015","false","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But unfortunately, the words "crappy port" do not even begin to cover this game. The singular graphic option is changing what resolution you want to play in. You can not select what music tracks you do and do not want to play. The UI is not well designed in my opinion. There really should have been seperate sub-menus for the career, and free-skate modes, while single session should have been right on the main menu. The gameplay changes are small but noticeable, although I would have liked it better had they just kept everything the same from the first few games. If you really want to play THPS on PC, your best bet is to pruchase a copy of Tony Hawk's Underground 1,2 or any of the original THPS trilogy.","May 4, 2014","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics aren't the best for an HD remake, they could of done better. More importantly, the feel of the game is somewhat worse than the classic versions.

Performance is sub-par and content is quite lacking considering it's a supposed 'remaster' of both THPS1 and 2. That said, it's not the worst Tony Hawk game I've played. Graphically it looks pretty good and while the gameplay has been subtly yet frustratingly tampered with, taking away some of the original's feel, the gameplay works fine most of the time. Lack of multiplayer (that was present in the console version) is a disappointing part of the PC port, as both the local and online multiplayer in the Tony Hawk games is widely considered to be one of the most important aspects, which makes it even more baffling why they'd only remove it, let alone from just one version of the game.\n\nI think Robomodo got pulled into the Tony Hawk franchise with too little experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SonicTWDKenny/recommended/207210/","SonicTWDKenny","TWD Kenny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SonicTWDKenny/","205 products in account","Before you judge my review on my hilariously low play time, hear me out- I played this game on Xbox 360 for quite some time; then I moved to PC (I actually pirated it because of how bad I heard it was), and then here we are now. So I've certainly had my run through this game, many times. That being said, let me get into it.\n\nSo I've been a THPS fan ever since I was a kid. As many people did, I started out on THPS 2 and went forwards (yes I did play THPS 1, but the disc got scratched to hell so I never got to finish it...). I absolutely adored skating; so much that I took a passion for it irl. Although I was a skater in real life, I always loved skating in video games better because I can't do tricks worth s hit. Regardless, I think like a skater and I know how a skating game should work.\n\nTHPS HD was such a GREAT idea that was pitched in 2012, but sadly, it just didn't deliver. The game often crashed for me when I played the pirated version, but I didn't experience any crashes on the legal version. The only two things that I absolutely hate about this game are the 1. 720p auto downsample and 2. The screen tearing is VERY BAD. Regarding the downsample- the game WILL run in 1920x1080 resolution, but the textures can only be seen at 1240x720, which makes textures and objects look pretty horrid. Did I also mention that the rendering for lots of objects and models take 5 more seconds than they should? Because they do. And it pisses me off sometimes. Regarding the screen tearing- THPS HD is VERY bad with this. Leaning to the left or to the right when going moderately fast is just an eyeful of what looks like my screen ripping itself in half. It's just so bad to look at sometimes, and it almost makes me nautious looking at it. There's no Vsync option neither, so that's no fun.\n\nRegarding the physics of the HD remake- they're mediocre and need fine tuning. The grind collision between your character and the rail is absolutely horrible; sometimes, it's like you're 10 feet away from the rail, but yet you'll float to the rail if you press the grind key. While this can help in some situations, it's still pretty annoying when you're trying to make a REALISTIC game. I might also add that the biggest problem with the physics is the bailing. Sometimes you will completely 100% land a trick, but completely bail out instead. Same thing can happen with grinding rails and/or awkwardly hitting a vert ramp.\n\nWhile the arcade gameplay was an ABSOLUTE blast from the past, it was basically the only thing that gave me serious nostalgia other than the levels and OST.\n\nI forgot to mention that the OST is the same exact one from THPS 1, which is a BIG plus. I think that's one of my most favorite parts of the game- jamming out to old tunes from one of the greatest games of all time.\n\nOther than the OST and levels, this game doesn't have much going for it. It's got the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ physics engine from THPS 5, and we all know how cancerous THPS 5 was. The skater selection is very scearce and the board shop is agrugably the worst in the entire franchise. There is no character customization, no level creater, nothing. It's just strictly  Arcade, Free Skate, and several other modes that are unlocked. If this game had more to it and didn't charge $4.99 for a few levels that SHOULD have been added in as FREE DLC, I think I would give it the benefit of the doubt and give it a good-ish review, but this game just has far too many issues and should be repolished before ever coming into the Steam marketplace. I've seen Early Access games perform and function better than THPS HD.\n\nI bought this game on sale for $4.99, which is relatively cheap and I don't really feel cheated out of my money, so I'm not going to refund. I'm certainly happy with this game just because of all the nostalgia it brings back and it being the only REAL 3D skateboarding game on PC (OlliOlli doesn't count because it's 2D). Bottom line; buy this game when it's on sale. I would regret paying $19.99 for this game on any retail day.","February 23","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I first came to the series with Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 so I had not played most of these levels before but the ones I did recognise looked great revamped in HD. The game features Tony Hawk, Rodney Mullen and all the other characters I have either never heard or completely forgotten about since I last played one of these games. The skating and career mode are great fun. There are a few other game modes but they are mediocre. The characters’ gurning and bizarrely erratic rag-doll physics are hilarious. The music fits my expectations and there are a few gems in there. My only problem is that being more familiar with the later games I really miss some of the tricks not in this game.

Performance is sub-par and content is quite lacking considering it's a supposed 'remaster' of both THPS1 and 2. That said, it's not the worst Tony Hawk game I've played. Graphically it looks pretty good and while the gameplay has been subtly yet frustratingly tampered with, taking away some of the original's feel, the gameplay works fine most of the time. Lack of multiplayer (that was present in the console version) is a disappointing part of the PC port, as both the local and online multiplayer in the Tony Hawk games is widely considered to be one of the most important aspects, which makes it even more baffling why they'd only remove it, let alone from just one version of the game.\n\nI think Robomodo got pulled into the Tony Hawk franchise with too little experience.

Each character has their own special ability, for instance Rodney Mullen is great at doing manuals in the game while other characters may not be as good. The levels to the game are taken from THPS and it’s sequel THPS2, ranging from a hangar to a mall. The music can get quiet annoying and repetitive throughout the levels.\n\nWhen you are playing through the objective mode, the levels can seem monotonous since all your doing is tricks and collecting things. On some stages its really fun to do the objectives but on others, not so much. If you get tired of doing the same old objectives, you can take a break in Free Skate mode. I actually find that mode to be somewhat relaxing. There are a few other modes like one where you have to follow a certain path doing a certain kind of trick.\n\nThere is one DLC pack that adds some more mechanics, stages, and characters from THPS3.\n\nOverall, I like the game. It does have its issues like the repetitiveness, but it has plenty of redeeming qualities like fun gameplay.\n\nI rate this game a 8/10\n\nFor more reviews like this one, head over to my game review blog here: www.gonemadgaming.com\n\n~rhillfake\n\n3DS Friend Code: 2595-3048-4554 || Steam\Origin\Other: rhillfake || Xbox Live: WasBottlehead99","December 5, 2015","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Buy it to support the concept of Tony Hawk's games on PC, buy it for a couple hours of quick fun, buy it for some nostalgic bliss. DO NOT buy it if you're hoping for a next gen installment of THPS. The graphics are quite good, actually, but the controls are impossible to master, and theres a lot of stuff that it is missing. Namly, wall/sticker slaps. It's very difficult to keep a beast combo going without wall slaps. Moreover, there doesn't appear to be spine transfers, but in their place there is an unreliable action notice when you transfer. You can't get off your board, but that's more of a luxury anyways.

It's a cheap nostalgia grab with loose controls, inaccurate physics to the originals, weird glitches, and it has less features than EVEN THE FIRST GAME. (Seriously, there isn't even a Skip Track button.) The THPS3 DLC is awful too. Robomodo couldn't be bothered to do the extra scripting required for the original THPS3 missions, so most of them are replaced with THPS2-esque collect-a-thon goals. There were plans for more DLC, but they were cancelled after the game's negative reception. It's much better than Ride/Shred, but that's like saying getting impaled is better than getting a limb chopped off.\n\nOnly good thing I can say about this game is that the soundtrack is alright. The new songs are good and the old songs are good picks too. Except for one thing: There's only one THPS1 song. I get that licensing is hard, but I highly doubt it would've been a huge deal to get the rights to The Ernies, Vandals, or The Suicide Machines.

Buy it to support the concept of Tony Hawk's games on PC, buy it for a couple hours of quick fun, buy it for some nostalgic bliss. DO NOT buy it if you're hoping for a next gen installment of THPS. The graphics are quite good, actually, but the controls are impossible to master, and theres a lot of stuff that it is missing. Namly, wall/sticker slaps. It's very difficult to keep a beast combo going without wall slaps. Moreover, there doesn't appear to be spine transfers, but in their place there is an unreliable action notice when you transfer. You can't get off your board, but that's more of a luxury anyways. When I was very little, I played THPS 3, but I really grew up playing the Underground games, but still, I'm certain this game is using an old engine, from one of the first couple games.","April 15","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
