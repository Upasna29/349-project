It's very very odd. It's also dark, disturbing, messed up, scary, and freaking hilarious. And of course, it's good, and you should buy it the moment after you read this review.\n\nAlso, people who say Dark Souls is hard obviously haven't played this. Oddworld is basically Dark Souls if were a puzzle platformer with VERY tense stealth sections, only it's MUCH harder. You will get frustrated often, but once you succeed, you'll feel like a total champion.","June 6, 2015","true","15.2"," 161 of 183 people (88%) found this review helpful 50 people found this review funny","88","161","183","50","5"

THIS GAME CAN BE DIFFICULT!\n\nBut, AH! The memories! :D\n\nThe protagonist of this memorable tale is named Abe. A Mudokon who was born a slave and works for RuptureFarms, a meat processing factory. One day Abe discovers that he and his kind are to be sent to the slaughterhouse. Not only that, they will soon become the "new & tasty" delicasy on the menu! He decides that he better make a break from the Glukkons who hold him captive and decides to rescue as many of his fellow Mudokons as he can along the way.\nAnd so, his unexpected quest begins!\n\nThere are a total of 99 Mudokons that await liberation. Some of them you really have to look for and there are a bunch of hidden rooms to find them in. Abe must rescue at least 50 of his kinfolk in order to survive the games ending. At times it can be a demanding task with little or no room for mistake to succeed. The game offers a very steep learning curve and rewards you with silly characters, enjoyable scenery, great music (which can and will become annoying when you get stuck), comical yet very well done cutscenes and most importantly, you will experience a fun and satisfying time overall.\n\nPROS:\n+ A hilariously alluring story line that draws from a serious matter concerning slavery\n+ Fantastic character design and visual concepts\n+ Nice graphics and animations (originally released in 1997 and it still looks pretty good)\n+ Lots of secret rooms to discover\n+ Innovative gameplay that will fulfill your desires for a real challenge\n\nCONS:\n- The save feature is not what you'd hope for in a game this grueling (you must reach checkpoints which means you better look forward to replaying strenuous parts over and over, again and again... and again)\n- There is no incentive for saving all 99 Mudokons (except for a video that was only featured in the original Playstation version)\n- I broke at least one Playstation controller during a rage quit\n\nI remember all the excitement of 3D gaming with the PS1 and still choosing to suffer this brutal sidescrolling platformer in 2D because the game is just so intriguingly awesome. One that still stands compelling to this day. I'd definitely recommend it. A replay even, for nostalgic purposes at least, if you're a gamer of the day. And it's absolutely worth a "taste" if Mudokon is new to you!\n\nMy personal rating: 8.5/10","August 30, 2014","true","18.2"," 86 of 89 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","86","89","3","9"

There is much that can be said about this particular gem of a game, good challange, great fun and a lot of old fashioned slapstick humor.\nAs I play this game I start to reminice, reminice about the old times long past; it began in 1990- something, when I was just an inexperienced youngling with the world ahead of me. I had never heard much of games, save the windows 95 classics such as minesweeper and the like. I remember the cold winter evening when I sat behind the window, about a week earlier we got a letter saying that my father was honorably discharged from the frontlines, and that he would return home.\nHe had fought the swedes in the attempt to secure Norways freedom. I saw a shade move into the garden, the sound of footsteps pressing their way into the wast snow on the ground. I ran to the door to find my father standing there, standing so proud, yet humble in his fusilier uniform, the musket over his shoulder, and a smile of joy visible through his thick beard. As he stepped into the house I saw a strange gray box in his left hand, a box that would later change my life.\nMe and my father played many an hour, many games with this gray box, but the first we ever played was Abe's Oddysee.\nIt was this game that I played in these dark times, and when I played I knew that some day there would be peace.\n\nIt also has a great sequel!","October 19, 2014","true","3.3"," 51 of 57 people (89%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","89","51","57","9","8"

Abes oddysee still has a great visual aesthetic that marks its world as it's own, and still oozes charm amidst it's meat factory dread. The puzzle platforming rescuing the slaved mudokons has aged terribly without the ability to quicksave, and you will find yourself fighting against some bad design choices and trial and death gameplay which is more punishing than rewarding. As relic of the of the past, it's still worth playing to the end, but you would be suprised how much gameplay has improved over the years, so newcomers might be better persuaded into getting the modern remake.\n\nI played this as a kid back when it first released, and playing it now, I found a lot more context in oddworld. There's an enviromentalist message amidst it's grim take on overconsumption and capitalism.\n\nPROS:\nFeels like an adventure\nDifficult puzzles\nGreat style, a very immersive world\n\nCONS:\nNo quicksave, puzzles can frustrate\nThe platforming has dated, unresponsive.\nrequires dedication to save the only obvious 50 mudokons. 50 are in very well hidden locations, and 50 is the cap for the good ending.

For the most part it's difficult but fare, with your success coming down to timing, preparation, and patience, making each success all the more satisfying, even I'm still convinced the jump button stops working every now and then just to troll you (that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it). The 2 main problems with it, then, are the fail states and the save system - deaths (which are VERY frequent) are met with prolonged musical cues and delays before starting the levels again, and there's no way of telling just how far back a reloaded saved-game is going to take you.\nIf you can get over those two major problems, it's definitely worth checking out for the puzzles and interesting world alone.

The story is a fantastic example of handling serious issues without being preachy, never forgetting to be fun and amusing. The blend of 2D stealth, puzzling and platforming gameplay is just about perfect, and challenging without being excessively punishing. The controls are similar to Tomb Raider, in that they are very precise; they follow strict rules, and your every move is calculable. The visuals are also pushed to the absolute limits of the PlayStation; you won't find any polygons in this one, and the cutscene-to-gameplay transitions are so seamless it's uncanny.\n\nThe only reasonable gripe I can see people having with it is the difficulty. The game is not without its trial and error, for sure, and this game lacks the quicksave option of Exoddus. I've heard some describe its challenge as ranging from "unreasonable" to "impossible." On the front of the old PlayStation jewel case, you'll even see it blantantly say it has "inexplicably challenging gameplay," and all you have to deal with that is a functional brain and infinite lives (you'll need them.) Oh, and magical powers. The game might have "forgotten" to tell you that until the third level... whoops. Yes, all this game teaches you are the basics. There isn't much hand-holding, and you will likely get the bad ending on your first playthrough. However, you will get a chance to fix that, starting from the beginning of the final level. This was certainly a deliberate design decision. If you have reservations about the difficulty of this game, play Exoddus first, for the quicksave, and an even larger game.","December 16, 2013","true","8.2"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

This was what started the Oddworld franchise that since that year has seen several sequels.\n\nThese games are all about Abe, the titular character, who is a Mudokon slave being captive in a factory. Initially just a worker, but later labelled as "meat to be processed", Abe sets out to escape from his captors and also to free his fellow Mudokons in the process. The game's first cutscene (which is pretty long considering it is an old game) summarises the story very well and we can quickly understand what's ahead of us.\n\nThis is a 2D platformer, so we go from screen to screen and every new "room" represents a new challenge. We have patrolling enemies as well as traps and of course members of the Mudokon race who we need to rescue. We can issue some basic commands to them to make sure they follow us - this part where you communicate with the others can be hilarious.\n\nDo note that this is one of those games where one mistake can lead to certain death. Checkpoints are regularly placed, though, so at least the game is not punishing you for being a little careless from time to time. One particularly interesting thing is how you can make other Mudokons die if you are not careful - the game does not take you back to the last checkpoint so you may think this is not a problem. Truth is, the number of saved Mudokons determines the ending of the game - you can either get the Good or the Bad ending.\n\nThe gameplay is really good - Abe can do a lot of things in terms of movement and activating various mechanisms throughout the factory. Sections tend to get more and more difficult but Oddworld offers an acceptable learning curve here. I haven't tried the remake so I do not know how good a job they did - still, if you like old games or you are, just like myself, someone having played this back in the '90s do give it a try once more!","May 7","true","1.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE! amazing atmosphere thanks to the the visuals and the music which sets the scene really well. the only problem that i had with the game i that i didnt know i could possess sligs or save the mudokons at the start of the game (maybe i missed something? probably...) which caused me to have the bad ending. which was not necessarily a problem since i couldn't stop thinking about this game after the last cutscene. While replaying it was kinda a drag just for the sake of the good ending, doesn't mean it wasn't a blast!

Like games with lots of secrets? Need a challenge? Then Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee is the game for you. Abe's Oddysee is a 2D sidescrolling cinematic platformer/puzzle game (phew!) with some interesting twists.\n\nStory: You are Abe, a mudokon who works on Rupture Farms. Abe lives a great life, despite being a slave. One day, while roaming the area, Abe finds that Glukkons (the scumbag rich species of Oddworld) want to turn mudokons into food. Abe, finding that out, decides that the best thing to do is save the 99 mudokons in Rupture Farms. Your journey won't be easy, because deadly enemies are almost everywhere.\n\nGameplay: As I said before, this is a 2D platformer. The game is divided in screens (fixed camera, i,e., go to the right edge of the screen and it moves to the next camera/play area). This system gives the player a sense of suspense, because you never know what's in the next screen. One of the powers Abe has is possessing his enemies. Press the button, wait some seconds, you are controlling the enemy. You can do almost everything with him (kill him, kill other enemies, pull levers, fall off a cliff, you name it!) and it's an helpful power to finish your journey. There is a basic speaking system called GameSpeak that allows to control other mudokons using basic sentences (Hi!, Follow me, wait and even farting!). Mudokons must be moved using this system and taken to the nearest bird portal. Just chant and voila! The portal opens and they're saved! (:D) Unless... they trip on a mine. ( :( ) The only problem this game has in terms of gameplay is that checkpoints are infrequent and sometimes you will have to do same thing again and again only to die in the same place.\n\nGraphics: Even though some screens look 3D, they are actually pre-rendered. The environments are beautiful and varied.\n\nSound: The soundtrack adds to the atmosphere, and the sound effects are pretty good.\n\nFinal thoughts: Despite the somewhat dated graphics, Oddworld is an amazing game. The story is amazing, the gameplay is easy to learn and hard to master, and the soundtrack is pretty good.\n\n** If you are playing this game in Windows Vista, 7 or 8, be sure to download this and put in the game's folder. The game has some incompatibility issues in recent Windows versions: http://koti.mbnet.fi/vaultec/files/miscellaneous/ddhack_abe.zip **","November 27, 2013","true","3.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

This time I got so much more absorbed into the game. It's a great game. There's so much to explore and do, and the puzzles can be really quite challenging if you want to rescue all the Mudokons.

Your goal as Abe is saving your species the Modokons to safety so they don't end up as food for the bad guy and his species. The graphics and controls may be a little outdated by todays standard (the graphics more than a little), but it doesn't matter. It's still a great game, with lots of humour. It has a special kind of charm that makes game simply work, both in 1997 and now.

The cinematic style of this game has always astounded me even to this day, the games visual style still holds up today which is good for a playstation one era game. From the dark, dirty factories of Rupture farms to the vast plains of Scrabania, this game is an absoloute pleasure to look at no matter where you go.\n\nThe gameplay is another one of this games strongpoints. The game focuses around controlling Abe, trying to escape Rupture Farms and save his Mudokon brothers from slavery by the Glukkons. The gameplay focuses around avoiding your adverseries by any means necessary, as Abe doesnt have a way to attack but that is where possesion comes in.\n\nThe controls are amazingly responsive, no real delay or anything which is an essential requirement for a sidescrolling platfromer of this type and Oddwolrd Inhabitants hit the nail on the head with this one. Abe controls just how he should, your main controls are the usual things such as running, sneaking jumping etc.\n\nThe tone of the game is also fantastic. The game has a dark overtone through the whole experience, showing how Oddworld is changing and not in a good way. But the game is sort of lightened up with the characters that are presented to us throughout the full game. All the characters are likable in this game in their own way. The Sligs, The Glukkons, The Mudokons and especially Abe himself.\n\nOddworld Inhabitants managed to create a character that was relatable in his own way, a character that was innocent enough but has been dropped into a situation that is so much bigger than he is. Oddworld Inhabitants have crafted a masterpiece here and i would recommend this game to anybody who loves platformers, action games or even stealth games.\n\nMy only complaints have to be the checkpoint system is irritating, with checkpoints being very scarce and this game being very unforgiving with one hit deaths, learning puzzles can be rather difficult. Also not being able to call upon more than one Mudokon at once is kind of annoying. Luckily both of these issues have been fixed in the sequal.\n\nAbe's Oddysee still holds up today and is still one of my favourite games to date and a fantastic addition to the platforming genre. 8/10","April 30, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Abe's  Oddysee is the first Oddworld game released, and the first one I ever played way back on the PlayStation 1. Oddworld games are always filled with dark comedy, the Oddworld games always manage to keep a sense of adventure coupled with a macabre feel that I just love.\n\nIn Abe's Oddysee you play a character named Abe, a Mudokon slave worker who uncovers a nefarious plot that could lead to the death of his people. He sets out on a quest to free them, slowly uncovering more of his Mudokon culture along the way.  Gameplay wise Abe's Oddysee is a 2D platformer filled with puzzles and obstacles to complete or circumvent, but remember the ending is dependent on how well you do.\n\nOverall I would recommend Oddworld games to anyone who is a fan of adventure or puzzle games. Oddworld is one of those series that feels really unique, so you'd be challenged to find something close enough to the Oddworld games.","September 24, 2015","true","18.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

BUT not to worry, if you have a playstation game pad for the PC you can hook it up and play this game to your hearts content ... well ... you could do it already if you have a keyboard, but this game is made with a controller in mind so it would only improve on this already fantastic game.\nnot to mention how you save game, just pause and save and you're done ... come back when you've decided you won't rage quit over how challenging the game is ... forgot to mention that actually. This game is incredibly unforgiving. one wrong move and "BOOM" ... you're blue paste gets splattered all over the screen, and you're left to think about what would happen to your green comrades if you could not re-spawn ... a banjo kazooie 'quit game ending if you will.\n\nit doesn't do that, i'm just saying thinking about it is weird ... what if they all get eaten and they sell your organs for dog food, humanity goes into a downward spiral as events you couldn't stop, happen. The sequels always end with the sad ending, and you're no where to be seen because you died 2 games ago, nobody even knows your name anymore. As a slag (animal) begins to munch on your tinned mudoken fingers and eyeballs, the last sentient part of you is converted into fecal matter and your race DIES ... all because you took one step to the right and got crushed by a barrel of meat ... but i digress\n\nSTORY-\nthe story to this game is essentially one giant Eco friendly metaphor for our own industrial prowess ... but it is so subtle/just plain ignorable that it will not rest on your conscience at all. basically you're an actual "skrub" worker in the biggest meat factory on odd-world, your bosses want to kill and sell your race to (possibly) unwary, cannibalistic consumers (it's never specified who actually buys all this food). you get found out, chase scene happens, voodoo hoodoo guy with funny mask gives you powers, and you basically take off from there. the story is a lot more in-depth than that but, meh. it would spoil a lot of the lot to go into full detail (I'M DOING THIS FOR YOU, THE PURCHASER OF THIS FINE PRODUCT! DON'T HATE ME!)\n\nGRAPHICS-\nIt's a ps1 game, so you can expect some ... aging, to take place. it's a side scroller from the 90's so its 32 bit graphic style will always hold up pretty well (if you're a forgiving sort of person who enjoys game play over graphics). it's not the worst game you will ever see in your life ... it definitely gives some 3D games i know of a run for there money.\n\nOVERALL-\ni would definitely recommend that you buy this game, as a matter of fact, just buy the entire Oddbox bundle. you get all the Odd-world games for £6.99 (when not on sale). that is a steal for anyone's library as they are all definitely worth purchasing. strangers wrath although not as popular as other Odd-world title is definitely commendable for a referral as well.","January 1, 2015","true","3.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dunnace/recommended/15700/","dunnace","Carnage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dunnace/","343 products in account","There are few games that can get a person like me misty eyed, but Abe's Oddysee is one of them. To say I have a strong fondness of this game is an understatement; to say I love it still falls short of the entire truth; in fact, any attempt to compose a sentence from the English language expressing how much I admire this game would still miss the mark entirely. When I think about the amazing land of Oddworld filled with Mudokons and Scrabs and... what's that? What's a Mudokon? Oh ho ho, sit down dear child, and listen, listen well, for I have a tale to tell...\n\nOddworld: Abe's Oddysee (and that is spelled correctly, by the way, it's 'odd'ysee - get it?) is set in the surreal Oddworld, a dystopia where industrial giants destroy the land and enslave the hapless race of Mudokons in order to inflate profit margins; all the while driving races to extinction and marring the pristine surroundings. Sound familiar? Well, that's where the similarity ends, because Mudokons are green alien-looking dudes with sewn lips and the ability to possess certain animals. The industrialists are Glukkons; tall, armless, cigar smokers who wear smart sleeveless suits and have sinister glowing red eyes. The foreboding atmosphere is buttressed by an even more disturbing and darkly comical plot.\n\nAbe, Mudokon 'employee' of the month, is busy waxing the floor of the meat processing giant Rupture Farms when he overhears a board meeting being held by the meanest, most ruthless Glukkon in Oddworld: Molluck. Profits are down because of the steadily declining wildlife they use to create their foodstuffs and the shareholders are going nuts. Molluck calmly divulges his nefarious plan to the wary board members: to save his meat packing empire, he plans on processing Abe and all of his Mudokon pals into delicious meat snacks! Suddenly, Abe is spotted, and considers finding the fastest escape route out of Rupture Farms, but hesitates. He can't just save his own hide; there are 99 other Mudokons who need a savior too!\n\nAbe's Oddysee is a 2D platformer, and a tough one at that. It's similar to the original Prince of Persia with arched jumps, fiendish traps and a duck-n-roll gameplay style; the difference is that Abe has no attacks of his own, and is in fact, completely unarmed. Well, he has one special move, which allows him to posses the Slig guards, hideous slug-like creatures armed with machine guns. This means that Abe relies primarily on stealth, slinking silently in the shadows, occasionally possessing a guard or two in order to solve devilishly hard and ingenious puzzles. A great example of this can be found early in the game; in order for Abe to proceed, he must navigate a series of corridors guarded by patrolling Sligs. How do you deal with such a conundrum? Easy, hide out of the line of machine gun fire, posses a single Slig guard and mow down all the other guards before running the possessed puppet into a meat grinder. Puzzle solved and hilarity ensured. Of course, the puzzles get increasingly more complex, and trying to complete levels can be harder than first perceived, especially when security eventually steps in and prevents you from possessing Sligs.\n\nThe only way to master the game is through trial and error. As Abe, you must learn the area layouts and master the timing on encounters. Its reaction based, and you have to develop those lightning fast reflexes quickly because the puzzles have a ridiculously hard learning curve and complete control over Abe is utterly essential in tight situations. You are going to die, a lot, and having to rescue Mudokons on top of everything else just makes it harder to achieve the goal- you can't just run past guards and hope to get lucky - all your mates will become lead pumped corpses if you dare. Completing levels and trying to save Mudokons is a fine line to balance; should you take the morally minded side, then you're in for some expertly crafted and insanely hard mind melting dilemmas. Playing the reluctant hero is not only hard, but it also requires the constant communication between Abe and his chums through the use of Gamespeak, which allows Abe to relay instructions to his posse of frazzled Mudokons - from 'wait' to 'follow', the wearied followers will rely on instructions from him before moving a single muscle. Abe can also fart and whistle but these are less essential, yet still rather amusing, tools.\n\nNow all this is very well and good, but is the game a looker? Well, yes. Yes, it is. The world is incredibly well-realized and the character design is spot-on. The art is amazing and it sucks you in from the start with its portrayal of a gritty industrial hell-world, as well as its brooding temples and wastelands later on. All of the creatures have a worn, dirty look to them and yet even the vicious Scrab wildlife can be both endearing and terrifying. Oddworld is a horrible place to live, and creator Lorne and his development team aren't going to let you forget it. It's difficult to try and encapsulate what a fantastically dark world the developers have created in words, but to see such formidable, soul-chilling environments and creatures balanced by naïve and strangely lovable characters is truly a sight to behold. The art is complimented by sinister, atmospheric musical pieces that builds so much tension it's hard not to break a sweat; long, barren sound-scapes fill the background complete with whirring machinery or cooing wildlife and when the chase is on a fast paced, drum-heavy tribal music kicks in, causing your heart rate to speed up in accordance.\n\nBut it's not only the music and sound-scapes that make this an aural pleasure, the voice acting is so marvelous and well suited to the characters its hard not to fear for Abe's pals even after you've logged out of the game. Admittedly, some may think the graphics are a little dated, but if you can put up with a little bit of a blurry resolution, you'll find that the actual animation and backgrounds are created with such flair and originality they possess that most desired of all traits: timelessness. Nothing has made me drop my jaw in astonishment since I saw the graphics for Abe's Oddysee for that first time, and I doubt anything ever will.\n\nRecommendation: Old school platform puzzler for the gamer who wants to live and breathe a world rather than destroy it, but hellishly difficult and perhaps just a little bit too steep a learning curve for most.\n\nBottom Line: The tough but rewarding gameplay coupled with the most amazing story telling and beautiful environments make this a landmark in gaming history and one you should all go take note of. Go and get this game, by buying, begging or burglary, just find a way to play this wonderful piece of gaming.","November 29, 2013","true","4.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The resolution is 640x480 and can't be changed. The controls are fiddly, and while it seems to support a controller, it doesn't play nicely with my xbox one.\n\nThere's lots to like about the game, especially if you are old enough to remember its release. But alas, it just doesn't play well with more modern computers, and as there are too many options to really work with a controller, it is just a pain to play.\n\nIf you are running XP, you may have better luck.

As far as I remember, it was a popular release and it received many positive reviews by the major publications of the time. I was excited to buy it but as soon as I began playing it, I remember being disappointed. I can't remember whether or not I beat it back then but chances are high that I got bored and quit playing just as I did now.\n\nDespite what the multitude of nostalgic, rabid and headstrong fans say, Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee  didn't age well at all from what was already a mediocre effort to begin with. While the character design is interesting and charming, everything else is quite flawed. The background graphics and animations are average to below average, the music is nearly non-existent, the sound effects can get borderline annoying at times, and worst of all, the controls are extremely unresponsive, sluggish and awkward. Getting Abe to perform the most basic of platforming moves such as seamlessly running, stopping, climbing on a ledge and then sneaking is painful and inadequate. Controlling Abe feels very much delayed and as if the movements were restricted in some way. The puzzles and rooms are designed competently for the most part but when you have to deal with the game's awful controls, solving each screen is too aggravating and devoid of any fun whatsoever. The gameplay revolves around traversing the game world one screen at a time. Even though not every screen presents the player with a puzzle or a situation that needs his or her attention, there is still the need to advance through each screen individually and with a slight pause between each transition. Deaths come often and the player will be forced to repeatedly wait through a lengthy death and restart animation that takes about five seconds to complete. The save system is based on checkpoints, so if the player dies several screens beyond the last checkpoint, every screen from the checkpoint to the point of death will need to be redone as many times as it takes until you reach the next checkpoint. Without mentioning any spoilers, it is encouraged that there is at least one additional playthrough after you beat the game once. In relation to this, one of the worst design choices in the game presents itself. The goal is to rescue slaves. Unfortunately for the player, many of the slaves are hidden away in secret areas that are absolutely not easy to find. Thanks to this design decision, this means the player will fail at the goal the game has set to be accomplished.\n\nIt's surprising to me how much love Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee has garnered through the years. It has far too many flaws to be enjoyed and it's way too annoying to be played to completion. This game could easily have been so much better than it actually is.\n\nOddworld: Abe's Oddysee is mediocre.","May 10","false","5.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","1"

Death comes easy and fast but returning to where you died to try again can take a frustratingly long time.  A quick save would have fixed this, but no such option exists.\n\nDesigned to be harsh but completely at the expense of fun.  Each death can reset a considerable amount of progress - to the point of being unfair.\n\nThe later iterations have fixed this, but this 1997 version has little respect for your time.  I find it impossible to recommend because the genre (punishing game play that teaches through deaths) has been far more refined in modern games.\n\nClaims of this being 'hardcore' or for 'oldschool' players aren't made by those who value their time.\n\nA more in-depth fleshed out review here:\n\nhttp://theboilingpot.net/oddworld-abes-oddysee/","May 9","false","2.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Really, I do.  It's widely regarded as a classic, and it's clear enough why.  Oddworld is aptly named: it's unique, an oddity.  The characters are grotesque, the premise is delightfully morbid, and it's full of dark humor, constantly setting you up to accidentally kill the people you're trying to save (which isn't a game over, as it would be in almost any other game).  But after dying a couple dozen times in a row in the same spot early in the game because the finicky controls make success seemingly impossible, I must give up on it, and reluctantly give it the thumbs down.  Maybe the remake is improved?

If you are looking to broadcast, ♥♥♥♥ off cuz it won't work.(WITHOUT THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE REQ) Even if you do get third party software, it will make the game so unplayable it will just disgust you.\n\nGame Controllers:\nDo not work. (THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE REQ) Again, the third party software sort of works. Ie A button works but directionals do not. Not only that but you can not set your key bindings to your controller let alone your own keyboard. WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ DEVS!!!???\n\nWinCompat:\nSure it "works" on windows xp and newer versions but the direct x needs a super ♥♥♥♥ing upgrade to play nicely with windows 7 or 8. It is super ♥♥♥♥ing laggy. Like 8fps laggy. It literally skips frames through video. Game play is fine at moments.\n\nBroadcasting:\nForget about it. The simple fact that windowed mode is not a option nor something that can be edited via steam gamelaunch settings. Just give up. You cannot broadcast it because the normal steam hot keys Shift+Tab doesn't work. Also it is not a game that can be auto-detected. On top of that, most broadcasters use extended displays. Well this game ♥♥♥♥s that up too. Have windows open on your other display and game on main? Well guess what, now you only have your game on your main screen because for whatever ♥♥♥♥ed up reasons the game does not allow it.\n\nEnd Points:\nDo I like the game. I liked it on its' console counter part. This "works on pc" release is ♥♥♥♥. PURE ♥♥♥♥. I would recommend spending your money elsewhere until or unless the DEVS come out with a update to fix that crap. Which I doubt will ever happen because they just do not give any ♥♥♥♥♥. If they did they would sell this half completed pc compatible game to us via steam. Which brings me to my last point. STEAM please pull your co-workers head out of their ♥♥♥. We could use games that work the way the rest do. WINDOWED MODES, AND GAME SETUP ISSUES ON PURCHASE PAGES. DON"T WAIT FOR US TO FIND THIS CRAP.

But, since I do see what makes it so great, I'll write about it's good points as well as it's flaws.\n\nI remember seeing this game all around when it came out, which I must've been 8 or 10 at the time, but since we got the N64 over the Playstation, I never got a chance to play it until a couple of days ago. Oddworld is a really great and imaginitave world, with a really cool art style. While, the pre rendered graphics don't look as awesome or emersive as they did at the time it came out, they still look great, even for it's low resolution. And I can't wait to see how they look in the full 3D remake.\n\nThe controls feel really stiff for the first 10 or 15 minutes, but once you get use to it, it becomes a large part of the gameplay. It really gives you the sense of defenslesness a lot of these crummy "horror" games try to do these days, but makes it actually fun. You're no action hero, just a under malnurished slave to corperate giants. You can't leap real high and real far, so you got to be careful with trying to jump over a large gap, which makes it even more challenging when you're running from a monster. Speaking of which, being chased by some of these monsters makes me nearly crap myself.\n\nI really dig the world and the dirty and menacing look of the factories. It's not in-your-face about it's message about corperatism, but it's really imersive about how you're a slave to these big wigs, and they want to chop your people up and make them into food. Having worked in a McDonald's, I can really relate to this.\n\nOkay, so, let's talk about the reasons why I don't recommend this game. First of all, it doesn't work to great on modern PCs. There's a couple of files to download to make the game run better, but it'll end up crashing as soon as you quite and go back to the main menu, and the most annoying one being that the top part of the screen will freeze up, while the bottom half will keep playing.\n\nAnd, gameplay wise, while it is optional, when you're out in the wilderness, you can cut off from the path and jump into a portal that'll take you back to the factory to save more Modokens. Now, say you're on a area that's really challenging, so you go into a portal to save your friends. Then, you have another challenge of rescuing them, which could take you a couple of tries. Then, once you do, you go back to the previous area and continue your journy. But, you end up dieing, and now you have to go back, save the Modokens again, and then try that last part one more time. I have heard that this is going to be fixed in the remake, New 'n' Tasty, but for now it's really annoying, and for my spaztic little mind, I can't handle it.","May 4, 2014","false","6.1"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","3","14","0","2"

If you do not have them in your library, I would recommend you wait until New 'N Tasty is released, and buy that instead.

This, alongside Abe's Exoddus, is a must have for anyone looking for an exciting, fun, amusing and challenging game. The world is beautiful, the story is riveting and deep, even philosophical if you look deep enough, and the characters are engaging and easy to become attached to, and this runs right throughout the Oddworld series. I think this is second to only the sequel, Abe's Exoddus, only because of the implementation of the quick save feature and the 'All o' ya!' button in gamespeak. Although my steam play time may not show it, this is one of the games I've played the most of, and I've enjoyed every minute of it.

You have to be 100% perfect about your timing, character location and movement, otherwise you will be dead. The game has zero tolerance for player's mistakes. Big part of the game difficulty is added by that weird checkpoint system which made you to go through the same screens again and again and make the same actions again and again, until you're dead and have to go through all those damn screens one more time.\nIt's a shame it doesn't have a quicksave system, which would greatly improve player's experience and lower frustration. I see now why people usually recommend to play this game using the PS1 emulator which has the save system implemented.\nWhat's more to say? Just download the demo and try it for yourself. If you're patient and skillfull enough that game could be quite exciting.

I remember it being very difficult and scary at times but extremely fun. Sadly, the disc got scratched over time and I was left not being able to play it. until i found it on Steam a week ago. It is exactly as I remember, as fun and as challenging as ever. The graphics may look crap but when playing, the 3D and 2D look amazing. The sound effects work very well with the looks for the world and enemies are very different and feel alive. They each have their own traits which really bring them to life. The setting is amazing and original. Each part of the game is very memorable and each have their own soundtrack to go with it.  My only complaints are not being able to talk to all characters on screen at once and no quicksave, but these issues are addressed in Abe's Exoddus, the next game in the series. My other issue is some compatibility issues with Windows 8, but that is understandable due to the age of the game.\n\nOverall, 9/10. Just need to iron out a few bugs and that will make the game so much better.

If you have these games already I will give you a link to the .zip file that fixed my problem. If you do not have them in your library, I would recommend you wait until New 'N Tasty is released, and buy that instead.

I don't know if it's just me or if anyone else might have this problem occur.\n\nDespite its scale of difficulity, its sometimes tedious puzzles and the mentioned ILS problem, I truly love this game, for both nostalgia reasons - as I used to play this when I was young - and for the fact that I find it fun in general.\n\nWould I recommend this game?

You have to be 100% perfect about your timing, character location and movement, otherwise you will be dead. The game has zero tolerance for player's mistakes. Big part of the game difficulty is added by that weird checkpoint system which made you to go through the same screens again and again and make the same actions again and again, until you're dead and have to go through all those damn screens one more time.\nIt's a shame it doesn't have a quicksave system, which would greatly improve player's experience and lower frustration. I see now why people usually recommend to play this game using the PS1 emulator which has the save system implemented.\nWhat's more to say? Just download the demo and try it for yourself.

The world is beautiful, the story is riveting and deep, even philosophical if you look deep enough, and the characters are engaging and easy to become attached to, and this runs right throughout the Oddworld series.

One of the few video games to tackle serious real-world issues, Oddysee shines a darkly comedic yet sickly light on the cruelties of factory farming, as well as the exploitation of native cultures and wildlife by corporate greed. The game deals with the dichotomy of industrial and spiritual world views, and places us into a violent, weird and odd world. Just like our own.\n\nWhile these meanings and intentions are confirmed and stem from Oddworld's brainchild Lorne Lanning, all of this is likely lost on most of Oddworld's audience. It certainly was lost on me when I played it as a small child. However, Oddworld Inhabitants provided an exciting, intruiging and challenging experience in Oddysee whether or not the meanings were decoded. And later on, when the messages become more prevalent, it simply gives us more to talk about, and furthers the cause of games as effective, communicative art.\n\nOverall, Abe's Oddysee is a great game with a compelling setting and story. Exoddus is a brilliant follow-up, with more of the same. Both highly recommended and unexpectedly intelligent gems.","January 28","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is one of those games of my childhood, it comes with a major problem, sadly.\n\n1: Checkpoints. Often I will find a secret area, spend 1-15 minutes figuring out how to do it, leave the secret area, die to something and have that 1-15 minutes of progress lost and having to be repeated EACH time you make a mistake until the next checkpoint. You get better and can execute the puzzles faster, but the "secret area" puzzles are generally very difficult. There's one as early on as the first few screens of the game and damn is it frustrating to be forced to redo it each time you die to something entirely unrelated later on. This isn't the kind of game you can just pick up and not make any mistakes, and sticking to the main path the game handles it's saves very well, but you will die, you will come across trial and error moments, and you will lose some progress.\n\n2:Controls: Once you get familiar, or played this game for your entire childhood (oh and use good gamepad) the controls aren't AS big of an issue. They are still an issue, it's just not as awful. There's also very little in the way of explaining some of the more advanced things you can do. You can run into a jump, you can run into a roll, you can throw objects while crouching and in 4 directions, if you tap forward you will take one step no matter what. These aren't really problems for the guy who spent countless hours (no steam time counter on ps1 lol) on the game in his childhood but to new comers I can imagine the controls are a bit frustrating to learn on your own.\n\nThe game is great if you don't try to be a completionist and stay on the main storyline and is challenging without being frustrating, but when you start to try to solve the longer/more difficult secret areas later in the game, losing that 1-15 minutes of progress EACH time you have a death to something that would've been hard to predict, it's easy to lose motivation when there is a really out of date save system. I mean cheap deaths or "oh ♥♥♥♥, didn't see that coming" moments can be entertaining and I don't even think there's anything wrong with them, but replaying big portions of complex/difficult levels gets tedious for those of us who seek out the extra/secret areas and want to finish them.\n\nThat being said, I believe Abe's exodus introduced a quicksave and a ton of other great features. This game's story and world will captivate you, it's gameplay is great, but the checkpoint system and learning curve that come with a completionist mindset are harsh and likely not worth it without the massive nostalgia goggles I have on.","March 11","false","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember never finishing this many moons ago. Thought I would try again. I still very much enjoy the novelty of the game and the nice graphics.\n\nTrouble is, it's still very unforgiving and very frustrating in parts. Though those things are ok as that's just part of a good platformer. The thing I really don't like about the game is all the cheap deaths you incur. Some are there I'm sure, just so you can't do a level in one go. Pull a lever to bring down a lift and a slig pops up and creams you. Or you just go from one screen to the next and suddenly a slog  jumps in from behind you and kills you. Hard, fair games I enjoy and will battle on with. Games that make you do repeat screens because of cheap tricks turns me off.\n\nThankfully, Abe's Oddysee has much to like about it but it doesn't fully compensate for the cheap tricks. Then comes the ending. This is the cheapest trick of all. ++++ spoiler alert +++ but read it anyway if you want to keep your sanity! So you battle all through the game. 26hrs of it (for me at least). You get to the end, only to be fed into the grinding machine because you didn't happen to save enough Mudokons!!! Up pops a smarta@@ sign saying blah, blah do it again you need to save at least 50 Mudokons. With that, I quit the game and will never go back to it. Just another example of a good game ruined. Why not give us that detail to begin with? Would simply have added another dimension to the game. But no, the old cheap tricks prevail.\n\nI have marked this as recommended, but it is with reservation that I do. I just wish I knew about the 50 limit when I started. Either that, or I wish I had blown up and splatted every Mudokon I saw. The worst part, was that I did actually try to save every Mudokon I came across and didn't give any a cheap death. Maybe I should play it again just so I can see Mudokon bits flying everwhere bwahahahaha.","May 17, 2015","true","36.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Hard and punishing. I love this game for its charm and art but jesus christ if this doesn't give you an aneurysm in the first half an hour by golly you sir/mam are made of what diamons are made of. This is one of the tightest platform games ever created. There are rules for the controls and don't think you can glitch your way into the next area by running up a wall. No sir e bob this platform game is on a grid and as much as I want to complain about how easy it is to muck up a jump because I wasn't on the right tile or I held the arrow key down for too long it was always my fault. I needed to be better not the game. This game is very intimidating, it doesn't beat around the bush when it says 23 Mudokins are gonna die if you didn't save them 23 Mudokins die. This is the type of game that demands multiple play throughs and or complete mastery of the controls within the first one minute. By the time you would normally complete the tutorial you have passed 10% of the games secrets. The first secret uses advanced skills gained from the last section of the tutorial and the first Mudokin can't be saved unless you just know how to posess people.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ssshami/recommended/15700/","ssshami","Shami","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ssshami/","297 products in account","Abe's Oddysee is a masterpiece of a game. From the simple but challenging puzzle based gameplay, to the heady artstyle, to the rich world, to the deep and compelling storyline. Everything about this game fits together perfectly in a way that stands the test of time in a way few games from that era do.\n\n\nThe premise is simple, you play as Abe, A Mudoken slave worker working for the meat processing facility, Rupture Farms. After farming other species to near extinction in service of profit, The tyrannical Glukkon overlords decide to turn their slave workers into their next New 'n Tasty delight. After learning this, Abe decides to escape and try and save some of his fellow workers along the way. The dark thematic elements of the story juxtaposed with the cutesey artstyle and adorable haiku's narrated by Abe goes hand in hand and works on so many levels. The game gives you a glimpse of this diverse, incongruous world and makes you want to know more about what lays beyond.\n\n\nThe gameplay involves you traversing through 2-D environments, avoiding traps and enemies while also leading your fellow mudoken's to safety. Everything you see in the game is tile based. You press forward once, you move forward one tile. When you jump, you jump three tiles ahead and more when you get a running start. It's all very simple. Where the beauty lays is in the specificity required to complete the increasingly complex puzzles. In the later stages you'll be required to complete screen after screen after screen of challenging platforming levels without resbite where the slightest mistake will send you right to the begining with nobody to blame but yourself. The controls are so tight that when you do eventually overcome an obstacle, the feeling of satisfaction is immense. It's something that's kept me coming back to this game for over a decade.\n\n\nWhile the remake doesn't quite capture the nuance of the platforming the way I'd like, It manages to recapture a lot of the narrative hooks that, well, hooked me and is absolutley worth a shot but nothing can compare to the purity of the original.","January 9","true","40.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But boy did this game give me nightmares. I used to have dreams of abe in a castle (Rupture Farms) chasing me with a knife. And I was always so scared but yet intrigued. So as the years went on I got more and more interested until finding out more info and since my parents wouldnt let me get Oddysee or Exoddus I would have to do with Munch's Oddysee which I hated until evantually on my birthday last day of the steam summer sale I purchased Oddysee Exoddus and my fav game of all time Stranger's Wrath\n\nBut this game\nThe story is unique and brilliant giving the player a crappy skinny blue guy with no muscles or guns. But what does it give you SOME FREAKING BRILLIANT PUZZLES THAT TRUELY TEST ONE'S MIND\n\nThe gameplay is fluent fun and enjoyable with some of the smaller details like moving barrels in the background adding to the brilliant experience. Also I'm unable to stress enough the feeling and atmosphere of this game. The feeling of booting up the game seeing abe seeing his dire situation and then watching his fellow mudokuns scrub the floors makes the game's atmosphere feel heavy and a bit depressing but thats made up for by some of the comedy like farting which makes the situation a bit more comedic and fun. But you aren't ever safe and that's what I love about this game the feeling of running for your dear life.The second you begin your running always running and saving your race cause your their last hope. And it makes the ending all the more rewarding and badass when you do beat the game. And well done you beat it. But with yourself always running and never slowing it made me laugh when once I had overcomed the challenge that was Oddworld Abe's Oddysee. The game developer Oddworld Inhabitants challenged me to get all 99. And after all the fun I've had with this game and with the : Gameplay,Atmosphere,Story,Cutscenes,Characters,Universe,Jokes,Controls all being superb I accept your challenge Oddworld Inhabitants and maybe after that I'll get all 300 in Exoddus\nBRING IT ON","September 23, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember never finishing this many moons ago. Thought I would try again. I still very much enjoy the novelty of the game and the nice graphics.\n\nTrouble is, it's still very unforgiving and very frustrating in parts. Though those things are ok as that's just part of a good platformer. The thing I really don't like about the game is all the cheap deaths you incur. Some are there I'm sure, just so you can't do a level in one go. Pull a lever to bring down a lift and a slig pops up and creams you. Or you just go from one screen to the next and suddenly a slog  jumps in from behind you and kills you. Hard, fair games I enjoy and will battle on with. Games that make you do repeat screens because of cheap tricks turns me off.\n\nThankfully, Abe's Oddysee has much to like about it but it doesn't fully compensate for the cheap tricks. Then comes the ending. This is the cheapest trick of all. ++++ spoiler alert +++ but read it anyway if you want to keep your sanity! So you battle all through the game. 26hrs of it (for me at least). You get to the end, only to be fed into the grinding machine because you didn't happen to save enough Mudokons!!! Up pops a smarta@@ sign saying blah, blah do it again you need to save at least 50 Mudokons. With that, I quit the game and will never go back to it. Just another example of a good game ruined. Why not give us that detail to begin with? Would simply have added another dimension to the game. But no, the old cheap tricks prevail.\n\nI have marked this as recommended, but it is with reservation that I do. I just wish I knew about the 50 limit when I started. Either that, or I wish I had blown up and splatted every Mudokon I saw. The worst part, was that I did actually try to save every Mudokon I came across and didn't give any a cheap death. Maybe I should play it again just so I can see Mudokon bits flying everwhere bwahahahaha.","May 17, 2015","true","36.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

This is one of those games of my childhood, it comes with a major problem, sadly.\n\n1: Checkpoints. Often I will find a secret area, spend 1-15 minutes figuring out how to do it, leave the secret area, die to something and have that 1-15 minutes of progress lost and having to be repeated EACH time you make a mistake until the next checkpoint. You get better and can execute the puzzles faster, but the "secret area" puzzles are generally very difficult. There's one as early on as the first few screens of the game and damn is it frustrating to be forced to redo it each time you die to something entirely unrelated later on. This isn't the kind of game you can just pick up and not make any mistakes, and sticking to the main path the game handles it's saves very well, but you will die, you will come across trial and error moments, and you will lose some progress.\n\n2:Controls: Once you get familiar, or played this game for your entire childhood (oh and use good gamepad) the controls aren't AS big of an issue. They are still an issue, it's just not as awful. There's also very little in the way of explaining some of the more advanced things you can do. You can run into a jump, you can run into a roll, you can throw objects while crouching and in 4 directions, if you tap forward you will take one step no matter what. These aren't really problems for the guy who spent countless hours (no steam time counter on ps1 lol) on the game in his childhood but to new comers I can imagine the controls are a bit frustrating to learn on your own.\n\nThe game is great if you don't try to be a completionist and stay on the main storyline and is challenging without being frustrating, but when you start to try to solve the longer/more difficult secret areas later in the game, losing that 1-15 minutes of progress EACH time you have a death to something that would've been hard to predict, it's easy to lose motivation when there is a really out of date save system. I mean cheap deaths or "oh ♥♥♥♥, didn't see that coming" moments can be entertaining and I don't even think there's anything wrong with them, but replaying big portions of complex/difficult levels gets tedious for those of us who seek out the extra/secret areas and want to finish them.\n\nThat being said, I believe Abe's exodus introduced a quicksave and a ton of other great features. This game's story and world will captivate you, it's gameplay is great, but the checkpoint system and learning curve that come with a completionist mindset are harsh and likely not worth it without the massive nostalgia goggles I have on.","March 11","false","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chezzyknytt/recommended/15700/","Chezzyknytt","Chezzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chezzyknytt/","94 products in account","Abe's Oddysee is a masterpiece of satire, dark humour and social commentary. One of the few video games to tackle serious real-world issues, Oddysee shines a darkly comedic yet sickly light on the cruelties of factory farming, as well as the exploitation of native cultures and wildlife by corporate greed. The game deals with the dichotomy of industrial and spiritual world views, and places us into a violent, weird and odd world. Just like our own.\n\nWhile these meanings and intentions are confirmed and stem from Oddworld's brainchild Lorne Lanning, all of this is likely lost on most of Oddworld's audience. It certainly was lost on me when I played it as a small child. However, Oddworld Inhabitants provided an exciting, intruiging and challenging experience in Oddysee whether or not the meanings were decoded. And later on, when the messages become more prevalent, it simply gives us more to talk about, and furthers the cause of games as effective, communicative art.\n\nOverall, Abe's Oddysee is a great game with a compelling setting and story. Exoddus is a brilliant follow-up, with more of the same. Both highly recommended and unexpectedly intelligent gems.","January 28","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not just the gameplay thats amazing, but the art. Infact, the whole game is a work of art. Ecpecily Parimonia and Scrabainia. The  soundtrack paird with the visuals works beautifly. 10/10","January 16","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And is definitly worth buying if you want an intense and fustrating time. 8/10 because of the port (10/10)","April 13","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Best I can say is if you have Windows 10 don't purchase, but if not, going by other reviews, I can only assume it's as amazing as the original.","May 25","false","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Generally, it is a game that requires careful planning and good control.A great game that I'll recommend. However, the bad thing is that when you save, you actually save by region rather than progress, and furthermore, there is no clear indication of where is the checkpoint. Which means if you played halfway through a particular region and rescued, for example, half of the mudokuns in that region and then did a manual save, then made a wrong move and decided to reload that saved game, you'll end up restarting the region instead of continuing from the part where you already saved half the number of mudokuns.","May 30","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
