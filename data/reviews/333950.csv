I've never personally experience a better voxel system for quick and intuitive building. The game makes creation extremely easy and with the dynamic destruction and physics of it's engine it makes even mistakes or intentional destruction beautiful. On that note this game is very process intensive, demolishing huge castles will lagg even the best of PC's and in it's current build I have crashed quite often. That being said the act of building is spot on and in my honest opinion a very solid base for pretty much ensuring this will be a successful Early Access title. The game needs more content, that's a given, you are limited to what you can build because of lacking tools especially in the spring and rope territory. But with it's unique voxel construction system you can build blocks inside of blocks so if you're creative you can make some absolutely wild stuff in this early build. Be careful though the game does have a very decent structure system and if you don't build your castles with weight in mind they definitely can come tumbling down.\n\nOverall in it's current build I give it 7/10 but with updates to the game engine (latency), added materials, multiplayer enabled and survival mode implemented I can seriously see this game being in the high 9s.\n\nI don't want to be intrusive with videos but I am makign a series breifly overviewing a lot of the games core mechanics you can watch any at your viewing pleasure.\n\nBuilding Basics\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Q5GlYA8oU&list=PLEngsjAeWQXinqF-wZBR8gFmRjwYamjpx\n\nDestruction\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYrGxt1rlOA&index=2&list=PLEngsjAeWQXinqF-wZBR8gFmRjwYamjpx\n\nSiege Equipment\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhnoJWrHkuI&list=PLEngsjAeWQXinqF-wZBR8gFmRjwYamjpx&index=3","February 19, 2015","true","8.2"," 137 of 163 people (84%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","84","137","163","12","1"

I cannot really mention survival mode as being positive or negative. I honestly did not see the point of adding the mode this early into development.\nI love building castles in any game. Medieval Engineers takes the cake. I have made large and small castles, both with little hidden tunnels and rooms. The possibilities are endless. The building mechanics can be a little difficult if you have never played Space Engineers. The system is almost the same as the system in Space Engineers. Building physics, oh my building physics. The first time a bridge collapsed, I didn't through a fit, I went nuts. The amount of destruction was... Glorious. I also like that there is an option to turn on to see the stresses on buildings. This definitely helps rather than flying blind. While I have not used multiplayer very often, I did play a few hours with some friends. Unfortunately, at the time, Castle Siege was not in the game. What we did do was using other gamemodes from other games. Things like; hide and go seek and TTT. This in itself was awesome. Wandering through castles wondering if someone was hiding in a hidden room was fantastic. The soundtrack blew me away when I first got the game. Then I felt like the same 4 songs were repeating over and over. So, for now, I have the music turned off.\nSadly, here comes the bubble popper. I cannot express my despair at this. This game desperately needs optimization. Sure, sure keep adding little weekly updates of doo dads but please, please, please give the users some damn optimization. I have a decent gaming rig and Medieval Engineers (borrowing the expression from my grandparents) "runs like goose poop through a tin horn." I am currently running on the lowest graphical settings and I can barely go over 30 fps. The game appears to become slower with every "oooh a piece of candy update. Also, if some optimization does eventually happen, please DO NOT give Nvidia users special treatment. I feel like so many developers just optimize for Nvidia and call it finished. I suppose that is a rant for another day. Then there is a fog. If you watch videos from the developers and users alike, you will notice that there is this strange fuzziness and fog. I am not sure what to call it, but I hate it. I prefer games with crystal clarity, not "I smeared mayonnaise in my eyes, some one help me." I also despise the sounds the developers used for fires. The sound would be okay if it wasn't so loud. I cannot walk through my castles without it sounding like someone started roasting weenies on a bon fire. If I could just remove that single sound from the game I would be incredibly happy.\nAll of this said, I will still put more hours into the game. Perhaps a few hours here and there before the lag gives me a headache. If you can get the game for $10 USD or less (including the soundtrack) go for it.\n\n\nThe good:\nCastles, castles, and more castles\nAmazing building mechanics\nBuilding physics\nMultiplayer\nWeekly updates\nFantastic soundtrack\n\nThe bad:\nAbsolute lagfest unless you have a beastly $2,000+ gaming computer\nFuzziness/fog\nLag\n\nTL;DR: Oh my building physics. Lag rant. If you can get the game for $10 USD or less (including the soundtrack) go for it.\n\nUpdated: 1/17/2016\n\nI recently updated a long list of drivers. My frames have only gone up a small amount. Roughly 5-10 FPS.\n\nUpdate: 4/5/2016\n\nAfter a recent update for the game, I am running even slower. Unless I am building a  shack on the smalled terrain, I am getting 20 fps max. No new updates for drivers found. Thanks guys. Progress, updating games to make them slower!

I wanted a game like this from my childhood on, and finally it has arrived. It does a disservice to the creators of the game to try and morph it into a "child" or "combination" of already created and known games.

Game mechanics are broken, physics on self made war machines are bugged and sometimes your creation will just explode, even if you have no spring or something attached to it. Also controls are weird. So if you expect this to work as good as - lets say Besiege - you should wait a few more months. And then you should remember that Medieval Engineers is or will be more realistic than Besiege.\n\nBUT Keen House Software, well known because of it's first 'Engineering'-game Space Engineers are updating really frequent with content updates and bugfixes.

Here's my experience so far:\n\nI awoke in a rather picturesque field of grass and flowers next to a cart. I pushed the cart and it moved easily, which seemed like good news, but I'd save that for later. I immediately headed for a forest I saw in the distance as that looked like a good place to start my search for useful resources. Arriving at the edge of the forest I immediately grabbed the axe I had conveniently been provided and chopped down a tree. The tree fell on me and I died.\n\nI awoke again next to my trusty cart and headed in a different direction. This time I wandered until I came across an abandoned house. It wasn't the most interesting thing I'd ever seen, so I wandered back toward the forest. Noticing my growing hunger, I looked around for food and saw an unsuspecting deer. I tried to get the deer. The deer ran away. I searched some more and found some mushrooms. At this point I was quite hungry so it seemed worth the risk. I ate the mushrooms which turned out to be nothing more than edible mushrooms.\n\nI wandered back to the tree I had chopped down and tried to pick it up. Apparently a 175kg log wouldn't fit in my backpack, so I chopped it into smaller pieces and carried them back to a relatively level area in the field to start building some shelter.\n\n\nThe game is absolutely not done, and a cursory glance at the forums will show you a definite weak spot in project management, resulting in a somewhat unstructured and chaotic release cycle. To their credit, they specifically list Project Manager as an open position, so I think they're aware.\n\nThe bottom line is this game is fun in its current state, and promises much more. If you like survival, building, medieval times and being crushed by falling trees, this game is absolutely for you.\n\n10/10 would be crushed again.","February 10","true","5.8"," 54 of 67 people (81%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","81","54","67","33","0"

The breakable ropes snap at contact with another block, a barbarian or the player. This is excellent news and gives a lot of possibilites! A great creative physics playground just got even better.\n\nThe ability to remove broken blocks automatically is also added and makes repairing a castle much easier. No more walking into broken blocks to push them out of the way in order to place a new block. Thank you Keen Software House!! Saves so much time when your ridiculously high "princess tower" collapses for the third time!\n\nAlso added was the ability to switch between day and night in creative mode, so you can see your pretty castle with torches and other light sources in the dark. Very pretty! My dream castle became even more wonderful in the dark :-)\n\nThey also made a rudimentary survival mode that makes you die if you fall down too high or get stuff in your head (like blocks, barbarians clubs or artillery projectiles).\n\nSo far, they are keeping their "patch every tuesday" promise. 11/10\n---\nOriginal review below\n---\n\nThis game is going to be brilliant. Already it is incredibly fun, despite it being a very early and unfinished game. There are quite a few bugs (to be expected from early access), so if dealing with that is something you absolutely loathe I recommend waiting a bit before trying it. Knowing the developer after playing a lot of Space Engineers, they make patches and improvements all the time. Normally I am skeptical to all early access games, because you always fear it will turn into vapor ware and be abandoned, but I had no such reservations about this one.\n\nSince release there have already been several patches and hotfixes, including one today that gave us more blocks to play with, including more catch blocks (essentially hinges), round timber logs, as well as "barbarian" bots that basically run around the map looking for king statues to destroy. This is excellent news for those of us who enjoy making horrible medieval traps of all kinds (dev has a hilarious video showing this). The bots can be turned on or off depending on what you want to do, so they don't mess up your perfect dream castle if you don't want to.\n\nEven with all the current limitations and bugs, the game is already amazingly fun to play. Keep in mind though that it does require a bit powerful pc to run properly. Especially destruction of blocks can slow down the computer.\n\nFinally, a tip: If ropes, rope drums, hinges or physics in general start acting strange, try saving and going out to main menu and reloading the game. It sorts out most problems.","February 24, 2015","true","78.5"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","34","40","4","3"

If you want to understand that last part, watch someones video on YouTube.\nHowever, whilst I do recommend this game it is only in the hope that the developers will improve on this. The game is perhaps the most unoptimised I have ever played, with lag occuring almost every time you destroy something. The game also lacks a large number of objects to build with. It would be even better if it had a Besiege swing to it, with AI that actually moves, interacts etc.\nMy PC isn't the best, I will be using an i5 as of tomorrow, which may combat the problems with FPS drops during destruction, but what really is disappointing is I can no longer play the game. My graphics card does qualify above the recommended requirements, but now whenever I try to play the game I am given an error. After trying the troubleshoots people have come up with it still doesn't work, and I hope that the developers will get back to me with a solution. I do believe it is because my graphics card uses Nvidia's Kepler microarchitecture, which struggles to use DX11.1.\n\nSo, 7/10 in the hope that the developers grow this game, optimise it, and solve the issues people are having with DX11.1.#\n\nEdit: 2 hours later, it's been fixed, I can now play.

Medieval Engineers has lots of features planned for it, so stay tuned.\n\nThe only downside that I can think of is that it craves a powerful computer to play it without problems.\n","October 29, 2015","true","50.2"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","23","29","0","1"

Myself included.  That said, there might be a few people out there with questions.  Hopefully this will answer them.\n\nMedieval Engineers is an absolutely beautiful game.  Everything from the folliage to the map-edge backdrop is very well done.  The music is perfect, and brings you a true sense of that medieval feeling.  In addition the physics engine is the best I've seen in a building game.  This game is well worth the money.  That said, there are a few drawbacks to the current version of the game so I'm going to let you know what you'll be getting into.  Note:  This list ONLY applies to the EARLY ACCESS LAUNCH.  I have no doubt things will be updated in the coming days and months.  So here we go;\n\n- No Survival Mode.\n- No Multiplayer.\n- Map size is limited, although "Normal" is a pretty decent size.\n- Very limited selection of parts.\n- Building collapses can cause heavy lag.\n- Heavy load times on map entry.\n- Limited rotation of some parts.\n- During building it feels too much like "Space Engineers", lacking it's own identity.\n\nSo, do I recommend this game?  HELL YES!  That said, if you're on the fence about purchasing it I'd watch the updates for now.  Wait until more parts are added and survival mode + multiplayer is included.  That way you won't be disapointed with your purchase.\n\nOtherwise, if you can deal with the limited state of the current game and trust solely in the knowledge that it will be improved, BUY IT NOW!","February 19, 2015","true","2.3"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","20","26","0","0"

There's a bug here and there, but this game is far above the average playability level of an early acces game. Pick it up for the low price it's at now or even with 25% discount if you own Space Engineers already (till march 4/5?).\n\nEdit: After doing some research, I am dissapointed about one najor thing. The 'Engineer' part of the game. A lot of stuff from the trailers and even the background clip in the main menu is NOT in the game.

There are a lot of them that promise much and deliver very few, taking too long to finish or even being released without getting finished at all. But THAT'S NOT THE CASE with Medieval Engeneers.\n\nThere has been only a few months since this game has been released in Alpha and it is ABSOLUTELY ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME already!!\nKeen Software House (the Producers) also produce Space Engeneers and both games are very well built. They are constantly being updated, mostly in a weekly basis (with bug fixes in a daily basis), and problems are very rare.\n\nHere goes a short synopse of what you get from this, yet brute but already quite refined, Diamond:\n\n- You get to build amazing Medieval Structures of Stone, Wood and Iron from scratch.\n- You can terraform the land, raise mountains, dig deep mines and build whatever you like upon it.\n- Construction is made through a very cleaver system of Stackable Blocks, which sometimes can be overlaid in order to create even more awesome composite blocks.\n- Blocks are affected by real Phisics. Weight, Height and Impact affect the blocks and they even crumble when overloaded.\n- EVERYTHING IS DESTRUCTABLE! You can build large fortresses just to have a lot of fun destroying it later on. And destroying it isn't only realistic as hell, but it's also very very fun!!\n- You can already build a wide variety of buildings (from tiny poor villager houses to might Castles and Citadels), and every week more and more blocks are released into the game.\n- The game also provides easy access to even more blocks from Steam Workshop's independant developers.\n- You can build not only fixed buildings, but also complex mechanisms like Lifts, Porticulis, Draw Bridges, Catapults, Onagers, Trebuchets, Balistas, Windmills, etc. AND THEY ACTUALLY WORK!!!\n\nThis game is Heaven for your Creativity and only the sky is the Limit.\nI recommend this game, I recommend the producers and I also recommend buyinf it even on Early Access. If you liked to play with Legos when you were younger, you are sure to love it as much as I do.","May 8, 2015","true","183.8"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","18","25","3","0"

This time however not in space but sort of safely on the ground.\n\nThose who are familiar with Space Engineers will certainly enjoy this game, the controls feel very much the same and the building mechanics ave a lot in common. However, there are some very vital differences, I'll list them later on.\n\nThose who are new to the "Engeneering" saga of KSH may need to put in a little more effort to get the hang of the controls and building mechanics but with a bit of perserverence everyone get's the of this game.\n\nThe game is still in pre alpha, this means that everything is subjected to change, and crashes are not always inevitable. The game runs smoothly tough and feels like a proper early acces title. KSH is known for updating Space Engineers weekly, the same will probably happen to Med. Engineers.\n\nThe major building mechanic differences:\n\n1) You can choose to build objects "off the grid" wich means they are not snapping to the ground or other objects, this means you can build objects that are moveable by e.g. walking in to them or making moving contraptions.\n\n2) You can now build multiple pieces of wall and a like in 1 bulding square. Buildings get more compact that way, something that is still not available in Space Engineers.\n\n3) Large and small blocks can easily be build on or to eachother without uses of converters and the sorts.\n\n4) Properly breaking objects, walls and the like.\n\n5) Optional (but recommended) building integrety wich means you got to really plan your builds to make sure they don't break under they own weight.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nIt's a great and promissing pre alpha game that will certainly warm your heart if you like building, planning, medieval styles and a great dev team that updates their games reguarly and listens to feedback.\n\nNow buy it already and get constructing!","February 19, 2015","true","7.3"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","12","14","2","0"

It will be more than worth the price of admission then.\n\nAlso, just in case you didn't read the store page, don't go into this game expecting it to be medieval Minecraft. With the structural integrity system this game has, you can't build the sort of fantastical structures you could in Minecraft. Hell, you probably won't even be able to build a small house properly on your first try. Yes, you can disable it, but why would you do that?","February 21, 2015","true","1.9"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

I understand it is in "Early Alpha" therefore it still has its issues.  I have Space Engineers also and seeing how well that game has grown an advanced I would only expect this game to do also.  The level of game detail is great, the depth you have when building and creating machines is amazing.\nIf you enjoy Space Engineers / Minecraft style creative games then this is for you.  I think this game is just going to get bigger and better and may I dare to say might rival Minecraft if they push it in that direction.  Anyone sitting on the fence about this game should jump off and get it quick.\nThere are current system requirements to play the game that are quite high so please be sure to check it will run on your machine before you buy.  Also this is a "Early Alpha" game so be aware it has very minimal content other the creative mode but what is there is a lot to work with already.\n\nSo in closing I highly recommend this game, but do your homework about it before you make your final decision.","March 7, 2015","true","72.7"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","76","13","17","7","0"

I won't lie, I got super excited about it. In fact I got so excited I binge played Banished and Stronghold. I didn't want to get it yet because it was pre-alpha (very few pre-alpha games are good. Empyrion Galactic Survival is a good game and is in pre-alpha) and it would be too buggy.\n\nIn case you don't know about the game, ME is you and some friends in a giant pit surrounded by mountains with a forest smack dab in the center (at least on our map) and you have to bum rush for items like food and such. You build a castle and combat your others of the game and can build an army of peasent's to do your bidding. We never got far enough to see WHAT the peasents would do, however, as the game is now only in alpha and the many bugs left in the physics engine would kill the peasents. I want to say now: these guys are building from the ground up. They might be using unity or something, but I am still in awe at how complex this game actually is in it's early stages.\n\nOn to what I don't like here. As I said there are many physics bugs, however not so severe that if you get stuck in a crick in a hole you get shot into the atmosphere (this happens in 7 Days To Die, another good pre-alpha game). No, instead if you have your peasents doing generic things, like gather wood and stone, and have them flop it into a pile somewhere things have a tendency to slide wherever they want. EVERYthing on the map is a hill. You cannot go anywhere in the basin and not be climbing or going down something, Whether that is a bug in map generation or something, no clue. Because the items move around the AI trips over everything, including their own feet (which is really freaking funny to see). Bjorg and Helga can be hauling wood and stone while Ingvarad is organising wood, but then Bjorg hits Invar with a stick, nothing is actually no-collided in the engine, and then Bjorg, Invar, Helga, You, Half your castle, AND probably some trees are up in the atmosphere. Then some raiders run by and steal your ♥♥♥♥; did I mention that? Fun fact the raiders are no-collided but nothing else is. You can walk through them. WTF.\n\nNext to that there is no tutorial. The game has been out a year and all you get is an obnoxious block of text that never goes away that says "HIT F1 TO SEE SOME ♥♥♥♥" and then you have SEVEN PAGES OF KEYSTROKES to go through to learn how to build a wall. A freaking wall. Yeah you start out with some walls, but you have to figure this ♥♥♥♥ out like they did way back in 903. Now that I think about it that it kind of ingenius.....\n\nThis would be fixed if looking at stuff would say "Hit T to Pick Up" or "Hit C To Open Crafting Menu!" In fact, if they would fix the damn inventory system that would be cool. I like it; it actually reminds me of games like High Seas Trader (dos game from 1992/5) but jesus ♥♥♥♥ man, you could do better..... Look up an image of it and try to figure it out, because I am lost A F. Actually NVM I can't even find an image bigger than 100X64...... It's bad, lets just say that. On one half you have a drop down to select a source, on the other half you have your pockets, nearby wagons, wagon's you aren't even close to, other players / NPC peasants, the ground, an ALL page (???) and a cargo page. I have no clue what all or cargo are, but it didn't bring me anything. Also the menu's will decide to disappear and reappear at random. I know what you're thinking. "Yeah you walked away from a chest or something right?" No, that chest is still in the inventory available space and I am on the other side of the map, but my pockets are not there........ This is an easy fix so no big prob there, but the inventory system needs to be thrown out and redone, even with legos, I don't care how.\n\nEarlier I said the game was complex A F. This is no joke. You have to build your siege weapons by hand. You get to design how they balance, pull, push, counter balance, all of it. With the bugs in the physics engine you couldn't have a rotary balista without it helicoptering to space, but you could do it nonetheless. I never figured out crafting but I imagine that it is just as wierd. Even picking up basic resources is a pain in the ♥♥♥. Cut down a tree! And again! And Again! AGAIN! Try picking it up! Leave inv and try again! No? Well walk out of the map chunk and back and try again. There ya go!\n\nAll in all this is an awesome game and anyone who picks it up will not be disappointed. If you're like me you jump in and immediately you think of a first person version of Banished. While it definately needs to have a lot of bugs exterminated and annihilated, pick it up, fund the devs, have a go with some friends, and I garuntee you that you will be laughing your ♥♥♥ off at some point.\n","November 21, 2015","true","1.3"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","66","21","32","5","0"

However, I cannot recommend this title in its present state. This one has been out for some time, and it is still very poorly allocated. The memory allocation makes the game almost impossible to run. I have a GTX970 video card, and a 4690 Intel processor, as well as 8G of ram. The game is not running worth a darn on it. It continually freezes up (usually after every single block placement while building), and then crashes to desktop, saying that there is sufficient memory for all the tasks running. The only things running is the Steam ap and the game. When the problem is posted on the discussion page, the devs do not respond. The only response I have seen is the statement that the individual's computer is not powerful enough to play the game. And this for a fairly high-end rig.\n\nThe construction inventory, to be fair, is fairly extensive. However, it lacks some fairly vital and basic items. For instance, you can place statues around the castle courtyard, but there are no doors of any kind. No drawbridges, nothing. So either you cannot leave the keep, or the enemies can just walk in. I can see this oversight for a short while, but for any length of time it is pretty game breaking.\n\nAs a multiplayer game it has some serious potential down the road, provided the devs actually (eventually) respond to, and address the issues in-game. But that time has not yet arrived. And as long as they ignore these legitimate concerns from their customers, the game is still fairly unplayable. As a single-player game, which the store page insists that it is, there is nothing to do but to build the architecture. No serious NPC's exist or are slated to ever exist as far as I can tell. That is not all bad. As a castle-building simulator, it could be fun for some people, and I would eventually be willing to recommend it at that time, provided the problems are addressed.","January 7","false","14.1"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","19","31","2","0"

And oh, how early access it truly is.\n\nIn its current form (I write this in April 2015, just after the addition of deer AI), I would not reccomend getting this game. At all. There are just so many bugs, lag issues and imperfections. I have faith they will be fixed as the game development progresses, but right now, it's horrific.\n\nAnd one thing stands out above all else.\n\nThe game lags, all the time. Every time anything is hit by a projectile, or otherwise damaged by other means, the game freezes. And I don't want to hear any crap from people saying it's about system requirements; I have every single aspect of the reccomended PC specifications fulfilled, and it still behaves this way. You would have to hack into the Pentagon and use their supercomputers to run this game for it to be smooth, and even then it'd probably freeze every now and then.\n\nOh, and the loading times. Good lord. It can take up to 3 minutes to load a level. Again, i'm sure this will be abbreviated by various adjustments to the physics engine and whatnot, but good god. Lord have mercy on the person who tries to open the replica of AC2's Monteriggioni someone made.\n\nI feel this game has tremendous potential, and will mature into a good, entertaining experience given time, but in its current form, I do not reccomend you pay £15 to play the lagfest that is April 2015's Medieval Engineers.","April 10, 2015","false","8.2"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","1"

This game has a whole new level of interesting and unique features, and both Space Engineers and Medieval Engineers are going to feed each other ideas. For example, ME had  "Voxel hands" first, then SE got them. So, back to this game and ONLY this game. This game has smooth gameplay, solid building, few bugs that I can see, and is very beautiful graphics wise. Two of the main features you come across very early in gameplay are the destruction physics and compound building.\n\n1. Destruction physics: The detsruction of buildings reminds me a lot of "Red Faction: Guerilla" and it's GeoMod engine. When a catapult projectile is dropped on a building, it will crack and shoot dust up. When a catapult projectile is charged up and launched, it does major damage. When a full building block (or a whole building itself) is dropped on a building, it is just turned to rubble. The destruction is solid and satisfying to cause.\n\n2. Compound building: This is a feature I hope gets implimented into SE. I am positive it will. Here's what it does: Let's say the whole in-game building system is on a grid of 1x1x1 cubes (let's call it a unit). So 1 block of stone is a whole unit, 1 stairs block is 1 unit and so on. Well, If you have walls that are placed to the edge of the unit, then you could not place 2 walls to make a corner in a 1 block unit. With compund building, you can. So you can do it with almost any block.\n\nNow, PROS and CONS:\n\nPros:\n\n1. Gameplay: Solid, smooth and fun. Pretty straight forward. 10/10\n\n2. Graphics: The worlds are beautiful and very scenic. Even the buildings themselves and the medieval textures are very realistic and quite spot on. There is 1 bug where placing multiple blocks in 1 slot makes textures glitch in the spot that the material overlaps. But not too big of a deal. 9.8/10\n\n3. Building: The building is solid and fun. Easy to do, but takes some getting used to. 9.8/10\n\n4. Controls: There are alot of controls to learn and shortcuts to master, but it is not too hard to get a grip on. 9.5/10\n\n5. Complexity/simplicity balance: One thing I look at in any building/crafting game is how simple it can be for simple people, while also being ABLE to be very complex for very creative people if they so choose. This game does it. You can simply build houses, or use medieval machinery to build crazy contraptions quickly and actually quite easliy, and of course there will updates and optimizations. 10/10\n\nCons\n\n1. *YOU CAN IGNORE THIS ONE FOR NOW; VERY EARLY ACCESS GAME* Not very much content, so if that is what you are looking for, you should wait a few weeks, months maybe.\n\n2. Map size: As far as I can tell, the maps are not very large, and are not procedurally generated. HOWEVER this might (and probably will) change in the future.\n\nTL;DR\nVery good game with solid gameplay, beautiful graphics, a lot of controls but easy to use, and smooth overall. Not many cons other than the map size. Very early access so there isn't much content yet, however, I recommend this game for sure.\n\nI hope this review helped you make a decision. :)","February 19, 2015","true","160.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Well worth 20 bucks if you enjoy building castles.\n\nLong Review-\nPros\nHard game to stop playing.  There is always one more build to attempt and one more looky-loo at your creation.  After spending 3-4 hours messing around, learing the controls, I have been putting together an imense mountain castle that includes a drawbridge, portculi, dozens of towers, houses, and catapults.  It is easy to get lost in your work while hours pass by.  The graphics are beautiful, and on my new Alienware, I see the grass and trees sway in the breeze.  I get the same feeling playing this game that I got as a kid playing with legos nonstop, oblivious to the world.\nBut, there are a few problems that can be frustrating.\nIt's Alpha.  There is clunkiness to the controls, especially in clearing debris.\nAs others have mentioned, the buildings you constuct need to be over-engineered or they will tumble down.  There is a lack of variety of materials to flesh out your castle: a bed, table, dresser, and a chair is all you get for now.\nRoofs can be very anoying to place correctly and if you misplace, you often delete the walls underneath in addition to the section of roof.\nYou also have only a half a dozen maps to choose from, none of which are overly large.  There is no water as of yet, so no moats.  Smoothing terrain is perhaps the most frustrating part of the game for me so far.  Instead of pushing down on terrain, you add up.  The controls are clunky, awkward, and no way to take away or delete terrain.  No food, crops, animals, resources, blacksmithing, or fine crafting of any type.\nFlying can test your nerves as well.  Gravity doesn't exist if flying mode, so inertia sends you at mach 1 with just a touch of the controls.  You often need to be in the perfect spot to place a block, and the inertia controls require fine little pushes in the direction you want to travel in.  Plus, you are invulnerable and if you send yourself flying into a wall, if often comes tumbling down as cuss words tumble out of your mouth.\nYou can't name saved games, which can be anoying and load times can be long.  Finally, my last gripe is copying and pasting.  Currently, you copy everything already created.  So, let's say your castle is rocking, but you want to add some catapults.  You are forced to save, restart a new game, create your catapult, copy, exit game, and finally go back to your saved castle to plop and paste the weapons.\nBut, and I can't stress this enough, the game is very adicting.  For an Alpha, it's more than playable and it should only get better with more features being brought in.  Multiplayer could be a blast, as long as they toughen up the integrity of your creations or battles could be very very quick.  Overall, two fat thumbs up!","February 24, 2015","true","83.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Is it worth to buy it???????\nYes it is worth it, although they could decrease the price of it. BUT they really have to change and add things. The game really has to change the hitboxen and have to add more wild life, but also they have to add DOORS!!.  And they must add more biomes with a no border map, like Minecraft. But this are just my oppions that I think the game makes awesome. But one with really has to change, the graphics and smoothness.\n\nSo to sum up, the game is awesome and it is worth to buy it.

At the moment, I\'d advise everyone to still hold off until they release WAY more content and easier-to-use items/interfaces.\n\nWith space engineers, things are reletively intuative. With this - even in creative mode- it is one of the most frustration experuiences in learnign a game i can remember. It looks awesome, but if you are not building a castle and destroying it, there is no other purpose. Trying to build other items is not really a joke, but rather an annoyance since things dont\' seem to snap where they should, and items do not have an instinctual purpose. With such little content out there to help teach you and answer FAQ\'s, this game is just not worth the $20 it currently is.\nAgain, EVEN IN CREATIVE mode, it lacks appeal and dissapoints; I have more fun with Legos and I\'m 34.","May 31","false","20.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

At the time of this review the follow mechanical problems exist:\nWhen trying to build a circular tower, you cannot build a staircase within it because the staircase... touches...?... the walls.\n\nYou cannot build things directly on top of wooden platforms, instead the object you place on the wooden platform is elevated a few centimeters above it.\n\nI have only briefly played this game and therefore these are the only things that have disrupted my game play. So far I have yet to see a bug, although controlling the character both in first person, third person and free mode is rather awkward. The graphics are very nice, it runs smoothly but I would like to see the loading time decreased significantally. I just recently read some of the negative reviews and I have to say, PLEASE remember that this is an ALPHA GAME. There isn't a lot of content, the game is sometimes buggy and will run relatively bad on some computers.

I have no doubt in my mind this game wont succeed if the devs put the same amount of work and effort into both listening to the fanbase and keeping new content flowing as they did with Space Engineers.\n\nNow they are missing alot at the moment from resource gathering to even rope tention so my monstrousity of a trebuche can't actually fire the ball. None the less i have no doubt that both of these along with multiplayer will be coming soon due to my past experience with these devs. Never had any issues with major bugs in their games and they've earned my trust for sure.\n\nSo im very excited to see more content be released to build onto what theyve already started.

Sort of. It plays alot like space engineers, which is a good thing, but it it has the creative factor that minecraft used to have. Its incomplete, its got some bugs, especially in block rotation and placement. You also cant delete debris yet, but there are ways around this. And structural integrity is a great feature, If you build like you might, in say minecraft or even space engineers, the game will punish you. you have to think ahead, what's going to need support, will x block be strong enough, etc. Its like playing with your cat, one moment everything is great, all is well, but then you do just the wrong thing and your getting bitten or clawed. but you don't mind, you keep on playing, because just like your cat, Medieval Engineers is just too lovable to stop playing, even if it does leave you cut and bleeding.\n\nAs far as debris is concerned there are two ways of dealing with it. One is to wait for them to delete themselves after a few minutes, but this wont get rid of blocks still intact enough to count are a full block but have come loose. Alternatly you can start a game, then save and go back to the main menu, go to load the save, but instead of loading your save go to edit settings and set the debris limit to 0. Blocks will still break and loose blocks will still fall, and poorly built structures will still colapse. But, there will be no anoying little debris that you can't delete with a right click. Beyond that, everything else is straight forward.\n\nBuy it now while its on beta discount, you wont regret it.","February 20, 2015","true","164.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

It was a fantastic game when it first came out but the amount of bugs it currently has will make you regret spending the money.\n\nI'll preface this by saying that I was super excited to get this game when it first became available. As soon as I could I was playing it and I was amazed how well it worked for an alpha. At first there were very minor issues and bugs but overall the game was very playable, it was just a little lacking in features.\n\nThen they started to pander to the people demanding a survival mode and multiplayer (before the underlying systems were fully there). The result? More bugs than you'd find in a hoarder's house.\n\nNow I keep having the game just display blinding white, blocks that refuse to fit together like they had before, and control issues. It seems every update they add just makes things worse. Hell, most updates seem to be them trying to make multiplayer function more than trying to get the base game working.\n\nCall me crazy but multiplayer needs to be dealt with after the basic functions are all there. Otherwise you have a completely unplayable game rather than just a limited one.\n\nThe problems Keen had with Space Engineers got resolved and I have no worries that Medieval Engineers will end up working. At the moment though, they are trying to do too much so you need to wait until the game can be finished so save yourself the headaches of wanting to play the game, but quitting because of the bugs.\n\nI used to spend hours building cities and castles, now I avoid the game. I come back to it every once in a while but right now, it’s best to just not play it.\n\nThe videos you see were how the game played on original release. Literally, what you see in the videos they show you was how the game looked and worked in April 2015.

Ever looked at a floating building with despair?\n\nThen THIS is the game for you. Composite building and structural integrity mean you can build a realistic building where the design matters far more than in any other game of this kind.\n\nI have clocked quite a few hours on this so far, and I can see myself whiling away a good chunk of my spare time here. I love the way you can build structures from deep basements to towering watchtowers that will collapse if I do it wrong!\n\nDon't get me wrong, the physics aren't too punishing. You won't have your buildings falling apart every five minutes. It's just a relief to build structural supports where they actually have an effect.\n\nThe potential of this game has only just begun to be realized. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys building. Also, to anyone who loves to destroy and test the strength of a tower.\n\n[Addition] After a couple of months, I do find a degree of frustration with this game. Lag and frame drop are a very real issue everytime you know down a building. As I see much of the fun of this game in the destruction of what I build, this has become a real disappointment. I also love the idea of playing multiplayer, and running through a building my friend is destroying. Again though, lag is intense when destroying things, making this an almost unplayable feature.\n\nIt is my hope that this game will improve, but it might be worth waiting a while.","May 17, 2015","true","40.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Destructions cool, building is one of the most frustrating things, the snap on building is the absolute worst, causing you to accidently delete important parts of buildings causing a good 10 minutes of work to crumble down before you its cool to watch but can really be frustrating. Structural integrity is definitly not like in the videos.

The game right now is small, so I can allready take a solid review.\nWhen I firstly launched the world, I felt like I have just appeared in the Medieval Era. The nicest medieval music and nice grassy plain met me with happiness and temptation. Then, turning left 135 degrees, I saw a house. I walked to it and sat inside, feeling really cozy. Although, then I saw big projectile in my belt. Of course, it is really obvious what to do. I saw how to control those in a really friendly presented tutorial. So, I walked out from that cozy 15th century house and picked up my projectile and BOOOM. The house is to the ground. Great havoc-ish damage physics - KSH always deals with those damage physics, in all their recent games.\nOkay, I wanted to build a castle like this Neuschwanstein one. I found a mountain, terraformed a bit of ground for the keep and started building. I made a nice guard tower, which fromed so SOFTLY and INTUITIVE, which I can't say for some games, even, sometimes, Space Engineers. I copied the tower, although, it took me a big bite of my time to mess around with copying and pasting it. I couldn't rotate it. Although, I am going to close my eyes on ot - it's a magnificent alpha.\nSo, I saw another problem - maybe I am doing something wrong, or don't know how to do it. But I built my towers sideways to the "voxel grid". I would need to build my walls the wacked way. *Sadface:(*\n\nSo, let's see, what is positive, and negative about this game.\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n1. Nice, Fluid and intuitive building system.\n2. Nice graphics. Not the best, but they are good for the game of this type.\n3. MAGNIFICENT damage physics, and structual integrity.\n4. Mechanical elements. And weapons, that you build yourself, which means, that if you are in multiplayer, better you build your Trebushetes ( or smth. ), the better you will siege.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Sometimes crashes. You can drop this off, because it's an early acces game.\n2. Hard terradorming. You need to get your hands dirty and whack for a little bit, before building.\n3.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/recommended/333950/","tgr1","Kelly Osbourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/","436 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nKeen Software House has come crashing down to Earth, it seems. Hot off the heels of their success with Space Engineers, the studio has taken a decidedly different approach to its next game. Yes, they’ve swapped the dark, lonely nothingness of outer space for the green and pleasant fields on Terra Firma. And whilst the core gameplay of Medieval Engineers is, in essence, no different from Space Engineers – build stuff, destroy stuff – it goes that extra mile to engross you in its twee setting. Medieval Engineers, like Space Engineers before it, launched as an Early Access title with a solid amount of content, and whilst its current incarnation only lets you build stuff just to knock it down, it gives an exciting glimpse at the possible shape the game might take in the future.\n\nBefore you can indulge in senseless destruction you’ve got to build something first and, even at this early stage, the creation tools on offer are surprisingly slick. You can choose from a different number of fields to start out in, be it a rocky hill terrain, or a plain with a castle town already in it. Building your own castles using the various building blocks available to you is a cinch, and the auto-snap grid means that you will line everything up correctly – almost every time! I say “almost” because, at present it can be a real pain the undersatchel to line up floor panels. That’s before I have even touched on the terraforming tools.\n\nSo, you’ve started building that ridiculously oversized mountain fortress and want to even out the ground a little, well it isn’t  going to be that easy. Terraforming, in theory, should be easy: you pick your brush shape, give it a width, height and depth, and can set about adding or subtracting ground blocks to the scene. There’s a bit of an art to it though, meaning you need a steady hand to keep things smooth – otherwise you end up with ground that has the texture of artex. Indeed, my inability to use the tool effectively saw me creating underground caverns that had an eerily beautiful quality to them, but I couldn’t get out! Hopefully, future releases will see these tools tweaked a bit for people like myself (idiots, basically).\n\n\nYou needn’t build alone, either! Get a buddy or two in on the action and you’ll be up and running with a serviceable castle in no time; the system really is just that astonishingly easy to use. Think of it like minecraft where each block looks different and has different properties – except they aren’t cubes, of course. There are all sorts of different blocks at your disposal, from round-edged  walls for turrets, battlement attachments, and windmill blades for the show-offs.\n\nHumans will be human and it’s in our nature to tear down and destroy, and Medieval Engineers has you well covered in that department. Technical dunces like myself can equip small and large cannonballs to their hotbar and let rip a volley of shots on their structures, watching them crumble to the ground in a cloud of smoke and dust. There’s a perverse pleasure to be had in seeing your time-consuming efforts reduced to nought but rubble within a few minutes,  a feeling which is amplified by the warming celtic soundtrack that plays throughout. It’s a highly incongruous matchup, but also very enjoyable. You can further amplify the destruction by kicking your map’s maximum fracture pieces all the way to the top – your PC won’t thank you for it, but it sure as hell looks amazing! If you have the technical cojones to create catapults, trebuchets and other machines of war you can also set your mind free to think up the most dastardly creations it can. When you are done you can upload them to the Steam Workshop for others to enjoy – a feature that will no doubt become inundated with cool items I only wish I had the skills to create.\n\n\nThere is so much untapped potential waiting to come out of Medieval Engineers that it’s difficult to see what form the final game will take. Keen have recently released an update featuring barbarians so who knows, maybe we will see a full-on medieval war simulator, with massive castle-vs-castle battles? I’ll see you all there when I manage to get out of this damn hole!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDisclosure: Preview key provided by Keen.

You have to realize though:\n1) This is still an Early Access game. Some of the features you EXPECT in this game, may not be applied yet.\n2) It came out not too long ago. You have to give it time before you negatively affect the reviews.\n\nAs of now, There isnt much to do, but master the games mechanics and learn how to build. You can destroy things, and as of yesterday i believe, You are able to spawn barbarians to do the destroying for you.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game if it wasnt for one slight detail.\n\nThe developers are active. They are informing the community and are searching for ways to improve the game. Great people, and i do not believe they would abandon a game that was already advanced into early access. Especially since they can see the potential. We all have seen games where the devs havent notified the community in months. No updates in a year or so, and all the updates they do are just average bug fixes. I can tell you from my time playing Space Engineers (SE) That this is not the case.\n\nNote: Please also take into account that they are still working forward in SE. They applied workshop for us to keep ourselves entertained so they can have time to get what they need done, done. It's not a fast process.\nI will keep updating this as time moves along, as of right now the question is simple:\n\nDo you want to be part of a growing, excited community and support the devs?\n\n*UPDATE* 3/10/2015\n\nFinally added some new things! They now added barbarians, a survival setting where barbarians will attack your king statue every certain amount of minutes! Im really excited about this update. however, there are still many glitches.\n\nLike turning into jesus after throwing a cannonball.\nFreeze Framing in midair.\nAlong with, barbarians attacking eachother instead of the statue,\nBarbarians throwing cannon balls BACK AT YOU (kobe),\nand The whole building youre in collapsing from one hit. lol.\n\nThe glitches so far are very amusing. That is why i still suggest this game.\n\nI will keep updates as the game goes on.\n\n*UPDATE*  3/25/2015\n\nThey finally!! Added!!! Ragdolls!!! You now have a day and night cycle. Which makes the survival more a bit more interesting. Along with that you know have pick axes, and other hand tools such as the torch and mace for defense.\n\nI have yet to try the full experience for the survival mode, for ive been very busy, as soon as i do i will update again. I'm hoping they added material requirments in survival mode to build with. Either way this game keeps getting better and better.\n\nThe developers are cracking down hard on this game. However the only MAJOR con that i can see in this game so far, (well besides the things they havent added yet) Is the ability to spawn bots. Yes, this is an early access game and they probably dont have the patches to support alot of bots walking around the world at this time but i feel if you want to crash your game? crash it. lol. Right now you are only able to spawn 4 to 5 barbarians and and 3 peasants. Peasants will stockpile your ammo crates. Where they stockpile them at though is not under your control at this time.\n\nExample:\nI buillt a Practical castle. 4 walls. Each corner had a rotating catauplt on it. Outside I build a couple houses for scenery. Inside the castle were:\nBarracks\nA main hall\nMess hall\nCourtyard\nStatue\nGarden\nand War room. along with an extra hidden passage out. (i havent yet mastered the art of digging underground so it was just a doorway hidden by bushes and trees.\nI was launching my catapults for fun, and decided to test out the peasants. I noticed he took the ammo off of my catapult head every time i spawned one before i could launch it. This took my interest. I followed this young fellow of which i named jerry. I followed him far and wide. Out of the reaches of my castle. Through the hidden passage. Far into the reaches of the forests. Passed the hills. The he stopped. only for a second. Dropped the rock. Turned around and ran back to the castle. -_-\nI stayed put trying to figure out why he dropped the rock there. I waited. He came back with another rock. Dropped it in the same place.\nTo speed things up, i spawned in 2 more peasants. To which they continued to fight over where the rocks would be placed. one would pick it up. walk over five feet and drop it. to which the other would pick it up and run another five feet and drop it. This continued until the other one came back with YET ANOTHER rock.... At which time they killed eachother by picking it up (and i guess glitching) And causing two of them to ragdoll.\n\nOther than that, yes i recommend this game. The devs are hammering down to add new parts. In the end it will truly be an amazing game.","February 26, 2015","true","9.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You have to realize though:\n1) This is still an Early Access game. Some of the features you EXPECT in this game, may not be applied yet.\n2) It came out not too long ago. You have to give it time before you negatively affect the reviews.\n\nAs of now, There isnt much to do, but master the games mechanics and learn how to build. You can destroy things, and as of yesterday i believe, You are able to spawn barbarians to do the destroying for you.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game if it wasnt for one slight detail.\n\nThe developers are active. They are informing the community and are searching for ways to improve the game. Great people, and i do not believe they would abandon a game that was already advanced into early access. Especially since they can see the potential. We all have seen games where the devs havent notified the community in months. No updates in a year or so, and all the updates they do are just average bug fixes. I can tell you from my time playing Space Engineers (SE) That this is not the case.\n\nNote: Please also take into account that they are still working forward in SE. They applied workshop for us to keep ourselves entertained so they can have time to get what they need done, done. It's not a fast process.\nI will keep updating this as time moves along, as of right now the question is simple:\n\nDo you want to be part of a growing, excited community and support the devs?\n\n*UPDATE* 3/10/2015\n\nFinally added some new things! They now added barbarians, a survival setting where barbarians will attack your king statue every certain amount of minutes! Im really excited about this update. however, there are still many glitches.\n\nLike turning into jesus after throwing a cannonball.\nFreeze Framing in midair.\nAlong with, barbarians attacking eachother instead of the statue,\nBarbarians throwing cannon balls BACK AT YOU (kobe),\nand The whole building youre in collapsing from one hit. lol.\n\nThe glitches so far are very amusing. That is why i still suggest this game.\n\nI will keep updates as the game goes on.\n\n*UPDATE*  3/25/2015\n\nThey finally!! Added!!! Ragdolls!!! You now have a day and night cycle. Which makes the survival more a bit more interesting. Along with that you know have pick axes, and other hand tools such as the torch and mace for defense.\n\nI have yet to try the full experience for the survival mode, for ive been very busy, as soon as i do i will update again. I'm hoping they added material requirments in survival mode to build with. Either way this game keeps getting better and better.\n\nThe developers are cracking down hard on this game. However the only MAJOR con that i can see in this game so far, (well besides the things they havent added yet) Is the ability to spawn bots. Yes, this is an early access game and they probably dont have the patches to support alot of bots walking around the world at this time but i feel if you want to crash your game? crash it. lol. Right now you are only able to spawn 4 to 5 barbarians and and 3 peasants. Peasants will stockpile your ammo crates. Where they stockpile them at though is not under your control at this time.\n\nExample:\nI buillt a Practical castle. 4 walls. Each corner had a rotating catauplt on it. Outside I build a couple houses for scenery. Inside the castle were:\nBarracks\nA main hall\nMess hall\nCourtyard\nStatue\nGarden\nand War room. along with an extra hidden passage out. (i havent yet mastered the art of digging underground so it was just a doorway hidden by bushes and trees.\nI was launching my catapults for fun, and decided to test out the peasants. I noticed he took the ammo off of my catapult head every time i spawned one before i could launch it. This took my interest. I followed this young fellow of which i named jerry. I followed him far and wide. Out of the reaches of my castle. Through the hidden passage. Far into the reaches of the forests. Passed the hills. The he stopped. only for a second. Dropped the rock. Turned around and ran back to the castle. -_-\nI stayed put trying to figure out why he dropped the rock there. I waited. He came back with another rock. Dropped it in the same place.\nTo speed things up, i spawned in 2 more peasants. To which they continued to fight over where the rocks would be placed. one would pick it up. walk over five feet and drop it. to which the other would pick it up and run another five feet and drop it. This continued until the other one came back with YET ANOTHER rock.... At which time they killed eachother by picking it up (and i guess glitching) And causing two of them to ragdoll.\n\nOther than that, yes i recommend this game. The devs are hammering down to add new parts. In the end it will truly be an amazing game.","February 26, 2015","true","9.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

In other words there isn't much of a goal right now. It's solely a sandbox. That isn't a bad thing by any means because the game is beautiful, has a realy cool sound track and the physics are phenominal. It's taken them roughly a year to get to this point and it will probably take a couple more years before the game really starts to come alive. But right now the game is still pretty damn cool.

You are extremely limited in what you can do at this time.\n\nEssentially, you only have 'creative mode' available to you at this moment, but if Keen updates this with the same pacing and quality of Space Engineers, then you can expect frequent and awesome changes to come hard and fast.\n\nDAY 1 Pros:\n-Textures (even if placeholders) are beautiful and rich. The forest landscape reminds me of Elder Scrolls Oblivion.\n-DirectX 11 and multithreading offer stability and  terrific multiplayer opportunities down the road.\n-Destruction is very well designed and the physics seems solid.\n\nDay 1 Cons:\n-If the projectiles are the same mass and velocity to the eventual siege weapons, then stone walls will need to be a lot more durable, because right now they seem to be as strong as cardboard.\n-No multiplayer or survival at day one. This is expected, but I just want it to be obvious if you are going to buy the game based on that.\n-A distinct lack of goats.\n\nSummary: Game has extremely high amounts of potential and is already fun to tinker about inside the world. Software company that makes it is very considerate of their players and will update frequently and deliver.","February 19, 2015","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Doesn't everybody want to do that?\n\nJust don't get too attached to anything you make right now, or rely on mods, because it's quite likely, probably a certainty, that changes to the game will break your stuff on a regular basis.

I've been waiting for what seems like weeks to play this game even though it was only 4 days. This game is definetly worth the money, however remember it is in an alpha stage. Which simply means they only have a creative mode which is still very fun. They will most likely have updates and add more content in the game like they did with space engineers. This gaming company is incredible and one of my personal favorites. They give their customers who have space engineers a 25% discount on their new game. Now that is a true representation of loyalty to customers. I look forward to what they have planned in the future and again if you are still debating whether to buy the game or not it is a simple answer. And trust me you will not be disappointed. Now I'm gonna leave with one thought which is that my friend and I thought of an idea for the next engineering game. Aqua Engineers. Now I know that the gamemakers have their hands full with medieval engineers, but it is an idea for the future.\n\nP.S.\nIf you do use the Aqua Engineering idea for a game be sure to give my friend nuclearunderpants credit too.

Space Engineers is one of the most well done early access games ever done and I expect no less from Medieval Engineers. I'm proud to be part of the development phase because this is the game I've dreamed of since I was a kid. The physics engine is amazing - very similar to what Red Faction: Guerrilla did years ago. The graphics are phenomenal and I cannot wait until day/night/weather cycles are added. A giant castle with the interior lit with torches is going to look incredible.\n\nThe game simply has loads of potential and I cannot wait to see what future updates will bring. Even at this point the game is worth it - base price of $20 for an incredible creative mode that simply no other game can offer.\n\nWhat separates this game from Minecraft, Terraria, etc. is that the creations you make feel alive and anchored to real life physics. If there is too much weight on a column it will collapse. That is so cool and it's amazing so few games have even attempted this.\n\nThis game is recommended to anyone interested in the whole voxel/creation type genre or even those who have the slightest interest in Medieval tech/construction. Buy it, you won't regret the purchase.\n\nEDIT: Please be aware there are some frustrating things in this game but it does not change my positive opinion/outlook on the title:\n\n- Trees/bushes cannot be built over/removed - you have to shoot projectiles at them hoping not to destroy whatever creation is around them\n\n- The mechanical pieces are very wonky - even basic catapults are very difficult to use\n\n- If you make a mistake building with structural integrity on you have to wait a few minutes until the debris clears to rebuild. You can't manually remove debris","February 19, 2015","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So I go buy it for 20 euros and go install it. The instalation + download took aprox. 10 minutes with the download speed of 2.1MB/s, and it's just like between 3000MB and 3600MB. So I open it up and i see the classy backround, with some gameplay of it, but instead of crashing space ships 24/24, I see some real gameplay, building some castles, catapults, shooting the castles, the fall of these and so on. Then  I decide to play with my friend, but he tells me that there's NO kind of multyplayer, YET and it should be here in a few days. That didn't bother me that much, so I started up a "creative" large word (cuz who the ♥♥♥♥ plays the tutorial anymore? ) and start hearing EPIC medieval music, the thing that highly impressed me. So I go try random buttons, since I didn't see the tutorial and find out that all the commands are the same. The G, TAB, F1, V and so on, do the exactly same thing. Ok, this makes the game easier for the players of Space Engineers, but a little bit more boring at the same time. So I start building up my castle, and found it hard to bild all of it up, so I randomly press X and pray to the Gods i have a jetpack, and I actually had one. I started flying and flying going up and up and  yhen got speed and hit a tree with like 200 km/h. The tree flew away and started destroying all the trees around, 1/2 of the map's forrest, ok, no problem, moving on. Built up my castle, destroyed it and that's all for now.\nIn the end I reccomend this game and I believe it can be better in the future when Multiplayer is going to be added.\nOh and I also broke the game somehow, I selected the sphere thing that erases ground and started flying towards the ground and holding right click. I was deleting around 1000 miles deep per sec, then I found myself in the void, with some flowers flying everywhere, so yeah, don't do that...\nIn the end (x2) at the moment I give the game a 9/10 and IGN gives it 420/10 and says: 'It's ok...' and I say what I just sayed.","February 22, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They keep in contact with the community. They make meaningful updates weekly. They are very honest and open about their plans and direction with the game, and best of all THEIR GAME WORKS! Medieval Engineers -- aside from some bugs and optimization -- is already at a state where they could go full release! The building mechanics are solid and it doesn't take long before you're making your dream castle! They give you enough tools to let your imagination run wild, especially the blocks within blocks tool! Compound blocks allows you to invent new blocks on the fly to suit your design, making you have that extra level of detail to any creatoin. The added structural integrity mode makes building feel more like a challenge. You have to be aware of how much weight is being placed on certain blocks. It adds an air of tension while you're building, "Oh gosh will this block be the one to ruin my castle?" The game gets a new sense of tension in this mode and I love it for this!

Most recent review update: 3/3/15- - - -\n\nThis game is incredible and exactly what I paid for. A game stressed upon physics that has near limitless capabilities, based upon construction, destruction, rinse and repeat. 8/10, but since it came out only a few days ago, I'd say it deserves those extra points for being this fantastic right from the get-go. If you want an awesome game, buy now. If you want a game you'll(or at least I'll) play for the rest of your life after a few months period of updates, Buy. Now. All in all, there are some drawbacks, but it's almost 98% positive fun gameplay. That is, if your "Fun" includes architectural design and physics used to demolish everything in sight.\n\n+Positive+\n+Even the medium graphics are incredible. If you have a tough system, please play on the highest graphics possible, for the beauty of the scenery is astounding. +30 points\n+The physics engine is to DIE for. I've been craving a game of this caliber for my entire life. Want a bridge that splits in the middle and slides into sockets? Do it. Want a machine gun catapult? Do. It. Want a rope suspended bridge that rebounds against cannon balls? Do. +70 points\n+The versatility of what you can make is awe-inspiring. You could make a system of pulleys and winches that operates 20 catapults surrounding a castle to demolish it in one fell swoop(or alternatively, miss with every single one and destroy your beautiful catapults.). +40 points\n+Realizing what I've said earlier, I'd like to build upon it all. Since windmills are most definitely usable, you could make. A fully automated, wind powered line of catapults that reloads itself and launches projectiles infinitely until it runs out of ammo. +(does this even count)10 points\n+It just came out and it's this good already. Also, frequent updates. +50 points\n+Barbarians are cool and the fact that they were added in earlier than they should have is good to see their mechanics beforehand and find good ways to build defendable fortresses before their AI gets revamped. +10 points\n\n-Negative-\nThese points generally have more written, but that's because they need more explaining.\n-Long loading times, but this is expected if you've played Space Engineers, and isn't really a problem once you've got a world loaded. -5 points\n-Lag. If you have a system with generally low specs, you might want to consider getting a new computer to play, or taking countermeasures to weaken the game's stress on your speed. However, having a low-end computer myself, the lag is not unbearable, and fully understandable considering the powerful physics engine. -10 points, though this is only a user-related issue. If you have a strong system, BUY.\n-One of the core reasons there is so much lag is the worlds. Sure, the forests look beautiful, but I'm in creative mode. Shouldn't I get a choice of a very small world with no forests? The trees and the rest of the world are a source of great lag, while I am trying to build a trebuchet to demolish this finely structured building in front of me. Smaller worlds are needed. -30 points\n-No legitimate hands-on tools/weapons. What I mean is this: Space Engineers had player-wielded machine gun rifles, yes? Then these engineers should get swords. I want to sword fight on my castle as it crumbles. Obviously this shouldn't be stressed until multiplayer comes, or DEFINITELY when true NPC raiding parties come. Also, the raiding parties should not be limited to swords, they should get at least simple siege weaponry i.e. a catapult they pull with them. Also, when these NPCs do come around, ideally they should be able to take keeps and/or spawn in keeps with the map, so they can be raided and taken over. -5 points\n-There is a moderately bad bug involving broken stone cubes, I believe it is due to parts of the stone cubes that DO break getting partially lodged in the unbroken parts, keeping them both elevated and preventing you from placing blocks for repairs unless you damage the block further yourself(which can cause more damage to the surrounding area) and dig a hole underneath, place a block so that the physics reload and the fragments fall, and fill the hole back up, all so you can make repairs. Also, sometimes the fragments that are stuck midair cannot even be broken. This is but a small bug however, and I pretty much covered the whole thing in that paragraph. -5 points (Partially fixed the bug. You go, guys!)\n\nAfter all that, still +155 points.\n\nThe best part of all of it? Mindless destruction. And why that is the best part is that it's not even mindless. It takes full consciousness and mental focus to build a machine capable of laying waste to fortresses from afar. Thank you, thank you for this wonderful gift of a game. And I thought SPACE Engineers was good. Compared to this, I'd say SE is half the game this is/will be.","February 21, 2015","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The limited initial lineup of blocks to build with has been balanced by the ability to merge blocks. The basic technology and small blocks also grant a lot of freedom in design. The developers have a good track record for content updates as well as listening to the community, so I am confident that this game will fill out well as it develops.","February 20, 2015","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So I go buy it for 20 euros and go install it. The instalation + download took aprox. 10 minutes with the download speed of 2.1MB/s, and it's just like between 3000MB and 3600MB. So I open it up and i see the classy backround, with some gameplay of it, but instead of crashing space ships 24/24, I see some real gameplay, building some castles, catapults, shooting the castles, the fall of these and so on. Then  I decide to play with my friend, but he tells me that there's NO kind of multyplayer, YET and it should be here in a few days. That didn't bother me that much, so I started up a "creative" large word (cuz who the ♥♥♥♥ plays the tutorial anymore? ) and start hearing EPIC medieval music, the thing that highly impressed me. So I go try random buttons, since I didn't see the tutorial and find out that all the commands are the same. The G, TAB, F1, V and so on, do the exactly same thing. Ok, this makes the game easier for the players of Space Engineers, but a little bit more boring at the same time. So I start building up my castle, and found it hard to bild all of it up, so I randomly press X and pray to the Gods i have a jetpack, and I actually had one. I started flying and flying going up and up and  yhen got speed and hit a tree with like 200 km/h. The tree flew away and started destroying all the trees around, 1/2 of the map's forrest, ok, no problem, moving on. Built up my castle, destroyed it and that's all for now.\nIn the end I reccomend this game and I believe it can be better in the future when Multiplayer is going to be added.\nOh and I also broke the game somehow, I selected the sphere thing that erases ground and started flying towards the ground and holding right click. I was deleting around 1000 miles deep per sec, then I found myself in the void, with some flowers flying everywhere, so yeah, don't do that...\nIn the end (x2) at the moment I give the game a 9/10 and IGN gives it 420/10 and says: 'It's ok...' and I say what I just sayed.","February 22, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most recent review update: 3/3/15- - - -\n\nThis game is incredible and exactly what I paid for. A game stressed upon physics that has near limitless capabilities, based upon construction, destruction, rinse and repeat. 8/10, but since it came out only a few days ago, I'd say it deserves those extra points for being this fantastic right from the get-go. If you want an awesome game, buy now. If you want a game you'll(or at least I'll) play for the rest of your life after a few months period of updates, Buy. Now. All in all, there are some drawbacks, but it's almost 98% positive fun gameplay. That is, if your "Fun" includes architectural design and physics used to demolish everything in sight.\n\n+Positive+\n+Even the medium graphics are incredible. If you have a tough system, please play on the highest graphics possible, for the beauty of the scenery is astounding. +30 points\n+The physics engine is to DIE for. I've been craving a game of this caliber for my entire life. Want a bridge that splits in the middle and slides into sockets? Do it. Want a machine gun catapult? Do. It. Want a rope suspended bridge that rebounds against cannon balls? Do. +70 points\n+The versatility of what you can make is awe-inspiring. You could make a system of pulleys and winches that operates 20 catapults surrounding a castle to demolish it in one fell swoop(or alternatively, miss with every single one and destroy your beautiful catapults.). +40 points\n+Realizing what I've said earlier, I'd like to build upon it all.

Most recent review update: 3/3/15- - - -\n\nThis game is incredible and exactly what I paid for. A game stressed upon physics that has near limitless capabilities, based upon construction, destruction, rinse and repeat. 8/10, but since it came out only a few days ago, I'd say it deserves those extra points for being this fantastic right from the get-go. If you want an awesome game, buy now. If you want a game you'll(or at least I'll) play for the rest of your life after a few months period of updates, Buy. Now. All in all, there are some drawbacks, but it's almost 98% positive fun gameplay. That is, if your "Fun" includes architectural design and physics used to demolish everything in sight.\n\n+Positive+\n+Even the medium graphics are incredible. If you have a tough system, please play on the highest graphics possible, for the beauty of the scenery is astounding. +30 points\n+The physics engine is to DIE for. I've been craving a game of this caliber for my entire life. Want a bridge that splits in the middle and slides into sockets? Do it. Want a machine gun catapult? Do. It. Want a rope suspended bridge that rebounds against cannon balls? Do. +70 points\n+The versatility of what you can make is awe-inspiring. You could make a system of pulleys and winches that operates 20 catapults surrounding a castle to demolish it in one fell swoop(or alternatively, miss with every single one and destroy your beautiful catapults.). +40 points\n+Realizing what I've said earlier, I'd like to build upon it all.

Now with MORE to destroy and a very impressive integrity software, the Space Engineers dubbed themselves.....The Medieval Engineers!\n\n\nOkay now for what I think. With the new update out and all of the previous information I really enjoy Medieval Engineers. As I said the integrity software is VERY enjoyable. I've spent almost 1/2 my time watching large castles and trees fall with awing enviroment interaction.

That the developers are pouring out unfinished games to get the moola. But I don't see this being the case, not while features are being implemented to both games to complement the development. People will tell you that this is the reason they half ♥♥♥♥♥ Space Engineers, but then again these people were the ones who took frequent updates for granted.\n\nThough the game hasn't got too much, which was the case with SE, it is enjoyable if you enjoy building with an added challenge. The game allows you build out fantasy or medieval settings to your heart's content but with the fact these buildings must be constructed with structural integrity in mind.  Due to that system, the destruction of the buildings are incredibly satisfying... or heartbreaking, depending on what side of the wall you're on.  Not forgetting a pully system that puts your medieval engineering to the test with elaborate gates, mechanisms and siege weaponry.\n\nThe game has a lot of potential in the terms of PVP, Roleplay and Sandbox pleasure you might find in similar games. To say the least, they have added a fresh taste to this somewhat bloated genre. I just hope they make a decent survival element to it all.","February 22, 2015","true","19.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The devs. keep updating Space Engineers, and will most likely keep this game updated as well. I wanted Space Engineers because I liked the idea of an open sandbox build game in space, but now that they have a Medieval Engineers, I knew I had to have it.

Even in the current unpolished state, the game is addictive and hits a chord that few other games can hit. The destruction physics are entertaining and challenging. The desire to build is constantly driven by "how big can I make this" and "how can I hit this with a cannonball and make it fall". As features continue to expand, I expect to see this game become a wonderful gem of the gaming world.\n\nI would disreguard most of the negative reviews on here because they seem to have missed the point that this game is in extremely early stages. For it to function as it does with the minimal bugs and issues is very impressive. As well, the dev team is extremely invested and dedicated to giving the community what they want. The collaborations between the Medieval and Space engineers devs is something of a golden goose. Expect to see a lot of wonderful new content in Space Engineers as well as ME. If you are truly interested in this game, don't hesitate, support the devs now and save yourself some cash. You won't regret it.\n\n(Also disreguard the lack of hours as I have been extremely busy and haven't been able to play as much as I wish.)","February 24, 2015","true","14.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Structural integrity is fun to toy around with and can make a serious impact on your build if you don't take it into consideration. I tried to make a huge stone floor, that was about 600+ blocks in total, in one go. And the whole thing collapsed and broke since it was only supported on 2 corners.

You want derpy servants that might actually be up to par with medieval intelligence?  Also yes.  Do you want contraptions that actually make sense in a physics based environment?

It has the nostalgic feel of medieval styled instruments, and never before has it felt so epic to build and explore. I can't help but compare this to Minecraft; the building is extensive and entertaining, as Minecraft very well achieved, however this game has the music that makes the game brilliant. Not too much content so far, but I'm sure in a couple months it's gonna be stock full with content.\nThe graphics aren't too bad; they have a Skyrim like feel to them and the scenery looks gorgeous even on low. The game isn't really optimised yet, destroying walls makes my graphics lag. I have a decent graphics card and I hope that the game will get optimisation.\nWhat's even better is this is coming from a developer that you can trust; Space Engineers has been out for about a year and every week there's still updates coming out. Just to reassure those who believe that now that this game has come out, Space Engineers is abandoned; that is false. The company who brought you the Engineers games have two teams working on both of the games, each meritting the same style of great game. These 'Engineers' games have been an interesting expirience for I know not just me, but for thousands, if not millions of people worldwide.\n***Review is Subject to Change***\n9/10\nNice graphics\nMinimal bugs\nGreat interface\nFantastic scenery\nBrilliant gameplay","February 21, 2015","true","2.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","0"

(There is nothing more fun than destroying stuff you built).\n2) stunning graphics.\n3) the possible construction areas, which require creativity and great design (because the laws of physics can be found in the game, not just so building, which adds a challenge and fun).\n\nBad:\n\n1) The game takes a long time to to be loaded.\n2) The ground editor very uncomfortable, and very unfriendly to new players.\n3) The voice of the barbarians annoying .. would be great if it would be possible to change the sound or mute the barbarians in particular.\n\nTo improve:\nI noticed a couple of things I would love if repaired or will be added to the game.\n1)I think it would be great if you feel the possibility of Ctrl + Z so that we can correct mistakes we made.\n2) I think that could be great if the world would be added flat type, so that it can be built on a flat surface without shape the surface of the earth.\n3) Would be great if added to the tool which can erase the ruins. It's quite annoying that you can not delete ruins and each time build a castle tower and he falls to start the game again and build it all again. (I must say that it makes the construction of a castle feel pretty stressful thing).\n\nIn conclusion, a great game.\nThe game can provide hours and hours of building castles and weapons medieval building demolition, careful planning of buildings.\nWould be great if he could contain multiplayer game, or at least co-op so that it can be done wars or joint construction (similar to space engineers).\nHighly recommanded , Buy it now !!\n11 \ 10!\n\n*by the way  , I apologize for my poor English .

PS: This is between better and much better than Space Engineers!  The Engineers franchise is awsome!  Bug 1: Somtimes when you destroy stuff, the debris floats!  FIX 2: There is not totaly realistic phisics, for example, when building a pillar of blocks then building to the side, you can build 10 blocks before it crumbles! PS: the last bit of my blocks were close to the ground.  Also my tower stood with a small support.  UNKOWN 3: On the map Bridges, the wagon makes the bridge crumble.  That shouldnt happen, because it has supports close to each other.  CRASH 4: When playing Bridges, my computer crashed.  Maybe its because I had graphics on presets  low and graghics qaulity on medium, medium is a bit laggy. SUJESTION 5: You should definetly add horses.  Also you should also make it were if a rope is attached to a rock, it shuold snap when under high G (Flying)  SUJJESTIION 6: You shuold add difrent blocks like cogs and gears and stone floors (Sideways variant of the stone wall) and wood panels (Sideways variant of the wooden floor).  Also you shuold add back in the catch blocks with block-type wood inside and add corner variants of the ceiling.  BUG 7:  Sometimes when deleting parts of a gate-type fashion (Wood in the fashion of the drawbridge) it flies, and it is realy easy to emplode when testing.  Also the drawbridges dont go down if as big as entrance with little stopers when retraced.\n\nI didnt realy know how to word my thoughts in the most part.\n\nEnderborn01","February 23, 2015","true","27.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

There are a few obvious bugs to be scratched quickly but so far this game is already amazing. Unlike Space Engineers I hope this game will become more of a multiplayer survival base game instead of just the space simulator that Space Engineers has been recently. The breaking is amazing and the integrety makes me a little wet but I just hope it doesn't all go to waste and become one of those games I play if I say "I wonder if I can..." rather than a game where I can say "Lets get on a server and make a castle I can defend!"\n\nI guess my point here is that space engineers is big on making things never seen with the tools at hand and while I love that about it I hope this game will be playable in survival strongly enough that there will be servers with average players that just want to build and be in a community.\n\nOh btw, 10/10 for an early release.

I've played Space Engineers, and I loved it, and this just seemed like more of the same thing in a different setting. The game is definitely beautiful, as far as looks go, but it was just another typical game where you build things.\n\nBut it's not. I just discovered "Compound building", which is a term I was unfamiliar with. I'd thought of the concept, and that it would be something I'd like in the many years I've played Minecraft, but I'd never seen a game that actually allowed it until this.\n\nGuys, it's literally blocks in blocks. You want that wood floor in the same block space as that stone wall? Compound building. It's so obvious that this feature should exist in everything, but somehow it hasn't until now.\n\n10/10 would build blocks in blocks again.","February 22, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Awesome\nPoint #3. Keen Software House. These guys (and Gals) know how to properly rock the Engineer Moustache. = Double Awesome Power. DAP Status confirmed.\n\nWarning: Lengthy review of shenaniganz incoming.\n\nOn a more serious note, about the game. Ahh the game. Structural integrity, so awesome while still inflicting fear and terror upon all engineers endeavoring on massive projects. You must think about your structures and gadgets with gravity in mind. It will destroy what you have worked so hard to build, and when it doesnt, when you have built not only a beautiful machine or structure, You have also built a structural masterpiece. Every support, each minor detail, Every stress point in your Project must be carefully managed and at times avoided. This game will make you or break you. It will wittle you down over the hours of time you spend on a single large scale project, you can make an error in your projects design only to realize it later, after you have built your monument to your ingenuity. Be careful my fellow Engineers, Gravity was once our ally in deep space. Now it is our enemy. Now quit screwin around and buy this game already. If not for Keens DAP status, then for Engineerings sake!\n\n\n\nOk. Actually serious now.\nKeen Software House reminds me of a company I knew and loved some time ago. They are honest, they care about their games. They care about what we say and we say alot (obviously /\ ). I would not have bought this game the day it came on alpha if I did not trust in its developers. I have played Space Engineers, I was not dissapointed by the game itself, and found myself surprised and thoroughly impressed by its Development team. I have faith that Keen Software House will not disappoint.\n\nThe game.\nThe game is in alpha as of this moment. There is no multiplayer at this time(May change in the near future). The graphics of the game leave it at a stage of simple beauty. The mechanics of the game are operational, I say operational  for there is still some fine tuning to be done however that is expected, Medieval Engineers is still in alpha stage. I personally enjoy building projects that are effected by the world surrounding it. If you enjoy minecraft, but feel a need for some realism, this game is perfect for you. There will be plenty of mods down the road, trust me. I suggest you buy the game now, enjoy it while you can, save it for later if the lack of multiplayer is a huge turn off and just keep up to date with the games progress as time passes. You can thank me later (and the Dev team. Love you guys! xD )","February 21, 2015","true","39.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

But the game is atm in a creative mode so you can freely build what you like in any way that you want.\n\nI would say that this game can go really far and it is really fun when you play with friends. But be warned the game is still in alpha/beta so there is still a ton of work that is needed but the game is worth it if you like to build and destroy stuff.","February 23, 2015","true","21.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Fully destructible structures that allow people to admire what we have been longing for for decades in the gaming industry (excluding the Red Faction series)\n\nThe construction engine in this game allows for some rather unique and powerful designs to be born from the players mind. Although rather complicated to get everything working as the construction uses a lot of different parts to come to life, once accomplished things such as trebuchet's that launch wooden poles which the player has to put in can be fired, catapult's can be made with counter-weight's, an entire village and a castle on a hill can be made, fort's with their own defences and human-activated bridges can be built to grant passage between a bridge, a gap and the fort itself, even a car can be made! But that's not counted as it's due to the player having super-human powers =T\n\nI have so far only been able to make a poopy little immobile light catapult that launches a single boulder, but I have seen people on the youtube's build catapults that fire 5 or more different boulders! Of course, without the proper craftsmanship required to build such a thing, it will break due to physics and weight affecting everything.\n\nThe destruction in this game is also astonishing! Being able to crumble structures in a way that I have never seen before really makes me want to continue playing this game. Being able to watch a humongous chunk of stone fall off the top of a tower and crumble a tichy little house beneath it just makes me want to keep replaying that moment at different angles and analyse how awesome it all looks! Of course, everything breaks at given points, but it looks so dynamic and realistic you probably won't notice that for the first hour or two of playing the game because you'll be too into destroying everything and watching how neatly everything crumbles and cracks and breaks around the point of impact!\n\nThe only current downside to the game for me is the flying. It feels too much like Space Engineers gravity-less flying and the momentum kind of gets annoying too. I personally like to fly around like in Garry's Mod, move when you want to move, stop when you want to stop. Other than that it's a very useful feature.\n\nThe graphics in this game are also really nice. They have a realistic medieval feel to them and actually look like what they are supposed to be. Stone looks like actual stone, wood looks like wood, ceramic roofs look a bit too modern, but I guess they can also be seen as Roman roofs if you would like to think of them in that way. The trees (which can also be broken and knocked over) look like really nice trees. The only thing so far that makes my computer want to go super saiyan is when the entire castle map which can be pre-loaded is destroyed and the rubble is moving. Apart from that, the game (at least on my intermediate powered PC) runs very smoothly at 40+ fps.\n\n\nSo, TL;DR?\nAmazing game, brilliant and realistic physics, awesome construction engine, runs smoothly, good graphics and has an awesome soundtrack!\n\n\n720/10\nWould definitely chuck boulders like the Hulk into castles from different angles and simulate people screaming in fear again","February 20, 2015","true","8.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That being said, the game shows great promise from the get go! I won’t lie to you there are still a lot of bugs and certain things don’t seem to work right but all in all it is very good at this stage. Although I’m really enjoying this game so far there does seem to be a lot of lag for me. Admittedly my computer isn't ''Beast'' but I can run space engineers perfectly on high/ ultra-settings. All I’m saying is maybe if you're someone that’s playing on a less powerful rig like me then maybe it might be better to wait till the game has been optimized a bit more.\n\nMy experience so far has been mixed but i have still enjoyed it therefore this review is subject to change. xD\n","February 20, 2015","true","9.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The physics are a bit jenky but what can you expect from such an early game. One other problem I have is you can't rotate certain blocks upsidedown or sideways. There is no multiplayer as of yet but as I said before it was just released.\n\n\nThe graphics are awesome and you should find no trouble running the game on medium (From my experience).\n\n\nYou can edit the terrain using a nice voxel system and even make structures with it.\n\n\nYou can build massive and beautiful structures with the even the basic blocks you have currently.\n\n\nNext I should talk about the mechanical machines side of Medieval Engineers.\n\n\nWhen searching for blocks to use you will find some mechanical bits and bobs, some of those are wheels, rope wheels, weight blocks and wooden rods (And more stuff besides). With this stuff you can build primitive vehicles, elevators, catapults and trebuchets!\n\n\nI have not tested or even looked at the AI in game yet but so far they have been a success to everyone.\n\n\nOverall I would say 8.3.2.0.7/10 if I were a critic, however I'm not one so really that personal score is irrelevant. You should decide whether or not you enjoy the game yourself and buy it :)\n\n\nThe people behind SE and now ME need to be hugged for making both games and if you enjoy this game buy Space Engineers or vice versa!\n\n\nIt's worth it.","February 24, 2015","true","24.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

By giving early access, the developers can use the feedback from players throughout development to shape the game into something much greater.\n\nKeen Software House delivers.  Based on their work with Space Engineers, the weekly patches are more than just bug fixes, but they truely bring new content.\n\nMedieval Engineers is a great idea with lots of potential.

Also, this glitch\nmakes it to where you cant type, respawn, or even move your camera.\n\n\nAnyways, im reccomending it because its early access, and the devs have not yet sorted out everything, so the cons (or atleast most of them) are acceptable, for the moment at least.","June 11, 2015","true","17.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Many features are still missing, which is okay because it is still in development, but the real issue is with the interface. It was bad in Space Engineers, but workable. In this, it just doesn't work (at least not with flying turned off.) Building up requires getting pretty creative with scaffolding type parts or jumping between blocks (don't fall off or you will be stuck trying to cobble together some type of stairway.) Once resource requirements are implemented, this is going to be a real issue.\n\nFiguring out how all the parts work together is interesting, challenging, and frankly downright frustrating sometimes, again due to the shoddy interface. The game looks beautiful at least.\n\nI would love to recommend this title as I really enjoy the idea of being able to build freely, but with the clunky interface and the current lack of working features, I just can't recommend it at this time.

Survival is unplayable at the moment, the physics are a bit buggy, playing online is buggy as all hell, and the progress is very slow. I would call it a reskin of space engineers though, I kinda like the controls on this game a bit more than space engineers, and think they could do well from some more similarities in building controls. All I ever really do is build ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥ around, I've even made a car powered by gears and the handle wheel thingy. It does need much improvement, and its demanding in pc specs for some, but I'd say for people who like building, its a good buy when on sale.","May 4","true","37.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I bought it early hoping I could support it and make it better, but it's never come even close to being a decent playable game:\n\n- Poorly optimized. Crashes often on a pretty good computer, and even when it doesn't crash it's super laggy.\n\n- Glitchy. Character often gets stuck at random spots. Even in the pre-set environments, like the pre-loaded castle, there are tons of spots where you just randomly can't move.\n\n- Interaction with objects is fairly useless. Again, even in the pre-set environments, the objects like catapults and drawbridges are purely for show.\n\n- Gravity is useless. There are no calculations for structural integrity, so you might as well play Minecraft.\n\n- Build tools are very rudimentary. Again, even Minecraft has more variety than this, and is a playable game to boot.\n\n- Graphics suck. There are no other skins or textures in the base game, much less an ability to choose between them in the same castle. Everything starts to look the same after a while.\n\n\nIf you want to design and "build" castles, just use Google Sketchup. If you want to play in a fortress of your design, play Minecraft or any of the dozens of other games out there in the same vein. This one just felt like a giant waste of time and money.","December 1, 2015","false","1.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Penney","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197967643963/","232 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe only very specific feature about this game that has/had plagued Space Engineers for a long time is the Multiplayer netcode. It's quite spastic, jittery, and can be totally out to lunch some times. If you design things by your self you have no issue, it's when you bring your pieces of work into some one elses game that these issues occur. I've read that optimization is key on their list for both games, as the code for both are very similar. Still, if you were planning on having a massive battle with a bunch of friends, you may want to hold off at the moment. But they do recognize very much that these games aren't that fun to play alone.\n\nI highly recommend this game, if you think you'd like this game, I'm almost positive you'll end up loving this game. And if it may be lacking a feature you desire, purchase it on sale and wait!\n\nWhile I haven't nearly as many hours playing this as Space Engineers, I will tell you that this a very great game if you at all enjoyed space engineers, or particularly building stuff in minecraft. The game comes in it's current state in 3 base modes; Creative, Survival, and Castle Siege.\n\nKeen Software House has done a lot in the past with space engineers to support modders and actually develope features that their player base asks for as well so you need not worry about the games turning into 'vapourware' or alike.\n\nThis game differs quite a bit from Space Engineers as you probably are assuming from the title, though core key layouts are pretty much the same between both games, so if you already have played space engineers you don't need to relearn much. They do have quite a different build system then other crafting games, and isn't exactly the most intuitive off the bat, though it doesn't take overly long to master.\n\nBesides the Voxel/Morphable terrain, the physics is probably the most impressive feature. I'm not exactly sure how it works but it seems to crack entire models pretty well, giving immediate results to specific areas of impact. You can also customize how much physics debris you want loaded/calculated per server, which is quite nice. If you have an extremely powerful processor, I'm sure you could build Minas Tirth from LOTR and bring the whole thing down starting with the base of it.\n\nThe game does also support Melee and crossbow combat, though it's very basic at the moment and mostly just contains the core mechanics of fighting, the animations and AI can be quite lacking at least in the current state of review, as well I didn't dive deep into it, but is a feature that is fairly fun.\n\nIf you see this on sale and are the 'builder' or 'creative' type, I'd just throw caution to the wind and pick this up. When I first bought Space Engineers I didn't play it for probably 2 months, then fell in love when they added minable resources and ore processing.\n\nThere's already so much garbage on steam stores already, this is one item at $10.99 will not be a future regret.","November 22, 2015","true","47.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Yup, still as awesome as it was before, it just got even better!\n\n\n.::: September Update :::.\n\nI still cant find anything i agree with in this game,i have especially enjoyed some of the little sneak previews the developers, have either intentionally left into the game for us to find, or just by accident, but from these we can see just how much detail is going to get put into the game. So far i have sumbled upon a number of unique player Skins, which include:\n\nFemale Engineer Models\nChildren Player /NPC Models\n"Old Man" Player /NPC Model\n\nAnd new forms of hostile animals to be introduced into the world including the "Medieval Wolf"\n\nIve found all of these inside the Small chest ingame while using Creative, and after every update i now lov to go and check it out incase there's something new in there which could possibly tell us whats coming next.\n\nWith previews like this it leaves the door open for more things to be created such as: Plate Armour, Chain-mail. Leather armour, Warhammers, Maces and Fails, it is essentially endless, and with the annoucement of "Brain AI" this could protentally become of the most advanced Player NPC Interaction game out there.\n\nAs for the building, its only got better and more stable as its progressed, and now through their weeks up bugfixing the game is getting even smoother, ive seen this personally with a few friends who wern't able to run the game very well before and now they can.\n\nI've even started my own projects such as building a re-creation of the Runescape World across several maps.\n\nI can only hope that one day the developers will bring out large maps one day which will allow players to build kingdoms together through continous generation.\n\n\nThis is the only review i enjoy updating if im completely honest and i will update it again in the future!","February 27, 2015","true","192.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Yup, still as awesome as it was before, it just got even better!\n\n\n.::: September Update :::.\n\nI still cant find anything i agree with in this game,i have especially enjoyed some of the little sneak previews the developers, have either intentionally left into the game for us to find, or just by accident, but from these we can see just how much detail is going to get put into the game. So far i have sumbled upon a number of unique player Skins, which include:\n\nFemale Engineer Models\nChildren Player /NPC Models\n"Old Man" Player /NPC Model\n\nAnd new forms of hostile animals to be introduced into the world including the "Medieval Wolf"\n\nIve found all of these inside the Small chest ingame while using Creative, and after every update i now lov to go and check it out incase there's something new in there which could possibly tell us whats coming next.\n\nWith previews like this it leaves the door open for more things to be created such as: Plate Armour, Chain-mail. Leather armour, Warhammers, Maces and Fails, it is essentially endless, and with the annoucement of "Brain AI" this could protentally become of the most advanced Player NPC Interaction game out there.\n\nAs for the building, its only got better and more stable as its progressed, and now through their weeks up bugfixing the game is getting even smoother, ive seen this personally with a few friends who wern't able to run the game very well before and now they can.\n\nI've even started my own projects such as building a re-creation of the Runescape World across several maps.\n\nI can only hope that one day the developers will bring out large maps one day which will allow players to build kingdoms together through continous generation.\n\n\nThis is the only review i enjoy updating if im completely honest and i will update it again in the future!","February 27, 2015","true","192.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Penney","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197967643963/","232 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe only very specific feature about this game that has/had plagued Space Engineers for a long time is the Multiplayer netcode. It's quite spastic, jittery, and can be totally out to lunch some times. If you design things by your self you have no issue, it's when you bring your pieces of work into some one elses game that these issues occur. I've read that optimization is key on their list for both games, as the code for both are very similar. Still, if you were planning on having a massive battle with a bunch of friends, you may want to hold off at the moment. But they do recognize very much that these games aren't that fun to play alone.\n\nI highly recommend this game, if you think you'd like this game, I'm almost positive you'll end up loving this game. And if it may be lacking a feature you desire, purchase it on sale and wait!\n\nWhile I haven't nearly as many hours playing this as Space Engineers, I will tell you that this a very great game if you at all enjoyed space engineers, or particularly building stuff in minecraft. The game comes in it's current state in 3 base modes; Creative, Survival, and Castle Siege.\n\nKeen Software House has done a lot in the past with space engineers to support modders and actually develope features that their player base asks for as well so you need not worry about the games turning into 'vapourware' or alike.\n\nThis game differs quite a bit from Space Engineers as you probably are assuming from the title, though core key layouts are pretty much the same between both games, so if you already have played space engineers you don't need to relearn much. They do have quite a different build system then other crafting games, and isn't exactly the most intuitive off the bat, though it doesn't take overly long to master.\n\nBesides the Voxel/Morphable terrain, the physics is probably the most impressive feature. I'm not exactly sure how it works but it seems to crack entire models pretty well, giving immediate results to specific areas of impact. You can also customize how much physics debris you want loaded/calculated per server, which is quite nice. If you have an extremely powerful processor, I'm sure you could build Minas Tirth from LOTR and bring the whole thing down starting with the base of it.\n\nThe game does also support Melee and crossbow combat, though it's very basic at the moment and mostly just contains the core mechanics of fighting, the animations and AI can be quite lacking at least in the current state of review, as well I didn't dive deep into it, but is a feature that is fairly fun.\n\nIf you see this on sale and are the 'builder' or 'creative' type, I'd just throw caution to the wind and pick this up. When I first bought Space Engineers I didn't play it for probably 2 months, then fell in love when they added minable resources and ore processing.\n\nThere's already so much garbage on steam stores already, this is one item at $10.99 will not be a future regret.","November 22, 2015","true","47.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

To be honest unless you understand how the game engine works. You will not see the hard work that has gone into creating this game. The multi-block features are amazing. If you want to get creative building of castles with realistic physics. This is the game for you. It makes you think about real world engineering problems. However the survival part of gameplay is terrible right now. The AI bots need to be done again. The interface is hard to use. I suggest you keep an eye on future up dates but right now not recommended. It is still very early in development but shows promise.

Even with this game they said the wanted more building instead of fighting, but they have recently been developing more character tools than regular blocks. The developers must keep that in mind; that the blocks are more important than the more minor things. Again, I must praise them for their structural integrity view, and the overall usage of structural integrity, plus their AI. It is amazing what they have done overall, they just need a remider of their values. Again, for the last time; amazing game, amazing details and block configurations.

I Support them fully.  I've bought 2 copies of space engineers and 4 copies of this game.\n\nWhat set's these games apart from the rest of the "early access" sandbox games, is that the engine is clearly made for real life physics demonstrations.  The developers are creating games which resemble reality.   This is not a cheaply made game.  The developers are not in this for the quick cash of releasing something "simple and playable with friends" just to get their name on twitch and youtube.\n\nHere in medieval engineers, you get to play in a sandbox, where you are limited by physics and therefore your creations will have to become methodical.  This is not a game about creating a big giant piece of art, unless that piece of art is also architecturally stable.\n\nIf you enjoy space engineers, or fantasy/medieval/feudal themed sandbox games, then this will become a great addition to your library.","May 29, 2015","true","30.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are a wide variety of things you can do while playing this game, including, but not limited to:\n\nBuilding castles and houses.\nCutting down trees.\nMining stone.\nRuling like a king.\nBeing a deer.\nWith more features coming as time passes, I can expect this game to shape up to become a new benchmark in voxel-based sandbox titles.
