SO therefore My Review is solely my choice, and NOT because of a " free key" OK. I just want to make this clear to all who read my review and rate it at will.\n\nThis game is not a game everyone will enjoy and or like SO ( game is not to everyone's liking). When I first started up this game, I was very impressed with the quality my laptop produced, this game can only run on low settings with my PC, so I was pleasantly surprised with the visuals I had experienced with in this game. MY PC did not struggle, nor did I experience any game crashing nor bugs with in this game, BUT every PC is different with different specs and so can be very possible to have issues with in a different PC, BUT I had none, just wanted to make this clear as well.\n\nAbout the game :\nI'm giving a Thumbs UP because truth be told I actually really enjoyed this game, once I got going and on the right track with in the game, and I did spend many hours playing and enjoying the visuals, all while getting my achievements.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=670512519\nFirst of all, I will be honest here, to start with I did become rather disappointed at first, as this game is rather short. So as I walked the path, I came to the end of my path where a rock formation was, and so I though this is the end, now where?. So I started to head back though the trees, zigzagging in and out as maybe I had missed something, I did become quite frustrated as there was nothing but a lot of same, same, and more of the same. So then I saw and commented on a friends review, and found out that the rock formation at the end of the path was actually a cave, so YEAH I was a bit blind here. Once I went back to my surprise that rock formation was a cave, just angled a slight bit up, so  I  miss it, with the first walk through.\n\nonce you head through that cave with out any "spoilers" you come out to another part of the island, you need to also follow that path down to a bridge and activate it, wait for the bridge then cross over. Continue on this path to the end. Anyway guys that's just the path, you still have 8 achievements to acquire along the way, they are not that hard to get, but some a little more challenging than others, and you can get all these achievements easily with out a walk through, but for me took me some time to get, or I'm just a very bad gamer :P\n\nI'll cut to the chase now :\n+ Lovely graphics and visuals, and pleasant piano tunes to listen to, also lots of nature sounds as well which are lovely to hear.\n+ Very simple basic story, BUT could have been more in depth I think !\n+ 8 Achievements for all you achievements hunters and very easy to acquire ;)\n+Once you finish the game a new game mode opens up, called Noir mode, so you can do a walk through in this mode if you desire.\n+ Game runs great with an Xbox Controller with no issues.\n\nNoir Mode screenshot:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=670602067\n\n- Game is to short with a lot of the same, same and more of the same. I would like to see more, say statues, birds sitting in trees, Rabbits hopping around, perhaps some Raindeers actually running around rather than just standing there. I can also hear the wolf every so often, but never get to see 1 ? I just feel this game has plenty room for improvement, and this would bring a greater interest to this gaming genre.\n\n- NO SAVE spots, as I believe this would be of great benefit, perhaps a halfway save, or 1 at the cave and 1 at the bridge, since I had to leave the game running on a few occasions, while halfway through. If I had stopped and closed the game, I would have had to start at the beginning again. SO yeah I have left the game in idle while away a  few times, so really I would have only put about 4 hours total, into this game myself. JUST look my hours 7 hours for a less than 1 hour game. :P\n\n- No trading Cards. But these are not so important, BUT i know people love them and enjoy crafting those badges and collecting the emoticons for their arts, as I am 1 of those people ;)\n\nAll in all, I feel the price is reasonable for what you are getting with in this game and from a lovely dedicated developer, who prides them self's in there work, BUT I do really want to see more, if that's not to much to ask. This game is lovely BUT seems very fast produced game, and could have been so much more and better. BUT I did like what I saw, and enjoyed every minute I had with this game.\n\nP.S : I really loved the snow it is so very pretty ,something we don't see here in our part of the world. Thank you greatly for this game, I truly did enjoy my time with it, and I hope anyone else contemplating getting this game will also enjoy their time with the game as well.","April 23","true","7.6"," 40 of 50 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","40","50","0","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/akatarzynak/recommended/463030/","akatarzynak","AKatarzynaK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/akatarzynak/","388 products in account","Bottle is a first person walking simulator where you follow a path in a snowy environment, enjoying the sights as you go along and occasionally finding letters that add some context to your journey. The graphics are beautiful and the environment is very bright and refreshing.  Those who enjoy taking screenshots will find many opportunities for some lovely captures in this game. The music is very calm and lovely to listen to along with the sounds of nature as you walk along. There are also achievements that are unlocked simply by playing the game, an aspect which those looking for achievements will enjoy.\n\nAfter completing the game once you may play it again, this time in Noir Mode, where the game is changed to black and white, the stars are out, and a few key things are different as you walk along the road. I enjoyed this mode very much for the change it brought to the scenery as I thought it was very lovely in a very different way than the normal mode.\n\nOne issue I had was that at times the path is not so clearly defined, so I found myself unaware if I was actually going in the right direction and even found myself lost a few times, but this isn’t such a big deal as in all cases I easily found my way to where I needed to be. I also felt that the game could have benefited from more story or some narration to help fill the gaps where there is no music. However, I did find these quieter moments to be very peaceful and introspective.\n\nI truly enjoyed this game for its beauty and simplicity. For the low price at which it is being offered I think it’s a fair amount to pay if you are a fan of walking simulators, are looking for a short but relaxing experience, or are on the prowl for achievements or screenshots. As with all walking simulators it’s not really for everyone, but if you’re a fan of this genre you should be pleased with the experience it provides.","April 30","true","1.9"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","31","37","0","1"

The game is short, so do not expect from game some kind of a massive story. The graphic is really good and i liked that the game is very bright, fresh and soothing. I liked the music too, it was really enjoyable to walk on the path and hear some sounds of nature like wind, birds, trees and water. The big plus for achievement hunters is that this game has a 7 easy achievements so you can do 100% game. I think this game could feel free to have a longer story and they should add tone of horror game. The low price is really fair to the fact, that game is just walking simulator and it is really short. I recommend this game for screenshooters because there's a lot of positions that may make seriously unique screenshots.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=691371103\n\n+ fair price\n+ relaxing music\n+ noir mode (great addition to a game)\n\n- short story\n\n\nWalk Noir\nAfter passing games you can play a new mode - walk noir. Already the name implies that it will have something to do with black or dark color. It is a new mode in which you follow the same path but the graphic is darker. If you want 100%  achievements, you have to also complete it.\n\n7/10","May 26","true","1.6"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/recommended/463030/","lillje","Lilly (✿◠‿◠)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/","2609 products in account","Bottle feels more like a bonus chapter of Drizzlepath: Genie rather than a standalone game, although playing Genie before Bottle is not at all required. For those that have previously played Genie, the setting will feel very familiar - you'll be wandering on a similar path, even with a similar cave, only this time everything is covered in snow. Although the main feelings that the game generates remain: the calm, the stillness, the introspection, meditation, relaxation, there are quite a few notable differences from Genie.\n\nIn my opinion, a strong negative aspect of Bottle is that it lacks a story or at least a narrator. If in Genie or even in the first Drizzlepath game, you were always accompanied by the narrator voice that kept up your interest through memory snippets or words that invited to meditation, in Bottle you feel all alone, lost in a cold and unfriendly world, without a beginning or an end.  The music, despite being very soothing and nice, didn't manage to fill this gap for me. I hoped to find some explanation waiting for me at the end of the journey, but this explanation never came. Therefore, I concluded that the intention of the game was only to offer a world to be explored at your own pace, without any additional symbolism. This idea was also strengthened by the fact that the world in Bottle, although much smaller than the one in Genie, provides a bit more exploration around the main path. However, even with this extra space, Genie offers much more beautiful sights on the way.\n\nThe gameplay is quite short (around 20 minutes); however, the time is doubled by the addition of a new mode - Walk Noir - which basically means journeying through the same path again, but this time with a black filter and a few changed elements that might be quite difficult to spot for some people.\n\nI would recommend Bottle to all the Drizzlepath: Genie fans out there that don't mind exploring a nice world, without being offered a story and a context. Or to all the gamers that savour a calm and nostalgic walk in the nature, on a winter day. Or to the achievement hunters that enjoy an easy and relaxing game.\n\nNote: A key has been provided by the developers with the request to write an informative review. No other consideration, compensation or instruction was received. My personal opinions about this game are not influenced by this.\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","April 25","true","5.1"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

I was a big fan of Drizzlepath, the first game by the same developer, and this one takes the formula a step further. This is a purist walking sim. The largest part of the enjoyment here is pondering the curious shining, sparkling virtual reality you are taking a walk through. Much like Drizzlepath, the few story (poetry?) fragments are incomprehensible, but serve primarily to set the mood a little. What's particularly neat with this one is that on completion you unlock a "noir" mode that renders the whole thing in grainy black-and-white and creates a completely different take on the same journey. It's very well done. If you're looking for a "game game" this is probably not for you, but if you like walking sims, this is another delightful entry in the genre.","May 22","true","1.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
