The controls are abysmal at best.  Loved the original paper based RPG, so I felt compelled to try this little strategy game which looks like a turn based X-com style game.  After reading how it is supposed to function in the in game guide, I still cannot get my soldiers to do more than walk around.  They will not target or shoot enemies.  When you attempt to select an enemy target, it does select the enemy; however, it is as if it simply jumps to an information screen about that enemy while forgetting the original player's unit who was supposed to be 'targeting' the enemy unit.  Thus no attack options pop up.  Reading some of the producer's website, it sounds as if this might have been developed as a touchscreen tablet ap game, where it may work well for all I know.  I'm not a touchscreen tablet user.  I have a PC.  I opted out of the 'new' Windows experience, not wanting a glorified tablet operating system on my PC, and I do not have a touch screen on my PC.  The game currently feels unplayable.  I may tinker with it enough to get it to 'unwieldy,' or I may just save the data space on my HDD, as I don't feel much need to trouble shoot games that are supposedly post production.\n\n\n\n[After more effort to play and to respond to some comments]:\nOh I've done both.  There is some sort of indeterminate lag on input in this game that makes no sense at all.  The UI in this game is TERRIBLE.  Appearance is fine, but over half the time it doesn't detect the presence of the cursor over a button, or, alternatively, it simply doesn't register most mouse clicks.  Since there is no UI feedback to let you know you _are_ hovering over the hotspot for a button, it's anyones guess as to which is the case.  I have finally got to see a targeting box, or I'd have deleted long ago.  A diehard Cthulu or Lovecraft fan might tolerate this game, and I don't feel cheated at the price I payed for it since I am a Lovecraftian, but most 70's Atari games had better response/detection of user input than this game does, AND IT'S NOT EVEN REAL TIME, it's a turn based strategy game.  Clicking a random number of times from 2 to 20 to get the game to acknowledge input, from character upgrade screens, dialogue screens, and combat turns doesn't make for smooth game play.  Feels like the developers were pushed to roll the product out before it was fully play tested, like most EA products are done.  Don't really expect that in indie type games.","March 6, 2014","false","15.9"," 394 of 509 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","394","509","3","6"

Which is absolutely titanic in size and im going to be comparing this Sadly but Admitably Inferior Product to. I feel like ive gotten my moneys worth in this game, i'll try the DLC another day but here is my two cents.\n\nThe people who are complaining about the game's controls in the reviews are pretty stupid, sure i found problems initally with UI where clicking anything didn't work. Restarted and worked flawlessly. Following the Tutorial, for people who don't get it. You CLICK YOUR UNIT that you want to attack with and then RIGHT CLICK on the enemy you want to attack, you can keep the Attack Tab up at the same time, so you can change weapons which is nice. You can also tilt the game environment with the arrows at the side of the screen. (You know, the ones that are sorta spinning.) Its inconveienent but its not all that bad. The funny thing is if you actually listen to the tutorial it explains it, i think the tutorial should be implimented into the campaign rather than a option of the latter as it helps alot with the UI.\n\nThe Combat for the most part is about pushing forward and keeping the team together, if you go in thinking this is like XCOM you will get thrashed by trying to camp in the later levels. The enemies will just continually respawn at certain points until you know nothing but multiple Cthuhid's (Like im telling you what THAT is!) crushing you into dust. Its barely XCOM as we know it, Overwatch is no longer a command you can initalise, instead you simply hold left over points for Overwatch and to my knowledge they do not pass over to the next turn of play. Which means you should leech every single action point out of your characters to maximise efficency. Otherwise your just going to lose it shooting a creature you don't want to shoot at, which is already in your line of sight. Some of the Enemies in the game are strictly for tanking, and they will become a serious hazard if you don't get your guys with shotguns upgraded. Melee units are literally amazing against the later Cthuhids later in the game, but look absolutely silly with a guy with a tiny shovel taking down a abberation half his size.\n\nSanity becomes a Massive issue towards the end of the game, nearly all your soldiers will go insane if you do not have either your investigators a Sanity Restoration book on them. Also max up any Sanity based ablities as they will help you later on. The enemy pacing is nice, and i like how the gameplay becomes from fighting humans to outright nightmares, especially the slow leaning on taking Sanity more seriously above Mustard Gas protection.\n\nIts enjoyable but might be frustrating for those who just aren't used to turn based strategy games. You need to plan things out for the long run, looking over the map design and finding what route is easier. I'd say Gas Masks are redundant once you've got your main soldiers kitted out and your investigators their own Gas Masks, especially towards the end of the game. Its also pretty important you build your team specifically to synergise with each other and to keep pushing forward. As long as your team compliments each other, you will always be moving forward or at least working towards a end goal.\n\nGameplay however has plenty of flaws, the Lack of a Cover System makes human combat rather awkward, moments where your not sure if a bit of a building is cover or a small cubby hole to shoot through are plenty and there are a few hinderance with UI but i found the game pretty much doesn't really have too many of them and looks simple to fix with a simple patch.\n\nThe Graphics are a major problem, i mean they look okay for the asthetic but they could defintely be more repulsive or have something more to it. I Appreciate the attempt by the developers but it is definitely not a pretty game and i feel if they put more into the actual graphics, it'd look okay. They aren't really what get in the way.\n\nThe Story isn't all that interesting but its not completely dull, often there are these particularly tense( or Annoying.) Sections where your Main Protagonist is taken into a small dream and forced to do a stand against various foreshadowing creatures. Its nice to see it and i found it short but a good way to earn some extra xp, which your going to need. The Antgonist is rather forgettable sadly, i don't really see why he has much of a story to begin with. Im much more interested into one of the investigator's Backstory.(Not going to spoil it for those who are really into this.) Im not going to spoil things but the locations are vaguely interesting, its nice to see a WW1 Scene rather than the sorts of horror locations i typically expect in games these days.\n\nThe Music and Voice Acting is next to non-existent, which for a £3 Game.. Im not complaining. I didn't expect to have that much fun with it as i did, but i was pleasantly surprised, being both a XCOM fan and a Fan of the Original works so it practically screamed BUY to me.\n\nIts £3, or $5. Seriously, i can think of ice cream more expensive than that and ive had alot more fun with this game than any amount of Ice Cream ive dared to eat.\n(Yes you can use that on the cover or Whatever.)\n\nI think with a few gameplay tweaks, a massive improvement to graphics and sound. Overall a larger and higher quality game, you have a potential competitor to XCOM with a great universe to base itself from.\n\nTL:DR?\n\nI Recommend, Lots of Fun for the strategy fan, Cheap ($5 People! 5!) and Short piece inbetween bigger titles. Needs Gameplay Overhauls and a even bigger Graphical Overhaul, with sound for a potential sequel for PC, otherwise.\n","March 6, 2014","true","7.2"," 96 of 128 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","96","128","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/251390/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Wow! So many negative reviews on that little baby! From my point, all that hatred is being misplaced, this game doesn't deserve such bad comments!\nWhat we have here is a turn-based squad tactical game, which looks like something from 20th century (Gorky 17, anyone?). Actually it is an indie game and, what's the worst, mobile port. Being a touchpad game is certainly a disadvantage for PC gamers, but Hey! There are actually many very good titles from mobile platforms! And while we obviously have some flaws with the visuals and controls, it is not the reason to take this bird down!\n\nLet me tell you about what is good with that "Call of Cthulhu".\nFor a start, we have a decent, even profound turn-based combat. And it is only getting better, when we going deeper to the darkness. While the first mission feels like a mundane work about clearing the trenches from Krauts, soon we'll be fighting the abyss monsters, and there the game shows its best piece of mechanic. See, we have a RPG elements here, and it is quite possible to make one ubersoldier who will be calling all the shots... in theory. In practice, we have a consciousness as a stat, and it depletes very quickly when fighting the monsters. You can't fight the evil and be untouchable by it, see? It is impossible to beat "Ctulhu" with a single champion. To make all this thing right, you need to keep all your squad in one solid fist, and make sure everybody is covered.\nAnother interesting thing about "Sanity" stat is that it is your mana... of kind. Closer to the end of the game, you'll get a set of grimoires to make some spells (like draining enemy's action points, or even hurt all bad things on the map). And to cast a spell - you need your "Sanity" high. I think that's a neat concept, and it's actually works!\nFinally, as of good part, this game takes place in the year of 1915, in the middle of the Great War. I think that's kind of rare topic, so that's a plus point for me. If that's not your thing, have another: there are a second campaign, where you play for bad guys, commanding monsters to eat people! How do like the Dark Side, huh?\nNo? Okay, you don't need to play for Evil to get all achievements, and to beat that game on gold, you'll gonna need less than 10 hours. Guess, that's a plus, after all.\n\nNow, about bad things and complaints for this game:\n1) While it is a mobile game, it's quite hard for casual players. Turn-based tactical games should be like that, actually, but that is hurting some weaklings nowadays. Pity on them.\n2) Controls of this game... so many complaints about them! In fact, they are not exactly of "dream-come-true" type, but I found them tolerable. Yeah, I've seen manual and tips beforehand, and played a training mission to get in tune, but after that - all were fine.\n3) Graphics, visuals - yeah, they looks not so bright. Certainly not a match for modern XCom glamour. But hey! That game was made by a team of 5 men, and it is priced less than 5$ - even without discount! The only thing I can complain is a twitching camera. You take your soldier, pointing him an enemy to be mowed down, blam! And just after the shot camera making a twitch back to your man. It is getting anxious quite fast, especially when you meet stormtroopers and other enemies who need to be shooted at more than once. You point at them, blam! And you need to point your gun again from the start, like we are playing a shooting sim, and not a turn-based strategy. But, you know what? It is a small issue. Is is not even a bug.\n4) Bugs. Many people writing about bugs, but no one cares to name them. I've not seen any bugs in the game, only spiders and tentacle monsters. But it is predictable from a game with such a name. Again, no real bugs occured (was tested on 3 PC I currently using).\n\nConclusion.\nThat game not about nice-looking, like some casual players are expecting. Even worse, it is a mobile port, so it looks clunky, and it plays a bit clunky as well. But, with its cost, we have a decent, even engaging turn-based squad tactical game, where you really have to think about next moves. And we have somewhat unique setting, of Lavcraftian stories, and Great War. The story is inferior (usual thing in the most of turn-based strategies), and mechanics is good and entertaining for the fan of such games (good mechanic is the MUST for any TBS).\n\nSo, buy it, if you are looking for a new approach in turn-based squad-based tactical games. And Avoid It, if you are familiar with this genre only via new "XCOM" title, or have a zero tolerance to old-school-styled stuff.\nMy mark is 7.5/10 - fairly acceptable. Short, but satisfying.\nPS: Thanks to Cunning Fox, who gifted it to me!","September 11, 2015","true","14.7"," 52 of 63 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","52","63","0","4"

It's a good game, but short and sweet. It has it's replay value, but for most people, once you finish it you probably won't be touching it again, save for the extra missions. As a game, it holds up well, although it's not entirely faithful to the Mythos (we all know that the invesitgators would get their s*** slapped by these things). But, relating to the Call of Cthulhu tabletop game by Chaosium? These are all characters you may very well expect to see in any other CoC tabletop campaign.\n\nI'd say that if you're looking for a quick game with some interesting survival elements and a fun battle system, pick this one up. But if you're looking for something a bit more in-depth and drawn out in your RPG strategy collection, this is a game that wont' be satisfying you any time soon.","September 24, 2014","true","9.2"," 39 of 47 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","39","47","0","0"

Lovecraft entertained us with stories of madness and the unknown back in the early 20th century. Known for his works of ‘The Shadow out of Time and ‘At the Mountains of Madness’, his other work, ‘The Call of Cthulhu’ is what this game is based on (obviously). Now a registered trademark of Chaosium Inc, this game is centred on The Call of Cthulhu RPG. Originally made for the iOS, the ported PC version is quite reasonable, despite its apparent handset limitations as there are no real extra features to take advantage of the PC. Yet it’s entertaining enough to finish due to its tactical nature.\n\nThe game itself has eleven missions and each one can take about an hour or so. Also note that even though the maps are quite small, it’s the nature of turned based combat that makes it longer. And as mentioned before, each mission will test a variety of skills therefore boredom won’t come easily. That said, because it’s a ported game, it’s a decent one at that however it could benefit more if the game has added features to compliment the PC world and not a direct copy from the mobile world, as highly evident from the user interface. But it’s certainly a decent game to play despite the lack of features that you come to expect from a good turned based game like Silent Storm, Gorky or the Jagged Alliance series. Plenty of love was poured into this game so it’s a worthwhile trip that pays respectable homage to H. P.

Would have also liked more fleshed out tutorials or explanations. Was shocked to find spell books in the shop without any reason for them being there.\n\nThat being said, it captures a decent amount of the flavor from the PnP game and provides an excellent and sometimes challenging diversion. If you are a fan of CoC and turn based games who can spare $5 - it is worth picking up. However if bugginess drives you bonkers - steer clear.","March 10, 2014","true","11.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Yes it is a mobile/tablet port, but thats not inherently a bad thing. Yes, the controls need getting used to, but some people who comment didnt actually read how this game or the controls work and just started bashing it because it doesnt work like a "standard" game. And you dont need to be Einstein to figure out the controls.. Most bugs have been fixed I think. Playing it through I had 1 crash in 18 hours.... thats less than many AAA titles and other than that no problems.. Dont believe reviews of people who played this game less than 2 hours... because there isnt much to review except you played it on easy and in that case you shouldnt complain that it is easy... Yes, the buttons dont always react the first time you click on them, but that doesnt matter too much in a turn-based game.\nIf you like the works of Lovecraft and like turn based tactical games you cant go wrong with this game at the current price.

Definately a throwback to 90's style controls. For its price its fun enough to play through. Looking at the complaints mentioned, I myself did not actually get any of the described errors, although this may be due to it already getting fixed by the time I brought the game.\nAs for the control issues mentioned, it is answered by playing the tutorial mission, as already said by previous comments.\nI do advise playing this on hard though, to get the challenge that some others are demanding. For the price paid it was able to keep me entertained to the very end, and was a fun introduction to the cthulhu mythos.\nAs for gameplay, let me say that mustard gas is a pain, one slot of inventory for each character will always be taken up by a gas mask, but it does fit with the time period the game is set, and and really shows how much gas was an ever present threat in WW1. At 'Hard' the game throws hordes at you who are supported by ranged shooters, but good positioning  and selective targeting can whittle down the undead hordes, so you can then focus fire on the damn tanks. I did not notice what others mentioned though about contstant respawning enemies. I found you could clear an area of all enemies, and unless you move on to the next event trigger, the map would stay clear. My advice, at the very beginning focus on raising individual weapon specialties of each character up to at least 65+ and train up someone on the machine gun fast. For the rest of the game focus on doubling up on essential skills, like medics, and psychiatry. Get your action points up so you can fire your shotgun wielders twice, by end game and you should be able to handle any horde at Hard. Also,characters going crazy can be just as helpful or harmful depending on whether they end up manic or paralysed, but a manic shotgun wielder is a thing of beauty... =)","March 14, 2014","true","26.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

I love Lovecraft, and I love WW1.

The interface is atrocious - even upgrading or equiping your men between missions is a pain -, and the maps are more often than not too open and too small, meaning you usually can shoot at everything right from the start.\nI'm also wondering why the developpers took two dark themes (the Great War and lovecraftian madness), yet decided to treat it lightly.

You can stand right beside someone with a medium machinegun and completely miss them.  This happens often.  There is no way to crouch or take cover, except leaping into a shell hole or trench, as all characters remain standing at all times.  The artillery call is very amusing, you launch a pidgeon and seconds later a shell lands where you called it.  This should have been delayed by several turns but resulted in a brief  barrage to even begin to approach reality.\n\nAnother annoying part was there was no easy way to see your character's experience gain until after the mission.  Equipment slots are also extremely limited.\n\nMore work, with an interface for combat more like Xenonauts (which is excellent, btw) or Far Cry, and this could have been a legendary Cthulhu title.  As it stands it comes off cheaply done and completely unrealistic.","May 17, 2014","false","7.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Keyboard does nothing, throw that ♥♥♥♥ in the garbage. Can't put it in windowed mode afaik, can't turn off the bad music without turning off sound entirely. It's like they took the mobile version and put it on PC and did nothing further to really make it into a PC game. You can't even use arrow keys to move the camera. And all the buttons are ENORMOUS, like they're made to accomodate a touch screen. But this is on PC, so that ♥♥♥♥ isn't necessary. And most of the HUGE buttons don't even seem to do anything. And a lot of the time when you click on a button you just click on the terrain behind it and waste a lot of AP and possibly lose a unit to bad controls.\n\n\nUPDATE:\nSo I gave this game another shot after I saw that they patched it last week. I'm kinda getting into it now, really. The keyboard is still largely un-used - an easy thing would be to add arrow keys or WASD for camera movement, but it's still largely played with a mouse. It feels like I'm operating a touchscreen interface with my mouse, which doesn't feel good at all on a PC game.\n\nIn short, the game is a lot better than my initial review would have you believe, but I still think it's a lazy port and I can't really recommend it.","March 6, 2014","false","13.1"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

Loading screens tend to freeze or deadlock. This wouldn't be a huge deal if it weren't for the fact that all saving is auto-save (so you can't save before you do something that you know will load a new map and therefore freeze the game). The result is an almost-unplayable mess.\n\nThe controls are sticky and unsensitive. I find myself often having to click a button 3 or 4 times for it to register. This wouldn't be a huge deal except for the fact that sometimes when you click 3 or 4 times, the 1st or 2nd click will register and the next ones will hit whatever is below.\n\nVague levels with no clear objectives (the dream levels), endlessly spawning enemies, dice roll bugs (I had an enemy that would not be hit by guns no matter the range or number of bullets fired at him).\n\nJust bugs bugs bugs! Also poor doc. I'm sure this is on the website someplace, but I really think that in the upgrade screen, hovering over abilities should probably give like a tooltip that tells what the abilities do.

Its hard depending on how you play games.\n\nNext is you need to know that your investigators are normal humans who have fear of the unknown. things that are not  human or once was human. when your sanity drops u either turn to be a rambo mode that will the next turn or will be paralized so you need careful planning w/ psychology.\n\nWargears are limited and only offers upgraded version of the weaker counterpart that earns lots of action points so you need careful planing here for better resource allocation. Armor..... honestly i played w/ just steel helmets and leather vest as standard issue w/o any problem. Magic - the stuff that works miracles BUT loses sanity. probably bring health of R'yle in one and just use med packs on the others. Just make sure you take cover as much as possible since it dictates the difference between life and death.\n\ntho i like to warn most people graphics wise its not the best in the market but it will give you a warm but Decent textures and environment. tho i see most of the time are Browns.\nthe Music is nice but not my cup of tea.\n\npros-\n>challenging - keep the advantage of positioning of troops , proper stat allocation and wargear upgrades.\n>works well in my 7 year old PC running in WinXPSP3\n>very few bugs encountered.\n>cuthulu mythos and WW1\n>Sigmund Freud (the interpretation of dreams AKA LIBIDO)\n\nCons-\n> game is very short you can finish it in 2 days once you get the hang of it and if you play 18 hrs a day you can finish it faster\n> the music (in my opinion its the stuff where denizens of the warp materializes and where daemons of the ruinous powers brings you nightmares)\n> the screen rotation may not be your friend it tends to be either viewing things from length or width.\n> hard difficulty is not really hard but just a bit slightly tweaked mobs.\n\noverall\nfor casual gammer 5/10 since they wont probably delve deep in the mechanics and will be bored out after spening the next clip of your mousser hitting the air or the dust and not your enemies\n\nfor Turn based strategy fans 8.5/10 some concept are solid and new but is hard to learn the ropes at first\n\nfor WW1 fans 7/10 as the bloody brits you only see jerries and strum troopen at first and will be flooded w/ tentacales later.\n\nfor Cuthulu and lovecraft fans 9/10 . its a gem story is solid sound is alluring (for my friend)\n\nso why do i reccomend this game.... i bought this on sale. installed and i enjoyed this. not much replay value tho after you earned all the achivement and finished all the modes.\n\nPS "the forces of good needs to win every time but the forces of darkness only needs to win but once for the sleeper to awaken and this realm will be His"\n","February 26, 2015","true","13.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's a very simple and straightforward turned-based combat game, and it's pretty good for what it is. The atmosphere is nice, the wwi meets cthulhu cult setting really works. The storyline is very simple and linear, just an excuse for you to fight some some monstrous creatures, but it provided a quite enjoyable ride.\n\nSome characters are likable, despite the brief dialogues and limited interaction, and some are kind of cartoonish and silly, like the freudian jewess who joins the party at some point. The extra missions where you get to play the villain, Docktor [sic] Kaul, were the high point for me. The way the game ends as well as the way the extra missions are suddenly over is kind of anticlimatic, and I was bummed when it was over, I would have enjoyed more missions or a mission editor.\n\nI didn't have any problems with the game crashing or anything like that, it runned smooth for the 20 or so hours I played it. The controls might seem weird at first, but once you get hold of them they make perfect sense. The graphics aren't anything special, but they work very well, I like the general atmosphere created by the visuals and sounds.\n\nIf you don't hold delusional expectations, this can be a very fun and worthwhile game.","February 25","true","21.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Start up the game and you are given a splash screen to choose your resolution and language. Fine. No problem. Except that it never remembers your choice and constantly forces you to pick a resolution at startup because it always defaults to 1400x1050. Not a big deal, I could live with that but...\n\nThe controls are god-awful. You can tell it's a mobile port with zero optimiztion for PC. Want to see the battlefield from a different angle? Click the massive right or left arrow buttons at the bottom of the screen. Wanna scroll around the battlefield. Hold left-click and drag. Seriously? If I wanted to put up with this junk clunk I would have bought it for my phone.\n\nOnce you start playing the game you are thrown into a battle, but you aren't told how to finish it. I assumed killing off all the enemies was sufficient, but the mission didn't end, and I was running out of turns before my fallen comrade died. I'm assuming you have to land all your characters in those little red boxes, but it doesn't tell you that and, quite frankly, by that point I had already been so annoyed by everything is this travesty of a game, that I didn't even bother to find out.\n\nThe graphics are ♥♥♥♥, the sound is awful. The intro song tries to be spooky and atmospherics but comes off just sounding like badly-produced pop music.\n\nI've been disappointed by games before, and that can be a very subjective experience, so I tend to think that it's me and not the game. That the game might have some redeeming qualities that I just can't see myself. So I don't typically write reviews. With Call of Cthulu: The Wated Land, though, there is no redeeming quality. There is absolutely nothing here to like, unless perhaps you are completely new to PC gaming, and have zero clue, but seem remember liking it on your iCrap because it gave you something to do with your fingers on the commute to work.","April 6, 2014","false","0.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","4"

Honestly if Lovecraft meets the trenches of World War I doesn't get you excited, then I don't know what will. The gameplay is a great example of the Classic Xcom tactical style (if a little simplified). It even lets you speed up the attack and movement animations which is great.\n\nMy biggest gripe is with the interace and controls of the game. It suffers from the infamous phone port symptom of having EVERYTHING done through the left click. This makes sense for phones, but it is mildly infuriating when playing on PC. There really should be keybinds for things like: cycling through enemies in the selected character's range, cycling through your characters, toggling between snap and aimed shot, switching between your equipped weapons and items, using the selected item, etc. I've never written a game before, so I don't know how difficult it is to implement these kinds of things. But I really think they are just a mandatory addition when you are developing for PC.\n\nIf you can get past the obviously touch screen dependent interface, the game has a lot to offer if you are a fan of either xcom style tactical gameplay, or the cosmic horror theme.","May 30, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All I can figure it the game must have been patched since its release, or just don't know how to set their resolution.\n\nAll in all, Call of C'thul'hu: The Wasted Land is a delightfully fun little turn-based tactical squad game that has you leading your team of heavily armed investigators through the crater and poison-gas strewn hellscape of WW1 to stop a cult from using the fields of the dead to create their own army and literal hellscape.\n\nThe plot and gameplay refreshingly straightforward. Use XP and money earned every stage to upgrade your investigators and fight your way to the end and kill a big bad to death without losing too many redshirts along the way.\n\nThe challenge might seem a bit light to some, as I've never been able to beat X-Com but was able to beat this on normal while losing only a single redshirt along the way.\n\nThe campaign isn't very long, maybe 8-9 hours to beat, but it can be easily enjoyed in bite-size pieces (much like your investigators) and for $5 you're probably not going to do much better.","April 27","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
