After putting a considerable amount of time into it, my character had vanished. I contacted Trion support and there was nothing they could do to help me. They insisted they do not save characters on their servers. Which is something I must ask why an MMO does not save character data on the servers.\n\nI stopped playing and I moved on. I migrated to PC a few years later and one day decided to pick up defiance again. As you see, I have 160 hours in the game on steam at the time of writing this review. I bought the game long before it went F2P, I also bought one of the DLC expansions. In total I paid the full $60 release price on Xbox, $20 for a steam copy, and $15 for the Expansion that I bought.\n\nThe rest of the review will show how little their support cares about the customers.\n\nJust today, the day of this review, I recieved a notice that I was banned from Defiance. No notice as to why, just a notice telling me I've been banned.\n\nSo I emailed the support team, asking why I've been banned. They replied with an automated cut and paste statement telling me I've been banned for breaking the terms of service agreement. Still no mention of an actual reason as to why I was banned. Breaking the terms of service is too vague for anyone to understand what went wrong.\n\nI reached out this time to an email I recieved on the Defiance forums, which is specifically for people who have been banned and would like to discuss it.\n(I would like to make a note that in the email with the previously mentioned support team, or in the Defiance launcher, it would be nice to be directed to the ban appeal email address, but both failed to mention it)\nI emailed this appeal address and the only reply I got was exactly this,\n\n"After reviewing pertinent logs, we have determined that the action taken against your account was correct. We will not be reversing relevant suspensions and/or notes applied to your account."\n\nWhat exactly are these pertinent logs? Logs of what. What was done on my account to cause this ban? This is still a question I have not gotten answered. They refuse to tell me what went wrong and keep replying with vague answers, which leads me to believe they have no real reason for banning me. Only some far cry of a suspicion.\n\nI rarely speak in the chat box unless someone is trying to speak to me. So it cant be something I said.\nI do not cheat, I don't see a point in this game, especially since it's mostly a PVE game, PVP is nearly dead.\nI do not use a bot, because that's pointless and literally defeats the purpose of playing the game in the first place.\n\nIn the end I do not recommend this as Trion has shown me that the customer isn't very important to them, and they aren't willing to do what it takes to keep their players happy, especially considering the fact that Defiance is one of their many games that have a very small and decaying playerbase. They never upgrade the servers despite numerous complaints of serious connectivity issues both durring peak hours and low time as well. All they want it to pocket your money and run. As seen by the fact that they keep pumping out low quality MMOs with a sea of microtransactions. Hoping to milk one game as hard as they can and push out another game that's going to be dead on arrival.\n\nThey danced around my questions and showed no interest in giving me any substantial details on why I was banned. Furthermore they don't listen to the biggest plea from the community. Fix the connectivity issues.\n\nAlthough it is free, I do recommend staying away from this game.","February 16","false","186.8"," 326 of 367 people (89%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","89","326","367","18","11"

Here's my longest review ever.\n\nFirst, a description. Defiance is an MMO with a strong single-player plot to get you through quite a few hours. The story is interesting enough and the voice acting is great! This plot acts as an extended introduction to the game world. After that, you will need to find various public happenings (seiges, arkfalls, etc.) in which to help and compete with other players. There are also instances that spawn self-contained worlds. Some of these are PvP, others are cooperative. You also have daily and weekly missions to fulfill. All in all, similar to other MMOs. You get a cool game world and then comes the endless grind.\n\nThe game is very much a glass half-full thing. First, I love the look, which is post-apocalyptic without being too dark and beige. Enemies are varied and interesting. But over the long haul you get used to them. No further mobs have been introduced. (Not strictly the case, but they are variations on the tried and true.)\n\nYour own character is rendered nicely and you can dress up in different outfits, if that's your thing. Though this consists only of changing two articles of clothing. You start the game by choosing one of four classes and one of four main EGO powers, which becomes your special ability. Over time you fill out other passives, actives, and gain all four EGO powers. Then you are just the same as everyone else. Yep, everyone has the same attributes! The classes don't matter either, and races are purely cosmetic... and look similar enough. As do (most) of the costumes. You can spend real cash on stuff that is just a different colour from what you already have. Ho hum.\n\nThe gunplay is very good. In fact, though I haven't played them all, combat in Defiance is the best of all MMOs. Though it is third-person, it has the feeling of a FPS, which I love. You can get and modify different guns as you go on, though to a large extent there is not much difference between these either. Until you get to end-game, when you can no longer level (increase EGO), the most important thing is the EGO of your gun. Even 100 EGO matters and that's over a scale of 6000.\n\nThe game is free to play, though you will need to spend money. First, buy all the DLC by way of the Season's Pass. Really, once you discover you actually do want to play, just buy this, or you will be restricted in several annoying ways. Besides, then you get to use swords! (Not an optimal strategy and kind of orphaned, but fun anyway.)\n\nSecond, you will need more inventory slots, a lot more. Third, you will need more key capacity, or you will not be able to unlock the better random gear boxes. Overall, however, you won't need to spend too much.\n\nSeveral things in Defiance completely suck, the main one being that the number of sucky things has been steadily increasing. So what was a decent and fun game when I started is being squeezed out of existence by Trion. To the point that I will NEVER buy another one of their games.\n\nOK, let me list the sucky things.\n\nAs mentioned, classes and races DO NOT MATTER. This is not an RPG at all. Which is a wasted opportunity.\n\nSwords don't matter, they are just fun for a while. Vehicles don't really matter, since they are almost all the same. A lot of guns, likewise.\n\nCertain in-game currencies that you can get free by playing are practically useless -- you will soon have millions of clams you cannot use on anything. However, the one useful currency, used to upgrade guns (arkforge) has become rare as hen's teeth, almost impossible to grind, so you need to buy it with cash money. At insanely exhorbitant rates. Or not get cool upgraded guns.\n\nA new fun and highly challenging end-game mode called Expeditions was recently added. But to play you need to spend a brand new currency that you get only in trickles and cannot earn. So you must buy these Hunter Requisitions with cash money. Or not play. It seems that Trion is now gradually introducing features people have asked for for years, like private instances. But you must spend HR to play these!\n\nPvP sucks and is highly biased towards the higher tier players. But it is a REQUIREMENT to play PvP to build your character to the maximum cap. Some of the other necessary achievements are worse than grinding, since they rely on luck repeated over and over. Or stupid actions no-one would ever want to do. Duels. Turret kills. Driving a big truck. Say no more.\n\nDoing well in an event and getting high on the leaderboard gets you nothing. Loot is not tied to doing well. Someone might spend 15 minutes grinding and get crap, while someone else who camps and shoots a mob ONCE will get a legendary. I have no idea who thought that was a good idea, but it is an integral part of the game. Really, Defiance is one big gamble and does not reward intelligence or skill.\n\nAnd now we have a new rarity (Supreme) that guns can be upgraded to.... by gambling on success, paying arkforge, bought with real money. Unbelievable.\n\nDefiance could have been so much more. It could have been Godlike!! But stupid punitive decisions on the part of Trion have ruined it. Nonetheless, it's still the MMO with the best combat system, so I play it.\n\nIt's a shame that someone else can't take the exact same engine and build a good game on it.","January 3","true","955.8"," 302 of 351 people (86%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","86","302","351","32","12"

It's still a solid game and you will most likely enjoy it for what it is.\nDon't worry about the DLC packs right away.\nIt also uses Rifts F2P model where all major content updates (from here on out) doesn't cost anything, and the store is more vanity/utility. The first seasons DLC still costs money though.\nIt's not the best looking PC game though. Runs easily though because of that.\n\n\nWhile I experienced bugs at the start, I rarely come across them now.\nSince the game has come back on Steam as F2P, the servers have basically blown up. I have constant connection issues, but the game is free so still try it out. lol\nThe connection issues may anger some people though.\n\n\nIn terms of graphics, it's fine. Clearly the fact that it was also made for incredibly outdated hardware on the consoles PS3 and 360 didn't help at all.\nIt seems up in the air if the PC version will ever get a graphical upgrade, even just HD textures, so don't expect a pretty game by today's standards.\nSweetFX helps a lot.\n\n\nFor gameplay I think it's actually really good.\nLooking at PvE it reminds me of Tabula Rasa which I miss SO much, and other third person MMOs like Global Agenda, there hasn't really been an MMO third person shooter with a big persistent world like this since Tabula Rasa.\nGames like Destiny, Borderlands and others don't have that. So if you like overworlds, that's a plus on this game vs the others.\nThis being pretty much the only one out like that, if you liked the two MMOs I mentioned, you'll like this.\nIt's also similar to Borderlands in terms of getting a constant stream of weapons and how the shooting mechanics work, but Borderlands isn't really an MMO so the similarities end there.\n\n\nThe tie-in with the show is superficial at best right now. Season 2 seems to be the same as well, though the new Silicon Valley content links storyline, oddly enough, from the defiancefew.com website\n\n\nThe shooting mechanics are good, the powers are good, though more variety of abilities would be nice in the future.\nYou gain "levels" by increasing your EGO rating through achievement-like objectives and just getting "levels". Due to DLC5 making weapon damage scale to EGO rating now, it's a lot more traditional than it was. However, you can still do all content regardless of EGO rated, and you do get boosted if the difficulty level is higher than you can naturally handle.\nThere is a decent variety of things to do now, with arkfalls, sieges, side quests, story quests, and emergencies.\nThe driving is fun. Just going around the world jumping around on your vehicle, running over enemies can be enjoyable. I really hate the races though, the mechanics are horrible when confined in races.\nI think the storyline is good, not great, though the cliffhanger is a bit lame.\n\nThe games chat works more or less like a traditional chat in an MMO now.\nHowever, this game also has a pathetically low amount of social interaction compared to other MMOs.\nNo AH or mail system either.\n\nFor PvP howerver, I would look elsewhere.\nIt's been my stance that any MMO with a PvE overworld and instanced PvP will just never have good PvP. It's impossible to balance, and never will be.\nIf they had just stuck with Shadow Wars (which is fun) and open world PvP, it would've been a lot better, but since it has instanced PvP, there's better games. TF2 is one I can think of off the top of my head and it's free.\n\nThere is an in-game shop. Most of the stuff is vanity. Overpriced vanity at that.\nAlso in the shop is lock-boxes that can get you weapons and mods, but you don't really need to buy them with cash (they are REALLY overpriced anyways, like $5 a box).\nYou can also get most of the lockboxes in-game with the games currency.\nThere's bag space, I suppose that might be needed for some, but it's not pay to win.\n\nHowever I think the biggest selling point is it's F2P. It's hard not to recommend at least trying it at that price. Especially with no monthly fee and nothing from the overpriced in-game shop item being "necessary", you can definitely get your moneys worth, and it's also easy to go back to if you stop playing for a long period of time.\nI can't really recommend the DLC Season Pass (unless it's on sale for $20, then get it) or packs though, unless you really enjoy the game and want to throw a bit more money at the developer.\nNot because I think the DLC is bad per say, but that I'm not a fan of the season pass system in this industry.\n\n\nDLC1 Review: DLC1 includes a small quest chain and 5 arenas, in which you go instead and basically just shoot a bunch of mobs for gear and rep.\nThe reputation vendors sells a series of "charge" weapons, which are weapons you hold the shot button to charge up, and an energy sword which are basically lightsabers.\nYou can also co-op the arenas now, so if you like doing instances with friends, it might be worth it.\n\n\nDLC2 Review: is far superior to DLC1. The arkbreaks you can call down are pretty fun to do, and there's always people doing them (though recently, it's died down a little due to loot reward issues).\nEven if you don't own the DLC, which would prohibit you from using the new weapons, it's still a good update.\n\nYou also get daily/weekly rewards which includes money, resources and a "battery" that you use to call down the arkbreak arkfalls.\nThere's also a small quest chain that explains the new stims and boost systems, as well as a small story quest that gets into the arkbreak system.\nIt also lets you equip all the new weapons that drop within arkbreaks. Non-DLC owners can't use them.\nI'd say DLC2 is worth buying.\n\n\nDLC3 Review: Pass.\nWhat you receive for owning this is a samurai outfit, two new blue weapons (a sniper and shotgun) and a title.\nYou also get access to a new vendor and daily/weekly contracts for a new faction.\nThat's it. There's no quests and everything else with the update you can get for free.\nIt's the worst DLC of the five, so you really aren't missing much if you don't get it.\nThe incursion event weapons are tied to this DLC FYI.\n\n\nDLC4: I think it was pretty good. There's no new faction but a new lockbox tied to an already existing reputation.\nThere's a bunch of new story missions which I find good enough, considering how starved this game is for new story.\nThere's 9 new arenas, which can be done co-op, which are okay. I can see them being fun, but I personally don't care for them\nOwning the DLC gets you access to the new quests, one of the new lockboxes and a title. I think this is slightly better than DLC2, so it is the best so far.\n\n\nDLC5: Get it if you want some Arkforge for altering gear. You get 1k and some other stuff, so worth it if you want that.\n\n\nWith the F2P transition, some of the new TV/Game tie-in missions have had the voice actors for the some of the NPCs change. It's by no means horrible, but you will notice and it is pretty jarring, though the updates are free so I can't complain that much.\n\nIn terms of how the store works, it's basically the same as it was when it was B2P. The game takes Rifts model as opposed to say LOTRO or Secret World where content updates cost money. All Defiance content updates will be free.\nThere is, what I find funny, a "subscription" option now in the shop. Which gives you various passive boosts to things like XP/Skill etc, as well as a 10% discount in the store.\nI find it funny because the game was B2P with no sub option prior to F2P. It's the first F2P transition I'm aware of where a sub option gets added to the game.\nIs the patron status worth it? That's up to you. Like Rift, it's nice but nowhere near being a "necessity"","November 25, 2013","true","024.5"," 622 of 784 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","622","784","0","15"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Laisaniah/recommended/224600/","Laisaniah","Fruitbowl M.D.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Laisaniah/","154 products in account","It’s with a sad heart that I have to say this, but Defiance is slowly becoming a husk of it's former self. The game shows great potential and holds on to it for quite some time, but the final area and it's related missions seem to come across as a charred end, leaving a sour aftertaste. And while the end-game (Arkfalls and Sieges) does provide some moderate fun, the DLC remains a disappointment. In fact, I'll do you one worse, the Incursions event that came with the 7th Legion DLC actively bugs out Arkfalls, crippling both it and itself.\nThere are goods and bads, but I figure I'll narrate them Chronologically.\n\nOn a technical level,  Defiance does bring a few interesting things to the table. To put it bluntly, you can get a Borderlands vibe when relating to weapons and related ordinance. I do mean the first  Borderlands though, as the second one has a much wider and insaner variety of weaponry with far-reaching and different effects and methods. Defiance's guns tend to stick somewhat close to their Archetype, even between brands.\n\nGun 'brands' generally differ in how the gun fires in a typical fashion. One does full automatic, some burst, some semi.\nYou have the odd-one out, such as LMG's of one brand becoming an energy bolt launcher, and some shotguns double as spamming versions of Grenade launchers. The variety is interesting, but nothing that goes 'outside the box'.\n\nShields are your typical run of the mill type with exchanged stats between size, recharge delay, recharge speed and the occasional situational buff.\n\nBut what really stands out is how the level of these items is less significant than their rarity. Again, comparing to Borderlands, guns would become nigh-on useless if they were underleveled by 10 or 20 levels, unless they were exceptionally good.\n\nIn Defiance, all the stats of the guns remain the same. Instead, with every grade of rarity, a random bonus gets applied. And with levelling comes increased chances of item rarity, as well as the more interesting brands. The early (Orange colored) Legendaries are often less interesting or bland guns.\nThis keeps a level of equality amongst all the levels of players, allowing for a somewhat balanced PvP system. Progress and effort give you an edge, but not a great advantage.\n\nOn top of that, you also have your EGO device, which you can use to make use of one of four ‘skills’ at a time. They are Decoy, Overcharge, Cloak and Blur and are very much doing what their name suggests. Accompanying it is an EGO grid of passive skills that either tie in with the skills or another context, such as getting hit or killing under a certain condition. While they are moderately interesting, there are no passives that truly stand out as ultimately useful or powerful. In fact, I would say they feel very underpowered.\n\nStorywise, it starts out cheeky and a little cliche, maybe even cheesy. But it remains bearable and even funny at times. The voice-in-your-head EGO device acts quirky and in general seems to be your spokesperson (your character plays the mute act) and moral guidance.\n\nAnd yes, the latter does imply that your character rarely seems to give the impression he/she has a mind of their own. Simply following orders whenever given, by anyone relevant.\nBut the story starts to truly derail when you arrive in the final area and separated island called San Francisco. I say this to many people: Defiance is a great game until you get to San Fran.\n\nThere is where things turn for the worst. The frontier before looks luscious and vibrant with all sorts of strange plants adorning the scenery. But in the final area, the ground is scorched and bland. On top of that, the side missions get even more befitting of a stupid henchman that the cutscenes imply only too much, being given in general by the single-most uninteresting character the game could provide: Eren Niden. Her same-tone voice and apathic nature really makes you feel like you’re the lackey providing the footwork for way more important people.\nThe only upside, the Minigun challenge takes place there, which has you mowing down hundreds of Dark Matter. (which also happens to be the most uninteresting and annoying enemy faction you can imagine)\n\nChronologically, this means the DLC ‘comes after’. And it does start out promising.\n\nThe Castithan pack comes with five arena’s holding the same enemies you’ve been blowing up the entire time, with a narration that would have been acceptable without the intercom-echo effect it has while responding to your performance. The ultimate reward is access to laser swords, which in practical gameplay has too many drawbacks to be relevant/useful unless you dedicate a whole build to it.\nWhile I have certainly had better DLC, this pack does provide everything it promised.\n\nThe second DLC, Arkbreaker, shows the descent of quality. People with the DLC can call down their own personal Arkfall and conquer it for new weaponry that functions quite different than the ones otherwise available. However, major arkfalls come with a Warmaster that requires defeating. And this is where it gets a little iffy.\n\nThe Warmaster is nigh impossible to defeat (you are only given 6 minutes and it’s really a true bullet sponge) and requires either a big dedicated Guild to join in or a group of people with perfectly worked out DPS to defeat it.\nUnlike anything else in the game, this particular boss does not scale with the amount of present players, and has taken the wrong side of the spectrum in terms of compensating for this.\n\nDespite that, it looked new and was at least a little bit interesting. But the latest DLC, the 7th Legion...\nSo far, 10 euro’s had yielded some content that was fun for at least a little bit. Even in it’s improper state, it was a new situation that was fun to adapt to.\n\nThe 7th Legion DLC however brings no new content. Incursions are a series of random mini events you normally run into while driving by, put in a series dedicated to one specific enemy, and ends in a typical Siege of which you’ve done a thousand. In fact, they take place in the very location the regular sieges take place.\n\nThe ‘new’ guns are simply reskins of the old ones with slightly improved stats, such as reload speed or clip size, with two new armors that has several versions with changed colors, and a hat. In fact, the ‘katana’ functions and even sounds the same as the Castithan Pack laser sword (humm included) but with there being no Legendary rarity available. So they’re inferior in power from the get-go.\n\nAs said, the Incursions themselves are bugged, often overlapping with an Arkfall, causing it to cripple both until either time out (and in general these random events have 20-30 minute timers) so you can imagine seeing a server full of annoyed people.\n\nNow imagine you having to do at least 10 of these, in order to get enough ‘7th Legion reputation credits’ in order to purchase the cheapest item found in their vendor, which is a mod pack that synergises only with it’s own useless effect. To get outfits, you’ll have to grind 20 of these for the Loot Chest and hope to your Gods that it will randomly include the items that you want.\n\nAnd that’s it. There’s no new story, nothing truly new, even the new meshes used for this update are anything but impressive.\n\nSo, if the DLC is anything to go by, Defiance is heading in the wrong direction. The 7th Legion is a shameless cash-in and I really wonder if it has anything to do with the fact that the confirmation of Season 2 is still up in the air.\n\nIn conclusion: This game is dying a slow and painful death. It will take all the money it can get before several internet media will officially declare this game dead.\n\nBuy it for the price of a subway sandwich, or not at all. And forget about the DLC, even the Season Pass.\n\nBottom note:\nMany still recommend this game. But compare their Game time with mine.\nI've turned this puppy inside out. You make the call.","February 16, 2014","false","265.2"," 951 of 1,230 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","951","1","0","29"

Eventually it just wore me down with repetitive, uninteresting quests that dragged out way too long.\n\nIt just doesn't know when to stop spawning in yet another wave of identical trash mobs for the quests. I could maybe live with killing a couple waves of baddies, maybe disable a couple turrets, maybe another few baddies show up, and that was that. But no. The game won't be satisfied until you've killed 100 or 200 identical raiders or hellbugs for that one quest.\n\nI just don't feel like some badass space cowboy Ark Hunter.. I feel like an overworked janitor being told yet another kid puked in the halls and I have to go clean it up.\n\nI suppose some of these quests are meant to be approached as a world co-op event, but it doesn't account for there only being one player in the area. It just keeps throwing trash mobs at you. And given that as I write this there are only 574 players in-game, you might want to get used to being one of the (very) few players around.\n\nAlso I just tried playing it again today to decide whether I'd keep it installed on my library or not, and I was having absolutely horrible texture pop in issues, or it might be more accurate to say whole-buildings-right-next-to-me pop in issues. Massive objects in the world would just flicker in-and-out of existance. (Running on a GTX 970)\n\nAnd I was just asked to kill a few too many of the Infinite Raider Clone Army. So my final verdict is that no, I will not be keeping this game installed. Here's to 15GB of free space in my hard drive.\n\nAs to whether I would recommend it? Well.. the game is free, and it did kill a few hours for me. So it's hard to say no, although I don't really think it's a particularly good game. If you've got nothing better to do and don't mind a decently large download.. check it out I guess. But tbh you can probably find something better.

This game opened me up to Third Person shooters and now I'm always looking for the next one to check out.  The open world may not be as big as some traditional MMO's but it's pretty huge and there is a LOT to do.  It looks great, the combat feels solid, and the variety of weapon choices make it easy to jump in and start playing.\n\nOne issue that I've had with this game are the balance between vastly different leveled players fighting in close proximity, they have a system to balance things out, but it never seemed to work too well, leaving the lower level player (who may be in the middle of a story mission) running for his/her life instead of fighting on a level playing field.\n\nThe other issue is endgame content.  The game truly is classless, the class you choose lasts you a good hour at most, then everyone can do everything as they level, but once you max out your skill grid and finish the majority of your persuits, there's not much else to do.  There's really only one tough endgame boss, the Volge Warmaster, and the developers have such a problem figuring out how hard he should be programmed to be that sometimes he's almost completely unkillable, sometimes he's a joke.\n\nComplaints aside, I enjoyed the story.  I enjoy the combat and the ability to just run out there and kill things.  The random events that pop up on the map and the co-op missions are fun enough to keep you playing...

There are broken promises abound, incredibly poor quality updates, and a fundamental lack of understanding at both developer and management level about the game. Between cheating in PvP not being addressed, the shallow content updates, delayed update schedule, and fumblings of even the most basic systems... the game just does not have much going for it.\n\nI have hundreds of hours logged into the game because of the old PvP community that has since disappeared. The final straw for me was when 100% damage mitigation was declared a legitimate tactic by the development team, even though it was abusing a very obscure game bug to achieve it.\n\nSome other issues with the game, as I perceive them:\n\nPvE Content: Overall you are looking at maybe 10-20 hours of story quests, maybe 5-10 hours of races and challenges, and perhaps 5-10 hours of instances.\n\n* The main story isn't too bad - mostly your standard MMOG quests. There's some interesting ones here and there, but overall it's an average experience. The final boss fight was actually mildly engaging, but that's probably the only difficulty people will ever face with the game.\n* Instanced dungeons were fun, but the game encourages repetitious grinding of them. This leads to the limited amount of them becoming stale in short order.\n* Challenges can be fun, they're probably one of the more enjoyable pieces of content in the game.\n\nPvP Content: Used to be okay, now completely intolerable. Due to a damage resistance bug, specific players have an unfair advantage the developers have said they are unwilling to stop. Therefore, players are not on even footing.\n\n* PvP queues were altered to allow Shadow Wars ("open world" PvP) to start faster. This had the consequence of making the instanced PvP maps completely dead, they do not start anymore.\n* Shadow Wars take place in the open world, which was not designed for PvP. There's a serious lack of cover, dull terrain and paths, poor objective spacing, and are just overwhelmingly disappointing.\n* The first DLC update came with a new PvP map, which has serious graphical glitches (lighting breaks and makes your screen black), invisible walls that look passable, and a few other issues. Since that map never has enough people in queue, it was never fixed.\n\nUpdates: Overall very slow to come out due to console restrictions, and sparse on fixes or changes. DLC is slow, vaguely outlined, and often fails to deliver your money's worth in content.\n\n* The "Season Pass" was supposed to be a one-year, 5 DLC package. As of the time of this review (November 25), only one has been released since April. There is no way all five will come out in a year's time.\n* The only DLC released was abysmally poor in both quality and quantity. The paid update was supposed to be a multiplayer horde-style arena, but was turned into a 5-wave single player instance. The leaderboards are bugged and constantly reset, making competition pointless. A truck with a mounted turret was scrapped due to technical limitations.\n* There's a fundamental lack of understanding of how the game works at the developer level. Patches often come in that do not address player concerns, but do the complete opposite of what is requested.\n* Weapons like the FRC SAW were nerfed due to AI not pressuring players enough, making them the leading weapon for PvE content completion. They were marginal in PvP, and became useless post-patch.\n\nVerdict: The game has a great third person shooter mechanics, and that's about all it has going for it. Content is sparse and shallow, with updates not adding enough to sustain interest. Developers seem disinterested and not engaged with what the community wants, which leads to very poor content updates. The PvP is no longer competitive, due to the bugs being abused and general lack of care on the studio's part.\n\nI would not recommend purchasing Defiance. If you do decide to buy it against this advice, then I would highly recommend avoiding the Season Pass.\n\nIf you have any questions about my experience with the game, my review, or anything related, please feel free to leave a comment. I'm happy to discuss anything at all.","November 25, 2013","false","799.4"," 983 of 1,359 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","983","1","0","55"

I can't give a thumbs up to anything that does this. The DLC adds very little in the way of story as well. Also, get ready for long drawn out periods where you don't get access to your controls due to knock back and stun attacks. I don't know if that is as annoying to you as it is me, but there will be many, many cheap deaths. I have to say I really like it in a lot of ways, thus all the hours played but everything is crazy expensive and certain aspects are just completely intolerable. It's worth a try, but don't buy the DLC right away because you might find that there isn't anything in it worthwhile like I did. In short, it is okay but it has a lot of bugs that need to be smoothed out and it isn't for everybody.","April 25, 2015","false","718.4"," 212 of 271 people (78%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","78","212","271","24","1"

"Hey, that place looks shiny and neat!  Looks fun, we should visit!"\n\nThen you buy your tickets, take the flight and arrive.  You wander gawking at everything with wide innocent eyes, having zero clue what the hell is going on, but man it looks cool!\n\nAfter a while, you get tired of sightseeing, so you suck it up and decide to dip your toe into the pool, test the waters.  You grab what looks like a quest, studying the map for a minute, make a vague guess as to where you're supposed to go.  You hope on your rented ATV and head out across the country side.\n\nAs you're riding, you run into what you think are locals.  They're mean and grumpy; they call you names and are zero help.\n\nYou put up with the angry locals for a day or two as you try and find your way around.  Eventually, you *think* you have a general idea of how the quest system works; you how know how to get to one or two key locations in town.  You know how to avoid the dangerous locals; you stick to the mildly annoying ones.  How you're having some fun getting into minor fire fights, picking up bits and pieces of armor and weapons as souvenirs.  You're amused, you're satisfied.\n\nNext thing you know, a week has passed.  You're bored with going back and forth to town and the sections you're familiar with.  Branching out to new areas feels like too much work.  It's been a week; you've had your fun.  Vacations over, time to go home.\n\nYou uninstall, move on to the next game and tell your friends, "eh, that games was all right for $5", and now you feel more connected to Julie Benz every week when you watch the show because "You've been there".\n\nAnd that's all right!\n","June 26, 2014","true","4.6"," 477 of 671 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","477","671","2","14"

I was in the first beta, played literally the entire weekend start to finish and eventually got an Alpha invite. To this day I can still play on the Alpha servers if I so choose because they left them up for DLC testing. It was awesome for TRION to allow that deep community interaction because it helped me feel like I was a part of the growing process for the game. I watched and played as it grew and it was growing into something amazing.\n\nThe game hit and I no-lifed the hell out of it. Drilling through all side-quests, main missions and getting some of the best gear. I dropped $180+ on this game because I saw how awesome it was becoming. I finished the story and just sat there like oh... What next? I tried the PvP and that was fun to an extent. A little different than Alpha but still very much the same. I ran around doing ArkFalls and as many side-quests as I could. Still not much to enjoy. By the end of the first season of the show, I had totally forgot about the IP. I stopped playing and stopped caring.\n\nI see an ad for Defiance a year later talking about the show coming back for season 2. I was like hey I wonder what the game looks like now with all the DLC. I join in and I'm granted a ♥♥♥♥♥on of bonus items. Like cool, sweet, what about missions? I get a couple mission objectives and I play through some all to find it's just complete rehashings of ♥♥♥♥ I played a year ago. There's almost nobody around to play with and ArkFalls are incredibly boring and repetetive.\n\nAt this point, this game is nothing I can reccomend. I mean sure, jump in for a bit if you know nothing about the series and play for a solid 10 hours and you'll have a blast I'm sure. But once you get about half-way through, everything becomes so bland and nothing starts to feel fun anymore. I'm surprised this game is even getting support really. Just, if you want to, download the client and run around for a bit. Just don't buy anything for it at all.

You can of course buy arkforge from the shop though..... (which is really expensive IMHO)\n\nAnother side note which is purely something that irked me, the time trials are required for advancing to the top levels, if you are not REALLY good at racing games, then you will not get a lot of pursuit points due to the requirements in the persuits for leveling.\n\nConclusion if you wanna have a shoot around for a bit and are not interested in getting far, its fun and i would suggest this as something fun to do....

This means that until you reach the experience cap you can play the game as you like and enjoy the game on your terms. You can use the weapons you like and play the events in game that you enjoy.\n\nOnce you hit the experience cap however the game turns into a major boring grind. In order to advance yourself to the level cap you will be required to complete pursuits (specific goals in order to obtain part of a level). This quickly becomes monotonous as you no longer are playing the game on your terms, you are not doing things you enjoy as you already completed all the pursuits from the things you enjoyed on your way to the experience cap.\n\nIn my opinion this is a terrible game design. Players should not be forced to do races, pvp, hunt for data recorders etc... to advance their progression if that's not what excited them to play the game to begin with. If you are someone who does not like pvp why should you be forced to do pvp events just so you can reach the level cap? If you are a pvp lover why would you want to spend weeks running around looking for data recorders just so your character can progress?\n\nTo summarize, this game is wonderful while you are able to play it how you like and progress your character doing things you enjoy. once you have reached the experience cap it quickly becomes a chore and monotonous to a large degree as the grind to reach the level cap is made up of tasks you avoided along the way. I cannot recommend the game to people as I believe that games should be fun from beginning to end, not just the first half.","June 1, 2015","false","74.4"," 96 of 121 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","96","121","0","3"

But those bugs are all but squashed now and the game is really solid.\n\nIt's like a mix of swtor, and borderlands 2. The way the area's are created has a Swtor feel, and your running around shootings things much like Borderlands, or so I hear. (I never actually played either Borderlands, but that's how people are describing it).\n\nWith only a few hours of game-play in it, I'm already getting my 10$ worth out of it easy, and the game story will draw you in. The characters personalities seem pretty solid as well, you'll hate them, love them, and get annoyed by the ones your supposed too.\n\nOntop of that, the customization for your character is pretty legit as well, not only being able to choose which weapon and side arm you want, (which is no limitations, you could go sniper rifle/Assault Weapon Sniper Rifle/Bazooka, Pistol/Energy Gun, or even Shotgun/Shotgun) No limitations in mix and matching weapons.\n\nJust like Swtor you can break down your weapons as well for parts and income, or add accessories and mods to them which will boost their ability, as well as change your characters headgear, and outfit to mix and match.\n\nDefinetly worth the 10$ easy.\n\nCons:\n\nThe few Con's I found are not huge, but could be a turn off for some players.\n\n1) The starting area's at least are pretty empty. To me this actually enhances the feel of it being a wasteland. If there were 100's of people running around, wouldn't feel like that, so to me this is actually a plus, but for others may be a turn off. There is a helpful automatic party finder however, which helps to get groups.\n\n2) The Chat system is totally implimented bad. You can never see what anyone is saying around you or in the area. To see it, you have to stop what your doing and press Enter. Which then a Chat screen the size of the entire screen pops up. Which only then can you respond. Terrible chat system for an action game, because half way through responding to what your friend just said your getting shot at, and need to stop.\n\nHowever if you use VOIP to talk with friends, again, the chat system is of no concern for you really.","January 10, 2014","true","13.9"," 124 of 178 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","124","178","0","12"

The story is solid and the voice acting is top notch, which it should be seeing as how it's based off a TV show. The game starts off great - lots of side missions, a large variety of enemies, weapons and gear, a good perk system that makes you want to level your character... but I'm 60 hours in and I feel like I've hit a plateau. I feel like I've experienced everything this game has to offer, and now it's a matter of grinding my character for better (not different, just better) gear, so I can fight harder (not different, just harder) enemies and so on. I've fought every kind of enemy in the game a hundred times, found every kind of gun, done every kind of mission and there's just nothing new to discover. A lot of people seem to disagree with me, as there are tons of very high level players in this game, but I've just lost interest and am not entertained by this game anymore.\n\nFor a F2P game, 60 hours of gameplay isn't bad. But MMO's are meant to be played long-term, with hundreds and perhaps thousands of hours of gameplay, but this one just petres out after a short while. It's free, so if you want to try it out there's no harm, and maybe you'll end up liking it a lot more than me.

I have not watched the TV show because it looks pretty lame, but if its as good as the game, I might eat my words twice. Because this game is FUN!!\n\nI have played over 45 hours in about 7 days since installing it. Its just a blast, you can ride a quad bike off a cliff, land on enemies and get kill points, barrel roll off the quad and start shooting while your still rolling. Its crazy, its brash, its got so many explosions your ears hurt and I LOVE IT!\n\nIt reminds me a great deal of City of Heroes. I played about 18 months of CoH when it released. I played a normal gun toter just to be different and my game experience in CoH was pretty similar to Definace. The graphics are cartoonish but appropriate, they represent the world in a way that is suitable for the type of game and the way the action plays out. Sounds are good, the music is ok but can get repetetive.\n\nThe range of guns and weapons is pretty staggeering and when you consider most guns have 4 modification slots and improvements to gain through mastering them, there is a massive amount of customisation. You can get a grenade launcher and give it rapid fire, incendiary and low recoil for example, its like a tennis ball shooter using fire grenades, its just MAD. There are assault rifles, pistols, auto and bolt sniper rifles etc etc etc, they all feel differrent and change appearance, feel and sound when you mod them.\n\nMissions are easy to find and plentiful. So far the best gear I have got has come from solo missions which provides incentive to keep doing them. The story line is acceptable and even good for an MMO.\n\nThe community is happy, helpful and firendly. Coop missions are available but can be hard to get going because the open world play is so much fun and so varied, people just dont seem to play the zone missions much. PVP is optional and easy to join in. But keep in mind the game has been going 12 months so you can run into some badass hombres. I was shooting one guy in the head point blank as he lay on the ground sniping and he basically ignored me for the first 4 shots lol, then got up and one shotted me.... but thats the life of a noob right?\n\nThe most fun I have had so far has been from the random events that happen a few times a day. Players seem to rush from all over to join in and even at low levels you can do some damage and get some good rewards while fighting massive exciting enemies in crazy open world combat.\n\nI am pretty impressed with Definace and I think like many MMOs it let itself down by releasing 6 months too early. If the product I am playing was the one that hit the market, Im sure it would have scored better.\n\nOn the down side, lag can be chronic at times, but daily server re-boots fix it, so its often a matter of timing as to how much lag you suffer. You hear lots of people complaining about it on chat so I know its not just me. Server reboots seem to be around 7pm AEST but can vary.\n\nI recommend you give this one a go, I will be playing it for some time I reckon. Its nice to see a game that remembers games are meant to be fun.","October 6, 2014","true","49.8"," 82 of 113 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","82","113","3","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xelluse/recommended/224600/","Xelluse","-{Geo}- Cegorach","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xelluse/","438 products in account","- I'll start from one of important mistakes I see in Defiance game Reviews - "Similar to". Game is not Similar to any other game in same genre, but it can remind many games you see before - Borderlands, Saints Row, BF, WH 40k atc... Also game is not standard and stamped MMORPG, don't wait Elves or Orcs here, it's Post Apocalyptic Earth, where is chaos and destruction.\n- Now will say about its gameplay - as I say game have nothing from standard RPG-TPSs, you don't have Classes here and not stuck to specific gameplay, shortly game isn't forcing you to play stumped class with stamped weapon, you are absolutely free in how, why and where to do, you can use any weapon, skill, so you are building your own gameplay, what is also very important and good for me, you are free to go and do what ever you want in Defiance world, also world is living its life and aggressively opposed against you, you have too many ways to progress your character and gameplay, sometimes it's confusing, but if you understand Defiance World it will become fun and easy.\n- Game is very specific in many ways, many things here are not explained from the beginning and new players can easily lost in Defiance world, but don't afraid, here is impossible to destroy gameplay, just do story and main quests and many things will become understandable for you. Defiance have very active and fun PvE and PvP content, in PvE you can move as solo same with friends and clan, on low levels much easier to do missions in solo because as more players are in same zone then harder is to kill enemies there for low levels, but moving in group will increase loot and fun, PvP content is very interesting, but feels unfinished yet, also DLC content makes it little unbalanced, if you are good TPS player you may not feel this,but if you are not "Pro" then you feel pain sometimes, especially on low, mid levels, DLCs give quite good shields, weapons and perks that in PvP are not OP, but gives not bad advantage to its owners in 1vs1 battles, but all battles are more massive than solo, also PvP here got many tactical nuances (they feel unfinished, but not bad for PvE oriented game), so it's not so big problem. It's not P2W, but with DLCs you will feel more comfortable with them more than without, but game is PvE oriented, so PvP here is like in many other PvE games, but quite fun as I say before.\n(*I used word "level" cos it's more understandable for new players, here is no level system, Defiance have progressing system called EGO Rating, which can remind leveling one, but is quite different thing)\n\n- Bad things I found here are : 1. side DRM and not best protected for now. 2. Game is forcing much to purchase Packs and DLCs what is quite bad thing for F2P games especially when game have no economical part at all, you can trade but it's useless here, its more forcing you to buy things you need, more then things you like to buy, in many F2P games you can purchase things in Cash and sell them to other players, so if some one didn't spend money, but spend time to farm he can help you to force your farm in exchange for the things you purchased for cash, so you get things you were interested in and he gets thing he was interested in. Or Cash exchanging system with other players which is becoming more and more popular nowadays and brings much more balance and fairness in game economy and gameplay, but trading with players is useless here, cos they can't use any content they didn't pay for and many of purchased things are untradeable, many games nowadays giving trading system when F2P players are working on PP players, what is way comfortable as for players who spend money same for players who didn't or can't and server got as money same massive amount of players what is very important for ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes and makes them much more fun and interesting (game can't MMO "Massive Multiplayer Online" when it don't have mass), but for now Defiance don't have any kind of economical part and because of this game probably will lose massive amount of players on EGO Rating 5000-5400+ in "endgame". 3. You can't use Steam wallet to purchase in game items, content. 4. Still have bugs like, Mobs hiding in textures and server drops. 5. Game at the "Endgame" (high levels - high EGO rating) is becoming quite repetitive cos here still is not much high level content, it's more harder version of low level ones, you will repeat things that you already did on low levels, but on harder difficulty. Also can say that Developers are working much and fixing many problems and bugs one by one, also adding much of fun content, so it's not very good for now, but still is very fun and I'm sure that soon time by time Developers will bring much more fun, various and hope balanced content in, but for now it feels like they are creating Single player game more then MMO from Defiance economical system, which is not good for the game, I think, cos nowadays MMO economy is much more flexible then just DLCs.\n\n- Good things I like here : 1. Game is very flexible and gives lots of freedom if compare to many other MMOTPS-RPGs. 2. Quite cleaver AI that is very rare nowadays, they are not waiting when you will kill them as in modern FPS or TPS games. Also world here is living its own life what gives Defiance very specific atmosphere and makes it quite interesting. 3. You are not tied to specific Class and to its Weapon, you are mixing your gameplay and you are free in your strategy, you can change your play style in any second and play as you wish and not as Class specification forces you. 4. For F2P game with DLC system it is not P2W, but gives many interesting things that you will not care much about in PvP. 5. Very atmospheric for Post-Apocalyptic game, you will feel yourself in really destructed world and not in paradise. 6. Very easy interface with many possible tactical and role-playing styles, in RPGs for me it's one of very important things when you are not playing on Piano, but still have many possible steps to do, console interface for some PC gamers may become confusing in the beginning, but very soon it will become quite comfortable and easy to use. 7. Game hardness is quite interesting thing here - it's same time hard and easy, as I say AI is quite cleaver here, they are trying to surround you, hide behind object, always move and do any thing that will make them hard targets and they are trying every thing to make from you an easy target for them, also AI quite often working in groups and very cohesively, that makes game very fun and not so easy as many modern games. 8. Story line... Never thought that I will be so steeped in ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes storyline and quests.\n\n- All written here are my opinions and feelings about Defiance, there are many things that I like and many things I don't, so I tried with my not best English (sorry for that) to explain my opinions about it, of course someone will agree and some one will not, but in last part I really can say that I Recommend this game, it becomes F2P so trying it is best way to understand you will like it or not, game is very specific in many ways and it make many players to love it and many to hate it, I like this game very much and still having lots of fun from it, there are many things to do and to have fun, also it's not stamped-standard MMORPG. It looks for now as modern gaming experiment, but in my feeling it's still experiment more and not finished product yet, but it have very big potential and I'm sure it can become really epic game, if Developers will work more on it, but despite this, game in this version is very, VERY FUN.\n- Not best, but not bad graphics and amazing atmosphere - 7/10, free and very flexible gameplay for MMORPG - 9/10, fun and various game modes - 7/10, sound and music - 9/10, controls - 8/10, AI - 9/10, progressing - 8/10, story - 9/10, Total - 8/10. So, I recommend it, try it,  but don't be hurry with your opinion, give Defiance some hours and start with main quests and then criticize it.","August 19, 2014","true","299.6"," 116 of 169 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","116","169","4","10"

I fear more so than any before it, and that includes World of WarCraft and Star Wars Galaxies.  If it were still as active as it was when the first season of the corresponding television show that shares it's name, I'd recommend it to anyone.  But the truth is that it's not.  It has too few people to consistently do anything in the game that you cannot do in a single-player game, and ultimately it will eventually get too boring and repetative for even the most loyal players.  The television show was great and I wish it wasn't cancelled, but now that it is no longer running and Trion Worlds owns the game, it feels even abandoned by its developers for the most part.  At this time, I can't recommend this MMO.","May 21","false","142.2"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","34","38","0","0"

I also have far, far more time in this game than it shows because I played for quite a while before it was added to steam, as well as playing in the alpha and beta tests.\n\nThe good:\n\nIt's an easy game to just pick up and play for an hour or so at a time, there's absolutely nothing that tries to force you to keep playing for long stretches at a time like overly long quests or time gates like a lot of MMOs have. You can log in and do a quest or a couple conflict sites, maybe an arkfall, or just run around killing random things and feel like you've accomplished something.\n\nThere's no real "builds", once you get to around 2k ego you can easily have all 4 active skills and most of the passives all maxed out. You're also not restricted to any particular weapon based on what "class" you choose when making a character, all that does is decide what starting outfit you have and that's purely cosmetic. You can use whatever equipment you want whenever you want to as long as your ego rating is equal to or higher than what's listed on the equipment, there's even multiple loadouts where you can completely customize your character's equipment, skills, and passives for different situations, essentially creating different classes that you can switch between on the fly.\n\nThe weapon skills have been made easier to level as well, you no longer stop gaining weapon skill exp when the weapon itself that you're using is maxed out and have to stop what you're doing and reset the mastery exp for that weapon.\n\n\n\nThe bad:\n\nThere's really only a couple of things here, but one of them is big. Freaking huge. Almost game breaking even, at least in my opinion.\n\nThe in game communication sucks, most people don't even notice it's even there for a long time and even when they do almost nobody uses it because it's such a pain in the ♥♥♥. If you want to play this then get in a guild that uses voice communication because you won't get anywhere trying to use the in game text chat.\n\nThe really big thing I don't like is this.....enemies auto scale to the person in the area with the highest ego rating when they spawn. The game itself is basically an open world map where you can go to anywhere at any time with no load screens unless you fast travel, and while this sounds neat (and to be fair, it is neat most times) it can easily screw people with lower ego ratings when someone with a much higher rating so much as drives past them. Any new enemies that spawn will be scaled to match that person and you can go from taking out regular trash enemies with 1 headshot from a bolt action rifle to suddenly needing 3-5 because the newly spawned enemies came in to match the person who zoomed past on their way somewhere else. It's not uncommon to suddenly be massacred by a wave of new enemies that spawned in and are an order of magnitude stronger than what you were just fighting a few seconds before.\n\nThis wouldn't be so bad if it was only in areas like arkfalls where a lot of people are expected to show up, or in co-op instances where it doesn't affect anyone who isn't in that particular instance, but it scales like this everywhere and there's absolutely no way to avoid it unless all you do is solo re-run the story quests that have their own instances to them. The game itself is fun but it's very frustrating for new players trying to get started when they constantly get screwed over by the poorly thought out scaling system.\n\nThe game USED to not have the kind of power creep where gear gets progressively stronger as you level and higher ego rating just meant you had access to more skills/passives and a wider variety of gear with better mods, but now it's like most other MMOs where you're forced to constantly upgrade your gear as it quickly becomes obsolete. To be fair you can upgrade your current gear with the salvage matrix instead of having to get new stuff, but it's a constant thing and you'll find yourself needing to stop and upgrade far too often, and you'll find yourself having a hard time deciding whether to sell loot or break it down into salvage to use for upgrades.\n\nIf you like third person shooters with slight RPG elements and don't mind the horrible level scaling mechanics then you'll probably like Defiance, but if having enemies suddenly start spawning in with 3x the HP and damage output because someone higher level showed up doesn't sound like your cup of tea then you may want to avoid this game for now and see if that changes in the future.","January 1, 2015","false","55.0"," 63 of 88 people (72%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","72","63","88","5","1"

There is no real story in the game, no complimentary information. Nothing.  And this is perhaps why the game seems so repetitive right from the start?\n\nGraphics and animation are reasonable. Animation is not at all smooth and movements not very realistic. Characters look disproportionate.  Your character is silent, which is a little odd.\n\nThe maps are open-world and simply huge, and this is one of the games strong points. However, they are poredictably very dull and repetitive for an mmo which makes exploring seem rather pointless.\n\nLag, at times, was also a real problem. Following friends they would suddenly lag for five to ten seconds. By the time they finally move they had jumped clean off the mini-map. Lag in combat, though, seemed low and perfectly playable.\n\nThe interface is poor. Very definitely designed for a console! On the PC it feels awkward to say the least. Not all the keys can be remapped either.\n\nThe chat is almost non-existent, so the game really doesn’t feel like an mmo at all. There is very limited social activity! You might consider that a good thing though!\n\nSkill mods are great, but you can’t switch setups.\n\nOn the really positive side of things, the game deals with multi-player combat well and the gun mods are excellent.   And I think those two points are really important. Get those two right and you have a game that a lot of people are going to enjoy. Not everyone cares about the story!\n\nSo recommend or not? Sheesh. Another hard one! I think you need to make up your own mind on this one. If you want story and depth, then no, don’t bother. But if killing stuff is your thing, then sure. Why not?\n\nI am going to say no, becuase "for me" I don't think the game has longevity. But I would at least recommend trying the game and making up your own mind.

Trions fix was to weaken each weapon as it was constantly used for that.  They really should have never had client side calcualations for these things to begin with.

I bought for me and my gf because we are big fans of the show but sadly it fails to deliver. The character customization is bad, the story is bad, the missions are extremely generic... The pc port is not thought-out at all, lacking even the necessary hotkeys for standard actions, like shifting between loadouts (equipment) or even opening some of the menu tabs. The worst thing of all though is that although the game is advertised as "pay-once" it really operates like a free-to-play rpg, even more so than other f2p rpgs like Tera. Most of the cool things in the game you have to pay extra money to purchase and even when you create a character, out of the THREE (seriously, why create such a great story with more than nine races just to make three available?) playable races you can only play two, human or irathient, unless of course you pay an extra 10 (!) euros to be allowed to play a castithan.

I logged on recently to play it for a couple of hours: it is either that the game is in its usual state of hybernation between two Defiance seasons on SyFy or the devs indeed found and fixed the cause of the lag issues, but I was able to beat a major in-game event without lag problems.\n\nSince Steam does not offer a neutral rating option, let me just say:\n\n- As a long term investment, I do not recommend this game. Myself, I learned my lesson the hard way, spending way too much time on a game that had a promising start with decent story content that tied in pretty well with the SyFy series, but failed to realize its potential. With more than 1000 hours of gameplay all I can say is 'hope dies hard'.\n\n- As a casual, Choice #2 game that you can play while waiting for the next BIG one... why not? It's free (unless you plan to invest into Epic Lockboxes) so if that's all you want then jump right in.\n\nJust do not get your hopes up, take everything the devs say with a pinch (or, actually, a bucket) of salt and it will be fine.\n\nReview summary:\nThis game is plagued by horrendous lag issues that the developers are unable to fix, and which will only get worse as they are about to introduce new content without eliminating the root cause of lag.\n\nGameplay is badly affected by controversial development decisions, too much reliance on the random number generator instead of creativity, decline in the quality of story missions.\n\nBefore you try this game I strongly suggest that you check the Defiance forums at http://forums.defiance.com/forumdisplay.php?3-General-Discussion  and read some of the posts.\n\nIn game activities:\nThe game activities include various events like minor and major arkfalls (spaceship wrekage crash landing in the game world: players need to fight mobs to win the event and claim the loot), sieges, incursions, races, so call hotspot challenges (you need to massacre a bunch of mobs while watching and keeping your score multiplier up by killing mobs before the multiplier resets), daily and weekly contract jobs, normal and expert co-op maps, PvP maps and a so called Shadow War that is more or less a phase open world PvP event. Also, there is a story mission (Season 1, Season 2) and episode missions, plus various arenas (like the hotspots these are also score multiplier based shoot'em up events).\n\n(Caveat: if you decide to try the racing challenges, be prepared. Your racing experience can be ruined by the "disappearing vehicle" bug (yep, the vehicle sometimes vanishes for no apparent reason), plus race tracks are not phased or instanced, and hostile mobs can spawn on you and crash you while you are hoping to finally get that gold ranking that you need for one of the achievements. Some people welcome the presence of hostile spawns as an additional challenge, others consider it an unnecessary source of frustration: losing due to lack of practice/skills is one thing, losing due to a bad game design decision is something different.)\n\nStory and episode missions: while the story and episode missions for Season 1 were fun (lots of cutscenes, even including in-game copies of some of the lead characters from the TV series), Season 2 was pretty much a major letdown. Trion went cheap on the amount of cutscenes, there are much less of them compared to Season 1, and in some of the DLCs all you get is reading datapads or listening to some mission updates via your EGO implant.\n\nEnd game content:\nThe only real end-game boss is the Warmaster, but you cannot create raid groups and even if you are grouped you can be easily dumped into a different instance, plus Trion nerfed the loot drop so much that currently it is a waste of time instead of a manageable challenge. (Extremely dedicated clans can still down the beast, but it requires meticulous arrangements).\n\nCash store:\nYou can buy a outfits (usually recoloured mash-ups based on a few basic variants), vehicles, various boosts (xp, score, reputation boost), lockboxes (that contain random selection of  weapons). The same lockboxes can be bought in-game for keycodes that you can earn by scoring high at major events (arkfalls, sieges, etc.). If you bought DLC 5 (Arktech Revolution), you can also buy Arkforge that you can use to upgrade your weapons (both rarity and rating).\n\nLag, lag, lag, lag... and more lag:\nStill the game would be fun if it weren't for the lag. The lag is so bad that you can log in, do some solo mission without issues, but as soon as you try to participate in a siege or arkfall event (where the turnout is usually pretty high), you'll get de-synced from the server (which means that you'll see frozen mobs and players, or players who are still running around and shooting things you cannot see; your weapons do no damage, you cannot pick up loot drops, switch weapons, etc.) and after a while you'll either get disconnected with a critical timeout error or you can run around in an empty game world until you finally force-close the game or the server decided to miraculously re-sync you when the number of major events drop to a certain level and it can again handle the load.\n\nWhile the developers made some efforts recently to remedy a few cricital gameplay and balance issues, it is clear that Defiance is a despised stepchild of Trion. Support is so bad, it may take weeks to get a reply to your support tickets (or you need to complain loudly on the forums/contact the Community Managers). If you do not buy anything from their cash store, you are not entitled to chat support. Server issues are barely noticed and handled by the staff on weekends.\n\nIn nutshell, after a decent start this game is now on a backburner. Trion will obviously keep the game running in order to meet their contractual obligations, but Defiance is definitely not a development priority.","October 5, 2014","false","129.8"," 44 of 64 people (69%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","69","44","64","8","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDailyDino/recommended/224600/","TheDailyDino","TheDailyDino","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDailyDino/","315 products in account","!!! DEFIANCE !!!\n\nDefiance gives a completely fresh and new to the MMO-Shooter genre, With its focus primarily on PvE content. There is a large amount of content that the player is able to experience within Defiance, in a very large open world environment. Their dynamic content is extremely fun to play, using the RIFT/Guild Wars 2 Event content and twisting it to fit this new environment. The ground breaking link between game and TV show is a very interesting idea and it will be great to see how this progresses.\n\nI feel that the overall gameplay of Defiance is extremely polished and fun to play. It makes it easy for someone who is used to MMO’s who doesn’t normally play shooters feel right at home. MMO’s are my favoured genre and I found it easy to get in to and enjoy Defiance, not typically being a shooter player. This could be due to the simple and easy to follow tutorial in the game.\n\nHowever, there are certain shooter features which are sorely lacking in Defiance, prominent ones being the lack of a prone option, as well as no active cover options, like hugging and popping out from behind a wall. Addition of one or both of these would be a valuable addition to the game and could make the game play even more interesting. Furthermore, I personally dislike the camera view, I have never been fond of the ‘over the shoulder’ camera as to me it makes aiming feel wrong, and doesn’t seem like you are really aiming as the character, I would feel more comfortable with a true third person camera angle, from behind the character, or first person. The UI also feels rather clunky and less than intuitive on PC, having clearly been built primarily with consoles in mind.\n\nThe fact that Defiance has been released on PC, Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 will allow for people of both the MMO and shooter fan bases all coming together in a single game. Though, of course, these platforms will all be playing separate from one another (sadly). I would expect that the consoles will see more of the shooter fan base, and as such more PvP action. However, on PC I would expect that the game will be played more by the MMO fan base, and as such I would think that the PvP experience would be a little sparser.\n\nHaving said that, Defiance has two options available to aid with initiating PvP, there is the typical small scale instanced battles that MMO players will be well attuned with, as well as a large open world PvP option known as the shadow war. The shadow war allows players to fight one another and claim control of territory, the more people who join the battle, the larger the area of combat becomes. Also, as more people join the shadow war more vehicles become available for use, some of which will include weaponry to aid in combating your adversaries. This could be an extremely fun way to play PvP and fight against your fellow players, rather than alongside them.\n\nI feel that Defiance is a great game and should at least be given a chance by both the MMO players and shooter players out there. It really is revolutionary to the genre, linking the game in with a TV show and all of the dynamic content available. It is also very refreshing to see an MMO-Shooter which focuses on PvE rather than PvP. I look forward to seeing how this progresses, and whether both the game and TV show will be able to endure together.\n\n- XeroSyphon","June 14, 2014","true","90.5"," 54 of 82 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","54","82","0","5"

I really loved this game, but the changes that caused my leaving still strike deep to my gaming core. If they fine tuned the mechanics changes, then it will be better gaming wise. But they still have all the extra money types, still has that P2W system (seriously, if you have to use real money to buy anything in game that benefits your character, that is P2W.), failed DLC promises (so DLCs are basically just reskins) and then free game status.\nIt's not that I am upset about having paid and then the game go free not long after. I honestly don't care about that. It's the playerbase that comes with free games that sucks. You have your legitimate hard-up-on-cash players, then you just have the annoying "griefers" or whatever they're called. The latter taking up a majority of the free-player base.\n\nSorry the show failed, but you can still save the game!\n\n(HINT: Auto balancing to where newbies and veteran players were "comparable" was what really killed this game. Playing it solo without my friends was tedious, boring and frustrating. If you didn't have a mass amount of people, you were pretty much guaranteed to die. You're only a newb for a short time, deal with it. Toughen up. Become a seasoned hellbug killer. It creates a better unity amongst the playerbase as well.)\n\n\n\n\n***This will be a long review because I am leaving my former review up so that people can see the drastic change of attitude toward this game.***\n\nBefore April of 2014, I would have recommended this game to anyone looking for a good MMO to play. After April of 2014, my positive recommendation has become a great big, huge, monster of a negative. The core fighting style of the game was completely revamped in a way that drove off most of the player base, it has made the game 9 parts frustraing and the other part is a mixture of annoyance and some enjoyment (because the driving is still fun). Some, few really, will say that it is still playable and isn't that hard, to you I greatly disagree. Myself, my fiance and our mutual friend rocked this game every weekend and almost every weekday, doing very well on our pursuits, arkfalls and so on.\n\nNow, just 10 minutes of this game is enough to send us running in the other direction. It greatly saddens me that this game has been treated this way by Trion. Taking out the biggest part of the game and replacing it with something that it wasn't even originally in the field of vision during creation is stupid.\n\nOn to the DLCs. I was left unimpressed by the DLCs, there were many promises before all 5 were released that there might be clan oriented things and other fun extras - but none of that has come. Instead you get some "new" missions and then a bunch of reskinned gear. Woohoo. Granted, my fiance and I each purchased a DLC (myself castithan and he Arkbreaker) and we were fine with doing so - until now. Now we view this whole mess as a great big waste of money. The DLCs have little to no real content, Arkbreaker being the most worthwhile. The last two DLCs were released with only a month difference, what does that say about the effort put into the fifth?\n\nThis is my first negative review and I hate typing it because for the longest time I defended this game and Trion, now I just feel like a fool.\n\nNow onto the upcoming change in June. Defiance is going Free-To-Play...... with subscriptions (for xp boosts and such). It is being turned into a Pay To Win type game and to that I have a big resounding F-U-see where I am going with this. It is claimed that this was the intention from the beginning, but if you, like myself and many others, have kept up on this game since the beginning (or nearly there) you would know this to be a big fat, greedy lie. The devoted players who bought the game in the first place are getting screwed, like so many other gamers these days who put their trust and money into games. Everything is going pay to win and it is ridiculous. That was a HUGE reason why we first even bothered with this game, because the only things you had to pay for in the beginning were the DLCs.\n\nNow it is obvious that Trion just wants more money and doesn't care about the enjoyment of the players and certainly does not appreciate them.\n\nStay away from this game unless you don't mind pay to win, even then I would suggest staying from it because they have broken it and have only been doing hokey "repairs" with the tech equivilant elmer's glue and scotch tape.\n\n(Sorry if this has a more rant feel than a review. Every time I start writing a review I get annoyed. I no longer have anything positive to say about this game. Trion, you really screwed yourself. This could have been an AMAZING game if you had just appreciated the players and what they had to say. But no, money speaks louder than the words of hundreds of players. And no trolls telling me "but you have to have money to", I know this. I know this very freaking well, and Defiance has been going on long enough that they don't need to pull these BS tactics to make more. If they had just released worthwhile DLCs they could have been raking in the cash.)\n\n\nPRE-APRIL 2014 REVIEW\n\nIf you are looking for a good MMO to play with friends that have a sci-fi-esque atmosphere. Look no further. At first I didn't even want to give this game a try due to the fact I don't particularly like the show. But I was pleasantly surprised when I downloaded the demo and found that it was not completely wrapped up and tied in with it's namesake. Shortly after experiencing the gameplay and the kick bum driving physics, I bought the game and haven't regretted it since.\n\nWith the upcoming update this month (February), the chat should hopefully be fixed and increase my enjoyment of playing even more. Myself and two friends spent almost 2 years looking for a MMO we could enjoy together and this was the one we stuck with. We didn't want something that was pay to win or had monthly fees and this game does not have those two things. There is DLC content, but the nice thing about that is that you do not have to get them to continue the game (I.E. You want to get to EGO 4000? Buy DLC 2! It's the only way you're gonna get it.), they are purely additives, which is how a DLC should be, imo.\n\nIt does, like many games, have bugs and glitches. Personally I have not come across any that have brought my gameplay to a halt. But at the moment I haven't even reached EGO 1000, so I am certainly not as far as many other players.\n\nDownload and try the Demo first! This game may or may not be for you so you should definitely test it before making a commitment. It's pretty much perfect for me!! If you are still wary about purchasing it even after the demo, I'm sure it will go on sale for a reasonable price soon.\n\n\nEdit: Chat has been fixed! It is a HUGE improvement and because of the goodly change, I ended up making a new in-game friend! The first in my 70+ hours thus far :D","February 3, 2014","false","129.3"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

The game is 95% PvE oriented, with the remaining 5% being a "Shadow War" PvP type mode in which players compete for point control, often granting things like the aforementioned Arkfalls.\n\nThe graphics are extremely decent for an MMO, and should run smooth on most machines/setups, even during large player amounts. Of course, using the control panel of the GPU to enhance the it further - can never hurt, I'd recommend adding extra anti-aliasing at least.\n\nThe character creator is quite weak, not having sliders or anything of the sort, only pre-determined eyes, face build, lengths etc. Although there are 3 races to choose from which are Humans, Irathients & Castithans. Irathients being more feral & spiritual-minded, whilst Castithans are the more 'civilized' of the 2, although you NEED to buy the Castithan Charger DLC to be able to choose the Castithan race. (I recommend getting all DLC, in the form of the season pass).\n\nThere are LOT of weapons & types in it, comparable to Borderlands - there is every weapon you can imagine, also Alien AKA 'Votan' weapons & you can also add weapon modifications (that also change the visual appearance of the weapon), and there are types like Electricity, Poison, Fire etc..\n\nThe main story missions & side missions are very numerous, especially when owning all DLC. But you will often find yourself doing those Arkfalls, which is highly enjoyable & quite rewardable.\n\nThis is probably one of the best MMO shooters that I have ever played.\n\nNow that it's Free2Play I highly recommend everyone to try it out.\nAlso if possible, watch the TV series (it's like Game of Thrones but Sci-Fi based).\n\nPersonal score: 8/10\n\nBest regards,\nDukhat","June 4, 2014","true","194.8"," 177 of 307 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","177","307","0","3"

Gunplay is solid and you get the expected amount of MMORPG stats and grinding.\n\nWhere it falls short is in the showstopping bugs and lag.

On my second character the second main quest completely broke rendering me unable to obtain the first vehicle or progress the campaign.

Time trial route points don't show (or take too long to appear) making it pointless to try, and you'll desync from the server a lot, requiring logouts which sometimes work for a while before needing them again.\n\nOne might point out that of course MMOs can and always do have network issues, but a quick perusal of the official forums indicates that these same issues have been ongoing since at least mid-2013.

I have logged 20 hours in the game as of this writing and I want to keep playing more why? Well because its a Free To Play MMO that has me entertained and its really good.\n\nI was first involved with this game back in Alpha and Beta and I did like what the game offered and the sci-fi ♥♥♥♥♥♥me it was but I didn't get the game on release for a few reasons such as the price, it needed some more polish from its Beta period but the biggest reason was the idea of it being pushed out to meet the release of the TV series.\n\nNow that the game went free to play on Steam I decided to download it and try it out. After playing for many hours here is what I have to say.\n\nStarting off you only get two character slots, I usually don't play more then 1 or 2 characters so thats ok, for those who like to play every class or combination of main skill talents then there options to get more slots by either a monthly subscription or paying to open more of them.\n\nYou can choose the race you want to play and the class you want them to be as well as well as the gender. The classes you can choose from are Outlaw, Machinist, Survivalist, Veteran and the playable races are Human and Irathients.\n\nThe game has a fast lead in to the action and gets you going nearly right away. The intro cinematic isn't to long but long enough to get you into the story and your interest perked in the game.\n\nAs for the missions in the game there are oh so many. The main story line are done as Seasons like the TV series. There are also many, many side missions, I mean many. There are also in game events called Arkfalls.\n\nArkfallAll players are alerted when a major Arkfall is taking place, and even the environment changes to set the mood. Skies blacken, falling meteorites can be seen falling from space into the Earth’s sky and finally slamming into the ground.\n\nMinor Arkfalls occur frequently throughout the Defiance world, and involve the descent of small clusters of debris from space. These can be usually tackled by a solo veteran Ark Hunter or a pair of adventurers, and can be completed in a shorter span of time.\n\nThere is so much more to talk about with missions to do but I will say that you will come across lots of things to do and you won't have to worry about looking for what to do.\n\nYou can add mod slots to weapons to be able to add a mod to it. Master a weapon to increase your skill on it and increase the weapons rarity to increase its stats.\n\nI really liked how you can change your characters appearance with outfits and helmets. This doesn't do anything other then a cosmetic look. The whole game is voiced to so need to read lengthy mission logs. You will even recognize some some of the voices. I think a few voices actors did work in the Fallout games.\n\nEverything the game offers you don't have to pay real money to get, just spend the time getting your factions levels up or saving your in game currency called script and then purchase it.\n\nI played the game with the Xbox360 controller and the game really is made to accommodate it.\n\nOverall I am very impressed with the game and hours of play it offers and for being a free to play game it is definitely worth the price.\n\nPro's\nLots of game play\nAuto join for events and missions\nEverything is voiced\nHidden Vendors to find\nCustomizable appearance\nIts free\nCon's\nIt had a bad launch\nSpecial codes from the tv series to use for game only available to the US\nI give this game:\nːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starː","August 6, 2014","true","61.8"," 38 of 60 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","38","60","0","6"

But way too much forced content, and the devs have no idea what leveling is.\n\n-The NSFW part of the game means they shoehorned a few swearwords and sexual themes in after writing and voicing the script using voice actors of famous 'Fisher Price' toys. It really has no place in the original script and you can easily tell how forced it is.\n\n-Leveling is a joke in this game. The devs tried to make it as even as they could across all character levels by increasing dps as you level up while keeping npcs HP the same. Some where around 50,000 HP for not even dangerous npcs. This is all fine except for if you're starting out, and your anywhere under level 100 and your dps is say 10, you will have to shoot the same npc for minutes to kill each one. Breaks the line between 'Challenging' and just plain unenjoyable.\n\nPros:\nCool community\nMap, HUD, Level Design, Mission Scripting is quite nice. Well done and pleasant to look at.\nLots of voice acting\nPretty Cool lore\n\nCons:\nNo Leveling\nBuggy as ♥♥♥♥\nWorst in game menu UI by far\nNSFW part is a huge faceplam\n","April 9, 2015","false","29.1"," 34 of 53 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","34","53","3","0"

All of the 5 DLC have been release perhaps not so much in a timely manner but they feel a little rushed through regardless. Trion still in my opinion are sitting on a potential goldmine but no where near as much as before it went free to play.\nBest thing about free to play is more people to kick around with. Unfortunately it's hard to tell if they are sufficiently happy enough with the game to buy enough product (new packages) as well as the standard DLC and or Season Passes to give Trion the financial boost they have used as the excuse for many of these changes they have made.\nHere's where the game is now:\n- You need the Glyph loader even through Steam so Trion can show you the games they have available if you didn't already know and I guess it may make them feel like the 'Big Companies' that have similar. Unfortunately it's glitchy with issues for almost every game in their catalogue as forums in Rift and Defiance in particular with reflect.\n- Free to Play makes the risk of investment almost zero beside intial install/download and Trion would love you to consider purchasing items to 'enhance' your gameplay experience if you decide you do like what they are offering.\n- Customer support in terms of live chat is now charged for (not a big drawback) aside from spates of up and down server stability where that could annoy any particularly new gamer that really must get back into the game asap etc.\n- The ability to upgrade weapons more than 1 level of rarity has been removed (this gutted me to an extent, since I had a fairly awesome collection of gear simply waiting for me to grind enough Ark Forge to be able to use this feature).\n- You will have to endure to some degree server instabilty issues that fluctuate in so many ways I can't be bothered listing them here, merely check the Defiance forums on almost any given day of the week lately in particular. Hopefully this will be fixed soon as has been in the past.\n- Something else you will have to endure are new players with no idea of the journey the game has had (myself only having played from Jan 2014) telling the whole world in zone chat how petty people are and what a great game Defiance is etc fanboying a game they have played for less than a month/30 hours. They will say things like 'Trion is a business and they have to make money like any other' but when you ask them how much are you intending to spend on this game because as you said yourself Trion is a business etc, they deflect off that issue. Bringing me to my summary and hopes for Defiance.\nI find it odd Trion doesn't do more to get the free to play people to actually part with their money since the majority of changes to the game's structure and mechanics were made using this as the fulcrum.\nI personally hope that free to play people are happy enough with the game to purchase at least $20-$30 worth of Defiance product in the form of DLC or bits usable in the in game store because otherwise Trion has turned their backs on a huge chunk of its faithfull on what is hard to see as anything but poorly planned and executed free to play. Seven P's apply here, ♥♥♥♥-poor planning and preparation equal ♥♥♥♥-poor performance and results. Here's to the hope of free to play gamers helping to save the game for all of us, Trion in particular I guess.\n\nUPDATED REVIEW 10 Feb 2014.\nToday the 7th legion DLC was released and the chat system is a lot better and has customisable tabs selection well, you can edit them and select 1 to 4 tabs of chat options. Also, the friends notification settings and others seemed to be fixed as well, fingers crossed it stays like this. I'm not even going to bother to critique 7th Legion or the game any further. Many people think its meh already but to be honest any new content is welcome in my opinion. It's hard to say if each dlc is worth the 10 or so dollars but if you haven't got the season pass and have none of the dlc, it's worth looking around for one. I paid $27-30 can't remember exactly and while the content isn't huge, for the 5 expected dlc which I've heard are taking their sweet time in coming, for what I paid on top of the Deluxe Edition was worth it for me. Still loving the game and my luck in finding friends and groups to play with plus the added 10% bonus scrip and xp boosts getting the Deluxe really helped me out a lot in terms of my character progession and enjoyment, but you can just 'lone wolf' it too.\nAll the negetives are out-weighed by the fact this game is the only MMO of its kind and many comparisons to other games can be made of course but this is a great game in my opinion. Just remember to keep a backup of the game install folder somewhere regardless of what version you use just in case that verify game file bug hits you like it did my Steam version, but I've read of others with similar experiences using the direct digital download from Trion. During patching it breaks and you will be waiting for the 13GB as it stands now to download all over again. I left my previous review below. By the way, many thanks and respects to all my friends in Defiance and I guess some gratitude for Trion finally fixing the bugs so far (knock on wood). :)\n\nPREVIOUS REVIEW FOR REFLECTION.\nRemoved this as the issues in the game listed that are still there are mentioned above. The rest that were mentioned in this original review have been dealt with to at least an acceptable level so  fairs fair to Trion and the game itself etc.","January 25, 2014","true","497.9"," 28 of 43 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","28","43","0","2"

But when you look at the game and how it connects to the series and how much 'Free2Play' the game it, I really would not recommend it.\n\nThe only thing Defiance shares with the series is the name and general settings. Okay, you start with Nolan and his adopted daughter in the San Fransisco Bay area (were they not in the Defiance area in the series?), but that's basically all that connects this game to the series. YOU WILL NEVER REACH DEFIANCE ITSELF! IMO they basically could have ditched the whole Defiance series link and just made it a generic non-IP shooter.\n\nThen Free2Play... I've bought the game when it was still Buy2Play and because of that I have certain 'benefits'. Heck, I have even bought the season pass, but by now the greed of TRION almost made those purchases pretty much void. With the latest patch I have gained limits to my daily and weekly gain of a lot of major (currency) items that I need to progress through the game. This means that upgrading my gear will be slowed down by at least 75%, and it's the gear upgrades that are so important in the game. And though I have a higher limit on those gains because I've purchased Defiance and the season pack, I really can't imagine how bad it'll be when you're a 100% free player.\nAn other thing that bugs the hell out of me is the ca$h $hop. It has so many overpowered and game breaking items in it (mainly in lockboxes so you have to gamble on what you get to start with) that the PvP aspect of the game has become heavily Pay2Win!\n\nIn general, it's a good game, but as usual the greed of TRION has made the game unplayable, unless you either subscribe to the game (what's the use of a free game then) or are willing to spend a lot on the ca$h $hop","August 23, 2015","false","122.1"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","24","36","6","1"

Its shame this game is such a mess as the world based on series is a great concept, and overall idea is nice.\n\npros:\n- cool idea to mix mmo with a series and add new quests related to it as the show progresses\n- visuals are okay, nothing amazing though\n- quite big map and it was fun to explore it\n- some nice weapon ideas\n- quest cinematics were quite well done (at least for the first half of it)\n\ncons:\n- very limited options, game looks and behaves like a bad console port\n- if you havent watched the series, main quest makes little sense\n- most of the costumes you get look very similiar\n- the amount of bugs is pretty crazy considering game is over year old (models going invisible, random lag spikes/crashes -     game doesnt even pop an error for about 10 mins, making you run arround when you are disconnected, vehicles dissapearing sometimes while you mount them, crosshair disspearing and going console mode (no crosshair and auto aim) randomly, theres propably more, thats all I remembered\n- half way through main quests they have diffrent voice actors, with HUGE decrease in quality both in acting and actual audio quality that sounds like home made recording\n- quests are very repetitive, basically only 4-5 variants of mission over and over, either bring something, go somewhere or kill few waves of enemies\n- theres no storage for your characters\n- skills are mostly passives, with only 4 actives to choose from, can only use one\n- a lot of game content locked behind dlc paywall\n- co-op instances and missions were incredibly boring, just waves after waves until you get to boss\n- no classes\n- only 2 pvp modes\n- the pvp in the game is horrible mess, it looks like alpha state. Theres a ton of glitches, wallhackers, aimbots, and apparently dev doesnt care about making a proper anti cheat or even banning hackers, most basic stuff using cheat engine seems to work, ppl using blatant speed hacks and dmg hacks. Then comes the problem with weapons, the only viable ones are sniper rifles, grenade launchers, shotguns and infectors, funnily enough except the sniper all of those require little to no aiming, aoe weapons hitting as hard or harder than single target ones. You either use the glitches and the overpowered weapons or you gimp yourself\n- felt more like single player game for the most part\n\ntl;dr\nPlay it only if you enjoyed the series and want nostalgia ride, otherwise stay away. You can get about 20-30 hours doing only main quests, but to be honest I quite regret doing even that, at it was plain dissapointing for the majority of it.\n3/10","August 30, 2014","false","76.4"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

I started right around start of the volge warmaster and stopped at the alcatraz update so here's my review note that it may vary slightly from the PC version but not too much hopefully.\n\nI am slightly biased towards liking this game because it was my first MMO.\n\nPros\n1. No class restrictions. When you start out you choose one of four classes which the only thing you get from them is an exclusive outfit which everyone replaces quickly.\n\n2. Outfits- 90% of the outfits can be unlocked without having to pay for any of them and in my opinion all the paid for outfits are junk. The weapons unfortunately have a single unchangeble skin each.\n\n3) Weapons- The variety of weapons is almost on par with borderlands with everthing from guns that infect you with minature parasites to shotguns that shoot grenades,\n\n4) DLC- The DLC are average price at $10 each so it's nice to pick one up every once in a while (I recommend 7th legion as your first you get your sword and some good guns.) They said from what I remember that they were going to leave it at the current 5 DLCs available right now.\n\n5) Gameplay- The way it feels as you aim and shoot is nice. It's third person but your character never seems to be in the way of where you're shooting.\n\n6) Arkfalls- These are massiveplayer events that are constantly happening (I"ve never seen less than 2 or 3 on a map) where you will either be clearing waves of small enemies or fighting one giant enemy with 40-50 people backing you up. It always feels as though your part of something greater.\n\n7) Clans- The clans are good and never in the way. You can get bonuses from being in clans that have more rep. Never fear for those who want to start up a clan just for themselves or for them and their friends, the rep is rather easy to earn and going solo you'll have the max tier reward in a month.\n\nMuch as I hate to admit it this wonderful game has downsides.\n\n1) Trolling- Not as big a problem on PC from what I've seen but on console people will use high FPS guns to crash other people's games. Group members can be kicked by group leaders and if you're doing a random 4 player "dungeon" you're giving others the chance to troll you.\n\n2) Servers- They are rather laggy on console you couldn't go 30 minutes without getting booted from the server on PC i only got booted once in the 5 hours I played and that's because my router suddenly reset itself.\n\nI'll post more eventually but I'm tired.","October 4, 2015","true","5.0"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","16","23","2","0"

In many ways it includes the things I like from GW2 and The Secret World.\n\nNice implementation of random event spawning, easy and engaging story, slick co-op objectives on missions, reasonable graphics, simple combat/weapons, slick vehicle implementation, and nice skill slotting.\n\nWhat it suffers from mostly is poor MM implementation. The chat system is awkward, the mission co-op mode doesn't even require you team unless you specifically choose to do so, and customization of your character is limited - set outfits rather than outfit bits to mix and match, but I was definitely spoiled by CoH there. In addition the weapon system modding could use some refinement - too many weapons not enough mods, and the reputation system could use a little more explanation (tho I am getting that down now some, too).\n\nAll in all, I give it a A-/B+ as a game. B- as an MMO, far from the horrible reviews I've seen. Maybe I haven't gotten to end game issues, or grind problems. Definitely worth playing.","November 4, 2014","true","70.8"," 39 of 67 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","39","67","5","0"

There's truck loads of guns, the loadouts aren't complicated, and the loot system is personalised.  The game has heaps of variation, and there's always something to do that fits your mood, from quiet story mission progress, where sometimes people will turn up to help, through minor arkfalls, where you'll often find a relatively small group of people, to those major arkfalls which are usually quite massive and intense.  There are plenty of other types of events too, and your EGO rating scales according to the difficulty of the event at hand, whether it be an arkfall, incursion, or something else, so you'll never be too far outgunned.\n\nIf you do get into Defiance, I recommend getting the Season Pass, it will unlock many new features, offer some bonuses, and adds more content, but it's by no means required.  The paradise patron pass is good value for money, if you don't mind spending on your games.  I played WoW for 7 years, so I'm used to paying to play.  I don't recommend the Recruit, Hunter or VBI Ultimate Packs.  The character upgrades only apply to one character rather than all characters on the one account, which is silly in my opinion.  It is cheaper to buy Bits (ingame currency), and purchase the particular character upgrades that you want at the time.\n\n\nPros:\n\nThere's a lot to discover (including some stuff that might better be explained earlier - spikes and stims)\nDefiance has a lot of variation\nMajor events are only about half an hour long, and there's plenty of them\nUnique and interesting leveling and skill system (EGO)\nPlus many more\n\n\nCons:\n\nOnce more than about 60 people are playing in an event, lag can start to creep in, although I personally have never been disconnected.  The larger events (100 people) can get very choppy indeed at times.  Having said that, it's more common for about 30 to 50 people to turn up to large events, depending on time of day.","August 11, 2014","true","633.1"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","1"

This dlc, changed the game so that eneimies are now so redicously over powered, you would have to spend about $200-$500 real money to power up your weapons and armor just to survive as they also nerfed drop rates to an absymally low rate.\n\nDo not buy this game, do not support Trion.

The largest problem I had in the game was the fact I kept getting weapons I couldn't used due to them being part of the DLC's. Without the DLC's you will get reall good weapons, but you won't be able to use them. It makes it difficult to keep the inventory in check because of this and to get more inventory you will need to use actual cash to get it, amongst other things as well that will give you the boost to win. This also includes PVP, most players have the money to get the best gear so if you're playing for free you will have a bad time.

It is all based on what weapon you decide to use.\n-You can join in a 'boss' fight with others with no party or any hindrance to others.\n-Mobs are scaled to your 'ego rating' or level, so they level up with you.\n-When others join, mobs are also powered up to give a challenge.\n-There are plenty of 'pursuits' or achievements to try and attain.\n-Fast travelling (teleporting) to towns is free, and can be done in combat or not.\n-There is a self-revive which refreshes itself after a while, and others can revive you. If not it only costs a little money to be resurrected at the last checkpoint you activated.\n\nWhy I don't recommend this game:\n-Gameplay may be boring after some time, grinding map events for exp but the same goes for most other mmos\n-Inventory is very limited and there is no bank, Only 35 slots whether you equip items or not (Expansion requires cash)\n-Bugs or glitches are not uncommon.\n-Your 'ego rating' or level grows pretty fast so you have to upgrade to a new weapon often.\n-Weapons are of random drop, all types and rarity. Unless buying from a 'supplies' vendor, theres no guarantee to what weapon you might get from bosses.\n-Some weapons are DLC locked, you can get them but they cannot be equipped.","May 16","true","407.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

The story is, well, boring..the quests are common fare for MMORPGs, they get, again, repetitive quickly. The idea of, essentially, "rifts"(sound familiar?) in the world that all players have to join to close was cool originally, but there's zero variety in how the scenarios play out- Blast hellbugs, kill queen, repeat.  If Trion wanted to make a new MMO, they could have at leasted evolved their ideas a bit.\n\nAnother issue is that the weapons don't feel powerful when you shoot them. It feels like you're clicking and boom - burst of color, bad guy dead. Not satisfying in the least.\n\nLoot? Well, guns and a smattering of armor. Nothing really stood out. That leads me to another point - The game's presentation feels horribly bland after about an hour of play. After an hour, you have essentially beheld all the environments within the game, barring minor variations.\n\nLeveling up and skills? Really basic, not many options, not much class diversity. I had no urge to keep doing quests and closing rifts, as the rewards for doing so, and leveling up, were underwhelming.\n\nI had hoped that this would be a great sci-fi ♥♥♥♥♥♥me, but it's not.

As with many of their games they'd just be better off going completely serious or silly, but they always choose to go half way and do both. The game's a bit buggy and its a painfully obvious console port. I haven't even figured out how to form a group yet because a lot of these menu things are so unintuitive. The inventory screen is a vertical list without any way to sort through it properly.\n\nThe vehicle mechanics are actually good and they can be used as weapons. It functions surprisingly well as a third person shooter. Guns can be customized in many different ways however you can only carry two weapons at any given time.\n\nSome characters are terrible, some have terrible voice acting, the alien curse words are plain annoying, and the combat music is insufferable after a while.\n\nBasically, it deserves the 6/10s you see it getting all over a place.

While almost everything was lacking the certain somthing but still was rather solid. There is a reason why I have put in 440hours however the problems have shown their face with the most recent "DLC".\n\nFor starters this so called DLC really adds next to nothing new to the game but rather fully reworking the AI and difficulty systems that the game once had making this "DLC" more of a major patch. Now normally a combat rework is a good thing depending, but this one was made to give end game content that little bit more and make it so your level actually ment more then a simple e-peen status but in doing this Trion has managed to make the game near impossible for low-mid level players.\n\nHow the combat system works is that depending on what your and your freinds combined ego rating is depends on the threat level of the area you are in is. Now the problem with this is the MASSIVE divide it has driven between lower and higher level players. This means that if your level is only 20 and a ego 5,000 comes by it will instanly jump the area threat level to 10 (the highest) and then it will take that level 20 his entire ammo load (ammo load not clip) to even have a chance to kill 1 mob while having to be dodging for his life as he will be 1 shotted.\n\nThis is a major problem and has already driven the masses out of the game but there is worse to come. Being a mid level player (like myself) ego ~3,000 and every zone you enter the threat level is 7. Issue here is that at ego 3,000 there is no real weapon part from maybe a ground punder or sniper that can kill a mob without using an entire clip. BTW these are just normal mobs not bosses.... Also the fact that after spending 440 hours in the game to build up my gear and was hitting 1st in alot of world events only to have most of my gear now useless is a real off putting experience.\n\nEnd result from this last "DLC" Trion seems desperate and seems more like a big -give us money and get lost- kind of deal rather then a -This is for the players- like it should be. The population of the game has plumated and i don't see a near recovery but what i do see is a game in desperate need of fixing or it will go under fast.","April 19, 2014","false","521.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

I suppose you could compare it to Rift (which I've never played) or like Tera Online's Nexus events.  Seeing as I have never played Rift, I'll try to sum up what "Nexus" is in Tera.  Essentially, a large number of players converge into one area to team up and fight a large number of mobs that pop out of different Nexus portals.  It's essentially one huge cluster♥♥♥♥ of players doing nothing tactical or strategical.  They're just killing mobs.\n\nThat basically sums up Defiance.  It's like taking one small part of an MMO and turning it into a game.  And adding guns.  In fact, you could probably go hundreds of hours into this game and never talk to a single person.  I kid you not.  There's no marketplace and trying to chat with any one is a big pain in the butt.  Just about anything you do in this game is just one big cluster♥♥♥♥ of players running around and shooting things.  There is no need to talk to any one because there are no tactics.\n\nWhile I can see the appeal of this game to some people, I personally cannot recommend Defiance in good faith.

The Hunter Requisition is the main problem. 3 points per week for people without Patron pass and 10 /weeks for those have still not enough to complete the whole week for all contracts. Seem like Free to play players are forced to Pay for Patron or the hunter requisition points. How about everybody get 10 points per week and the people who have Patron pass get  the hunter requisition x2. At least the low EGO rating might have a chance to get some reputation points from completion the daily contracts which are linked to the Expedition in Alcatraz.\n\nPlaying in Expedition is very fun for lots of people.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/224600/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Defiance is something of an anomaly in the MMO space. It is at once massively multiplayer, a third-person Shooter, and an Action-RPG in the vein of Borderlands. Its setting and story are also tied to a Syfy network television show that could markedly increase the game's depth. Defiance is also daring. As the first MMO to launch simultaneously on PC and consoles, it claims a first for the genre. In short, the game ventures into unproven yet well inspired territory. The question, then, is whether Defiance ever actually develops into something unique and worth returning to. The answer is yes but with some caveats.\nYou play the role of an Arkhunter: a souped up, AI-enabled treasure hunter. Your “goal” is to search out alien technology to help return the world to its former, pre-alien invasion state. Very little is explained as the game opens. All you know is that you are returning to Earth on a space freighter and are shot down. But from where and by who? You meet a scientist with an “Ark Core” and he explains that it will help him restore the planet, but how it will do so is left a mystery. When you crash land, the pieces start to come together, but ever so slowly.\nAs you progress through the game's story missions, the shroud begins to lift but it feels drip fed and late. The narrative in Defiance attempts to emulate the bread crumb model of television delivery, flush with mission-based cutscenes and full voice acting, but without background it feels hackneyed.\nOn the surface, Defiance looks much like any other sci-fi shooter. Your travel by foot, ATV, or car, meeting soldiers and survivors in a terra-formed and nearly unrecognizable San Francisco Bay. You kill mutant soldiers and Hellbugs and, if you're anything like me, occasionally take your vehicle on a bit of a tear and launch yourself from hillsides. Then the RPG-inspired and elemental-tinged weapons appear, and you begin to notice the masses of other people chipping away at missions, and the similarities begin to shed.\nDefiance’s two key selling points are its vast array of weaponry and its dynamic content. As you venture through the game, you will come across firearms ranging from pistols to LMGs and grenade launchers. Many of these have special attributes such as damage-over-time modifiers or stuns. The “infector” for instance, is an automatic pistol that causes parasites to burst from fallen enemies. My current favorite, is a shotgun that electrocutes my enemies, snaring them for a few extra blasts.\nArkfalls are the most prominent form of dynamic content. Similar to RIFT's rifts. In these random public events, rocks fall from the sky and waves of enemies swarm forth culminating in a final boss battle. At the end of these, all participants are ranked on a leaderboard and rewarded by contribution. Sometimes Arkfalls come in sets throughout a region requiring that you defeat several in a row. As you venture through the world, you may come across other, more subdued events, such as saving a group of ranchers from raiders or an EMT vehicle from a mutant ambush.\nAt its core, Defiance follows a traditional MMO progression model, notably lacking levels and classes. Completing missions earns experience and money which are then used to upgrade and outfit your character. In lieu of rating players by level, Defiance uses something called an EGO rating with which you unlock perks. In practice this system is simply levels by another name. Players still receive power boosts at regular intervals. Perks can also have a profound impact each player's aptitude on the battlefield.\nDefiance uses engaging episode missions to advance the story. These feature characters from the show with full voice acting and cinematic storytelling. You will infiltrate bunkers, take over cell towers, plant tracking devices to find lost citizens or wipe out Hellbugs that have infested farmer's fields. The missions are varied, entertaining, and make the game worth playing. Side missions are a different story. They are plainly excuses to get you into combat. Often located on the side of the road, you kill mutants or bugs or tag dead bodies. They are disappointingly repetitive and if the shooting model were any worse, I would have called them boring.\nChallenges, however, are unique. These missions are instanced, objective-based, and repeatable with the goal of earning a high score on the leaderboard. Playing well rewards you with experience and money but the real allure is asynchronous competition. Tasks generally require killing enemies against a timer, surviving waves with a special weapon, or racing vehicles through checkpoints. Although fun, challenges seem more like a diversion than a core gameplay feature.\nCompetitive multiplayer works well, even if it is disappointingly sparse. As with many MMOs, there are some balance issues that players have to deal with. Leveling players will naturally be at a disadvantage to those with higher EGO ratings but the differences aren't game-breaking. A skilled beginner could trounce an unawares veteran but at the most basic level, a more experienced player simply has more perks and better gear.\nWhile Defiance nails its most important qualities, it misses others entirely. Trion earns the record of being the first MMO launch to launch simultaneously on three platforms, but in order to accomplish that feat there is an unmistakable feeling that the PC version is an afterthought. There are bugs, missing features, and a user interface that feels cut and pasted from its console edition. To put it in perspective, Trion Worlds is the same company that sold RIFT by trumpeting their vast MMO experience. Even though the development teams are different, this paltry port job is inexcusable from a publisher who has told us, literally, that they know better.\nESC key to open the main menu actually closes the game for some players. The game can be unresponsive or even minimize itself. Core features are missing, such as the ability to take a screenshot or open an actual mission log. Even something as basic as chat is far from functional. Quests glitch, often with NPCs getting stuck on terrain. Enemies spawn in odd, out of the way places. Trion has taken steps to correct some of these issues but many still remain.\nAt its core, Defiance is an exceptionally fun game but its shortcomings can be craterous. Defiance lacks the humor of Borderlands but retains all of the gun-hunting and combat that made that game great but the bugs and interface issues are a problem. Patches will surely address these but that does not take away from the fact that the game suffers for its week-one presentation. Even with the solid core to pick it back up, it may be difficult to convince people to come back. If you can get through its shortcomings, Defiance is well worth a look.","April 3, 2014","true","231.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Trion Worlds is most famous for there other MMO, Rift, however Defiance features a unique blend of open-world combat, free-roaming and large scale boss fights. In terms of weapons, think of Borderlands. Defiance has hundreds if not thousands of different weapons, shields, and more.\n\nThe game also sports a vast collection of vehicles to chose from including a limited edition 2013 Dodge Charger specifically designed for the vast and rugged terrains of Defiance. There is also a huge amount of character creation, including tons of in game armour's along with some purchasable items such as hats, armour's, shields and more. The grind is real, but it's not a big issue in Defiance because the ranking system is fairly balanced and easy to rank up.\n\nI'll admit that the quests are a bit repetitive feeling, but the overall game is very enjoyable and it remains in my top 5 MMO's I have played thus far.","April 9, 2014","true","30.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","1"

Literally only 5 restrictions for free to play members and none of it makes an impact on how you want to play and beat the game. This is a very unique game that adds free missions for each episode of the TV series that comes out adding more content to a game that is packed with missions and sidequest to do. THe game has so much lore and interesting races you want to find out about but leaves you wanting more. Now when this game first came out it didn't have half the content it does now and people that shelled out 60 for it might have felt smited. But the game has come a long way since its release and rewards those who paid for it by getting a bunch of extra goodies that help them progress faster then f2p members. Music and sound is decent but mostly forgettable also voice acting is not very good but some funny lines. This game has hundreds of hours of content that can keep you very busy but alot of the missions might feel the same and repeat a bit along with the daily arkfalls. . Grouping up with your friends is extremely fun and even has a go to friend option never being left behind. Defiance shows up other MMO's that it is possible to have perfect controller support. Community is very friendly and often revives you if near. The PvP is a really interesting concept but can't hold up on this game or its engine due to overpowered wepons and unbalanced ego abilities. Easily the best part about this game is its gun and looting system. There are hundreds maybe thousands of different guns to buy loot find upgrade or even be given to after a mission. With all different stats colors abilities there are so many combinations it's unreal on par with Borderlands. I will actually say the guns here are better then the Borderland series cause the guns actually all look different not just different colors. THey have everything form pistols to infection guns that spawn headcrabs and parasites on enimies. The only thing holding this game back besides its PvP would be the servers. They are constantly adding updates or tweaking things so the servers go wonky often reulting in disconnections, severe glitches, and other characters all looking the same. In the end some of the missions get repetitive server issues often and PvP is lacking. It is defintely a game you should check out and invest a little time into.\n\n\nFinal score 7/10","August 17, 2014","true","86.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

This game makes you team up with complete strangers, whether you like it or not. If you go solo for, say an  Arkfall, you will die. If you go with a dozen people (which is almost guarenteed with Arkfall Sites, especially Major ones), you will have a higher chance.\n\nThis game has little to none glitches and bugs for me. The only one I've encountered is throwing me off my car as it disapears while I'm riding it. Other then that, I haven't found anything.\n\nI am rather picky when it comes to PvE games. I enjoyed PlanetFall until the major update, and then I never looked back. This game, has yet to dissapoint me. With a great storyline, level up system, and weapons, this is one of my favorite PvE games so far.  The Sword is pretty awesome too.\n\nLet's talk about EGO Rating. EGO Rating works so that you earn X ammount of EGO for certain things. Level up? 10 EGO! Finish a pursuit? 5 EGO! etc. This is a rather creative twist to this game. EGO Rating is required to have more Perk slots, loadouts, and to upgrade your EGO Power. This, along with leveling up system, makes this a favorite for me.\n\nLeveling up system you say? This games Leveling up system puts you in a square/rectangle, with one of 4 Ego powers in each corner. The rest is filled with perks. You pick one Ego Power in the beginnning of the game, and if you want another one, you need to build across the grid, grabbing perks until you reach the power of your desire.\n\nLets talk about Arkfalls. Arkfalls are special side missions where you need to do a certain quest. Defeat 3 waves, break a crystal, etc. Then, you get the Arkfall SItes previously mentioned. These put you inside a Arkfall, fighting off enemies. There are 2 Arkfall SItes: Minor and Major. Minor ones send you in, you kill some people and bam! uncommon loot, with a rare chance of rare. However, Major Sites send you into the Arkfall, and going deeper inside to fight a creature. You get much better loot, and a bunch of xp. I have only found 1 Major during my 8 hours of playing, which I consider myself lucky to find. I have, however, particapated in multiple Minor Site raids.\n\nAll in all, this game is absolutely amazing. 17000/10. Make sure to buy it during the Winter Sale, as it is only $5 right now.","December 23, 2013","true","54.3"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/catalyst115/recommended/224600/","catalyst115","Catalyst115","http://steamcommunity.com/id/catalyst115/","82 products in account","I would not reccommend this game as a long term form of entertainment. The storyline is trash. So incredibly bland and uninteresting. You dont benefit at all from playing the storyline missions, either. There is no incentive to do the missions because you get really crappy weapons. Once you get a few good weps, you pretty much learn to ignore everything else.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty robust, but the missions are extremely repetitive. All you do is kill enemies (all of them) or go interact with objects in order to complete missions. Playing with friends makes it fun, but there doesnt seem to be a clear method of actually doing missions together. You can form groups and clans but there isn't much explanation on how to do other group activities.\n\nThe most fun events were the Arkfalls becasue they were so chaotic and so many people were playing at once ( easily 60-80 players at once, with little lag!!). However, there is not much variation with them. They are all pretty much the same.\n\nPvP was put together as an afterthought, it seems. They realized they could re-use all their previously build mechanics and only have to make a few extra TDM and CP maps. Its really not that fun, unfortunately. The Shadow War looked cool, as it allows a 64 vs 64 open world match. Unfortunately, I've never played with more than 20 people at once. The co-op is also very bland.\n\nThe interface of the game is pretty much ported from a console. Buttons look like list items and things that are supposed to be clickable dont look like i can click them.The chat is a joke because a.) nobody really uses it and b.) as a 3rd person shooter, you are shooting and playing the game looking at your crosshair and enemies most of the time. People were trying to get my attention in game and I had no idea because the chat window was completely hidden except for a transparent blue bar. I messed up some missions because I didn't know people were talking to me. Really got under my skin.\n\nAnyway, it actually has a better feel on a console.

For some, the game was lackluster but they enjoyed the three season long TV series. For others, they prefered the game over the show.\n\nEither way, there aren't that many third-person MMO shooters available on the market and the game does a decent job of being one of your options. The way you can group up with others as you're doing a mission or world event and leave to do your own thing, all without having to go through the UI to form parties is nice, and how enemy encounters scale based on the number of surrounding individuals is a good mechanic as well.\n\nThe only thing that'll likely cause new players to have a rocky start is how weapons can have nano effects which allow for more damage based on the type of enemy they're fighting - For example, bio is preferred against enemies with high armor plating while electrical deals the most damage to the shields of an enemy.\n\n\nBesides that, the game is free and can be enjoyed without the DLC. If you choose to get them, you'll have access to a third race, ability to call down arkfalls, and a bunch of minor things that don't really detract from the main game. No harm in giving it a look if you want to shoot things from a different perspective.","February 18","true","194.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

Thee shalt pay much of thine coin!" in this review, then you have not played this game. In my experience, it is a great game, with some okay potential, although this has gone downhill fast. with shallow storylines, uninteresting characters, and an underwhelming "Silicon Valley" update (be aware that that was Trion's BIGGEST UPDATE YET), this is not a game to invest money in.\n\nALTHOUGH!\nThe lore and world, combined with plentiful serious moments make up for all of this. It is an open-world MMORPG. You can always skip the main questline and do what you wish. It can be your own story, with a little grinding. Try to make up a story in your head, and ask for RPers in the Chatbox. You won't regret it, and it can be loads of fun.\n\nALTHOUGH! (again)\nI did not do this. I feel the main storyline is lacking. The only good characters in the beginning easily lose their influence later on. The bad ones, like Cass Ducar, get better toward San Francisco, so just bear in mind that opinion. The show does nothing to complement the story at all. So, I recommend you experience them as seperate franchises.\n\n(And the show becomes a bit of a soap opera, so the game is still better.)\n\nI believe that Trion has lost it's footing completely. They can only keep this game due to a vast amount of product placement by Dodge. SERIOUSLY, WHY THE HECK IS DODGE SO IMPORTANT IN THIS MULTI-FACTION CRISIS? HECK, EVEN THE "MARK OF THE DEFIANT" IS THE DODGE LOGO!\n\nExcuse my rant, but Trion is putting a minimal amount of work into this game. The DLCs are pretty much just a few new vendors. (Excluding Gunslinger Trials, Castithian Charge, and Arkbreaker) You will like it for a while, but I recommend other games for long-term. It functions best as an F2P game.\n\nThe weapon mechanics can be summed up in one quote. DEATH TO ALL PLAYERS -Trion Worlds. You can shoot an enemy in the face 20 times, leaving him with 60% health. Mind = blown. There are no people who do PvE anymore, so you pretty much solo everything. All the enemies have bulletproof faces, so you have to do them one at a time with five other enemies firing at you. The weapons are all horrible. An assault rifle 4 levels below an LMG still does more damage. The tolerable weapons have little ammo, so you need to constantly reload and backtrack 200m just to grab some ammo.\n\nAll in all, this game is a great challenge to skilled gamers such as myself and everyone that can stand this game. There are really no reasons to keep playing other than that. I'm moving on to another game.\n\nSincerely,\nYour Supreme Presidente,\nMechawomp","August 26, 2014","false","32.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

I will say that I would give the game play IDEA 3 out of 10 stars. For the fact they actually came up with some unieq idea's such as EGO instead of normal levels as in other games...\n\nAs for being called Defiance. I honestly dont think it should be. Besides calling chars Casithans, Volge's and Irathients. The game has nothing else really of the tv show like Defiance. For one being the TOWN called DEFIANCE. Thats what the show is based on not random parts of Cali. The game "Defiance" Does not even offer  the race of Omec's which was the show ending race with Nolan going off into deep space to let the Omec's start a new world.\n\nNow onto the more down sides. The game is full of glitches, Things not completing when you finish missions, or not counting all the credits towards things you finish. Or missions like Incursions just becoming stuck with no way of getting it back going because of enemies just vanishing off down into the ground where you cant get them. With all the glitches of the game I ignored them till getting to the point where I was doing Incursions over and over and over with them only getting stuck and not getting credited for them..\n\nThe game Devs also offer NO SUPPORT on this. Acting as if their customs on the game would have no clue how game files and such works. I personally worked for Ubi Soft, Hasbro interactive, Micrsoft, AMD, and other companies. I know Each and every game has PLAYER FILES. Which sets the player up each and everytime they login. Showing what they have. Their levels (or ego in this game) What they have, and have not completed, so forth and so on. Below Ill be posting some copy paste from a "support ticket" that I had with Trion about some glitches from not being able to finish some persutes for their glitches. Also keep in mind as you read this ticket, Im a player that has spent nearly, if not more than a full grand on this game. This is what HIGH PAYING players get for support.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(02:40:11 PM) Alissa LeNoir: Hello Im doing incursions in Defiance and Im standing in one now that I fully cleared out and its broken and wont start the next wave. I get this daily non stop. I have done enough of them to have my persutes fully completed. Can I get comped these persutes for these technical issues ?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGM Stormlock Today at 11:37\nHello,\n\nThank you for contacting us regarding Defiance.\n\nI apologize for any frustration the Incursions may be causing.

Since this reply clearly shows you all think the customers are stupid and not worth helping. :) Pretty sure you can see how much has been spent on my account.\n\nand you can close this. Ill also be putting this entire thing up on steam reviews. Game glitches and devs claim they cant edit a player file which all games have, acting as if the people paying their pockets are to stupid to realize how games work.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGM Stormlock Today at 12:10\nHello,\n\nThank you for contacting us regarding Defiance.\n\nI am sorry to see you feel the way you do an hope you change your mind and choose to remain a member of the Defiance community.

The gameplay is good enough to finish the base storyline of the game, but the story itself is forgettable.

I stated so in a discussion post on Steam when someone asked if they should buy some premium content.  Although I stated it as an opinion, for many players that has been a FACT.  My post was removed and replaced by a suggestion on what to buy response from a dev, and I was banned from the forum.  The show was cancelled by SyFy.  A show that was supposed to tie into the game and vice versa.  That gave me little hope for the future of the game, one of which I had a passing interest in revisiting.  However, the game alone is mediocre at best.  Not the worst thing I have ever invested time in, but it gets repetitive real quick.  My feelings on this are my own, but I know they are similar sentiments that are shared with many others.  And I'm definitely off-put by the dev bullying.  That has never been right, and never will be.  I will never touch another Trion game again.","March 14","false","38.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","0"

If you hated Borderlands, you still might want to give this a try because it has everything that Borderlands lacks.\nDefiance is a post apocalyptic game where humans and aliens try to live in peace on a Earth that has been so vastly changed by terraforming and everything isn't completely made of tin roofs and signs. You play as an ArkHunter and your main job is to complete missions for NPCs. You can also do side missions and challenges, they are fairly fun but do get repetitive after a bit. There are also missions called ArkFalls, a gaint crystal falls from the sky and either mutants or Hellbugs are around it. After the typical 3 waves of badies are gone collect all the goodies on the ground and stuff your inventory. Its a pretty decent challenge if you play alone but its much more fun and a bit more difficult if you play with a huge group of players.\nIf you'd like to play with a friend, its so easy to team up! I always play games where I co-op and i gotta say, this was extremely easy to connect to. For me, there is very little waiting time for things and smaller areas to load. The game play is pretty smooth although it can glitch up a bit (a main mission's enemies wouldnt appear once for us but it did come back the next day).\nI find the controls to be very smooth and very easy to move around. Even the driving is pretty smooth, on the road at least! you can take your vehicles off-road and its one heck of a ride. There are some ramps and cut off roads that are awesome to jump off of. Just be careful of rocks and road blocks, you'll either get stuck or explode and be ejected from you vehicle into a horde of badies.\nThe guns aim well and are easy to control but it can be overwhelming trying to find the right gun for yourself and applying mods.\nOften times you'll have more weapons and grenades than you'll know what to do with. Its a bit confusing and a lot of trial and error and you will have to sell a lot of items but at least you make a lot of ingame money. Although you can buy things with real world money i really didn't see the need to spend money on in game stuff.\nThis game is so much fun and for the price, i feel very satisfied and to me it is very worth the money (mine was a gift though, thanks Vader!).  I usually never write reviews to games but this one truly deserves to be reconized for its great game play, good story and the amount of hours you'll spend on it.","February 16, 2014","true","22.4"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","2"

Graphics are clear enough and gameplay is easy. There are however some issues like not being able to log in, getting kicked out, game crashes but i kinda expect that these days with any online game as none are perfect, Do you have to watch the tv series before playing? i would say it helps if you want to follow the story and understand but not really important if you just want a fun online shooter with some friends. All in all despite its problems i would say its not a bad buy for the price and on sale well worth it and hopefully the developers will keep supporting this game for as long as possible as with good support it could be excellent.

Yet his approach as "light" genre, its component PvP fluid and natural, the sheer size of the map and his not wanting to be social at all costs make a title for this rather atypical and interesting. With a graphical more polished, less bugs and a better AI, it would be able to pursue even more ambitious goals.","May 10, 2015","true","95.4"," 48 of 90 people (53%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","53","48","90","8","0"

I have tried many games at this point and have seen them run the gambit.  Defiance contains the polish and content that is worth your time.  I played for many hours before opting to reward the developers with some of my cash.  Note is was not necessary for gameplay or needed for progression.  Defiance has an interesting story line that piqued my curiosity enough for me to check out a few episodes of Defiance on Amazon Prime, and plan on continuing to watch.  It is my understanding that there are codes given out at the end of each episode for free in games items.  These rewards are only given out during an active season and as we are in between seasons I am NOT able to verify this but am hopeful.  The game does not really hold your hand and the community is small so expect to have to figure some game play mechanics on your own.  I encountered some minor lag issues and quest bugs but I have not anything that is completely broken.  All in all this is one of the better Free to Play MMO’s out there.

I really wanted to like this game. I was pumped when the whole thing was announced. A sci fi MMO that ties in with a TV show?! Brilliant! What a great idea!  I tried, lord did I try, I even brought a few friends in who didn't last nearly as long as I did.\n\nIt only shows 0.5 hours played for me, but that's probably cause I uninstalled and reinstalled a couple times. I'v certainly put more than 100 hours into this. Probably closer to 200.\n\nI don't have anything to point out that others haven't already. The game is repetitive and lacks anything original. It sucked me in at first, but once the questlines run out, you're basically just driving around the map looking for group events, a lot of the time, by the time you get there the group is finishing up and you missed out on most of the good action.\n\nIt's really not awful, it's just not a game you're gonna sink 300+ hours into. The reviews say mostly positive, but if you're looking for a game that's gonna hold your attention for a while.

It seems that they are more focusing in giving a copy/paste response and blame the developers which by the way will never give you any kind of response for any in game generated bug report. So basically there's no feedback if your issue is going to get resolved or not, One thing that I would like to rescue out of this game is the forums community which seems to be really strong and has more lore than what you could acquire with their developers or CS reps.\nNow as a closing, all this game experience leave me with a bitter taste.

I was EXCEPTIONALLY skeptical of this game and tried the free trial thinking I would hate it, and end up uninstalling it. I had just uninstalled Neverwinter, a title run by the same company that made another mmorpg. They used allot of elements in their first mmorpg (Star Trek) in Neverwinter and it felt so bad and horribly cloned I could not stand it. In TRION's Defiance, I was very worried I would be playing RIFT like character models. However, it was NOT the case. I was very surprised at how smooth the character was moving around and how engaging the story was. There are cutscenes and an over all story arc that pulls you into the world and makes it feel living.\nThere is an opening cutscene very egaging and interesting to watch. It ties in fluidly to introduce your character and put you right into the mmorpg open world. This is a hard concept most developers CANNOT pull off. If you read my Neverwinter review, you would see how I was so dissapointed that the game has a great system of cinematics mixed with in game gameplay for the first 5 levels, then abruptly cuts off and leaves you with rinse and repeat quest hubs and over all compelling story. In fact, most games are like this. Or you do a bunch of meangless tasks to hit that one point in the game that unlocks a small video file to show you what is going. But it feels awaward at best and interuptive and more of a "reward" for reaching this point in the game.\nIn defiance, this is not the case. The movie starts and then the action and what happens next and how the movie cuts in the game is SUPER fluid with everything you interact with. I was so impressed with how this made up the world that as an FPS and as an MMORPG this out performed almost all games I have been testing over the years. Especially the F2P... I am just blown away at the quality and detail used to create the "I am here, and have a mission, and it is important" feel of the game. The publisher uses NPCs that mix right in with the cinematic scenes. It is very generous to give the story telling in a smooth, interesting, and over all pleasing game play experience.\nWhen not doing the main story arc missions, you will run across "side quests" or live events happening all over the living world. You have open world littered with buildings and forest and encampments well entrenched. There is no stretch of land not used to it's potential to create the living world. As you travel you can pick up these side quests and help some fellow troops pinned down in a persistant battle. You can help link up to a computer system or enter a gun fight  to give aid to your fellow man in arms. These are the "visible" side quests on the map. There are allot of activities and war far events that are popping up off the radar that make you stop pathing to your quest and end up fully engaged in an entire other aspect of the game. I often found myself heading to my quest objective marked on the map, only to run across my people pinned down by gun fire asking for help. As soon as I enter the live zone the objectives are displayed...perhaps other players are already inside progressing and I am much needed back up as an extra gun...You see, that is GREAT co-op mmorpg features that bring people together! A live, persistent world always doing things that, if done together (or solo) will reward and not feel meaningless.\nAs an MMORPG this game shines! It also has arc falls that bring people together for mini raid battles. EXACTLY like in RIFT. This is a meteor like thing that drops from the sky and you have to kill off the enemies waves, and then strategically shoot at weak points in the crystal. The more people doing it the better and it was not surprising to get into a group of 20 easy. There are several mission types and enough things to do to keep replay ability at a high.\n\nI did say "a meteor like thing" because I have no idea what the TV show has explained about these. As a player who never watches the series I was a little lost in the dialog at times. They talk about how it is bad these aliens are doing things or this technology does this or that...I was totally lost. But it is clear that you are human. Earth was attacked. Technology was to blame. And it is now your mission to help the resistant movement or something rather. So the story is given out on a need to know easy to take in basis. And honestly, I like it! It is interesting, engaging, and works perfectly to get us moving along the path. No "You are hero fighting for wealth and kingdom" bull crap. A real cinematic and game play experience to push this fantasy world forward. If I had on negative point, it is that in character creation, you have a choice of voice for your avatar, yet he rests silent in the cut scenes. It also is not DEEP as other mmorpgs as far as crafting and getting lost in menus and micro managing your stats all over the place. But it gives you just enough to be deep and thought out.\n\nThe skill system for example. YOu pick what kind of soldier you want to be and form this out through skills. You start on a grid and start with a choice of 4 points to start branching out in. Stealth, speed, damage, defense skills etc... I chose a cloak that makes me hide from enemiesrefills my shield for about 5 seconds. After I chose this base skill, all the other skills around it unlocked and I Start building out. I can give bonus to critic damage by crouching. OR chose bonus dmg to enemies rushing you...So you start to see, if you are a fighter that likes to hang back and crouch behind a object, you can build this kind of character to suit your game play.\nIf you like to snipe, you can get scopped bonuses. If you like to rush it you can get bonuses to that. The developers logically and awesomely built the skills and game around letting you fight how you want. I have tried so many FPS and you have to do one thing or the other, and in general all game play is the same. In this, you are complimented to play at your rhythm, style, and nature.","February 4, 2014","true","130.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The game has been out for over a year according to wiki but this game has tons of bugs with 4 DLC with a 5th suppose to be released.\n\nThe game mechanics are broken in that since you're actually required to shoot the mobs, the mobs love to teleport due to glitches. Kinda hard to hit mobs when they teleport around. You carry limited ammo and if you choose sniping, you will quickly find yourself out of ammo or praying that you take down the mob in 4-5 head shots(not kidding about the amount of headshots). Instances are not bound by walls so if you were to get knocked over anytype of short barriers and into the water, you will die or spend 10 minutes getting back into the area if you are able to get up the shore.\n\nThe community is worse in that nobody really communicates in this game other than if you are in a clan. You are limited to only type in chat when you are at the main play screen, not the loadout menu or any other menu. You can't skip cutsceens and will repeat cutsceeens regardless of the amount of times you are redoing an instance.\n\nThere is no actual player class. That is the only good thing going for this game except good luck getting a great weapon for the style you want to play. Some of the other weapons are broken and will not even damage mobs on explosion.","July 26, 2014","false","7.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

The storyline starts off well, but I felt somewhat cut off from what exactly was going on.  I progressed, I participated in collective, massive battles of 50-100 people, I participated in the instance levels that came with the game.  It is definitely an TPS and it works well for the shooting part.\n\nHowever, if you haven't watched the show this is based upon, then you will definitely lose out.  I have not watched the show, and I barely knew what exactly was going on.  The military was involved somehow, and the sidequests made very little sense.  Some of the missions were super difficult for 1 player in story mode.  And I was armed to the teeth with grenades and assault rifles.  What really ticked me off is that I would kill enemies in my story instance, use up all my grenades doing so, one person survives and kills me off.  What happens?  The story instance restarts with all the enemies coming back alive to full health and ammo.  Except I have no grenades and no ammo.  Every time I had to restart, the story instance would restart and I would not.  This happened many times, and eventually I was spending an hour on a simple mission, because I had to kill every enemy all over with next to no ammo and grenades.\n\nThe massive battles were interesting, but there were no rewards other than shared xp (amongst a hundred people).  Also turns out I can explore the whole map at any level, and there is literally nothing that interested me landmark wise.  Everything is almost the same everywhere.  The skills were decently thought out, and the skills as well as the lack of lag and graphical distortion were really the only positives for me.\n\nDon't get me wrong, if you enjoy TPS and you have a few other friends who like 'em and you wanna just fool around in an MMO with guns, then maybe this could be a game to do so in.  But it loses it's fun very fast.  In my personal opinion, it was not worth the buy.","November 27, 2013","false","13.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Here are some things below that I think need changing...\n\nBug Fixes\nFIXED >> * When you restore functionality to each secondary radio tower (KTAM East, West, South) you fall from the sky after the cutscene.\n* Sometimes, bullets don't hit targets. (Especially noticeable with manual sniper rifles.)\n* Sometimes, shots that should be missed, hit.\n\nThings to Improve\n* Textures. They look okay for mid-HD range, but not high-end HD (1080p+) range where they can have washed out edges, etc.\n* The sun. It's basically a blurry blob when at the edges of the horizon.\n* Render Distance of players and enemies. I don't like how enemies and players look like they're slo-mo / lagging at large distances. That said, sniper rifles are useless when trying to see enemies far off, because the render distance for entities is so low.\n* Culling. Get rid of it.\n* Enemy AI Line of sight. It pains me to note that cloaking gets rid of aggro, yet going behind buildings doesn't reduce aggro when alone at all. Come on guys, we aren't Minecraft.\n\nThings to add\n* Unique skills / etc. for each class chosen. For instance, the machinist could have an activated skill that places a dispenser of sorts similar to that of Team Fortress 2 so that players don't have to go all the way to the nearest ammo refill point. Veterans could have a passive that makes them better at LMG spread (more accuracy) without the need for perks.\n* An auction house system to trade directly from scrip to bits and vice versa. As well as an auction house to bid / buy out items / mods, etc. The AH would be a stand-alone EGO via a holographic emitter of sorts in each major NPC village (including the starting one near the crash site.)\n* An explicit mod attachment tutorial.","April 23, 2013","false","33.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/volt615/recommended/224600/","volt615","Volt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/volt615/","405 products in account","DefianceI really like playing this game! Defiance is now a free to play game so no investment other than your time is needed to play and enjoy this game.  I initially purchased Defiance while looking for something new to play with my family.  I did not have any expectations for this game and had never seen the Scify TV series, but I was surprised to see that even my wife liked it and she normally will not play a shooter, even if it is an MMORPG.\n\nGame DesignDefiance has a lot of good design features with it like dungeon/pvp grouping tools as well as a limitless questing network.  The game uses a feature for looting similar to Rift, also a TRION Worlds game, in that you do not have to be grouped to receive loot from a kill.  The game uses Rift's rift (outdoor raid) feature but calls them ark falls.  The game also uses a system that allows players to play with others at any level and still receive xp and loot.  This is a double side coin that can make game play feel very repetitive.\n\nThe leveling prgress in the game are not your typical 1-50 levels.  In defiance you level to 5000, although I do not believe it takes any longer than the more traditional level design of 1-50.  With your levels you get points to develope your character's talents/trates/perks. Unlike other MMORPGs, Definace does little to specialize classes/races.  Other than the Castithan race which gets to use a dagger/sword melee weapon, there is nothing special about picking the race or class at the beginning of the game.\n\nStoryDefiance's lore runs hand in hand with the popular TV series on the Syfy network.  The game and TV show writters/developers work with each other to make sure what one does, the other does as well. They even went as far a putting in a gamer's character into the show after holding a contest to pick the lucky gamer.\n\nThe GoodI really like the control and gameplay.  The loots system is great.  When doing an event or quest the item rewards are based on your level, not the zone.  The grouping system works very well for PvE and PvP.  The game is interwoven with the TV series.\n\nThe BadGraphically, the character models could look better.  The game engine is last gen.  Because the NPCs adjust to the level appropriate for the gamer so to speak, the game feels repetitive even when completing new quests. And last, there is no class specialization or specialized class missions so there is no value in leveling more than one character which limits replay value.\n\nConclusionDo I recommend it?  Absolutely!  It is a fun game that is now free to play so you have nothing to lose but the time investment of trying something new.\n\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=295084872","July 30, 2013","true","99.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RunawayDanish/recommended/224600/","RunawayDanish","RunawayDanish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RunawayDanish/","148 products in account","Defiance is a Third Person Shooter action game with MMO elements. It features some fairly well done combat mechanics (namely, moving and shooting is pretty robust) and a full campaign. I've probably burned around 85 hours on it by now, and have a pretty high level character.\nThat being said, Defiance has a lot of problems that I can elaborate on.\n\n1. Combat: The game can go from laughably easy to incredibly hard based on the drop of a hat. Wide, open free roaming environments can lead to long range combat to reach an objective, but then upon reaching the objective enemies spawn in point blank.  The shooting elements handle well, the enemy types can be fairly diverse, but with the exception of the very powerful Volge enemy types (think, large metal roboguys who can almost 4 shot you near the beginning of the game) enemies are kind of weak unless in very large numbers. The AI has some predetermined behaviors that are easy to learn and counter for, and occasionally you'll have a lot of fun fighting off multiple enemies at a time. However, the difficulty scales very inconsistently, often going from cakewalk to instant death depending on the location and mission.\n\n2. Single Player Elements: Campaign missions are not consistent in their difficulty nor are they especially interesting after having done one of the four possible types of mission. These types essentially are "Go here and push a button, kill the guys, repeat", "Go here and shoot some guys, grab a thing and come back", "Go here and do this repeatable quest" and "Go here and do a minidungeon". The single player parts also offer a plot involving an "Ark Core" or whatever said plot-driver is and a few characters who are generic and underbuilt. Final boss is a refreshing dose of difficulty, but is both too little and too late to make a huge impact.\n\n3. Multiplayer Elements: Coop and Competitive multiplay exist in Defiance. Coop modes have Dungeons and more Organic repeatable missions that reset periodically in the world. That being said, Coop tends to be incredibly easy for essentially the vast majority of the game's possible playable parts- save for one AND ONLY ONE segment- the Major Ark Fall that is called down by players buying a purchasable item through the Defiance store. This Major Ark Fall event features significant quantities of per-player scaling robobaddies ready to screw you up. That being said, the Major Ark Fall calldown is only difficult for its final boss, which is something of a behemoth of incredibly frustrating AoE attacks and is basically unkillable for the most part (unless, say, an entire clan of orginized players goes after it with a very specific technique). Competitive multiplay is by queued instance only, it seems, although there is a "Shadow War" pvp event which I have never seen in action. Multiplayer has some balance issues due to the weapon generation systems, currently (01.11.2014) there is a sniper rifle that can charge up its shot, and break appart the shot into individual shots (making a sniper with a tight shotgun like spread). This "Surge Bolter" style of rifle is incredibly overpowered at this point, due to a balance patch that made all Semi-Automatic rifles do more damage than previously. I figure this weapon is probably bad for multiplayer just because it can 1 or 2 shot people really frequently and has no accuracy modifier caused by movement/standing/jumping.\n\n4. Logistics: The menus are awful, but navigatable if you learn how they work like I did. That being said, they desperately need some serious revisions especially in the Item Comparison department (which is currently, essentially broken). The modification section of the menus, known as the "Salvage Forge" is used to modify weaponry to make them have extra magazine size, a scope, ect, as well as to reset the "Weapon Mastry" points on a weapon, to make it able to level up player weapon skill despite having been used a lot by the player. The player to player interactions are also somewhat flawed, the "Quick Menu" features multiple types of functions that CANNOT BE ACCESSED ANYWHERE ELSE. This basically means that the radial escape menu and the various player menus regarding character are all disconnected from Adding friends, joining a clan, ect.\n\n5. Overall Opinion: Say, a 1 point game is something like Full Spectrum Warrior (an unworkable piece of garbage), a 5 is say Dead Space 2 (Working, but lacking significantly in some serious aspects regarding player experience) and a 10 is closer to Half Life 2 (arguably one of the best experiences gameplay wise in my opinion); Defiance is a whimpy 4/10 because of many reasons stated above, and some others I haven't gotten to. I really, really love third person shooter games, and this one in particular captured my attention with the decent combat mechanics and the layers of possible depth (unlockables, however, are all that are left by this point), but lost me because of failure to carry through an enjoyable experience. I still had fun with this game, but often only because of shooting a badguy in some kind of impressive way (see: 360 no scope with that overpowered sniper rifle I talked about), or laughing at my friends when we could make the game's party functions work for us. If it goes on sale for 5 bucks, I recommend trying it out if you're really into the Borderlands style of game (respawns, MMO format, active weapon play, decent combat mechanics) but I strongly suggest bringing some FRIENDS or you will probably never be able to justify the ~18gb of this games overall size.","January 11, 2014","false","122.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It is a 3rd Person MMORPG which ties into the tv show of the same name. I enjoy it as it has an open world to explore, story missions, episode missions, arkfall events, competitive and co-op modes. The weapons are quite varied but they don't scale with level, although rarity can make a big difference, You pick an ego power but basically level up various perks. So a low level can balance against a high level. I find it fun and it reminds me a bit of Warhammer online, which was another under-rated game.

In fact, now that it's free to play, it's worth spending a weekend in. The hybrid skill system allows for a diversity of play styles that its direct counterpart Borderlands lacks, first of all-- the prevalence of the "Re-Spec" button and its relative cheapness means that it's worth experiencing the game from all four skills. The game has lots of spontaneous quests that can give more meaning to the world than going from point A to point B.\n\nAs far as gameplay, it's basically Borderlands trying to take itself seriously. That means a couple things: more serious story, for one, which isn't necessarily bad, but is really quite average. The guns are more bland as well, to fit the 'seriousness', which in turn makes gameplay more, well, average. Defiance is a game that suffers not from any fatal flaws but from being only okay at everything it does. It gets dull because there are no highs and lows, only flat lines.\n\nThis is a great game to spend some ten hours on, sure, but after that progression becomes so slow and encounters so repetitive that it's better to simply uninstall.","July 27, 2014","false","6.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

It's more of a co-op multiplayer shooter than an MMOFPS. If you wanted MMO features, I can only tell you that these are in small numbers and pretty much bare bones. If you wanted your classic MMO just with shooter features, you will be sorely disappointed.\n\nThe "quests" aren't taken from NPCs in towns (there aren't even any towns, just some peaceful areas amongst the battlefield that is the rest of the map) but they are spread across the map and they're always about activating some things or killing enemies or both. Thing is these quests become very quickly very repetitive and boring. Also, you can do the same quest multiple times as enemies will respawn rather fast after you completed it (which, imo, is very lame and breaking the immersion). The game is FILLED with visual glitches, such as players disappearing from in front of you and reappearing, which looks quite bad when you got a lot of players blinking as you approach them.\n\nThis game is pretty mediocre for our time.

Unfortunately, the release of new content has been slow, and the game feels like a long grind of arkfall's and other events. To be fair I haven't played it in the last year or so, but I will say from everything I have read it hasn't changed a lot since then. It really will be a toss up if you like it or not. Some will like it because of the show, or because they like shooting and blowing bad guys up, others will hate it because it is a grind or has a limited amount of new content.","April 17, 2015","true","804.9"," 22 of 42 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","22","42","2","0"

The real rating should be around an 84. Defiance (in my mind) sounded too good to be true, and also since movie/TV show tie-ins usually suck i wasnt counting on defiance being as good as it acctually is. The shooting is solid. Maybe not the best in the world but its still up there with most third person shooters. The story, although "meh", has some pretty good characters. The voice acting is usually on par with the characters but could have been done a bit better. The amount of guns in the game is amazing! It's almost borderlands MMO style and finding new guns to use is never a hard task. Either way you look at it defiance (though rough in some areas) shines in a sea of TPS MMO's.

If you enjoy an open world, free roam, multi-mission, mmo, rpg style, guns, pvp, coop, welllllll daaang! The list will keep on going. To me this game is like Firefall/Warframe. A mix of Borderlands classic looks for vehicles, armors, and weapons. Ark Falls as you level up prove more challenging and drop goods from beginning to the end of every battle. The game seems to go with your pace of leveling. So however you play in any game, will reflect on how quickly you level, gain awesome mods, weapons and more. Along with areas showing more side missions than you know what to do with. Group up with 1 to many people or run like a lone wolf. You like racing? Alone? This game has it... putting you up against the world of players on the leaderboards. PVP your style? Defiance has got it! Mind you this game has its bugs, quirks and lag points. Like with any game you find yourself immerced in an open world of gliches and lag spikes along with a rich world of never ending adventures! So with that, hope to see y'all on the battlefields of Defiance! ~D (Admiral Hawke - Defiance)(Now, NSI-DiabolicaHawke, Founder of NSI Nothing Stops Insanity)","November 15, 2013","true","271.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is one of those games.\n\nThis MMO is set in the future. Humanity was forced to have literal illegal aliens migrate to their planet and technology greatly prospered. But however, there is one faction that is like so damn xenophobic. It is the Dark Matter. Dark Matter are these cool looking space xenophobes who make up the alien races that came from the collection of illegals.\n\nHonestly, I think my favorite MMO villains are the Dark Matter. Plus, they have giant robots.\n\nPros:\n\nPvP is easy as hell. Just get a radioactive SMG and a grenade launcher. I once got this amazing score by blowing up almost the entire enemy force. They all cloaked and for some reason decided to go in this corridor where I was. I had the sneaking suspicion that I was being looked at so I fired a couple of grenades and detonated them. Got a couple of kills so I proceeded to then just blow the HELL out of that corridor and got more kills. Explosion simulator 10/10\n\nThe enemies are pretty cool. First we have cybernetic miners who for some reason are very hostile. Next we have mutants. The mutants are a huge threat. They seek to invade D6 like their communist brethern. Woops, wrong game but still...they're pretty much a threat. And finally, we have these giant space armored guys who for some reason remind me of something that I can't even think about. Oh, right! They remind me of the Combine Empire. We also have these space robots who basically robotify you from inside-out. Scary as hell.\n\n\nCons:\n\nThe Loot System has some problems. For some odd reason the game reminds us of Borderlands yet there isn't any notice-able gun variety.\n\nThe quests are very dull at a certain point.\n\nReputations are easy/hard to acquire for some reason to me.\n\nMy 100% organically grown oranges disapprove of the cons. Ergo, it is a con.\n\nThe Final Verdict:\n\nThis game has that weird attraction. It most likely will attract you back if you think about it.\n\nAnyways, this game is recommended if you just want to have fun. Believe me if you will, this game is as easy as cooking Meth in PAYDAY 2.","July 23, 2015","true","63.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I managed to pick it up on Steam Summer Sale for 50% off.  It gets -slightly- repetitive while levelling, but no where near as much as most MMO / Grindfests.  It mixes MMO / 3rd-Person Shooter exceptionally well, and it doesn't try to force you to work with people (you can run through the entire storyline solo).  It's multiplayer offers several different modes of PvP combat, Co-Op missions, and a Rift-Like system called "Arks".  You are an Ark-Hunter, after all, and choosing to  help your fellow players in these big (sometimes massive) battles is rewarding both visually and inventorily.\n\nAlso, Vehicles!  In an mmo.  Summonable, like mounts, but vehicles!  And they act properly like vehicles.  That's almost a miracle.\n\nAll of that said, this game is still pretty easy to put down.  Despite everything I like about it, I don't think I would be nearly as happy with the game if I had paid full price.  For everything it does that is unique, there are 2 other things copy and pasted from previous MMO's.  I suppose that's to be expected.\n\nThe characters can be a little dry at times, but the storyline is solid.  Character creation is GREAT for a FPS, and Lacking for an MMO.\n\nBuy it if it's on sale.  It's worth it.  I don't recommend paying full price.","July 25, 2013","true","31.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The leveling empowerment is slow and small, falling in the players hands to shape the character and gear for the progression.\nProblems in this launch are the unfriendly UI at some parts (specially the contract feature that have a MAJOR part in gearing) and the not very smart graphic processing, that creates stuttering in older CPUs, giving prority to superfluos things as background elements decoration and animation, over obstacle, player, and enemy models.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maldiablo/recommended/224600/","maldiablo","Ed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maldiablo/","527 products in account","I figure I'll add to the positive reviews and outline good features others missed.\n\nMy friends and I all play and level up at different paces.  In every other MMO that's a big problem because eventually level differences mean you can no longer play together or further advanced players have to replay crap to help the lower level friends level up.  I usually stop playing an MMO once I no longer have any friends who are at a level I can party with and they generally do the same.  It gets real boring playing with strangers you have no intention in forming any meaningful relationships with so I generally avoid that.  This game solves that delimma by temporarily boosting lower level players to just a small margin of difference of the highest level players in a group.  Lower level players will have more of a challenge, but will not find it impossible as they would in other MMOs.\n\nWherever you go, the enemy mobs are dynamically adjusted to match the level of the highest player in the area, that combined with the low level players getting boosted means everybody everywhere has to play with skill, and can't just blow through everything with overpowered weapons.  Since leveling up unlocks perks, skills, rewards and generally more powerful weapons, it's still very much worth leveling up in spite of the auto-balancing.\n\nWhile there is no in-game system for quest sharing, you can still accompany anybody doing a quest that you've already done before and see the cut scenes again and at least get the exp.  The game has no problems with both players doing the same exact quest at the same time though, you just have to make sure all players manually start it.  Again, it will still be a challenge for all no matter what your level or what the level gap between party members.\n\nThis feature also fixes another problem many MMOs have.  A lot of people like myself tend to explore and side-quest.  In so many MMOs, I would explore so much that by the time I got back on a main story mission, it would be boring and unchallenging due to how much stronger my character was over the requirements for that quest.  This game ensures you can play however you want and not be punished by unchallenging quests whenever you finally get to them.\n\nThe game has a cash shop built in that existed even before free to play.  This was due to the fact that there was never a monthly fee for this game.  You only had to buy the client.  Now the client is free and that's the only thing that's changed.  People tend to fear that a game going to the f2p model ruins it, but this game was already sort of free to play.  It just had an entry fee that was recently waived.  I can only see that as a huge plus.  The cash shop tends to sell a few perks, but nothing that I've seen to give the players an unfair advantage against the environment or other players.  Just things like faster leveling, more inventory, nicer looking vehicles, alternate costumes and random item crates.  The random item crates may be pushing it, but they never give paying players anything that regular players can't obtain and since it's a gamble that may yield crappy results, I don't see players with deep pockets abusing it that much to any sort of advantage.\n\nAnother thing for me would be to speak to the DLC aspect.  It turns out that most of the DLC items can be obtained and used by players that don't even own the DLC if you're lucky enough to get one from a tier 4 lockbox (obtainable in game without spending real cash).  Also, when a DLC purchaser unlocks a DLC area in the overworld (ie: calling down an arkfall), even non-DLC players can enter.  There just won't be any any DLC drops in there for those players.  Only normal drops.\n\nOh yeah, did I forget to mention drops are instanced?  Well they are.  Nobody ever has to fight over goodies again.  It also ensures drops match the level of the player so everybody gets something useful to them.\n\nWhat does all of this add up to?  The creators of this game basically created a balanced way for all players to partake in any of the game's very challenging, rewarding, and extremely fun random events that happen in the overworld.  It's extremely common to go to the site of a major arkfall and find about 50 to 150 other players teaming up to hold off a hoard of monsters or defat a major boss.  There's no need for a instancing system or queueing system thanks to the auto-balancing which just keeps things so fluid it's crazy.\n\nIt never fails to be fun.","June 16, 2014","true","72.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Without the pay for power items the difficulty level is just too hard.  Tons of swarming enemies and weak firepower just make this game an incredibly frustration experience.  If you don't buy the best gear you will ALWAYS be over matched.  The game has other issues but the sheer difficulty of the special encounters is just to hard without paying for the good gear.\n\nAlso, and probably worse in a design way, is that you can do the quests/missions out of order.  You do one mission where something has already happened then later you do the mission where it happens.  It makes following teh story rather confusing as you go along.","April 28, 2014","false","27.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tyknu/recommended/224600/","tyknu","Tyknu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tyknu/","200 products in account","Let me start off by saying that Defiance gets more of a bad wrap than it deserves. Let me just get the negatives out of the way first. It's true the game is far from perfect, and there are better MMOs out there. It's also true that it is basically a watered-down Borderlands. With the upcoming switch to f2p for the game, as a Deluxe Edition early buyer, I'm more than a bit disappointed, and I feel that loyal players deserve more than what Trion is giving them after this change. It's sad that after already having to buy things in the cash shop from the very beginning, the players that paid 60 dollars for the game still aren't getting completely compensated when all they are giving them are a few extra inventory slots and a few character slots. Character slots should be unlimited for those that bought the game in my opinion, and the game needs to increase its inventory slots overall, because the number you were given pretty much made you want to buy the expansion in the cash shop long before the game went f2p. Now that I got that out of the way and off my chest, I will tell you why this game is very dear to my heart.\n\nThe TV show is extremely entertaining and is a great show. The events from the game that tie into the show make you feel like you are part of the world's history, and that is a good thing. Furthermore, it is rare to find an MMO with a storyline, and this game does this extremely well using cutscenes. Defiance isn't genre defining, but it's definitely a fresh take on the gameplay from Borderlands, as the first game to be connected with an on-going summer TV series. It's kind of fun to have an MMO version of Borderlands, which I always felt like Borderlands felt like an MMO without players. The game has had a few glitches here-and-there, but nothing really game-breaking has ever occured in the many-many hours I've spent playing this game. The characters in this game are charming and memorable, which is more than you could say for the characters in the vast majority of MMOs. The cutscenes allow characters to express personality, and the voice actors do a good job of breathing life into the NPCs. As far as MMOs go, I could see if the hate towards this game was because of the always-existing cash shop, but most of the hate seems to be directed at the gameplay. The gameplay is not bad, it just needs a tad bit more polish. This game is worth giving a chance. While it may not be for everyone, enough players have fallen in love with the game's charm to allow it to survive this long despite the struggle to keep players interested. The TV show is doing fairly well, and hopefully by going f2p, this will allow people to experience the game and see what has charmed so many people into sticking with a game that often gets more negative reviews than it deserves. The game sets out what it intended to do for the most part, but as of right now, there are no incentives to play as the other races, so hopefully specialty missions will be added in the future. If you only intend to play through the story of the game, you have nothing to lose. It isn't a bad game, and deserves more love than it gets.","May 14, 2014","true","61.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a pretty good game altogether, but not my taste. I prefer shooters where cover and headshots really impact the game, but this game does neither. Sure, headshots give double damage, but the enemy still needs 30 shots to go down. I can see how many people would like this game, but I personally don't. I'm giving it a positive review because I think it's very solid, good lore, good enemies, nice variety of weapons, impressive online experience (playing with others actually increases enjoyability, which is rare in mmo shooters nowadays), massive world to explore and a pleasing visual art style. I dislike it personally due to a lack of direction at the beginning, as I came for a mount promotion from another game, and I dislike how the interactions with npc work (stale animations, almost no cutscenes, straightup lame characters at times) and having a hard time to find places for me to level have made this game a bit cringy to me.

It's a pretty good game altogether, but not my taste. I prefer shooters where cover and headshots really impact the game, but this game does neither. Sure, headshots give double damage, but the enemy still needs 30 shots to go down. I can see how many people would like this game, but I personally don't. I'm giving it a positive review because I think it's very solid, good lore, good enemies, nice variety of weapons, impressive online experience (playing with others actually increases enjoyability, which is rare in mmo shooters nowadays), massive world to explore and a pleasing visual art style. I dislike it personally due to a lack of direction at the beginning, as I came for a mount promotion from another game, and I dislike how the interactions with npc work (stale animations, almost no cutscenes, straightup lame characters at times) and having a hard time to find places for me to level have made this game a bit cringy to me. I advice you to play it nontheless, because I think people could enjoy this enough to sink a quick 300 hours into it.","March 8","true","3.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I understand that events are meant to be done with other players, but even the main story missions become ludicrously hard in SEASON 2. Just...why? WHY did the make the game so hard that it REQUIRES friends? WHY did they make it so you can't get away from enemies due to lack of cover? WHY did they make the game a ball of rage? I don't know, but I wouldn't recommend the game unless you like extremely hard third-person shooters. This brings me to think that, despite the game having what I thought was a good start and good base ideas, it just brings too much fury into the combat to make it fun.\nRating: 5/10 Average","September 27, 2014","false","8.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I don't recommend spending any money on it.\n\nRage mode activated:\n\nOne of the worst games I've ever played, and I'm serious. I played this before it was on steam/free to play. It's bad. Repetitive. However this isn't very different from other MMOs.\n\nHands down THE worst human anatomy on the 3d models. At the university where I graduated as a designer, they would've failed these guys with their "humanoids". Please, study anatomy before you model a human being. Or at least look in the mirror.\n\nWhat's worse than the 3d models, you ask? I'll tell you. The animation. The running animation especially, in a game where 90% of the time you're running, you would expect the animators to put more than 5 minutes into it. That is not how a human being runs. That is not how any being runs.\n\nNow onwards to the actual game mechanics... there is nothing new to see here.\n\nDamage system? Well, they have a skeletal damage system. No, actually, I think it's just extra damage for headshots. However you will still need to pull off 3-5 headshots on eve the weakest mobs to kill them. It's really unrealistic. 3-5-15 headshots for some monster, alien from outer space, Keith Richards? SURE! But you are shooting other humans. With sniper rifles. Point blank. IN the head. Ridiculous.\n\nSome say the scenery is great... well, I do like the roads and the fact that you get a pretty decent vehicle mechanics, which makes me think these devs should've made a racing game instead. And when I say decent vehicle mechanics, I mean marginally fun, not at all realistic or that make any sense.\n\nI could go on but you can try for yourself because it's free to play now. At least they got that right, it's free. Because some peopel paid for it before and they were ♥♥♥♥♥♥.","August 4, 2014","false","9.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Wouldn't say the story line is the best, however if you are looking for a casual game to play with some friends that just want to run around and kill giant monsters with a large number of other players, this is the game for you. However if you are looking for a game to be the one MMO you play for a long time you may want to look elsewhere as sometimes the game gets fairly repetetive by doing alot of Arkfalls. They seem to release new content fairly often as well.

The co-op is very easy to get into and if you want to play on your own you can but it’s just as easy to join other players to clear some missions.\n\nThe environment in Defiance is beautiful and even with fast travel available I mostly only use it to sell/buy things at the shops because driving around is just so much fun to do with all the jumps, hills, cliffs and a stunning environment that you just never know what you’ll run into, and sometimes that just happens to be the face of a mutant while your speeding off a cliff at 90 miles per hour. Ark falls are a lot of fun to do, and most of the time for the bigger ark falls there is about 40 people vs a giant monster, it’s almost like a rave party except one with bullets, lasers beams, and explosives, and afterwards everyone gets to go home with an big bag full of goodies and sometimes even some rare item drops.\n\nDefiance really reminds me of borderlands in some ways, and in many ways I've enjoyed it more than borderlands 2 personally. Defiance is really like a combination of Borderlands, Mass Effect, and some kind of amazing off road racing game. Defiance doesn’t really give us anything new, ground breaking, or revolutionary but it does deliver a solid top notch game and will provide you with many hours of entertainment. If you haven’t given the game a chance yet, go for it, it’s only 9$ and it’s a lot of fun. Although defiance is really fun, it isn’t perfect and does its fair share of bugs and glitches like this one glitch were I couldn’t finish a mission no matter how many time I tried to redo it, until the next day I was able to complete it without an issue, With that said don’t be scared off or be too worried as that is a rare occurrence and most of the time corrects itself so you can avoid giving birth to an elephant in extreme rage and go off chaseing some arkfalls or play some other missions untill its avalible.\n\nPros:\n\n-	It only costs 9$ and with no subscription fee\n-	Amazing Co-Op (or Solo gaming if that’s your thing)\n-	Replay ability\n-	Beautiful environment\n-	Good Story\n-	Driving mechanics and vehicles\n-	Smooth Gameplay\n-	Cinematics and voice over are well done for an MMO\n-	Open world\n\nCons:\n\n-	The odd Bugs and glitches\n-	Could use more instruction for new players at times\n-	Pick up’s can be a bit over whelming for new players\n-	No ability to store items\n-	Repetition\n\nOver all on a scale from 1 to 10 I would give the game 8.5 Out of 10.\n","February 16, 2014","true","27.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fisknoll/recommended/224600/","fisknoll","fisk0","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fisknoll/","1783 products in account","A decent multiplayer third person shooter, somewhat reminiscent of Borderlands in terms of the skill system and loot. The MMO aspect isn't something you'll see a lot of, many missions are instanced and most competitive PvP stuff puts the players on separate maps.\nThe story is, somewhat surprisingly considering it's based on a TV show, not particularly intriguing, the mission get somewhat stale after a while, but the setting - the overgrown United States after a failed alien terraforming attempt, is interesting in concept. As game mechanics go, it's solid for the genre, and it does get pretty cool when you team up with a bunch of other players to take on the timed world events. The player base has started waning at this point though, and other than the major arkfall events you'll rarely come across any larger crowds. At this point I would not recommend the DLC, they just barely provide what was promised in the season pass description, mostly coming down to a few new weapon types and missions, all taking place at the already existing land mass from the core game. Unless the specific weapon types in the DLC description seem to suit your preferred play style (I did like the charge weapons added with the first DLC), you'll probably not get much out of them.\nAs for the game itself, it's not charging a subscription, and I haven't found the need to use any of the stuff available in the microtransaction store (which mostly boil down to limited time XP gains, random weapon packs - which are very easy to get with the in-game currency - and some costumes), it's pretty solid at what it tries to do, but not as ambitious as you would hope hearing the talk about an MMO third person shooter. At the asked price point I think the base game is definitely worth it, but I'd hold off on the DLC until a sale.","April 1, 2014","true","46.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Due to the many different rolls on weapons there is a low chance to receive your ideal weapon.\n\nThere is never enough information presented to the player and the UI is clearly designed for consoles. Several of the graphical options are limited in order to work on consoles. The chat system was patched to work several months after launch.

The running and walking and even driving feels like its a grid, nothing is smooth and fluid. I can see why it went from thousands of players down to 400, it just lost its fun factor because of that and many reasons.\n\nI wouldnt recommend because how it feels when playing, it was cool in the begining but quickly lost its fun factor and would hate for others to buy the game, but lose interest in it from fixable things.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MechSmith/recommended/224600/","MechSmith","{ιяα} MechSmith","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MechSmith/","169 products in account","TLDR: This game is basically a more serious, online version of borderlands, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Its free so it's definitely worth the time to download and have a play around.\n\nThe main problem i have with the game could be summed up by a description of one fight. I was doing a story mission, running around a ranch shooting raiders. so far so good. I then saw a miniboss on a nearby rooftop, so i pull out my sniper rifle, and shoot him in the head. his health bar stays the same but the damage readout says 4000 damage. i empty the rest of the clip into his head. not only is he still standing, his health bar is almost full. So, skip to the sixtieth headshot i get on him, and i've run out of ammo. i pull out a light machine gun and close in. five hundred rounds later, he's at 60% health. i'm not quite out of ammo but he has been spamming grenades all around me and now there's nowhere for me to go that doesn't have a detonating grenade. i get one-shot and go into bleedout. i revive myself and run behind a building.i see an ammo crate, refill my ammo, and ~150 headshots later he dies.\n\nSo my problem is that enemies are far too bulletsponge-y. A basic, unarmoured bandit, with no helmet, will often take two, three or four headshots from a sniper rifle, or dozens of point blank headshots from an assault rifle, SMG, LMG etc.\n\nThis, combined with the fact that enemies will just keep spawning faster than you can fill them with bullets means tht the gunplay is a bit of a letdown. quite a big problem, as a lot of mission objectives involve 'interact with this object for five seconds without taking damage' objetcives, meaning you either cheese it with cloak, or you spend 5-10 minutes in the same area just mindlessly killing the same enemies over and over again until you've got a five second window. Fast-spawning mobs would be fine, if they died quickly. bulletsponges would be fine if they were finite, which wouldn't really work in an MMO. sadly, this means that you can snipe everyone in an area, walk up to the objective and find that there was really no point because the enemies have respawned already and you're stuck in the same close quarters battle anyway.\n\nAside from that, it is a good game. the fact it was originally not free to play means that the microtransactions aren't built in from the ground up to be 'necessary', vehicles are actually vehicles, not mounts, and you can do some fun stuff with the jet-booster quadbike you get half an hour into the game","January 26, 2015","true","43.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

You aren't trapped to one weapon.\n- The main ability u pick seems to unequip after you learn it, so hit L and click on it and look for an equip button on the bottem of the screen.\n- Main abilities seem to dictate playstyles, don't pick cloak if you want to be brute force.\n- Playstyle meaning things related to that will be selectable perks.\n- The Main abilities are Stealth/Killing power ranged/Misdirection and Movement killing power melee. There are melee enemies that will get up in your face so the last one certainly is a valid playstyle.\n\nIt's fun and fast gameplay and it's free.","September 5, 2015","true","11.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","1"

Almost right away you get a ride! Free to roam everywhere. Great concept!\n\nThe bad: Unfortunately not as great of a scenario campaign, and open world doesn't add much to a railroad script. Everything is competitive so cooperation isn't really encouraged. You would think twice about deploying damage booster in a middle of a crowd of other players, because it gives +100% damage to everyone within it's radius. Bonuses/items received at the end of the mission are based on what you placed in a ladder of everyone who attempted that mission with you.\n\nThe ugly: would not recommend.

The creatures you fight are constantly changing. There's so much action going on in this game, you'll be on you way to the next mission in the main story and pass straight through an arkfall and two episode missions, it's pretty cool. You can always just drop what you're doing and help people out with the missions that they're on if you really wanted to. It's completely open world and there are so many different weapons and perks.

After going through an easy tutorial you are open to roam a large open-world on a vehicle you can spawn out of thin air, then come across random multiplayer events, like going through waves of enemies protecting an 'Ark', with other people (very epic). I especially LOVE the combat and gameplay, it is SOOO satisfying, for example:  Snipe a dude, throw a grenade, blow up an explosive barrel with enimies around it, then pull out a machine gun and go crazy while rolling inbetween corridors. Also the enviroments are AMAZING! like the Golden Gate bridge all broken and old, and i like the fact that what you see... YOU CAN EXPLORE! The graphics and story are also amazing for a F2P game and not to mention the game is completely FREE, and in my opinion it is Not Pay-to-Win either, YES you can by the coins that let you buy ingame items, but you can get the coins yourself and buy and sell using IN-game currency. Did not pay a Cent of real money. The ONLY downside is the servers are down alot and occasionally the server lags, but... WHO CARES?

The game feels like they took the combat stylish gameplay from mass effect added in a borderlands looting system. And then to top it off gave it the overall feel of star wars the old republics MMO feel. The game is much more fun if you play with a friend and keep at the same pace.  To me the game is a little confusing at first. Gameplay / Mission wise if you didnt play from launch. (Because the game is alinned with the TV show defience and is added on with each season. ) it almost feels as if you just dont connect as well with the game.\nStory wise the game is very weak i probably would understand it more if i watched the show but i just dont want to put the time into the series quiet yet. And another part i felt about the gae that hits the story hard is that almost all the characters voice acting sounds like the producers walked outside found some random hobo and said they would pay for his meal if he did one or two voices.\nAnother thing i must add is character customization is there just minimal.  just dont expect a level of cuztomization like skyrim or SWTOR.\nBTW the game is much more fun if you play with a friend.\nSo really all in all despite a couple bugs (None game breaking) its a solid MMO/RPG to the genre. And since its free now theres no reason not to check it out. Defiance is a ton of fun and can give you a great time.

I have two main reasons for that:\n1) Mechanics are always pretty much the same, point, click, skill hotkey, etc etc\n2) Fantasy-Japanese-Medieval-Magic theme over and over again, with silly storyes and sexist characters.\n\nDefiance has neither of them. Althought it shares common aspects of any other MMO, this game has a good controller suport, to start with.\nI know it's not the first MMO shooter, but it delivers pretty well in that aspect, it vaguely reminds me of a MAss Effect X Borderlands feeling.\n\nNow, the game has several problems, like being almost constantly laggish, enemyes have questionable AI and interfaces are quite confusing at the start.\nBut somehow this game got me coming back at it.\n\nAnother good thing is that I find myself useful in every event. In other games, as you join up early and powerless, your useless, but here I find myself on the top 5 players every time.\nAnd that´s another great thing, now that it's free. Almost any event or just anywere you're going you'll end up having a lot of other players helping you out (by helping themselves out), and no argument and crying around about sharing the loot.\n\nStory here is not great, but is quite engaging. Quests are a little repetitive (go somewhere, shoot enemyes, activate something), but it has kept me hooked.\n\nI've never spent real money buying items for the games, but I might give it a try on this one, just to support it.","August 1, 2014","true","56.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I think Defiance is a fantastic, amazing AAA game. I have no idea why the Metascore is so low, but I'm guessing it's because there was a hype machine associated with it both online and on television (SyFy) due to the fact that this game was produced alongside the TV series, and such hype machines tend to go overboard. There's a lot of action, some decent RPG elements, a decent shooter mechanic, AMAZING graphics, MMO scope, multiple storylines, and a changing world. It's not without occasional glitches, such as missions that don't complete correctly, but it's still a great game.

In that respect it's been a fun few hours.\n\nIf I had to describe the game it's Mass Effect meets Destiny meets fallout with some RIFT style random events you get caught up in. Playstyle is very much like mass effect, it's third person offset camera, with basic run and roll / dodge but lacking the cover system. The way you run around dispatching enemies in various environments and zones reminds me of playing mass effect vs destiny, the hud animations when you collect items and interact are similar too.\n\nThere are quite a few similarities to Destiny whilst on that note. So if you are looking for a sci-fi fix of that type then take a look at this. I think Bungy had quite a bit of inspiration from this. I played Destiny from beta and release, leveled up a Hunter to 30 with all legendary and exotics, did all instances / strikes and put in a hell of a lot of playtime (then got bored and sold it along with the PS4) so I have seen all of it.\n\nThe environments the art style and post-apocolyptic battle of Defiance much like the (rather poorly explained) battle of the traveller and environments. Certain mobs look very much like the Knights and others (and raiders look nearly identical to some of the enemies on earth, mutants with swords charging at you very similar in idea to the vandals concept).\n\nScenery is of a very similar style, certain outfits and gear look similar, the HP system and hail-of-bullet style play and mob encounters are similar too. Even down to the rocket / thrust system on mounts and the way mounts are summoned and an AI 'ghost' style entity guiding you. I have the cloak ability and building on other specs similar to the hunter style play. There are certain things it does better too, like the fact that it IS open world, and not just some crappy restricted zone or 'patrol' style small planet map. The actual social aspect that was heavily lacking in destiny is in Defiance. I could actually see me getting more play time from this.\n\nI'm not sure of the longevity of this game at the moment, there is a very big map and several continents to explore, I have travelled to quite a few zones already but I am still discovering places, I feel the combat may get a little tiring, but there are plenty of weapons and a lot of modifications that you can do to them (you can modify the stock, barrel, scope and ammo / magazine type).\n\nThere are a ton of micro-transactions, the store has a lot of gear you can purchase, but they have to make some money somehow since it's gone F2P right? The servers won't run themselves! I haven't found yet however that I need to buy anything, quests do the standard MMO thing and reward gear, be it weapons, outfits or shields / mods, so there is plenty to keep you going while you assess whether you really do like the game or not. And if you like it, why not buy a weapon or outfit, it's cheaper than a pint of beer...\n\nSome good and bad points so far:\n\n\n+ Graphics are very pleasent - nice effects, nice level of detail and terrain looks very good, models look good too\n\n+ Well designed environments\n\n+ High FPS - even on highest settings performance seems very good, never dropped bellow 60fps once, even with about 100 players on the screen in a total frag-fest\n\n+ LOTS of action - if you like unleashing a hail of bullets and projectiles into enemies you will enjoy it\n\n+ Lots of gear - Weapons, modifications and equipment available even without buying from the store\n\n+ Zero server and connection lag experienced thus far\n\n+ Good sound FX\n\n+ Open world - no real set path, do anything you want and at your own pace\n\n+ No leveling system - as such, this is a postive I believe, new players can instantly join in with veterans and have fun\n\n+ Skill trees with lots of progression\n\n+ If your into the series, this links in nicely and has episodic content that carries over to the game\n\n+ Fast travel if you want to get somewhere in a hurry\n\n\n\n- Widescreen users may experience 'vanishing' textures and objects on high settings - after some play time (memory leak?) although the game still looks great on medium and this problem will go away\n\n- Story is a bit bland - not very well explained, not engrosing or that interesting in game\n\n- Music - gets very annoying after a while, the combat music is limited to one track that really gets on your nerves, at least you can turn it off\n\n- Some enemies have way too much hp - and not in a good way, IE in certain quests the mob won't kill you, you won't be worried at all but you will roll around shooting him for about 10 mins getting very bored with his never ending HP!\n\n\nOverall if you have a few spare minutes, are bored and fancy just trying something new, then for free it is really worth a shot.","December 7, 2014","true","19.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

Draw distance is horrible for pc players or anyone who enjoys sniping at long distances, you get invisible enemies after 100-150 meters. (PS3 and xbox360) Pc players could always look at the options and choose options that suits their systems.\n2.  Not that much graphical options...\n3.  Gameplay gets repetetive after 13-16 hours.\n4. Market. This just sucks. You can actually buy lockboxes from there, those contain weapons and other misc. items. Sometimes this game feels like Pay to Win...\n5. If there is too many enemies in one area you will only see the enemies and not the players... Makes it kinda hard for medics. For example one event there was about 40-60 players and suddenly there was only me against 40-50 enemies that suddenly lose health and die.","December 15, 2014","true","234.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Wide variety of weapon choices, intruiging bosses, and its a show also! The money system (scrip) isn't that hard to get, and there is a good trade system between players and stores. The 5 different rarity levels go like this: White=Common, Green=Uncommon, Blue=Rare, Purple=Epic, and Orange is legendary! And if you want to edit your gun, you can! With Defiance's Salvage Matrix, you can change your weapon in a variety of ways: If the weapon has an EGO level above or below your's by 100, you can use ArkForge to level up/down any item. You can also change your gun's mods, which consist of barrel mods (ex. Power Bore ll), Magazine Mods (ex. Radiation Converter IV), Sight Mods (ex. Telescopic Sight V), and Stock Mods (ex. Close Quarters Stock I). All of these mods also have rarity levels (white, green, blue, purple, orange). Sometimes, guns don't come with all the mod slots. In order to fix this, you must have to click "Add Mods" on the Ark Salvage screen. But beware, not all mods are for the same weapons. Defiance also has a PvP system, but it can sometimes be hectic. There are Shadow Wars and Competitve Maps. The reason I personally don't do PvP is because (a) The people are VERY good and (b) The weapons and abilities can be over powered. With that out of the way, let me talk to you about the feel of the shooting. I can't really tell you the word to describe Defiance's shooting system.................aha, it's perfect! Yeah, in my opinion, The shooting in this game is great. (ex. I am using a semi-automatic sniper rifle and I shoot. I can see the bullet trail leading to were I just was. ex. I mod my current Light-Machine gun with a Inciendary Magazine; the bullet's come out red and sometimes will light enemies on fire. And if you don't care about PvP, Defiance has a very fun Multiplayer. All in all, the only thing I really don't care for in Defiance, is the slightly bad PvP and (unfortunately) not the best graphics. What I mean by this, is that when you zoom in on a other players with a scope, you will see a blurry mess. I would recommend Defiance to anyone who likes video games.\n\n","January 1, 2015","true","44.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","5"

I Bought it on the Winter sale for $4.99  and with over 30 hours in I certainly have gotten my money out of it.  That said the Server is Dead, when I look at how many people are in the game at one time on steam the most I have ever seen is 700 people.  That is really sad for an MMO.  I just play the game like it is a single player game and that is how I get my enjoyment out of it.  I would like to do more Like PVP battlegrounds, but I was in the queue over 3 hours last night just to get 8 more people to PVP.  I want to invest in the DLC, but I am afraid that this game is going to end up shutting down do to low populations.\n\nThe point is I do recommend the game as it has good game play but don't expect to see to many people at once.  I would like to see more people get into this game as I think it is a little under rated and does have good gameplay to it.  I would also hate to see it go away, because unfortunately that is where I see it heading with the empty servers.","January 29, 2014","true","41.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Then you add episodic missions with some of the same decent characters from the show and events that explain other events, such as where Nolan gets a particular artifact, and in one mission you technically save the city of Defiance. The game also has a nice long story line mostly independent of the show, fascinating in its own right. The game and show stand on their own no question, but if you follow both they cross over in fantastic ways and further illuminate the world.\n\nControls and combat are solid, what you would expect from a typical 3rd person action shooter, notably with unlimited dodge rolls but without a cover mechanic. The progression is also very nice, with a wide variety of weapons with not much difference between them, instead progressing by skill and based on how you can mod the weapons and how the weapons and mods synergize. There are also 4 core abilities and a plethora of "perks" to unlock, upgrade, and slot. You choose 1 scifi ability and 3+ perks, unlocking slots over time. One of the best features is you can set up different loadouts, with weapon, ability, perk, and even outfit and vehicle choices set per loadout. It is fairly quick to switch loadouts, and you can in combat (pve), though there is no hotkey to switch yet.\n\nThe game is an mmo and has the necessary elements, clans, chat, friends, etc, but is light on other elements. You can only have a single mission at a time, though they are more engrossing than typical mmo quests by far; it will not cross your mind a second time. The chat is minimalist, but they have announced an overhaul. It is, in a way, a barebones mmo, but a very excellent coop 3rd person action shooter. Yes, there are also some bugs, but none of them terrible now, they are almost always easily ignored.","July 22, 2013","true","138.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

That's the biggest thing in a nutshell.  MMOs generally have that vibe about them that says, "Here's a skill bar, pick some powers and use them as needed."  But Defiance doesn't do that.  It's more, "Here's a gun, go kill some stuff."  I love that.  Borderlands of course comes to mind, but it's not really an MMO.  The closest thing I can think of that even got close was Hellgate London[hellgate.t3fun.com], and that game sucked.  But why did it suck?  Why does Defiance not suck?  The difference was that Hellgate gave you guns, sniper rifles, and so on, but accuracy didn't matter.  If you shot the enemy right in the face, it still did it's calculation vs. your accuracy level to see if you made the hit.  That drove me berserk to no end.  Defiance isn't like that AT ALL.  If you have the skill, if you can hit a target, YOU HIT YOUR TARGET.  This single feature above everything else defies anything bad about the game.  It is truly a single player feeling game on a multiplayer environment.  Never once have a shot a bullet and lag caused me to miss.  NEVER.  This is why Defiance is the best shooter MMO that has ever been released, that defies the rules of MMO bringing people who hate the traditional MMO experience back into the fold.

The DLC's all bring about 1 good thing to table while the rest is neglible.\n\nCastithan charge pack - The charge blades from the TV show, new weapons, and arena mode. Blades are cool. Weapons suck. Arena...meh.\n\nArkbreaker - ability to call down arkfalls and access to volge weaponry. Both of these are nice. New stuff to do in game and access to great weapons. Downside/upside (depending on your viewpoint) now everyone is essentially running around with a baby BFG from doom.\n\n7th Legion - new faction, new outfits, titles, and weapons. Bad DLC. Been playing for a bit and still not seeing the big deal. I guess the samurai outfit just doesn't impress me that much. :-(\n\nGunslinger - "new" storyline missions and similar goodies listed in 7th legion DLC. The "new" missions are really half of the old missions with a new/more detailed background to them. The DLC starts out interesting enough, but trails off at the end. PvP and CO-OP maps redone for single player use. This is all it really amounts to. The story isn't really progressed all that much. You find out a tad more about e-rep and (!!!SPOILERS!!!) they are trying to be devious and underhanded and steal stuff. Surprised? Not really. Impressed. Not really. Overall rating of this DLC...B- to a C+\n\n\nOverall the barebones game will get you far. If you want to get the DLC pick up the first two. Everything after doesn't really contribute. Still not sure?

The combat often come up frustrating in spades. While 99% of the combat is ranged the enemies have some very good melee dudes that really are good at getting in your face and busting your chops. Unfortunately switching between your long range and short range weapons while a mutant is axing your balls a question can be tedious. Combat suffers from the ranged melee model that most MMOs of this ilk use. You and your oppnent stand 50m apart and blast each other until someone dies. Cover is useless and while you can crouch down I don't see what is does other than making you impossible to hit or hit anything when behind a wall.\nSo over all has alot of good stuff like free ammo (Tabula Rasa: you are in the army but you have to buy your own ammo) nice vehicles, involving missions, emmersive world, there is much that sales this game untill you have to fight and then it can, not always, but often enough, falls on your head.","January 5, 2014","false","27.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cplpinkamenapie/recommended/224600/","cplpinkamenapie","CPL Pinkamena Pie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cplpinkamenapie/","1217 products in account","Picked this game up for about $4 on sale and I must say, I've definitely got my money's worth from it with about 114 hours worth of gameplay at the time of writing this review.\n\nThis game plays out very much like an online Borderlands, for better or for worst. The game play is a pretty straight forward with a basic run and gun core gameplay. There are a wide variety of weapon types to choose from, allowing players the ability to customize their character exactly how they like them with no real restrictions as to what weapons can be used by which class or race. There are also a host of abilities that can be used to aid in breaking up the monotony of the run and gun format, much like Borderlands, but often times I have found that they are not essential to game progression. The world is large and feels adequately inhabited, with a number of random missions going on at all corners of the map at any given time. The map itself is gorgeous, with a fair amount of variety from region to region. There are also a number of different gamemodes available to offer a little variety with the world. Everything from time trials on ATV, to special events where you battle progressively more challenging enemies, to multiplayer PVP.\n\nAnd now for the drawbacks. Because the game has the same gameplay mechanics as Borderlands, it can get very monotonous. For the most part, this is counterbalanced by a wide variety of weapons which offer different challenges when fighting enemies, but still the format of running around shooting enemies over and over can get boring. While there are a number of different random missions that crop up all across the map, giving you the opportunity to get additional money, the missions fall into only a few different categories and after a few hours of gameplay, will become less interesting and more of an annoyance due to the lack of variety. Another disappointing aspect is that while the weapon types are varied, the number of available weapons of each type are not so much. There is no real variety to the weapons themselves, unlike Borderlands. In Borderlands, if you found a specific weapon you liked, you could search for additional variants of the same type that offer additional perks or slightly varied stats. In Defiance, once you find a weapon you like, you're pretty much stuck with that same weapon. The only possible choices you have is to find some mods to give it a few additional stat bumps or find the same exact weapon in a more rare version for a few tacked on perks. There's no real variety and aside from personal preference, no obvious reason to choose on weapon over another. Finally, my last gripe is with the PVP... PVP can be a bit glitchy at times. Sometimes when you go to join PVP, its supposed to teleport you to the area where the PVP is going on, but it doesn't, leaving you to commit suicide to fast travel to PVP since often times its a few kilometers away. I've also seen the respawn screen glitch and not allow you to respawn. I waited nearly 10 minutes, with the sounds of the battle continuing in the background. The buttons would respond on mouse over and when clicked, but it would not allow me to respawn. I ended up having to restart the game to clear this fault.\n\nOverall, for a pretty fun casual Borderland-esque game, I feel that it is worth the money, especially if you pick it up during a sale, but be warned that a lack of variety can make this game feel a little monotonous, especially on longer play sessions. Also, I hear that the game is a lot more fun if you drag along a few friends... I'd rate this game a solid 4.5 out of 5, since really only a few minor tweaks to the game could definitely improve the overall play value...","November 26, 2013","true","141.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Defiance is basicly an open world shooter based on a tv series.\nThe game has an unique way of playing co-op where anyone at any time can join your quests and help you. The leveling in this game is also pretty unique where you don't actually have a level but you gain XP to spend on skill points. Gear does not have a level requierment so a low level could easily match up against a high level in PvP.\nThe graphics are not the best out there right now but do have it's own feel to them.\nThe vehicles in the game have a pretty good feeling to them, the sound of the vehicles could be redone though.\nNot a lot of character customization or armors in this game and the cool cosmetic items cost real world money.\nThe game has a lot of areas and envoirments to explore and a lot of fun quests to do alone or with friends.\nI can recommend this game mainly because it gives a lot of fun for small coin, and with no actual subscription as in you pay once and you can play forever makes this game a good purchase.","November 27, 2013","true","12.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That's the biggest thing in a nutshell.  MMOs generally have that vibe about them that says, "Here's a skill bar, pick some powers and use them as needed."  But Defiance doesn't do that.  It's more, "Here's a gun, go kill some stuff."  I love that.  Borderlands of course comes to mind, but it's not really an MMO.  The closest thing I can think of that even got close was Hellgate London[hellgate.t3fun.com], and that game sucked.  But why did it suck?  Why does Defiance not suck?  The difference was that Hellgate gave you guns, sniper rifles, and so on, but accuracy didn't matter.  If you shot the enemy right in the face, it still did it's calculation vs. your accuracy level to see if you made the hit.  That drove me berserk to no end.  Defiance isn't like that AT ALL.  If you have the skill, if you can hit a target, YOU HIT YOUR TARGET.  This single feature above everything else defies anything bad about the game.  It is truly a single player feeling game on a multiplayer environment.  Never once have a shot a bullet and lag caused me to miss.  NEVER.  This is why Defiance is the best shooter MMO that has ever been released, that defies the rules of MMO bringing people who hate the traditional MMO experience back into the fold.

It's kinda like borderlands styled co-op with MMO at the same time, you'll meet a LOT of new people and fight to compete in arkfalls, volge sieges, and considerably more. The leveling system is very slow in relation of start/max level (10/5000, I'm around 1500 now) and such is often also the case with finding new weapons, but the game does have updates, plenty is subject to change (they certainly have room to improve). Again, not the greatest game, but if you've got 10 to spend and want a new game to hang with friends in, this is a pretty good idea.","September 28, 2013","true","260.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In that respect it's been a fun few hours.\n\nIf I had to describe the game it's Mass Effect meets Destiny meets fallout with some RIFT style random events you get caught up in. Playstyle is very much like mass effect, it's third person offset camera, with basic run and roll / dodge but lacking the cover system. The way you run around dispatching enemies in various environments and zones reminds me of playing mass effect vs destiny, the hud animations when you collect items and interact are similar too.\n\nThere are quite a few similarities to Destiny whilst on that note. So if you are looking for a sci-fi fix of that type then take a look at this. I think Bungy had quite a bit of inspiration from this. I played Destiny from beta and release, leveled up a Hunter to 30 with all legendary and exotics, did all instances / strikes and put in a hell of a lot of playtime (then got bored and sold it along with the PS4) so I have seen all of it.\n\nThe environments the art style and post-apocolyptic battle of Defiance much like the (rather poorly explained) battle of the traveller and environments. Certain mobs look very much like the Knights and others (and raiders look nearly identical to some of the enemies on earth, mutants with swords charging at you very similar in idea to the vandals concept).\n\nScenery is of a very similar style, certain outfits and gear look similar, the HP system and hail-of-bullet style play and mob encounters are similar too. Even down to the rocket / thrust system on mounts and the way mounts are summoned and an AI 'ghost' style entity guiding you. I have the cloak ability and building on other specs similar to the hunter style play. There are certain things it does better too, like the fact that it IS open world, and not just some crappy restricted zone or 'patrol' style small planet map. The actual social aspect that was heavily lacking in destiny is in Defiance. I could actually see me getting more play time from this.\n\nI'm not sure of the longevity of this game at the moment, there is a very big map and several continents to explore, I have travelled to quite a few zones already but I am still discovering places, I feel the combat may get a little tiring, but there are plenty of weapons and a lot of modifications that you can do to them (you can modify the stock, barrel, scope and ammo / magazine type).\n\nThere are a ton of micro-transactions, the store has a lot of gear you can purchase, but they have to make some money somehow since it's gone F2P right? The servers won't run themselves! I haven't found yet however that I need to buy anything, quests do the standard MMO thing and reward gear, be it weapons, outfits or shields / mods, so there is plenty to keep you going while you assess whether you really do like the game or not. And if you like it, why not buy a weapon or outfit, it's cheaper than a pint of beer...\n\nSome good and bad points so far:\n\n\n+ Graphics are very pleasent - nice effects, nice level of detail and terrain looks very good, models look good too\n\n+ Well designed environments\n\n+ High FPS - even on highest settings performance seems very good, never dropped bellow 60fps once, even with about 100 players on the screen in a total frag-fest\n\n+ LOTS of action - if you like unleashing a hail of bullets and projectiles into enemies you will enjoy it\n\n+ Lots of gear - Weapons, modifications and equipment available even without buying from the store\n\n+ Zero server and connection lag experienced thus far\n\n+ Good sound FX\n\n+ Open world - no real set path, do anything you want and at your own pace\n\n+ No leveling system - as such, this is a postive I believe, new players can instantly join in with veterans and have fun\n\n+ Skill trees with lots of progression\n\n+ If your into the series, this links in nicely and has episodic content that carries over to the game\n\n+ Fast travel if you want to get somewhere in a hurry\n\n\n\n- Widescreen users may experience 'vanishing' textures and objects on high settings - after some play time (memory leak?) although the game still looks great on medium and this problem will go away\n\n- Story is a bit bland - not very well explained, not engrosing or that interesting in game\n\n- Music - gets very annoying after a while, the combat music is limited to one track that really gets on your nerves, at least you can turn it off\n\n- Some enemies have way too much hp - and not in a good way, IE in certain quests the mob won't kill you, you won't be worried at all but you will roll around shooting him for about 10 mins getting very bored with his never ending HP!\n\n\nOverall if you have a few spare minutes, are bored and fancy just trying something new, then for free it is really worth a shot.","December 7, 2014","true","19.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

Alot of players.\n2. Very enjoyable gameplay. (exept sniper)\n3. Dynamic events.\n4. Challenges,contracts,missions everything i love in a game.\n5. GUNS, LOTS AND LOTS of guns, one for every mind.\n6. Loot system is quite good. (There is an in-game market, where you can buy lockboxes that contain weapons and other misc. items)\n\nCons.\n\n1. Draw distance is horrible for pc players or anyone who enjoys sniping at long distances, you get invisible enemies after 100-150 meters. (PS3 and xbox360) Pc players could always look at the options and choose options that suits their systems.\n2.  Not that much graphical options...\n3.  Gameplay gets repetetive after 13-16 hours.\n4. Market. This just sucks. You can actually buy lockboxes from there, those contain weapons and other misc. items. Sometimes this game feels like Pay to Win...\n5. If there is too many enemies in one area you will only see the enemies and not the players... Makes it kinda hard for medics.

After going through an easy tutorial you are open to roam a large open-world on a vehicle you can spawn out of thin air, then come across random multiplayer events, like going through waves of enemies protecting an 'Ark', with other people (very epic). I especially LOVE the combat and gameplay, it is SOOO satisfying, for example:  Snipe a dude, throw a grenade, blow up an explosive barrel with enimies around it, then pull out a machine gun and go crazy while rolling inbetween corridors. Also the enviroments are AMAZING! like the Golden Gate bridge all broken and old, and i like the fact that what you see... YOU CAN EXPLORE! The graphics and story are also amazing for a F2P game and not to mention the game is completely FREE, and in my opinion it is Not Pay-to-Win either, YES you can by the coins that let you buy ingame items, but you can get the coins yourself and buy and sell using IN-game currency. Did not pay a Cent of real money. The ONLY downside is the servers are down alot and occasionally the server lags, but... WHO CARES? I Love this game, i made this review when i have played only 4 hours of the game and it is already my top 10 games list..... just try it out! *also, the TV show is complete and utter CRAP*","August 13, 2014","true","5.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

The game feels like they took the combat stylish gameplay from mass effect added in a borderlands looting system. And then to top it off gave it the overall feel of star wars the old republics MMO feel. The game is much more fun if you play with a friend and keep at the same pace.  To me the game is a little confusing at first. Gameplay / Mission wise if you didnt play from launch. (Because the game is alinned with the TV show defience and is added on with each season. ) it almost feels as if you just dont connect as well with the game.\nStory wise the game is very weak i probably would understand it more if i watched the show but i just dont want to put the time into the series quiet yet. And another part i felt about the gae that hits the story hard is that almost all the characters voice acting sounds like the producers walked outside found some random hobo and said they would pay for his meal if he did one or two voices.\nAnother thing i must add is character customization is there just minimal.  just dont expect a level of cuztomization like skyrim or SWTOR.\nBTW the game is much more fun if you play with a friend.\nSo really all in all despite a couple bugs (None game breaking) its a solid MMO/RPG to the genre. And since its free now theres no reason not to check it out. Defiance is a ton of fun and can give you a great time.

I have two main reasons for that:\n1) Mechanics are always pretty much the same, point, click, skill hotkey, etc etc\n2) Fantasy-Japanese-Medieval-Magic theme over and over again, with silly storyes and sexist characters.\n\nDefiance has neither of them. Althought it shares common aspects of any other MMO, this game has a good controller suport, to start with.\nI know it's not the first MMO shooter, but it delivers pretty well in that aspect, it vaguely reminds me of a MAss Effect X Borderlands feeling.\n\nNow, the game has several problems, like being almost constantly laggish, enemyes have questionable AI and interfaces are quite confusing at the start.\nBut somehow this game got me coming back at it.\n\nAnother good thing is that I find myself useful in every event. In other games, as you join up early and powerless, your useless, but here I find myself on the top 5 players every time.\nAnd that´s another great thing, now that it's free. Almost any event or just anywere you're going you'll end up having a lot of other players helping you out (by helping themselves out), and no argument and crying around about sharing the loot.\n\nStory here is not great, but is quite engaging. Quests are a little repetitive (go somewhere, shoot enemyes, activate something), but it has kept me hooked.\n\nI've never spent real money buying items for the games, but I might give it a try on this one, just to support it.","August 1, 2014","true","56.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So I'll never max my character, but I find reaching for 5000, and likely 5400 will be satisfactory.\n\nWhatever you do find a place called Headlands transit.  Vehicles can be bought there for the game currency, make sure you get at least a duni.  And, when you can affor it, get a Dodge Caravan.  The Duni maneuvers well, you'll be surprised, but the Caravan hits hard, and a most morbid thrill for me is running around killing mutants with my vehicle haha\n\nIf you're into zombies, seek out the afflicted, and make sure you get a BMG weapon.  You'll be laughing over and over every time you use it against afflicted, not the most powerful weapon, but that's relative anyway.\n\nDefiance uses a scaling system, those who play Rift will be familiar with this. and the scaling system can make life a pain, but that usually means better rewards.\n\nAnd, as far as metacritic is concerned, I look at it this way.  64 is 14 over 50, and with most game reviewers being PVP elitists, they will never give Defiance a great review, always slightly above average because their PVP bias weighs so heavy in their scoring compared to the game itself.\n\nYou can't find a better game to play that's free, that has a lot to do, has great clans and great atmosphere, is sci-fi, has aliens and zombies, had a pretty good sized map, has just a lot going for it as a real game, with a storyline that generally follows (a season behind) a syfy television show, with good cut scenes and voice acting.\n\nOh and, no requirement of ground travel to towns, once you find it you double-click and are there.\n\nAdditionally, and I don't care who thinks this is "unrealistic" no damage from falling, or landing off a cliff, or jumping too high.  The game wants to be played, not cursed, and isn't trying to stop you from enjoying what you want to enjoy.  Not many games anymore do that, most game Devs seem to think their job is destroying anything the players enjoy, while complaining sales are down... Apparently most do not understand the simple principle of cause and effect haha.  Trion has its issues, has had trouble with ups and downs, but they do know how to make a fun game, a challenging game, that once and a while is too much for me, but not so much I curse the game, and the company for being arrogant and not caring about their market and community, because, as I said, overall Trion does deliver what it promises to the player in Defiance.\n\nDownload and enjoy Defiance, I had my issues with it at one time but they fixed that, and some of them were just me being wrongfully picky hahaha\n\nI may soon download the DLC for Defiance, and that says a lot coming from someone who doesn't like to pay to play anything since NCSoft's player abuse by closing Tabula Rasa 2 days before its 2nd Black Friday.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOld Review begins here:\n\nDefiance has its own client and a really great salvage system so you don't lose money you spent previously on upgrades/mods.\n\nEasy to play.  Challenging missions and encounters.  Ability to play with all levels together.  Weapons have a great range.  You get a vehicle at the beginning and can upgrade to newer vehicles through faction.  Just all and all well thought out, well planned and appears to be catering to a very broad market, with a game for everyone.\n\nA great feature that is missing in many games is being able to set preferences so you don't have to be a PVP player, there's also a shadow conflict area (PVP) that just shows up over cities and areas of the map.  Thus you can participate if you want but are never forced to be a PVP player.  I bring this up as a strictly PVE player who is amazed how large the map is, how they have encounters yet gave us a way around them.  The game seems so designed around the player and the player experience compared to many games I've played, such as Firefall, Face of Mankind, and others which are less well known and/or older.\n\nI was really into Tabula Rasa, which was closed due to a lack of advertising that appears to have been coordinated for corporate politics at NCSoft, Defiance is as close as I can come to Tabula Rasa.  There have been others that came close until they made radical changes to their game and chose paths away from as broad a market as they could have (and therefore able to afford the game being open).  Some games, however, are choosing narrow markets which is of course their choice.  Defiance appears to be, since it's based from a SyFy television show, appealing to as broad a market as possible and is designed to do that without these markets segments of gamers with their own designs as to how they'll play the game trespassing on each other.  So I'll say something that my friends will find rare:  Definance is a great game design which, when you play Defiance shows in the graphics, shows in the options that open up as you advance, just a clear demonstration that Trion took the time to really think out the game, while coordinating missions to episodes too.  Definance has a lot of side missions, a lot of content outside of what you can just do to level, and the side missions have their own rewards that you'll want as much as leveling.  I am finding Definance a great game with enough depth to play for a very long time.  I just hope they don't make some radical change in the future away from what will get them the greatest chance to be a great decades played game success.\n\nDefiance has their own client too, Glyph, and apparently are no longer going to be played through steam.  You'll note I have no time played showed and this is why -- Been playing for 8 days straight now, it's a lot of fun, a lot to explore still, only partially in San Francisco.\n\n\nDownload Defiance, it's free to play, though I believe PVPr's will want to pay some since it appears a bit P2win for that level of game play, but for PVEr's it's just a lot of fun with a great story, in a world where you have no home, no bank, and write your story as you play.\n\n\nMcG ("Cutti" in Defiance)\n\n\nP.S.  Just go to this link, http://www.trionworlds.com/defiance/en/2014/07/28/introducing-silicon-valleys-encrypted-items/ and do a word search for "punative," then read the paragraph around it and you see developers refering to themselves as gamers and explaining not to do something because it would be received as punative to the player community.  This is what we gamers are looking for, we who so many companies just want to take our money and ignore what we want or the fact they presented a game and its gameplay asking for players and we accepted their offer, only to have them treat it all as erasable at the developer's whim without any thought to the punitive nature of what they were doing to the player experience enjoyed, even afer losing half their player base.  Integrity is a rare quality, and though Trion has issues with games they make and support response times, their developers, the heart of their game's designs, aren't egocentric and ignoring the very players they hope will buy things in their in game shops.  This is a rare quality in a gaming company and one that you begin the appreciation of by downloading the game.","July 30, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In terms of game mechanics, it is purely identical to Borderlands.\n\nHowever, with all the potential for interaction, adventure and intrigue derived from the TV series, it COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH MORE. Instead of a unique taste of the Arch, we receive another copy of Fallout: New Vegas, but drastically simplified. Lack of distinct classes, professions, specialties and crafting, as well as lack of dynamic universe, economics, personal wealth (only cash and cosmetic gear), zones of control and conflicting factions is imho a drawback, not an advantage. The few options for character's development are all explored very quick, and the game becomes repeatable.\n\nThis game has a vast potential of evolving into a perfect and detailed ♥♥♥♥♥♥me, but as of today, it will only satisfy shooter genre fans. I recommend the game for its great graphics, cool multiplayer map events and its potential for future development.

So I'll never max my character, but I find reaching for 5000, and likely 5400 will be satisfactory.\n\nWhatever you do find a place called Headlands transit.  Vehicles can be bought there for the game currency, make sure you get at least a duni.  And, when you can affor it, get a Dodge Caravan.  The Duni maneuvers well, you'll be surprised, but the Caravan hits hard, and a most morbid thrill for me is running around killing mutants with my vehicle haha\n\nIf you're into zombies, seek out the afflicted, and make sure you get a BMG weapon.  You'll be laughing over and over every time you use it against afflicted, not the most powerful weapon, but that's relative anyway.\n\nDefiance uses a scaling system, those who play Rift will be familiar with this. and the scaling system can make life a pain, but that usually means better rewards.\n\nAnd, as far as metacritic is concerned, I look at it this way.  64 is 14 over 50, and with most game reviewers being PVP elitists, they will never give Defiance a great review, always slightly above average because their PVP bias weighs so heavy in their scoring compared to the game itself.\n\nYou can't find a better game to play that's free, that has a lot to do, has great clans and great atmosphere, is sci-fi, has aliens and zombies, had a pretty good sized map, has just a lot going for it as a real game, with a storyline that generally follows (a season behind) a syfy television show, with good cut scenes and voice acting.\n\nOh and, no requirement of ground travel to towns, once you find it you double-click and are there.\n\nAdditionally, and I don't care who thinks this is "unrealistic" no damage from falling, or landing off a cliff, or jumping too high.  The game wants to be played, not cursed, and isn't trying to stop you from enjoying what you want to enjoy.  Not many games anymore do that, most game Devs seem to think their job is destroying anything the players enjoy, while complaining sales are down... Apparently most do not understand the simple principle of cause and effect haha.  Trion has its issues, has had trouble with ups and downs, but they do know how to make a fun game, a challenging game, that once and a while is too much for me, but not so much I curse the game, and the company for being arrogant and not caring about their market and community, because, as I said, overall Trion does deliver what it promises to the player in Defiance.\n\nDownload and enjoy Defiance, I had my issues with it at one time but they fixed that, and some of them were just me being wrongfully picky hahaha\n\nI may soon download the DLC for Defiance, and that says a lot coming from someone who doesn't like to pay to play anything since NCSoft's player abuse by closing Tabula Rasa 2 days before its 2nd Black Friday.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOld Review begins here:\n\nDefiance has its own client and a really great salvage system so you don't lose money you spent previously on upgrades/mods.\n\nEasy to play.

I put off playing it for a long time because I had played it on the 360 in its beta stages, and although i liked it, when it released i never bought it.\n\nI heard it went free to play but still never played it when finally bordom got the better of me and i sifted through the free to play library over and over, constantly seeing defiance. I downloaded, creeated my account and hopped in. The first thing i noticed was that for an old (ish) game the graphics were still very pleasing. Sure theres some rough edges but thats to be expected. I played about 10 hours into the story, and somehow this game had not only hooked me, but got me immersed into the worlds story, and history. It made me do something i've never doen before, and that's watch a programme ;p\n\nI sat down and watched the first season of Defiance (the show) and oh my I was impressed. Whenever I watched the show I wanted to go play the game and vice versa. Both entities complimented each other, and whenever I had watched an episode when I went in game I felt more involved, like I had a reason why I was trying to save the planet.\n\nNever has an mmo hooked me into its world, I mean even ESO didn't achieve that for me, so I appluad Trion.\n\nNow onto the gameplay. Its a great third person shooter in short. You have acces to a wide variety of weaponry, smgs, assault rifles, shotguns, snipers, rocket launchers... You name it. Unlocking some dlcs brings even more flavour to the show, which I have done and which I highly recomend, while its on sale after all. If you have watched any of the show you wll be happy to know that the charge blade makes an appearance, and to obtain it you must comoplete a series of very fun arenas in my honest opinion. It opens a whole new play style as you can now effectivley play as a melee player.\n\nOther fun weapons such as infectors (shoots bugs) projectile based weaponry and charge up weapons all make this packaged all the more exciting.\n\nYou also have to use cover,  A LOT. This is what makes this mmo a lot more fun for me, you need to be aware of your surroundings and you can't just stand still and spam your gun/abilities. There's a dodge mechanic, that can put you out of harms way from bullets and selected enemy charge up attacks, and it is also used to put out any negative effect on your character quicker, such as being set on fire or being slowed down by something.\n\nOnto the world. from what I have explored, big, 3 continant type areas and a smaller area (i think is dlc i have not been there yet) Some areas are bleak looking and some are full of life, yes some areas look a bit empty but for the most part the world is fun to explore. Data recorders are spread throughout the map in hidden and out of reach areas so if you are into that type of thing you will feel right at home.\n\nWhat brings the world to life though are the dynamic events, you will find many random encounters where you must complete a series of objectives to gain a reward. Save some prisoners, disable this, collect that etc. These are fun and a good time waster, but its the arkfalls that seal the deal. All players can see the icons on the map so going to one is normally chaotic. These really are one of the (sadly) few end game events however I was playing them at the start of my game, any one can play them and make a difference. These can be very fun and rewarding and make for a great time.\n\nAccesing the world is very easy. You can fast travel to any hub area you have already traveled to and (which suprised me) you gain access to a vehicle VERY early on, which isn't really seen in many mmos. Time trails are present for the avid driver and driving mechanics are fun, they arnt just slapepd into the game like they dont belong, all the vehicles have different handling and whats great is you can buy the fastest ones with ingame currency.\n\nIS IT F2P OR P2W?\nf2p for sure, you can buy inventory slots etc and suppl cases with real money but you can buy the same cases with in game currency so no one is at a disadvantage.\n\nTrion got a lot of flak for this game and I don't know why. It's solid, great fun and if you find a clan, very rewarding.\n\nIS THE GAME DEAD??\nFrom what I have seen? No, Just last night I went to a war master (boss major arkfall) and I turned up first with like 3 other people... 2 minutes later a good 70 people flocked down and omg it was MENTAL! Enemies seem to scale with the number of players so it was very difficult but everyone banded together and afterwards we all traded items that we got as drops and rewards.

Its a great combination RPG and third-person shooter, with a very well balanced mix of open world cooperative and pvp gameplay.\n\nThere are plenty of missions broken up into different categories. Main story missions, side missions, some repeatable, some not. As well as both coop and pvp missions. So no matter if your a lone player, or playing with friends, there is enough in Defiance to keep everyone happy. Oh, and we can't forget Arkfalls, huge cooperative battles between a boss and the players in the open world.\n\nThe gameplay and game mechanics are best compared to Borderlands. Weapon and item nano (elemental) effects, weapon customization, lock boxes similar to the loot crates in Borderlands, and fully customizable skill (Ego) tree.  Lots of different vehicles to drive, weapons to own, different outfits and titles to wear, there is plenty of customization available for most anyone.\n\nThe game is not too easy, but not too hard, it seems very well balanced. The graphic and sound quality is quite good and it seems to run very well on a wide range of machines.\n\nIf you're looking for a rather unique MMO RPG shooter experience, then Defiance is a must, even if you're not a fan of the SyFy series, there is still a LOT of fun to be had in this game.","September 17, 2013","true","186.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So I'll never max my character, but I find reaching for 5000, and likely 5400 will be satisfactory.\n\nWhatever you do find a place called Headlands transit.  Vehicles can be bought there for the game currency, make sure you get at least a duni.  And, when you can affor it, get a Dodge Caravan.  The Duni maneuvers well, you'll be surprised, but the Caravan hits hard, and a most morbid thrill for me is running around killing mutants with my vehicle haha\n\nIf you're into zombies, seek out the afflicted, and make sure you get a BMG weapon.  You'll be laughing over and over every time you use it against afflicted, not the most powerful weapon, but that's relative anyway.\n\nDefiance uses a scaling system, those who play Rift will be familiar with this. and the scaling system can make life a pain, but that usually means better rewards.\n\nAnd, as far as metacritic is concerned, I look at it this way.  64 is 14 over 50, and with most game reviewers being PVP elitists, they will never give Defiance a great review, always slightly above average because their PVP bias weighs so heavy in their scoring compared to the game itself.\n\nYou can't find a better game to play that's free, that has a lot to do, has great clans and great atmosphere, is sci-fi, has aliens and zombies, had a pretty good sized map, has just a lot going for it as a real game, with a storyline that generally follows (a season behind) a syfy television show, with good cut scenes and voice acting.\n\nOh and, no requirement of ground travel to towns, once you find it you double-click and are there.\n\nAdditionally, and I don't care who thinks this is "unrealistic" no damage from falling, or landing off a cliff, or jumping too high.  The game wants to be played, not cursed, and isn't trying to stop you from enjoying what you want to enjoy.  Not many games anymore do that, most game Devs seem to think their job is destroying anything the players enjoy, while complaining sales are down... Apparently most do not understand the simple principle of cause and effect haha.  Trion has its issues, has had trouble with ups and downs, but they do know how to make a fun game, a challenging game, that once and a while is too much for me, but not so much I curse the game, and the company for being arrogant and not caring about their market and community, because, as I said, overall Trion does deliver what it promises to the player in Defiance.\n\nDownload and enjoy Defiance, I had my issues with it at one time but they fixed that, and some of them were just me being wrongfully picky hahaha\n\nI may soon download the DLC for Defiance, and that says a lot coming from someone who doesn't like to pay to play anything since NCSoft's player abuse by closing Tabula Rasa 2 days before its 2nd Black Friday.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOld Review begins here:\n\nDefiance has its own client and a really great salvage system so you don't lose money you spent previously on upgrades/mods.\n\nEasy to play.  Challenging missions and encounters.  Ability to play with all levels together.  Weapons have a great range.  You get a vehicle at the beginning and can upgrade to newer vehicles through faction.  Just all and all well thought out, well planned and appears to be catering to a very broad market, with a game for everyone.\n\nA great feature that is missing in many games is being able to set preferences so you don't have to be a PVP player, there's also a shadow conflict area (PVP) that just shows up over cities and areas of the map.  Thus you can participate if you want but are never forced to be a PVP player.  I bring this up as a strictly PVE player who is amazed how large the map is, how they have encounters yet gave us a way around them.  The game seems so designed around the player and the player experience compared to many games I've played, such as Firefall, Face of Mankind, and others which are less well known and/or older.\n\nI was really into Tabula Rasa, which was closed due to a lack of advertising that appears to have been coordinated for corporate politics at NCSoft, Defiance is as close as I can come to Tabula Rasa.  There have been others that came close until they made radical changes to their game and chose paths away from as broad a market as they could have (and therefore able to afford the game being open).  Some games, however, are choosing narrow markets which is of course their choice.  Defiance appears to be, since it's based from a SyFy television show, appealing to as broad a market as possible and is designed to do that without these markets segments of gamers with their own designs as to how they'll play the game trespassing on each other.  So I'll say something that my friends will find rare:  Definance is a great game design which, when you play Defiance shows in the graphics, shows in the options that open up as you advance, just a clear demonstration that Trion took the time to really think out the game, while coordinating missions to episodes too.  Definance has a lot of side missions, a lot of content outside of what you can just do to level, and the side missions have their own rewards that you'll want as much as leveling.  I am finding Definance a great game with enough depth to play for a very long time.  I just hope they don't make some radical change in the future away from what will get them the greatest chance to be a great decades played game success.\n\nDefiance has their own client too, Glyph, and apparently are no longer going to be played through steam.  You'll note I have no time played showed and this is why -- Been playing for 8 days straight now, it's a lot of fun, a lot to explore still, only partially in San Francisco.\n\n\nDownload Defiance, it's free to play, though I believe PVPr's will want to pay some since it appears a bit P2win for that level of game play, but for PVEr's it's just a lot of fun with a great story, in a world where you have no home, no bank, and write your story as you play.\n\n\nMcG ("Cutti" in Defiance)\n\n\nP.S.  Just go to this link, http://www.trionworlds.com/defiance/en/2014/07/28/introducing-silicon-valleys-encrypted-items/ and do a word search for "punative," then read the paragraph around it and you see developers refering to themselves as gamers and explaining not to do something because it would be received as punative to the player community.  This is what we gamers are looking for, we who so many companies just want to take our money and ignore what we want or the fact they presented a game and its gameplay asking for players and we accepted their offer, only to have them treat it all as erasable at the developer's whim without any thought to the punitive nature of what they were doing to the player experience enjoyed, even afer losing half their player base.  Integrity is a rare quality, and though Trion has issues with games they make and support response times, their developers, the heart of their game's designs, aren't egocentric and ignoring the very players they hope will buy things in their in game shops.  This is a rare quality in a gaming company and one that you begin the appreciation of by downloading the game.","July 30, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I put off playing it for a long time because I had played it on the 360 in its beta stages, and although i liked it, when it released i never bought it.\n\nI heard it went free to play but still never played it when finally bordom got the better of me and i sifted through the free to play library over and over, constantly seeing defiance. I downloaded, creeated my account and hopped in. The first thing i noticed was that for an old (ish) game the graphics were still very pleasing. Sure theres some rough edges but thats to be expected. I played about 10 hours into the story, and somehow this game had not only hooked me, but got me immersed into the worlds story, and history. It made me do something i've never doen before, and that's watch a programme ;p\n\nI sat down and watched the first season of Defiance (the show) and oh my I was impressed. Whenever I watched the show I wanted to go play the game and vice versa. Both entities complimented each other, and whenever I had watched an episode when I went in game I felt more involved, like I had a reason why I was trying to save the planet.\n\nNever has an mmo hooked me into its world, I mean even ESO didn't achieve that for me, so I appluad Trion.\n\nNow onto the gameplay. Its a great third person shooter in short. You have acces to a wide variety of weaponry, smgs, assault rifles, shotguns, snipers, rocket launchers... You name it. Unlocking some dlcs brings even more flavour to the show, which I have done and which I highly recomend, while its on sale after all. If you have watched any of the show you wll be happy to know that the charge blade makes an appearance, and to obtain it you must comoplete a series of very fun arenas in my honest opinion. It opens a whole new play style as you can now effectivley play as a melee player.\n\nOther fun weapons such as infectors (shoots bugs) projectile based weaponry and charge up weapons all make this packaged all the more exciting.\n\nYou also have to use cover,  A LOT. This is what makes this mmo a lot more fun for me, you need to be aware of your surroundings and you can't just stand still and spam your gun/abilities. There's a dodge mechanic, that can put you out of harms way from bullets and selected enemy charge up attacks, and it is also used to put out any negative effect on your character quicker, such as being set on fire or being slowed down by something.\n\nOnto the world. from what I have explored, big, 3 continant type areas and a smaller area (i think is dlc i have not been there yet) Some areas are bleak looking and some are full of life, yes some areas look a bit empty but for the most part the world is fun to explore. Data recorders are spread throughout the map in hidden and out of reach areas so if you are into that type of thing you will feel right at home.\n\nWhat brings the world to life though are the dynamic events, you will find many random encounters where you must complete a series of objectives to gain a reward. Save some prisoners, disable this, collect that etc. These are fun and a good time waster, but its the arkfalls that seal the deal. All players can see the icons on the map so going to one is normally chaotic. These really are one of the (sadly) few end game events however I was playing them at the start of my game, any one can play them and make a difference. These can be very fun and rewarding and make for a great time.\n\nAccesing the world is very easy. You can fast travel to any hub area you have already traveled to and (which suprised me) you gain access to a vehicle VERY early on, which isn't really seen in many mmos. Time trails are present for the avid driver and driving mechanics are fun, they arnt just slapepd into the game like they dont belong, all the vehicles have different handling and whats great is you can buy the fastest ones with ingame currency.\n\nIS IT F2P OR P2W?\nf2p for sure, you can buy inventory slots etc and suppl cases with real money but you can buy the same cases with in game currency so no one is at a disadvantage.\n\nTrion got a lot of flak for this game and I don't know why. It's solid, great fun and if you find a clan, very rewarding.\n\nIS THE GAME DEAD??\nFrom what I have seen? No, Just last night I went to a war master (boss major arkfall) and I turned up first with like 3 other people... 2 minutes later a good 70 people flocked down and omg it was MENTAL! Enemies seem to scale with the number of players so it was very difficult but everyone banded together and afterwards we all traded items that we got as drops and rewards. A truly great moment in my gaming history\n\n9/10 - Not the best UI, diverse enemies but quite a few repeatable missions. Other than that, BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!!\nUmmmm I mean, DOWNLOAD it... For free... What have you got left to lose ArkHunter?","January 3","true","50.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","1","2","3","0"

Its a great combination RPG and third-person shooter, with a very well balanced mix of open world cooperative and pvp gameplay.\n\nThere are plenty of missions broken up into different categories. Main story missions, side missions, some repeatable, some not. As well as both coop and pvp missions. So no matter if your a lone player, or playing with friends, there is enough in Defiance to keep everyone happy. Oh, and we can't forget Arkfalls, huge cooperative battles between a boss and the players in the open world.\n\nThe gameplay and game mechanics are best compared to Borderlands. Weapon and item nano (elemental) effects, weapon customization, lock boxes similar to the loot crates in Borderlands, and fully customizable skill (Ego) tree.  Lots of different vehicles to drive, weapons to own, different outfits and titles to wear, there is plenty of customization available for most anyone.\n\nThe game is not too easy, but not too hard, it seems very well balanced. The graphic and sound quality is quite good and it seems to run very well on a wide range of machines.\n\nIf you're looking for a rather unique MMO RPG shooter experience, then Defiance is a must, even if you're not a fan of the SyFy series, there is still a LOT of fun to be had in this game.","September 17, 2013","true","186.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It felt similar to how Borderlands gameplay progressed. Once you've seen all the (very similar) fights, you just do the same thing over and over in hopes that the enemies drop better weapons. No crafting, no skill required after you master the mechanics about 20 hours into playing.\n\nPVP is a nightmare for low levels.

Absolutely everything that you ever hated about every other cheap console title is present here. My list of complaints could go on for days on end, but lets try to narrow it down to what made me review it negatively shall we?\n\nPay To Win... Need I say more. Sure you can unlock things for free, but everything from (the few armors that look good) to weapons people obviously spent money maxing out the rarity is only going to be obtainable through your wallet book. The most despicable thing about that concept is that it effects PvE AND PvP heavily. People who cranked out the dough early on will have a significant edge over people who haven't spent a dime. You'll next to NEVER kill someone who's either spent money making their weapon gold or farming for like 90 days+   and 90 days by the way is for those who are extremely lucky with the lockboxes.\n\nNext order of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ttery...  Certain enemy types.  See your armor will break the more that you take damage. Fine right?  WRONG!!! Every faction nearly has that ONE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t enemy that either has a really cheap homing attack like the bug archers who snipe your ♥♥♥.  The pink missile launching  Volge, or the weird robots that dig their hands into the ground and instantly hit you from wherever you stand.  Once you have a certain amount of damage done unto you, you'll be going down time and time and time and INFURIATING time again. I've never wanted to snap my controller in half more with any other game than this one right here.  There's a difference between challenging and flat out stupid.  Even MLG pro players who obviously cranked out mommy's tax returns still somehow manage to occasionally go down at the hands of end game leveled mobs.\n\nWhile the game is a scifi free roam MMO shooter, (& that's a huge turn on.)  It utterly FAILS at such basic things. Collision detecting is a big thing. You could be driving along when all of a sudden the SMALLEST lips in the world completely cut off your momentum. Or your vehicle will explode having hit cover near an arkfall! Ever wanted to get COMPLETELY stopped dead in your tracks by running straight into a Stop Sign? Well this is the game for you then! Cause  of all things you would expect to be destructible (signs)  they're not, and if you hit them you come to a complete stop. The driving is just hideous and controls like a 500 lbs. bowling ball!\n\nThe voice acting and animations I've seen for this are so cheesy. At one point you'll meet a black man who's CLEARLY voiced by a white man, & its just sooo awkward! Awkward infact, is a very accurate word used to describe the campaign which fails to make you give a ♥♥♥♥ about. Even sad moments are just so cheesy you just end up laughing in disgust. These devs are so lazy that they actually take armor THAT YOU PAY FOR from the cash shop and re-color it and offer it to you again either for more money or the less attractive ones can be earned through some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t pursuits. And when I say pursuits I really mean like a LIST, a full blown LIST of things you have to do.  Kill 50,000 enemies? Yeah go ♥♥♥♥ yourself!  The laziness will begin to show even more so when you start side questing and you realize just how many times they re-use and recycle areas.  You'll go back and fourth from one place getting this, talking to this guy, pressing this switch and the combat isn't even enough to keep you interested for the first 10 quests let alone the HUNDREDS. I wouldn't mind fetch questing if there were simply more to do.\n\nArguably the only 2 things the devs did right here is these things called Incursions & Arkfalls. These things are big events you can see going on in your map. It attracts HUNDREDS of players to that area & the sheer chaos is what has kept me addicted. Nowhere ever before have I seen SO many players in one area fighting so many enemies. It's beautiful! It's some of the best war scenes you never seen in games OR movies! The epic scale warfare is so good in fact that the downfall of it all is the last thing about it that's actually positive.   Your guns are all customizable. You can put mods on, upgrade rarity, choose from a massive list of perks. The heavy detail you can go into your powers and how your gun operates is really well done. So well done that its going to show in PvP or PvE & that's the one thing I cannot stand about this game. Absolutely NOTHING amounts to skill.  It's all about your build. If you've gotta good build (which in most cases is paid for) you'll demolish. If not..... Have fun grinding away DAYS of your life trying to get good.\n\nWhat upsets me the most about this game is that the focus is nowhere near where it needs to be. Why does the game have to follow or even be parallel to the events of the show? Why can't it just be a standalone game within the Defiance universe every so often showing a main character.  Instead of investing ANY time at all into a campaign they could have focused their WHOLE game around this awesome principle of uniting hundreds of players and expanded upon it. So fellow Defiance players if you're reading this... Imagine if they had included tanks, jets, or even HALF of the vehicles you SEE parked in the game.  At the very least they could've let your partner (who's riding passenger) lean our the passenger side window and shoot.  Car chases could've been a thing for fetch questing like freaking GTA!  They could've even taken it a step further and had squad leaders determine which contracts (aka quests) to complete and then raid fully detailed buildings instead of what we're left with. (Which is buildings you see.... but can never go into.)   I'm just so tired at the half ♥♥♥ attempt to be a free roam scifi roleplaying shooter.  I salute the devs to be one of the first games to do this next to Firefall & Borderlands, but some of the most basic things you would expect from ANY game are just absent here.  If you attempt to contact the devs stating your gripes, they'll be sure to ignore you and then nerf an exploit that you found to be helpful in your progression. Surely this is why you see ABSOLUTELY NO uploaders on YouTube still covering this game anymore.\n\nMy verdict is simple. I won't recommend it (so that explains the thumbs down) but I will say that if you're bored and have nothing else better to do with your life. This can provide you some cheap fun.  I have not a single clue why developers keep making us fight bugs (which is so dumb) but you'll encounter those, zombies, robots, raiders, aliens, religious bigots, and dozens of other poorly voiced characters and factions. It has a sure amount of diversity and the free roam with the inclusion of vehicles is very nice. Just note that this method of rinse and repeat WILL get old. And it will get old VERY quickly...

Now I was a bit skeptical of a tv/movie tie in game because normaly 9 outta 10 times they fail. However Defiance rocks the statistic to the positive side. Now its does have it little quirks and things that could be done better and a bit repeditive at some points. But the Good well outwieghs the bad. the Graphics are fantasic, the tv show tie in is  not the whole point of the game ( they characters are there but your living in their world ), the customization of character and weapons is good.

NOTE: (Also to consider Defiance WAS a paid MMO until the developers changed it to a free-to-play games without refunding people who brought the original digital and physical copies of the game. But for this review I will ONLY be talking about the game. Not the crap customer service of Trion. )\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPROS\n- Solid gunplay\nOne thing does do right is how guns feel to shoot and handle in the game. Sniper feel like snipers, SMG's feel like SMG's. Nuff said.\n\n-Good world art design which matches the sci-fi theme\n\nThe open world and art design might not be your cup of tea, but it's fair to say that it suits the futuristic apocalyptic setting of Earth. (For the most part of the game)\n\n- Arkfalls, 4 player co-op\n\nIn my opinion these are currently the two best game modes/events in Defiance. Arkfalls events are dotted across the map and sees you gun down waves of braindead AI enemys for easy loot and XP. These consist of minor arkfalls which happen 24/7 or major arkfalls which makes you fight a boss which will kick your ♥♥♥ if you're not careful. But seriously, get pwned by a boss with friends can be a blast. Also I recommended if you're new to the game, ♥♥♥♥  the story and drive off to some arkfalls. Your EGO level and in-game money balance will thank me later ;)\n\n4-player co-op is probably my favourite game mode which justifies the 16GB+ game download. You and 3 others are sent to some underground bunker or enemy base to massacre every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in sight but unlike arkfalls when you can do sweet FA and still get good rewards, 4-player co-op requires at least a bit of skill and teamwork to avoid all of your team getting "incapacitated".\n\n\nCONS\n\n-  Story- The less said about the weak nonexistent drab storyline the better, And let's not even get started on the cutscences and awful voice acting. If you're the kinda of person who likes treading on LEGO pieces barefoot, and drinking toliet cleaner then the Defiance storyline is for you! t For your own wellbeing and sanity, avoid unnecessary story missions at ALL costs, you have been warned.\n\n-S*it b"battle" music\nThe person who made the annoying INFINITELY looping battle music should be fired and sent to North Korea. It's sounds like it was ripped from a episode of Seinfeld and not made for a sci-fi futurstic 3rd person shooter.\n\nS*it DLC\nSave your money. Nuff said\n\nSmall player base\n\nTrion deserver a medal for how any people they have managed to ♥♥♥♥ off with their shady tactics and crap customer service. Because of his the player base has massively decreased over time so you'll probably either see vets and die hards players oe the handful of new players. There are still people online just not as many. Well done Trion, well ♥♥♥♥ing done.\n\nS*it UI\n\nUsing a mouse and keybaord? Well ♥♥♥♥ you then.\n\nToo many damn currencies\n\nWant that sweet weapon or cool car? Well ♥♥♥♥ you then. You need to get pointless rep OR you could burn £15 on "bits"\n\nOverall is hard to recommend Defiance because of many flaws listed above however it's still a solid game at the core and has/had SOO much potential that this could of been so much better.  I have had cloked over 300 hours on the PS3 port of the game so you can consider me as a diehard but even still the shady business descions of trion are hard to ignore.\n","May 14","true","82.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Nothing to see here. I still cant understand how is it possible to waste dozens of gigabytes and make a crappy character animation. Lots of settings are not customizable or are too generic to give you any control at all.\nThe world is crap, the story is ridiculous and except for your sidekick, there are no interesting characters. There are only 9 types of enemies and the challenge this game gives is about how many bullets you can shoot and how many you can take.\nThis game screams "I am a console game, dont bother with me."\n\nThe world is huge, but that adds nothing to the game but download size. Its an empty experience. Cars are there to take you to places which is just another boredom trip, but you also dont need them because you can just teleport to the location (which considering this game's quality can even be considered a good point). What this game does right, many other games often do better.\n\nControls suck,\nGraphics are so so with really crappy animation being its trademark,\nSound is repetitive and annoying,\nSocial is whatever. I even brought a friend in and I regret for both of us.\nCharacter progression locked if not by gameplay, by DLC which must be bought. Forget PVP which is DLC bound.\nGuns suck. Snipers will feel totally useless, smg'ers will have some fun but will need to keep an annoying walk home to refill bullets. Go rifles or shotguns and you may even get a decent score against those people who play this 24/7. Whatever you decide, prepare for lots of WTF when you get a pickup in the middle of a fight and your best weapon gets traded by a piethrower.

If you already own it thinking for 5 bucks you couldnt do worse(yet you can), dont waste your money on any of the DLC's or season's pass. Trion has more than adequately proven that they are incapable of redeeming this title or their reputation.","November 25, 2013","false","81.5"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","1"

I then start looking around, for a good 20-30 seconds, and then everything appears, my shield is down, and my HP is half gone. So I take my gun, shoot the enemies, and realise none are shooting back. Another 20-30 seconds goes by, those enemies are dead, and so am I, since in that time new enemies arrived. Unfortunately, those severe lags makes the game unplayable.

A great core system, and unique gameplay.\n\nDefiance, a new, fresh sapling, planted in the grove of TV shows, small among the larger titles, microscopic. However, it began to grow quickly, soon bringing ample fruit to Syfy. It began to grow and grow, to be almost as large as the others. The fruits were rich, and the tree ever-growing. Then, they decided to try something. Another group, another sapling, grown to intertwine with the first tree, creating a masterpiece, whilst also adding more fruit to their harvest. The second tree swiftly grew, as large as the first, maybe even larger. Both trees kept growing, and producing their fruit. Soon, though, the largest tree began to stop producing its fruit. Syfy decided it would be best to simply cut it down. They took it, leaving the younger tree alone. The tree still flourished, its fruit just as sweet as ever. That was soon to end. The tree was built upon the foundations of its elder. It was never supposed to stand on its own. It slowly began to stop growing, and slowly, its fruit, too, began to decline. The Developers tried desperately to keep it alive, to keep it well. Soon, they even went so far as to allow people the fruit, without charge. This slowly began to help, but it would never be enough to recover. The tree still dies, and there is only one thing that could save it. If they were to begin the cycle again, by planting the seed of Defiance, letting it grow in place of the elder, and supporting the other tree. Both would flourish, producing its sweet fruit again, for both the Developers, and Syfy. However, Syfy has a different plan. Planting trees that swiftly produced sub-par fruit, and die as quickly as they are grown. None surpassing the duo known as Defiance. Syfy seems to be ignoring the looming issue, that Defiance seems to have been one of the few decent trees they had planted, and they had ignored it, and simply cut it down as it began to decline.","May 6","true","121.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","0"

Yeah but something is just... not as it should be... something is missing. I cant quite put my finger on it just yet but something is holding it back from beeing "♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome" to just "pretty good".\n\nPros:\n- up to 64vs64 PvP (PvP also provides exp)\n- random events where tons of people group up and OWN ♥♥♥♥\n- Graphics are nothing special but still pretty good.\n- Customizable weapons. Borderlands style - a few parts to replace + weapon effects like fire, toxic etc\n- enemies have weak points (different for every creature) so good aim is required to deal more dps.\n- fully voiced\n- doing quests is optional, you can level up from events alone\n- levels dont really matter.\n\nCons:\n- The menu is terrible, obviously made for consoles\n- the EGO (or talents or whatever you like to call them) are pretty... bland and at times i feel like they're even pointless.\n- out of the 7 alien races (+ humans) in the TV show you get to pick between just 2 (3 if you get the DLC for it)\n- lack of wildlife, enemy variety and a rather small map. I mean c'mon its the post apocalyptic-ish teraformed Earth, they could've done alot more with that. It could be easily fixed in future expansions though.\n\nTheres alot more little things that i like/disslike about the game but all and all i'd give it a solid 7/10.\nIts still a fun free game so i'd reccomend you to give it a try, its not like you're losing anything.","October 7, 2014","true","60.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

But as a free game? You have to try this. Even if you don't like the story, poor acting, repetitive music or other many other things. The gameplay was done better than most of the triple A games that you see now. Even though it's boring, there is a sense of addiction that keeps bringing you back. Free to Play or Pay to Play More? You'll still have fun, and this game won't treat players who don't pay as second class players. If anything the paying players may be at more of a disadvantage.\n\nStill recieves updates. They recently added an entire but undeveloped (so far) large Island called Silicon Valley and it's not a DLC. Potential of things to come.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that this doesn't feel heavily like an MMO, the elements are there but it's not too distracting.

Has crossover missions that brings the TV show to the game.  Has player item trading system and 7 currencies.\n\nYou need to be good at gun shooting and movement to play this game. You have 2 weapon slots and a grenade slot per each loadout, have 2 loadouts. Has a free  single rider ATV for you to drive and there are driving challenges too. Has some 3 other vehicles types that you can spawn and drive for certain missions.\n\nHas plenty of AI bot targets to shoot, they jump and move at random while attacking, run out of building to surprize you and respawn rapidly.  The Headshot is your friend here, it does the most damage or one shot kill. Body shots tend to be low damage and take a lot of body hits to kill targets.  The whole world is a PvE Co-op map, It has 4 player Co-op maps. Has 4 PvP maps and a PvP event.\n\nIt would be great for fans of the Defiance show, and gamers that like shooter games.\n\n\nfor more info:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZz_KKGpgfk\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defiance_(video_game)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bZOlMjVMEg\n\nhttp://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/defiance\n\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/reviews/defiance-review/1900-6407168/\n\nhttp://venturebeat.com/2013/04/19/defiance-mmo-review/\n\nhttp://en.defiance-wiki.com/wiki/Defiance_(game)","August 7, 2015","true","10.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

But after a day or so you quickly realize how boring this is going to get.\n\nThe perks are simple.\n1. An open world, low skill based MMO. I've taken on enemies I probably shouldn't have and survived. And much like GW2, a far better game in my opinion, you don't NEED a party to help each other out.\n\nThe negatives are a little more.\n1. It doesn't require that much skill honestly, repetitive missions.\n2. Seriously sick of killing numerous bugs and bandits over and over and over and over and over and......getting it?\n3. If there are tutorials for 75% of what you should know, I can't find them. What I have had to do is exit the game and go watch a plethora of youtube videos just to get an idea of what the hell is going on.\n4. Anyone who tells you the graphics are awesome, should go back to consoles and stay there. This game looks like it came out in 2003.\n5. I fell 1000 meters and didn't die, yes that's a complaint. It's showing a huge flaw in the simplest aspects of a game.\n\nFInally, the biggest negative is the world. It's Earth, but not Earth. It's been 'partially' terraformed? That doesn't make a lick of sense. Lightsabers make more sense.\n\nIn the end, you might like to keep it around for a quick and easy way to blow off steam, but there are better games out there even for free.","November 26, 2014","false","21.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

While the community isnt growing, the devs still care about the players are release content constantly. HOWEVER: DO NOT go into this game thinking it's free, since it was a previous pay to play game, it definately has microtransactions. I bought the game before it was f2p for $15, and when they switched over to f2p, i got a few exclusives, but it was enough to keep in the fight for leaderboards and not fall behind people who constantly spent money. I would recommend putting in a little bit of money just to be able to do some extra stuff (something useful though, not a weapon crate or anything, but something like the keycode capacity upgrade, or something along the lines of that.) and if you don't want to, at least get the DLC, its actually something worth buying, not like a COD map pack or anything. The game itself plays similar to Destiny, constantly grinding, but still a ton of stuff to do. It also follows along with the TV show, so as new seasons come out, so do new missions.","February 19, 2014","true","72.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/recommended/224600/","Rhykevance","Sharisad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/","1008 products in account","Basically a third- and (when scoping guns first-)person Borderlands-ish MMOFPS with a thus far smaller cast and perhaps less crazy and silly attitudes but providing seemingly just as much things to shoot and collect and some maybe interesting lore and story though I won't judge now because I'm not too far into it yet.\n\nAreas are wide, cars can be spawned anytime, there are fixed hostile places to shoot mobs up at, main/side missions to pick up in the world and seemingly random events spawning all around. Indoor environments I haven't seen so far. There is very little direct interaction with the environment besides some gear vending machines, mission-specific buttons and terminals to use (like, no NPCs to talk to, no doors to open, no secret caves to discover) but the random events are aplenty and they can distract you and keep you busy all the time if you let them. They don't provide anything worth of attention story-/narration-wise, often it's "just" about you collecting some Alien flora, reviving/supporting NPCs in distress and generally shooting up hordes of enemies but thus far I'm not bored by it. It's fun to shoot stuff up and loot and level up and all.\n\nThe ambiance is generally good. Graphics are okay for a MMOG. I noticed a few nice music tracks, there are some reoccurring characters who are fully (and nicely) voiced having distinctive looks and their own but not necessarily too original personalities (so far: a kinda hard-boiled military guy, some sexy female Alien mercenary/hackwiz and some cocky senior researcher with what sounds like a German name - but thankfully he is fluent with his English so it's not 100% stereotype).\n\nImmersion is sometimes broken a bit when random events/groups/fighting spots appear because they do so quick without much introduction and hesitation and without much respect to the player's location, just as they disappear into thin air the same way afterwards. If you stand still in the middle of some lost, lonely road it can very much happen that a minute later a car barricade spawns around you with allied NPCs defending it and hostiles swarming it. One event has you defend a weapon vending machine and even if you are browsing it's corresponding buying menu the whole assets will vanish a minute or so later regardless if you've finished your purchases or not. That can feel awkward.\n\nCombat is real-time shooting. Third-person by default but some scoped guns let you go into first-person. Shoot, dodge, loot, shoot, dodge, loot. Loot contains ammo, cash and gear of various rarity stages. Revive or heal another player with a support gun maybe. Partying up is not required for these basics to work. XP is gained by finishing quests and killing stuff, every player apparently gets his own loot, certain random events encourage to fight together for their difficulty while others can be soloed with relative ease. Sometimes metaevents seem to spawn that have people drive across various places of the map in attempts to stop some hostile incursions or such. Especially multi-stage siege events require numerous players to fight together. There seem to be some other modes besides this open-world free-roam like PvP and special co-op which includes a matchmaking and seperate maps by the looks of it.\n\nAt a time you can have one active combat skill and two gear-related boosts (one affecting a small area around you and allies within, one only aiding you) with cooldowns. There is a skill grid to put level-up points into but that grid has you mostly acquire passive perks that boost your effectiveness with certain ways of combat rather than to give you active skills and thus the combat is initially dictated by what guns you use in which way. Some enemies have shields and armor, some guns and grenades have elemental attributes and there are regenerative shields you equip which play into this too. In the early phases fighting weaker enemies this doesn't play too much of a role but I expect this to get more important later on as I've already encountered some small bosses who are probably cracked easier when paying attention to these mechanics. There is something what felt like a class-selection to me in the beginning but it looks to me as if lines are rather blurry and you aren't forced as much to stick with one way of fighting.\n\nHostile AI is rather dumb. Enemies basically swarm you heads-up. They evade to the sides if you shoot, but I think I'm beginning to understand their patterns (at least those of the humanoid enemies). They have certain weak spots (humanoids mostly their heads, big bulky armored ones others which cripple them, critters elsewhere). They do have nice animations and effects and there is a quite some good lore-wise variety even in the earliest parts of the game: There are always some enemies attacking at range and some going for melee, but they have distinctive looks that make me want to know more about them and the background of their factions. One enemy pool for example consists of somewhat ghastly humanoids who, once killed, spawn futuristic revenant-like creatures that could have been inspired by Final Fantasy: Spirits Within.\n\nParts of the interface could feel a bit more intuitive. I'm particularly struggling a bit with the one that allows you to salvage and put mods into your guns because it requires too much back and forth I think. Others are pretty fine, and technically the game runs and looks well. Controls are easy and reduced to a minimum, the character creation is having some but not massive options. After an opening cutscene where you crash with a "Stratocarrier" onto what could be our earth or not (I haven't understood thus far; there is some terraforming talk but there the area map has locations named like earth-places such as "Silicon Valley") you are quickly dropped into the game and can get going on your own or follow the storyline.","May 30, 2015","true","37.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
