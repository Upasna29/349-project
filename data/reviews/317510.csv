You take the role of an astronaut who crashes against a planet and has to jump from planet to planet, avoiding fireballs and collecting screws and cogs for no reason other than to buy upgrades for himself in his spaceship.\n\nIf you lay all the horrifying failures in the story aside, however, you are treated with a simlistic yet for a while fun game that tests mostly your hand-eye coordination. Unfortunately you will notice that the game is as simple as a Flash game - which is not fair maybe to Flash games since there are some quite complex ones - or a mobile game - ditto - where you just tap to jump. That is all there is essentially.\n\nThe game is fun for a while, and the rewards and achievements surely add to this, but it lacks content. There only is the probably endless mode. As it is, it is a game to get a fast and easy 100 percent achievements, but it is not a game I would recommend paying a lot for. I had maybe one to two hours of fun with it, and another hour of just playing it for the final few achievements.\n\nThe graphics are simple but fitting, the sound also is neither good nor bad. The controls are very simple - mouse only and there you need only the left mouse button. You need to move the mouse only for menus.\n\nRecommended:\nIf you like a no-brainer game or want easy and fast 100% achievements. The felt worth for this is at maxmimum around 1.50 USD.\nI would say, if you have it you can try it, but if you don't have it there is no real reason to buy it. So neutral again, with a negative tendency however. Although I don't want to condemn it - there surely is a populace that enjoys such games -, it is nothing I can wholeheartedly recommend either. I apologize here to the developer, if he reads this, and want to encourage him to add a few more game modes, like maybe a challenge mode or so, to add some more value.","April 6, 2015","false","2.9"," 176 of 229 people (77%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","77","176","229","8","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/317510/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","OverviewBeyond Gravity is a game that follows the generic mobile game formula. Incredibly simplified game mechanics, cartoony graphics and Subway Surfer-esque challenge system as an incentive to continue playing.\n\nThe ProsPrice - Even if the game is not so content rich, the low price might even justify the purchase. Often seen on 50% off, the trading cards are also pricy, so even if you regret purchasing this, the damage will be minimal.\n\nAchievements - I must admit the main reason I got this game was that it was cheap and with easy to obtain achievements. I like getting games I can 100% without spending a lot of hours. This being said, the title will get you 40 achievements in about 4 hours (that's how long it took me)\nThe ConsGrinding - The game's objective is so basic and the upgrades require a lot of screws (aka "coins") that you will find yourself just grinding over and over again, aimlessly. I did not find the game nor challenging, nor fun. The only thing that kept me going were the challenges, which bring up the next point.\n\nRepetitive Challenges - As I've said, the gameplay is so minimal that the 40 challenges to beat (also the 40 achievements) are pretty much... the same. Many of them are just a reiteration of the last, but with a bigger number. Also, "Jumping" and "Landing on Planets" or "Play x games" and "Die x times" are the same thing. Doing 300, 500 respectively 1000 such actions is boring to say the least. Not to mention the boring "Double jump once" or "Unlock these".\nConclusionDo I liked the game? No. Would I reccomend it to someone? Again no. Or at least not for PC, mabye it's a good time killer for mobile, but when you're at your PC with so many games to choose from, I cannot see a reason this should be on the list. There simply isn't enough content to justify it.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

The description of the game mentions it is "procedurally generated", I guess that is what they meant.\n\nAs you progress through the game, the "planets" get smaller, they rotate faster and the distance between them increases. To deal with the growing difficulty, you can spend the picked up items to buy some upgrades. Now you can do multiple jumps in the air (space?), jump faster, pick up items at a greater distance, but nothing that changes the fundamental mechanics of the game. Additionally, the price for the upgrades is quite high, so you need to play again and again until you can afford to buy some upgrades, resulting in a gameplay that feels repetitive really quick (read: grindfest).\n\n\nAgain, what is Beyond Gravity?\n\nLong story short: it is a simple flash game.\n\nThe kind of game you can play on the web. I have no idea what the first flash games were, but they have been around for 15 years, easily. The more sophisticated ones, at least.\nSo, the thing is, there are dozens of flash games out there that are better than Beyond Gravity. And they are free.\n\nOn the plus side, Beyond Gravity has nice animations, and the visual style is pretty cute. And it has one distinct advantage over flash games on the web: achievements.\n\n\nMy rating:\n\nFor the genre (flash games):\n58 / 100\n\nFor the grand scheme of gaming things:\n5 / 100\n\n\nMy library categories:\n\nFlash, Trash","January 2, 2015","false","2.1"," 59 of 75 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","59","75","2","0"

Those who just want to complete the game should be aware that the game is the achievement hunting.\n\nSCORE:\n2 out of 10\n\nThis game is a waste of time.\n\nThere is literally no gameplay beyond clicking the mouse to jump.  The only obstacles are the occasional comets that move up and down between planets, but they are easily avoided.  The few upgrades (and skins) that the player can buy with the money that he earns are useless, with the exception of an upgrade that shows where to jump on each planet to maximize profit.  But since the player has no decisions to make besides where to jump, this upgrade reduces the game to nothing.\n\nAchievement hunters should be aware that some of these involve a great deal of grinding.  The most tedious to complete is "Land on 1000 Planets," which might not have been so bad if the game tracked it from the beginning.  Unfortunately, the in-game goal, and thus the achievement, only becomes available near the end of the game, when there is nothing to do.  At the time of writing this, there is nothing left for me but to land on another 500 planets, which seems like torture at this point.\n\nThe positive reviews here make no sense to me.  I understand that the game is only $2, but I was bored within minutes of starting because nothing changes.  I have played free games that do a much better job of keeping me interested.\n\nI give this a 2 out of 10.","April 27, 2015","false","3.0"," 69 of 94 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","69","94","2","0"

Your only interaction with the game is to tap click when you want your spaceman to jump. That's all.\n\nThis works out nicely for a game played on a mobile while waiting for a bus or something, but ends up leaving something to be desired when you're sat down in front of your PC with the intention of playing games.\n\nFurthermore, this leaves very few directions for the game to go when ramping up the difficulty - something a PC player sitting down to play is very soon going to notice, as they blaze through levels, whereas the mobile gamer is not only going to need to travel many times before this happens, but since there's usually some time between bus rides, the resulting repetetivity will not be noticed as readily.","June 7, 2015","false","1.5"," 58 of 79 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","58","79","4","2"

The story, or semblance of it, is that you're an astronaut sleeping while cruising through space on a ship when it's attacked by asteroids, making it crash onto a planet. From there onwards, your main goal is to get as much screws as you can as you jump from planet to planet using the Space-Bar or Left Mouse Button. During your travels you'll come up with challenges - some easy, some hard - that once completed, net you more screws. that can be used to upgrade your astronaut with all sorts of help, from a magnet for greater pickup distance, to a triple jump. Each challenge getting completed also nets you the corresponding achievement. This all reminds me of a Miniclip game called "Rocket Man" where you jumped from cloud to cloud, although all you have to do is take care of jumping rather than aim any angles - the planet's rotation does the angling for you. The music isn't much, just some looping drivel that isn't intrusive, but you -will- experience cutoff once it loops.\n\nOverall a stomachable game, but one you'll easily forget once you're done with all the challenges and getting all the upgrades.

Calling this a "one button procedurally generated platformer" is sort of stretching a few of those: when you boot it for the first time, it will become clear you're playing a touchscreen mobile title thrown onto Steam haphazardly*, and the entire purpose of the game is "collect space debris to upgrade yourself with powerups", as you leap between constantly-revolving planets, trying to dodge obstacles and leap at just the right time to continue your chain of screw-grabbing without breaking the combo (so you get more parts per cog).\n\nThe problem is, claiming this "doesn't get repetitive" is a lie. It's just "click, click, wait, click, click in midair because you have a double jump and need to adjust course, wait, click, wait, wait, click, click..." ad nauseum. As well, you're going to be playing A LOT of abortive runs to get the first powerup. I did about 8 rounds and was only at ~3500 of the minimum-10k currency you need for your first powerup. They get more expensive. If you want something to just zone out with and relax here and there, that's great, this is a great game at the price. I was hoping for something a little more challenging, not just a time-killer.\n\n* I don't care if a game comes from mobile, but I do care when you do it so, so poorly. Menus have no scrollbar and barely respond to a scrollwheel. You're going to be dragging the menu if you want to do anything, always a fun time when you use a mouse.","September 30, 2014","false","1.2"," 31 of 40 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","31","40","0","5"

It says in the "About this game, features" section that this game has this: "Procedurally generated levels ensure non-repetitive and never ending fun." Now, there isin't even levels, there is just one "level" you play on. I don't feel like the procedurally genereted part does ensure non-repetitive and never ending fun. The fun stops about 1-5 minutes after you've played it. The "level" is the same thing over and over and over again, just the 3 planets skins shifting in different speeds, rotationway (clockwise or anti-clockwise) and size. That is the only thing defferentiating.\n\nNow the music. There is only one soundtrack for this game, which I might add isin't very good, and yet loops again every so often.

One, not enough variety; two, the shop prices feel too high; three, there's little sense of risk.\n\nThe gameplay involves jumping from planet to planet while collecting screws and dodging fireballs that travel up and down. That's a nice foundation, but it's all there is. If you can line yourself up and time your jumps properly, you can go on for dozens of minutes in a single run and not see anything new besides planets, screws, and the occasional group of fireballs. It would have been nice to see different types of obstacles, planets, or powerups, especially once you survive past the first few minutes.\n\nMy first run lasted around twenty minutes, and I managed to collect around 10,000 screws. Not bad, right? Actually, that was barely enough to buy the cheapest item at the shop, and all it did was increase my jump speed slightly. Most items cost at least 40,000 screws, which equates to over an hour of playtime at my speed. When you consider how repetitive the gameplay can be, that feels way too long.\n\nThere are optional challenges you can complete, but I've gone through around 50% of them, and so far the payouts don't seem to exceed 1,000 - 2,000 screws. Maybe the later ones are better, but some of them are rather tedious (play 30 games), and you can only pursue three at a time. Keep in mind that most of the shop items themselves- jump faster, attract screws from father away, increase your score multiplier- aren't anything exciting, in my opinion.\n\nYou press the left mouse button to set your angle, then release to jump. You can cancel a jump by holding down the left mouse button long enough, so there's no sense of commitment when you pick an angle. As the speed of the planets and fireballs increases, you can repeatedly cancel angles that look bad without any apparent penalty (unless I'm missing something). It makes me wonder what will kill patient, precise players first: the fireballs, or boredom?\n\nNow, I bought this for $1, so you could argue I'm being awfully nitpicky at that price point, and I don't entirely disagree. Still, I think Beyond Gravity really lacks a sense of longevity. If more gameplay elements- planet types, obstacle types, powerups- were added, I'd consider changing my stance, but as of this writing I don't recommend it.","September 23, 2014","false","1.1"," 57 of 93 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","57","93","0","1"

Gravity is the only gameplay gimmick, though it doesn't play the role that it could if gameplay was expanded to offer different levels of gravity.  Instead you click when your character, on a rotating planet, is next to the next screw and they will jump directly onto the next planet.  Of course this gets slightly more difficult when the path of the screws is further away, but honestly, there is no difficulty level in this game, it is purely a casual click fest.

It feels like a Freemium grindfest that forgot the in-game store without adjusting the prices accordingly.\n\nIn addition, this may very well be one of the laziest mobile to PC ports I have ever seen. The PC version is identical to the Android version, it doesn't even have an exit button, nor does it react to the ESC key. There is, currently, no way to cleanly end this game - as a result (perhaps) resolution and graphic quality settings are never saved and one has to adjust them each time upon launch.\n\nEven at 99 cents, this is a waste of money.","October 1, 2014","false","10.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Examples:\n\nIt's not clear from out outset what you actually *do*\nIt's not clear that the spacebar is jump\nIt's not clear that the jump isn't "charging" as you hold it down, but is in fact simply delaying it.

We can jump backwards, but that doesn't matter, the streak is ended.\nDouble-jump doesn't behave *at all* as one would expect: the second jump completely ignores the momentum of the preceeding jump, such that jumping backwards to catch a missed bolt *will* cause you to die the first time you do it, since you'd expect to keep going backwards on the 2nd jump.\nTreating the lack of a "cancel jump" input as a feature is disingenuous. Please just don't.\nVery unhappy with the purchase, even for $1.

The object is to jump from one spinning planet to the next, while picking up as much junk as you can in between. You can spend your junk (screws and stuff) on upgrades to make the jumps a little easier and more effective at picking up more junk.\n\nThe graphics are cute, the music is bubbly, and the gameplay is really excellent. You'll catch on right away but mastering the jump angles and timing between planets, which are different sizes and rotate at different speeds and often in different directions, is a bit trickier and what makes Beyond Gravity worth playing.\n\nAddictive and really fun.

Unfortunately, Beyond Gravity was not that game.\n\nI guess I'll start with the good points. The art and sound assets are nice, and the port is competent, if bare-bones. The goals the game gives you are also a nice change of pace, giving you something to look forward to beyond just playing the game. The game is also extremely cheap, only a dollar on sale at the moment. Unfortunately, that's about all the nice things I can say about this game.\n\nThe gameplay is fun at first, but then you quickly realize that not only is there very little variety, the upgrade curve is all wrong. You can keep going and going and going, but it really doesn't provide you any benefit unless you manage to perfectly hit each and every screw to get the multiplier going up. In fact, several of the goals incentivize you to simply jump into the void at the very start of the game over and over again simply to get the deaths required to unlock the next one. And if you want to build that multiplier up, you're probably going to need to pick up some upgrades, which are frankly hideously expensive at the start. It should be the other way around: give you cheaper upgrades at the beginning to give you a feeling of progress as you move through through the unlock system. Instead, you'll be grinding out screws over and over and over again before you even get one. In about two hours of play, I unlocked two things. It's almost like it was built to sell in-app purchases in a mobile game. There are no such purchases, either on Steam or in the mobile version, which makes it only more bizarre.\n\nHard-to-acquire upgrades and little variety in gameplay make this hard to recommend. At a dollar I'd say you're right about getting your money's worth. The game has a fair amount of visual polish, but it's a shame there's not so much game behind it to encourage you to keep playing.","November 1, 2014","false","1.9"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","1"

With these parts you can buy several upgrades. A few are very useful, while others are pretty useless.\n\nYou can even get more parts with completing tasks. Each time you get 3 tasks to complete. When you completed them you get more parts and a new task in return. Completing all tasks is pretty easy, I did it in 4 hours of playtime. It is also an easy way to get 100% of all the achievements in game.\n\nThe best thing about this game is the replayability. If you fall down or jump straight into a fireball you start over. But without losing the parts or progress in the tasks. And when you had completed all the tasks you can do them all over again, to collect more upgrades for example.\n\nMy rating for this game: 7/10","May 29, 2015","true","5.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Found it in my library while looking for games with trading cards, found out the game itself is amusing. Its a combination of single-button runner-style game (where you run and jump) with a physics engine, which simulates gravity.\nIn short, you jump from planet to planet, collecting... bolts? And golden ones? It may not sound very amusing, but graphics are made in a cute (nice, interesting, fun) way, it looks good. Sound is also good, so overall the game is fun to play.\nThere is no "end-game", no boss and the game is infinite (as far as I can tell), but its well made and gives off a good feel.\n\nLoving it. Recommended if you're into one-button time-killers.\n\nThe only drawback: its kind of short, took me around 5 hours to complete.

One, not enough variety; two, the shop prices feel too high; three, there's little sense of risk.\n\nThe gameplay involves jumping from planet to planet while collecting screws and dodging fireballs that travel up and down. That's a nice foundation, but it's all there is. If you can line yourself up and time your jumps properly, you can go on for dozens of minutes in a single run and not see anything new besides planets, screws, and the occasional group of fireballs. It would have been nice to see different types of obstacles, planets, or powerups, especially once you survive past the first few minutes.\n\nMy first run lasted around twenty minutes, and I managed to collect around 10,000 screws. Not bad, right? Actually, that was barely enough to buy the cheapest item at the shop, and all it did was increase my jump speed slightly. Many items cost at least 30,000 screws, which equates to at least an hour of playtime at my speed. When you consider how repetitive the gameplay can be, that feels way too long.\n\nThere are optional challenges you can complete, but I've gone through around 25% of them, and so far the payouts don't seem to exceed 1,000 - 2,000 screws. Maybe the later ones are better, but some of them are rather tedious (play 30 games), and you can only pursue three at a time. Keep in mind that most of the shop items themselves- jump faster, attract screws from father away, increase your score multiplier- aren't anything exciting, in my opinion.\n\nYou can cancel a jump by holding down the left mouse button long enough, so there's no sense of commitment when you pick an angle. As the speed of the planets and fireballs increases, you can repeatedly cancel angles that look bad without any apparent penalty (unless I'm missing something). It makes me wonder what will kill patient, precise players first: the fireballs, or boredom?\n\nNow, I bought this for $1, so you could argue I'm being awfully nitpicky at that price point, and I don't entirely disagree. Still, I think Beyond Gravity really lacks a sense of longevity. If more gameplay elements- planet types, obstacle types, powerups- were added, I'd consider changing my stance, but as of this writing I don't recommend it.","September 23, 2014","false","1.1"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

All he wanted to do was go out for a spot of space dogging, drop off at the space pub on his way home, have a few space pints, then go home and ignore his space wife before calling it a night. But he's only gone and fallen asleep at the wheel like a stupid c*nt and crashed into an asteroid, completely destroying his space car and writing off his no claims bonus in the process. What a stupid c*nt.\n\nNow you'll have to help him jump from rotating planetoid to planetoid, timing the jumps carefully so he can collect screws and cogs littered between them in convenient arcs whilst making sure he doesn't fly off into the vast void of space or hit any hazards along the way. Do this for as far as you can, collecting as many pieces as you can, use these pieces to upgrade your look or abilities, then go back to the start and do it all over again. It's essentially an endless jumper. But not the kind you wear, coz that'd just be mad, you crazy b*stard.\n\nIt's literally one-button gameplay as you hit the space bar (waheeey!) to jump, or hold it down to ready your next perilous leap. You can also double jump and later upgrade to a triple jump, but that's pretty much the only nuance to this game that's all about timing and little else. It has a pretty nice, if uncomplicated, look about it, and the audio is perfectly adequate without ever being spectacular. Which basically sums up this whole game.\n\nWith only one mode and relatively little replay value beyond high scores or easy (if not mildly time-consuming) achievements, this won't hold your attention for any great length of time, which is reflected in the price. But I still thoroughly enjoyed that short time with this since it served as a nice break of mindless fun between greater, more demanding games, coz sometimes it's nice to just do a few space jumps for a while without having to worry about anything else. Though I do worry about what his space wife will say once she learns what Jeff's done to their no claims bonus. Oh, poor Jeff.

You jump from planet to planet collecting screws and dodging fireballs. Very simple and easy. It is also entertaining. Really enjoyed the game while it lasted. Had fun trying to get all achievements. Unfortunately, once you get the achievements, the game looses its purpose. Why keep playing it if you have nothing else to achieve? If there's no end? It can be a good time killer or become boring very fast. Paid 1 buck for the game and got 3 cards plus 40 achievements. I believe it's worth, especially because I did have 5 hours of fun.

I mean all you do is jump from planet to planet, avoiding fireballs and collecting screws. But once you start playing it, you'll find a pretty fun game and time-killer. Aside from the screw collecting, you also do simple challenges to get bonus screws (Everything from Collecting X Amount Of Gold Screws to, I kid you not, Dying In A Game X Amount Of Times). Those screws then can be use to purchase power-ups (like Triple-Jump and a magnet) to simple cosmetic items. Yes, this game isn't for everyone, but if you want something different to play that won't tax your paients, then I highly recommend you get this game! As a side-note, if you do happen buy the game, be sure to quit, when you are done playing, via the main menu and NOT by pressing the X button in the window. It can glitch the game to where you can't do the challenges and have to reset the entire game.","October 2, 2014","true","5.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's an obvious mobile port: it only has one button and the intro video even says "Tap to continue" instead of "click." While it may seem a little rushed or lazy, that doesn't deter from the game.\n\nFirst, it's cheap. Lists for $2, but whenever it goes on sale it's an easy decision to buy. The point of the game is to jump from planet to planet, collecting as many screws as you can. There are 40 goals/ achievements, all of which can be obtained fairly reasonably.\n\nPROS\n+ The game is fun and has a good balance between being simple and challenging.\n+ The game is inexpensive.\n+ It is really easy to get 100% of the achievements in a short amount of time.\n\nCONS\n- The game is short. I got everything in just over three hours, you could do it in less.\n- Limited replayablity. Once you've gotten all the tasks/ achievements, there's not a ton of incentive to play more. There are skins and additional skills, but you can do everything without them, leaving little incentive to push to collect them.\n- Some of the tasks are more of a grind than anything else. They don't involve any skill per se, just jumping or dying over and over until you hit the number.\n\nAll in all, I would most certainly recommend the game. It's simple, it's fun, it's something those of you with small children can play with your kids. I would suggest you get it on sale, although $2 is far from unreasonable. I would give it a 7/10.","October 2, 2014","true","3.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Overall I think it's worth the price by far and it's a great game just to waste some time on.","April 2, 2015","true","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is pretty simple and easy to get into, maybe it could get a little repetitive at times but it´s good to play in short intervals so you won´t get totally bored. Also, the achievements are a great way to keep you going and the difficult ones give sweet rewards.\nThe only thing i didn´t like was that you had only access to 3 achievements at the time and you have to complete them for more to appear so... it´s kind of frustrating when you get to the "land on 1000 planets" at the end when previously you probably already did that but you didnt have access to it so it is from 0 in the moment you access.\n\nAside from that little detail, it was pretty fun and I´m gonna keep at it until i have all the upgrades.","March 26, 2015","true","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's certainly competent in its execution, but the unlocks are extremely overpriced (in terms of in-game currency - don't worry, there's no "cash shop" or anything of the like). I can't fathom playing this game often enough to end up with the amount of bolts necessary.\n\nNot a huge fan of games based on multipliers, either - it makes a single mistake in the early-mid game seem overly punishing, forcing you to choose between suffering through the skull-numbing tedium of the early hops again just to build multiplier, or continuing on when you know the more difficult parts may make building multiplier a futile dream.\n\nWhen all's said and done, it's in that 50-60% of my scale that's like 70-80 in idiotically-inflated "Game Critic Numbers", and since the Steam category is reasonably appropriate (I was half-expecting this to be in "Simulator" like seemingly every other casual indie game with a vaguely sci-fi theme is these days), I'll give it the thumbs-up.

This is a given with most mobile ports anyway so whatever.\nThe way Achievements work is also brought over from mobile:\n\nUpon completing a Challenge that the game sets for you, you get another to do. You have three active challenges at a time.\nWhether you'd made some progress towards that new challenge doesn't matter- you can't start the game and immediately die three times to get that Achievement, you have to wait unti the game makes that Achievement one of your active challenges.\nVery interesting; this adds further to grinding, but if you just concentrate specifically on those challenges when they're given you, you can get some grindy ones and work towards those Achievements, so as to lessen the amount of tedium.\n\nThe other issue (which, again, is carried over from mobile) is that the menu doesn't respond well to a scrolling mouse-wheel so you have to drag.\n\n\nThis is (probably) the mobile port that feels most like a mobile port while on PC without that necessarily being a bad thing.\n\n\nThe game is mindnumbing and I suck at it. It is (")fun(") and addicting.

However, most people will get bored after one hour, so if I were the people who didn't enjoy these as much as I do, then I would get it on sale.\n\nI personally give it a 7/10, because at first, I was charmed by the classic casual gameplay, I always enjoyed playing a little of this at a time, and saving up all the screws to buy pretty cool stuff. In the beginning though, I get maybe 800 screws a game on average, and the first item is 10,000 screws. I thought it was really expensive for the first item, but I enjoy the challenge of "planet hopping" enough to keep playing to buy that item.\n\nHowever, after an hour or so, the game becomes INCREDIBLY grind-y where the missions can be like "Land on 500 planets" along with "Have a near miss with 15 fireballs (which is not easy)" and even just getting gears takes a while, maybe if the devs would tone down the prices, then this would be a better experience.","September 24, 2014","true","1.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

I would highly recommend to the fans of this genre despite this game has a serious annoyance: the achievement can only be gathered in the order the game offers them. For example, no matter I gained a 100× multiplier before, I have to make it again when this is the next to achieve. My last one to achieve was to hop on 1000 planets which was extremely boring in the end ("Redoing" archievements again as I surely did that already thoughout the game.)\n\nIt would be also good if in the menu the player could navigate with the arrow buttons and using Enter. Now the keyboard mapping is restricted to Spacebar which is the only "button combo" you need to remember. :)\n\nMy overall score for the game is 8/10.","November 7, 2014","true","3.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

One, not enough variety; two, the shop prices feel too high; three, there's little sense of risk.\n\nThe gameplay involves jumping from planet to planet while collecting screws and dodging fireballs that travel up and down. That's a nice foundation, but it's all there is. If you can line yourself up and time your jumps properly, you can go on for dozens of minutes in a single run and not see anything new besides planets, screws, and the occasional group of fireballs. It would have been nice to see different types of obstacles, planets, or powerups, especially once you survive past the first few minutes.\n\nMy first run lasted around twenty minutes, and I managed to collect around 10,000 screws. Not bad, right? Actually, that was barely enough to buy the cheapest item at the shop, and all it did was increase my jump speed slightly. Many items cost at least 30,000 screws, which equates to at least an hour of playtime at my speed. When you consider how repetitive the gameplay can be, that feels way too long.\n\nThere are optional challenges you can complete, but I've gone through around 25% of them, and so far the payouts don't seem to exceed 1,000 - 2,000 screws. Maybe the later ones are better, but some of them are rather tedious (play 30 games), and you can only pursue three at a time. Keep in mind that most of the shop items themselves- jump faster, attract screws from father away, increase your score multiplier- aren't anything exciting, in my opinion.\n\nYou can cancel a jump by holding down the left mouse button long enough, so there's no sense of commitment when you pick an angle. As the speed of the planets and fireballs increases, you can repeatedly cancel angles that look bad without any apparent penalty (unless I'm missing something). It makes me wonder what will kill patient, precise players first: the fireballs, or boredom?\n\nNow, I bought this for $1, so you could argue I'm being awfully nitpicky at that price point, and I don't entirely disagree. Still, I think Beyond Gravity really lacks a sense of longevity. If more gameplay elements- planet types, obstacle types, powerups- were added, I'd consider changing my stance, but as of this writing I don't recommend it.","September 23, 2014","false","1.1"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

And I don't have a problem with the wacky physics or the idea of jumping from planet to planet.\nWhat I cant forgive is that it's absolutely boring. You wait and hit space.

There seems to be a "story" there about collecting screws and gears (which float in space between the planets) to fix your rocket, but there's no goal, no progress, no nothing, just collecting the stuff and trying to cover as much distance as you can. It even fails as an upgrade game, since you have to wait forever to earn an upgrade: the cheapest one is 10000 and you make hundreds in a single run. No, thanks. If you're really bored out of your skull and don't know how to kill time, watch your country's government on live TV, it will be better than this.\nAlso, if you make a little launcher app to lauch your game, at least make it remember my settings, so I don't have to change them every time I start.","August 29, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This feels like a mobile game. For some reason, collecting the screws and gears reminds me of collecting rings on sonic. You constantly progress no matter what you do so its a pretty easy game. But its up to you how long it takes. The farther you get the harder the level becomes. Very charming. Dont let the cover fool you its actually pretty cool!","March 14","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is one function: click(or space, depending on your playstyle) to jump in between planets. You jump in the direction of your head. That direction changes because the planets spin, like in real life, except not really. Also you can hold space to stop the planets rotation and get time to hink if you really want to jump there. If you don't want to, just wait a while and you dont have to jump after all. Repeat until victory or death.\n\nAlso, upgrades.\n\nPlay this game, but get it on your phone rather than on steam because it's cheaper but provides the same experience, and then your friends can't see how much of your life you've wasted.\n\n10/10","July 14, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's simple to play too, which is awesome for if you just want something laid-back to play with half a brain and one hand. It's cheap. It's easy to get 100% achievements. And you can choose from different heads and bodies for your character. Instead of the astronaut, you can play as a steampunk zombie or a skeleton bike baron. So that's a bonus. 8/10","June 13, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Decent and easy-on-the-eyes graphics, quiet music.\n\nThe only downfall is that I agree with the people who don't recommend this for one simple reason: it's lacking.\nIt could have been a bit better-- there are only two ways to die in the game, either falling or getting hit by a fireball. And theirs only about as much upgrades and you can  count on both hands. Others also said that a leaderboard would have been nice?\n\nAll in all I say it was worth the dollar I spent. The non-sale price is just a /bit/ much other than that-- I can't geniunely complain about this cute little time waster. [:","June 11, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, the basic action never changes.  It is timing a jump off a rotating planet.  After a few hours and completing enough goals to improve your "ship" to where it shows just where you should jump, it becomes easier, not more fun.  You can hold your jump so as to not hit the fireball, but if you start your jump wrong you have to wait for it to wear off and spin around again, which is annoying.  There is no real skill involved, no progression, and the goals which just give you bonus screws, eventually just repeat and are only good for cosmetic changes to the ship.  I got bored before getting  that far.  So I guess it's worth half a buck or whatever, but just barely.","January 12","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The simple gameplay is challenging and forgiving in equal measure and the simple graphics look good and run smoothly on even the most weedy of setups.\n\nAs a negative point, I feel that this game would perhaps be better suited to android or ios, owing to its timewaster nature, but that said, for a pound sixty, you get a pretty fun little game that runs smoothly and presents an interesting little addition to your steam library if you're into platformers and less intensive games.","January 23","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You will need to spend about 2-3 hours to unlock everything and complete all the objectives.\n\nAll you have to do is jump from planet to planet, predicting your jump course to not only not fall off, but also to catch all the nuts and bolts placed sequentially in between them, building up your combo multiplyer.\n\nIt appears to be a mobile port, which for some reason, puts people off (maybe the price difference?) but it has the standard unity launcher with resolution options. I noticed some frame drops, but that rarely happened.","June 19, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
