Let's start with the big white elephant in the room. Is this pay to win? No, it's pay to convenience.\n\nPay to ConvenienceThe RL cash shop (EnMasse Store - EME Store) is generally costumes. Costumes, everywhere. There's also a premium "Elite Status" as well, which doubles your monster kill experience (not quests), quest gold and faction reputation/credit gains - the last one is especially useful. Sure, it sells certain things that will speed your ingame play along, but nothing you can't farm with relative ease. More on that in a moment, need to describe enchantment of gear in this game, which is generally why some games are labelled P2W.\n\nEnchantment system is divided into 2 types of materials - Alkahest and Feedstock. Alkahest is that magical glue, for lack of a better description, and feedstock is the fodder you throw onto the pile. It's straightforward until you have a +9 weapon - and while levelling that's all you need. Once you hit endgame, its time to go hard or be labelled a filthy casual. Most groups in the LFG chat channel will have a +12 DPS requirement, meaning your weapon has to be +12 or nuts to you. Now you need a couple more things - first, you need to Masterwork the item (done at roughly 5% rate through Masterwork Enigmatic Scrolls, 10% through Blessed Enigmatic Scrolls or 100% through Noble Enigmatic Scrolls. Last two are EME shop only.) then you need to use large amounts of masterwork level alkahest (Masterwork Alkahest/Extensive/Premium - note that premium is not 100% chance). You can either be insanely lucky, +12ing your entire item with no fails from +0 through to +12, or you can cry as you burn some 2,000 feedstock and ~600 alkahest on a single item. Not to mention the masterwork rate is obviously low. +12 is considered the MAINSTREAM mind you, especially if you only have a single character. From personal experience, could take a week or so to +12 a character's gear completely.\n\nSo back on that P2W thing - it's really not. I can't stress this enough. You can farm all that alkahest, MES and feedstock pretty fast. I get over 1,200 feedstock a day, and I'm not really farming it - it's a BONUS for what I'm actually farming. Gold is easy to make and there's an ingame Trade Broker (or auction house or whatever you wanna call it) that lets people with too much RL money and too little time on their hands sell stuff to us poor folk with too much time on our hands. The market prices fluctuate wildly at times for some items (for example Noble Enigmatic Scrolls went from 25k to 15k in two nights) based on supply and demand. As a well established endgamer, I've got the ability to make around 30-50k on a big sale of crafted items through the broker at least once or twice a week. It takes a bit of time to get established, but its not THAT hard.\n\nGameplay\n*cough*\n\nThis isn't WoW. It sure as hell isn't Final Fantasy XIV ARR. There will be no standing still, tab targetted on a monster and mashing your "1" key repeatedly. At least, not if you want to live, not get kicked from a party and earn a reputation as trash. :'D\n\nYour character gains skills (and improves them) as you gain levels as well as Glyphs and Glyph Points. Glyphs augment your skills, improving an aspect or giving them entirely new effects. For example, a warrior could spend 5 glyph points to grant 25% chance for Rising Fury to reset (a critical glyph as a DPS build). Your glyph points are equivalent to (player level)-10 and you start getting them at level 20.\n\nYou may (should!) customize your gear with crystals. Your weapons can have stuff like increased critical chance while your armor can bear more health or reduced monster damage. Your gear will also have rolls ("stats" in TERA parlance) that affect its performance, similar to crystals. Unlike crystals, you can reroll these stats to suit your tastes. Crystals aren't permanent or item bound, so at least you can move them around.\n\nYour equipment varies based on class. There are 4 Plate users, 4 Leather users and 3 Cloth users.\nLancer - Plate, Tank Class.\nBrawler - Plate, Tank Class.\nBerserker - Plate, Burst DPS class. Can tank at 65.\nGunner - Plate, Sustained Ranged DPS class.\nArcher - Leather, Burst Ranged DPS class. Game considers it sustained - it's not.\nReaper - Leather, Hybrid DPS class. BEST PvE DPS, PvP focused class. [SPC]\nSlayer - Leather, Sustained Melee DPS class.\nWarrior - Leather, Sustained Melee DPS class OR Tank class.*\nSorcerer - Cloth, Burst Ranged DPS class. CAN be sustained with the right setup.\nPriest - Cloth, Burst Healer class. Poor support.\nMystic - Cloth, Healer** class. Excellent support.\n\n\n[SPC] Reaper starts at lvl 50 but requires an existing lvl 40 to roll.\n*Despite its learning curve, the warrior is potentially a MUCH better tank than Lancer. I have no issues surviving anything PvE related to Warrior that my lancer may have issues with. The amount of iframes (invulnerability frames - split seconds where you are invincible due to skill use) the warrior has more than makes up for the slightly reduced armor.\n**Mystic isnt as powerful as a priest in terms of healing. Instead it's significantly more mobile and bears a lot of support abilities such as crowd control skills and superb MP restoration. Auras and Thralls are also fun.\n\nPvE\nIt's not as hard as it used to be, not by a long shot. Hasn't been hard for years to be honest. Previously, one wrong step in a Hardmode dungeon would result in you dying horribly (or amusingly, depending on what you just did n_n) but now it's...forgiving? I don't know if that's the right word. The dungeons and bosses before had tons of mechanics which you had to do specifically (check out Manaya's Core Hardmode on youtube) but now...it's like the developers got lazy. The fights are really heavily gear dependant. Previously I'd tank hardmodes with gear from the previous expansion block. Now, trying to do that gets me killed pretty damn quickly. It's a joke to be honest. Not to say it doesn't have its moments, but it simply lacks the flair and difficulty it had 2 years ago in the favor of less mechanics, more gear dependancy.\n\nPvP\nOh, this is amusing. Until you get to endgame, expect to be turned into - to quote the Bloody Mess perk of the Fallout franchise - an eyeball strewn, gut-ridden paste. Fun! There's only one difference between PvP and PvE servers - open world PvP. On PvP servers, gamers looking to get an epeen extention will happily camp lowbie areas, making your lives hell until you figure out how to change from Channel 1 to Channel Anything-but-1.\n\nSo. PvP. There's a number of Battlegrounds available (instanced PvP dungeons) with the majority being available ONLY to endgamers - and thank god for that. Remember glyphs from earlier? Missing the higher level skills, crystals and glyphs means that for the lowbie BG (Corsair's Stronghold), an endgamer will turn you into an eyeball strewn-...you get the point.\n\nEnd NoteThere's only so much I can cram into this steam review panel. For more in-depth stuff, refer to a guide or poke my characters on Tempest Reach. My most well known has my Steam account named after it. *points at name*\n\nRandom fact: High ping (e.g. Australia, like me) is okay for anything (tanking, pvp, healing) in this game. You'll still get steamrolled by pro pvpers with 20ms ping though, but those are few and far between.\n\nPS: Forgot to put this in the initial review; EnMasse Entertainment is great support, really friendly bunch. They actually READ your support tickets instead of seeing keywords and copy-pasting a premade reply like most companies and will happily fix your mistakes (oops, discarded/sold a ring I was actually using! D:) if you ask them.","May 8, 2015","true","726.0"," 1,340 of 1,432 people (94%) found this review helpful 202 people found this review funny","94","340","1","202","51"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/norisaur/recommended/323370/","norisaur","Ashe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/norisaur/","225 products in account","Ah, where to begin with this game. I've been playing it for at least 2-3 weeks now, and as someone who wasted their life away on WoW for 4+ years straight, and who is very iffy and skeptical of "F2P" games, my experience has been enjoyable. Going to review the main parts of the game that I feel make it stand out from other F2P games.\n\nGraphics and overall design - The game is visually stunning. No other way to describe it. The graphics, the scenery, the character design are all gorgeous as hell. The character creation/customization is also quite amazing and if you're like me you'll find yourself engrossed in making your characters for long periods of time. Granted, a lot of the armor designs are over-the-top and sexualized, but that goes for both the female and male armor. The male Castanic's armor designs are a fine example of that. But hey, everyone likes eyecandy right? And they even have some for the ladies!\n\nCombat - The combat is super fun and engaging, as well as satisfying. You have to actually aim your abilities and a lot of the time it's while you're on the move. It can be a little weird to adjust to, at least it was for me (Again, I came from WoW), but it's very easy to pick up. Even as a tank, you have to watch the mobs your fighting and time your blocks properly. It's a lot different from other MMO's, where most of the time it's just target + hit your skill button. You get a lot of abilities you can use, but you can link them together via combos, where you can do your rotations in order via using your spacebar. Makes it a little easier if you get overwhelmed by all the stuff you have at your disposal.\n\nF2P and Elite Status - The big part for me. TERA is a F2P game with an item shop and optional "Elite" status (AKA the subscription plan). When I started playing the game, and even later on, I never felt like I needed to buy anything in the item shop to progress. Everything in the shop are cosmetic items and items for convenience. Certainly not "pay-to-win". This is what attracts me to the game the most. Granted, I did eventually start up a subscription, but that was because I enjoy the game just that much. You don't have any real advantages as an elite member from what I have seen, just convenience and a neat mount. Everything in the item shop can be bought through in-game currency via the player marketplace, including 30 and 60-day vouchers for elite status. So technically, you don't even need to pay actual money for stuff in the item shop or for elite status if you decided to go that route. Overall the F2P system on this game is very fair and will not make your characters stronger and won't make you feel like you /have/ to buy things in the item shop in order to get anywhere. Item shops are usually the make-or-break for a lot of F2P games, and TERA has perfected it.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game if you want super engaging combat, beautiful graphics and character design, and a F2P system that doesn't make you feel forced to buy anything from the item shop. The leveling can be a bit of a grind after a point (It's a Korean MMO, after all), and sometimes the community can be a bit weird (Particularly about goats and Elins), but if you can tolerate those things then by all means give it a shot. You won't regret it!\n\n**EDIT**\n\nSo I have been getting a large influx of friend requests, which is okay and all as I enjoy meeting new people. However, if you are only adding me to ask about TERA or to try and play it with me, I would rather you didn't. You can find more than enough information on their website, and I'm more than happy to answer your questions in the comments below. I don't have as much time to dedicate to the game as I did when I made this review, so if you're looking to try and play it with me it will be difficult. Very sorry for this.","July 19, 2015","true","491.3"," 613 of 635 people (97%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","97","613","635","45","16"

It is also frequented by many players who MMO hop looking for anything free to entertain them. That's what I used to do, until Tera got me hooked.\n\nTera initially had 8 classes, and has since added two new classes, and had an official expansion (Fate of Arun) on top of multiple content updates (Fane of Kaprima, Wonderholme, Wounded World, etc.)\n\nThe biggest strength of Tera and what sets it apart from other MMOs is its action combat.  There's no tab-targeting here, most skills require you to understand their hitboxes in order to land (the exception being some lock-on skills). Every class has a reticle in the middle of your screen so you know where you are aiming.\n\nTera runs in Unreal Engine 3, but the developers did a fantastic job to create the vibrant fantasy world of Arborea. The first time I entered Heartwood around level 40, it totally blew me away with how beautiful it was.\n\nThe developer of Tera, Bluehole Studios, is based in South Korea - and Tera is distributed with many publishers around the world. However, for this version of Tera (NA Tera), one of the best parts about Tera is the publisher, En Masse Entertainment. They do a good job of listening to the feedback of their players and adjusting the game to keep everything as balanced as possible.\n\nA lot of current players get asked the question "It Tera worth it? Is it worth my time having already been released for so long?" I highly recommend everyone spend a little time playing Tera, it is worth your time.\n\n[edit to fix typo - Fane of Kaprima]","May 5, 2015","true","870.8"," 563 of 619 people (91%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","91","563","619","39","39"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Opaque_spin/recommended/323370/","Opaque_spin","][-=Rez=-][","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Opaque_spin/","135 products in account","TERA is:\nNOT Pay2Win\nNOT stiff or clunky\nFun\nFREE\nEasy to get into\nBalanced (at least as far as PVE goes)\n\nBut really, The game's good. Unlike other MMOs like say, WoW where you can pump stats  and become practically untouchable as you stand still while the game dictates whether you dodge or not. You actually have to evade attacks yourself. The stats only control your damage output and some damage mitigation as well as resistance to knockdown (your worst enemy for any class). You want an XP boost? either get it from the game store OR the in game vendor that takes federation bills, which you get 5 of each day.\n\nA few things about certain classes:\n\nBERSERKER- If you're making a Berserker, fighting BAMs will be the most annoying thing to deal with at early levels, since you'll spend most of the fight blocking, though it depends how fast and mobile the particular BAM is, but yeah, its better to team up with someone that can distract the BAM so you can get the maximum damage out (Berserkers have the highest single hit burst damage in the game, properly specced out you can take a solid chunk out of a boss's health bar, compared to the steady bits going away when the entire group's beating on it. Also, if all goes right, bring someone to tears in PVP). I say this because zerkers lack real mobility like the other classes have, so you'll notice it takes longer to down a BAM solo,  compared to other classes.\n\nWARRIOR- If you want a challenge, try learning to be an evasive tank on Warrior. Their offense is excellent, I'd even say easy, but trying to tank when you know the boss/room full of minions can blow you up since you're wearing leather, plus dishing out damage is a nice balancing act.\n\nMYSTIC- send pet, use damage spells, pet dies, put enemy to sleep, resummon pet and repeat. Personally I only find this class fun in dungeons since you can't use the tanking pet in there (unless you're soloing a group dungeon), it screws up the Tank's mojo and also pulls extra aggro when you're trying to be sneaky.\n\nGUNNER- I'd have to say this is the easiest class in the game. You get dodge on a 5 second timer that has a chance to not trigger the cooldown timer, plus a rocket jump for extra mobility, a grenade that stuns, a bot that heals you and a proximity turret. Believe me, this is the most newbie friendly class in the game. and one of the few classes that can take advantage of "more damage from behind" bonuses when standing right in front of the enemy.....When you see their moveset, you'll see what I'm talking about.\n\nREAPER- The stunlock king. You get 3 stuns, a counter attack, an attack that spaces you quite a ways away from the target AND the ability to cheat death. So unless you're going after some really mobile and hard hitting BAMs you can go from fight to fight with little to no breaks in between.\n\n*haven't tried archer,  priest or Lancer and retired my sorcerer early to make the mystic\n\nI can't stress it enough, if you like MMOs and action games, you'll love this. They don't keep the good stuff behind a pay wall, it's completely optional unless you like to customize or collect mounts/pets.","May 23, 2015","true","246.8"," 286 of 313 people (91%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","91","286","313","19","8"

Absolutely gorgeous graphics and art design. Combat is much more satisfying than any MMO I've played. Great fun classes.\n\nThe whole Elin obsession thing is still pretty weird to me but to each his own since I do love playing badass female characters, I just don't see what the Elin appeal is, I think the majority of it is players just want to have a badass cutsy character.\n\nThe story to me is pretty bad but I've been somewhat spoiled coming from SWtOR where they actuall tell you the story. Characters that seem important seem to pop up out of nowhere and there is little in the way of character development. Although when you get into the overall story of fighting the war it is pretty cool but smaller side things are confusing, cutscenes are LESS than mediocre.\nMissions and quest are equally bad, 90% kill fetch quests, although the kill quests are somewhat offset by the combat being so much fun. Crafting is overly complicated, tedious, time consuming and boring, you literally cant do ANYTHING while crafting but stare at your screen, may as well alt tab out for about 10 minutes. however again this is offset somewhat by the fact that you can craft end-game gear and make VERY good money from crafting.\n\nThe subscription model is just OK, could be a ton better but it definately has it's perks especially during leveling.\nI haven't really run into a great number of toxic players and most times I've been matched in a dungeon players have been polite and helpful, the general chat is of couse garbage, haven't been in an MMO yet where it hasen't been, but this  is typically a small percentage of morons who have nothing better to do than spit vomit in chat, the people actually playing the game don't bother.\n\nConstant news and stream from the publisher and the devs seem ok at keeping up with the community, not 100% but better than some games I've played.\n\nAll said and done I'd give it a 8/10 fun game and awesome to look at, great combat.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shad0wriderz/recommended/323370/","shad0wriderz","W r a i t h","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shad0wriderz/","225 products in account","TERA has exactly what you would expect from a Korean MMORPG, which is not really a bad thing depending on your preferences of course.\n\n1. Great combat system. Yes, the famous true combat system that the TERA developers and fanbase brag about all the time. Is it good? Well, yes, it's the best in its class (at least until other KMMOs like Black Desert step in and try to dethrone it from the NA market). Other MMOs only try to match TERA fluid combat system. The only other games I know of that exist right now that can even come close are RaiderZ (combat is the only thing going for that) and C9. So what is the system? No tab-targetting, aimed attacked, combos, dodging, fluid transitions between skills, ooohhhhh it's really something you have to try for yourself.\n\n2. Lots of grinding. Well, it's a Korean MMO after all and where would a Korean MMO be without lots of farming and grinding. That's definitely something that puts the combat system to the test now isn't it? Something I really like about TERA is the enemy variety within a single area. You'll have enemies where you'll be bursting down, then dodging while waiting for cooldowns just to burst again moments later.  You'll have enemies you can beat in only one string of skills. There's a third kind which dies in generally one hit. REALLY, JUST ONE HIT!!!!!! Considering nowadays most MMOs consist of you repeatedly ripping into enemies while fun numbers appear of their heads over and over until they finally die and you're left exhausted and bored,  grinding in TERA is a breath of fresh air. So farm to your hearts content, because it's way better than in most games.\n\n3. Waifus? Well again, Korean MMO, so obviously you'll be trying to make the sexiest character possible. There's some presets as always, but then comes the sliders for adjusting ears and nose bridges and mouth position and all that stuff you either love or dread at the start of an MMO. Essentially, there's decent customization for your waifu making pleasure. Lots of armor sets, again focused towards making waifus which I'm sure you would have expected by now.\n\n4. Cash shop are usually handled moderately well in most Korean MMOs, at least the ones that I've played (except for the post-2010 p2w deathtrap known as Maplestory among others). Lots of cosmetics, you know, to enhance the waifu experience of course. You could become an elite member where you pay a fee and get more XP and discounts at the EMP store if you want, but that's not anything p2w. Leveling isn't that hard that this XP boosts become unfair, and 2x XP events aren't that uncommon either. They also sell the usual, character slots, gender changes, facial changes, some keys to open chests (praying to RNGesus for days), mounts, pets. But nothing bad nothing to ruin any f2p players experiences.\n\n5. PvE vs. PvP server: The PvE server is your traditional MMO server where you aren't beating noobs to a pulp as they try to do quests. You can play in PvP matches separately from all the PvE content just like your typical MMO. PvP servers, watch out noobs because some people just like it best when your precious waifu is dead on the floor while they laugh and wait for more noobs come. Yeah, you can see how that's turning out. It's a real fun and different experience worth checking out once you've hit max level in a PvE server or think you're good enough to meet the challenge.\n\n6. Endgame content? Well, they have more quests, PvP, dungeons, grinding for end game gear, the usual stuff. Enough content to keep players going but I won't go in-depth on that mainly because I never focus on doing endgame content in MMOs aside from dungeons and a bit of PvP from time to time. They have a great little guide on endgame content over on the TERA website for you.\n\n7. Economy-wise, I don' think making money is too difficult in TERA. Even at early levels, you'll be finding items you can sell for like 100 gold (uses the copper, silver, gold currency system) at the brokerage (basically an auction house, trading post, nothing new here). You'll easily be able to afford anything you require at your level until you start looking for rarer items. You think 100 gold is a lot? Well, when a guy walks around with like 50,000 gold then you'll see how insignificant your stash is. However, you'll never feel like you're ever lacking funds, until you start looking for rarer stuff.","May 5, 2015","true","70.1"," 228 of 260 people (88%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","88","228","260","29","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/323370/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nTERA is an MMORPG developed by Bluehole Studio and released in North America in 2012. You play TERA in third person view, have a choice between 9+ Classes, 7+ playable races, and level 60+ content (level cap increased to 65 for Fate of Arun Update).\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: You can go look up the official plot given on the TERA website, here's what most experienced mmorpg players will get while playing the game: "blah blah blah, go kill that thing because he looked at my friend weird. Blah blah blah, pick all of these things off the ground. Blah blah blah, go talk to that guy over there, because my kneecaps are broken."\nIf you skip the quest-text, the story is still pretty good; there are a few cutscenes that break up the monotony of the quest and NPC grinding. The basic story that you will already find out for yourself after getting out of the starting area, is that; you're a new hero who's just "helping out" and gets suckered into the wild-and-beautiful-lands that is TERA.\n\nGame Play: I fancy myself a fairly well versed MMORPG player, naturally there are many more hardcore MMORPG gamers out there, but I feel like I can consider myself as a bit of an authority on run-of-the-mill MMORPG mechanics. (And of course, an Achiever)\n\nWhat does TERA do the same as other MMO's, in terms of mechanics? Tank, healer, Range/Melee DPS, roles. Much of TERA is played very much like other MMORPG's out there; items, potions, crafting, auction house, mail, dungeons, PvP, duels, quests, daily quests, friend list, and many other features - many Keybindings are the same as they are in other MMO's.\n\nWhat does TERA do differently? The game does what I feel an MMO must: it makes you feel small, and makes the world feel big. There have been many moments while playing TERA that I said "WOA, that HUGE monster almost squashed me, good thing I dodged just in the nick-of-time!"\nTERA does not support tab-targeting and auto-firing, in other words, if you're an archer; you need to point your character in the direction you want to shoot and aim at your target. Melee it's similar in that you need to face the direction you intend to attack, and healing you need to similarly aim at your target.\nWhat does this feature mean? It actually forces players to be more aware of their surroundings and environment. Instead of tab targeting and watching health bars, you need to know where you are in proximity to your allies and enemies.\n\nAchievements: There are no Steam achievements for TERA, however like all good MMORPG's, TERA has it's own achievement reward system... it's the achievement hunters paradise; there are many achievements in game that award titles, mounts, and various other items and aesthetics.\n\nPrice Now we come to the best part, this game is free to play, you are limited on character slots per server, auction house items you can post and a few other features. I've played a few MMORPG's that are Free to Play, but normally they; make progressing grindingly slow, limit your currency, level cap, or all of the aforementioned!\nThere are many things you can purchase from the TERA store for aesthetics or character slots, or even purchase some of these through Steam. I personally would suggest showing support for the game if you enjoy it!\n\nConclusion: There are really only a few more things to mention before my conclusion: be mindful TERA is quite a large download, so that could steer some people away from it, due to hard drive or internet speed restrictions. Additionally, the graphics and game environment is quite dazzling if you can run TERA on higher systems.\n\nWho would this game appeal to most? The best stereotype would probably be MMORPG and RPG gamers, but I think that a free-to-play like TERA would be a good introduction for anyone who is new to MMORPG games. The UI can be a bit daunting at first, but there are guides available to explain what does what and even a built in tutorial/help menu.\n\nI highly recomend this game, and will personally be spending many hours playing it.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update May 08, 2015:\nadded "Quests" to "Same as other MMO's"","May 6, 2015","true","38.5"," 163 of 183 people (89%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","89","163","183","14","16"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/323370/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","TERA isn't a World of Warcraft killer, but it's not just another World of Warcraft ripoff, either. It's more like a World of Warcraft supplement, or a World of Warcraft successor: If you enjoy WoW and are up for a change of pace, TERA will be perfect for you. Most of it will feel immediately familiar, but there are enough changes to keep you interested, and all of the adjustments are for the better. It's basically Saint's Row to WoW's Grand Theft Auto. You should never forget where it came from, but it's a step in the right direction.\n\nNearly all the basic infrastructure here is stolen directly from World of Warcraft. You're given a constant barrage of quests to accomplish—kill this, fetch that—and in the process you explore new areas one by one. You can team up with other players to take on dungeons and bosses that are too powerful for you. You collect new gear and sell your old stuff. You craft items you can't find. Even the color palette, the creature design, and the basic landscaping of the world have a distinctly Warcraftian feel to them, and the quest names are rife with whimsical pop culture references.\n\nBut there are some real differences, too, and the first and most important is the combat. All the clunkiness of fighting in World of Warcraft—and most other MMOs, for that matter—is gone, replaced by an action-based system that controls like an FPS. You can't just select a nearby enemy and tell your character to attack; instead, you have to place your crosshairs over your foe and press an action button. In addition, each character comes with a simple defensive maneuver you can use to avoid damage—and, of course, as you progress through the game you'll unlock plenty of extra spells and moves.\n\nThe precise mechanisms of combat will depend on which class you choose at the game's outset. I've played with archer, gunner and sorcerer all of which are easy-to-use damage dealers who specialize in ranged combat. The other options are berserkers and slayers (melee damage dealers), lancers (tanks), mystics (support healers), priests (primary healers), reapers (high mobility/dps) and finally warriors (tanks and/or melee damage dealers). Your race matters too. Different races come with different bonuses, different back stories, and different looks. The Popori are a particularly striking bunch; they're animals that have been made magical.\n\nThe underlying story here is somewhat bizarre—it starts with two gods dreaming up different races of creatures. But the bottom line is that your world is emerging from a contentious past—many of the races here faced serious challenges, including slavery. But now, all seven groups must work together to face a new enemy. The Argons have emerged from the underworld, and hope to take over TERA—which stands for The Exiled Realm of Arborea.\n\nTERA also surpasses World of Warcraft in terms of graphics and sound—as it should, considering its higher system requirements. The visuals are a solid step up, with a bit more detail and clarity than WoW players will be used to. The sound effects and music are terrific, drawing the listener in to a fantasy world like few other games can.\n\nIf there's an area in which TERA falls short, it's that it can sometimes feel like more of a grind than WoW. I can't quite put my finger on the reason, but I think part of it is that TERA's quests are much heavier on basic errands—kill quests are a bit more entertaining than "run over there and talk to this other guy" quests, especially when the combat system is a huge selling point. Of course, another part of it just might be that the game will feel familiar to any WoW player. But whatever the reason, I occasionally got the feeling that I was just running back and forth between markers on the map, rather than engaging in an epic quest with fascinating combat. These spells never lasted for too long, but they did detract from the experience.\n\nOf course, TERA comes with a full suite of multiplayer features. You can team up with other players through a matching system, or by joining guilds for organized raids. Also there are PVP battleground areas and PvP realms, deathmatches that take place right in the normal game world, and duels.\n\nI almost hesitate to lavish so much praise on TERA. Given how much it has borrowed from World of Warcraft, TERA is standing on the shoulders of a very tall, very strong giant. But the bottom line is that TERA fixes the very worst aspect of WoW—the lame combat—while making some improvements to other features and doing a good job of emulating the basics. If you're looking for a good MMO, TERA is an excellent choice.","November 13, 2015","true","159.5"," 328 of 412 people (80%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","80","328","412","27","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thediabetic/recommended/323370/","thediabetic","Novolog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thediabetic/","96 products in account","I think after 200 hours, I have an opinion on this game.  The combat is fun and punchy, similar to the likes of Monster Hunter (for readers who are familiar with that series), as the player must move about the battlefield avoiding attacks and striking when necessary.  It really does make for some pretty wild action at times.  There are several different classes, however the "gunner" class is restricted to female high elves and castanics (dark elves, essentially) and the reaper class is only available to the "elin" race when another character on the player's profile is at level 40.  The classes all handle their roles quite well, and even the mystic and priest (support) classes are perfectly worthwhile to play as.  The mystic and priest aren't quite as fun to play as solo since they're limited for damage-dealing abilities, but they're a blast to play as in dungeons or when partied up with friends.\n\nThis game also has a crafting system, in which players can craft armor, weapons, combat buff charms, and potions.  The game doesn't do a very sound job of explaining this system however unless you talk to a few scattered NPC's around Velika (the hub town) and even then, they give you a very basic tutorial of the system.  The crafting system IS worthwhile, as some of the best endgame equipment can only be made through this system.\n\nThe quests are pretty basic, save for some level 61-65 quests at endgame that get a bit more interesting.  The story quests really aren't that bad, and they even have some pretty nice looking cutscenes for more key points in the story.  Sadly they're not very complex quests and don't ask much of the player, so if you go into this game expecting something along the likes of what an MMO such as "The Secret World" has to offer, you may be disappointed.\n\nAside from that, I find the "final" story quests of a particular region's questline to be particularly irritating.  The final quest is almost always a dungeon raid in which you need to gather up 4 other buddies and- of course- raid the dungeon.  These dungeons are incredibly difficult for a person to do alone on "normal mode," but often can be completed with the collaboration of a DPS class and a support class.  The story quests spill over into these raid dungeons and must be completed to finish up that particular region's storyline.  Forcing people to either convince their friends to try out an MMO or team up with randoms is incredibly annoying.  Especially since there is a "Solo mode" which tones down the dungeon so a single person can raid an albeit shorter version of the dungeon.  Why a person can't just complete the questline on "solo mode" is just annoying.  Aside from that, that's the worst thing I really have to say about quests in this game.\n\nThis game is also free-to-play, meaning it has a cash shop (obviously).  The only "pay to win" item in the store per-se is a scroll that will allow a person to reach level 60 instantly.  For a game like this, this item really is made for people who are already familiar with the game, as a newbie who uses this item will find themselves using a class that they have no idea how to use, which is key for mastering this game's combat.  Most of the other items in the cash shop are also tradeable ingame, including items like "name change vouchers" or keys for strongboxes.  Otherwise, this game puts an emphasis on cosmetics and making your character look cool.  Ultimately, the cash shop and the way it was implemented isn't something to lose sleep over and isn't an element that ruins the experience.\n\nFor those interested in how the cash shop works, if you have "elite status" (a subscription service), you get a discount for the credits you can buy for the store (I'm not sure how much of a discount).  Otherwise the prices aren't totally unreasonable, but some of the items in the cash shop can go close to around $50-$60 without the elite status.  There are also elite status "vouchers" that can be traded ingame, and 1-day vouchers can be earned at certain levels (I believe it's one per character).\n\nNow here's the tricky part- the community.  TERA has several different servers (3 PVE, 3 PVP), and moving a character between them costs a fair amount of money ($20 USD I believe).  So I'm not sure how the other servers fare for their communities, but I tend to stick to the "Celestial Hills - Roleplaying" server, since RP servers are often more laid back than others.  Most people you meet in open or crowded areas aren't generally so bad, but the global chat is like flossing with razor wire.  Sometimes it can be tolerable and laid back, but at other times it gets filled up with spam and people trying to offer "favors" for ingame cash, or just being lewd in general.  It sounds amusing at a glance, and it was amusing for maybe the first 10 minutes.  200 hours later and I have to say it's probably one of the most irritating things I've seen in an MMO.  Thankfully there's the option to just disable the global chat, so don't let it stop you from trying this game out!\n\nThe other issue with the community really isn't the community's fault.  Earlier in this review I stated how irritating it could be trying to get in a group of randoms to raid a dungeon - and the game has an interesting solution.  There's a "matchmaking" function that will set a player up in a party that's seeking to raid a region's dungeon.  Unfortunately, most parties are often well-off for DPS classes and not near as many people take the time to play as a support class such as the mystic or priest.  I honestly don't blame people for not wanting to make a party of 5 DPS'ers, but it's difficult to get into a party if you're not a support class.\n\nUltimately, this is a game worth playing.  It has fun combat, good dungeon raids (despite the aforementioned nitpicks), a competent challenge, and the graphics are pretty sweet.  I'd say give it a try- but turn that global chat off!","May 28, 2015","true","222.4"," 107 of 116 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","107","116","5","0"

It used to be available on Steam, then they took it off, now it is back on! Most of my play was while the game was not available on Steam, so please ignore the fact that Steam only says I have a few hours on the game. I have a lot, lot more!\n\nComing from an FPS background, Tera suits me down to the ground. It is a fantasy mmo with FPS controls. The scale of the game is enormous and the graphics are simply glorious. This is an ideal game for FPS players who would like to branch out in to fantasy mmo.\n\nThe depth and detail in the game is just staggering. It is one enormous open-world that you can freely wander about in, and it's absolutely breathtaking.\n\nThe highlight of the game tends to be the spectacular artwork and the combat system. Gameplay is actually pretty simple and repetative although the end-game dungeons are much more inventive than the main game itself. By the time you get to the end-game, you are pretty much bored to death of the rinse-repeat nature of the quests.\n\nThere is a comprehensive gathering and crafting system, even if there isn't much of an introduction to it. I think it is fair to say that most players ignore it until later on, but it is worthwhile using the system as soon as you can. You can make what is a great deal of money for a low level player gathering, crafting and selling items to high level players.\n\nThere is also a very large achievement system with some very exclusive rewards. Of course there are exclusive items that need real money, but it's nice that you can obtain some genuinely desirable items through dedicated play. There are some really nice items that can won in a matter of hours and of course tons that can be obtained with in-game gold on the traders.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some aspects of the game that you will either love or hate. The costumes and rides are simply amazing, albeit you must be prepared for outfits that are very much out-of-character and really do change the atmosphere of the game. Police, nurse, maid outfits and so on. You can even be a pink bunny and fight with a giant carrot if you want. Also the game is generally much more sexist than we are used to in the West. Particularly with the Elin character the game borders on the edge of unacceptable.\n\nOf course mmo's are really about the community and the community with Tera is generally good, albeit there are a lot of school kids playing the game because it's free.\n\nThere are a few downsides though. The first is that it has a very limited end-game. Once you have completed the main game, then there are a half dozen or so dungeons and fifteen or so dailies and that's it. It quickly becomes incredibly repetitive. So try to enjoy the game as much as you can while levelling, because once you are there you might give up pretty soon after.\n\nThe second problem is for players in the EU. The EU version of the game is managed by Gameforge and they have completely wrecked the in-game economy. They have effectively made it Pay-To-Play, sapping every ounce of enjoyment out of the game unless you are a serious spend-a-holic. For that very reason the servers are much emptier than they were just a few short months ago, and everyone has been moving to Tera NA  ( North America ) where the game is managed so, so much better.\n\nRecommended?  Well, and here comes the surprising part -  the Steam version IS the American run version. So, no matter where you are, you get the very best the game has to offer. People outside the US can expect a larger ping, but don't worry, it's fine for most countries. So..YES...try it. There are issues, but the wonderful graphics and exciting game-play are a must try.","May 11, 2015","true","527.2"," 117 of 136 people (86%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","86","117","136","8","8"

I absolutely love how much we can customize our characters in the main screen.  The crafting and gathering aspect of the game are probably one of my favorite - It isn't something you need to farm for hours (At least at the lower levels, currently at 300 for most of my proffesions).  Beautiful scenery, great story line.  I also REALLY enjoy the fighting style, in WoW we select our target (And  can scroll through via the tab button) but here it's all point and shoot at the enemy which is a GREAT break from what I'm used too.\n\nThe only downfall is it does have a cash shop and I tend to get sucked into buying fashion items for my toons ;).  Elite status is amazing for this game - you can teleport to any city basically, which is really nice. BANK space in this game though is a huge issue, but they have items in the cash shop that you can buy to help with that.  I believe you can also spend in-game currency for items as well.\n\nOver all I Love this game :)","June 16, 2015","true","186.5"," 81 of 88 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","81","88","5","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Weebaloo/recommended/323370/","Weebaloo","Weebaloo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Weebaloo/","183 products in account","Playing TERA solo vs. with friends:\nTERA is extremely boring alone. If you want to play this game make sure you play it with friends. Not only will it make the game less difficult if you are playing a class that isn't good solo, but it will help kill the monotony of the questing/dungeons pre-end game. If you don't have friends, simply join a guild and quest with guildees. If you are tackling the game solo however here are some tips and warnings:\n1. Make sure you are completeing quests in the right order, or else you will have to backtrack to the beginning of the zone to complete main quests you didn't realize you weren't completeing (it is easier to mess up than it sounds).\n2. If you are playing solo make sure you pick a class that is good solo. A lot of classes in this game are balanced very strongly in a tank/dps/healing set-up and a lot of the big mobs in level 30+ zones get incredibly stronger than they were in previous zones. I recommend the brawler class as a great starting class. I played brawler and didn't have any issues with questing (or running dungeons) solo until around level 50+ when the level of the content was catching up with how far ahead my character was.\n\nZone Questing 1/10:\nEvery single zone in the game has the exact same leveling experience. 3 differen't locations per zone where you get quest type A. (kill 10 mobs quest), quest type B. (collect 10 items quest), and quest type C. (kill 5 big strong mob quest) once you complete those quests you move on to the next hub. After all 3 hubs in each sub-zone of a region you will get a quest chain to go through a solo-dungeon and repeat the whole thing and then eventually you will finally move on to the next leveled region and start all over again. I was hoping at least the expansion from 60-65 would have changed the questing experience a little, but honestly it was exactly the same. This game has by far the most undesireable questing experience I have ever participated in. I have played WoW, FFXIV, EverQuest, ArcheAge, Black Desert Online, Blade and Soul, Aion, Rift and many other MMOs, but this one takes the cake for the most boring grindy questing of them all. Luckily there are other options to choose from while questing.\n\nEnd-game Questing N/A score:\nThis game really has none of it.\n\nDungeons 2/10:\nDuneons in TERA are fun at first (literally the first dungeon), but you will soon realize like the questing that they are all exactly the same. A lot of them use the same assets so enemies and layout look exactly the same as the dungeon you just did, but with a differen't coat of paint. Essentially kill 3 rooms of mobs, fight a boss, next three rooms, another boss, ect. If you are using dungeons to get to 65 (that is what I would recommend) then prepare to take a lot of breaks, or put on some music while you do them. I didn't give dungeons a 1/10 simply because some of the bosses actually look pretty damn badass, and the gear you can get in dungeons is pretty awesome. However, dungeon bosses still all lack creative mechanics most you can just tank and spank, as well as any real exciting reason as to why you should want to kill them (until the expansion). Once you hit upper 50 dungeons and the expansion dungeons nothing really changes, but they get more exciting lore wise and you will actually feel like you have a purpose for running them to get geared for raids.\n\nRaids (cannot give honest score):\nNot a long section. I didn't play much of the raids, but they meet your typical mmorpg "get geared in dungeons then increase in raid tier" format. From what I played of them they are pretty fun and challenging, but I had a hard time keeping aggro so I didn't play much of them after getting the first raid tier gear.\n\nLore 3/10-->7/10 and Classes/Races/Combat 9/10:\nI don't really have anything to say about the lore for pre-Arun expac, other than it is pretty boring and lacking (imo), but Fate of Arun's story can get pretty exciting esspecially anything centered around the character Zolyn and her friends since they are the only redeeming lore characters in the whole game. As for classes warrior is a pain in the butt I don't recommend playing it if you are new to the game, but most of the classes that I tried seemed fun you purchase skills with money from trainers. Brawler was a blast for me to play and probably in my top 5 favorite classes of mmorpg history. The combat in TERA started the action style combat breaking away from games like WoW so in that regard the combat is fluid and great for the most part. Keeping aggro as a tank seemed to be difficult for me as the only thing, dps pull insanely high in this game, but that could be just because I suck at tanking (most likely). All in all this game is literally known for it's combat and is why it has so many players.\n\nWorld PvP N/A score vs. Battlegrounds 8/10:\nI didn't participate in end-game world pvp so I cannot say how fun it is although it seemed pretty fun like most game with world pvp. Prepare to get ganked A LOT when you are leveling though. And yes, this game has pvp AND pve servers so if you have a preference between the two you will be covered either way. Battlegrounds are fun and unique.... for what there is. I gave the battlegrounds a good score in this game, but honestly there are a very low amount of them which can cause boredom to some players very quickly. If you want a more elaborate discussion on TERA's pvp feel free to message me. Also if you want to know about class balance I am the wrong person to ask as I only leveled to 65 with brawler and it was pretty OP at the time (they may have nerfed it by now).\n\nCommunity 10/10 (biased I know):\nFirst off this game has a very friendly community you will mostly only encounter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in pvp related activities (like when you get that one guy in battlegrounds who thinks he is better than everybody else and he is carrying the team). Secondly, my opinion is a little biased because this game has a huge anime crowd which I do not mind (warning to those of you who do not like anime you are going to be seeing fans of it pretty much around every corner). It only gets a little cringy around people who are huge Elin fanboys I recommend staying away from them anyway (no offense, but look at what you are playing a little more closely and realize why others might want to stay away from you).\n\nCrafting N/A score:\nIt is your standard MMO crafting much like WoW's so I can't really throw an opinion on this one as it is a hit or miss for most. A lot of players don't care about the crafting at all.\n\nVisuals/Graphics 9/10:\nGame looks great and the artsyle is very pretty. Some zones have amazing screenshot-picture-perfect areas. Some of the best looking zones I have seen in an MMO (too bad the questing ruins it).\n\nQ. Is the game P2W? ("Pay to win" meaning, do you have to pay for in-game shop items with real money to not fall behind other players)\nA. No, this game has the best F2P model I have ever seen. All of the in-game shop items are cosmetics to make your characters look cool. The game has a subscription you can pay, but honestly I found it pretty much worhtless. It doesn't give you anything you cannot get for free except a teleport book so you don't have to take flight paths.\n\nSummary (tl:dr):\nTERA has a lot going for it in the free to play market and can provide many hours of fullfilling mmo experience. The questing is beyond dull and more than half of the dungeons in the game have been cut out. Dungeons in general are uninteresting and bland until level 55+. Story isn't that great until Fate of Arun at 60, but the combat and visuals of the game are top notch and fun. PvP is lacking in content, but still fun nonetheless. Great game to try for free, but you might get bored fast. I recommend Black Desert Online Instead.","May 17","false","94.9"," 143 of 184 people (78%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","78","143","184","14","12"

I've tried ESO, Aion, Rift, Runescape, WoW, Guild Wars, Blade and Soul, ect. But the one I keep coming back to is TERA. There's just something abut this game that the combat and story and world all comes together in somethng just right. So for those of you on the fence about this game here's how it goes:\n-The story is about as interesting as you can get in an MMO storyline, exactly how you want it. Mindless enough that you can grind for hours and not forget really where you are storyline wise.\n-The community is the friendliest I've ever seen (Keep in mind I really only play PvE) and we are all so helpful to each other. When questions are asked in world chat by new players they get legitemate help from everyone.\n-Dungeon runs are fun! The combat makes them fast paced and intense, I've ran through with full groups fairly easily or put up a real challenge and had only 2 of us go through a 5 man dungeon.\n-Weapons are class-bound, the weapon style you start with is what you get the whole game. Don't think of this as a negative though, when you're the priest in the party and that legendary staff drops then it's all yours.\n-Now the real bread and butter: the combat. The True-action combat is what makes this game. Sure games like Blade and Soul and ESO could be a little faster but the combat in TERA stays true to what it promises. If you miss your dodge or block, you will be punished for it. If you dodge roll into a powerful counter attack, it will do serious damage. Skill combo(ing) is up to you as a player and you'll discover certain skills flow better with others as far as animation timing goes. The combat is also freaking fun. You aren't simply trading blows with goblins for a few min then moving on, you're engaged and avoiding attacks and timing your own.\n\nTo sum it up: This game is free and I've sunk in almost 600 hours into it. There's a reason for that. The game is fun, fast-paced, and has a lot of replay value with so many classes. It's continued to keep my personal interest as developers are constantly working to update the game for us. I highly recommend it.","April 28","true","583.6"," 62 of 71 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","62","71","2","2"

(even with hardware vysnc on or on adaptive)\n-mini-map is kinda laggy and takes some getting used to\n-when on a mount sometimes changing direction while moving the camera causes a slight blip in which way the character is facing, just not 100% super fluid animations on everything.\n-it's not pay to win but i want them to take my money.\n-the game crashes and resets my evga precision x settings, sometimes just a blip and i can keep playing, sometimes it freezes all the way and i need to force close it, restart the client, and steam. happens maybe every 4-5 hours of gameplay. makes me take a break lelelel\n-sometimes i autoloot, sometimes i don't, sometimes my companion auto attacks, sometimes he doesn't.\n\n\nnothing game killing and on the PLUS side, there are great features that are really drawing me in.\n-mat farming can be done with multiple people at a time, speeds it up, AND gives you more than doing it alone\n-mat farming gives you awesome buffs\n-enchanting doesn't destroy your items! only the mats used to enchant! THANK GOD!!!!\n- you have to be about 10 levels over the recommended level of the area to start getting less gold and exp.\n-i'm playing as a mystic, and i feel really really self sufficient. i'm a support class that's very balanced and do not feel tied down by pots.\n-the diversity of enemies is immense. it's really refreshing.\n-the trade market is really well done.\n\nand it's because of those pluses that i will be playing for a long time, and after these boosts wear off from this initial release, will definitely support the developer.\n\n11/10 would play a non-gameforge game again. sorry that eu users have to put up with them. enmasse seems pretty legit.\n\nupdated 5/7/15 after 25 hours logged (added the type of controller i use, and did a slight reformat stating my complaints first and the pluses second)","May 5, 2015","true","156.1"," 84 of 106 people (79%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","79","84","106","17","20"

Do I recommend the soul-sucking monster of an MMO that has, effectively, ruined my life?  Yes, I do.  I started playing Tera over a year ago- January of last year, actually; I just checked- and while I've had brief breaks during that time, I've still been playing through the majority of the time that I've had the game downloaded.\n\nFor the first several months, I was absolutely a casual player, slowly leveling up my main.  (Who was, at the time, a warrior-class Castanic; now I main an Elin reaper, though as of the gunner's release, I'm liking it an awful lot.  Oh lord.  But I digress.)  I really didn't know much about my class at all, and looking back, there're some things that I really wish I'd known.\n\nEventually, however, after shuffling servers for a bit (before returning to my main server- VoT), I hit level 60, which was the level cap at the time.  It was pretty damnably satisfying, I have to admit.  Then I decided to work on my reaper, and I think that's about when I changed from very casual, to playing the game a hell of a lot more than I had been before, almost exclusively on my reaper.\n\nThe gameplay is addictive- while the initial grind to the level can get tedious, it's most definitely doable within a few weeks, if you're playing fairly casually, and within a few days if you're really working on it.  For example, I made my gunner earlier today, and so far I've gotten her to level 31; the class came out around 24 hours ago, as of writing this review, and I know that people have already gotten their gunners to 65.  Of course, they were racing in order to get an achievement, but still, the point stands- it's possible to go a long way, solo, in a fairly short span of time.\n\nBut once you hit the level cap, that's really where most of the harder PvE content begins, and honestly, where you really start to learn your class.  Not that you learn nothing before then, but you definitely learn quicker what you should and shouldn't do when you're getting oneshotted repeatedly, due to using a dodge skill before it was really necessary.\n\nThis is something I've learned the hard way, unfortunately.\n\nAdmittedly, there is a definite tendency for the same enemies to be re-colored, and used over again, without really changing the mechanics of the fight at all.  But at the same time, it's important to note that there's no tab-targeting in this game, and- as far as I'm aware- there aren't a whole lot of lock-on skills either.\n\nFor a comparison of how the controls work (at least for moving your character- the skills are another story entirely), think Skyrim.  You have the WASD pad, and a free-moving third person camera, and a menu that pulls up when you hit ESC.  (Or rather, it was where you hit ESC and it pulled up.  Now you have to go into the UI Options in order to set it to do so, which I'd honestly recommend, because otherwise the screen looks cluttered, and it's not like you can click on it without hitting ESC anyway, since the mouse controls the camera.)\n\nThen the skills are on a fairly standard scheme, where you have one row of skills as the number keys just above the keyboard, and another row as the F keys above that.  This can also be changed, and easily.  Just find keybinds that work for you, and work out which skill you want to put on which key as you go, since you get more skills as you level.\n\nAnyway, I'm rambling.\n\n\n\nGraphics:\n4/5 - They're gorgeous, but I have to deck a star due to the fact that, generally speaking, you have to turn the video settings down in order to not have a whole lot of graphical lag.  And even then, you might still get an only half-decent framerate.\n\nCharacter creation/customization:\n4/5 - Again, there're some seriously gorgeous characters that you can make with this game.  But then, you can also make some of the most horrifying, hideous, eye-searing, Lovecraft-worthy abominations you can imagine.  Just try hitting the randomize button.  Trust me.  Then, some of the facial types/adornments tend to look better than others, though fiddling with the sliders tends to work wonders on almost any of them.  (Almost.  There are some that not even I can save.)\n\nAnd the costumes.\n\nOh my god, the costumes.  Since the initial publishers tend to make most of their revenue off of costumes for Elins, along with female Castanics/Elves, the costumes tend to be more focused around them.  And generally, I have no complaints, since those are also what I tend to play as.  One of the most recent batches of costumes is absolutely glorious, except for a pretty glaring bug on some of the dresses.  Ahem.  They really should've caught that.  But anyway, if you're going to be playing as a race other than a female Elin/Castanic/Elf, and costumes are something vital to your experience, just note that your choices are going to be more limited.\n\n(On the bright side, however, you can also get dyeable costume versions of basically all any and all of the armor in the game- with things called fashion coupons- for any race/gender/class out there.)\n\nGameplay:\n5/5 - Like I mentioned, the initial leveling process can be a bit tedious, but I'm still giving gameplay- in general- five stars, due to the fact that the combat in general is the best I've come across, in any MMO.  PvP is extremely fun, as are the hard-mode dungeons, and that's not even mentioning open-world PvP on three of the servers, and the battlegrounds, which are, in essence, two teams of players pitted against each other.  In Corsairs' Stronghold, for example, you have two raids of twenty people each, trying to beat each other.\n\n(The goal is either to defend a crystal/break the crystal, with one team on offense and the other on defense, for the first round, and then the roles are reversed- the team that was defending the crystal has to do slightly more damage than the other team managed in the last round, within the same amount of time, or less, and the other team has to attempt to keep them from getting that much damage, until the time of the match runs out.  It's ridiculously fun, but I'd definitely recommend looking up guides on Corsairs' Stronghold before you actually try it, so that you're not running around like a headless chicken, with no idea what you're doing, or where you're going.  Corsairs' Stronghold is unlocked at level 30, by the way, with the rest of the battlegrounds unlocking at 65, I think?)\n\nSo, yeah.  The PvP is phenomenal.  Just note that if you decide to play on a PvP server, it's best if you switch off of the main channel while you're leveling, and until you have at least decent gear.  (Oh, and if you're planning on doing PvP, save the boxes you get.  The next cycle of highest-tier gear will require materials that come from the boxes, so it would be a good idea to save them from the start, if you can stand it.)\n\nAtmosphere:\n4/5 - While some of the costumes can be immersion-breaking, if that's something you're concerned about, I honestly think that the atmosphere of most of the areas in the game more than make up for it.  If you get a chance, check out the location called Scythera Fae.  Just be careful not to go too far outside of the town, seeing as it's a high-level area.\n\nCommunity:\n?/5 - It really depends, honestly.  There're nice people, fantastic people, really ridiculously rude people, and straight-up asshats- along with everyone in between- just like anywhere else.  Really, though, I haven't had a bad experience with the other players at all, which is pretty nice.  (It helps that En Masse has excellent support, and that the block system is easily implemented if there's someone that's really grating on your nerves.)\n\nOverall:\n5/5 - After the time I've spent playing this game, I think it would be dishonest to give it anything less.  Even if it has its flaws, it's fun and graphically gorgeous, with the best combat and PvP that I've seen to date.","May 6, 2015","true","356.6"," 53 of 60 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","53","60","4","0"

I wasn't too impressed with the tutorial line of missions at the beginning and was considering putting it down after going some ways past the tutorial along the story line where up until that point it had just been nothing but killing ♥♥♥♥ easy enemies and playing errand boy when a member of the guild I joined told me to just ditch the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ quest and start making my way to some place called Devian Silva. So I did and what do you know, the game actually started getting fun.\n\nThe game really shines when you're fighting enemies a couple levels above you. I thought the stuff in the description about "true action combat" was a load of crap but when you're fighting tougher enemies mashing attack no longer becomes the most viable strategy. I had rolled a lancer and found myself actually blocking, dodging, and being fairly methodical when it came to chaining abilities and combos together, especially when it came dealing with enemies around 3-4 levels higher than me. Hell, it actually gave me some dark souls vibes and I found myself having genuine fun. Incidentally I was gaining much more XP this way than just picking some flowers for some random NPC.\n\nIt's an MMO that rewards you for pushing your character as far as you can (although there is a limit. Tried taking on some much higher level enemies outside the main city and I couldn't even damage them. They ended up killing me in one hit) with fun and challenging combat and punishes you for trying to take safer routes (i.e. taking on enemies lower or equal to you or just running through a bunch of fetch quests to level up) for character progression with boredom and tedium.\n\nAside from the frequent spouting of ♥♥♥♥♥ memes, "lel", and talking about waifus, the community doesn't seem half bad either. The people in my guild seem pretty chill and I've sat around campfires in towns with random groups of strangers and just shot the ♥♥♥♥ and cracked jokes. It's nice to see a F2P MMO where people use chat for more than just spamming trade offers.\n\nI'd definitely recommend it.","May 29, 2015","true","14.7"," 51 of 57 people (89%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","89","51","57","10","0"

Especially in quests. If you ask me if it's one of the best MMOs out there, it is, for most people. But, not for me.

Starting character customization is somewhat lacking with limited hair color and eye color options but there is a modest selection of hairstyles and facial complexions. The real customization comes in costumes and armour selection. There's multiple slots for costumes allowing for mixing and matching of different costume sets. No two players are the same as everyone tends to find their own personal way of mixing costumes.\n\nMost MMOs I've played tend to pan handle you in terms of where you can go. In Tera, my personal favourite is climbing the mountains that are littered across the landscape. Took me a while to realise but I was enlightened to discover I could go on top of mountains in an area that otherwise looked inaccessible. However, with freedom of discovery comes glitches. Avoid waterfalls as my character got stuck inside one behind all the rocks.\n\nLevel balancing seems a little funky, NPCs two levels above are god-like and difficult to take down. NPCs two levels below are weaksauce to the point of boredom. However, levels matching you are well balanced so there's that. But I'm finishing story quests so fast that I reach NPCs several levels above me... I welcome the challenge, however. I don't PVP much, I'm more of a PVE-hero player. But I do have limited experience with PVP in this game and I have to say that it's fun and I'll go that far. The guilds are oddly setup, it requires player discretion but that's something you can easily get used to. People are vastly organised in guild/alliance battles and I appreciate that.\n\nFarming is immensely easy. My only gripe is NPCs respawn too quickly. I can cartwheel a small group of NPCs indefinitely or repeatedly take down a mini-boss. World bosses are exceptionally rare and that's something I appreciate more.\n\nServer populations are still very high, 2 servers are dead but that's expected of a game many years old. I'm on Ascension Valley and valkyries are (as of this review) still flying to-and-from Velika like popcorn out of a pot.\n\nAnd to all those people that say Priests can't solo anything: I've solo'd dungeons, mini-bosses, groups of mini-bosses, and BAMs with a Priest. Git gud or go home kiddies.\n\nFinally, I'm a big fan of the anime-style special effects. 7/10","October 27, 2015","true","580.0"," 41 of 48 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","41","48","5","4"

I started this game wanting to rip someone's throat out because I kept getting Errors (which actually happen because of AVG). I didn't know this at the time and about rage quit. Boy am I glad I stayed steady and found a fix. I have to say, I've never been a big MMORPG fan but this changes everything. It's like my favorite parts of other games combined into an MMO experience.\n\nSome analysis on certain aspects of the game:\n- Combat and classes are essentially Monster Hunter 3\n-World is absolutely amazing, combine some of the best fantasy environments you've seen and it's this game. From floating magical islands to thorny dark twisted caverns. This game's got it all.\n- RPG is something lacking. I find myself walking up to the quest icon, spamming F and walking away. Maybe I should look into the lore....\n- Boob physics\n- Healthy range of races from hulking rock-people to what I assume to be lolis\n- Interesting alchemy, enchanting, and crafting mechanics. Nothing new, but interesting.\n\nDo recommend if you're looking to scratch that fantasy itch.\n\nEdit: After reaching level 40 and 36 in-game hours the only thing I will edit about this is about the combat. Early game combat is, indeed, a simplified MH3 system. However, after about, say, level 25, things get much more complex. You gain abilities as you level up which you can chain together to crush enemies with unprejudice violence. Co-op also becomes a vital role to acquiring rare items and beating raid crucibles. It's very fun, but you better pray to the Maker that you have a healer with half a cup of sense.\n\nAnother thing I might mention is that the developers are still very active in the community. It's nice to see updates every holiday and essentially twice a month. That's more than I can say for other games *looks at The Forest*","May 10, 2015","true","68.3"," 38 of 47 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","38","47","6","0"

It adds another layer of skill and depth onto the mechanics that already exist in most modern MMORPGs. Other than the combat however, TERA doesn't do all that much to make itself standout from other MMORPGs, but it really doesn't need to, because for what it is and what it tries to accomplish, it does things very well.\n\nAnother point I'd like to bring up is the business model of this game. It originally required a $15 a month subscription-fee, however as you can probably imagine, that was quickly abandoned for a free-to-play model. Many free-to-play games in this day and age, particularly MMOs, are often either straight up pay-to-win, or they will artificially slow you down so much that you need to pay to have a good experience. TERA thankfully does not fall under these categories. Rather, TERA only really allows you to pay for fair things like costumes, accessories, weapon skins, mounts, and some consumables and convenience features like XP boosters and travel journals. It also has an optional "Elite" subscription service that gives you some nice perks such as a unique mount, a bunch of convenience features, store discounts, among other things which can be found listed on their website. So I will conclude this point by saying that I don't think I have played a free-to-play MMO with a more fair business model than TERA.\n\nOverall TERA is an excellent MMO and has been sucking away my time ever since it found it's way onto Steam, I don't think I've been so enthralled in a game like this since the old days of WoW. It's free, if you're at all interested I would highly recommend giving it a shot, I doubt you will regret it.","May 21, 2015","true","277.3"," 37 of 47 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","37","47","2","0"

Almost all of them are from people who have done 0 research of the steam release (Those complaining that its not for the EU servers) Or people who dont know how to play the game properly (People who complain the are is too full. YOU CAN CHANGE CHANNELS TO AVOID IT)\n\nTERA is one of the best ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes out IMO. There is 0 pay to win, The support from EME is top notch and must I even mention the combat style? Its free and they are gifting all these items that I had to work for when I was first climbing through the levels. They even dropped a new leveling dungeon in there for the new gunners and steam players. Not to mention the that you all got free mounts. That crap is normally expensive.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vinceblood/recommended/323370/","vinceblood","VinceBlood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vinceblood/","116 products in account","Before you read further into why I can't play this game, I want to discuss its good points:\n\n-Visually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gorgeous.  TERA's art is phenomenal.\n-Incredibly fluid and rewarding combat system.  It's like an actual fighting game, and ranged characters can really take advantage of the real-time aiming.  Archers are a blast.\n-Fantastic character customization.  The creation system leads to beautiful characters every time, suited to their roles and races.\n-Blocking that isn't hindered by a pre-set value.  If you're a Berserker or a Lancer you can block for days and you'll just soak the damage.\n-Lancers are by far the coolest tanking class I've ever seen.  I want more games to operate their tanks like TERA does Lancers.\n\nNow here's why I can't play TERA:\n\n-It's too, too Korean for my tastes.  It's so anime Toonami would probably stream it after dark.  It's sylized in such a way that everything is sexualized -- and I won't fault them on this because the men are just as sexualized as the women.  However that's not why I play my games.  When I roll up a tanky female character I want a modicum of protection, not a plate bikini and boobs that move when standing still.\n\n-The grind happens almost immediately after you exit the "basic" zone and go to Lumbertown.  The game is ingenious in this way; it throws the first 12-14 levels at you like it's no big deal, and the moment you begin to do the REAL content the game slows down immediately.  You start getting repeatable grind quests the moment you meet the first settlement beyond the city, and the XP comes much, much slower.  It does its best to hook you and yanks the reins the moment it does.\n\n-Certain classes just do NOT solo.  Priest, Lancer, Mystic -- the 'support' roles do not have viable solo setups or skills.  I spent hours looking at builds for my Lancer that could get me through leveling, and all the highest rated/most recent guides say "Run every dungeon with a party until you level up enough to move to the next dungeon."  After getting spoiled by Guild Wars, City of Heroes, Wildstar and Guild Wars 2, it's my firm belief that every class should be able to spec for soloing OR party play at their leisure.  The DPS roles excel at the game, and my Archer hit level 14 within 2 hours, whereas my Lancer hit 14 in about 7.  Yes, I timed it.  It doesn't feel good, man!\n\n-The coolest, strongest classes are gender/race locked.  Yes, you read that right.  If you want to play a super-versatile Reaper, which has tons of AoE and can mow through enemies, you have to roll an Elin.  If you want to play a Gunner (which looks ripped right out of Torchlight II), with MASSIVE cannons and summoned robots/drones, you have to roll a female Castanic or High Elf. Every other class is available to every race, except for Gunner and Reaper, and they're by far the strongest and most versatile classes available.  It's a damn shame.\n\n-The Elin.  Oh, good lord, the Elin.  The Elin are tiny little girls with huge thighs and baby-faces, and they're incredibly sexualized by the game.  Even playing alongside one I was uncomfortable.  Let me put it this way:  I would not want to play as/near an Elin character in public.  You'd get some seriously strange looks with a scantily-clad little girl in bunny ears bouncing around your screen.  No thanks.\n\nIf you're okay with super-anime styling, heavy grind, and reliance on parties if you're not a DPS role -- go for it, man.  TERA has its potential for a lot of the folks I know, but it's not for me.  If you're looking to blow off steam and solo in an MMO, this isn't for you.  If you want a group experience and team reliance, give it a shot.  Just be warned:  You can't be ugly in this game.  Even the little girls are sexualized.","July 4, 2015","false","14.0"," 518 of 881 people (59%) found this review helpful 136 people found this review funny","59","518","881","136","80"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frozenstarro/recommended/323370/","frozenstarro","FrozenStarRo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frozenstarro/","221 products in account","I've been a player of TERA since the early summer of 2014, prior to the release of the Wounded World patch, which introduced the T15 gear and a batch of 4 new dungeons. Since then the world of TERA has only grown larger, with the release of a new continent, the increased cap level from 60 to 65, more dungeons, more battlegrounds and skycastles (guild halls), and the recent release of a new class. And let's not forget the numerous bi-monthly events or season festivals that happen all year long, in-between major patches!\n\nTERA is with certainty one of the liveliest free MMOs out there, with a developer team constantly working on bringing something new to the table.\n\nMajor draws:\n+ dynamic combat, with a wide array of skills, complete with glyphs to improve upon them, and the ability to chain attacks\n+ vast, beautiful and detailed world. From fairy forests, to deserted ruins to alien corrupted lands, TERA has it all, and a decent lore to tie it all together\n+ several races to choose from, players can choose to be a human hero or a fearsome amani, a luscious castanic or perhaps an asian loli elin\n+ 10 classes to choose from, though as a -, 2 of the classes are race and gender-locked\n+ dungeons and raids are awesome fun\n\nMajor flaws:\n- holy trinity. Though they recently improved upon it by allowing dungeon queues without tanks, it suffers from a great imbalance of classes, having only 2 healer classes, 1 tank, 5 pure dps classes and a hybrid tank/dps class\n- dungeon queue times, which is tied to the aforementioned issue. a dps can take even over 2h in queue before finding a group (happened today even) while queues for a tank/healer take less than 5 min\n- rather big gear treadmill, only made worse by a community heavily focused on ilevel (gearcheck rating), which usually leaves most racing for the top gear the second a new one is released or getting left behind with slim to none chances of finding parties to gear up at a later time\n- enchanting system that is a huge gold sink, with a big chance to fail at higher levels. Luckily it doesn't revert any progress made up to that point.\n- boring, repetitive sidequests. It's either kill 10 of this mob, 8 of that, fetch 5 flowers type of quests only\n- rather rudimentary character customization, no mix&match, just full costumes, but it does offer a pretty big selection of free in-game skins via the Fashion Coupons shop\n\nThe game also has an optional subscription, which is in no way mandatory to fully enjoy the game. It does offer some time-saving solutions, like an xp boost that with help level characters twice as fast or being able to list twice as many items on the trading post and a world atlas that allows you to teleport to cities and towns instead of embarking on a pegasus flight, but it doesn't hold too much value otherwise. It's an ideal not pay-to-win model, complete with a system that allows in-game trades of store-purchased goods for gold between players.\n","May 9, 2015","true","71.3"," 32 of 44 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","32","44","2","0"

The combat is fun, especially when fighting the larger boss types. Plus, the game is rather pretty.

Collect or Kill that.\n\nThat's pretty much it. There just isn't enough variety to make the storyline deep and engaging, and make the player feel they are impacting anything besides their wallet and experience bar. There were plenty of opportunities to place some interactive environmental mechanics that didn't involve simply waiting on a timer to expire and killing the magically appearing monsters. However, they were wasted.\n\nTera's shallow depths do not take long to explore, and that's a shame.\n\n\n\n\n\n","July 15, 2015","false","57.9"," 78 of 126 people (62%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","62","78","126","6","7"

And the thrill of iframing attacks. Tera is (though should more say "was") a very skill based game so it was very gratifying to see yourself not just get new gear and clear content but become a very skilled player which allowed you to do even more.\n\nOnce you really learned your class and the game well you were in a new "club" at that point, duo'ing or solo'ing dungeons, running things without a healer or tank. The player skill ceiling really opened up new ways to have fun and play the game.\n\nBack to my history a bit; since this was my first mmo I really took my time with it and soaked up the experience. Given back then the game was much harder and it took longer to level. It was a game that was best played with other people (which seems to be a foreign concept in mmo's these days) Good gear only came from the dungeons, back then you would only be able to +6 it unless you had a capped main that could feed your alts. The big world monsters that many quests needed were a good 4 times harder than they are now. And needed a party to take down unless you were a badass.\n\nAnd years ago before ftp the community was really great, it was that perfect size where there were plenty of people around and I had no problem finding friends to level with, but it wasnt overcrowded to the point that the chat window buzzed by too fast or that you were "just another face in the crowd" It was nice to see familiar names every day and pass people by in the world that you knew.\n\nI didnt level cap my sorcerer till just before the Argon Queen patch, with my Mystic right behind her (let me just say you dont know pain till you have levelled a mystic pre-thrall patch)\nFor many who have played the game, you know this was the golden era for Tera.\nEndgame at this point was perfect. In every way.\nLike the rest of the scrubs that just capped I got myself a rep vendor disc for my weapon, I purchased some abyss armor with the money I had saved and I started to bang my head against the 60 dungeons. I remember barely being able to solo a boss in TOT as I was getting badges for my glyphs, I remember getting into an sjg group and being completely dumbfounded as to what was going on.\nAfter getting my gear half decent and glyphs and what not I started Argon Corpus runs, and eventually edged my way into hard mode.\n\nThis was the turning point for me. No game would get my blood rushing quite the same. Knowing that if I miss one iframe, messup one placement. If I didnt save my cd's to burn the worms it was death around every corner. It required teamwork, and communication and personal skill it was amazing. I kept practicing and and was running achm regularly along with sjg and cof which I learned better.\n\nI felt pretty on top of the world.\n\nThen I went to Manayas Core.\nOh my god what a humbling experience. It took me months to try to get into training groups and to get myself skilled enough to run it. It wasnt actually till the WH patch that I got my first hardmode clear. MC had gone through some minor nerfs by then but was still a thrilling run and I have not felt so accomplished in a game before.\n\nThrough some connections and my dungeon clears I got into a WH static day one and through the many runs there and the connections I made with the other members I really boosted into a true endgame player. I had reached a point of mastery with my classes, I went through and cleared content I couldnt get into before, knxx, mchm, cof mkIII.\n\nBut the wh patch really just gave me the opportunity (friends, and money through drops I got a vision doc before everyone realized the quest was shareable and a mob the next day) to appreciate the older content more.\n\nAfter 60 runs of WH and not seeing a single robe drop for my sorc I decided to just make VM1 instead. Which made the wh gear seem soo boring with the lack of stats and customability. I ended up putting my mystic in a mix of regent and vm1, got my warrior in mayhem swords which I liked much better than the NF ones I made.\n\nEndgame was still good though. In that they havent removed much by this point.\n\nThe ftp switch was showing its signs though. The community was overrun with....lets just say ftp players arent typically the highest quality.\nThe new dungeons were easy by comparison. and as such all the gear was bop, with some very rare boe drops. So it was a bit hard to make money just running dungeons, it was more efficient to do the more mundane farming type runs (cw and sf) I still was making decent money on sjg talents though and was selling quills on the side.\n\nThen they removed the template system. Which I suppose we all saw coming with the ftp switch, to make matters worse the new gear was but ugly. No really, nobody liked it. We went from gorgeous abyss and regent templates to...purple rubber and green rubber. It was clear they wanted to sell more costumes, and ultimately thats what the game became. But it was at the loss of personality and individuality. I had my sorcerer decked out with remodels from all different templates, I was unique and it looked great. But now everyone was running around with the same costumes.\n\nTera never regained its endgame, the content has been easy, and limited. Everything was streamlined and easy to get so really there was only 2 dungeons to run. Crafting took a frontstage, so if you like botting nodes and mundane farming have fun I guess. Ways to make money were drowning quick, you either farmed ♥♥♥♥ all day or you gambled with loot boxes. Typical ftp stuff.\n\nBathysmal Rise patch was decent. At least better than the last, maybe just because I was running it with my priest in full vm1 gear so I was pretty squishy and it was extra thrilling because of that.\n\nI didnt like the stat changes either, everyone runs crit these days. And as an oldschool white damage sorc that just bugs me. Gear had been the same since wh, same boring 3 rerollable stats. We had some set bonuses now though which I really dont like because it restricts you from wearing what you want. I was content with keeping my NF gear for my warrior but kinda shooting myself in the foot with set bonuses for that.\n\n\nSo all in all, I still log in from time to time. But Im really just running on nostalgia. Most everyone I knew has left and moved on. The community has gotten pretty dead and asocial . Somehow goldsellers are in chat which I havent seen a single one till maybe 6months or so ago.\n\nThe saddest part is there just isnt another mmo on the market with the same edge of your seat gameplay. Tab games are way too rooted and stat reliant. I tried FFXIV up till a couple levels from cap, I was playing white mage and I just couldnt bring myself to do it. The grind was unreal and so boring. Dungeon runs were basically just spamming heal on the tank.\n\nEven looking on the release horizon Im not sure we will get another game like tera any time soon.\n\n\nIts probably still worth checking out if you are a new player, although I guess this review really just turned into me waxing nostalgic and isnt much use to new people looking to try. I say go for it, just...dont expect to stay long.  I wish I could give this a sideways thumb for the current game.\n2 years ago I couldnt praise it enough but :sigh: times have changed","October 30, 2015","false","7.5"," 189 of 326 people (58%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","58","189","326","25","29"

Just so much of the look of this game is executed well, there are a lot of zones that you encounter through progression that are amazing to behold compared to most other MMOs.\n\nThe quests are your run-of-the-mill "kill 10 rats" type. The story is interesting at parts, and there are actually a few that hit pretty mature themes and the brutality of war... however, these may be glossed over easily because of the grind-y nature of the quests and the quest hubs that lead the players through each area. This problem is even more apparent with the story line missions that will pop up at set levels, progressing the story even if you have not finished the current arc (sometimes with spoilers!).\n\nCombat is what keeps me coming back to this game (and the art direction). Attacks feel fluid, combat is never static, even with heavy "tank" class. There is a very nice rhythm to the attacks, especially when they are chained though attack options. Lots of ways to customize the attacks as well as their follow-up chain skills. Fighting the BAMs can be a great deal of fun if the normal creatures during progression seem too easy.\n\nThere are quite a lot of social options, guilds, alliances, castles, pvp arenas, and dungeons to keep things fresh outside of leveling up.\n\nHell, it's free now too!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trieste08/recommended/323370/","trieste08","Trieste08","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trieste08/","15 products in account","TERA is one of those games that appears ever so rarely.\n\nWhile I'm not a fan of the way they advertise the whole "True Action Combat" thing all the time, (seriously, there are more action-based MMORPGs out there like Dragon Nest) I do like the overall gameplay it offers.\n\nSo, breaking it down into sections that I think are important:\n\n1) Graphics (9*/10)\n+ The graphics on this game are absolutely beautiful.\n+ If you can afford to crank all the sliders to the max, you're in for a real treat.\n- The game engine is poorly optimised, leading to some massive latency spikes every so often, usually in high player density areas like cities, raids or PVP battlegrounds.\n- Character models are very much recycled. Enemies are simply reskinned/recoloured/resized.\n*(Would be 10/10 if not for the poor optimisation.)\n\n2) Sound/Ambience (7/10)\n+ The sound is generally well-made, though some of the voices on the female characters are a little grating to listen to repeatedly.\n+ Ambient effects are present and pretty nice to listen to, if you're the kind of person that likes to explore the world and stuff (waterfalls are quite relaxing).\n- I turned down the game music a lot because of PVP and needing to listen to the audio cues on skill effects and such. The variety of player voices is pretty low, though it's more of a personal preference than anything.\n\n3) Combat (7/10)\n+ Depending on your class, combat is either a carefully thought out dance of death, or a total faceroll on the keyboard. The one thing that remains consistent is that if you are soloing something, you'll always be kept on your toes deciding when to dodge, defend or back away from a monster while maintaining your damage output.\n+ Character classes are generally well-balanced, though the introduction of the Reaper and Gunner has skewed it slightly in their favour. The developers are paying attention however, and have been slowly introducing little tweaks to all the classes to bring them in line with the newer content.\n- Lock-on skills are sometimes very frustrating to deal with, as they will lock onto the first valid target under the mouse cursor. This can be troublesome when you are playing a healer and are trying to keep your party alive with targeted heals or when you are locking on targets for a multi-hit skill and it picks up a monster you'd rather not aggro at the moment. The problem is highly solvable, and players with enough experience know how to skip targets.\n- Movement is severely limited in combat, often forcing you to rely on the dodge skills to get significant distance or gearing specifically for movespeed. Ranged classes fare better due to being able to kite enemies, but the lack of mobility is something that annoys me greatly, though I understand its function as a balancing mechanic.\n\n4) Content (6/10)\n+ Playable content is varied, ranging from the standard fetch, escort and kill quests to the talk and crafting quests.\n- If you've played other MMORPGs before, all the content is pretty standard.\n+ There's always a bunch of stuff to do, as long as you're above level 60.\n- You need to reach at least level 60 to unlock the majority of the content.\n- You need to reach level 65 (the level cap) to unlock the BEST content.\n+ That said, the game itself is pretty enjoyable, despite the repetitiveness of quests before level 60.\n\n5) The Community (5/10)\n+ Generally positive. There are helpful people, there are not-so-helpful people.\n- If you play a PVP server, prepare for griefers. For some reason, max-level players often like to camp outside the newbie town and grief the newbies who are just starting out in the game. There are also people who will PK you simply for breathing the same air as they are.\n\n\nAddtional info: I've been playing this game casually for about a year now with two characters, Archer and Priest. Both are reasonably geared for their level and I try to participate in as much content as possible, PVE and PVP. I use the Steam client mainly when I'm too lazy to type my login credentials or need to fix the game without downloading the whole thing again.","September 2, 2015","true","108.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","14","16","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eilik/recommended/323370/","eilik","Eilik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eilik/","351 products in account","First and foremost, I played a bit before launch on steam, only ever got in my 30s level range. I mainly decided to play because it was launching on steam, and I had heard good things about the combat.\n\nCombat -\n\nQuick and intuitive, I love this game's combat. Like the trailer says, nearly everything is skillshot based. Even healing, which I'm learning a bit of. Dodging is satisfying, and the combat equally so. I do have a bit of a gripe though. And it's kind of related to combat. But that's for the next section.\n\nBalance -\n\nWith the new addition of the Gunner class it seems to outshine most of its competitors  in ranged dps. I don't know, as I've not played either archer or sorceror, but its mobility seems a great boon to the class in comparison to the others. I'm not sure how Reaper plays, as I've yet to play one either, so I can't talk about that. Either than that, the community seems biased towards certain classes, and against others. But if you play what you feel like, you'll have fun. And that's what it's about, playing what you think is fun, and possibly proving that bias wrong.\n\nGrind - I'm only level 30 or so at the time of this review, but I can say that I can see the grind already, but that's expected with a korean MMO, and frankly, the combat system makes this so much better. Since the combat seems to fresh, it's easier to take down monsters and not think about it. I got an achievement for killing 5000 monsters the other day, and was actually surprised that I'd already killed that many. World bosses are fun, as they're a break in the grind where you get to dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge around the battlefield as this thing clearly tries to eat your face. And every few levels or so you get shards to a new weapon for your level bracket that feels so much better when you finally find that last piece. All in all, this is one of the first korean MMOs where I do not mind the grind.\n\nVisuals:\nActually quite impressive. That's one thing I've learned from playing f2ps, you can find some real gems out there. Tera is one of them, while yes it's one that is definitely revelling in the sexualization that most korean mmos play on, it could be worse. It could be Scarlet Blade. But this isn't a review on that game so I won't get into detail. Now granted, it was a p2p that was converted to f2p.\n\nNow, something in between visuals and combat, I wanted to add. Monsters have signs, quite like monster hunter or other games, that show when it's going to unleash a big attack. This I like, as it's mostly fluid in every animation I've seen for a monster, and sometimes you have to look close to realize it's the telltale sign that you're about to have your butt handed to you.\n\nF2P-\n\nActually well done, most everything is cosmetic or rng based (lockboxes) purchases, experience bonuses and the like are able to be purchased, but that's not really p2w and as others have said before, double experience events are plentiful.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow I realize I've been going on and on about things that I like, granted I don't like everything. So, let's list some things I don't like.\n\nNegatives:\n\n-Gender-locked/Race-locked classes: Yeah, yeah, gripe at me, I'm sorry I understand why these classes are locked to specific genders and races, but I would still like to have an Amani gunner, or even a Popori reaper. You can only animate so much on a free to play budget, I understand, which is why this is really only a small complaint, however it does irritate me a little bit.\n\n-Balance: I've stated my biggest complaint here, but it's seeming more apparent as I level gunner, that why should I bother with either archer or sorceror?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheeKillerbeast/recommended/323370/","TheeKillerbeast","I got Sprout today ;)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheeKillerbeast/","122 products in account","*A quick note that needs to be said is, I played Tera in 2014 but then took a six month break and now I have returned. With that said, I am basing my review on what I know of when I played in the past. Most of my review will be correct but some points that I make might be out of date.*\n\nTera is a MMORPG game and is very popular and seems to be growing, definitely with the recent update. I think that everyone should try Tera out if you have any interest in MMO's. It's a FTP (Free To Play) and is not a P2W (Pay to win) game in any means.\n\nIt's well balanced and has a lot of content to keep you busy. You start off with just learning the basics and doing quests such as: talk to this guy, kill 10 monsters in this area, and so on. At the start it's very basic but when you level up you get a lot more in depth quests that make the game enjoyable for hours and hours at a time. Once you level up you start to get dungeon quests. When going into a dungeon you can do them solo but it's very hard so most people team up with a party of 5. You fight your way through the dungeon and you reach a boss and sometimes the dungeon will have more than one boss. These bosses are HUGE and super powerful and you need your entire team to be on their A game to defeat the boss. The dungeons are always a blast and you get some nice loot too :).\n\nAnother thing that you can do in Tera is forming Guilds. In a Guild you are able to of course be social with other players but you can do missions with them. You are given the option when you're in a Guild to do Guild missions which require people only from your Guild. I like this concept because it gives a reason for players to join a Guild and be social with other players. Another thing which I am not sure how popular it is but the idea is great. You are able to do GvG (Guild verse Guild) where you do exactly that. You PvP (Player verse Player) against other Guilds and your Guild has stats and ranks.\n\nThe combat system is something that I love about Tera. When you're in combat, you don't simply click on the enemy and watch your guy beat the monster up. That's not how Tera works at all. You actually have to aim all of your skills including your basic attack. I like this a lot because I feel like it makes the game a little harder which makes the skill cap higher. This also makes you have to work harder to become a strong player because if you can't land your skills when you're fighting a boss your team will know if you're slacking.\n\nJust like any other MMO there is a lot to learn. So if you're playing Tera and you find yourself lost just look up some guides on your class. Also play with friends! The only reason why I took a break from the game was because I didn't have anyone to play with. So be social in the game and invite your friends!\n\nHave fun and good luck in Tera!\n\n","May 5, 2015","true","144.6"," 28 of 42 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","28","42","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/merylsk/recommended/323370/","merylsk","Lady Phaedra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/merylsk/","312 products in account","So, I bought this game on May 30th, 2012, originally on EA's Origin platform. I had the CE, an early start and a founder package. You know, the works. I enjoyed what I saw at the time but due to my easily influenced brain, my friends at the time pulled me right back to World of Crack. It wasn't until just now, today, November, 8th, 2015 that I remembered I had all of that. And so, our journey begins.\n\nUpon logging in, my original character is still there waiting for me in some valley but I figure after so much time and likely tons and tons of changes, I may as well make a new character. So I whip up an Archer. This review is widely based on Archer gameplay (for 12 hours), but will include some other comments.\n\nPros:\n\n-Action oriented gamplay: There are very few MMOs that get this right. TERA is one of them. The movement is fluid, just like you'd expect from a decent MMO and the combinations of things are just super duper fun. As an archer I find myself bouncing around quite frequently, a far-cry from standing in one place and mashing one button.\n\n-BEAUTIFUL graphics. I can't even begin to describe how nice this game looks. Just loading up the character creator and the details on the character faces is mind blowing. Then you log in and everything is just super pretty. It is a pleasure to wander around in.\n\n-TERA is -actually- free to play. It's not pay to win, you can't just toss money at your character and kill everything with a button. Most of what's available on the cash shop is also available to players for gold, and nothing in the cash shop is an easy-win button. (which is great, because I'm on PVP server)\n\n-PVP! World PVP! I'm experiencing right now in TERA what I remember experiencing in my first moments of World of Warcraft and my leveling experience on a PVP server: paranoia. This may not be for everyone, but being on the edge of my seat while I'm leveling up and grabbing new gear is one of the best ways to not fall asleep.\n\n-Tons and tons and tons and tons of cosmetic options and superb character customization. Of course, you can make a funny looking character, but most of the time you can come out with something to your liking.\n\n-The variety of sounds that nofify you of accomplished goals are nice, they're not annoying. There's even a fairy side-kick thing that tells you when you have mail.\n\n-Achievements, for the obsessive.\n\n-Absolutely no shortage of quests to do\n\n-Very little restriction on crafting, because who doesn't love crafting?\n\n-Pets you can collect\n\n-Dungeons (haven't seen them yet, but I'm assuming they're at least a little fun with a good group)\n\nCons:\n\n-Elin. I have to mention this because it's the glaring, obvious thing to mention. I have an Elin myself, she's a cute little sorcerer that blows things to pieces and kills everything with fire, but judging by a lot of steam reviews and other people in TERA who happen to be playing Elin, some of them (I really don't want to say most) seem to be the waifu pedophile crowd. So it is definitely a con for me to be forming a group and wondering which one of my party members is a sexual predator.\n\n-The community (the vocal part that you see speaking in chat channels). This is almost always a con in just about any online game that allows people to speak to each other publicly. It is your typical out-of-touch with reality manchild fare who think Donald Trump is a legitimate choice for the 2016 presidential elect and have such a weak grasp on social issues you wonder how they go outside and make friends.\n\n-Quest variety. Although there are many, many quests to do, there needs to be more variety, and this is kind of a small con because it doesn't really bother me all that much. I come from a long line of MMOs in my history, starting with Anarchy Online. A game in which you spent nearly all of your time just sitting around in the wilds killing mobs for loot and experience and no written goal telling you where to go. Not a huge con for me, but likely a bigger con for others.\n\n-Armor variety. So far, from level 1 to 21 on my Archer, almost all of the armor is the same exact texture with a different color filter placed over it. I hope it starts to look cooler at some point.\n\nOverall, this is a great free to play MMO. I have spent a lot of time looking for one that can actually hold my attention and TERA is it. If you can look past these cons then definitely give it a go.","November 7, 2015","true","61.7"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","4"

I did however play every class to level 20 before settling on the Mystic(level 58 at the time of writing), So I deleted lots of characters.\n\nPros:\n-Not PAY to WIN!  I haven't spent a dime on it, but after looking at the hours I've put in, I'll most likly buy a level sixty ticket and an extra character slot just too feel like I've paid for it in some respect.\n-Lots of classes too choose from. 2 tanks, 2 healers, and a whole mess of DPS\n-Nice graphics! The best I've came across in a FTPMMORPG\n-Easy to get into combat, but has lots of stuff to master as you reach into the end game.\n-Broker is very easy to navigate, and if you have the time can yield lots of gold that you can use to buy some really nice stuff, without having to grind instances for.\n\nMeh Stuff:\n-On my server there are over 15,000 guilds, Anyone and his brother can make a guild.\n-Global chat can be a bit cru.....just turn global chat off, and save yourself a headache.\n-There seems to be a beach volley ball thing going on this summer...be prepared to see teen and adult characters both male and female, barley dressed, and going into a dungeon of darkness with extra dark shades on.\n\nCons:\n-Graphics: This is NOT gonna run on your Mother's laptop!  If it does then it's a good thing you're already in the basment, cuz that hardware..... It's gonna get hot.\n-Lag: The combat system needs a good solid conection to be worth anything. A one second delay after you press a dodge, block, jump, heal, or timed attack will have you screaming at your screen. If you find your server lagging, play something else for an hour.\n-Did I mention beach volley ball?\n-Quests are just as lame as every other MMO I've ever played, don't expect much there.\n-Huge Game: takes forever to download on slower conections.\n\nTips:\n-Use the free Elite pass that comes when you make a new account: You get double XPs, a fast mount, and two loot boxes(one of which will give you something you can sell at the broker for a good chunck of gold).\n-If you like playing instances without A LOT of wait time in Que, play a healer or a tank.\n-Turn "OFF" Global Chat!\n-The Gunner is the ultimate solo machine if you don't feel like being in a group.\n-If you are having problems logging in, sometimes you have to bypass steam and load the game's .exe(don't forget your password after you make the account). I also had to completly remove AVG off of my rig as it had conflicts with Tera.\n\nIf you have the free time, and are looking for a good solid MMO to play, then you have found it.","June 18, 2015","true","314.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","0"

If you enjoy the combat system and the average storyline, this Tera will be fun. However, if you want to have any motivation to play this game after reaching max level, look to another MMORPG. This game is completely unbalanced and unrewarding in the endgame content.\n\nThere's two major things to do in the end game, dungeons and PvP. Regarding PvP, most of the battlegrounds are equalized so one doesn't need gear to compete in them. You do need crystals and some other consumables, but that's all. Therefore, there is no reason to get any new gear or run the dungeons unless you want to play 1v1 matches. Yet, the 1v1 matches are completely skewed towards certain classes. This was done intentionally to have peope switch classes and purchase the new cash shop items. Then there's lag and desync that makes it hard and unfufilling to PvP at all.\n\nPvE content is also skewed towards the same classes, as Brawler can tank an instance and do almost double the damage of an average DPS with the same gear. All of the older classes are completely inferior in every way for all the PvE content. Gunner in dungeons don't even have to move or worry about health, as they have a bot that heals them and high damage ranged attacks.\n\nThis game had a lot of potential, but was ruined by imbalance and cash-grabbing. In future patches, some of the issues are addressed, but as the whole the creators are not addressing the many problems in the game. As they continue to release more and more flashy classes that lag everyone to death.","January 10","false","192.6"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","22","33","2","0"

D3M1G0D | Ringme","http://steamcommunity.com/id/D3M1G0D/","271 products in account","I have been playing this game for over 2 years now, and I can honestly say its a great MMO.\n\nThe combat is exceptional, no question about it, although the questing is a bit bland and standard.\n\nEndgame in TERA consists of mostly of PvE content. PvP content still exists, but it is nowhere near as plentiful as PvE content. Dungeons in TERA are the most challenging of any MMO I've played. The trinity system is very much alive in this game, you need to do your job and you need to be able to rely on your teamates to complete the endgame dungeons. Most of the time, if 1 party member ♥♥♥♥s up its a wipe and you will probably start all over. if you want an example of the difficulty, the most recent dungeon, Dreadspire, is a 20 floor dungeon that gets harder for each floor you ascend to. That particular dungeon has been out for 3 months and NOBODY on my server (lake of tears) has cleared it yet, not even the most geared players.\n\nSkill does play a big factor in this game. I personally have killed players who were wearing the top PvP gear in the game by being able to play my class better than they can play theirs, all while I was wearing a lower tier of PvP gear. As an example that this is possible here is a video of a player wearing a low tier of PvE gear killing a player wearing top tier PvP gear.\n\nIs this game pay 2 win? No not really. You can spend real money to buy costumes, mounts, RNG boxes, etc from the cash shop, and them sell those for in game gold to players. Personally, because of the fact that everything from the cash shop except cosmetics are easily available in game, and gold is easily obtainable, I do not consider this pay2win.Does this game sexualize females? Sure it does, but before you go all SJW on my ♥♥♥ take into account that males are sexualized just as much as females in this game, and there are plenty of costumes available in game or via cash shop that arent very revealing. That whole argument is pretty stupid, grow the ♥♥♥♥ up tumblr.Is leveling boring? It honestly depends on how you level. You can hit the level cap in 24 hours if you grind it out, but its not as enjoyable as questing and clearing dungeons. I DO NOT reccommend using one of the level 58 scrolls, because you will be at a disadvantage. Think of 1-65 as a giant tutorial on how to play your class, if you skip all that you will end up getting your ♥♥♥ kicked. Is this game grindy? Sure it is, but compared to games like archeage, the grind is nothing. Its a korean MMO, so expect RNG and grind. Personally I like it, because I EARN my gear. The grind in this game rewards you well, and you feel like you acomplished something worthwhile after you reach your goal.Is crafting important? Yes, very. Crafting is expensive to max out, but once you do it is a great way to make money, and the only way some endgame gearsets are made. Of course crafting itself is pretty standard, youbuy a recipe, learn it, gather all the mats, and auto craft the item at a forge.\nThis game is not for everybody, but if you try it out I implore you to stick with the game at least a week after hitting the level cap. This is one of those MMOs that opens up at endgame, and a chunk of players give up at lvl 40-50. Also remember that your class will be slow and clunky at first, but will become more fast and fluid at level cap.","June 7, 2015","true","272.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Oh, my, god. That was when the fun began. See, we went to the Freedom Plaza, where we noticed alot of little-girl characters. We decided to have some fun, and began yelling stuff at them like "Hey, little girl, we got candy, come with us in our van". Most of them ran around screaming. We continued to do this, until two in-game elves dressed as cops, and in cop-car mounts, began chasing us. We told them, that we "Din do nuffin", but they didn't believe us, so we hid in a bush. We said something along the lines of "I'm just a bush. Pffhthththt.", but they didn't believe us. "Put your hands behind your back", they said. "I can't, they're in my pants", my friend responded. We then made a daring escape, and managed to hide in a nearby smith. We returned to the plaza some few minutes later, where some of our previous victims had left. We still managed to find more little lolis, that we continued to hunt. Most of them got away, but this last one, she led us out of the city. She led us right into the claws of great beasts, with power that killed both me and my friend. But at my dying breath, I said "Satan will resurrect me! Hail Lucifer!".

The gameplay and combat are like beast,graphics,animations,terrain, and others too. I do appreciate the developers of this game for making it,it is much better when you play it than just looking at the trailer and judging games. Do not judge games by its trailer, just like do not judge books by its cover.Thankfully this game right here has been released on steam now that i can play it now ( i couldn't play it when i downloaded it off from the website.Now i can finally play this game that i wanted, and it came out just like i expected it to be.It just sucks you into the game like instantly, you will be amazed of what this game has...","May 7, 2015","true","3.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

Obviously by how much time I spend on it. I have many characters and I love each one. The community can be a bit toxic at times, but that's okai. I made some friends. Lost some friends. The game seems to have up and downs with patches, but in the end they always fix it. Yes, some classes are gender locked and race locked, but if you people would stop demanding new classes constantly...they would have more time to make the animations and such for other races and genders as well. It takes a lot of time to get out the animations and skills. Give them a break.\n\nAnyways, the game is literally free to play. Which is super nice! You can buy things to help you level faster or cosmetics...but other then that you can get a lot within game and earning them! Tera doesn't require you to pay some hidden fees for stuff. They LISTEN to their community. They are amazing with support. This IS my favorite game and the one I play the most. Even for a time waster...it is great. The visuals are great..althought some complain of low FPS from bad optimiztion. It has some things it needs to work on, but so does every MMORPG out there. Stop complaining.

I downloaded the game through Gameforge[de.tera.gameforge.com] back then and it seems that the steam version is only for new accounts via enmasse entertainment[www.enmasse.com].\nSo if you wanna play this game after a long time with your old account, then dont try it via steam like me...\n\nEDIT:Although gameforge is for EU and En masse for NA, I dont really get why there exists more then one launcher and why you cant use your account for the other launcher.\n\nI already have hundreds of hours in it and this game is a lot of fun.\nI am writing this review from my memory and its about a half year ago that I havent played it.\nYou have the Elin's (Lolis) and about 5-6 other races, but nearly everybody is playing with Elin and some of them have classsic japanese swimsuits too...\nThe graphics are really nice but the thing that I love in this game is the community. At least the german community on my server. Never read so funny ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ things, even when guilds wants to recrut people. I havent played since the level cap was changed to 70 (I believe) but in those days there was only one problem for me and my guild.\nAt the same time the fighting system is really addicting and I would say its medium complicated, so it dont have thousands of skills like WOW or 10 as in GW2. So there are not to much so yo ucan easily keep track of all the skills and not just a few.\nThe endcontent in this game wasnt that much compared to WOW or FFXIV or other MMORPGs.\nAfter reaching endcontent there is much to do like dailys and weeklys but I personally think it didnt last as long as it should.\n\nI highly recommend this game for everybody new to this game, cuz I had a fun time playing this game even though it might not be as long as other MMORPGS.\nBy the way I dont really know if I should give this game a positive or negative recommendation, because its kinda both of 'em","May 18, 2015","true","0.3"," 26 of 42 people (62%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","62","26","42","7","1"

Though very annoying, these individuals do not reflect the majority of the community. You can simply avoid being PK'd by switching channels.\n2) Gear Carry - In the end game PvP, outside of equalized arenas, gear plays a HUGE factor in your success. The difference between a +15 and +12 set of gear can be immense. On the bright side, most of the massive PvP options are equalized, meaning each persons gear equalize to a norm, and in those match ups, only skill matters.\n3) RNG - Like any Korean MMORPG, there is A LOT of RNG involved. Be that good or bad, is entirely up to you.\n\nPROS:\n1) The World - My first play through of the story line and journey through the world was gorgeous. I've played my share of MMO's, and this one, by far, is the most beautiful I've ever seen. If your computer can handle the max settings on graphics, then definitely do it. Each region has it's own theme, and each skill you use has it's own impactful feeling.\n2) The Combat - The combat in this game is something else. No more standing around smacking the boss and hoping for a crit. No more rock-paper-scissors PvP. The combat in this game is all anticipations and reactions. Even during bosses that you've fought hundreds of times, you'll still find yourself dying, as you misinterpret an action, or misstep a dodge. Needless to say, the PvP is very skill based as well. If you're looking for a slow and boring combat system, this game is NOT for you.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this game to my buddies.\nThe early levels may be hard, but the end game is worth it.\n40 vs 40 open world Guild vs. Guilds, just spontaneously happening everywhere. Defend/Siege Castle PvP matches. Hunting down outlaws in openworld.\nFor those more interested in PvE, I don't know what to tell you, as I am personally a fan of PvP.\n","May 7, 2015","true","716.5"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","2"

It is one long gear grind after another. Wait six months for a new patch just to start the grind over again, and ingame events are few and far between. The ones that do come are generic "collect x of this and exchange them for one of these (mostly ♥♥♥♥) prizes, or "double jackpot chance on these boxes you need expensive keys to open".\n\nAs someone who's gone through the grind and come out at the end with +15 lucid gear (best in slot), it is not worth the time investment. The content present in Tera is too repetitive, and too unrewarding. You will get nowhere without elite status, nowhere without a good guild, nowhere without multiple alts to farm on, and nowhere without running various dungeons as many times a day as you can. The amount of grind for the negligible boosts in stats is insane, and there's no challenging content that requires top gear to clear either.\n\nAnd no, the combat with its messy hitboxes and unbalanced PvP does not make it worth it.","March 1","false","421.6"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","72","13","18","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zhaed/recommended/323370/","Zhaed","Ahriman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zhaed/","187 products in account","TERA is a dynamic game where you have to pay alot of attention.\nUnlike most other MMORPGs, it requires you to dodge, block and counter attacks, aim properly and just be constantly moving in general. This makes the game more skill based; It doesn't matter how strong your gear is if you're not utilizing it properly. The visuals are fantastic for an MMORPG that was released in 2011 and I personally am a huge fan of the race as well as armor designs. The game does a good job at supporting new players and leveling up from 1 to 65 will never feel grindy or tedious unless you're a solo priest (sob). You have a lot of freedom over how you want to level up, there are many ways as soon as you hit level 22.\n\nOnce you reach the endgame content, things will start to get very grindy (as it should be). Gear will start to get more difficult to obtain as you have long cooldowns on the 5-man 65 instances (at least 5 hours) and getting the materials to improve said gear will not be a cakewalk either. These endgame instances can be very intense and overwhelming on your first runs. They require everyone in the party to fulfill their role properly. Even if you're just a damage dealer, you're actively screwing over everyone by not dealing enough damage. You need to know how to rotate your skills to deal the highest possible amount of damage. I advise you to always look up guides and watch videos first before you decide to run a 65 instance as inexperienced people will not only be frustrated from being one shotted over and over but aggravate the entire party too. Finding a PVE guild that supports new players and helps them gear up is the best way to face the endgame, so join one if you can. Having a static party in general is far better than being matched with random players. Unfortunately I cannot say much about PvP as I am more of a PVE guy but I found a short series of pictures[imgur.com] that sum it up rather well.\n\nThis game has a cash shop, so of course that makes you wonder: Is it P2W?\nThe answer is: Absolutely not.\nI love the way they handled their game going F2P and other devs should take note of this.\nThe cash shop allows you to buy mounts, costumes etc. which don't influence your stats or skills in any way.\nYou can also buy an elite status membership which gives you a gold and EXP boost, more instance runs as well as some other convenient goodies but it's not really worth the money.\nThe only advantage that players which spend money on this game have over players that don't is that they have an easier way to make gold fast (by selling those cosmetics). However, there are many ways to amass a fortune without even paying a cent once you hit 65, so it's not a big deal.\n\nI used to play on EU and this is the only MMORPG that ever had me hooked (I've played MANY).\nI highly recommend this to anyone that is sick of static combat that forces you to get hit.\n\nAdd me if you're playing on Lake of Tears and have questions: Kud","June 5, 2015","true","608.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

É um novo estilo de gameplay completamente diferente do que tudo que você já viu, embora mesmo assim ainda tem umas falhas para mim, a principal é que eu não posso desviar se eu estou lançando uma magia por exemplo, ela não corta o cast, preciso esperar a magia lançar para então desviar do ataque do boss.\n\n- TERA tem um sistema de story quests interessante, é realmente bom mas não se anime tanto pois após upar seu primeiro e segundo char isso com certeza ficará massante, mas é um pro a se considerar.\n\n- Upar no jogo tem uma dificuldade... Mediana... Não espere que seja impossível ou muito fácil, você vai upar um pouco rápido se souber aproveitar o tempo. Uma boa dica é coletar um pouco de minérios,flores e essências enquanto estiver upando para tentar fazer algum gold e comprar xp boosts na AH.\n\n- As dungeons são muito bem feitas, jogar com certeza lhe deixará "feliz", pois é díficil de ver algum jogo que tenha uma decência de conteúdo hoje em dia, já que a maioria dos MMOs que saiem no mercado vem com apenas um objetivo, arrombar seu bolso e falir em 2 anos, felizmente TERA veio para ficar por mais muito tempo.\n\nCONS\n- Optimização horrível, não tenho muito o que falar sobre isso, pois qualquer um que se deu o trabalho de jogar por 2 horas já sentiu isso na pele, a optimização do jogo é terrivelmente mal feita, infelizmente esse jogo já existe a 4 anos e até agora nada dos desenvolvedores se importarem em pelo menos tentar fazer algo, um bom começo seria colocar canais na capital, assim evitando muito lag, já que o lag ocorre quando tem muitas pessoas em um lugar específico.\n\n- Falta algumas coisas para serem feitas no endgame, assim que eu peguei level máximo e comecei a fazer as dungeons eu senti falta de algo para preencher meu tempo, quando eu esperava na queue, quando eu esperava alguém entrar no meu LFG, quando eu estudava as mecânicas em guias, eu senti falta, um buraco eu diria... Eu não sinto falta disso em alguns outros MMOs que já joguei, como World of Warcraft ou RIFT, nesses jogos sempre tem algo para preencher esse tempo vazio.\n\n- Eu sinto falta de um pvp mais variado no TERA, o jogo tem um pvp bom mas infelizmente poucas BGs e até hoje a mais feita é CS, Kuma é uma vergonha, aquilo nem deveria ter lançado. As arenas e o sistema de castelo são bons, mas mesmo assim eu sinto um "vazio" que não sei como definir bem.\n\n- O jogo sempre tem conteúdo novo mas tem muito re skin de conteúdos passados, re skin de itens e muitas outras coisas. Fazer uma dungeon nova é sempre legal, porque realmente traz algo novo, algum boss diferente. Mas após jogar fora da dungeon você facilmente perceberá o íncrivel reaproveitamento de mobs e itens no jogo.\n\nDicas\n\n- Se você é como eu e não gosta de esperar muito tempo em filas, ou ficar dependendo de pessoas para fazer tudo, comece o jogo fazendo um tanker e um healer. Infelizmente parece que a Bluehole não da a mínima para a falta de tankers e healers no jogo, ela está trazendo alguns buffs para Warrior e Zerker mas todos nós sabemos que nada substitui o bom e velho tanker com shield. O jogo precisa urgente de novas classes de tanking e healing.\n\n- Procure guias de forma acidua, TERA foi o único MMO que joguei que eu que precisei correr atrás do endgame e não o endgame atrás de mim. Se você quer realmente conhecer TERA vai precisar se guiar muito bem para começar a ser alguém.\n\n- Farm, farm, farm e farm. Não tem nada para fazer? Já fechou aquela dungeon de hoje? Já ta com a profissão upada? Cansado de fazer PVP? Vá minerar, matar uns bams e coletar alguns itens, gold é muito importante nesse jogo.\n\n- Após chegar level máximo dê uma pausa para a sua cabeça, faça outra coisa, jogue algum outro jogo e encontre outra coisa para se divertir pois se logo após você upar os arduos 65 niveis e já querer partir para o endgame, você sentirá na pele, pois óbvio como em qualquer MMO não passa do "mais do mesmo", dê uma pausa para a cabeça e faça outra coisa por um semana, ae volte a jogar com tudo, você não irá se arrepender disso.\n\nApós todo esse review, eu posso lhe dizer que TERA é um jogo que não merece uma nota muito alta (Tipo 9 ou 10), pois tem médios erros no jogo que poderiam ser facilmente corrigidos, mas aparenta que a dev coreana está sentada em um trono de ouro e... infelizmente não se importa com isso.\n\n8/10 - O jogo é muito bom, possui erros que com certeza irão afetar a gameplay a longo prazo mas se você não se importar tanto, estiver cansado de jogar 300 MMOs diferentes para achar algo no mínimo aceitável, você com certeza ficará bem satisfeito no TERA por um bom tempo.","May 7, 2015","true","351.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rednoahl/recommended/323370/","rednoahl","rednoahl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rednoahl/","214 products in account","First and foremost Tera is a game that requires you to be good at your chosen class. The experience you have largely depends on you putting some work into learning your skills and how you aim and time them. Playing solo you can challenge yourself to some extemely tough content or you can party up and have a relaxed playthrough of the exact same content. Combat is really satisfying once you have developed your skill against players or PvE content.\n\nVisually Tera is really nice and the music is excellent too. I'm not too fond of the voice acting but I'm one of those people who doesn't like anime dubbed into English either. En Masse have worked hard on optimisation but Tera's performance seems to be inconsistant and is CPU bound so to get 60fps it took me a while to get the right settings. Some people have no issues with performance - it's just something you may need to be aware of.\n\nI find all the classes to be fun to play, but I do have issues with some of the races you can chose due to the dodge and jump animations being different between races. Tera also comes from the 'less is more' school of gaming where a lot of the armour is heavily sexualised but I play zoomed out to the max distance so it isn't an issue for me. If you play as a Castanic Female for example you'll spend a lot of time watching ♥♥♥♥ that you'll either find it comical or off putting.\n\nI've played on the North American version of Tera for a while now despite being from the EU. I've never had a positive experience with Gameforge (the EU publisher of Tera) so I was really happy when En Masse's version of Tera came on steam because steam makes in game purchases easy. En Masse's customer service is a credit to the gaming industry too. There are still physical copies of Tera available to buy from Amazon (make sure they're unopened and published by En Masse) that give you loads of content you would normally have to pay for; En Masse still honour the codes from these physical versions and if you input the code backwards you get additional content; worth baring in mind if you try and like Tera enough to warrant a purchase.","May 6, 2015","true","223.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Zero pay2win structure, so that's a plus. Paying helps, kinda, but nothing you can't earn with in game gold in a reasonable time frame. Class balance is somewhat chess-like in PvP and PvE: X is better than Y, and Y is better than Z, etc. The devs do a decent job listening to players and trying to add balance to play.\n\nPros:\n+Aim to hit, no tank and spanks.\n+Class variety is legitimate\n+PvP requires skill\n+Skill cap is high on all classes\n+iFrames (Invulnerable Frames) on some moves\n+Cosmetics are vast and amazing\n\nCons:\n-"Elite" status is over priced, though not required\n-Gets grindy end-game, but too be expected\n-PvP isn't parsed to level ranges\n-Quests are back and forth running\n-The switch to F2P seems to have ruined pacing on the story as you out level areas way too fast\n\nOverall, the game does a good job of entertaining, keeping you engaged, and providing a unique experience no matter what class you play.","July 10, 2015","true","357.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/323370/","kunovega","Kunovega","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/","194 products in account","All style no substance.\n\nShort version: This is a Korean MMO. For those with MMO experience that should tell you everything you need (you are either into Korean MMOs or Not; if not, run far far away).\n\nEdit: note that the .5 game time tracked is because I shut down steam when I play. I hadn't even thought about it tracking my hours played, I put about 20 or so hours into this simply because I'd heard good things from various people (including my neighbor IRL) and I kept hoping maybe the game would get better. (in comparison I have no problem putting in 100s or even 1000s of hours into legit good MMOs\n\nLong version:\n\nI can see how this game may appeal to certain kinds of players. It's a decent looking game that runs on minimal hardware and if you can stomach the shallow storylines the combat is mildly entertaining in short play sessions.\n\nThe problems however run the typical list of Korean short comings:\n1. terrible storylines: Yea some of the cut scenese are respectable but those are few and far between; the bulk of missions you do will be your standard fetch quest and kill list variety in the brain dead style of "oh you want me to find X and it's 3 feet to your left?".\n\n2. Linear world: if you stay on the path you will walk straight into everything you need to do, oh and you pretty much can't walk off the path so don't worry you don't need to think at all.\n\n3. Zero challenge of any kind: Sure it's an "innovative combat" system for an MMO, too bad it's super baby easy mode. Honestly I got to level 20 or so and hadn't been hit by an enemy yet. Read that again: I'm not saying I hadn't died yet... I had not been HIT yet. Apparantly "active dodge" system means you can just keep kiting forever and the mobs never figure out how to hit you. I'm not saying an MMO needs to be hard, but this didn't even feel like I was playing. I was just kinda walking down a path watching stuff die occasionally.\n\n4. Cheap boss moves: So when the game bothers to pretend it's going to offer you a challenge (oh look a boss fight!), yea that's not what this is. Instead what you get is the standard easy fight + 1 super cheat move. You spend most of the fight dodging, not getting hit, plinking away at a boss that has 10x the hp of the normal mobs and than does his cheat move. You get warped to in front of him (no matter where you are, no dodge), stunned in place for a while and slowly watch as he hits you with whatever special move he has. Insert boring long ♥♥♥ animation to show you that you were hit by something undodgable while you twiddle your thumbs with no buttons to push (because you are stunned for so long)\n\nThat's not interesting combat, that's terrible AI followed by a cheat move followed by terrible AI. In the end you will beat the boss the same as you beat anything else with no real challenge other than that one move that you cant dodge.\n\n5. Clunky interface: 1999 called, it wants it's MMO interface back.\n\n6. Indecipherable crafting system ~ granted maybe I didn't play long enough to figure it out, but what I did see felt like a mash up of every bad Korean crafting system I've seen before.\n\n7. Gender locked classes: I don't think I'd care about this one if they made sense in storyline. I mean you name something a Valkyrie and sure you kind of expect those to all be female; but that's not how it is in Tera. Instead you get most of the classes (and all of the newer ones including "brawler") that are female only, some of them are race and gender specific. Not because the storyline demands it but because the dev team doesn't feel like creating the models for other races/genders to be those things. It looks like lazy development, it feels like lazy development and when you read their dev blogs they basically admit the same.\n\n8. Somethings lost in translation. While it's not entirely broken Engrish there is definately something lost in translation. Much of what you hear/read while playing is either extremely generic or just slightly "off". One quest line (that goes on for several missions) is all about "the children, the children, wont someone think of the children", but you're pretty much saving "one girl", that's not children (it's a child... you don't know this?) and please stop quoting me drivel like "someone think of the children".\n\nSo many more missions go on like that with poor word choices and blanket platitudes that don't always fit the situation. If you like being hit over the head with platitudes this may be the game for you.\n\n8. It's not as inovative as it pretends to be. 5 minutes into playing this and my first impression was "this is really watered down first person shooter mechanics shoved into an MMORPG shell". A couple of hours later my opinion hadn't changed.\n\n9. It's free2play ~ This is both good and bad. If you are a 13 year old with no money, this may be the game for you. If however you are an adult that can afford to spend money, please spend it somewhere else. This game is a huge money sink and you get very little out of it. I had a pile of boxes in my inventory by the time I was done that all would require real money to open. After some google searches I came to realize that what I'd get from those boxes is random crap in the hope of something good. But you get so many it's a constant "please give me money". Look, I get it, devs need money to make games and I'll throw cash at good games all day long. But with a game this shallow I really don't want to be begged for money constantly.\n\nHonestly this felt like one of those free2play games where newbs sit around begging for cash in the starting city spamming you non stop except its the devs doing it here. Put some of that energy into making the game decent and maybe I'd have incentive to pay you.\n\n10. The grind, the grind, the endless grind. If you've played Korean MMOs before you know what I mean. There's nothing different here. It's grind or go home.\n\n11. Stupid loot system. Every mob you kill drops crap all over the place. Every kill you make becomes a tedios explosion of individual items to pick up one at a time. God forbid you kill a group of mobs all at once, can you just loot once and pick up everything? Nope, you get to walk around picking up each individual item. It's almost a (bad) mini-game unto itself. Annoying busy work is what it really is.\n\n12. The community is terrible. You're in a game where most of the classes are gender locked but the idiots who play are too immature to not pick on each other about it. "I bet you're not a real girl" leads to one fight after another after another into endless loops of childish tantrums in general chat. Like seriously if you wanted to play a gunner or a brawler you HAD to pick female, there was no other choices. This basically amounts to "you must be homosexual if you played tomb raider because the main character there is female and thats for girls".\n\nI really felt like I was surrounded by little kids who think the epitomy of conversation is "neener neener pants on fire" and quite frankly that would have been an upgrade from most of the pointless trash talk. There wasn't even a reason to trash talk, they were just too bored of the game so they sit around picking on each other for something to do.\n\nI could go on, but you either get the point by now or you don't. I've played memorable Korean MMOs before (Aion comes to mind), but this one falls on the heap of crap I hope I don't remember by tomorow (along with 100s of other forgettable Korean MMOs). But I'm pretty sure most of the development budget was spent on making nice looking boobs and not on making a decent game.\n\nIn summary:\nThe game is a bad first person shooter combined with a mediocre RPG and slapped with a label of "Look at me I innovated". No you really didn't, you took a big steaming dump on the MMO universe and than bragged about it as if no one else takes big steaming dumps. At least I have the courtesy to leave mine in the toilet.","March 15","false","0.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","3"

One of the best MMOs, in my opinion. I will say, however, that it's better to play with friends just because grinding can get boring really fast and waiting for a party to form to enter dungeons can take a lifetime. Like seriously, no joke.\n\nOne thing I really love about the game would have to be the character customization. I gotta admit, I'm a sucker for good character customization. There's a big selection to choose from, so you'll definitely find something to fit your style. The only thing about it that I dislike would have to be how some of your choices impact other features...like, a certain hairstyle comes with a specific eye color (which you can't change, if you wanted to) - beauty features, such as makeup, can also change the eye color, so it's just something that you'll have to work with.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's not complicated at all. Even people new to the whole mmorpg scene will quickly get used to the controls. The battles are like any other open world mmo, but it's all about your character's class that will make it more exciting (especially when you're testing out new skills). Also, running while in battle is significantly slower, so if you bit off a little more than you could chew and decided to flee, then prepare for the slowest retreat of your life (at least until battle mode disappears). And don't forget, when you're running through the open world, to take some time to appreciate your surroundings because the graphics are quite nice too :)\n\nNow, about the community... it doesn't seem bad, but it's not all that great either. Honestly, it seems a bit difficult to make friends on here, mostly because people are off doing their own thing. Like I mentioned earlier, it's more fun to play with friends in this game; so I can assume that's what most people are doing in Tera, instead of going through the hassle of hunting people down to make friends. Playing solo isn't necessarily bad either, I suppose, so long as you don't succumb to boredom quickly. If none of your friends play Tera and you don't want to play solo, there are groups that you can join on Steam where people would be more than happy to join you.\n\nOverall, I really love this game and it's quickly become one of my go-to MMOs. The gunner class is just amazing, so if you're curious about it then I'd definitely recommend trying it out (especially if you like blowing ♥♥♥♥ up)! If you're thinking about playing Tera, I'd say go for it - it's free, fun, and there are always new and exciting updates for you to enjoy :)","October 21, 2015","true","137.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The only complaints I have really is the lack of story (as far as quests and lore are concerned) and cash shop prices (which is fairly typical in a free to play game) so it's not so bad.\n\nThey've revamped and rehauled a lot of zones and quests to ease leveling and create more fun scenarios  since launch and I'm interested to see how the Steam launch will affect the game's community.

Plenty of ways to improve your avatars performance with gear and specialization, cosmetics and customization to change looks, Pets and Mounts.  The game has great graphics.\n\nThe different races looks vary greatly providing variety and satisfying many tastes.  The universe has a japanese anime feel, reminding me of Final Fantasy game crossed with Dungeon and Dragons.  It is easy and quick to solo level and has group content.  Has PVE- Roleplay and PVP servers. Has crafting.\nDoes not look pay to win at beginning.  Store has plenty to sell you.  Some classes are gender and race locked.  Free players have 2 slots per server but able to make avatars on each server.  Might run out of bank space if you are a packrat or a crafter, forcing you to pay store for bank space.

Been a couple years and have a few lvl 65's now and it still puts a smile on my face in PvP, and PvE is still challenging even with the right gear, The game is challenging with the true action combat, keeps you on your toes. If a boss enrages and is about to slam the ground, you either jump out of the way with dodge skill, or your 1 shot dead. Thats endgame of course, the earlier bosses along the way+ BAM's train you along the journey to 60/65.\nThis game is NOT pay to win. It has a cash shop that deals with mostly cosmetic items/mounts and such. You do get bonus xp from being elite member, but you can also just buy an XP scroll on the broker with in game gold for super cheap. One of the best F2P experiences ive ever dealt with. I play free for years and have a blast! I do reccommend for people finding a niche after WoW like I did. Fantastic game, PvP anyone you want go outlaw and have fun lol, If you dont like that, you can always join a PvE server.

It strives to be a great MMO. Its intro island and story-line are more than adequate. The graphics are truly excellent, beholding at times. The sound effects and music are great. The quests are standard MMO fair, with some twists. The dungeons are logical and storyline quests tie into each one. Sometimes you get there before you have quests, which is fine. The UI and such are good - makes most of efficiencies I would say. Broker/Auction house is pretty nifty, clean and well laid out. The cities are beautiful as are the forests, deserts and snowy areas. As you level, you have villages that act as quest hubs. It pairs with the story line and works out rather well. There are more than enough quests to level.

Also, dayum races\n\nyee I think that's fine, this game is a 9/10, only bad things, I would've love a voiceacting for the quests, it gives more life to the game, but overall the game is freaking good.","May 9, 2015","true","10.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LightThisCity/recommended/323370/","LightThisCity","noot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LightThisCity/","30 products in account","I haven't had much experience with MMO's other than Tera, I dabbled in a few others, but none stuck with me until Tera. I first started playing when Wonderholme was the new instance. Note I play on a PvE server. This game is F2P and most of the items you can purchase with real money is only cosmetic. Though if you do subscribe and get Elite Status, or buy consumables it helps a lot. Though it isn't needed and not that noticeable unless if you plan to tunnel vision into this game. In that case having Elite helps a lot, being able to have more production points (gathering, crafting) and being able to run instances more than the average user (some instances have a time limit until you can run it again)\n\nPros:The combat is amazing. It is the defining feature for most that play and think of Tera. It truly makes you feel powerful. It makes killing mobs really fun. With a ♥♥♥♥ load of skills and depth for each class it's possible you can never get bored of just playing one.\n\nThis game's pvp is one of the most dynamic I've ever seen, Gear matters a lot, but so does skill. An under geared character can easily take out a better geared one if the difference skill is great enough. though lag and net code can hinder this at times. D-sync can also be pretty frustrating as well.\n\nCustomization of characters, with numerous costumes and races it's not hard to make a character that you'd truly enjoy. (Who doesn't want to decimate mobs as a kawaii loli?)\n\nThis game is beautiful. With the numerous environments, dungeons and more. This game is truly eye candy. (If your pc can run it, the lower/lowest settings are okay, but nothing special ofc)\n\nDungeon design is fantastic. Each dungeon is fun and unique with monsters and bosses with different mechanics.\n\nVariety of mobs, monsters and enemies. There's so many different things to kill in this game. There's small minions to BAMS(Big ♥♥♥ Monsters) and the design is truly fantastic\n\nIf lore is your thing, than the lore of Tera is really imersive. The wonderful environments doesn't hurt.\n\nCons:This game can be pretty harsh to newcomers, especially in instances and pvp. But this can be said of any game.\n\nUnless lore is your thing (for most that play mmos it isn't), leveling is pretty boring and typical of a mmo. Typical kill a # of mob quests, the occasional escort quest, go to point a to point b to talk to some dude, and having the dungeon be the end of a quest arc, etc.\n\nThe endgame is expensive(in in game currency, not real) and extremely grindy. You don't have to spend money to succeed in the game. but expect to run the same dungeons and dailies over and over again to get enough mats, points, etc. to make your end game gear. The grind is real. If you're truly dedicated, be expected to put in a ♥♥♥♥ load of hours, as expected of a Korean MMO\n\nUnless if you're really into pvp there isn't much to do after you have achieved your desired endgame gear. Do you expect to run the dungeons you've been running countless time to get your endgame gear? Most people get sick of the grind before they get there.\n\nSolo play. For those who like to play solo, you can solo up to the max level with no trouble, but after that you really need to be in a guild to succeed in the endgame.","May 6, 2015","true","284.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSaintsVampire/recommended/323370/","TheSaintsVampire","Enchantment","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSaintsVampire/","181 products in account","I have been playing Tera since it's initial NA release back in 2012. It was my first real introduction into the MMORPG genre. Before Tera I had dabbled in a bit of World of Warcraft and EVE, but, ultimately, I left those games behind due to a lack of interest. However, with Tera, I never felt that way. I never thought "I'm done with you. We're over."\n\nIf you are someone who has never played an MMORPG then I would recommend Tera to you. If not to broaden your horizons. The game offers hundreds, thousands of hours of enjoyment that can be shared between you and your friends. Find a guild, meet new people (Maybe even create your own.) For those who commonly play these types of games, I still recommend Tera if you haven't already given it a chance. The games combat is interesting and fun, end-game bosses offer challenge to those who would face them, and heck, you may find you love the game.\n","May 9, 2015","true","232.7"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

I love having gear that only truly dedicated players can obtain. But then it comes down to making it worth while by enchanting it.\n+9... is annoying for top tier gear.\n+12, is a joke when it comes to how high the failure rate is....\n+15? You might as well buy the damn equip from another player with how often this will fail on you.\nhave failed over 90 tries from +12 to +13.\nLet's calculate that... 1 try is 100 MWA (you'll know these terms once you get to know the game.) + 200 feedstock.\nMWA goes for around 29-35 gold each.\nFeedstock goes for around 7-10 (at the time)\nSo 29-35 times 100, and 7-10 times 200 TIMES 90 FAIL'S which do NOT give any materials back.\nYou can definitely DEFINITELY farm all of the above, and that is where the weeks to months of grinding statement comes into play. Allll of that work, time, dedication, and n some cases money for those who think "I'm going to make this a sure thing and invest a bit of money in the game to get more materials from other players so i can have even more of a chance of success!!!" only to see that 9 fail's go to 120 quickly...\nDon't believe me? Look it up, lol.\nThousands of gold, and material's farmed over the course of weeks and months gone down the drain.\n\nNow I understand making things difficult and not so easy, but to make the game fail THAT much where it's become the norm when people put so much time and effort into your game? That is a slap in the face to the players in my eyes.\nNow it definitely makes you feel awesome when you're walking around with that +15 let me tell you!, but it's.... just not worth it... at all...\nBecause you know what? 6-7 months later, a new set is out and you have to do it alllllllllll over again. And your luck could be better this time around, or even worse!!!\nI've seen cases where they had over 160 tries to get just to +13!\nThere should be a guarantee after a certain number, seriously. That is TOO much required player dedication for one patches equips that are going to be obselete sooner than later.\n\nAnd the community.... is... just... a virus...\nI don't get involved with them much myself because I generally do not care, but it's just something to note for those who do.\nI love the battle system, and a good portion of the games mechanics, but it's just lacking that "something" which is pushing a lot of loyal players away. Hell, I've seen entire guilds quit and move to a different game because this game just get so repetative, and boring.\nWhy do I play? My girlfriend happens to be one of those super addicted individuals, and is a damn good healer, lol.\nI tank, so we're always needed as a pair, and I simply love spending time with her.","January 12","false","20.3"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","11","18","2","0"

If you think it's like others you would be wrong. The combat system makes this game awesome the person behind the toon skills matter. One of the things i love about Tera it is free to play but it's not pay to win!! This is rare in a free to play and this game known as Tera is a rare breed as well. There is no getting to max level in a few days. There is a scroll you can buy that gets you to max level but it's like $50. Having this scroll in game hasn't hurt the game.Also if used you won't have maxed gear or the gold to level all your skills so there is that. Thinking about giving Tera a try stop thinking and JUST DO IT!!! You will not regret it.

ALTHOUGH, you might wanna get a good system spec for the highest settings with a smooth fps.\n\n-The world exploration is never boring, it may even actually be better than WoW in some players' opinion\n\nGuild Domination:\n-Top guild gets to have their own FLOATING ISLAND castle which are limited around the world and is fixed at a position. Guild Masters need to battle it out to reach the top 20(?) to own 1 of these prestigous base that contains more feature for players to access in for their guild.\n\nbesides that, theres nothing more to show really... TERA is your typical WoW-like MMO that has better stuff in everything than WoW does, although you'd need a good system spec on your PC to truly enjoy it. and be glad this is free now, it used to be pay2play like WoW too.\n\n-Elin best race. 7/10","November 27, 2015","true","153.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's pretty solid and even with high latencies (of over 180, for example) you can still experience a good gameplay against NPCs ant other players, unlike other current competitors. The combat is pretty similar to Monster Hunter's, but faster and more frenetic. Learn enemy attack patterns and properly position yourself in the battlefield are extremely necessary on end game PvE and PvP contents.\n\nOne of the few cons I have about this game is the early game, which is kinda repetitive (kill x number of monsters and so on). Most of its story is telled by texts, If the developers had properly invested on it and dubbed NPC voices it would make it waaay more attractive to players. And the game's lore is good, just need to be told in the right way.\n\nTalking about F2P, I have been playing this game for 2 years and I can assure you that is not Pay to Win. Most of the cash shop items are just cosmetics and you can even buy them from other players on trade broker. In-game currency is kinda easy to accumulate, so no worries about losing your social life to get that so desired weapon skin.\n\nIf you are looking for an action fantasy MMORPG, that is fun on both PvE and PvP, give TERA a shot! And don't give up early, the game reeaally shines on end game content!","May 6, 2015","true","13.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I did play things like Mabinogi and Maplestory long time ago but I didn't even enjoy them that much-- only played it so I can play with friends. I also played a bit of WoW, GW2, Archeage, but they didn't really suit me-- either I was bad or I didn't spend much time on them.\n\nWhen my friend first told me about TERA, it was pretty amazing and I liked it but I didn't really spend much time. Time passed, and I began to spend more and more time, eventually joining a large guild, obtaining diamond laurel, getting generation gear. This game get fun as long as you put your effort to get better and better-- that might be just me loving to learn more as I play though.\n\nThe story is pretty good if you manage to play through the quests. I completed them not too long ago, and I'm really excited to see what's next in the story. Gameplay however, won't really be affected by the story. If you are interested in lores, play through those red markers (except the event ones from roostock and tuwangi).\n\nMusic is decent. There are a handful of nice OST (you can go to youtube to listen to them too), but you won't really notice it majority of the time.\n\nGraphics are pretty damn nice. It's using Unreal Engine 3 so the game can be said it's a bit old. Environment/entities look really nice in this game for free to play (it used to be pay to play back in 2012). Really, one thing that pulled me to play this was the graphics.\n\nNow, the community isn't as bad as they seem, it's just that there are some trolls here and there but there are a lot of friendly people out there so don't be shy to ask on global.\n\nOnly bad thing I want to say though, if you have high ping, it's really hard to play. Also there are known framedrops and such due to bad UI, several lags here and there, but those won't really affect combat unless you open inventory or other UI.","June 27, 2015","true","379.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ohnodrim/recommended/323370/","ohnodrim","o'frey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ohnodrim/","54 products in account","One of the first things I noticed about TERA was how great the F2P model is. In a time where a lot of games are using pay-to-win microtransactions to make money, this game does not seem to be reliant on in-game purchases to be a powerful character. This makes the game especially enjoyable for anyone not interested in playing the game quite frequently enough to justify (or afford) a subscription.\nAnother great feature of TERA is the animation style. I was never a fan of the cartoon-y style that several MMOs have adopted (such as WoW and Rift), and fell in love with the graphics in this game. The game has much more realistic graphics than many other games, and the overall texture quality is pretty high; while this is a good thing for people with high-end computers, cheaper computers will have to sacrifice a lot of image quality to avoid lag, etc. The game does have diverse graphics options, however, so users can make their own choices about that.\nAs other players have mentioned, this game adopts a targeting system different than many MMOs. In TERA, character positioning is much more important because both npcs and players have to aim their attacks. This aspect gives a nice little change in a genre of games that typically are very similar.\nMy only real complaint with the game is the sexualization of characters. Amour can't be very effective when a majority of a character's chest is exposed, so clothing styles often feel out of place/unnecessary. Unfortunately, this trend is becoming increasingly common with games, but TERA does have less inappropriate clothing than many other games (and is not exclusive to female characters).","May 21","true","46.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

Same mechanics here.  Map, character builds, enemies, potions, weapon upgrades...if you've done LOTRO, you'll fast pick up this game.  But this is *not* LOTRO.  It is the the LOTRO if Tolkien had a great eye for sexy bodies and was slightly perverted, but wanted his monsters HUGE.\n\nF2P.  Not really a F2W.  Spoiled children can buy their way to rank, but you can earn your way up very quickly and for free.  You'll be better with your weapon and defensive skills by earning your way up.\n\nGET TO THE DUNGEONS!   The missions are a slow, fun way to learn at first.  About level 14-20, you want to figure out how to get to the dungeons.  Even if you don't Youtube games to learn, use YOUTUBE in this game to learn the old style commands that help you join dungeons and communicate with others, join a guild, etc.  But the dungeons give you hig armor and fast rank from kills, and you meet many new players that way.\n\nAnd this game is SEXY.  Very sexy (sometimes disturbingly so, but not overly disturbing - just enough to make you worry *for* the other person).  You'll screenshot your way through the game, guy or girl.  We all look good in this world, and who wouldn't love that?\n\n7/10 for people who have never done a MMOLG.  9/10 if you've played LOTRO in the past.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","June 26, 2015","true","192.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

That being said if you dont start on the proper server then you will begin to hate this game. I Say this because they have 4 server types. Role Play, PvP Role Play, PvE and PvP. If your a new player then DO NOT play on the PvP server. As a matter of fact, do not play on the pvp server at all. I say this because when you get to Lumber town, and Crescentia, you will be killed by Player Killers. YOU WILL BE KILLED not you MAY you WILL, because every PKer in that area is at least level 40-64 and they will one hit kill you with an ability. If your going there early game for the story quest dont be shocked to be killed a million times over by pkers. After that the PKers die down, then you get to the level 50 area. that is when the PKers return, and this time, they travel in parties! YAY!!!\n\nI liked the game, however my experiance was from starting in the PvP server. Pkers will show up with red names, so you can TRY to avoid them however you will just run into another, especially near Crescentia. And when you see a red name player, run to a camp or town until they leave, because even if you have pvp off, they can still attack you. All in all from my prior experience i cannot say that I would reccommend it, that being said i have been int he RP server and its fine, aside from the cancerous chat. Oh speaking of dont bother with chat, especially world chat, because all you will see in world chat is cancer and people smexing one another...\n\nAnother Thing i would like to point out is that once you get into the high lever areas, say 50-64, it is impossible to ♥♥♥♥ing level up without spending real money to get the XP boosters. That was another thing that drove me away, once you get to high level areas, the grind is real, and that isnt including the grind required to PROGRESS IN THE QUESTS.\n\nThe game is fun, its just the cancerous chat systems, and the horrendous grind late game without xp boosters that I dislike. That and the fact that Lighting Enrichment sucks up so much cpu i cant even run the game good with lighting enrichment on. Anyway, Don't be shy to try the game on the PvE server or the PvE RP server, be prepared for alot of ERP though.","November 19, 2015","false","75.8"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","5"

You don't need to grind too much and till level 20, you don't even need to worry about what armor you're using! Leveling up is easy and rather quick.

I gave it a real chance into my heart, and y'know what? It came out okay. It still has a lot of the same elements that MMORPG's and Japanese games have that I hate. But all in all, this is a fantastic experience I can't stop coming back to.\n\nFirst off, character creation. I hated it. Absolutely hated it. Everything looks stupid and so blown up and anime, that I wanna drill my eyes out. I play female characters more often than not. Not because "they're hot," or because I am or want to be. Just because I do. But there's absolutely no way to play a female character without ♥♥♥, and or ♥♥♥♥ thrown in everyone's ♥♥♥♥ing face. For god sakes they're practically naked.\n\nSecond off, mindless ♥♥♥♥ing questing. Another element from I think every MMORPG ever, is mindless ♥♥♥♥ing "talk to him, talk to her" quests that don't ♥♥♥♥ing matter. I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about your politics, I'm tryna fight ♥♥♥♥ and look cool. There has to be a better way of introducing story elements to me than this ♥♥♥♥. For such a "unique MMO" that's some real formula ♥♥♥♥ right there.\n\nI saved the best for last, however. The combat. The combat is by far the greatest thing I have ever seen in any MMORPG I have ever seen/played. It's fun, it's intuitive. It makes me feel like I'm using skill and a combat driven mind. It hints at Dark Souls, and really just feels like Monster Hunter. Because it basically is Monster Hunter. It's Monster Hunter but MMORPG and weirder. Regardless of the painful similarities to an all-round better game, Tera is still the most fun I've ever had in any MMORPG ever. So, yeah, thumbs up.","September 15, 2015","true","28.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They give you the option to pay for stuff, but it's more of a convenience than a necessity to win. I've taken the time to look through the items on the store, and honestly everything on there was more aesthetic or account based than it was this helps you win the game. The majority of items were character accessories and mounts, and a few things for your account like an additional character slot or leveling packs. The only thing that might be considered a little pay to win is the fact that they gave you the option to automatically level a character to level 60 by spending cash. I found that pretty interesting, it didn't seem like it would help too much unless you had friends willing to help you get gear and money, or you already had the necessities for the character, but to each their own. I personally enjoy the time spent leveling my character makes it feel more satisfying than paying basically $50 to get a character to level 60 with no work, that's just my personally preference. The only thing I might consider buying is a permanent mount that can be used by any character on my account\n\nI'm a gamer on a budget so finding this game was ideal for me. All in all the game is more than worth a try. Great graphics fun game mechanics and good diversity in classes, and daily rewards for playing make you want to play it everyday. I've seen reviews bashing the fps style of play, but I enjoy the change I feel more in control of my character. The fps style action is different, but honestly makes the game better and stand out against its competitors. If you are a fan of 3rd person shooters you can definitely get into this game. It might be a little slow paced compared to a 3rd person shooter, but for a mmo with this style of gameplay it's fairly fast paced. I can easily spend an entire day questing or grinding, and still feel like the combat is fresh and innovative. Tera breathes new life into the mmo genre and I honestly hope other developers follow the example set and make some more interesting mmos with this style of play. I have nothing against the traditional style of mmo(hardcore WoW fan), but Tera has blown me away. Give this game a try you will not be disappointed, unless you hate having fun. What are you waiting on download it, it's free! 10 out of 10","May 18, 2015","true","320.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

There are a few things that bugged me , like there is no exp bar so i have no idea how close i am to the next level also when you have a quest to kill some boss the other players spawn kill it so you cant kill the boss to complete the quest, aslo some of the classes were super OP in my opinion , the beserker class was pertty fun to use but was pretty easy to kill high trier mobs with certain abilities, the gunner a fiarly new class is also pretty OP as i can Spawn kill bosses with it and get LOADS of exp and level up super quick. The majority of the mobs were pretty easy to kill espesialy with the beserker class , as you can knock your enemies down and spamm them with your huge axe, not sure about the other classes as i ahvent played them , but I would think they are aslo pretty powerfull in there own ways.To get some of the good loot you have to be a higher level so it just sits there in your inventory and have to gind away to get it, which is expected from any mmo. The bosses (If u can kill it before the gunnrers) are pretty easy and go down pretty quickly at the start of the game, im hoping that it gets tougher as I progress though Tera . some things that i think should be added are custom dungeons as in made fans/players, custom/workshop weapons would be pretty cool too , and custom quests or bosses. All round pretty good game , if your not into mmo's or are you should definetly give Tera a try. 10/10 in my book atleast.","May 6, 2015","true","9.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

I will continue to do so till another MMO offers a playstyle similar to TERA or even better. The next best thing about TERA is the fact that its pay for convience since I dispise P2W.

I find that I like the controls better with the keyboard and mouse, but if you aren't interested in hardcore play styles the game is perfectly playable with a controller.\n\nGraphically this game is beautiful, no complaints there.\n\nGameplay: Aiming matters. In this game all of your spells/attacks have to be aimed. The only other MMORPG I have ever played was world of warcraft, so this is a novel mechanic for me. I think it makes fur a fun new combat style. Aside from that, the game itself follows the standard kill x, gather y, ect to finish quests and level up.\n\npros: Free, controller support, unique combat style\n\ncons: Questing gets repetitive and boring\n\nAll in all this game is worth trying out  8/10\n\n\n","May 26, 2015","true","22.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

No fancy weapons that can one-shot people in pvp, and no armor that turns you into a god.  You can work and craft your way up and not put a single penny into this game.  Or you can farm gold and buy what you want in the broker.  Whichever your cup of tea is.  In order to be the big dog on campus, you need to combine both your physical attributes and your actual personal skills in learning and playing your class.  There isn't just one correct way, but there are many wrong ways.\n\nAwesome combat style, overly-sexualized armor, and weapons 3 times bigger than your character, what is not to love?!\n\nIf you're into MMOs, I most certainly recommend this game be added to your collection!","May 6, 2015","true","97.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

This was my person experience . If you do make it through all the way i salute you!\n\nThe items you get when you first start are nice. I started mine on a celebration weekend so it may be different for others. I was given some exp potions and a starter mount upon logging in, Nice right? Well little did i know it was for the first character you started with and that character only. So if you logged in and used the mount it was for that character only. Most mounts are character only from what i found out. So be careful which character you use that mount on.\n\n-The community-\nThe community is the worst i have seen in any ♥♥♥♥♥♥me i have played. I met two nice people in the 136 hours i played. Yes you get those people in any game but because of the Elin character which looks like a little girl the chat is filled with people that call themselves pedo's and talk about anything sexually related to that topic. Or just sex in general.\n\n-Dungeons-\nif you dont know what your doing in dungeons forget it. No one wil help. If the group dies it will disband and you will be stuck trying to figure out how to get back in. You get teleported to the nearest town and need to buy scrolls from a speciality vendor. You wont know that if no one tells you and there expensive when you first start playing. I find having to buy scrolls to get back a horrible way to get back to the instance. I personally love going into new dungeons and trying to figure the bosses and layout of the dungeon. Well All through the game, even at higher level dungeons people do whatever they want. As a healer/tank you will have a horrible time going through these as people generally just start running the second they get into the dungeon and everyone runs different ways killing whatever they see.\n\n-Raiding/Endgame-\nIf you are looking to play this game for end content or looking to raid then dont come to this game. There is no raiding or end content. You go into dungeons to get gear so you can go to other high level dungeons to get gear. That is the norm. But those higher level dungeons drop the same gear as the lower except one or two pieces. Of course you need to know the fights to get into the bigger dungeons but if you dont know them you generally will get kicked and not be given a chance. You would think you could look up the fights right? Check the next problem.\n\n-Information about the game-\nTera also has the least amount of information i have ever seen on any game as well. Any website i go to has little to no information about fights/gear/where to get this/how to get that. You mine as well just go until you figure it out and if you cant then oh well. The chat will not help.\n\n-Players-\nGriefing. Nothing worse than someone following you around griefing. I got people all the time constantly trying to duel me. When someone duels you, anything you are doing, looking at the auction house or gear. It will take you out of that and ask if you want to duel. You can click no but they will continue to bombared you with duel invites. As far as i could see i could not find any option to turn dueling off or trading. So i had to deal with that all through my adventures through tera.\n\n-Surviving-\nThere is really no way to get Hp up in this game after a fight. You have to stand there wait. yes you can have bandages and potions but if you are say at 5% hp and use both you might get to 50% hp. Then you have to wait another minute before using them again. Certainly not a efficient way to get your hp up.\n\n-Leveling-\nIf you are wanting to be a healer or tank in this game then wait till you hit max level. It is quite horrible to try to level up as a tank or healer. Takes to long to kill anything and as a tank you have no heals so you go back to the problem i had above this one.\n\n-Questing-\nQuesting in this game is pretty useless. Dungeons are way faster way to level up. You also get story questlines and as long as you follow the story quests and do dungeons in between you wont have to do any other quests. Though alot of the questline is annoying to get through with mazes.\n\n-Character creation-\nThe character creation is ok. They certainly make the men look like a woman and the women never have anything on.\nThey have hitboxes for all the different characters. The woman have smaller hitboxes so your almost forced to play a woman just to make it easier.\n\n-Powerleveling-\nYou cannot powerlevel in this game. Was going to help some friends level becuase they wanted to play. You get little to no xp in dungeons if you are running them through and no gear drops. They get no xp for mobs if your in a group. If you are not in a group and you help kill they do not get the kill for it so they get no exp. I really hate that they try to get rid of powerleveling.\n\n-Addons/mods-\nIf you are looking for mods or addons for this game there are none. They feel that it is unfair to others Which is not true. If there are mods out there anyone can use those mods. They also do not approve of you using any addons outside the game like dps meters. If you are caught with that it is a ban.\n\n-support-\nNot a suprise, the support is bad. Everyone that had harrased me or that was horrible in the game i reported. As usual it does no good. I even put in tickets on questions i had because i could not find them anywhere else. I never got any response back. So if you need help from them You are out of luck.\n\n\n-fighting/combat-\nThe combat in this game is really good. I found it very enjoyable that you have to be active in fighting. You cannot sit back and press a couple buttons. There are things to avoid and dodge and counter attack. You get really into it. It was probably the most enjoyable part of this game.\n\nThere are more bad/good things about this game but this review is already so long lol. I enjoyed this game in the beginning and got through all the horrible annoyances/bugs/people but once i found out that there was no endgame i stopped playing. I really really wish there was because the game itself looked so fantastic.\n\n\n","September 8, 2015","false","136.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","2"

This is especially true for me as I cannot even do 'dailies' without getting terminally bored, and I'm not a fan of all the jumping about in shooters either! I much prefer a more social 'hang out with everyone on TS and raid' environment.\n\nThat and Asian games always lose something in translation to a more Western audience - and typically that something is the story.\n\nBut now we have rolled the clock forward a few years and Tera has become available on Steam for the low, low price of 'free'. So having nothing to lose I installed it... And it is actually, surprisingly, fun!\n\nThe overall combat pacing is far more involved than, say, WoW - but it is still sedate enough one can play 'for fun' without needing to invest their life in identifying attack tells to the point they are muscle memory just to survive...\n\nLocalization-wise Enmasse has done a truly wonderful job of westernizing the game world, and have managed to inject a lot of western humor into it while maintaining the general feel of the setting. It still looks Asian in the various motifs and design elements, but it is not jarring to the western eye. And the voice acting to supplant the original audio is really spot-on.\n\nAchieving this is truly a lot harder than it sounds, and Enmasse really deserves some kudos for how well they have pulled off the localization of Tera.\n\nGraphically Tera is based on the Unreal Engine, so it is suitably shiny in all the right places and the environments are lush and immersive. And the various races all have a distinct visual flavor that makes them feel quite unique as well.\n\nOverall though, I'm having a ball with the game and have levelled a Priest to 30 and an Archer to 20-something, and I think I'm ready to go ahead and pony up for the subscription. :)","May 11, 2015","true","59.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

As you may have already read, "sex sells" in TERA. During my five hours of gameplay, EVERY woman I saw was at least somewhat youthful, busty, and midriff-bearing, save for a grandmother chatting with her grandson.\nI understand that sexualization is actually okay, for it is simply an appealing factor to anyone whom is sexually attracted to the female human body, but TERA "sells sex" blatantly; you can purchase lingerie (weird sexual underwear) for your female character, and of course short, skimpy maid outfits and the like. I also saw in the TERA Community section that one can also purchase larger breasts for their female character. In my opinon, being able to walk around in underwear was already too far, but having nearly every single outfit for female characters being sexual (and the female models being already smooth, swaying hourglasses) is, still in my opinon, nearly abhorable.\nI should emphasize that I'm expressing my opinion, but I also count this as a warning, I guess, to those who find the aforementioned shallow marketing as something that would upset them.","March 5","false","5.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArcticaRises/recommended/323370/","ArcticaRises","Arctica","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArcticaRises/","59 products in account","Tera is a must try for MMO fans, or anyone familiar with the action/rpg genre willing to experiment with the Massively Multiplayer Online format. Look to Tera for fast action, engaging player progression, and stunning visuals. Not quite what you were looking for? Feel free to check out any of my other reviews and see if you find something that suites you better! Now, on to the review.\n\nStill here? Fantastic. The rest of this review will be dedicated to a breakdown of Tera's positive and negative elements. I'll end with a few words on what makes this game worthy of your time, as well as a number score to refer to. Let's Jump right in with:\n\nWhy Tera stands appart from the competition:\n\n-The Combat. This is the point you'll hear brought up the most often, and it is a significant one. Instead of the point-and-click adventure style gameplay of most MMORPG's, Tera prefers a more third person action perspective. Basically, your character movements feel responsive and quick, most monster and players have abilities that can be dodged by moving, and your own skills are manually aimed. This adds a deep skill element to the combat, and it feels great to know that combat isn't simply a matter of who has the higher ability or gear scores.\n\n-The Character Design. This category is a bit of a double-edged sword, as Tera's anime-esq graphical and character design may be a turn off to some players. I had some reservations over this design choice going in, but was immediatly blown away by just how beautifully stylized everything looked. I feel that recently, MMORPG's have opted towards a sort of "muddy" or gritty look with their character design. I found Tera's bright, over the top, and addmittedly a bit sexed up player models to be nothing but refreshing and enjoyable.\n\n-The Environments. Every area and dungeon in this game felt destinctive and thriving with life. Some of the more tropical areas in the game are truly a joy to explore.\n\n-The RPG Elements. Each character automatically learns all their abilities as they level up, negating that feeling of horrible indecision about which skill to take when all, or perhaps none, look attractive. In addition, every skill learned felt like it fit just right into the character's build, whether it be that of a tanky fighter or a long ranged damage dealer.\n\n-The Rewards. Tera has a way of rewarding the player as they move through the game, with new pieces of gear constantly changing the character appearence for the better. In a game full of over the top, bad ♥♥♥ looking players, it's very rewarding to feel like you're constantly moving towards that, whether you've never spent a cent or have invested a fortune.\n\n-The PvP and Dungeoning. Each dungeon feels like an intimate experience, with a small group of players hacking and slashing their way through hordes of specific monsters to reach an epic final fight with a huge, well just about anything (I could swear my buddies and I beat up the Balrog from Lord Of the Rings...) PvP falls into a similair category, but scaled up a hundred times. About 20 hours into the game you'll be given the option to que up for raids with random players, simialair to how most modern multiplayer games que up lobbies. However, instead of some small player on player deathmatch, you are immediatly given hugely powerful gear (to level the playing field, no matter the level) and thrown into massive army on army seiges. One scenario I encountered involved teaming up with over 50 other players to lay seige to an enemy castle, before having the tables turned and being forced to defend a castle of our own.\n\n-The Ease of Use. This game is easy to pick up and understand. Most of the extra-curricular activities are thoroughly explained and crafting/gathering mostly boils down to collecting the right items and pressing F. The built in help menu is a constant friend during early levels.\n\n-The Over-All Game Feel. This is a bit hard to explain, but this game understands what you want. No player wants to have to slog through hundreds of hours of being the "noob" or new player. No player wants to be the weakest or the least powerful. Tera understands that. Tera is here to help. Every element is tailored to immerse you and make you feel like a genuine, all powerful bad-♥♥♥ from the moment you accept your first quest to the final level cap.\n\nAs you can probably tell, I enjoy Tera quite a bit. However, I will be the first to admit its flaws. My qualm with Tera mostly falls into one major category: Restriction.\n\nNot sure what I mean by "Restriction?" Basically, throughout the game Tera takes away much of the freedom you'd expect from an MMORPG. This is why:\n\n-The Questing and Progression. As wonderful as it is to tour Tera's gourgeous environments, that's just what it feels like; A tour. "And here we have the massive tree of life. On your left you can see the evil goblins. Please be sure to visit our giftshop on the way out. NO TOUCHING!" Quests sheppard you from one checkpoint to the next, killing and looting as you go. In addition, there are invisible walls that block you from moving much farther then is approved questing ground. Being put in such a thriving and vibrant environment and not being able to fully explore it felt disappointing. I expected more freedom to enjoy the world I was given.\n\n-The Progression. As much as I was praising Tera for taking away the anguish behind selectively picking each skill, I would have liked to see a bit more character customization. Even the initial character customization screen feels a bit lack luster (I do appreciate the 30 different colors of hair, dont get me wrong.) I expected more freedom to make my character my own.\n\n-The Grinding. Now please, don't get me wrong, Tera does everything it can to sugar coat grinding, or repetative questing. Pulling of combos is easy and satisfying, and monster deaths that literally shower loot in every direction feel rewarding. Although grinding is an integral part of most MMORPGs, or just plain RPGs for that matter, I feel the need to point out this fact: most questing boils down to pressing F on one group of NPC's, completing generic tasks, then moving to the next group of F hungry NPCs. I expected more freedom in how I approached leveling and growing as a player.\n\nI appreciate Tera because it recognizes its flaws and succeeds in masking them. Every area is absolute eye candy that you'd happily walk through. Every skill is flashy, well animated, and just a joy to use, so you always feel excited for each new power you gain. More often then not you'll go out of your way to kill more monsters then required, simply because it's fun to watch your (awesome looking) character smash their way through hoards of enemies like some sort of sword/staff/gun weilding Incredible Hulk. Tera has very few slow moments, and I always leave the game eager to come back and experience more of this fantastical, beautiful, chaotic world.\n\nTera is an experience not to be missed out on. Although this game was free, I would have payed full price for this hectic collection of stylized action.\n\n8.75/10\n\nEnjoyed the review? Have a different opinion?

As a F2P player base, the community is toxic to no end. You MAy get lucky and find adecent group worth latching on to for static runs, but by and large people are at their worst in this game, especially in PvP.\n\nNext, the Cash shop, though it is used mainly for cosmetic gear and not game breaking "P2W" crap, is still a massive trap. You either settle for an inferior yet still expensive item such as an outfit or mount or weapon skin, or you pay anywhere from 5 to 100 dollars to GAMBLE at a chance of getting the better looking cosmetic items... then gamble some more for the rest of the items you want.\n\nThird, the insane level of immersion breaking fluff content just kills the game, at least for me. You start off being introduced to a decently rich fantasy world with some elements of a technologically advanced alien race invading this fantasy world only to come across.... 10 year old girl characters dressed in lingerie driving around cars? It's not just immersion breaking, on some levels it is just wrong.\n\nFinally, the lolicon element... while I am in support of fan "tasteful" fanservice, to me it is questionable that the creators of the game handwave away massive lolicon pandering by claiming this oversexualized preteen playable race are "immortal tree spirits that are all female". The premise is fine except you can dress them up in extremely suggestive outfits, and the more adult female characters are even less immune to the hypersexualization present in the game. There's a fine border between fanservice and softcore porn, and this game has trouble knowing which side it is on.\n\nAlso, as a side note the game is incredibly poorly optimized. Even high end computers may struggle at some points in the game, and in pvp battlegrounds especially, it is reccomended you just turn graphics down to avoid FPS dips at critical moments of battle. While the game may be beautiful, the beauty can come at the price of random dips to 15-20 FPS even on a machine running a GTX 970 with an 8 core CPU and 16 GB of ram.\n\n\nEven with the fantastic way combat is handled in this game, the negative aspects are just too much to ignore, especially upon reaching the endgame. The amazing combat and non target system can suck you in very easily, but the end game grind and (depending on your tastes) the massive amount of immersion breaking cash shop content can easily rip you out of the enjoyment if the random FPS dips don't do it first.","January 31","false","0.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

(thankfully one can simply ignore these after lvl 20)\n- GUNNER OVERFLOW: Ya can't really blame the game on this one, but everyone and i mean EVERYONE plays the new DPS class, making it take longer for the beforementioned matchmaker to acctually get a good group going.\n- Slow start: Start is rather slow once you realise all the acctual game that happens after lvl 20\n\ntldr;\nI'm enoying this quite alot.","May 9, 2015","true","48.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JD_Mortal/recommended/323370/","JD_Mortal","JD_Mortal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JD_Mortal/","27 products in account","Spent a few hours playing this game. 113, so far, and counting... This is not a "hasty review".\n\nOver-all, the game is a GREAT time-killer and well worth the play. (Most casual gamers can stop reading here.)\n\nNOTE: Get a 400-button mouse and chameleon-eyes to fully enjoy playing this game.\n\nThe game seems like it is being "reinvented" at the moment. It is changing from a goofy "story-mode" game, into a "novelty-play" game. The story was actually horrible, in a funny and goofy way, as if created by kids and programmers who have no idea what a story actually is, but had the power to create a great game.\n\nHowever, now the game is turning into a novelty-play game like "anarchy-online". Most things don't make sense in the world, added for fun, not for immersion of reality. Thus, breaking away from the story. (That is a good thing, but the story still exists. I imagine soon it will be removed too.)\n\nThe only "flaws", I see in the game, are the following...\n\n- Story-line makes no sense at all. (Island came out of nowhere, just before you arrive, yet has a multi-thousand-year "history" ?!?)\n\n- You "collide" with many things which you shouldn't, or should but they are in horrible locations that impede playing.\n\n- "look to aim" is a horrible setup, not a "new idea", that was abandoned because "it sucks". This game embraces the suck... Then demands that you also somehow attempt to maneuver, and watch cool-downs, and avoid terrain you can't see, and observe horribly split-up GUI elements. (Demands, as in, failing to watch gets you killed, often.)\n\n- Keys are buggy for input... (Goes with the look to aim issue.) You find yourself hitting keys multiple times, just to make them to work... then, hitting them twice often cancels things, so you end-up trying to make it work, then canceling it, once it works... leading to "undesired results", which impede the gameplay. (Leading to death often.)\n\n- Broken guidance to quests. (Many things it "assumes" you know. Like where "bob" is located. Not showing you where he is, on occasions.)\n\n- Over-done "visual blocking obstructions", where none are needed... Makes you have to walk around tons of walls to get around to the other side, everywhere... What should have been a direct 2-second walk, turns into a 1-minute journey. (That is over-exaggerated, but not far from the reality.) This includes the "outside world", which often seems like you are just running through bumpy hallways, not outside, other than seeing an over-populated sky you can't reach.\n\n- Nothing to do, once you have seen the whole world. It is not that large... Only thing left after hitting the level-cap, is PvP, which this game is not good for. (You collide with players on your screen, but on the server, they are not in that spot, thus, when you attack there, the server throws-out your hits, as there was no-one there on the server. They were 4-feet away from that spot. (That is why the whole "point to aim" system is often abandoned, or nerfed, or cheated. No-one has figured-out how to time-slip program yet. Well, they haven't.)\n\n- Lots of junk everywhere and a poor item-management setup. (That includes the auction-house and inventory system.) You can sell things that are "needed" on your character. {You can have multiple OUTFITS, but the "required items" do not "lock", thus, you can accidentally sell something another profile needs, and you end-up naked in battle when switching to that profile.. thus... death...} The rest of the stuff is just poorly sorted or isolated or grouped, and hard to identify, what should be easy to identify within the clutter... (Scrolls should all be together and consume fractions of slots not whole slots each, gems should all fit into one bag, not individual slots. Yet these things stack by the thousands... But if you have ten different ones, that is ten slots... but ten of the same, is a simple stack of ten in one slot?!?!?)\n\n- People have "labels" who do not need labels... and add confusion... (People labeled [Merchant], some are actual stores, others are just dummy NPC's that do not function as anything, but both say [Merchant], or [Banker], or stupid things like [Guard], [Friendly guy], [Sled maker]... etc... which is not worth identifying... making it hard to locate actual people needed, visually. The floating names and markers are also sometimes airborne and totally out of view. Some not showing until you are close enough to kiss the NPC, which often leads to death...)\n\nAll the above are mostly just annoyances, after having played for 100+ hours. They can all be lived-with, and most avoided, without "killing the game", but it may "kill your character" a few times...\n\nThis is still fun to play... Play it until it becomes a cluster-F like "Anarchy-online", then move-on to the next "new old-thing".","May 23, 2015","true","294.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Honestly, that's what first grabbed my attention for the game. I also like that the game is just as easy to play solo as it is with others. I enjoyed the combat system, think the UI is pretty efficient, and liked the crafting system. The characters and quests have a bit more thought put into them than your typical MMO, and that's pretty cool to. It's also fairly easy to get started in the game, and you can jump into it quickly, or take your time and look around. I also liked that, while you can certainly pay to get some pretty cool extras, I never felt like it was a pay-to-win game (that said, I have not played the PvP aspect of the game).\n\nThen the cons:\nThere were only a few things I didn't like in this game. The partying system is not friendly to players who are new to MMOs. I had a friend play with me, and, when I wasn't there, they had to google how to get some things done just to basic stuff in chat. You also can't tell what channel someone is on, even if they're in your party, although this can be worked around with a bit of communication. The game is also not very accommodating for people with disabilities. You can read more than a few threads on En Masse's website where people are asking for things as simple as a colorblind option, but they haven't been implemented into the game yet. There are also a few points where the physics breaks in the game or the world just disappears (but to be honest, most of them were when I spent 15min climbing that really tall mountain off in the distance that there was really no point to). There are also some repeatable quests in the game, and I didn't like that they would stay on your quest tracker hogging up space, and the only way to get rid of them is to permantly decline the quest. While these were minor issues for me, none of them ever got in my way of enjoying the game.\n\nWhy I'm not playing anymore:\nWhat did get in my way of enjoying the game was the community. The chat in the game is set up in different categories (global, trade, party, etc.), but many people will use the chats interchangibly. While a minor inconvience, this isn't particularly an issue in-and-of itself. What is a problem is what ends up flooding the chat. It often feels like the chat is 85-90% composed of children just hitting puberty and discovering the internet for the first time. Vulgar texts, insults, sexual solicitations, and more flood almost every chat channel almost constantly, even occassionaly (but more often than you'd think) straying into threats of various abuses. The community's solution appears to be ignore this, but it's difficult when you have to ignore a little less than a quarter of your screen. You could also mute those players, but there are so many, it would be an unending process. It also makes it difficult to find parties to play with when soloing because players halfway expect you to be a jerk and will just ignore you. and the game's partying system is also flooded with these conversations, so it's almost impossible to find a party when you're under level 60.\n\nDealing with the community (and by dealing with, I mean putting up with their juvenile behavior while trying to ignore it) ended up sucking the fun out of the game for me. After a witnessing two individuals have a particularly vulgar conversation that lasted for over an hour, I found myself considering uninstalling the game. Personally, I have a policy that, if a game ever makes you think about uninstalling it, you should just do it. It's just a game, and there are others like it out there. Nothing is lost by walking away, so my quest for a good, immservise MMO will continue.\n\nTL;DR: Game 7.5-8/10, but the community sucks and you sometimes want to uninstall.","June 20, 2015","true","66.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics to me are amazing for an mmo as well. Such detail is put into a lot of things, including your character's gear. Whenever you equip an item you notice everytime how it effects your characters appearance. It's also not a pay to win game. Very quick to queue for dungeons if you're a healer ;).\n\nBad things:\nThe game is ridiculously UNBALANCED. Gunner is pretty much the best class in whatever they do, and are the greatest dpsers. But because of that, some classes that could be so great are not worth playing because of the Reapers and Gunners just existing within the game. The game needs to nerf their overpowered classes. Also, the game has a very cluttered screen and the map and compass are not efficient. The map isn't to scale really, and it's not clear what you're doing or where to go for your quests. Just a very cluttered HUD in general that can be distracting, or makes you miss important announcements within the game or server. Crafting is pretty slow. You get stuck in the game a lot on stairs or other players, or on stuff that isn't even there causing you to jump tons of times to try to get to where you're going. Also when you do a quest that says it's for your level it lies because the quests don't actually really scale to your level. Dungeons can be unpleasant if you are stuck with people who don't know what they're doing; recommend to play it with friends.\n\n\nIf you get through the bad things this game is worth playing in my opinion.","November 9, 2015","true","62.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I find it fun for both solo and group play, although soloing BAMs and Dungeons is definitely a challenge. There are certain things I dislike about the game as well, specifically the sexualized female characters (other than the Elin, although the community has sexualized them as well...), other than that, the story line is adequate, the amount of races and classes are nice, although I would like if some of the classes weren't gender or race specific.\n\nNow for the heart of what I love about this game!\n-Graphics - the graphics quality is amazing, and is the first thing that drew me to try Tera.\n-Difficulty - being able to switch between different classes to try them out was pretty nice, I mean you had to recreate the character into a new class, but it was easy to do so if you wanted to swap. I lucked out with my love for the Archer class, it's a difficult class for solo play, but it has definitely improved my battle strategy for solo play. Such as watching other players in the world fight the BAMs to learn BAM attacks and strategize when I need to use my two main escapes in order to avoid damage. The archer class is pretty easy to learn, but it takes time to master, as you have so many combos and skills that you can switch around per enemy, certain skills are good for a quick getaway, others simply for hard damage output, etc. Soloing with this class is amazingly fun to me, but difficult and frustrating at times. On a team, the archer class, depending on the build, can be a "I stand here and shoot constantly" type of play or a "I juggle aggro with other teammates and use my escapes to position close to the enemy for certain skills and far from the enemy for others"\n-With any class, you need to know your skills, you need to understand how they can combo, what distance they do the most damage from, how to position yourself to do the most damage, etc.\n-You don't have to spend money to win the game, all purchases are cosmetic, or they make you cover ground faster (in terms of mounts). It's fun to play free.\n-PvE is amazing, it isn't just grinding, it isn't just storyline, there is a bit of both, plus achievements that make the goal-oriented like me have fun while I proceed.\n\nOverall, I love this game.","January 29","true","201.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've had a really bad experience with long grinds for one simple level up, impossible to reach end games, and terrible/dead communities.\nTera is an amazing game I'd definitely recommend, even though it has its cons - like any game.\n\n\n\nPros:\n- Little to no grinding.\nThe hardest time I've ever had leveling was from 58 to 60, and that only took me a few days of casual play - maybe 30 min to an hour a day for 3 or 4 days.\n- Great combat.\nI hate point-&-click combat. Way too boring, and gear oriented. With an open combat system it requires skill, so that guy who spent $1000 to max absolutely everything out won't be able to kill you unless he puts time into learning how to play. So at the end of the day it doesn't come down to who can mash buttons the fastest.\n- Awesome PvE.\nInstance matching, hard dungeons, easy dungeons, solo dungeons, dungeons that require skill. It's all there.\n- Awesome PvP.\nI cannot get enough of Corsairs' Stronghold (a 20 v 20 Battleground in which defenders attempt to repel the enemy offensive).\n- Fun early game.\nWhen I first went through the game with my brother we had a blast. He chose a tank, and I chose a healer. We'd fight BAMs, do quests, and run dugeons, and we got from level 1 to level 40+ in 1 weekend.\n\n\nNow here comes the cons:\n- Elins.\nLittle girls in skimpy outfits. This doesn't need to exist.\n- Popori\nFat little animal guys. They're all guys. They're all fat. They all look dumb.\nThe only redeeming quality they have is that I once saw a dog popori names barf. Tosher.\n- Pedophiles.\nI recall one morning logging on, execting another fun day playing Tera. Then I look in my chat, and read "the elins thighs are so yummy!" I couldn't bring myself to play Tera for the rest of that day...\n- Weeaboos... they're everywhere!\nHonestly, you kinda have to go looking for them, or just happen to unluckily stumble upon them, but the consetration is definitely a bit higher in this game.\n- The community can be garbadge sometimes.\nThere are a lot of toxic people in this game's community, which is unsurprizing since they're also likely potential pedophiles.\n- Everything is sexualized.\nCan the gaming community as a whole get a break from this, please? I know I'm not the first person to come out and declair how tired I am of this crap. I just wanna play a video game. Can I not get pixelated boobs in my face?\n\nA few of those cons can be overlooked, but they still exist in the game. My personal endeavor is to become a great PvPer, start a guild of my own, and ban all Elins and maybe some Popori from joining. Until that day I suppose I just have to deal with them...","July 24, 2015","true","692.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It's game-play is responsive and satisfying but suffers from a dated quest system and lacklustre storyline. Graphically, it still looks great despite only being powered by a modified Unreal 3 engine. There will be pop-ins, textures not loading until you are right next to them, and short view-distance. Their cash-store is loaded with costumes tailored to every kind of closet otaku out there (Yes, we are legion =-D). I'm ashamed to say I'm quite the whale for this game; to the magnitude of hundreds of CAD. Overall, this game is still one of my favorite games to come back to from time to time. Take my assessment with a grain of salt as I have invested heavily in it all the way from when it was released as a p2p game.\n\nHere's a highlight of some of the enjoyable combat you will enjoy early on.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QJrSXy-RfU","May 17, 2015","true","113.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was a bit too grindy when it was first released which killed off most of the casual audience - including myself.\n\nThe new gunner class and release on steam seems to have revived it - the new dungeon finder works great so you can skip questing entirely and just queue dungeons to level.\n\nThe main fun starts at level 65 dungeons are challenging but still fun.  Gear progression is there and there are hard modes once you've conquered the normal dungeons.\n\nThe community can be somewhat elitist but once you break in you'll understand why - still there's lot of nice people to help you.\n\nHighly reccomend this game I'm having a lot more fun this time around.","June 19, 2015","true","233.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The begining part of the game is a lot of fun, and it has good pacing. Now, a thing that is bad in my opinion is the character generator. It seems really lacking compared to other generators that I have seen (except for Destiny's). And it feels like there is no reason to play as a male character in the game, because multiple classes are for female characters only, like the brawler.\n\nLike other games, I'm now addicted to Tera.

That said, pay content is really one sided, playing as a male character you don't have nearly as many customizations as the females and the down side of being a female is the armour sets, even playing a tank class, you're not going to get a badass armour, you're getting a piece of cloth that barely covers your ~not that private~ areas.\nTera tends to break the immersion of the game a lot with mounts like the cars, just like Cabal Online with futuristic bikes and surfboards, this IS a problem, even if people like it, i mean, c'mom people.\nAt higher levels you start to see design lazyness when it comes to sets, all sets looks the same, so you are "compeled" to buy EMP and get something different.","July 27, 2015","true","411.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So you only should play healer if your friend won't mind helping you all the time on quests, or if you don't mind spending 10x the time it tooks to a DPS to kill a mob as healer\n\n- This game has lots of bugs all over it, you will probably have to face a few that will make you have to restart the game.\n- The new dungeon's bosses are totally copy and paste with a few new mechanics....\n- If you are into crafting/alchemy prepare for the MASSIVE GRIND that it is to level your crafting levels.\n- The late game alliance points system is good but it is a little bit too easy for trolling...\n- If you're not into side quests, 90% of your time on the game will be just walking around, the main quests usually just make you travel the areas so you can get the side quests.\n\n\nTL;DR: Good game (with the exception of healer players), its grindy and there is some annoying bugs, but its all worth it","September 9, 2015","true","410.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But if you look past the cultural block, the game is actually really frickin good, for a F2P. You can get max level and gear without spending a single dime. In fact, all the money i've spent, has gone all towards cosmetics. It's combat and art are top notch.

Granted there are better but for a free to play MMO thats about 2 years old, this is amazing,\n\n- The Gameplay/Combat : To be honest this is like the 70% of the reason why I play this game. It's just awesome. Very well executed true-action combat with great visuals on skills and animations.\n\n- Costuming : Being a Korean MMO, if there's one thing they can never do wrong is costuming. Lots of flashy, sexy ..perverted *cough* and downright epic looking costumes and weapon skins. Some are free but most of them are paid. Understandable since they're just skins.\n\n- Dungeons : There's a lot of dungeons for you to play... but i'll get into it later.\n\n- Teamwork : There are dungeons where if one person fails, we all fail, requires true teamwork so great if you have a group of friends and teamspeak.\n\n- Consumables : Unlike other games where buffs and damage boosters are optional, in TERA, they are downright awesome and you can see a SIGNIFICANT difference in damage and healing with/without using cosumables.\n\n\nAlright so those are the six things I LOVED, now let's go to what I DON't LIKE:\n\n- Yet another grindy MMO : Granted thats how MMOs are supposed to be, i still feel that they could've made it less grindy, especially for early levels. At 65 all you'll be doing is one dungeon 90% of your first days as max level to get your gear, or grinding BAM quests repeatdly.... and logging in NEXUS times to fight ur ♥♥♥ off to get that 900- 1.2k gold.\n\n-P2W ?: ... not really but.., this is a tough one, and i might get a LOT of downvotes for this but i gotta be honest, i felt like it wasn't Pay to win either, but let's calculate EMP right now is atleast 12 gold , and if you downright spend 100$ which will gave u about 120k gold, You will be able to get your Schisma set all +12 ( which is like the decent standard for good parties to take you in) . Granted you can still make that but just a lot slower, and to be honest it doesn't really effect PVP. i should say it's more of Pay to Look Cool and Pay for Convinence.\n\n- Game can become a routine : I played TERA 8 hours a day, along with dumping 60$ on the steam pack in order to get where i am which is +12 schisma gear. Sooner rather than later, you might * note i said might because if you joined a nice guild and made some really good friends you may be playing tera for the social aspect, in my case i didn't and i wasn't so the game becomes like a chore that i went through day by day.\n\nMy Overall rating for this game is 8.5/10 a great MMO thats worth your time and money, if you decide to spend.\n\n\nTL: DR - Better than GW2 while being Free to Play. I  recommend this to any MMO, anime, action combat, cute characters, pantsu lover ... and pervs.","September 29, 2015","true","211.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Basically the game is very decent, and plays farily well. It's sort of a mix between wow and vindictus, with the real time combat and what not. It comes with a dodge mechanic you don't think you need...until you need it. Also the Popori are ♥♥♥♥ing adorable, and Once I saw that races became null and void. Take the time and try it out, if you don't like it, you don't have to keep it. Also a word on pay-to-win. I didn't see much of that, then again I wasn't looking for it either. From what I found so far the game is very well balanced and fun to play, either on your own or with a friend, though I'd strongly reccomend playing it with a freind.\n\nYou can also make a guild. We made one called kitty cat crusaders. Had to find an icon for the guild. Found it when we found the knight cat declaring "GOD WILLS IT." I have no regrets. Try it!

I played this game before it came to steam and cannot hide the awesome times i have had playing this master piece. It has great music that fits every moment, nice visual changes every time you equip new armor sets or weapons so that you don't feel as though you're putting on the same thing, a fun moving combat system (move around while attacking, using skills etc.) and a BIG pool of character creations (I literally spent 20 mins making my charcater). The quests are a bit lack luster having the same concept of the fetching quests or slay an amount of enemies. The menu can also get very confusing for players who are new to the MMORPG genre. I recommend this game to any gamers who want a thrilling and fun game to party up with friends to take on raids or fight in PvP.

The best combat system I have ever seen, you have to be skillful at this game to succeed. Tera is not optimized what so ever, even with a beastly computer that can play Star Citizen's Arena Commander mod on very high graphics with no problems. Tera on most computers will run smooth and then all of a suddenly go from 59fps of smooth gameplay down to a 4 second cycle of 0 fps. To get gear in this game is very difficult without flat out spending real cash to buy EMP items and selling said items in game for gold. This is because there is a cap to how many PvE and PvP points you can earn pre a day/week. I hit the weekly cap within 2 days and have to wait 5 to 4 more days for the weekly reset to earn more. All timegates in this game can be overturned by spending real life cash on this game. This game is very pay to win, so if you can deal with that part of the game it's a very good game, IMHO the best Fantasy Action MMORPG on the market.","June 1, 2015","true","559.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It can be a bit grindy and confusing as far as MMORPGs go, but its definitely alot more interactive and fun to play than WoW, alot less overwhelming and weird as Guild Wars 2.

Granted there are better but for a free to play MMO thats about 2 years old, this is amazing,\n\n- The Gameplay/Combat : To be honest this is like the 70% of the reason why I play this game. It's just awesome. Very well executed true-action combat with great visuals on skills and animations.\n\n- Costuming : Being a Korean MMO, if there's one thing they can never do wrong is costuming. Lots of flashy, sexy ..perverted *cough* and downright epic looking costumes and weapon skins. Some are free but most of them are paid. Understandable since they're just skins.\n\n- Dungeons : There's a lot of dungeons for you to play... but i'll get into it later.\n\n- Teamwork : There are dungeons where if one person fails, we all fail, requires true teamwork so great if you have a group of friends and teamspeak.\n\n- Consumables : Unlike other games where buffs and damage boosters are optional, in TERA, they are downright awesome and you can see a SIGNIFICANT difference in damage and healing with/without using cosumables.\n\n\nAlright so those are the six things I LOVED, now let's go to what I DON't LIKE:\n\n- Yet another grindy MMO : Granted thats how MMOs are supposed to be, i still feel that they could've made it less grindy, especially for early levels. At 65 all you'll be doing is one dungeon 90% of your first days as max level to get your gear, or grinding BAM quests repeatdly.... and logging in NEXUS times to fight ur ♥♥♥ off to get that 900- 1.2k gold.\n\n-P2W ?: ... not really but.., this is a tough one, and i might get a LOT of downvotes for this but i gotta be honest, i felt like it wasn't Pay to win either, but let's calculate EMP right now is atleast 12 gold , and if you downright spend 100$ which will gave u about 120k gold, You will be able to get your Schisma set all +12 ( which is like the decent standard for good parties to take you in) . Granted you can still make that but just a lot slower, and to be honest it doesn't really effect PVP. i should say it's more of Pay to Look Cool and Pay for Convinence.\n\n- Game can become a routine : I played TERA 8 hours a day, along with dumping 60$ on the steam pack in order to get where i am which is +12 schisma gear. Sooner rather than later, you might * note i said might because if you joined a nice guild and made some really good friends you may be playing tera for the social aspect, in my case i didn't and i wasn't so the game becomes like a chore that i went through day by day.\n\nMy Overall rating for this game is 8.5/10 a great MMO thats worth your time and money, if you decide to spend.\n\n\nTL: DR - Better than GW2 while being Free to Play. I  recommend this to any MMO, anime, action combat, cute characters, pantsu lover ... and pervs.","September 29, 2015","true","211.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've sunk more than $200 into this game, and not a moment has passed since I've regreted it. Now Tera admittedly isn't for most people. It looks very Korean, and Elins creep normal people out. But if you look past the cultural block, the game is actually really frickin good, for a F2P. You can get max level and gear without spending a single dime. In fact, all the money i've spent, has gone all towards cosmetics. It's combat and art are top notch. It's story line though.........don't bother..............If you're looking for a game to sink a lot time to, watch some Gameplay on Youtube, and come over to Celestial Hills!","September 29, 2015","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You don't really have to pay for anything, and although leveling up is a much easier affair with a subscription, a free to play player can still pose a threat to those who have been playing for a long time. It doesn't show much bias toward subscription players, and there are a lot of opportunities to get things like mounts and other "rare" items in the game. The combat actually requires you to aim and not auto-attack, so it's a nice refreshing approach in terms of combat. Graphics wise, it is really impressive for an MMO. Just be sure that your computer can handle it because TERA can be really intense graphically with the boss fights and whatnot. There are also several classes to choose from (Slayer, Mystic, Priest, Warrior, Berserker, Reaper, etc.) which should provide some unique perspectives for everyone if you want a lot of options when it pertains to picking a class. If you want a fun, free-to-play MMO on Steam, Tera is definitely a great choice.","June 11, 2015","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well, the combat is very good, super fast paced and no spam rotations BS. fights are much more engaging than i am used to in an MMO. I have enjoyed leveling alot more than i am used to in an MMO, not to say the story is good, frankly i have no idea what the story is all about. The quest pace and variance is great though. paired with a good LFG system i and glad to be leveling it doesnt feel like a chore.\n\nNow, the gunner class. what a OP as hell class. Never have i played such a class in an MMO before. I havent died once yet and am level 42. It also feels so powerful. this class along with the action combat is just a joy to play.

This also applies to the enemies' attacks, so to help with this, you have the ability to dodge roll, teleport, or block, depending on your class. In the end, it actually plays more like a third person action game.\n\nAnother thing... It's ACTUALLY free to play.\n\nIt is the best form of a F2P system. You can't pay to win. Buying items is restricted to aesthetics, such as costumes and mounts, as well as convenience items to assist with crafting or traveling. Most of these items are sold by players for game currency anyway, so if you just NEED those items for whatever reason, you can still get them.\n\nThe game also looks pretty good. Of course its not the BEST looking game around, but for an mmo, it does a good job trying to bring the mmo genre into the modern age of graphics.\n\nIf you like any regular MMO, you'll like this more. I completely recommend it.","July 3, 2015","true","240.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Despite being such an old game, it still has the quality you'd expect from a high-quality KMMO made today.\n\nOne of the best aspects of TERA - if not the best aspect - is the incredible Action Combat. Both the community and the developers brag and boast about it's amazing combative system, which is completely justified. It's combat alone ranks it one of the highest-tier MMO you could possible play in the market right and the foreseeable future. It's PvP is intense and very rewarding for the high amount of skill it takes, and the PvE boast a high diversity in bosses, dungeons, and even the general mobs. The new Gunner class is exceptionally well made, and very fun to play.\n\nThe second aspect of TERA that makes it so wonderful is the incredible open world. TERA is a very big game, with a very big world to explore. If you wanted, you could walk from one end of a continent from the other without experiencing a single loading screen to cut off your fun, all the while trying out that incredible combat that becomes incredible diverse later on.\n\nTERA is also a pretty game. It certainly feels like a game from 2014-15, instead of 2011, when it actually came out in Japan, or 2012, when it was released in the United States. The graphics are incredible and if you've got a really good PC, you can really enjoy playing TERA at it's finest. The view from certain areas can be breathtaking, and the best is that it goes on forever for you to explore.\n\nIn this incredible open-world experience, you have a choice from seven different races, all having different traits that help them along their path to greatness. Choose from 10 different classes, which includes the new Gunner class. And when you get to level 65 and are ready to do whatever it is you do, just remember;\n\nElin are your waifus and Global Chat is amazing.","May 7, 2015","true","596.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gameplay\nMost MMORPGS you click on a monster once and you press your skills. In Tera however, you do something completely different and unique; you aim at the monster and preform your attacks manually with a series of left clicks and right clicks. If you trigger a combo move you press space, and hell, its satisfying when you get a combo right on. All of this is done with manual aiming. This makes it VERY unique and fun for ranged classes like Gunner. Next is dodging attacks. In most MMORPGS, you stand still and take the hit, or use some ability to block. In this you have to time dodges or counters, where you character litterally steps out the way of the attack or does a motion to counter the attack, a dodge or counter can also lead to a very satisfying combo.\n2. First Impressions\nThis game nails first impressions. When you first start, you verse giant monsters, your in an interesting quest line that gave me the feels and the monsters have attack makers so you can pull of impressive dodges or counters. After completing this quest you ride a pegusus to the mainland. During the flight the mythical horse flies over the entire starting area, it looks beautiful, ok, then it goes in a gate and then you see the mainland for the first time, from the sky and its BREATHTAKING. On high graphics, it looked so beautiful! At that moment I already fell in love with this game.\n3. Community\nOk, im a weeaboo, at least in the eyes of the internet in general. In Tera, everyones a weeaboo, the community is very fitting for those who love Anime or Japanese Culture. The game itself even knows that since the description of the Elin race is "a waifu" and we can all tell they are Kawaii Lolis too. I think i made more friends in this game than in real life.\n\nAnd this is my first ever legit review. So if i screwed anything over don't be to harsh please.

The best combat system I have ever seen, you have to be skillful at this game to succeed. Tera is not optimized what so ever, even with a beastly computer that can play Star Citizen's Arena Commander mod on very high graphics with no problems. Tera on most computers will run smooth and then all of a suddenly go from 59fps of smooth gameplay down to a 4 second cycle of 0 fps. To get gear in this game is very difficult without flat out spending real cash to buy EMP items and selling said items in game for gold. This is because there is a cap to how many PvE and PvP points you can earn pre a day/week. I hit the weekly cap within 2 days and have to wait 5 to 4 more days for the weekly reset to earn more. All timegates in this game can be overturned by spending real life cash on this game. This game is very pay to win, so if you can deal with that part of the game it's a very good game, IMHO the best Fantasy Action MMORPG on the market.","June 1, 2015","true","559.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JD_Mortal/recommended/323370/","JD_Mortal","JD_Mortal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JD_Mortal/","27 products in account","Spent a few hours playing this game. 113, so far, and counting... This is not a "hasty review".\n\nOver-all, the game is a GREAT time-killer and well worth the play. (Most casual gamers can stop reading here.)\n\nNOTE: Get a 400-button mouse and chameleon-eyes to fully enjoy playing this game.\n\nThe game seems like it is being "reinvented" at the moment. It is changing from a goofy "story-mode" game, into a "novelty-play" game. The story was actually horrible, in a funny and goofy way, as if created by kids and programmers who have no idea what a story actually is, but had the power to create a great game.\n\nHowever, now the game is turning into a novelty-play game like "anarchy-online". Most things don't make sense in the world, added for fun, not for immersion of reality. Thus, breaking away from the story. (That is a good thing, but the story still exists. I imagine soon it will be removed too.)\n\nThe only "flaws", I see in the game, are the following...\n\n- Story-line makes no sense at all. (Island came out of nowhere, just before you arrive, yet has a multi-thousand-year "history" ?!?)\n\n- You "collide" with many things which you shouldn't, or should but they are in horrible locations that impede playing.\n\n- "look to aim" is a horrible setup, not a "new idea", that was abandoned because "it sucks". This game embraces the suck... Then demands that you also somehow attempt to maneuver, and watch cool-downs, and avoid terrain you can't see, and observe horribly split-up GUI elements. (Demands, as in, failing to watch gets you killed, often.)\n\n- Keys are buggy for input... (Goes with the look to aim issue.) You find yourself hitting keys multiple times, just to make them to work... then, hitting them twice often cancels things, so you end-up trying to make it work, then canceling it, once it works... leading to "undesired results", which impede the gameplay. (Leading to death often.)\n\n- Broken guidance to quests. (Many things it "assumes" you know. Like where "bob" is located. Not showing you where he is, on occasions.)\n\n- Over-done "visual blocking obstructions", where none are needed... Makes you have to walk around tons of walls to get around to the other side, everywhere... What should have been a direct 2-second walk, turns into a 1-minute journey. (That is over-exaggerated, but not far from the reality.) This includes the "outside world", which often seems like you are just running through bumpy hallways, not outside, other than seeing an over-populated sky you can't reach.\n\n- Nothing to do, once you have seen the whole world. It is not that large... Only thing left after hitting the level-cap, is PvP, which this game is not good for. (You collide with players on your screen, but on the server, they are not in that spot, thus, when you attack there, the server throws-out your hits, as there was no-one there on the server. They were 4-feet away from that spot. (That is why the whole "point to aim" system is often abandoned, or nerfed, or cheated. No-one has figured-out how to time-slip program yet. Well, they haven't.)\n\n- Lots of junk everywhere and a poor item-management setup. (That includes the auction-house and inventory system.) You can sell things that are "needed" on your character. {You can have multiple OUTFITS, but the "required items" do not "lock", thus, you can accidentally sell something another profile needs, and you end-up naked in battle when switching to that profile.. thus... death...} The rest of the stuff is just poorly sorted or isolated or grouped, and hard to identify, what should be easy to identify within the clutter... (Scrolls should all be together and consume fractions of slots not whole slots each, gems should all fit into one bag, not individual slots. Yet these things stack by the thousands... But if you have ten different ones, that is ten slots... but ten of the same, is a simple stack of ten in one slot?!?!?)\n\n- People have "labels" who do not need labels... and add confusion... (People labeled [Merchant], some are actual stores, others are just dummy NPC's that do not function as anything, but both say [Merchant], or [Banker], or stupid things like [Guard], [Friendly guy], [Sled maker]... etc... which is not worth identifying... making it hard to locate actual people needed, visually. The floating names and markers are also sometimes airborne and totally out of view. Some not showing until you are close enough to kiss the NPC, which often leads to death...)\n\nAll the above are mostly just annoyances, after having played for 100+ hours. They can all be lived-with, and most avoided, without "killing the game", but it may "kill your character" a few times...\n\nThis is still fun to play... Play it until it becomes a cluster-F like "Anarchy-online", then move-on to the next "new old-thing".","May 23, 2015","true","294.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Honestly, that's what first grabbed my attention for the game. I also like that the game is just as easy to play solo as it is with others. I enjoyed the combat system, think the UI is pretty efficient, and liked the crafting system. The characters and quests have a bit more thought put into them than your typical MMO, and that's pretty cool to. It's also fairly easy to get started in the game, and you can jump into it quickly, or take your time and look around. I also liked that, while you can certainly pay to get some pretty cool extras, I never felt like it was a pay-to-win game (that said, I have not played the PvP aspect of the game).\n\nThen the cons:\nThere were only a few things I didn't like in this game. The partying system is not friendly to players who are new to MMOs. I had a friend play with me, and, when I wasn't there, they had to google how to get some things done just to basic stuff in chat. You also can't tell what channel someone is on, even if they're in your party, although this can be worked around with a bit of communication. The game is also not very accommodating for people with disabilities. You can read more than a few threads on En Masse's website where people are asking for things as simple as a colorblind option, but they haven't been implemented into the game yet. There are also a few points where the physics breaks in the game or the world just disappears (but to be honest, most of them were when I spent 15min climbing that really tall mountain off in the distance that there was really no point to). There are also some repeatable quests in the game, and I didn't like that they would stay on your quest tracker hogging up space, and the only way to get rid of them is to permantly decline the quest. While these were minor issues for me, none of them ever got in my way of enjoying the game.\n\nWhy I'm not playing anymore:\nWhat did get in my way of enjoying the game was the community. The chat in the game is set up in different categories (global, trade, party, etc.), but many people will use the chats interchangibly. While a minor inconvience, this isn't particularly an issue in-and-of itself. What is a problem is what ends up flooding the chat. It often feels like the chat is 85-90% composed of children just hitting puberty and discovering the internet for the first time. Vulgar texts, insults, sexual solicitations, and more flood almost every chat channel almost constantly, even occassionaly (but more often than you'd think) straying into threats of various abuses. The community's solution appears to be ignore this, but it's difficult when you have to ignore a little less than a quarter of your screen. You could also mute those players, but there are so many, it would be an unending process. It also makes it difficult to find parties to play with when soloing because players halfway expect you to be a jerk and will just ignore you. and the game's partying system is also flooded with these conversations, so it's almost impossible to find a party when you're under level 60.\n\nDealing with the community (and by dealing with, I mean putting up with their juvenile behavior while trying to ignore it) ended up sucking the fun out of the game for me. After a witnessing two individuals have a particularly vulgar conversation that lasted for over an hour, I found myself considering uninstalling the game. Personally, I have a policy that, if a game ever makes you think about uninstalling it, you should just do it. It's just a game, and there are others like it out there. Nothing is lost by walking away, so my quest for a good, immservise MMO will continue.\n\nTL;DR: Game 7.5-8/10, but the community sucks and you sometimes want to uninstall.","June 20, 2015","true","66.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

There is some lag issues if you have an older laptop or computer, so that's one thing to consider. Overall, the game is very enjoyable, easy to learn for beginning players, and hard to forget.

Not really a grene i play very much anymore. I saw the gunner trailer and thought i would have a go at this one. The combat looked difrent and the gunner class looked OP as hell. Well, the combat is very good, super fast paced and no spam rotations BS. fights are much more engaging than i am used to in an MMO. I have enjoyed leveling alot more than i am used to in an MMO, not to say the story is good, frankly i have no idea what the story is all about. The quest pace and variance is great though. paired with a good LFG system i and glad to be leveling it doesnt feel like a chore.\n\nNow, the gunner class. what a OP as hell class. Never have i played such a class in an MMO before. I havent died once yet and am level 42. It also feels so powerful. this class along with the action combat is just a joy to play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AylinRM/recommended/323370/","AylinRM","Aylin Sunstrider","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AylinRM/","74 products in account","TERA, in my opinion, shows its strengths in several ways: one of them are the classes: very defined and whose gameplay as decisive and marked the gaming experience becomes something totally different depending on the selected class. I tried all classes, not races, and each approach offers diversity that we require a game of this nature. Undoubtedly, another important feature is the combat; As you know, TERA goes beyond the concept of focus other traditional MMORPG and forces us to target our characters in the direction we're going to hit, cast a spell, etc., provided with a central point of looking at screen. At the same time, the characters are real physics, so bother and obstruct. This is crucial in group meetings, instances, bosses, etc ?? A portion also are policy issues that I could prove in depth.\nAre there shades? Well yes. It is a game that still smells to east, both in its overall aesthetic aspects such as architecture, the clothes. And if you roll the sleeve does not go, he will back you. To me, in particular, I do not like it, but it makes the gameplay. So great has to be to me like.\nGraphically, TERA is a delight, if you exceed the oriental theme, so that at least compensates by. In another future post I contarel case of total revision of the appearance of the Elin race, although we can put it politically correct language: changed because the Korean aesthetic that showed he could be a lure for pedophiles. That's nothing.\nThe other issue is the economic model and connects with previous columns. We are facing a degree in English and a monthly fee. How many games are you willing to share playing Spanish users? Besides in English? Tradition and studies tell us that no more than one, so TERA, only for that matter, is placed in the struggle against large as World of Warcraft, Star Wars: The Old Republic or imminent The Secret World , with which, we predict, will maintain a tough battle for the wallet and user time in June.","July 13, 2015","true","31.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The begining part of the game is a lot of fun, and it has good pacing. Now, a thing that is bad in my opinion is the character generator. It seems really lacking compared to other generators that I have seen (except for Destiny's). And it feels like there is no reason to play as a male character in the game, because multiple classes are for female characters only, like the brawler.\n\nLike other games, I'm now addicted to Tera. I recommend that you play it if A: you're ok with playing as a femal most of the time, and B: you have a lot of free time, because you most likely will be addicted.","February 7","true","25.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That said, pay content is really one sided, playing as a male character you don't have nearly as many customizations as the females and the down side of being a female is the armour sets, even playing a tank class, you're not going to get a badass armour, you're getting a piece of cloth that barely covers your ~not that private~ areas.\nTera tends to break the immersion of the game a lot with mounts like the cars, just like Cabal Online with futuristic bikes and surfboards, this IS a problem, even if people like it, i mean, c'mom people.\nAt higher levels you start to see design lazyness when it comes to sets, all sets looks the same, so you are "compeled" to buy EMP and get something different.","July 27, 2015","true","411.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Mainly focused on combat, TERA offers exciting gameplay for any player, and with new content coming in regularly, it promises a rewarding experience for those willing to invest their time.. Definately worth every dollar I spent on it. ($0)\n\nThe combat in TERA is fast-paced and rewarding, regardless of class or role. I wouldn't call it a 'unique experience', but it feels very solid and demands your attention. Even the healing roles are given a lot of consideration.\nThe one downside that I have found is that there isn't much in the ways of ingame career options, so if your main focus in an MMO is the mercantile side of things, you may want to find another game.\n\nOverall, TERA deserves to go on your top 5 list if you're looking for a new game to waste your life in. It's a good game, and it's free. Nothing's better than free.","November 20, 2015","true","24.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liquidbliss/recommended/323370/","liquidbliss","❤ 『 Ｂｌｉｓｓ 』 ❤","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liquidbliss/","39 products in account","This game has it's issues. PvE is fairly dead this patch, as is the economy, not many ways to make money these days, and PvP has never been a huge part of the game so the community for it isn't that big. Lore is and always has been pretty poor quality, in my opinion. Not to mention leveling is so quick and brainlessly easy that you get people at end game who are still completely clueless.\n\nOther issues lie with how the game runs. It's great if you have a top tier computer, but even then you'll find issues. Small UI bugs once in a blue moon, disconnecting some days more than should be normal. Servers just aren't always stable. Especially during events, when the number of accounts logged into game are higher.\n\nBut where it falls short one can still finds redeeming qualities. PvE, even during the dead points can still be fun with friends. Same with PvP. The combat system in TERA is by far one of the most enjoyable I've crossed in any MMO. Graphics, if you like the artstyle, are wonderful. The environment is filled with scenery worth taking the time to stop and admire. Character creation, while not the best available, is still better than a lot of MMOs out there, offering a wide variety of options for personalizing your player character. And the cosmetics? Addicting. So be careful with that one! They just love to lock the best ones behind rng. But when you're a free to play game, it's not hard to picture where most of their income comes from.","November 20, 2015","true","377.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JD_Mortal/recommended/323370/","JD_Mortal","JD_Mortal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JD_Mortal/","27 products in account","Spent a few hours playing this game. 113, so far, and counting... This is not a "hasty review".\n\nOver-all, the game is a GREAT time-killer and well worth the play. (Most casual gamers can stop reading here.)\n\nNOTE: Get a 400-button mouse and chameleon-eyes to fully enjoy playing this game.\n\nThe game seems like it is being "reinvented" at the moment. It is changing from a goofy "story-mode" game, into a "novelty-play" game. The story was actually horrible, in a funny and goofy way, as if created by kids and programmers who have no idea what a story actually is, but had the power to create a great game.\n\nHowever, now the game is turning into a novelty-play game like "anarchy-online". Most things don't make sense in the world, added for fun, not for immersion of reality. Thus, breaking away from the story. (That is a good thing, but the story still exists. I imagine soon it will be removed too.)\n\nThe only "flaws", I see in the game, are the following...\n\n- Story-line makes no sense at all. (Island came out of nowhere, just before you arrive, yet has a multi-thousand-year "history" ?!?)\n\n- You "collide" with many things which you shouldn't, or should but they are in horrible locations that impede playing.\n\n- "look to aim" is a horrible setup, not a "new idea", that was abandoned because "it sucks". This game embraces the suck... Then demands that you also somehow attempt to maneuver, and watch cool-downs, and avoid terrain you can't see, and observe horribly split-up GUI elements. (Demands, as in, failing to watch gets you killed, often.)\n\n- Keys are buggy for input... (Goes with the look to aim issue.) You find yourself hitting keys multiple times, just to make them to work... then, hitting them twice often cancels things, so you end-up trying to make it work, then canceling it, once it works... leading to "undesired results", which impede the gameplay. (Leading to death often.)\n\n- Broken guidance to quests. (Many things it "assumes" you know. Like where "bob" is located. Not showing you where he is, on occasions.)\n\n- Over-done "visual blocking obstructions", where none are needed... Makes you have to walk around tons of walls to get around to the other side, everywhere... What should have been a direct 2-second walk, turns into a 1-minute journey. (That is over-exaggerated, but not far from the reality.) This includes the "outside world", which often seems like you are just running through bumpy hallways, not outside, other than seeing an over-populated sky you can't reach.\n\n- Nothing to do, once you have seen the whole world. It is not that large... Only thing left after hitting the level-cap, is PvP, which this game is not good for. (You collide with players on your screen, but on the server, they are not in that spot, thus, when you attack there, the server throws-out your hits, as there was no-one there on the server. They were 4-feet away from that spot. (That is why the whole "point to aim" system is often abandoned, or nerfed, or cheated. No-one has figured-out how to time-slip program yet. Well, they haven't.)\n\n- Lots of junk everywhere and a poor item-management setup. (That includes the auction-house and inventory system.) You can sell things that are "needed" on your character. {You can have multiple OUTFITS, but the "required items" do not "lock", thus, you can accidentally sell something another profile needs, and you end-up naked in battle when switching to that profile.. thus... death...} The rest of the stuff is just poorly sorted or isolated or grouped, and hard to identify, what should be easy to identify within the clutter... (Scrolls should all be together and consume fractions of slots not whole slots each, gems should all fit into one bag, not individual slots. Yet these things stack by the thousands... But if you have ten different ones, that is ten slots... but ten of the same, is a simple stack of ten in one slot?!?!?)\n\n- People have "labels" who do not need labels... and add confusion... (People labeled [Merchant], some are actual stores, others are just dummy NPC's that do not function as anything, but both say [Merchant], or [Banker], or stupid things like [Guard], [Friendly guy], [Sled maker]... etc... which is not worth identifying... making it hard to locate actual people needed, visually. The floating names and markers are also sometimes airborne and totally out of view. Some not showing until you are close enough to kiss the NPC, which often leads to death...)\n\nAll the above are mostly just annoyances, after having played for 100+ hours. They can all be lived-with, and most avoided, without "killing the game", but it may "kill your character" a few times...\n\nThis is still fun to play... Play it until it becomes a cluster-F like "Anarchy-online", then move-on to the next "new old-thing".","May 23, 2015","true","294.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So you only should play healer if your friend won't mind helping you all the time on quests, or if you don't mind spending 10x the time it tooks to a DPS to kill a mob as healer\n\n- This game has lots of bugs all over it, you will probably have to face a few that will make you have to restart the game.\n- The new dungeon's bosses are totally copy and paste with a few new mechanics....\n- If you are into crafting/alchemy prepare for the MASSIVE GRIND that it is to level your crafting levels.\n- The late game alliance points system is good but it is a little bit too easy for trolling...\n- If you're not into side quests, 90% of your time on the game will be just walking around, the main quests usually just make you travel the areas so you can get the side quests.\n\n\nTL;DR: Good game (with the exception of healer players), its grindy and there is some annoying bugs, but its all worth it","September 9, 2015","true","410.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's fluid in what you can do and how you control your character. The graphics are amazing, but you REALLY need a fast internet and good graphics card. After level ~40, everything seems to get redundant. Quests that are pretty much the same. I'm trying to learn how to make weapons and craft items, but it doesn't seem as simple as it does in Runescape (yes, the Runescape days). I wished some features like that were easier to do, but you can get discouraged really easily. However, the game is much more than crafting. You may never craft in your game and that's fine.

That said, pay content is really one sided, playing as a male character you don't have nearly as many customizations as the females and the down side of being a female is the armour sets, even playing a tank class, you're not going to get a badass armour, you're getting a piece of cloth that barely covers your ~not that private~ areas.\nTera tends to break the immersion of the game a lot with mounts like the cars, just like Cabal Online with futuristic bikes and surfboards, this IS a problem, even if people like it, i mean, c'mom people.\nAt higher levels you start to see design lazyness when it comes to sets, all sets looks the same, so you are "compeled" to buy EMP and get something different.","July 27, 2015","true","411.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AylinRM/recommended/323370/","AylinRM","Aylin Sunstrider","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AylinRM/","74 products in account","TERA, in my opinion, shows its strengths in several ways: one of them are the classes: very defined and whose gameplay as decisive and marked the gaming experience becomes something totally different depending on the selected class. I tried all classes, not races, and each approach offers diversity that we require a game of this nature. Undoubtedly, another important feature is the combat; As you know, TERA goes beyond the concept of focus other traditional MMORPG and forces us to target our characters in the direction we're going to hit, cast a spell, etc., provided with a central point of looking at screen. At the same time, the characters are real physics, so bother and obstruct. This is crucial in group meetings, instances, bosses, etc ?? A portion also are policy issues that I could prove in depth.\nAre there shades? Well yes. It is a game that still smells to east, both in its overall aesthetic aspects such as architecture, the clothes. And if you roll the sleeve does not go, he will back you. To me, in particular, I do not like it, but it makes the gameplay. So great has to be to me like.\nGraphically, TERA is a delight, if you exceed the oriental theme, so that at least compensates by. In another future post I contarel case of total revision of the appearance of the Elin race, although we can put it politically correct language: changed because the Korean aesthetic that showed he could be a lure for pedophiles. That's nothing.\nThe other issue is the economic model and connects with previous columns. We are facing a degree in English and a monthly fee. How many games are you willing to share playing Spanish users? Besides in English? Tradition and studies tell us that no more than one, so TERA, only for that matter, is placed in the struggle against large as World of Warcraft, Star Wars: The Old Republic or imminent The Secret World , with which, we predict, will maintain a tough battle for the wallet and user time in June.","July 13, 2015","true","31.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think this is a fair battle system and give a better chance for new player in this type of game to learn and be skilled player.\n\nAlthough the graphic and gameplay were wonderful and there are many classs were added. The gender lock make most of the player hate this game. But i think the gender lock about some of the classs make people who does not like char such as elin will not stick to the class that only can make by elin ( ninja, reaper).\n\nTERA also give a difficulty indicator to the player about every type of class, so, it give a not skilled player can enjoy this game with the class that esay to control.

Unfortunatley the engine is bland and outdated.\n\nPvP desyncs like crazy and is nothing but a slideshow no matter how much you try to optimize it for your system, and don't bother telling me my system is the problem because I can play any 2016 game on ultra w/o issue, Black Desert? flawless aside from the occasional internet and server issues.\n\nPvE is alright, Big ♥♥♥ Monster seem a lot easier apposed to before steam adopted the game. The aggro system is a bit confusing and with all the newer characters, tanks seem pretty useless until end game. So lancers, warrior, and berserkers enjoy the walking sim until late game.\n\nCrafting... Well it's your typical WoW crafting.\n\nSocial depends on what server you're on. RP/PvE if you want to meet decent people (experience may very) and PvP if you want to be treated like dirt.\n\nClasses - well I enjoy looking like a beast, tank, don't want to mess with this guy, type of guy. So male characters are strict to the original typical classes, but with all the new content is based mainly around female and the lolli sort and it aint my cup of tea. Devs are biased as all hell so be warned.\n\nAll in All, I would recommend this game, but only if you plan to play with others. If you just go solo you will get bored extremely fast and uninstall before you know it.\n\n","June 5","true","323.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One of the things I valued most about this game was its fantasy aesthetic, world, and lore.\n\nWhen they started selling swim trunks and bikinis, I wasn't very pleased, but I could live with it.\nWhen they sold lingerie and silk underwear I wasn't thrilled, but hey fanservice and 'RP' will happen.\nWhen they added Pixel Art styled weapon skins, my immersion was a little shaken.\n\nNow they sell mounts that are sports cars.\nNow they sell clothes that include snap back hats and rapper chains, along with gaudy wristwatches on each arm.\nNow they sell boomboxes you can wear on your back.\n\nThe devs or marketting department have seriously lost the plot.\nI don't foresee myself getting back into this game ever again.\nAlso, the mid-to-highbie population of my server is 9/10ths elin.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tekwerk/recommended/323370/","tekwerk","Yunocchi Rifleworks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tekwerk/","149 products in account","A very streamlined MMO experience. Drops the "roleplaying" out of "roleplaying game", with nonexistant character progression in lieu of a slot machine gear grind that encompasses the rest of the otherwise hollow experience. This allows the game to do what it's good at though: deliver fast-paced real time combat against tough endgame dungeons. Well, tough the first couple of times: once you ace a dungeon playing it becomes second nature to the point of nauseum, and you're expected to play these dungeons A LOT to get what you need to move onto the next set. Gear progression again is a game of chance, with ruthless, brutal gear improvement chances and only a slow, steady drip of the materials required to do so.\n\nThe PVP is a worthwhile experience, this is where the game's real time combat system shines, allowing for combos, skill, and familiarity with one's class to come into use in outwitting your opponents. Thing is, PVP has a steep, steep entry gate, requiring at least a mid tier endgame gear set to beat gear equalization. The battlegrounds included for instanced PVP are fun and well designed, and open world PVP doesn't always devolve into a gankfest, strangely enough.\n\nThe game never really struck me as "fun" though. Levelling wasn't engaging, could be slow at times, and never really gave a sense of accomplishment, only a sense of dutiful completion. The last 5 levels are some of the most boring, worthless experiences I've ever had in an MMO, and require a great deal of patience and tolerance to slog through. Getting your first set of endgame gear is easy, the game flat out gives you the materials required to do so, even more so with the new patch, but this is only to start you off on what will become one of the most hair-pullingly aggravating gearing experiences in video game history. Getting the next set of PVE oriented gear, merely one small step above the basically free gear you really kickstart the endgame with, can take months of dedicated, hardcore grinding, for tens of hours a day. It usually doesn't, but if you even suspect your luck might not be the greatest, this game will do everything in its power to punish you for it. Then when you finally get this gear, you can start all over again, on the top tier set, which takes this already unfair grind and turns it up to 11. As someone with not the greatest of luck and patience for this obsessive level of grind, I honestly cannot forsee myself EVER acquiring one of these sets; I have a job, I literally don't have the time required every day to fulfill the demands this game sets upon me. It's not impossible, but only nigh impossible.\n\nThe only reason this grind is so bad, again, is because the chance of a piece of gear advancing is abymsally low. It's insultingly low. The chance for advancing one level in a gear's improvement amount, once one gets into the higher amounts that the game requires for advanced level play, must be in the neighborhood of less than 1%. I'm not exaggerating. You will see failure, after failure, after failure, even for only OK gear. The game, plain and simple, does not want want you to do what's required of you to play.\n\nThis problem wouldn't be so bad if the game was worth it, but the well designed combat isn't stellar, it's only OK, only mediocre. Many, many other MMOs have even better action combat, and don't have such a soul-crushingly hopeless level of grind. This game will beat you down and spit on your battered corpse. It's not worth it. It's not worth your time.\n\nIn summary: TERA hates you","May 26","false","507.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can easily say it is the best MMORPG I have played yet, with a mystic as my main character it gives me everything I have always wanted. If your looking for a good, fun MMORPG, then stop looking and download Tera. Even if you dont like it, its free! So whats the harm?\nThe game doesn't push you at all to buy things with real money, almost anything is available to buy with in game money at a tradebroker as long as you have enough gold! True action combat style, so you can dodge stuff if your fast enough, a class for each need, each with different abilities to help eachother out, 2 great support classes if you are into that like I am, 2 tanks, and 3 (I think) classes for pure damage. If this is your first MMO, you will love it, and if you are experienced, it may be different from some others but you will come to love it as well.","June 1, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
