Then have I got good news for you! Claveblazers IS Spelunky... which is pretty much damning Caveblazers with praise. Yes, it's mechanically sound. Yes, it has some interesting little deviations from the Spelunky formula. Yes, there are a lot of interesting additions planned for the full launch.\n\nIt is, however,  unabashedly Spelunky Lite in nearly every meaningful way. There's imitation, and then there's Caveblazers.\n\nYou play as a tiny man/kid/dude armed with sword and bow, who's heard tell of a legend: find this cave, blaze within, profit. An ornery old man warns you against this, forgetting he's an NPC in a videogame and CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO. He is disregarded, and your adventure begins in earnest.\n\nFor Spelunky people this is all familiar territory: you enter a randomly generated vertical dungeon and descend, smashing crates and chests for loot, items, mysterious potions, and treasure, while avoiding traps and killing cave denizens. Variety at the moment is wanting... there's only one trap I've encountered so far (standard spike trap), and you'll slay a lot of the same bats, slimes, and little dudes over and over again.\n\nTreasure is used as a currency for various shrines that can give you all manner of boosts, and there are little blessings sprinkled randomly throughout each dungeon that can provide the same for free.\n\nHowever, this is a PSEUDO-MUTIPLAYER title, meaning little dudes that look identical to you will spawn on occasion during your descent. I'm... not entirely sure if they're always hostile or not (apparently their behavior is randomized – friendly, enemy, fearful). First playthrough I'm pretty certain the little pseudo-player fella that spawned for me was friendly until I peppered him with too much arrow fire. But after that every single one that spawned hated my guts – fortunately they hate the standard enemies with nearly the same enthusiasm, and they can all kill each other well enough.\n\nThese pseudo-players can grab power-ups, items, treasure and weapons just like you so it's critical you stay ahead of them. They also employ a more human-like strategy to ruining (or assisting!) your day, so best kill them or get out of the level as quickly as possible.\n\n\nIt's a cute little game, and I enjoy it. The combat feels good – enemies move fast, and each fatal blow feels impactful. The sounds (music, combat, ambiance) are excellent, the dungeon layouts are interesting, the RNG-y bits are RNG-y... it's just a bit more hollow, and a bit less charming than Spelunky. Now it's Early Access which means they intend to add new weapons and enemies, bosses, a proper endgame, customization – all that good stuff.\n\nI recommend Caveblazers in that it is a fun game that feels complete. Even if they don't finish every planned feature, it's an excellent little game that stands on its own currently. If you have any doubts or wish to see any feature properly implemented and not just hypothetical in hypothetical land, I recommend holding off and seeing how Caveblazers develops.","April 1","true","6.0"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","17","19","3","2"

The game itself controls pretty well, with some glaring issues(for me) - and unfortunately, I read in a few forums that the developer ditched progress on this game, so it's not likely to get fixed.  Here are my issues:\n\n~ It feels like the challenge in this game doesn't come from skill or learning how to get out of situations, it comes down to making do with the things you are denied, as a player - which smells like lazy game design, to me.  It's the old Resident Evil trick of limiting bullets to make a game "scary" - but Caveblazers is not at all atmospheric, and the denial of abilities is cumbersome.\n\n~ The bow only fires at a single pixel, and the hit box isn't expanded - you should be able to fire in analog directions, not just the cardinal 8.  It SEVERELY limits the bow's usefulness, especially with the damn bats, who take multiple hits to kill and come in at an angle your bow can't quite hit because of a cliff or obstruction.\n\n~ Your melee weapon does not hit its' own hit box - it swings a box ahead.  That makes breaking pots and chests and stuff that are on the edges of platforms very tricky, if you only have a single square to swing - you literally have to carefully scoot to the edge or hop down and back up the wall to smack it, and then the treasure falls down somewhere you have to retrieve.  This really breaks the flow of the game, for me.\n\ related: I have not seen any melee weapons that swing past the arc of the regular sword, yet, which is disheartening because it's got such limited range.\n\n~ No customization, all your weapons and bows and their swings/shots look the same in the animation.  You look like a white guy in a blue shirt.  The fake AI players are white guys in a blue shirt.  It wouldn't take much to color a weapon strike, or draw a few extra pixels to differentiate them visually - especially in a minimalist game like this.  It would be a weekend job, tops.\n\n~ The fake AI players serve no real purpose other than to annoy the hell out of you and steal your stuff or hunt you down - I would be fine with this if they offered some kind of reward for killing them, maybe dropping some of the loot they acquired, but they simply serve to block progress.\n\n~ The monsters, also, are just barriers to progress - they don't drop loot or items, and makes killing and getting past them really boring, really fast.\n\nThis game is great, in theory - it just needs polishing.  But as for right now, I wouldn't recommend it.","May 18","false","0.8"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/recommended/452060/","randomiseuser","RandomiseUser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/","284 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCaveblazers is a difficult, randomised platformer that resurrects that feeling of "just one more go" from when you first played Spelunky, adding a greater focus on combat and random items.\n\nIt feels like a patchwork of existing ideas, most obviously from Spelunky, but also from modern roguelites such as Risk of Rain and true roguelikes such as Nethack. It also throws in cool ideas of its own, such as the AI bots that pretend to be other players, competing for the same loot as you.\n\nLike Spelunky, you start at the top and make your way down a random cave, fighting enemies and collecting treasures. But Caveblazers adds loads more special items to collect (and store in your RPG-style inventory). They're vital to keep your health up and upgrade your weapons so you can keep up with the game's increasing difficulty.\n\nGameplay review video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf6Rp5tmZG4\n\nSpeaking of weapons, from the start you're armed with a sword and a bow. Don't expect to be immediately good with them - you'll need practice with both (this is not an easy game!). The sword has a short range and requires expert timing to avoid being damaged, even by the most basic enemies. The bow is slick and endlessly useful, but only fires in eight directions, despite using the right analogue stick to shoot. Both can get swapped out with better versions as you rummage through crates and chests.\n\nOnce you get a groove on, you'll notice the level styles change satisfyingly fast - the first four levels of Spelunky are all the same, whereas in Caveblazers you've already reached a temple by level 3. More area styles (and more items, enemies etc) are promised in future updates.\n\nOther roguelike elements include differently coloured potions that you need to drink to establish which potion it is (with good or bad effects), the ability to spend money at Risk of Rain-style shrines, rings that bestow bonus effects (but you only have 2 ring slots), magic wands and other special effect items.\n\nThe "pseudo-multiplayer" idea is fun. Basically, the game spawns intelligent bots that look just like you, who go round collecting treasure and fighting enemies, just like you. Apparently they have different personalities, but usually they just try to murder you. They offer quite a fight - they can do anything you can, including healing and using special items - and are therefore best avoided. Also, it's a shame they don't drop any loot upon death.\n\nThe graphics are a touch disappointing - they're in the style of the original free version of Spelunky, which feels a bit tired in 2016. The screens aren't very exciting to look at, especially since so many of the elements (such as chests, spikes, bats and slimes) are over-familiar. Even just a little more set decoration would polish things up nicely.\n\nCaveblazers has only just hit early access, so quibbles aside I'm eager to see how the game develops. It's already fun and slick for an alpha game, and crucially doesn't feel half-broken or massively incomplete.\n\nIn summary, Caveblazers feels like somebody thought "What if I take Spelunky, keep the stuff that it does well, ditch anything annoying and focus more on the actual fighting?". And it works. It's not original and should try harder to get out of Spelunky's shadow, but damn, it's hard to put down.\n\n* Game version reviewed: alpha 0.1.1 (29 March 2016)\n\n* More gaming videos from Randomise User","April 1","true","5.2"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/452060/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nRupeck Games have taken the formula that made Derek Yu’s Spelunky one of the most beloved indie games of the past decade and tweaked it to provide gamers their own take on the rogue-like action adventure game. It’s a big ask for any studio let alone one that has never released a game onto Steam before. However, what they have to offer thus far in their early access release has left a positive impression not only on me but all but two of the Steam reviews as of writing.\n\nMost important of all the game is already technically sound. The game play is smooth and thoroughly enjoyable. Nothing feels unfair. The graphics are simplistic but it is easy on the eye and allows you to focus at what is most important while the soundtrack has been carefully chosen to provide for deeper immersion. I quite enjoyed that a point of differentiation is that there are plenty of other cave diggers in these levels with you. It is up to you to discover whether they are friendly, apprehensive or literally out to kill you. Can you work with those that aren’t going to kill you or will you attempt to slaughter them to ensure that everything within the level is yours for the taking? Be mindful, however, that they hit hard and can be every bit as dangerous as the slimes, bats and other enemy minions out there. The developer has done a marvelous job at creating their artificial intelligence to the point where many times they feel every bit as much another human controlled player as artificially controlled. In this respect Rupeck Games label the game a pseudo-multiplayer game. The game takes on rogue-like aspects in that the game features permanent death as well as procedural level generation.\n\nThe inventory system is one of my favorite aspects of the game. You’ll find plenty of things out there that can aide in your journey. There are quite a few potions that are named after colors, for example, jade potion.  You likely wont ever be told what they actually do and their effects can have a negative consequence (e.g. causing slowness). Using a bad one at the wrong time can aide in your death so be careful!\n\nThe only real downside to the game is that it does not have an end point at this point in development. That is to come. So for those of you who like to have a game that has a certain point of closure you will not yet find that here.  Some may argue that the graphics are a little too simplistic but as I said I found them to be acceptable and others may argue that the game is not original enough but and again I would suggest that they need to look deeper into the game.\n\nAt a price tag of $4.99 I would suggest that the game is well worth the investment especially considering the potential of a price increase down the track.","May 2","true","6.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Throwing everything 'unneccessary' out of its (at least visual) inspiration Spelunky, it adds a quite sophisticated and believable AI in form of 'pseudo-multiplayer', i.e. NPCs that act like other players. Some are murderous b*stards that try to kill you in every way possible, some are just there for the loot and glory, others tend to keep close to you and help out a bit.\n\nWhat I like a lot about the NPCs is that they feel like being given a gamepad and let loose in the dungeon. Their pathing, jumping, attacking feels just like your own. Sadly, they have no problems whatsoever healing on the fly, whereas the player has to open his inventory with start, possibly navigate to the healing item with the d-pad, hitting A to eat and close his inventory again with start. Some sort of quick-select menu in the HUD that would let you pre-select a bit of meat with the d-pad and just hit a button to actually consume would help a lot.\n\nSo what does it have?\n- procedural generated levels out of 'level-chunks', starting you at the top of each level with the exit at the bottom, just like Spelunky\n- melee and ranged attacks (melee on X, 8-directional shooting with the right thumbstick - which makes jumping (A) and shooting a bit tricky in the beginning)\n- consumables: unidentified potions, mostly beneficial with some nasty ones in between, bombs, stun and lightning 'grenades', good selection of swords and bows to find, magic items that usually need to charge up for a while before you can use them, lots of gems and such as currency for the\n- shrines that may heal you fully or sell you potions or wands\n- quite a selection of blessings in the form of runes that float in the air and you have to jump into them to gain their effect - they freeze you for a bit, so watch out for nasties before getting them\n\nAs of now, the game has no story, ending or bosses, it's a fast-paced, difficult score attack game with online leaderboards - which makes the hard NPC 'players' a real asset to the game, I can only hope they do not get nerfed too much after the (forseeable) complaints about their OP-ness.\n\nAgain, for 5 bucks it's a steal, just get it.\n\nPeace\n","April 1","true","15.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","1"

With the passion of a thousand burning suns. It seems like whenever I go online there is some 12 year old dropping racial epithets, uber-leveled trolls making life impossible for new guys, amoung other annoyances.\n\nSo when i first saw that one of Caveblazer's talking points is "faux online play" i was interested. After buying it and settling into a game session, I was slightly put off by the fact that it seems to be a copy/paste of spelunky. The intro is similar, the cave mechanic is similar, the only things that are different is the art style and allocation of items (starting and otherwise)\n\nBut then i played the game a bit more...\n\nCaveblazers is undoubtedly inspired by spelunky, and as a guy who enjoyed that game immesely, it really kind of felt like slipping to a comfortable pair of shoes. The diferences begin there however, as the enemy types take much more effort to kill, primarily because you are going into the cave with a rusty sword and a fairly mediocre bow. Also: where spelunky has a "here is a generic set of tools, get used to them as they are the normal, with speciality items being the exception", caveblazers loves to throw all sorts of shennanigans at you. From unlabeled potions of various colors, all sorts of upgrades for your bow and sword (including but not limited to: explosive, flak arrows, poison arrows, ice arrows, fire sword, 0 damage sword, the list goes on) as well as blessings, passive yet amazingly useful bonuses and perks.\n\nAnother interesting point i mentioned earlier is the "faux multiplayer" aspect of it. You are not the only adventurer in the cave! Every level has at least one, somtimes up to 3 (as far as i have seen at this early access stage) AI of varying temperment. Some of them will aggro the enemies, clearing the way for you. Some will ignore you entirely, darting in and out of your screen for a moment. While others will instantly go on the offensive and attack you without provocation! In this regard, while it is frustrating to lose an awesome build/run because some AI decided to be a jerk, it does lend a darker feel to the game. Not unlike dayZ, where each time you see another adventurer pop into view, you give it distance and try to judge what its attempting to do, before making a decision about it. Another good part about the AI is that it is generally well programmed, pathfinding nicely and even giving you space when you find loot (it wont swoop in and steal all the prizes and blessings you just knocked out of a chest).\n\n\nAll in all this game has a lot of potential, and I look forward to watching it evolve over time! Its sale price right now was $4.49 and i would reccomend getting it if you are a fan of spelunky and other rougelike games\n\n7.5/10 (not an 8 yet because it still has a way to go before being a full game.

Caveblazers is also pretty detailed when it comes to possibilities (like shooting downwards into wallgrab into walljump into second downward shot), it also features a character progression system without the use of experience points and levels, basing itself entirely into finding special runes which grant you added perks such as double jumps or randomly shooting lighting bolts. While this does break the traditional 'build your character as you desire' sort of philosophy in favor of a more random and unexpected gameplay progression, it helps settle variety and testing your skills in all possible ways feels refreshing.\nAs of the second patch (which came just a few days after release) the development in Early Access shows promise.

I can definitely see it being the comparative game for all others that will follow further into development and release.\n\nI had issues getting a Playstation 4 controller to work with the game so I can only speak for keyboard controls, but even with this minor issue (and the only bug I could find overall) [EDIT: I have been told PS4 controller support will come in the future, not a bug] the controls are incredibly responsive and easy to figure out. You get so drawn into playing the game that each keystroke just feels like a natural extension of yourself. I never expected to be as immersed as I was in the game and this was a major factor towards that.\n\nGraphically the game is sound. I am a huge fan of pixel graphics, but only when they are done properly. And boy, were they done properly here. The animation is deliberate and fluid. Every entity's walk cycle is gorgeous. The particle and lighting effects are beautiful. Personally speaking, I loved the arrow effects that would change with each blessing and bow that you encounter.\n\nGameplay wise Caveblazers is refreshing. I have never been the biggest fan of a roguelike game in the past, but can typically appreciate them for their merits. This was never the case in this game. I found the challenge to push as far as I could to be more rewarding than in other roguelikes I have enjoyed in the past (See: Dungeon Souls & Hero Siege). Another aspect I noticed keeping me coming back was the joy I got from actually exploring the stage and finding as much loot as I possibly could. Generally speaking, I am not a completionist of this sort, but Caveblazers has such a sense of exploration and discovery driving the gameplay that I simply couldn't help myself.\n\nThere is a lot to talk about and experience within Caveblazers, but as I stated before, this is a game about discovery and I'd rather you have a chance to see it for yourself. This is one early access title you do not want to miss out on supporting. Buy this game and buy it today.","April 1","true","2.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

As far as roguelite games go, the movement is very fluid and the combat very challenging.  Moving around is a lot of fun, and the combat feels very visceral in spite of the low-count pixel-art.  It's fast, frenetic and you will die a LOT.\n\nYou might be wonder what the hell "pseudo-multiplayer" is.  All it really is, is that other adventurers exist that are the same as your own character, complete with inventory items and potions and healing items and everything.  Everything you can do, they can do.  They're controlled by AI.  I'm not a fan of "pseudo-multiplayer" as a term, but that's neither here nor there.  These other adventurers can be friendly, they could care less about you, or they could just be absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and murder you.  You never know how they'll react when they find you, and it adds an interesting layer of tension.\n\nAs you progress you can collect items, upgrade your equipment, find terrible potions, find helpful potions, gain blessings (pretty much just beneficial passive effects), and murder your fellow adventurers.\n\nThe game is still early but it exhibits a LOT of potential.  For 5 bucks, I think there's a lot to love here and I can only see it getting better and better.\n\n\nGameplay video below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6-clDHtzOs\n\nKey provided by developers.","April 1","true","1.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/metroretrogaming/recommended/452060/","metroretrogaming","[ᴸᴼᴳ]Metro Retro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/metroretrogaming/","1476 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIntroductionPublished and developed by Rupeck Games, Caveblazers is a fast paced roguelike game with randomly generated levels, a vast amount of enemies, items and weapons that you can find whilst you play through each run of this game.\n\nGameplayThe first point to take from Caveblazers is that this game is categorized as a roguelike game. This game is suppose to be difficult and cruel to you throughout the time that you play it. That doesn’t mean, however, that this game isn’t fun. With the increasing difficulty of the game, it is very satisfying to complete just one level through your run, which is what a difficult game should have all together to make the player keep coming back to it. Although I did find that sometimes the game would be way too difficult and it discouraged me to play the game anymore.\n\nWith this game being categorized as a roguelike genre of gaming, it does offer the main mechanics that a game of this genre should have. With randomly generated levels, a dungeon crawler feel to it, the difficulty curve that should go at a steady pace and permadeath. Caveblazers does most of this fairly well, with each level being randomly generated it really does add replay value to this game making you come back to play more.\n\nWith the starting weapons that you acquire before entering the level, there are several types of attacks. Within the short tutorial that you are given before you enter the first level you are given a sword and bow in order to fight the enemies that are in the levels. The sword has a few functions that you can use, you have your normal slashing from left to right and then you have a upward and downward strike which is rather helpful when you are attacking enemies from above or below. The bow takes more accuracy and precious timing in order to get right, you are going to need to use the bow in order to hit enemies from a distance as just using your sword isn’t always going to work. I found that the key bindings for the bow and arrow a little weird for a weapon that requires accuracy and precious timing. You will need to use the arrow keys in order to aim your bow, therefore being restricted to only eight directions (Up, up left, left, left down etc.). I would of liked the option to be able to use the mouse to be able to aim the bow as this is a much more precious and better to use than the restricted arrow keys.\n\nThis game does seem to have a small amount of RPG elements that are implemented into the game, like artifacts that you can collect to increase your character’s stats and be able to progress through the game a little easier. You may encounter these artifacts throughout your runs that will increase your character’s stats, though these will be randomly chosen for you. Some of these artifacts include Knights bleeding, Blessing of Endurance, Volatile blessing and many more that will up your stats of the character that you play as throughout of of the runs.\n\nThroughout your run you will find many items inside of chests and crates that you will have to smash open in order to obtain. These items will become vastly useful as you play through the game and get to the challenging levels. These items could range from upgrades of your weapons, consumables that you can use to heal up, and buff up your character for for the good or bad. Another item you will find a lot is money in chests and crates that you can spend on statues that will help your character.\n\nThe enemies AI is rather well played out, and the variety amount of enemies is rather nice. Some of the enemies will attack each other if they come across each one other with the possibility of them killing each other, making it easier for you. While some enemies have the same sort of mechanics as you do, being able to wall jump and hold the same starting weapons you own, there are other types of enemies such as bats, slimes and bandits that will attack you as well.\n\nThe soundtrack for this game is superb, it really sets the game up to be a fast paced sort of game that will require accuracy. Upon entering the caves, the music is very well suited to the atmosphere. This combined with the sound effects of each of the attacks and moves that you do are really nice, but I feel like they can sharpen up a bit on them.\n\nWith the new enemies that you will come across as you progress through each area there will be new enemies that you will encounter. The graphics of this game are rather nice, as you get through each area you will realize that the areas will change and will look different from the previous one. It does seem that the graphics aren’t as polished as some of them could be. The areas do give off that atmosphere that you are enclosed in a cave and that you are going in deeper into each of the areas.\n\nPros+ Variety of weapons\n+ Nicely designed graphics\n+ Varied enemies and nice AI\n+ Nice music and sound effects\n+ Full controller support\n\nCons- Bow hasn’t got the option to use mouse to aim\n- Game can be a bit too difficult at times\n- Sound effects could be worked on a bit\n\nResult / Final thoughtsIn conclusion, Caveblazers is a very fun but difficult roguelike game that requires accuracy and precious timing in order to be able to proceed through each of the levels.There is a nice variety of enemies, items and weapons that you can acquire throughout your runs. Although the bow needs the ability to be more accurate and the game’s sound effects need to be a bit more crisp, the game is very fun and addicting to play.\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nFor more in-depth game reviews for indie and AAA games, be sure to check out the Feed Me Pixels[feedmepixels.com] website.","April 22","true","1.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I think there's certainly a fair amount of effort put into the game and the concept seems to be something along the lines of Spelunky meets Vagante, except with the worst parts of each. Granted it's early access so perhaps the developer may make changes in future to make the game more enjoyable, balanced, and rewarding, but for the time being, everything in the game is just.... lacking, to say the least. I certainly hope to one day be able to change this review so that I might recommend this game, but it's gonna take quite a bit of work before I can do that.

One game you play a pink potion may give you +30 health where as in another game a pink potion might set you alight. This adds to a kind of 'risktaking' factor.\n+Random map gen means every game the chests, blessings, exit door, etc will all be in different locations you you essentially have new challenges to face.\n+The price is really low for the amount of entertainment you can get.\n-------------------------------\nNeutral\n=The pathfinding system is pretty good in this game for the pseudomultiplayer character guys but for other enemies its pretty lacking. A lot of enemies will try to jump over something to get to you and they will continue to jump in that same place unable to move.\n=Add an option to return to the main menu from the death screen. It is kind of annoying to have to start a new run only to exit out.\n=Melee range is weird. You can be standing over a chest/pot swinging and still wont be able to break it open.\n-------------------------------\nCons\n-Ranged weapon combat sucks, which in itself sucks considering how big of a role ranged combat plays in this game. I played this game on keyboard and you can only shoot in 8 directions, cross and diagonally, making some enemies very hard to hit. Please add an option for keyboard users to have the mouse to aim with as it would help a ton.\n-Right now this game is a bit shallow in item variation. From blessings to weapons they can get pretty repetitive.\n-This one is kind of a silly one but as of right now the player (yourself) and all the pseudomultiplayer guys (AI) have the exact same character model. Nothing wrong with this but in fights of 3+ fighters in the exact same oufit and it can be confusing who you are controlling. Add something to differentiate us from the enemies.\n-------------------------------\nAll in all you are getting a fair amount of content for the price. This game is by no means groundbreaking but at the same time I think it is good enough that you will enjoy playing it if you are a fan of the permadeath/rougelite genre.\nI'll also change my review as the game is updated or I think of anything else.

Now I wholeheartedly recommend it.\n\nPros:\n1. A runthrough takes the perfect amount of time\n2. The game in its current state is well worth the price, yet it just came out in early access and is planned to have many content updates.\n3. Weapons and blessings make each run feel delightfully different from each other (Almost Isaac levels of different)\n4. When you do cool maneuvers to get out of risky situations, you feel awesome. The game controls really well.\n5. Most enemies are at just the right threat level.\n6. Getting high scores is really satisfying.\n\nCons:\n1. The typical potion system with colored potions having unknown effects is present in this game. Like other roguelikes with this system, potions are identified after being used once, but you can only use those potions on yourself, which, as usual, makes the whole system not worth trying out due to riskiness. It either needs a system where you can throw potions at enemies to identify their effect, or potions need to have mostly positive effects. Isaac's pills would be a good place to look. All pills are either positive or neutral except for 1 pill that deals 1 damage to you.\n\n2. You can't tell how a pseudo-multiplayer enemy feels about you until they shoot the first arrow at you. Since they are by far the scariest potential enemy in the game, they NEED to have different colored shirts or something based on their "personality." You cant really exploit them as an interesting game mechanic if you have to hide from every single one you see to not take damage.\n","April 3","true","10.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The potion's can either help or hurt as well.  You will also find blessings, which upgrade various abilities.  My only con is that there is no real reason to fight the enemies. They never drop coins or gems. There is no xp bar either.  I guess the only real reason to attack them is to build up a charge meter for special items you collect throughout the level.\n\nThe graphics are very simplistic.

During my few runs in Caveblazers I always felt dying was my own fault and unless I was low health I was not afraid to fight everything. I also never felt overpowered even with my health draining sword and bow that shot out grenades as my health never stayed at full for long. There is a confirmed ending and a boss fight for each area as opposed to just going through seemingly endless floors for no gratification.

The first thing knockback, when I get hit it feels like I go flying across the map it really needs to be nerfed by alot. Second enemies I dont like the damaging system or the AI adventurers on these enemies, like how a bat does around 10 damage in the beginning, the adventurer doesnt even really attack you, and the bouncy blue guys that explode are insanely hard to hit so they end up killing you. Then my last problem is loot, so when I kill a fellow adventurer I expect it to drop an item because thats a adventure, but when I kill it if it picked up something in the level then it only drops that so yeah or a chance from any enemy to drop an item maybe just some gold maybe a weapon. Also swords seem to always give you a disadvantage like -5 attack range -3 knockback something like that. When I play a game like this I expect some those items to give you an disadvantage but not all of them apparently every sword I found so far always negative. So far I rate this 4/10 I don't really recommend it unless you're willing to only make it to the second level.","June 4","false","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyPanther/recommended/452060/","CrazyPanther","Draconis Nox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyPanther/","954 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is trash, first of all. I keep seeing it compared to Risk of Rain, of which I am a god at on the highest settings. This garbage doesnt even have propper hit detection on it to be comparable to any other rogue platformer I own. It tried hard to be something I dont feel it can be.\n\nIf you are next to a mob, and you are facing away from it. Logically you would think "Hey I can turn around and swing." but in this 'game' pushing the other direction will ALWAYS move you into the mob instead, to which any swing you make will go BEHIND the mob and miss all together. Apparently thats a thing...unlike Risk of Rain where you can actually face another direction without being forced to move.\n\nThe lowest level teir mobs do the most damage. One blob that jumps into you or a bat that flys at you, the very first mobs encountered in this game, can mannage to do upwards of 50 damage, or half of your health without any reason other than this game has no "invincibility" or "delay" when the enemy is detected as hitting you. They also can mannage to get between your melee swings if you can imagine how that happens, more often then not, which leaves you having to use bow only through the majority of the game.\n\nThe "Bow" is the right analog stick. Jump is the "A" button and Melee is the "X" button. Do you see the problem here? If being forced into using ranged attack because melee is complete feces, you are forced to have to constantly manuever between bow and jump and having a half second delay between each. At the pace this game is set, this makes no sense. It woudl have been fine to have Y as bow, and stop you from moving while shooting. That would have at least allowed you to jump and fire downward without delay or difficulty.\n\nThe Melee is a joke. Most things just go through your melee unless you are fortunate enough to find a rune with explosive melee attacks on it. Even then, you leave it up to compelete chance to actually function, since the explosions are  RANDOM.\n\nJumping is trashy too. The lack of air control on this game makes me wonder what the person creating this intended. If I thrust DOWN with melee attack (Aka Zelda 2) USUALLY I go in a straight line directly down even from the mid arc of my jump. This is unreliable. This game tried to force you into one cube or another (The game is made of cubes and bricks of space. I will call them cubes for refferance of meaning.) Much like the fact that "turning around" forces you to step into a cube in the direction you wish to face, down thrusting and jumping does the same, though in a very ♥♥♥♥ poor manner. If you are between two cubes on their center line while down thrusting, the game picks the worst one for you to occupy 100%. It will pick the cube NOT occupied by a mob instead of dropping you on the top of the mobs head like it is supposed to and force you to watch as you take massive damage.\n\nJumping also doesnt connect with walls many times, making you slide down without registering the "catch" on the wall and forcing you to be unable to jump.\n\nMelee gets 'stuck' and doesnt allow you to attack, and bows have random aim even when uneffected by gravity, mnaking the precision required to aim in this game almost pointless unless something is trapped and unmoving.\n\nEnemy damage is way too high. You have 100 hit points to start, which sounds like a lot. Mobs on the first map can do 10-40 points of damage in one strike. Which pretty much makes you avoid everything that you can. Is litterally dodge ball. Food is scarce and this isnt something fun to deal with since the smallest mobs in the game (Bats) can hit you 3 or 4  times in less time than it takes you to swing once due to how poorly this game handles damage and hitting.\n\nOver all it doesnt feel like a rogue so much as an IWTBTG hack.\n\nAn eye blistering lack of detail in this game makes it hard to see everything at once. Its very retro and the graphics are terrible even for that. Its like Lemmings on low-rez. Music is the same song over and over, and it doesnt really fit the game. Its more like ambient trance or something rather than music I woudl call for adventure on.\n\nIn its current state I cant even see this being a reasonable game to buy. Maybe when its done.","April 13","false","7.6"," 3 of 24 people (13%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","13","3","24","2","0"

Combat is challenging and takes practice to get timing down.\n\n+Art fits the genre and looks good in action.\n\n+ Decent number of items currently, though overall they will need to be expanded on a great deal to keep replayability there.\n\nNeutral:\n/ Low enemy variety: I think i faced the same enemy spawns from level 10 - 110, jsut with higher HP and stats. We already know that this is being added to.\n\n/ Item diversity: Weapon variety isn't bad at all, but there are standouts in each category that make the other options feel like obvious throw aways. Namely magic items- I found the crystal skull to be the only one worth using as the attack options are just underwhelming.\n\n/ Level variety: Despite being procedural I was able to recognize repeated map layouts/sections during the long run I completed. Casual gamers may never notice- I certainly did.\n\nCons:\n- Inventory system: It's just plain terrible in its current implementation and without question the games biggest negative. My advice would be to rebind the Inventory button to either R1 or L1- it allows more natural finger movements during combat meaning you can access your inventory while moving and fighting- thats not possible bound to the Back key. With this method I was able to hit the keys so fast the UI didnt even pop up on screen meaning i could use something like 6-10 heal items a second.\n\n- Current replayability: I made it to floor 110 on my 3rd run and only stopped cause I was 6 hours in and once you make it that far you're never gonna die anyways, you're literally just playing until your controller falls apart.\n\n- The Faux player Ai mechanic: it was interesting the first 5 minutes, after that it became obvious its a just player trolling feature. regardless of all the things they could possibly do with/to your char- in the end they just attack you and cause you headaches. I rather enjoyed reaching the point they would just die immediately upon spawning, around floor 60 or so I think.\n\n\nThis is a really nice game, if you enjoy the genre this one is a must buy considering its still in early dev time- it should only get better from here.\n","April 26","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
