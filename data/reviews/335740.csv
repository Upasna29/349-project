"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tyson0717/recommended/335740/","Tyson0717","Rumberries","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tyson0717/","59 products in account","I purchased this game regardless of lack of reviews, so after playing through this game I feel obligated to help others make their decision.\n\nBasically this game is exactly what you are already expecting. A point and click exploration puzzle game, there is nothing here you have not essentially seen before. The only unique factor I noticed in that this game tries very hard to create an atrmosphere through impressive visual and audio effects.\n\nI only play this style of game occasionally so I have limited opinion regarding its actual level of difficulty. I admittedly used the hint button a few times when stuck. I found the times I went for a hint, the answer turned out to be something I would have never pieced together on my own. With that said I think some puzzles were overly difficult. At the same time the majority of the game was quick and easy. So I guess the developers aimed for a balanced average, but after the game is said and done I feel like there was no difficulty balance at all.\n\nI finished the game in about 2 hours using hints when I was stuck and fealt I had tried everything. Admittedly those hints sped things up significantly, but I still feel like I paid for a short game with no replay value. With that said I am not happy with my decision, but no worries, I waste my money all the time.\n\nOverall I only recommend this game to someone who really anjoys this style of game, doesn't expect anything new from this genere and can accept that the difficulty balance is ridiculous. Honestly I had some fun, but I regret making the purchase.","December 5, 2014","false","1.7"," 37 of 47 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","37","47","0","0"

Because it's Adventure-Puzzle Game. I didn't press the "Hint" button because I wanted to solve puzzles by myself. Of course you can press button "Hint" or look at Walkthrough and finish such Adventure-Puzzle Games in 10 minutes, but it is not interesting. Train Your Brain! Developers, critics, publishers, vendors, players, please add the word Puzzle to the description of genre of such games, including of course the word Adventure too. Because it's the very correct name of the genre.","December 6, 2014","true","0.4"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","0"

It was a dark, mysterious adventure; however, it was way too short and easy to solve.  I would have liked a bit more of a challenge.  The last video in the game is missing, which was a big disappointment.  I was able to end the game through Task Manager then continue by way of the game menu screen, and the final video finally showed up.  I truly don't understand why Interia would put a game on the market with such a huge bug.  Even with that, I'll recommend the game for its eerie atmosphere, nice graphics and music, and because I enjoyed the hour of winding my way through the ghostly mansion.","January 15, 2015","true","1.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

On one hand, it has an intriguing story so far, a GREAT sense of atmosphere and suspense, and lovely visuals.  It's also made me aware of just how badly this genre of games NEEDS to have a reactive cursor.\n\nWhich this game doesn't have.\n\nSo far I've had to hit up the hint system more than once just to find out what I could pick up, or move. It's not obvious. At all. So I reccomend this game for the mood and music, and add a note of caution - the gameplay is rough, and may be more frustrating than you like.","January 6, 2015","true","0.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Music carried on but nothing else. Had to use task manager to escape (from the game not the manor!).\nAs for gameplay, it was both very simple and very frustrating - no highlighted areas or indication as to what actions to take. Ended up using the hint button to figure out what to do. Some actions/items although were glaringly obvious and the one mini game was so easy it was laughable.\nOverall it was a boring, uninteresting waste of 69 mins and I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.","June 12, 2015","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Buchmensch/recommended/335740/","Buchmensch","buchmensch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Buchmensch/","1021 products in account","This is quite a good game. True, it's terribly short - I didn't use any hint and was done in aprox. an hour, and for that length, it's rather expensive. It can feel a bit plain at first, maybe due to the fact that it doesn't use that fancy ornate cursor we're used from Hidden Object Games but the system cursor, and there's no talking, only sound and music (except for one situation where you have to dial a phone number). I had played previous games by this developer (not available on Steam), which were dense, athmospheric, had very good voice acting and a compelling story - and they were nice and long. Compared to them ("Margrave: Curse of the severed heart" and "Margrave: The Blacksimth's daughter"), "Escape from Darkmoor Manor" comes short, and I wonder if they run out off funding.\n\nHowever, if you regard this game as a ghost story, it works, and for a ghost story, the length is just fine. This is not Lovecraftian horror, but if you like stories by M.R. James or E.F. Benson, this is the game for you. There's no hidden object scenes, and though there are some puzzles, you don't buy this game for the puzzles. Buy if for the story it tells. Diary pages scattererd around a derelict house are nothing new, but this time, the story is told well, and combined with the eerie atmosphere, subtle music and sound effects, it's spine-tingling. No jump scares, no moaning spirits, but when I played this game late at night and was ready to enter the last room, the one the diary said noises came from at night, I felt safer to quit the game and wait until morning.\n\nSometimes all it needs is a compelling story. What I liked about this one was that usually when you walk a house in a hidden cbject-style game, you'll find rooms barred and locked with puzzle locks and covered in cobwebs, allegedly not open in ages, but if you open them you find the room behind it inhabited, or Doctor Evil is already there, or stuff like this. In Darkmor Manor, not only is the house truely deserted - the diary also tells the story of how or why each door was locked, of why keys were hidden or doorknobs went missing, all without feelings forced. There's a palpabled connection between the story told in the diary and the visuals, making this game an interactive ghost story.\n\nIt's a short game, but I don't mind having paid almost 4 Euros for it. Just like re-reading a good story now and then to enjoying the spine-tingling sensation, I can imagine re-playing this game in a year or so.","December 29, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
