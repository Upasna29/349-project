It's a fun flight sim with a lot of missions to do.\n- Some people might not be able to run this game properly on modern machines, but that's fixable with a little bit of registry editing, setting the correct settings (Like choosing Hardware TnL in options app), and downloading some extra missing files (link in comments).\n- I highly recommend setting the control method to "E-mouse", with inverted Y-axis (Makes it behave like an FPS).\n\nIf anybody has any questions about how to get this game running, comment on my review your questions, and I might be able to help you with it. I'm running this on Windows 8.1, with x8 Anti aliasing at 1280x720@60 FPS and all settings maxed (Trying to figure out how to get 1080p, at the moment).\n\nTL;DR If you ignore the outdated visuals and the hassle to get it properly set up the first time, this would be a fun flight sim for you.","October 1, 2014","true","26.7"," 36 of 36 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","36","36","0","4"

The game features decent flight model which makes you feel of flight and inertion, advanced damage model, a lot of detailed ground, naval and air units and buildings with their own damage models. There many types of aicrafts and weapons to choose. The game is unique by being realistic at some point Sci-Fi vtol sim. The game locations is large, the whole continent is featured here.\nThe story/campaign is good, long and even non linear at some places, the fully and nicely voiced dialogues (yeah with yelling commander etc.) also.\nThe graphics of original Echelon (2001) was next gen for it's time, but in WindWarriors not really much changes.\nGame mechanics have a lot similarities to MechWarrior series just you control the aircraft there.\nSadly this game didn't got any sequels (forget about operation matriarchy) so the story is incomplete due publishers counted this type of games as not profitable.\nThere is campaign coop and nice multiplayer with gamemodes involving teamwork and just fun deathmach, the bad thing it was using Gamespy. (the russian comminity still run server, but it reqiure custom patches) Unlike most of harcore sim games this is easy to learn but hard to master, in multiplayer (really!). There more action than fight with controls of your machine.\nI would recommend this game if you like open locations, Sci-Fi VTOL, atmoshpere (in both meanings, game take place only on planet) some hard missions to challenge your skills, epic and dynamic battles and unexpected turns of a plot.","October 17, 2014","true","12.9"," 27 of 27 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","27","27","0","0"

The game takes a long time to open everytime you want to play... Screenshots doesn't work and the Steam Community doesn't work in game.\n\nPretty sure this is a very old game, I don't really understand what i'm looking at and i'm pretty sure only people that have played the game before will enjoy it.\n\nI strongly do not recommend to buy this game if you haven't played it previously and even if you did, keep in mind you will spend a good amount of time fixing the game. Don't even ask me how I did it, I don't remember, I've tried many fixes and reinstalled the game twice, there's tips in both of the games discussions forums but most of them doesn't work.","November 27, 2014","false","1.2"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","30","6","20","3","0"
