I enjoyed Planetary Annihilation despite its flaws during beta (such as poor balance and crashes). Launching planets into other planets, and shooting 50 nukes at once to completely annihilate someone was good fun, and things were only looking to get better, but once Uber out of nowhere decided to “release” the game, the fun was over.\n\n“So that’s it?” I thought, wondering where all the other promised features were. The game was still buggy, unbalanced, and far from complete, but Uber considered it a job well done. It wasn’t much later when Uber launched a Kickstarter for a new game, called “Human Resources”. They asked for 1.4 million dollars, and needless to say, it failed.\nUber went back to working on Planetary Annihilation, and made “Planetary Annihilation: Titans”, which adds some units and fulfills some more Kickstarter goals. This sounds good, until they remove the original game from the store, and put a 37€ (40$) price tag on it. It also got rid of all the negative reviews, so that must’ve been nice for Uber too. Anyway, free to Kickstarter backers, but not for people who bought the original during alpha (when the game costed about 90€ / 97,50$), or beta, who both instead had a temporary option to pay an upgrade fee of 14€ (15$) for what’s still less than what the original game should’ve been to begin with.\n\nNow the original’s back on Steam, for a whopping 28€ (30$), and the Titans version has a permanent option to allow you to upgrade for the original price, but you’re still going to be losing money on it if you buy the original first. If you’re still intent on buying Planetary Annihilation, buy the Titans version, but I recommend against it. The Titans version isn’t much better, and these devs aren’t to be trusted.\n\nStay away from Uber Entertainment.","January 25","false","133.4"," 383 of 409 people (94%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","94","383","409","9","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/voodoochilli/recommended/233250/","voodoochilli","PondscumThePurple","http://steamcommunity.com/id/voodoochilli/","36 products in account","(EDIT: This review has been quite popular [Thanks for that, by the way], and I feel that in the interest of fairness I should mention that I have not played the Titans expansion, and I'm not going to, such is my dissappointment with this game. But it does perhaps bypass some of the problems I have raised here, I just don't particularly want to waste my money on it.)\n\nI wanted so much to love this game. I'm a huge SupCom and TA fan, and this game looked like it was going to be the game that I was playing every day for the next couple of years. But after a while things were starting to look pretty bad, I came back online for the first time in a while to see if things have picked up. The game is still a very bland and repetetive experience. As an RTS all of the authentic strategy is in the first 5 minutes of each game, and then it's just who can push the most build capacity.\n\nSupreme Commander: Forged Alliance is, in my opinion, the best RTS game ever made. It's basic mechanics are excellent, the need for map control, economy management, unit management, tech management and intel are all closely interdependent, meaning that you're always INVOLVED in the battlefield even during the "quiet" stretches of gameplay. The available maps are excellent, and if you play on Forged Alliance Forever, a community maintained lobby with a competetive 1v1 ladder and public match service for casual players, there are stacks more to download. The game was also beautiful, with a good spread of aesthetically and strategically unique factions from the bread and butter "space marines" UEF, the intel oriented guerillas Cybran, the overrun focussed Aeon, and the tech heavy Seraphim. The game progression from opening to endgame is multifaceted and calls for real-time responses to your opponenents activity. To this day after 5 years of playing Forged Alliance if anybody tells me they're looking to get into a new competetive game I tell them to get FA. Similar things can be said of Total Annihilation, PA's other direct predecessor.\n\nPA takes the "massive-scale" RTS format, and turns the format into an (ironically) incredibly two-dimensional experience. The units are bland and there is no faction diversity, the game escalates quickly but when it gets to its peak it tends to degenerate into a massive drag, especially across multiple planets with player interaction at a minimum, with power plays limited to a very uninteresting blob vs blob. Defensive plays just don't mean much in this game after a point. Your point defence investments will be thrown out for the sake of producing ever more units in the ongoing drudgery that is the endless escalation in this game. It sounds and is pretty cool the first few times you play it, but then you have your 10th game, and you realise you're doing more or less the same thing you did in the last 9, except there's a lava planet in this system, cool! But aside from your units not being able to drive over lakes of lava, that means very little. it's just forced no mans land. Interplanetary warfare epitomizes this. Build lots of orbital defences, build lots of fighters and send them at your opponents defences, wait 5 minutes for the fleet to arrive, hope it works, maybe send some fabricators to teleport an army from your planet to that one. I've done it so many times and I just don't really want to any more.\n\nHuge scope for escalation in an RTS is cool, but you can't build a game on sheer escalation, which is what this is. There is no nuance, deploying a small force well is almost never going to make a game-changing difference, to the point where it's not worth trying, better stick to what you know. The learning curve is too steep as it is to try subtle strategies as a new player, and once you get to grips with the game you realise that there is very little to be done outside of beating your opponent in an arms race.\n\nThe game was released unready, and is just generally a very poor execution of a great concept, centred around a gimmick which doesn't come into play that often. My one hope for the game is that some modders come along and take the good (but extremely temperamental) engine and inject some life into it, the elements are there, but Uber half ♥♥♥♥♥ it, and just made the most nondescript RTS they could, and then made it really big and really long... and really ♥♥♥♥ing boring.","April 27, 2015","false","32.1"," 754 of 866 people (87%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","87","754","866","24","22"

PA:Titans eh?\nHow bout, ♥♥♥♥ you UBERent.\n\n-----------------------\n\nI truly love this game. It does have something great about it. So I am going to bash the **** out of it now.\n\nThis game could be so great, but sadly it just falls short.\nIf this was truly a hard working little indy dev struggling to make it in this world then I would not be writing the wall of text before you!\n\nI also understand the amount of hard work that has been put into the game of which a sizable chuck goes in credit to the actual fans and modders, since they are likely to make the game better than the people that actually earned money from it.\n\nPlanets? Flat, lifeless with a few cracks and if you are really lucky, you might get a raised platau a toddler could step down off of, and yet your giant commander cannot! Shoddy half arsed textures. Metal planets not looking metal at all. Strange knobbly mountains and bits that really, just get in the way of the already terrible pathing.\nControls? Buggy, not clear and needing work.\nBoats? Whats the point, seriously? Maybe to defend a base with but unless your world has half water, you wont be using them to attack... Seriously! Because you CANT!!!! You cat get anywhere near the enemy with your super slow, super useless ships.\nAgain, the aircraft are insanely overpowered. Yet they talk about balance issues with a unit cannon?!?\nNo shields. When you crowdfund a game, give the people the game they crowdfunded! Or was it "backed" or "supported", noone seems to make their mind up and as with every game nowadays there is an army of drones that make excuses for these sorry game designers making money off your backs.\nPeople have a right to be annoyed and to say it and to express ANGER at this kind of thing.\n\nAnd now, to rip Galactic war, the Single Player element of Planetary Annihilation.\n\nTerrible UI and genrally GW is devoid of feeling, story or substance.\nLimited things to do, getting the "cards" to upgrade generally needs work, more cards, variation, a real reason to play GW.\nYou cant move around at all on the game map. If you want to travel backwards past previously conquered planets on the galaxy grid you have to click each individual planet and click travel, agian and again and again and again and again. You think Im kidding? Ha!\nI know there is a "mod" to fix this map movement issue,!! made by the community !!. Lazy work letting the community fix your game. Lost respect for you guys after this. I shouldnt need a mod for a game to make it playable.\nButtons clunky, interface clunky, doesnt feel nice at all and sucks to be you if you get stuck on a 1v3 in the Galactic War when the enemy computer commanders can throw nukes at you from other planets but you cant even land on their planet which is heavily fortified with orbital units and air units and maybe some mostly useless land units. The reason you cannot land on a fortified planet is because all you can build is one unit type you use to travel between planets called the Atreus. This Atreus can only hold ONE unit at a time so if the computer has locked the planet down good luck getting onto it!!!\nI did actually get 200 Atreus loaded with T2 builders and tanks and land and get a portal up that had hundreds of T2 units that all swarmed thru as soon as it was built. I did this THREE TIMES to THREE PLANETS in ONE GAME. Yeah, it was satisfying but blow me down if it isnt a serious game flaw. Its not hard, its stupid and badly balanced and badly done.\n\nIs this game still in Beta? NO! but it should be.\n\n\nUpdate\n---------------------------\nI have to say, I just read that they only just fixed the save/load for skirmish.\nThats not a fully released game, thats a work in progress. I stand by what I said, this game is still in Beta. Im angry that the devs said it was done and v 1.0 was released when the game was clearly, oh my gawd so clearly not finished! and Im angry that the Devs went on to say (Im paraphrasing) 'we will only continue development if people keep buying the game' which, to their credit, they have and may yet save some meagre amount of grace. The flak that UBERent has come under is not unwarrented and Im far from alone in thinking this.\n\nI will take Plutons advice (formerly Arioch) and wait a few more months, Im too annoyed to re-assess it right now.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spazz676/recommended/233250/","spazz676","Jake from State Farm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spazz676/","122 products in account","Let me start by saying that I have been following this game from the beginning as a backer. To put this simply, I would not recommend this game in it's current state (release build 71544). To call this a final game is absurd and borderline insulting. Features are missing or not flushed out at all and I don’t just mean I don't like them.  For example:\n\nThere is no way to play this game in offline mode. This was promised from the beginning to be included "When the game is released". They lied. Also You cannot save a game so either be prepared to spend at very least 30 minutes of uninterrupted time on here or waste it when you have something unexpected happen.\n\nSingle player is useless, boring, and flavorless. Many of the games only redeeming features are not even included with galactic campaign, no super weapons here folks. And maybe I am in the minority here but I like singleplayer usually, there just isn't anything worth playing.\n\nThe games are hard to follow after you leave your first planet. Most of the time will be spent navigating the UI trying to make sense of the battle while you literally leave your other forces idle.\n\nOPTOMIZATION is nonexistent. I have a high end rig for windows and a top line IMac and neither of them can run this game without major lag, graphical tears, or in many cases crashes/screen blackouts. This is acceptable for a beta but not a final release.  And honestly the graphics are pretty boring to look at and I'm a fan of the cell shaded/cartoon look but somehow they managed to make that dull and not vibrant.\n\nThere are some small gripes I have with the game as well. First is the lack of "flavor". I feel like all the units are so bland and basic, and to make it worse everyone is using the same ones. I wish there was some way of differentiating the units per leader, or even take some cues from the terrible single player and limit the techs for each player to 3 or 4 cards to make games more exciting. That brings me to my last little gripe, bots vs land vehicles. There is almost no difference between the two gameplay wise, honestly what’s the point, maybe I am missing something here?\n\nSo unless something drastic changes don't waste your time or money on this game, I know I wish I hadn't.\n\nMy internet connection at time of review was roughly 7mb down 2-3 up, actual. Best I can afford and I would say better than avarage. Note: This is my actual number not the "estimate" that providers give you. (Welp, I'm an idiot. Actual numbers are 31 down, 12 up.)\n\nI will Update the review if anything changes.\n\n(UPDATE Oct. 7th)\n\nThey have announced a patch coming Oct. 9th that will bring offline play. I will be testing it out and update the review accordingly.\n\n(UPDATE Oct. 10th RELEASE BUILD 73737)\n\nSo far with the update they made adding offline support everything has been going smoothly (at least as much as before). There are still plenty of major bugs that can be really frustrating and even make the game unplayable at times. I am glad that so far they have stuck with PA and turned out this update. As of right now I still cannot reccommend the game, however.\n\nSome people have complained that my review doesn't take multiplayer into account much and honestly they are right. I dont like multiplayer in games like this, it all comes down to who can click faster. I thought it was pretty clear from my statments that this review is more for singleplayer or casual multiplayer people. Also once you are entreanched in seperate planets there is really no way to invade eachother so it ends up being who can make the most nukes first (or activate the deathstar-esc metal planet).\n\nI really hope this game grows on me, I love the concept, I also really want to back their new project Human Resources but I think I will hold off since this game left such a bad taste in my mouth, not only for Uber but Kickstarter in general (Kickstarters really dont have to provide the product to you at all, and that breaks no kickstarter rules).","September 9, 2014","false","26.0"," 2,926 of 3,746 people (78%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","78","926","3","7","90"

No\nWhat about later?    No\n\nWhy? It's unfinished, claiming to be a completed work when we all know this is still a beta. There's missing effects, units, customization and more. Saying that the game is ready to be sold, is rubbish, its not, they just needed another bulk of cash to carry on developing. Remember all this is just my opinion but it is based on facts that even recently have come to light.\n\n\nIn-depth information.\nGraphics: 3/10\nTo allow for many amounts of units on the screen at once, polygon-count has been shredded, where most units and structures appear extremely square-ish, textures also greatly simplified to a huge extent. It looks really bad. I think i appreciated Supreme Commanders dramatic wars a lot more because of the quality of the image and units. Advantage is, you dont need a mega-computer to run this game smoothly, but i still feel like the quality has been destroyed too far. Many negative points for many effects being completely missing from the game. Remember a planet colliding and blowing up in the trailor? theres no effect for that in the actual game...it's unfinished.\n\nSound: 3/10\nThe repeated low quality sounds become very overly repetetive, with all units in the game having nothing to say but a mechinical noise, where only the engineer tank makes any unique noises, and the weapon firing sound effects for all units feel completely impactless, there's no OOMPH! or quality. The orchestral music isnt so bad, but it is short lived as there is no variation or multiple tracks. EVERY game features the same, SINGLE interchanging track based on wether youre incombat or drinking a beer etc.\n\nGameplay: 2/10\nAfter all the wait and all the multipl intakes of cash Uber Entertainment conned out of us, we got scraps. Where in short, the person who Mashes the mouse button the fastest AND wins a Decision based Dice-roll, rather than the smartest and most strategic player is going to be the winner of the game. You cannot speed up and slowdown gameplay (like in Supreme Commander) to allow for real strategy, instead, the winning formulae is to build as much as you can, as fast as you can (mash that mouse button! yeeaah!) of something to Zerg rush your opponent in ALL games. There's no strategy whatsoever than 'Send units directly to enemy'. The ability to smash moons and planets together is broken, where even some games end with EVERYONE losing, because early in the game, your planet 'naturally' (not caused by players) smashes with another one before ANYBODY including hard AI has a chance to leave the planet...meaning the entire game was a pointless waste of time right from the beginning.\nWith Land > Sea > Air > Orbital >Artillery > Nukes > Forced Planetary destruction giving too many things to possibly build to defend against all of them, the whole games boils down to who plays the fastest from the beginning, and what choice or units you build at the beginning, in a Rock-Paper-Scissors-Stapler-Pencil-Rubber-Glue-EverybodyLoses  style gameplay.\nIn short, it feels pointless to play a game where you know who's won in the first 5 minutes. THERES NO STRATEGY HERE WHATSOEVER, it's all about mashing the mouse button.\nTerrible.\n\nOverall: 3/10\nThe idea of what this game can become, is fantastic, but it is greatly undermined by being unfinished, unbalanced, and not anywhere near ready for consumption, and currently not worth that asking price. My advice is to play Supreme Commander - Forged Alliance against AiX (super hard cheating AI) if you want 'actual' large scale war that involves STRATEGY in order to overcome a tough challenge. It breaks my heart as a massive fan and lover of the other 2 games to say it :(  This is not a RTS, just a button masher. AVOID.\n\nFeedback?\n1. Give people the option like in Supreme Commander to SpeedUp and SlowDown gametime. We all have different physical playing speeds and bodily/mental fingerclickin limitations. It's not skill or strategy (i cannot state that enough), Planetary Annihilation is just speedclicking in it's current state. Its like giving a button-masher the championship-title in a Street Fighter tournament, it just aint how it goes.\n\n2. Scale. Planets, are so small that it takes away the ability to create strategies on the ground level.\n\n3. Defenses.  Most turrets are pointless, they cannot stop much, and are too squishy. The most concerning defensive structure you gave us...is the wall...It is too easy to shoot around and many air units, orbital units and launchers and artillery and (long list of other things) simply ignore Walls. Remove these pointless walls that dont do anything, and replace them with Shield technologies.\n\n---UPDATE - 2014 9th OCTOBER---\nIt has been announced that Uber are teaming up with the creators of Super Monday Night Combat (another piece of unfinished junk) to create another strategy game, when this game isnt finished by a huge mile. Breaking their Kickstarter contract to complete what was stated they were going to do.\n\nAt this point i can sadly say that this is all just a money scam at this point, to rush out a crappy game using kickstarter even though they already have the money squeezed from the fans of Supreme Commander. This is just greed, and full corruption even below EA standards. THIS COMPANY IS SCAMMING YOU, AVOID ALL GAMES.\n\nUber Entertainment have gone very low into corruption. This game is nowhere near finished, and we the people are now being stabbed in the back after supporting their game with an unfinished product, and being shaked for more money on a new kickstarter for another game when they already have the money they robbed from you the fans.\n\nThere has been a great deal of drama over the internet on this, and i (once a hugely loyal fan) am saddened to have to agree...All trust has been lost, take my advice and do not do any further business with these swindlers. DO NOT FEED THEM MONEY ON KICKSTARTER. Its a scam, they already have taken tonnes of YOUR cash to be able to afford development of the next game. They want cash, for nothing.\n\nDiscluding the crappy campaign mode which only consisted of copy/paste skirmishes, this is what Uber Entertainment have done:\n\n-Stolen over $1.1 Million in Kickstarter Fraud.\n-Stolen (by leaked rumours) around $16 million from Steam/Game fans in sales of a broken & unfinished game that does not meet the Kickstarter declarations.\n-Abandoned the game to a small team to do patchwork, breaking their Kickstarter contracts.\n-Instead of using the stolen cash to develop the new game 'Human Resources' , setup another Kickstarter so YOU have to pay for it.\n\nExpect further fraud and broken contracts. This is large scale fraud that deserves headlines in every game magazine (where the hell are you guys...you call yourselves journalists?)\n\nUber Entertainment should be Boycotted.\n\n---UPDATE 22nd OCTOBER---\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/659943965/human-resources-an-apocalyptic-rts-game/posts\n'Human Resources' canceled, the fans responded with great power behind their lack of donations. Human Resources was boycotted & the fans have been given a slight piece of Justice.\n\nMay Planetary Annihilation now be properly developed on...probably not.\nEither way, they should be banned from using Kickstarter in the future for taking the money and abandoning the game before the contract was complete. Thats fraud on a massive scale that needs an appropriate response.","September 10, 2014","false","5.5"," 2,834 of 3,778 people (75%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","75","834","3","28","130"

They will keep working on it for quite a while, and some features are still coming, such as offline play, dynamic savegames via ChronoCam, and multi-monitor support.\n\nSome new release features include Gas Gians, orbital only resource planets, which can be mined for a massive boost in resources.\n\nAlso, metal planets can be turned into planet killing death stars via a new building, the Catalyst. It's an excellent game ending weapon that will keep everyone on their toes for sure, and changes the game dynamic quite a bit.\n\nArea commands and PiP windows turn the task of managing whole planets into a breeze, while units such as the stargate-like teleporter shows off how interesting solar system-wide warfare can be. Personally these are the features that "wow" me the most.\n\nMost importantly, the client side of the game has gone through massive optimisation work, with multi-threading and many other improvements that make it run smoothly on not-so-new systems.\n\nThe game has a single player mode called Galactic War, with procedurally generated galaxies, that are unique with every run. It's not perfect, but it's excellent fun for a first pass, with unlockable technologies, AI assisted sub commanders, that make every run unique and fun. And it will only get better once the updates start rolling. Improvements and a multiplayer version is in the works!\n\nIn summary, if you loved Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander, but would like to take it a couple steps further, this is a game for you.\n\n-----\nDisclaimer: As PA is in development, I will occasionally update this review to reflect the state of the game.","November 25, 2013","true","159.0"," 1,425 of 1,909 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","425","1","0","72"

Sure, it had its issues, but playing with and against friends would provide hours of fun. Unfortunately, that changed today- the TITANS 'patch' came out, with a load of new content, gameplay, everything needed to make this game amazing fun. It also came with a $39.99 price tag. Sure, kickstarter backers got it for free - and EA backers got it for about $15 - but the sheer gall of Uber to try to sell its game twice to experience the full game is unbelievable. It's not even selling the game twice, really, as the 'expansion' costs MORE than the base game. It's absurd. For people that haven't bought the expansion, an annoying splashscreen comes up at the title reminding you. That's like taking the middle finger they've already given their entire playerbase, and then shoving it down their throats. Do NOT buy this game. If you already own it, don't buy it again.

If you contest my veterancy please go look up OathAlliance on youtube. That is my channel and it chronicles some of my +100 hours in game.\n\n[Note]: I'm doing my best to keep this up to date with every major game update. It might be a little bit behind the current build however.\n\nKey Features(What makes it, it)\n- Planetary Combat - Why settle for flat polygon maps that block you from flanking when you can attack from literally any direction(except from underground)?\n- Interplanetary - When you lose one world move to another. War doesn't take a holiday as long as there's worlds to conquer!\n- Interplanetary Nukes - Enemy on an orbiting moon? Nuke him!\n- Planet destruction - Why spend hours nuking all of your opponent's bases when you can just destroy the whole planet?\n- Massive scale warfare - Tired of having that dinky little 1k unit cap? How about swarming your opponent with 10k of bots(game supports 10k doxen atm)!\n- Galactic War! - Now you can conquer the galaxy, one planetary system at a time!\n- Voiced Alerts! - Low on metal? A voice will let you know of that and any other important info!\n- More little things that would be a pain to write down -\n\nSo now you're like "That sounds cool! But, why isn't it like that? Where's all the cool stuff!?". Well, let us remember that this is Gamma not Gamma as in "almost done teaser demo like BF4" this is literally "We are throwing in tons of awsomely big features that we've been working on throughout beta".\n\nWhat's coming?\n- More units and buildings! - Over 50 units are supposed to be in the game not including a host of buildings to accompany them!\n- More gameplay features/UI updates/more game types! - It says it all!\n- Co-op galactic FREAKING WAR! - Say goodbye to those boring campaigns that take away half the fun items. Just destroy the galaxy over and over again for fun!\n- 40 Player Games! - Killing everyone you know in a 40 way FFA is BOSS!\n- Even more things that are small and not worth my time writing! -\n\nSo, the final question. Is it worth the $? Well, that would be up to you. I paid over $100 during the Kickstarter, I've been in since the ALPHA(people who'd like to challenge my veteran status can check out my youtube @OathAlliance) and it's been worth my money. If are willing to accept that it's not complete and that you get to watch it grow and become even better than it was before whilst gaming, then go for it. If you simply want a finished game with all the nice shiny features and polished gameplay, wait until release.\n\nI'm not here to tell you what to do. This is simply a guide to help you on your path.\n\nUpdates have added the following:\nMore Units: Flame Tanks, Gunships, Sniper Bots, with more coming.\nTeleporter: Insta-Transport to the other side(planets, bases, etc)\nArtillery acting like artillery: Up and over not straight.\nCheaper Units: More units, less nucks!\nOptimization: Particle effects are now GPU rendered!\nTransport Unit: Carry your units around like a pro.\nMain Menu UI update: It's SO pretty!\nMore social features: You can add friends!\n\nUpcoming in more updates:\nMore Aggressive AI: Stronger, faster, deadlier.\nGraphics update: Beauty just got more beautiful.\nBalance work: It's barely been done!\nOptimization: Always more work to do!\nUI updates: First pass of the second pass!\nBug fixes!: Uber hates bugs as much as we do, they're doing their best to squash the little buggers.\n\nMore to come...\n\nHelpful links:\nPA Forums: forums.uberent.com/categories/planetary-annihilation.60/\nPA Homepage: www.uberent.com/pa/\nMy Youtube with over 200 PA videos: www.youtube.com/OathAlliance\n\nIf this review was helpful please rate it up, if you didn't understand something or something was incorrect please leave me a comment so I can look into it.","November 25, 2013","true","10.2"," 901 of 1,209 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","901","1","0","9"

Taking over a continent with large scale armies was great. Watching hundreds of arrows arching into a tightly packed phalanx, breaking it up just before the distracting charge from your Swordsmen forced them out of position so your Cavalry could break through the side. What a game.\n\nI believe this is the next best thing. In terms of scale, it is crazy! Most matches have the potential to see orbital engagements, with Commander units fleeing the battle torn main planet in search of refuge. A nearby moon makes for a better base than the distant planet. Once secure, the moon is turned into a war factory, pumping out robots and tanks into a teleporter to be fed back into the foothold left on the starting planet. Then, just as your waves and waves of units seem to be breaking the enemy line of defense, they nuke your teleporter and push you completely off the planet!\n\nBut all is not lost... You move every construction unit into the production of Halleys - giant rockets that can move small planets out of orbit... All the while inter-planetary nukes harass your anti-nuke defense and orbital units flood into your atmosphere trying to break through. But you manage to hold on just long enough to finish building your Moon of Doom, and it is time to quickly flee with your commander to the unoccupied planet.\n\nNow comes the fun as your push the moon into a new orbit of the sun; one which intersects with the orbit of the home planet - now riddled with machines of war, eager to break out and destroy you. However, without a foothold on the moon, nor an attempt at collonising the distant planet, your enemy has no where to go, and can only watch as a multi million ton projectile, hurled through space, smashes into his base, obliterating the planet, triggering the destruction of their Commander unit, and knocking them out of the game.\n\nYeah it's fun :D I just need someone to play with :(\n\nMultiplayer is where it is at, as unlike most strategy games, you can play as the same colour, sharing controlling of the same units, as well as team up. What's more, unique game modes like 1v3v3v3 can be played due to the dedicated servers, whereby the aim of the game is to knock out the solo player who has a production bonus. Almost like a race to break into the fortress!\nWatch this if you need any more convincing! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UArrkWiwvE","February 5, 2014","true","24.9"," 482 of 633 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","482","633","0","17"

I can review this fine, completed, ineffable, incredible, exceptional and transcendental...sorry, sorry, that's my bad....I meant preposterous and laughable release yet again because, after the game got slammed by those of us who backed it in Early Access, got f*cked over, then the devs took it off Steam, then resubmitted it some months later so the ratings would be reset and they hoped for better reviews.\nAHEM\n\nThis release, despite what they may say, or what you have been led to believe, is NOT what the finished product was supposed to be, even WITH the "Digital Deluxe Commander Bundle" addition.  A large number of us bought this game whilst it was available through Early Access, (Yes, yes, I know, we're f*cking dumba**es for doing that), and were promised what seemed to amount to being a brilliant bit of software once they had finished it......However.....They decided to do half a job and then release that as a completed game.  It was not.\n\nThe extra units in-game that were promised suddenly weren't included anymore, neither were several other features.  So we kinda felt ripped-off, (quite understandably, I think), and watched in despair as the money we had poured into the development for this game through EA was, for all intents and purposes, basically stolen.  Yes, we had paid for the game so the money wasn't physically ripped from our wallets but the game that we got, after the devs decided to do their cash-grab, WAS NOT  in ANY  way whatsoever, the game that we were promised...So, yes, I think that basically amounts to theft, in my books.\n\nNow this is where it gets real good.\n\nHaving placed their many, many, many thousands of pounds/dollars/euros/whatever in their pockets now, this game was put on the "Ignore" list, and what happened then? What was it?? Oh, yeah, Planetary Annihilation: Titans was released.........and, oh, look at that!  The features and units that we were promised for this release are now being sold as a completely different game now, even though the only real differences are the features that we had their words were being included here.\n\nSo we have this game and we have the "different" version that is PA: Titans, the differences being that the extra stuff that is in Titans were promised for this release, yet they've chosen to release Titans as a completely separate and different game, for the full price again, despite the "extras" that would amount to a DLC, AT MOST  from other developers.\n\nWell, Uber, you f*cked us all royally and you didn't even have the courtesy to give us a reach-around while you were doing it!!  Devs like you are the reason that Early Access gets so much sh*t from people.  Hell, why didn't you just release a Unity pack as a full game and have done with it??\n\nSo, yeah, I'm a small, petty little man but if my review goes towards somebody thinking twice about buying this game, then I suppose that's some small consolation and I can rest easier knowing that I haven't got a chafed sphincter for nothing.\n\nSorry about the length of the b*tching but it had to be said","March 5","false","5.4"," 88 of 97 people (91%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","91","88","97","11","2"

To give an example, this game is said to be RTS. While by definition I suppose it is, the strategy element is the weakest simply because every game mostly consists of unit spamming. It basically just comes down to who can get the biggest army the fastest, and there are very few opportunities for tactical flanking, unit countering, etc.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin for this game (to me) was the Galactic Conquest mode. It sounded amazing and I was expecting something akin to Star Wars Empire at War. Instead it is quite literally nothing more than "exploring" a pre-generated map, and whenever you encounter an enemy force, you then have to fight it. There are no turns, so the enemy does nothing, and the only "strategy" involved is you having to choose which units you can build via which "techs" you hang on to (you can only hold three at the beginning). Oh and you don't research the techs, you find them on planets...\n\nAt any rate, I just can't give this game a positive review. It had the potential to be awesome, but I feel that it failed.","November 17, 2014","false","8.1"," 1,020 of 1,432 people (71%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","71","020","1","15","6"

The developer has shown their strong desire to continue patching them out, so for this reason i would now recommend the MULTIPLAYER experience.\n\nIf you are looking for a purely SINGLEPLAYER experience however, this is still a wary not recommend. The singleplayer is now definitely functional, alot less rng dependant, and you will more likely have the tools you need to deal with the situations you are put in.  However, the underlying gameplay will still quickly grow repetitive.  There is no compelling story, and the only difference from simply playing a normal AI battle is that you get cards which grant uninteresting number buffs.  e.g. x% more income, build power, damage.\n\n**Original review (please note, most of the bugs listed here have been resolved in patches since which I have marked with an asterix*)\n\n9 months after release, PA is still a not recommend in my books.  I love the game to death and will still continue to play it with the awesome community it has, but I just cannot in good conscience recommend it to others.  The game suffers from a multitude of longstanding issues including\n\n- Horrendous unit pathing*\n- Pages of unfixed bugs\n- Frequent crashes*\n- Basic functionality like attack move and unit target prioritisation doesn't work*\n- Undocumented ladder system\n- Lag and unresponsiveness issues throughout the menus and UI*\n- System designer is buggy beyond belief and the save button doesn't actually save anything.\n- Join game button frequently doesn't work*\n- Often serious lag issues when playing from AU to EU server and vice versa (you need to use the US server)*\n- Hardly any unit variety since tier 2 (50% of units) is horribly unviable\n- A terrible hotkey system design\n\nThis game is a very rough gem, and one of its main strengths is that there are talented modders in the community who put out fixes and other ease of use mods that you can get off the PA mod manager (another community tool).  An absolute must have if you decide to get this game.

It has had a rocky start and some people do have problems with even getting it to run properly without crashing. But it is getting better.\n\nThe latest version is by far the best version. The new balancing and tweaks for units make it so much better in many ways. Compared to a few months ago, when I bought it (oct 2014) it is much better. The fixes for stability and performance was really needed and can't be appreciated enough.\n\nThe future looks bright as the game continues to be developed and gain features and fixes. For those that want to play around there is an excellent tool for mods, PAMM (Planetary Annihilation Mod Manager). With that you can install, uninstall, update mods with just a few clicks. Mods range from UI tweaks and hotkeys to overhauls that change the whole gamebalance. Some even adding in new units.\nWell worth looking into even if you only want to add teamcolours to commanderexplosions.\n\nSo what is the game.\nWell it is a game where you balance economy with expansion while trying to stop you oponents to gain economy and expand. The goal is to defend and keep your commander alive while finding and killing your oponents commanders. Depending on what skillevel you land on you will find the game as a nice slow basebuilding excersise (not appreciated style in multiplayer ;) ), or a spamfest where the goal is just to outproduce you oponent and overwhelm them or, lastly, as toptier you will have a real good spamfest but also with an intense need for always making the most of everything. Meaning you will need to micro armycomposition. Making sure your anti-air isn't in the front getting slaughtered. Doing that in a couple of places is one thing now do it in up to ten places on a sphere. Then introduce more spheres, more oponents. It gets hectic, frustrating and really rewarding when you manage to have some control.\n\nThe game really scales very well to. You can play 10 people on a small planet and have an intence fight from start or you can play 2v2v2v2 starting on a planet for each team. It is up to what you and the ones you play with wants.\n\nThere is a 1v1 ladder that presses skill hard on those that need it. This is where you can see the balance of the game shine (or not :P). It is easy to get into and replays are available to study what the good players does that works.\n\nActually the replaysystem in it self can merit some mentioning. they call it ChronoCam. It makes the whole game into something that can best be compared to a videoplayer. Jump around, change speed and so on is all there. The really amazing thing is that while you play a game you can jump into ChronoCam anytime and rewind to see what you missed. Not something you will use often but still a fun thing.\n\nWhile 1v1 ladders rarely (never?) end up advancing the tech to tier 2  there is a largescale endtech war to be had. It involves planet vs planet where the goal is to get a beachhead with a teleporter to massinvade from you homeplanet. Or you could scout the location of the enemy commander and target the location with a nuke volley to punch through the anti-nuke defences. Just before christmas they also added the Unitcannon. Big artillery piece that lobs units to any place in the system with pinpoint accuracy. With it you can land a harassmentforce righ inside you enemy's base.\n\nIt really is a game that will reward those that embrace it. But it also isn't a game for everybody.\n\n\nAddendum 2015-05-25\nIn response to kwiksilver344's comment\n2 days ago they launched pte-82000 with way to much balancing tweaks and bugfixes to post here. One month between patches is comparatively high when it comes to games when they contain so much changes.\nYes the saves bit are bugged. Quoted from the pte changelog....\nOriginally posted by PA Forum:Saving a Galactic War game has not changed. Select Save Game (Beta), wait about 5-10 seconds, then exit out of the game. You can exit by selecting Quit to desktop.\nPlease note, selecting “Quit to Main Menu” will not save the game.There are sadly plenty of aspects of the game that could be described as underdeveloped. But for them to prioritizing the multiplayer aspect is only natural. That is where the game shines. The singelplayer bit (galaxy War) is very lackluster.\nI can also recomment cheking out PAMM (Planetary Annihilation Mod Manager). There are plenty of things to play around with including big overhauls that change the whole game around.\n\nPTE is a testbuild branch you can opt into via the the steam client. It is where new balance tweaks gets tested before hitting the live branch.\n\n\nAddendum 2015-06-13\nAs of writting the game has had an overhaul for the singleplayer content. It is much much better balanced and fun now. Still not epic but good enough for some fun. The game is still very much a multiplayer game.\nAnother addition is the functionality to use chronocam(replayfeature) to rewind the game and now resume playing from an earlier point of the game. (Button marked beta so it might need some more love)\nWorth mentioning is that by now there is also a save/load functionality in the game. Something a lot of players have been screaming for.\nThere are still those that have to make an effort to solve issues with drivers and such to get the game working. Most issues should be solvable though.","January 15, 2015","true","143.6"," 468 of 673 people (70%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","70","468","673","18","12"

If you enjoyed Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander this game captures a similar (note: similar, not identical) feel, but with a unique approch using spherical maps (you can have one or multiple planets)\n\nThe highlight of this game for me is playing with a group of friends in team games with shared armies.  I played a good deal of SupCom / SupCom:FA with friends and while it was fun, it just didn't capture the same feeling of team cooperation that you can get from sharing a single set of units working with your friends.  Shared armies lets you split up the management of the game by not forcing any one single person to keep track of everything (and in large games over multiple planets, this can be difficult)  Tasks such as economy expansion, scouting and raiding, orbital and multi-planet expansion can be split among teammates.  This does require a degree of cooperation as there is a single shared resource pool, but the benefits are well worth it.","February 4, 2015","true","381.5"," 249 of 369 people (67%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","67","249","369","10","0"

I'm a huge RTS fan. Planetary Annihilation has been on my radar for the past weeks. I was super excited for the game. As a huge Supreme Commander fan, I wanted something similar with different gameplay. For that point, I wasn't disappointed. You still have a commander and unlimited amount of units to your command. The scale is huge, which make the game more interesting. However, the game lack in terms of performance. I have a good rig, and I'm not shy against graphical settings. When you hit the thirty minutes mark, expect an immense drop in frame rates.\nHere's why: you are streaming the game. Your computer is never working hard. My graphic card usually make a bunch of noise due to heat (you get the point), but not with this game. The game needs to be connected to an ongoing internet connection. It destroys the entire experience. Each time you generate a game, you generate a server on the Uber service. When the action is getting high, the game is extremely slow due to poor server maintenance.  It's far from being DRM-free. You can't play offline. Nope. Never. Forget it.\nSo, you get the point: no servers, no game. It's simple as that.\n\nMy $60 experience so far was to explore the menu. My games are never loading up because the servers are not responsive. I was extremely excited about the game. I dreamed to play the game. Now, I have nightmares. If you want to play a new RTS experience, give it a shot. It is not that bad. I actually liked it, if I was able to play. Unfortunately, painful drops in performance and weird servers maintenance make the game not fun at all. Try it in a couple months. Simply hold your money for now, or buy Supreme Commander. After all, it is pretty much the same game, but with much more content (and yes, much cheaper).\n\nIf you're still skeptical about the performance you might get, go check it out on YouTube. There's plenty of let's plays. You'll eventually encounter - no, you will - bad frame rates. It's like getting a game but the engine is so poorly optimized that the frame rate is awful. You wouldn't get this game for that reason, right? Well, it's the same scenario here, but the cause is the Uber servers.","January 7, 2014","false","6.3"," 1,429 of 2,343 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","429","2","0","132"

But when I see hundreds of units blowing up other hundreds of units it is entertaining enough that it was worthwhile. It has a few balance issues regarding usefulness of units, just like how some units were in Total Annihilation, such as Naval being obsolete unless you start on a water planet and Orbital Defenses being spammed late game as the only useful defense since it covers both the Orbital and Surface without being easily destroyed.\n\nIt also has no unique feel to anything except the fact that it is the only popular-ish game that lets you watch hundreds of units just shoot and blow things up while being blown up. Total annihilation started the Macro Large Scale RTS genre and was quite revolutionary. Supreme Commander took Total Annihilation's gameplay and made it unqiue by giving Factions different strengths and weaknesses and a much more interesting storyline. Planetary Annihilation took Total Annihilation's gameplay and made it much simple, gave it a few twerks and just made it a game where you enjoy explosions and explosions. Just to make it simple:\n\nPros:\n- Simple.\n- Lots of Explosions.\n- Newbie Friendly.\n- Runs pretty well considering at times there is thousands of units.\n- Rather mod friendly in comparision to some other games.\n- Unique maps as well as a unique and confusing, at times, map creator.\n\nCons:\n- Buggy randomly.\n- Useless Units.\n- Unique Map system can be clunky and make some content obsolete .\n- Rather slow updates regarding basic game content, such as saving which hasn't been around for a while.\n- Stalemates happen a lot when players start on two planets.\n- Lack of variety in appearances, only Commanders have different models, the rest is done by team colour.\n- On low end systems, it can quickly become unplayable.\n\nBeta Review Below:\n\n" This game, currently in Beta, has been through a lot lately. I wasn't in the Alpha but I am in the Beta versions. It is a simple large-scale real time strategy ( or Large-RTS ) with a unique look and feel. Now I've always been a fan of Large RTS games despite the lack of them; Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander were the two Large RTS games I've played and enjoyed a lot, despite me not being the best at them. But comparing this game to those two, it is a lot smoother and easily more playable for newbies.\n\nThis game is worth while for those who enjoy large battles with hundreds of units and no unit capacity ( as of right now anyway ) and a lot of explosions. But sadly it gets repetitive as of right now with the lack of visuals and variety between units and structures. But many games suffer from that in the real time strategy genre during early development and such. Now in my opinion the price is a bit too high for what it would be sold as during release and I think it should be lowered down slightly, but I'm not in control of prices so I couldn't change it. Also currently the main way games are ended in certain systems are via Nukes and Planetary Annihilation without a way to disable either right now. You can remove all small planets but nukes still exist.\n\nFor visuals and audio this game is actually quite nice, even the explosions, it is unique and does well to follow the Total Annihilation way of keeping a player wanting to play the game over and over. Basicly right now it is a Total Annihilation game on a planetary scale but a lot smoother. I also wish to point out that it is quite demanding on your computer if you wish for a system with more then a few worlds, sadly. Sure some people would be able to run it but others may not and might have to stick to maybe a couple of worlds as ususal, which is currently the default.\n\nGalactic War was added with the Galactic War Update. It is more like a Skirmish against bots at the current moment of time with a 'turn' system in between battles and technologys. Really it isn't much more then that, so unless you find that interesting you might as well stick with Skirmish.\n\nSo I would recommend this game but you have to remember it is in Early Access and isn't completely finished, it needs more units and structures currently and the developers are trying hard to please a large variety of players. So if you would enjoy this kind of game go ahead and buy it early or wait till it is finished.

Given some of the design decisions, I'm not sure it will ever be what fans had hoped for.\n\nThere are still fundamental stability bugs -- the game will simply lockup for no apparent reason. On a high-end game pc, even on the lowest graphics setting, the game will sometimes slow down to a point of unplayability. There is no story in single player, and no meaningful variation in the planets -- they look slightly different but strategy is fundamentally the same. The AI is weak.\n\nI could go on. For example, there are a handful of high end units that completely destroy game balance. Without certain other high end units you *cannot* win. There are strategies that will insure complete deadlock.\n\nAfter sticking with it for all this time, this is very disappointing.","April 15, 2015","false","198.6"," 67 of 95 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","67","95","0","0"

I don't think I will play it again for quite some time.\n\nEdit: after having returned to this review a little more level-headed, I have decided to err in favor of a positive review. I have added some positive points below.\n\nEdit 2: I apologize for how long this review ended up being. I also just saw how many hours Steam has logged for me playing PA. This is partly due to what I mention in bullet 2.\n\nYes, I am writing this after just being completely hosed in my one and only multiplayer, ranked 1v1 match. Yes, I am writing this after coming from having been recently annihilated on my very last battle in the Galactic War I was in (the furthest I had ever gotten up to that point). Yes, I'm not by any stretch the greatest RTS player out there (but I really thought I was getting the hang of PA after several hours of play). And yes, I'm probably not in the best frame of mind to write an unbiased review. Still, for now, I'm sticking to my opinion above. Let me tell you why:\n\nThis is not a casual game. There is no Easy Mode.\nFor some games, that is okay.  Some time ago,  I reviewed FTL: Faster Than Light. In FTL, the fact that there is no easy mode is okay because, while it is difficult, all you really need to do better is know how to plan upgrades and know when to pause during a fight (hint: very often). With those two skills, and a measure of patience, your only really challenging enemy is bad luck. In a game with no significant curves thrown at you, you can work through it without a ton of effort most of the time.\nThis is only kind of true with PA. In PA, you either do the right thing, maximizing productivity all the time, or lose (and in the case of a Galactic War - permanently). There's very little room for error. Really, the only way to win any fight is to pause often and issue several orders at once. Otherwise you are just going too slowly to keep up. While this is not always a bad thing, I feel it is a little inappropriate for a Real-Time Strategy game.\nWith the tech options at your disposal, there are often only a couple of paths you can take to success. If you can build a vehicle factory, do it right away and pump out tanks and AA. If you have air factory tech, focus even more on that and pump out bombers. Always play offensively; there is no such thing as a defensive win unless you already have a serious advantage. Don't interrupt the natural progression of building - make cheap units and buildings first until you have a lot of excess metal and energy. Trying to shoot immediately to an advanced factory, as I have often tried, always fails. Expand as fast as possible, across your start planet and to other planets. In the endgame, metal is always your most restrictive resource, so grab as much as you can as early as you can.\nWhen you are able to do it right and win, it is a satisfying win. But in the final battles of a Galactic War, you already start significantly overwhelmed, meaning you have to take out as many commanders as fast and early as humanly possible or you lose - badly.\nThere is no way to save and return to a fight - so they always have to be finished in one sitting, or paused and left running.\nNow, I have read somewhere on the forums that is mostly because the developers have to do more optimizations on their end to have the ability to save games using the Chrono Cam, which is basically a replay feature very similar to what you find in the Dirt racing series (or at least Dirt 2). The idea is that, when fully implemented, you can open a saved game (or the one you are in) and rewind/fastforward to any point you choose, and pick up right where you left off. While this will indeed be a very cool feature when implemented (it's one of the things that really sold me about Dirt 2), it doesn't make up for the fact that currently there is no saving at all, not even a stop-gap feature until the Chrono Cam saves are done. This seems like a pretty basic omission to a game not still in beta.\nThere are still some aspects of actual play that feel unfinished. One of the larger examples is planet-smashing. While I have not yet smashed a smaller planet into a larger one (to supposedly achieve the crater effect shown in the promo video), I have successfully smashed some fairly equally-sized planets together - and the resulting animation is completely underwhelming. The attacking planet approaches along a path that often has several unrealistic jerks, it lines up with the target, and runs into it. That's pretty much it. There's no planet-crumbling explosions that shatter it into a thousand pieces or widespread surface deformation as they collide. The model for the two planets simply overlap breifly until they each reach the other's core, and then both instantly disappear. The only evidence that planets once existed there are the mushroom cloud(s) of whatever commander(s) you destroyed still billowing up from the invisible surface of a now non-existent planet.\nOther smaller issues:\n- The relatively small number of structures and units. This would be different if there were some faction-specific units with differing strengths/weaknesses. Right now, the only difference between two armies' units is their color.\n- The pause screen banner has an invisible no-click zone above and below it, requiring repositioning the camera until the desired selection is in the bottom or top quarter of the screen before you can click it.\n- Sometimes after selecting a group of units, the arrow keys stop working; so that you must first deselect the units, move the camera so that you can see the units and the target, then selecting the units and issuing the order.Also, in case you are wondering, I always play with the maxed out ("Uber") graphics preset and can still get a good framerate, so that is not the issue.\n\nOkay, with those negative points out of the way, here are some positive ones:\nThe general idea behind Planetary Annihilation is certainly ambitious and, if successfully fleshed out, will be totally awesome.\nPA is still a pretty solid RTS. Play on a single planet feels like it should for any standard RTS (my opinion from my perhaps limited experience).\nInterplanetary gameplay adds a whole new dimension to an otherwise well-explored genre.\nKill your opponents by blowing up their planets. Make it a destruction by collision with another massive body, or with a frickin' laser beam, Death Star style.\nIf planet destruction isn't your cup of tea, then you could try a much more subtle death-by-bajillion-nukes. The mushroom clouds are quite pretty.\nIf that's still a bit strong for your taste, then there's always the classic invasion-with-hundreds-and-hundreds-of-units method.\nThe community seems to be a good one, and the developers do interact and take feedback on the forums.\nUltimately I decided to mark this a positive review, but only just. As I said above, PA can be very frustrating for several reasons, but that is at least partly balanced by how unique it is, and how awesome it has the potential to be.","January 30, 2015","true","81.1"," 137 of 221 people (62%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","62","137","221","10","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chrismohr/recommended/233250/","Chrismohr","Chrismohr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chrismohr/","773 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis review is relevant as of 25/06/2014 using version Galactic .67523\n\nGameplay\n\nThe Gameplay for Planetary Annihilation consists of having a commander that is dropped on a planet, and having to build up your base, carefully managing an economy so that you don’t expand too quickly or too slowly, while building a massive armada of troops that you will use to help annihilate your enemies.\n\nA match takes place across a solar system and depending on what kind of solar system you are fighting on (does it have moons? How many planets? Etc) it drastically changes what kind of tactics you will have to use and what kind of approach you need to take to beat the enemy.\n\nFor fans of Supreme commander this game will seem extremely familiar, with some of the supreme commander team being behind this game, it retains the feel that supreme commander had and most importantly it does not dumb down itself for the masses, it retains a great deal of complexity while accurately achieving the “easy to learn hard to master” feel.\n\nYou will have to manage orbital, aerial, naval, and land troops to achieve victory. This can be slightly overwhelming when you are managing multiple planets and is the only downside to the Gameplay. But if your cup of tea happens to be managing a massive amount of troops in a gigantic scale then that will not be a downside for you.\n\nIn the multiplayer side of things you can have multiple people playing as the same faction, or being able to command each-others armies. This means you can have a 3v1 against the computer (who of course can manage all their troops no problem) and have a challenging time. The resources are balanced depending on the breakdown of the teams, so if you are 3 v 1 the 1 will get a 3x resources boost to keep things balanced.\n\nI give Gameplay a 9/10 only losing 1 point for sometimes being difficult to manage the scale of things, but I stress that this is personal preference and that I know other players who enjoy this aspect very much.\n\nGraphics\n\nGameplay is a much more important aspect of a game for me than graphics. But those who have a much higher standard for graphical fidelity will not be disappointed. The game looks fantastic and the planets are visually pleasing, the graphics are as realistic as they need to be while retaining a very high quality look about them.\n\nThere is not much more I can say about the graphics other than they look fantastic, the game can sometimes slow down when there is a large system with a lot going on (this game is demanding on your system specs) but overall this does not detract from Gameplay. With it being early access there is still optimisation to be done so the finished product will run a lot smoother.\n\nI give graphics a 9/10 only losing out to slowdowns when there is quite a large amount going on it a system.\n\nBalance\n\nThe game balance is still somewhat lacking in most departments, although the developers have made some passes at correcting the game balance it is still unbalanced in many aspects.\n\nIn multiplayer some units get neglected in favour of others because they are far better than their same-tiered counterparts which should not be the case. The units should each fill in different roles and have different strengths/weaknesses rather than just an overall better feel to them.\n\nGalactic warfare needs some more balancing on its technology side of things before it is an acceptably balanced game mode. With the locking away of certain technologies, some things become completely uncounterable and the player cannot even choose to branch out into these technologies that can counter the enemies due to the strange RNG system that the developers have went with for Galactic warfare.\n\nI give balance a 5/10, for the most part the balance is acceptable and the game is playable, the galactic warfare drags this down quite significantly but the multiplayer experience is not detracted (simply because people tend to use the same overpowered units and it cancels out)\n\nBugs\n\nBeing early access it is natural to expect bugs therefore I will not go into many details about the bugs that are In the game and only briefly cover the current state of the game\n\nThe game as it is right now is surprisingly bug free, some things such as the pause button going off the screen and the game not connecting to the game servers (which you NEED to do to play the game at all) can be very irritating, but the support for the game is good and the developers have a good track record of swatting bugs as they come up with frequent updates.\nThis section does not get a score, simply because it doesn’t seem appropriate to put this into the averaged score at the end of the review being that it is early access.\n\nOverall\n\nOverall I think if you like supreme commander, and you want a game that feels like what supreme commander 2 should have been like, you should most certainly buy this game. In early access it is already extremely fun and playable with a great community and vibrant multiplayer.\n\nWith offline play coming up soon the issue of having to play it connected will no longer be a problem, which was one of my major gripes with the game at first.\n\nOverall this game gets an 8/10 from me. Very worth the £10 I spent on the steam sale for the game and most certainly worth the full price as well.","June 25, 2014","true","29.6"," 145 of 236 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","145","236","0","0"

Now instead of players ostensibly watch dogging developers, it'll be plebs vs elites based on who paid uber more, with each pleb having to decide if they want to pay to keep previous gains in the form of paying the new entrance fee, or walk away from the game entirely, in either case providing a win for the elites and uber. Uber because they would certainly rather have a concentrated base of high and frequently paying players who are eager for any form of fiscal/development abuse.\n\nAnd elites because they would rather be surrounded by people patting them on the back for over paying as if having disposable income is a character virtue.\n\nI suppose I should thank uber and their whiteknights for sparing me future hours of modding frustration.

It's set in a non human galaxy where robot commanders have to regain power by building up their base and army to annihilate the other commanders. The special thing about PA is the "map" is a galaxy and you play on whole (3D)planets and not only a (2D)square map. You can choose if you want to fight on 1 or many planets. Also there are no limitations, neither in the amount of buildings nor units. But beware, if your commander dies your whole base will, too. If you like C&C / Dune / Starcraft / Total Annihilation...

It was also released too early, in my opinion, since offline was not included among other reasons. However, offline mode is now a part of the game in the latest beta build, and should be added to the main build within the next 24 hours.\n\nOverall, this is a seriously fun game that breaks new ground in the RTS genre. On these spherical maps, you can be attacked from any direction. On the flip side though, you can use this to your advantage to pull off sneak attacks from an unexpected vector. Orbital play and the ability to move between planets adds yet more depth and complexity.\n\nI have heard other people complain about the controls, but for the most part I find them adequate. You can assign control groups to make selecting specific armies easier, as in most good RTS games. The current hotkey support is limited, but you can download the "Hotbuild2" mod using PA Mod Manager to assign hotkeys to build specific structures and units. Camera anchor points let you jump to saved locations at the press of a key.\n\nGraphical performance was great for me on my Lenovo Y410p laptop with the GeForce 750M, 8GB of ram, and Core i7-4700MQ 2.4GHz processor. I rarely had any graphical glitches. If you are having performance trouble, the first thing you need to do is update your graphics drivers and make sure PA is using discrete as opposed to integrated graphics if applicable.\n\nThe AI features four difficulty levels, and is a competent opponent to fight if you aren't comfortable with PvP play.\n\nNow, on to nitpicks. The biggest issue I see right now is naval balance. Although it has improved markedly, naval pathing is still a bit buggy. Naval units in general are too slow, and don't provide enough bang for their buck. An expensive ship can quickly be demolished by a handful of tanks. Targetting of ground units is also poor. Orbital units ought to be a bit more varried, and I wish there was a multi-unit interplanetary carrier. Teleporters are a bit too easy to set up. I'd rather have to land a small army with a transport to secure a beachhead, and then set up a teleporter for reinforcements. Overall, I think there need to be more and more specialized units.\n\nAside from all that, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. You can ♥♥♥♥ing crash moons into planets, blow planets up with death star lazers, fill the skies with nukes, send nukes between planets...you have to play it to get it.\n\nA quick note on offline play, just released in the latest beta build. I tried it and it was completely stable. Uber recommends you don't play offline without 4 cores and 8GB of ram, but I was totally fine, at least in a 3 player game, with 2 cores (phyical cores, I don't know if logical cores count).\n\nSeriously, buy this game!","October 9, 2014","true","112.2"," 78 of 125 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","78","125","0","0"

I see a lot of reviews that have to do with the Kickstarter, or the "expansion pack". I was *not* involved with the KS, and I don't have "Titans". This is just pure PA.\n\nNumber 1 best thing: Engagement!\nOnce the game starts I do not notice the passage of time, I get so involved with building my units and economy.\nThe unit and structure build-times are very well balanced.\n\nAfter a while, though, gameplay does get repetitive. Build economy, build massive force, rush enemy commander, game over. I have gotten to a point where I can always win on "hard", but I can't keep up with the next-higher difficulty.\n\nSomething really impressive about it: Scale!\nYou can go from viewing a few little marching robots all the way out to the orbit of multiple planets.\nSometimes you even have to get your forces from one planet to another, and manage armies on multiple worlds simultaneously.\n\nSomething else I like is the fact that you can play a 'galactic conquest' mode, where there are multiple star systems on a map, and you have to conquer each system individually, *and*, each time you win a fight, you collect a special new technology that you can use in your future fights in this campaign.\n\nGlitches / bugs: Very few, none that are game-breaking.\n\nPerformance: runs fine on my gaming computer. Did not run at all on my previous machine. I think it's pretty hardware-dependent.\n\nGraphics: very impressive. But this is about the least important thing to me as a gamer. I almost always view the units as "icons" instead of "models".\n\nSound: excellent, really top-notch.\n\nMusic: also good. Gets a bit repetitive when you start a lot of battles, but you get into the game and it just becomes a nice background.\n\nUser Interface: excellent. Very many 'convenience options' for managing your forces.\n\nOverall: Highly recommended.","February 4","true","47.3"," 35 of 50 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","35","50","4","0"

I'm sure I am not the only one spotting those unbalance issues. how is possible the commander does not have a way to build an anti orbital missile from level 1? just broken... there are thousands of way to invade a panet I know, yet, if the planet is in total control of the AI you need advanced technology. this game is a race, and the only way to win is to destroy the AI immediately in less then 10 minutes or he will overwhelm you from multiple planets. if you are so good with AI, put some automation on the base production, to avoid getting stuck on the micro management and focus on the strategy, you cannot compete with the CPU speed on micro management. I am very disapponted... I want a serious campaign, not that crap mode of galactic war.","April 12, 2015","false","17.4"," 38 of 56 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","38","56","0","0"

As a big fan of Total Annihilation back in the day i can happily say that I'm not disappointed by Planetary Annihilation, it is a good quality successor and if you enjoyed TA then this should take you back.\n\nThere are some minor balancing issues [bit of a noob comment from the time of review, the game seems fairly well balanced, however i'm sure it'll be tweaked further] but this should be fixed in future patches. The gameplay is fun, very fast paced and the strategy is more than deep enough to make wins satisfying but not so overly complex that it becomes tedious or unappealing.\n\nI have a feeling that some of the negative reviews and complaints about the strategy elements are down to a lack of a tutorial which is a shame. The game doesn't have lots and lots of units and buildings and no tech upgrades and so forth but in my opinion that's a good thing, it's much more about map control and resource management, it is essentially quite simple but that forces a purer form of strategy from the player who must think and react very quickly and creatively.\n\n+Enjoyable strategy.\n+Nice clean simple graphics.\n+Enjoyable 1v1 ranked matches.\n+Seems to be a fairly good community.\n+Can be very fast paced and fun 10 to 30 min battles, or longer more epic matches if desired.\n+Now very reasonably priced.\n\n-Some balancing issues. [Not really an issue currently]\n-Developers apparently not very active.\n-Not many units, a flame tower for example would be nice and i'm sure there are a few simple additions which would spice up gameplay quite a bit.\n-No tutorial.\n\nMy hope is that patches will polish the game further because it's very close to being excellent in my opinion and a worthy TA successor.\n\nP.S. I would highly recommend downloading PA Mod Manager where there are some very useful mods which help aid the controls and gameplay. Also, read the guides on the steam community page which are a good tutorial substitute to help get you started. Oh and check out Zaphodx on youtube to get an idea of competitive online play!","November 26, 2014","true","194.2"," 188 of 323 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","188","323","2","5"

I know its not a direct successor but to me it is. A lot of the game mechanics feel like they are straight from the 90's. The way you harvest metal and energ. The way you build buildings its all just great.\n\nPositives:\n-You can slam planets into other planets\n-You can build up some crazy armies in ludicrously short periods of time\n-Smart graphics. Its definatley a different style to your normal rts but I really like them\n-The games with 5 or 6 players are just bonkers!

Everybody wins.\n\nNegatives:\n-Compared to TA it feels like there is a lack of units\n-Sometimes the AI goes into "fail" mode and just sucks ♥♥♥\n-The camera is somewhat fiddely but bareable\n-THIS IS MY BIGGEST NEGATIVE- Planets and moons share the same orbit\n\nOverall its a great game and I dont know what all the complaints and negatives are doing here. No, there isnt a tutorial but has this generation of gamers really had their brains melted out of their noses due to radiation and cod smack talk so much that they either cant work it out for themselves or use google?. It doesnt take a genius to work anything out the only thing i had to check online was some of the camera work.\n\nYOur commander builds your basic stuff, your basic stuff builds advanced stuff and your advanced stuff does advanced stuff...stuff.

In the end, I am very disappointed since it is basically a skirmish RTS against one or more brutal AIs, even in the early campaign mode. This in combination with a messy unit overlay system could be so much improved by implementing a short story embedded in a tutorial setting, but I wouldn't count on it to happen.\n\nOn a personal level, I prefer to build up a base at my own pace and then start exploring. If you do this, you will quickly get overrun by the enemy AI since he already built up a lot of factories and covers nearly all resources on the map.\n\nAll in all, a grand disappointment compared to the previous series.

However, I'd implore you to hold off on buying this game until it's fully released and functional, as there are some major and some lesser balance issues aswell as performance issues with the game as it stands. Also to add to that is the current hefty price-tag (heavily reduced as of right now!).\n\n\n(Slightly) Updated - 3rd of March -14.\n\nAfter having been criticized that I didn't specify enough, I've decided to complete this review.\n\nWell, I must say, this game is getting better and better, albeit I do not know the recent changes they've made as it was a fairly long time ago since I played it last, but at that point, when I played it, the major imbalance issues I'm talking about is just swarming tanks which is pretty much unstoppable, should you not strike back with the same coin, which, honestly, makes for pretty tasteless gameplay. I prefer something grander, such as attaching a bunch of huge thrusters onto a planet and then proceeding to crash one planet into another, for instance, is really awesome in my honest opinion, much better than just massing a bunch of basic tanks (not even upgraded ones) and zerging your enemy. This really is just my point of view on this though.\n\nAs in regards to the performance issues, it might have been just my old system at the time (Five year old motherboard+processor), but I was getting really heavy lag once alot of units started popping up on my screen, which really is a problem when paired up with the massive zerging of the tanks as I spoke about earlier.\n\nAnother concern that I remember was bugging me a whole lot was the camera being a bit clunky. I remember having a really comfortable camera position where I build my starting base based off of, then I zoomed out to see the other planets, rotated the camera abit, then decided to return to my base, only to be greeted with an alien base that didn't at all look like mine. It was a bit of a hassle to get the camera back to normal, and I, ultimately, lost a fair bit of time because of it. But I guess that's the type of problems you run into when creating a game of this scale.\n\nAll in all, I can really see great potential for this game, the concept is awesome, I really like the artstyle, and it's just an overall enjoyable game, and with the sale bringing it down to, what, 27.99€, it's definitely worth buying because of the potential alone.\n\n7/10","December 22, 2013","true","20.8"," 133 of 228 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","133","228","0","6"

Unfortunetly it is not:\n\nWhile adapting many mechanics from games like Supreme Commander it leaves out crucial content that is just needed in this type of game. Unlike SupCom, you only have one faction to choose from wich makes all matches look the same, apart from the colors you get to choose. A lot worse is the fact, that due to the lack of content there is only one playstyle, wich makes all matches play the same.\nRemember SupCom: Forges Alliance? How you had mutliple ways of winning? Build a small easy to defend base, while upgrading to tech 3 as fast as possible and nuking the ♥♥♥♥ out of everyone ?\nOr slowly capturing more resource nodes until you defeat the enemy by the sheer size of your army? Harassing the enemy with smaller units while building the big gamechangers, experimentals?\nWell, in Planetary Annhilation there is just ONE, agressive expansion. Why just one? Because there are no tech levels (apart from a simple 2 category system) no shields, no stealth units/buildings, no experimentals, and so much more (or less).\n\nAnd while castrating the mechanics of its predecessors, it adds nearly nothing to the concept: The planet system is just annoying and pointless since the battles only take place on the surface of the planets, the planets are way to small in comparison to units and buildings, they are all flat and act the same.\nOne postive thing i enjoyes were the graphics, the comic artstyle is nice.\n\nBut the graphics cant outweigh the lack of content, annoying controls, monitony of the battles.\nThe game just feels unfinished and the few small updates that Uber published changed little to nothing at that.\nThis is like getting promised a live dinosaur, but getting the painted bone of one.\nAnd instead of bringing more and more relevant updates, uber publishes a standalone "expansion" for 37€ ?!\nThis is what offends me the most, not just selling a unfinished game, but capitalizing on the supposed expansion, flipping everyone off who baught this version.\nI have not and will not play the expansion, but i doubt it will fix the the problems this game has.\nIf you have played SupCom: FA, keep playing it and stay away from this offal.\nIf not, pick it up for 10€ and stay away from this offal.","August 18, 2015","false","13.5"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Don't bother with this game before 6 month unless you really want to give the developers some additional money to finish their game.\n\nThis is indeed what this is all about : they didn't get enough money to finish the game with their kickstarter. I backed them but I hate the way they are using early access now to grab some more. At least, if the price tag was not so high, I could understand, but this is just unacceptable.\n\nAnd it's even on sale as if it were a finish product... Seriously Valve, stop this nonsense and try the games you propose in early access and limit this feature to the ones which are actually in beta stage and not alpha, or set a price tag for alpha stage that is lower than the price of a finished product : you will do everyone, dev and customers, a favor. If the dev don't agree with a reasonable price, prevent them the early access possibility, that's all there is to do. This would avoid so much bad advertizement for games that can't afford a bad reputation before they are solid enough.\n\n\nHere are my advices if you are interested in this game:\n\n1. grab a copy of Supreme Commander Forged Alliance. Even at full price, it's 10 €, and it's leagues ahead of Planetary Annihilation in all areas (factions, variety, gameplay, depth). 10 dollars for a rich, polished, finished product compared to 55 € for a clumsy, unoptimized, half baked product. PA is a huge step backward among RTS of its kind, it's even less interesting than Total Annihilation with community improvements and it's as if Supreme Commander never existed and didn't improve the TA formula. The better game is already out, no need to play the less interesting one at the moment.\n\n2. Have fun with Forged Alliance until Uber Entertainement actually finishes their game and enter beta stage (i.e. with full features, only balance changes and fine tuning remains)\n\n3. Give PA a try only once it reaches a true beta state, or even wait for release. Only then will it be able to even start to compete against Forged Alliance, but I'm very pessimitisc about its appeal over time (only one set of units is boring, when the gameplay itself is already boring). It looks to me that it will be a nice little game, fun for a while, and that I won't want to play for a long time (I currently don't feel like palying it at all).\nThe only new feature is spherical maps (planets), but I feel like it's more a gimmick, and it feels to me more annoying than really enriching for gameplay.","December 27, 2013","false","2.7"," 549 of 979 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","549","979","0","32"

An im sure that everyone who wanted to play this with all there friends will be even more disapointed. I can't stress enough that it makes the game unplayable. Freezes for up to 2 minutes, slow downs constantly on large systems. CONSTANTLY. Your game will be unfrozen for like 20 percent of the game. It's a real shame they decided to release it like this.\n\nThere are couple little small bugs here and there. One of the more annoying ones is when a "phantom" building is stuck to your cursor. When holding shift to build multiples of buildings ive noticed it to stop working and then just leaving the building on my cursor doing nothing. So I have to click off my unit and click a different building to build to get it unstuck. Just minor bugs that also should have had fixing before the release.\n\nTL;DR - Game sufffers from game breaking slow down due to their servers, UBER seem like a great dev company so just wait this out until it's fixed, then buy it.","September 5, 2014","false","24.6"," 187 of 328 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","187","328","0","0"

They released another one under title Planetary Annihilation: Titans which is essentially a copy-paste of this game with some patch and Titan units as extra. Devs only care about money not the player, so don't give them anymore money, I am regret to buy this uberCr@p.\n\nGame Review: The game itself isn't that bad, its buggy but its still playable (atleast for me in the past), the concept of this game is really good, but devs ruined it and literally giving cr@p to consumer by releasing identical game and charging it for full price game. Why devs not release Titans as add-on?? why they abandon this game??.\n\nBack to game review, the gameplay is pretty decent, you can control huge amount of unit on a planet and try to annihilate enemy, unit type also quite variable however most of the time you only spam 1-2 type unit since other type is useless, and mixing unit isn't really effective (maybe because I am bad with micromanagement?). The coolest part of this game is blasting your enemy with an asteroid, but it gets boring after 2-3 try. Honestly I would give 5-7 out of 10 for game, however devs don't care about player, they only want more money.\n\nSCORE : 2/10 VERDICT: DON'T BUY ANY KIND OF GAMES FROM UBERCR@P ENTERTAINMENT.\n\np.s = Sorry for my horrible english","August 28, 2015","false","6.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

The armies - all robotic in nature - can be churned out at an amazing rate, growing into vast hordes; the maps are solar systems, complete with moons and planets, all gently spinning and circling their suns; and the devastation is on a scale that should be obvious from the title. It could have been great. A new, bigger Total Annihilation or Supreme Commander.Strategy games, or indeed any game with a substantial amount of depth and complexity, require a bit of education. It begins in the game: tutorials, detailed tooltips, campaigns - the things that teach you the basics.Planetary Annihilation skips the first part entirely, expecting players to dig their own way out of confusion. This makes one’s introduction to the game an unpleasant one, but when that first commander lands on its first world - it’s impressive.The commander makes planetfall, announcing its arrival with an imposing explosion. In a game that’s a race to the eponymous planetary annihilation, the lumbering commander is a liability, needing to be protected by an army. A swarm of enemies could take it out and spell the end of the game.Gargantuan armies can be constructed with surprising speed, and with new factories comes the ability to build fabrication units - more builders - with their much larger repertoire of blueprints.There’s a satisfying cadence to the unlocking of new toys.That first few games you are entertained with spectacular, planet-killing explosions and nuclear extinction. But eventually the unpleasant flavours are reached. Races can be fun. They can be intense, focused things, too. But they are also exhausting, and Planetary Annihilation never stops being a race. Defensive plays take a back seat when you can weaponise whole worlds. In multiplayer, victory goes to whichever player can click fastest and most consistently. Navies get ignored because the tiny oceans serve no purpose and you can just send aircraft over them, and spacecraft are equally limited. Space in general is no fun. It’s somewhere to travel through, and that’s not very interesting at all. When a match reaches the point where players are buggering off to other worlds, it becomes a micromanagement nightmare. Everyone’s playing with the same tools, as well. There’s only one faction. The question of balance has always been important in the realm of the RTS, and Uber Entertainment’s answer seems to be: make everyone play the same way. The Galactic War mode - Planetary Annihilation’s single-player mode is exceedingly bland. There’s no story, no real context and the AI can be abysmal at times. There are rough edges everywhere, no matter what mode you play. Rapidly getting into jaw-droppingly huge wars spanning multiple worlds is brilliant - it really is. And there’s no other RTS that gives players so much destructive power. But the lack of tactical depth and focus on constantly rushing makes Planetary Annihilation tiring. Overall 6/10.","October 11, 2014","true","28.8"," 122 of 211 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","122","211","0","0"

So if you want to have fun with you starting on a planet, and the AI on another, you'll have to b luck for it to get randomly assigned to another planet.**EDIT: As of today, September 10th, you can set the AI to spawn offworld, at the same planet as a player, or randomly, IN MULTIPLAYER CUSTOM MATCHES. Not in Skirmish yet. No idea why... ¬¬\n\n- METAL PLANETS STILL HAVE METAL SPOTS, (so you cannot harvest where you want, you have to use the spost as a regular planet) BUT THAT IS NOT ALL!!! - a lot of times the metal spots spawn where the catalyst (the structure that "activates" metal planets to fire)  should be! (so you cannot build the catalyst because there is a metal spot on the way!!!!!\n\n- The AI is orbitally dumb. Get out of your starting planet. You win. Congratulations. ** EDIT: testing if the new changes improved it...\n\n- The planets have a "realistic" impact setting: if you send an asteroid to annihilate another planet, if, by any chances, YOUR PLANET is on the way ( and you CANNOT PREVIEW THAT) the asteroid will hit YOUR planet, instead of the enemy's, as you designated.\n\nSo, until this is fixed, DO NOT BUY IT!\n\nAt its current state, I would qualify it as Beta, and not as a complete game, with an """expansion""".

A very unique RTS with a variety of stategies you can use to fight your opponent. You and a couple of friends can sit down and literally burn the hours away playing this, ive had some very good times playing this game.\n\nThe reason im giving this game a negative reviews is because Uber Entertainment cannont contain themselves. Developement for this game is very slow, they half ♥♥♥ released it as a full game to make money quicker, they decided "hey, we have a ton of unfinished content that we promised to release for PA, lets make an entirely new game, that'll make our customers love us!", and now they basically re-released the game with like 5 new "Titan" units for $30. I respect the fact that for previous PA owners they made the "standalone DLC" $13 but I feel like Uber was very ambitious with PA, it had a great future and could have been a very popular RTS but they have clearly shown that they only care about one thing, making as much money as quick as they can.\n\nI really love this game but playing it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth, it could have been so much more, granted that i havent played this game in ages i do occasionally check news for it and start it up every once in a while to see if much has changed. The feeling i get from Uber Entertainment is that they made a ton of money off of kickstarter with PA and then half released it on steam to make even more money and since by then they were up to their necks in $100 bills they just dont care anymore.

It's utter garbage and if PA ever really wants to get people who dont want multiplayer to join they have to change this or die. The "difficulty" often depends on how lucky you are to get the current "meta" teck path so you can beat an AI which has all teck at it's disposal.\n\nThere idea of new gameplay is atrosiouse.

The game crashes about 5 seconds after it launches. This game is highly unstable right now and personally, I would just buy supreme commander 2.

So I'm just giving my own 2 cents.  Sadly the good doesn't make up for the bad. I paid $75 for early access and the game was pretty good for early access, it had it's bugs but for the most part it was fun. I'm Dissapointed however that they didn't change much from then and kept the game really simple. I guess thats what happen when you pay someone for a job they have yet to do. Well not always but it happened with these guys. I wish that the game didn't end up this way, it had a lot going for it. However, they dev's didn't care, they already have their money. This game may be worth it at a few dollars, like $5 but at $30 nope not at all. Even less so for those who paid extra to get into early access. And now the game is for the most part, dead. Unless you buy the Titans DLC. What is the deal with that not just being an update? It would have been this games one redeeming quality.

The endless ways in which you could dominate your foes was pure bliss. Whether it was airdropping massive waves of units behind your enemies, sending naval fleets to bombard ground units, or straight up plowing the enemy commander over with hundreds of ground units! This game though has failed my expectations in every way. There's barely any units, the miniture planet instead of a flat map is confusing as hell and it's basically just a rush style game (like Star Craft 2 online ladder matches). What a rip off, don't buy this game. They've tarnished the series' reputation.

I was addicted when it first came out and for several years beyond.  This game attempts to capture that, sadly it only attempts.  I bought this in pre alpha for sixty bucks and I really regret that decision.\n\nFirst, the good part.  The build system is just like total annihilation, which I always thought was a great way of doing it. ( you build a starter factory which produces a builder which can in turn build the advanced version of it's factory which produces more advanced vehicles of that type).  Now I am not a fan of pvp with this type of game because it always ends up being the same thing, build a small economy as fast as you can, then build a big enough force of low cost units and hope that it overwhelms the force that the other player has managed to build.  It's usually not a lot of fun in my book, but if that is what you like then this game will deliver in that department.\n\nNow the bad.  Many things in this game are what I would consider incomplete.  First and foremost there is not a storyline/campaign that has been well thought out so that it is interesting and fun.  It is simply this galactic war garbage which is merely a series of ai skirmishes with no storyline or real progression.  In fact it severely limits you on the tech tree as you can only use a small percentage of the tech tree at any one time.  I understand that they were trying to be different from the normal path of giving you one piece at a time and building it up.  But being different just for the sake of being different does not neccessarily translate into being good.  In my opinion it is actually really bad!  If you click on the screen shot above where it shows the picture of the galaxy then you will get to see the entire single player "campaign".  Thats literally all it is, you just move between those stars and play a skirmish, I would assume there is some little congrats screen at the end or a ten second animation where one commander blows up another one, but I just get so bored I can't even get that far.  And honestly who cares about the one sentence that lets you know they have nothing else to deliver in that area.  I'm sure they used some kind of computer voice over for it as well, as if that somehow will make me forget that I just spent the last few hours being bored out of my mind with no reward.  There are also some things I found which seem broken, like not being able to build advanced metal extractors on certain metal deposits due to terrain conflicts.\n\nSo in the end my main point would be that if you love a mindless blow em up where you and your teenage friends get high and pwn each other then this is probably right up your alley.  But if you are looking for an immersive and rich experience then you should look somewhere else.","September 7, 2014","false","18.7"," 127 of 228 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","127","228","3","1"

I agree with everyone else about it being out of beta, it shouldn't be. But the game is here and whether it is finished or not it is really good. Maybe the gameplay isn't polished, basically all you have to do is rush at the start of the game if you are both on the same planet or who can build the nukes the fastest game, but when you are with friends, you can set up rules like grace periods, no nukes, no annihilasers stuff like that, so you can have a proper war with units and armys. Now on the the singleplayer side of things (Galactic War). This is possibly the worst singleplayer i have ever played, like, i can't even understand what i have to do, limited troops and armys, it needs to be worked on. However, this is a very promising game and could be the best game i have played. Graphics aren't the best and i did expect better since this is a PLANETARY based game, but it is enough to tide me over for now, i just hope they improve.\n\nThey are still working on the game but it is very slow, made even slower by the 'new' and 'improved' game Human Resources. They have added a lot of things including unit cannons and offline mode, so in my opinion, ITS NOT A SCAM. I recommend this game to whoever hasn't played an rts before, because they have added in a small player guide which will help you a bit.\n\nAlso, this game in its current stage is not worth £22.99 or $35, buy it when its on sale for 50% off or something, then its worth what it should be.","December 23, 2014","true","80.2"," 40 of 68 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","40","68","0","0"

My goodness, if you don't have the patience this game might be a bit difficult for you to play.\n\nThe game follows the Supreme Commander scheme where there is a main robot that builds most of the factories. There is of course minions that help you do the same, but depending what level they are (L1, L2, L3 as units and buildings alike follow this pattern) means how fast they can build or what they can build. A level 1 tank depot of course is not the same as a level 2, but a level 2 depot will require a level 2 ground unit builder. The game is fun, and jumping from planet to planet is pretty cool. Transport ships are available but portals make the journey a lot easier. There are ground units, air units, and sea units that are available to build. You are also able to launch units into orbit and are able to have defensive units on the ground (like turrets) as well as in orbit.\n\nVisually the game delivers the proper graphics and have yet to notice any major chops within the scene.\n\nThis game is okay... I'd like to say it's great but it's a very slow build up on action.

I have been apart of the community of RTS ever since the first Warcraft and Starcraft. Cried when Command and Conquer was destroyed by EA. i.e. (Red Alert 3) and played SupCom like crazy. I like this game and would recommend it when it goes on sale. I think it was 7$ a couple weeks back. Otherwise wait for a sale. Not worth otherwise atm. This game has amazing potential and I want to believe in it. Which I do, it is just that from playing it so much I have found plenty of things that hurt it in its path to greatness.\n\nI will say now this was my experience with single player vs. AI and GW. I do not care about multiplayer. I am sure it has its fair share of problems too. I have played the multiplayer. Just not enough to make informed opinions on it.\n\nGRAPHICS AND OPTIMIZATION\n\nI have a high end gaming rig; core i7 quad core OC 4.66ghz, GTX770, 12gb RAM. This game has cell shaded graphics which I think is cool and artsy. It doesn't have to look amazing to be fun and it does look good where the polish has been applied like the death star laser, it looks awesome! Also nukes look better than they used to. IT IS POORLY OPTIMIZED. I get 60fps when I just start up a game but 20min later or even maybe 10min later depending on what level of difficulty I am playing on it dips down to 30FPS or lower for the rest of the game! I have a FPS counter in the corner of the screen while I play and I noticed whenever an explosion goes off it dips to exactly 30fps. I dono if that's just my comp or what but that's weird. I feel like this is still beta, there is no way this is final build or even close to feeling complete. The Planets are a bit bare and boring but that was so we as players could focus on fighting with as many robots as possible without it lagging to the point of unplayable. I am fine with that. Bigger battles and less lag, cool! Sign me up! In reality what we get is lag, crashing and screen tearing. Sometimes I will still get textures that wont load for an entire planet at the start of a game so I have to start over till it works. That doesn't happen too often but IT DOES HAPPEN. Things have gotten better with graphics and optimization over time since release though. It used to be a lot worse. I mean read some of the other reviews from a couple months back and you will get a good picture. Back in early Beta I would get fps drops that were ridiculous. Yes I did pay 70$ for this game. Because I believed in it, I believed it could turn out to be one of the greatest RTS's of all time. Still has work that needs to be done to make it truly great.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nI have played as of now 63.8 hrs on record of this game. Starting from late ALPHA I got to see this game develop from a basic prototype to what it is today. The ALPHA and BETA phases of this game are wrongly named since the BETA felt like an ALPHA most the time. But let us talk about the game as of now, not how it was. I said it before that this game feels like it is in BETA still. Balance is an issue in this game and will be forever I am afraid. If there is ONE metal planet in the game then it turns into "who can race to the metal planet first". The metal planet is VASTLY OP. 1st of all it takes no time to recharge what so ever. ZAP. then ZAP. another ZAP. WIN. 2nd The amount of power it takes to fire it is incredibly little. It is a superweapon yes but there should be strict regulations for making it a bit more balanced. Multi planet battles are a problem too, if you or an AI gets fully entrenched on a planet it becomes a game of nuke the ever loving crap out of the other planet till you win. You cannot go and land on an enemy planet with the space transport which STILL only has capacity for ONE unit because of the insane response time of the AI that swoop in and kill your landers so fast. Plus the orbital defense and fighters make it nearly impossible to send anything other than swarms and swarms of fighters, landers and orbital bombardment units. I am sorry if my brain cannot handle swapping between 5 planets and managing thousands of units all at once. It is not easy to manage everything after 50min of play time with multi planet battles. The planet smashing is still broken and looks so bad. It is definitely better then what it used to be but compared to the LASER DEATH CANNON its not polished at all. Flying through space the engines still disconnect from the model at times, the entire animation is clunky from start to finish, the explosion from the planet crashing can be laggy or just miss timed. There is just something so wrong with it and yet it is a key selling point to this game. FIX IT. THE LASER CANNON LOOKS SO GOOD. They have it in them to make this superweapon better, look at the nukes and unit cannon. OH YA, UNIT CANNON. Recently the developers added a Unit Cannon which can build and launch units anywhere onto a planet, even across space onto another planet. This is cool and I love it. I remember seeing it with the original trailer and wondered where it went. Its well polished and can only build certain units so its not mega OP. Overall the lower end of the spectrum is pretty well polished and balanced it seems. Just when players reach endgame it seems to drag on forever and certain superweapons are really overpowered. The game shines with 1-2 planets and can be so much fun to play without the planet smashing and lasers. There is one thing I will mention that I love to do, invasion fleets. Building over 300 of those orbital lasers and sending them to a totally entrenched enemy planet and watch the destruction, takes forever to get there though.\n\nGalactic War. Hey designers. I know its tough to make a game. Especially one of this magnitude and ambition, but come on. Galactic War is a joke right now. GW right now consists of the player battling through an entire galaxy, system by system, to obtain cards that boost your armies power so you can conquer your enemies and take over the galaxy. Backtracking through already conquered systems you have to click on each system individually, just to get to where you want to go. There should be an automatic "go to" button so I don't have to click on each system so many times. Players should be able to go anywhere they want within their territory. Once u get to where you want you can not go back, so you had better decide which system you want to attack before you move. The upgrade cards you get from beaten systems are borderline useless or plainly helpful. It is random too what you get from each system and you only know until after what you are getting. This is just bad planning and design. Players should know what they are getting before hand so we can plan a better route and stay away from the more useless cards. The home systems of enemies are 1v3-5 and you had better hope you got an assisting commander or two or else you will get stomped on.\n\nUSER INTERFACE AND MENUS\n\nThis game has bad menus. I can not think of a single reason why the menus in your game should be this bad. There is a 1 second lag time between me mousing over a menu icon and it lighting up to show that I have highlighted it. Sometimes I have had to click more than once on the main menu just for it to receive my input. What is this. Please, please fix your menus. The menu's haven't changed since late BETA. It is so frustrating having to click 2 or more times on everything. This isn't even in game. In game the UI seems pretty basic. They should take a note from Sins of a Solar Empire on UI. In PA it gets hard to organize and keep track of everything especially after 30min. You have to play alot to get used to it. Not so "new user friendly". Not even an idle worker button! Age of Empires 1 had that!\n\nWRAP UP - I have seemed to run out of room with my rant. I wanted to say more. But I will say that I love this game and want it to be better. PA has potential to be better then SupCom. For now SupCom will remain the better game.","January 12, 2015","true","141.8"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","3"

For once we had a game that was not a clone of the one of the "standard" rts. (like Star Craft) The 3d worlds and unique art style, as well as the addition of the orbital layer seemed to have much promise. It was also a game by a smaller developer, and many of us like to support smaller companies. When I bought the game, it was not finished by any strech of the imagination. It was buggy, laggy, and had balance issues. But even then, it was fun. A while later, the game was better optimised, balanced, and had more unit variety ( around the time of the Unit Cannon update). That was when I really began to though that uber would pull the game together and make it into the game that the majority of players had hoped for when they bought it.\n\nNow that Titans has been released, I and many other players (judging by the reviews and steam forums) feel cheated. The fact that Uber has released our dream update as a seperate game is like a slap to the face. The game is not even near complete without the update. Its rediculous that Uber expects even the backers from the beta and gamma phases of the game to pay an extra $40 for an update to an unfinished game.\n\nI don't know about other players,  but Uber can say good by to any funds from my wallet until this is changed. I am sad that I had to give this game a bad review, as the concept was excellent; but I can't reccomend a game where needed updates cost as much as the game itself.","August 25, 2015","false","59.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

I've not spent much time playing it since it came on Steam because I only occasionally start it up to see whether any of my complaints have been addressed, which to date they have not.\n\nRegarding the many glowing reviews this game has recieved and the number of people who have disliked my review, you should ask yourself whose opinion is more important to your decision whether or not to invest in this game's continued development:\n\nA) What people who've paid money for the game hope it might eventually turn into\nB) The reality of how the game currently plays and a rational projection of how its development will continue based on how development has progressed to this point\n\nIn my opinion, "B" is more valuable.  So this is my review of how the project currently stands and my projection for its future based on how development has progressed over the last few years. Also, while my review is strongly negative, I'm absolutely NOT hoping to see this game fail, I paid a lot of money for it and I desperately want RTS games to have a comeback.\n\nI'd truly love to be able to say that Planetary Annihilation is another example of how crowdfunding can save genres that mainstream publishers have abandoned, similar to how Star Citizen and Elite: Dangerous have demonstrated that there is still demand for space combat simulators.  However, I can't in good conscience just blindly recommend this game to people in hopes that the additional money in the developer's bank account will allow them time to fix the game's multitude of problems.  They've already greatly extended their development timetable and have almost nothing to show for it - in fact, late last year they finally just abandoned all notion of having a development plan and said that the game will be released "when it's done"... well, there are companies that I'd accept this from - Valve, Stardock, etc - but the problem is, they're not one of those companies.  Their staff isn't hand-picked from industry-leading companies, there's no brilliant developer like Chris Taylor or Sid Meier at the helm.  Here's their proof that they can be trusted with your money: promises and delays.\n\n-----\n\nOriginal review:\n\nOne of Planetary Annihilation's biggest problems at its core - battle across multiple randomly-generated planets - isn't conducive to good RTS gameplay.  The entire basis of the real-time strategy genre is the strategic use of terrain, and although this is probably the least fixable problem it's far from being the only one.  If you don't see why having randomly-generated battlefields is a terrible idea, let me explain:\n\nThink about your favorite RTS game; maybe it's Total Annihilation, Starcraft, Forged Alliance, one of the Command & Conquer games, or even something totally different like Homeworld.  All of these are great games in their own way but no matter how much you loved your favorite, I know that if you think about it you'll remember that not only were there maps you wanted to play on all the time, there were also maps you despised.  If you played a lot of multiplayer, your friends and people online probably had their own favorite maps too, and you might even have gotten in arguments because one of you was sick of playing certain maps so often.  Maybe your favorite map relied heavily on the use of a strategy you were really good at, or you enjoyed one that started each player on equal footing, or you liked a map because each starting location was unique in some way.\n\nNow, take all that away.  Instead of your favorite game coming with a carefully polished, gameplay-tested, diverse set of maps designed specifically to highlight and take advantage of the game's units, structures, and unique overall design, imagine all the maps are replaced with ones which are randomly generated and with no real terrain to speak of, not even something as elementary as differences in elevation.  Sure, there might be a few mountains, some canyons, a lake or two, and so on, but they serve almost exclusively as window dressing because they weren't placed by a professional human game developer in such a way as to foster strategic gameplay.  By coincidence they might occasionally form a small choke point or provide some other (purely theoretical) strategic value, but because they are so small and easily bypassed they still don't serve any purpose in terms of gameplay.\n\nWhat do I mean, "easily bypassed"?  Well, all the terrain features are tiny compared to the scope of even a small planet... and there's the problem summed up in a single word: "planet".  Maps have no edges or corners, so you can attack (or be attacked) from any direction.  And by "any direction", I do truly mean "any" direction, including orbital bombardment, or even by way of an unstoppable planetary collision for which you have little warning.  This means that defenses are functionally useless most of the time because it's almost always quicker, cheaper, and easier to simply replace lost structures after the enemy has moved on than it is to attempt to defend your territory from every possible type and direction of attack.\n\nThe same is true when attacking.  No matter how much damage you inflict, it often feels almost impossible to cause lasting harm to your opponents.  The game continues on and on like this, a planetary-scale game of "musical chairs", until one player's attention span is exhausted and they forget to move their commander out of harm's way, leading to it being destroyed and them losing the game.  Games end more often by accident than as a result of a clever plan or a strategic blunder.\n\nIf you've read this far then you might be thinking (or hoping) that I'm out of things to complain about, but unfortunately you'd be wrong.  In fact, I've only scratched the surface of the things wrong with Planetary Annihilation's irreparably flawed core design, things so central to its basic concept that they can never truly be "fixed" because it would mean starting from scratch.  I haven't even begun on topics like the unit and structure balance, the interface, the graphics, the audio, etc.  That's because all of these things - even the random map design - are insignificant in comparison to the one singular thing that I believe will forever doom this game to serving as an example of the dangers of Kickstarter hype: after so long in development, there remains such a multitude of braindead-obvious flaws both in the game's design and presentation that I, as an early and enthusiastic backer of this project and a huge fan of RTS games in general, must conclude that the developers are genuinely trying their best to make a great RTS game but have absolutely no concept of how to do so.\n\nAs I write this, the game is over 7 months late for its final release deadline, a date which had already been pushed back.  Its developers have now simply given it a release date of "when it's done".  I paid a lot of money in good faith to support this game's development so I truly, genuinely want to believe that even if it doesn't become the groundbreaking RTS we were promised, it might at least turn into a worthwhile product one day, but nothing I see right now points toward that being a likely possibility.  Just to put things in perspective, it was only few months ago that they first added water units to the game.\n\nPA will probably never be truly finished, let alone become an RTS in the same league as the 17 year old masterpiece that inspired it, Total Annihilation - or that game's true spiritual successor, Supreme Commander, which despite its own set of flaws still had a competent design at its core and was clearly developed with gameplay in mind from the first planning stages rather than as an afterthought.\n\nDo not buy this game.","July 11, 2014","false","5.5"," 71 of 128 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","71","128","0","9"

But fortunatly i came in 4 months after it was released. After 3 hours in i can say that this is probably the most exciting RTS i've played in years.\n\nWhen i play a RTS i'm used to hiding in a hole and waiting for the computers to fight amongst themselves, but this game is diffrent. You try that in Planetary Annihilation you will lose, and you will lose quick. The only way to win PA is to be as aggressive and smart as you can. And that's something i really really like about this game.\n\nI'm absolutly in love with the planetary view it planning how to get to your enemys more interesting. Wanna get to your enemies but he is building a wall? Walk around it!  Another thing i really love about the game is the fact that you can jump to diffrent planets and hell even destroy the planets! It's just such a crazy and cool mechanic that i freaking love.\n\nThe campaign for the game is also amazing because its a randomly generated board where you just have to destroy every enemy in the galaxy. I love it.\n\nThere are downsides though. There are absolutly 0 tutorials in game. Wanna learn how to really play? Gotta hit up the wiki, and i really hate games that make me do that and it's really really unnessary. I dont' wanna read thousands of lines of stuff just to learn what each thing does i wanna play the game. Another thing i've been reading about is the Customer serverice is horridous and the developers of the game seem to be really hateful to the community lately. It also has always online which sucks but i'm always connected to the internet so i've never had that problem.\n\nOverall i'm giving this game a 8/10 and would recommend it if it goes on sale. It's very exciting and makes you think and makes you wanna play agressivly.","January 23, 2015","true","9.6"," 29 of 49 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","29","49","0","2"

The game is underrated, however this is understandable, as the game is so different to most strategy games that some new features understandably feel a little shallow.\n\nThe gameplay of the game is perhaps the greatest strength and downfall of this game. Its mechanics are all very simple, yet it has a steep learning curve (especially in the multiplayer). As in most games you build factories to create offensive units, and some sort of resource gathering contraption to gain power. These basic concepts aren’t elaborated upon, but are spiced up by the scale of the areas given, made possible by space travel (done through simple mechanics, almost identical to how one would get from place to place normally).\n\nOne thing that isn’t done well is the dynamic “currencies” with which one makes vehicles and powers buildings. These functions don’t act as money, that can by spent, rather than efficiency, something which makes gameplay (i.e. base or vehicle building), slower or faster. This does NOT work. The base building feels stagnated, constantly slowing down or speeding up, due to seemingly random circumstances on the battlefield. Simply put, it’s boring to wait, especially if one doesn’t know why he or she is waiting. However this is all completely justified by the incredible scale of the battles one can compete in. At times there will by thousands of units onscreen once, and it is a satisfying affair to send the entire capacity of ones military force, to crush the opponents base.\n\nSingle player is a series of simple missions paired with some worryingly bad AI. Sometimes teammates will build water armies in a spot of water, on an otherwise dry planet, but at least it’s comical to watch the poor AI trying to figure out what is going on. Multiplayer is where most will spend their hours. It has an incredibly simple ranking system that works fairly well. Matchmaking queues are quick, and opponents are about as good as you.\n\nThe game has an unmistakable theme with simple square graphics; wish a nice and simple color scheme. However, frame rate varies. I understand rendering a whole galaxy easy, but am disappointing to see such simple graphics slow the game down to only 40 FPS. Other than that there isn’t much to be said about this games average presentation. The solar systems look like wide out dots, and battles have alrtight visual effects (nothing to boast about).\n\nThe one think the game just completely fails at, is at bringing a good soundtrack. The theme is a booming imperial track with little to do with the themes. It awkwardly blurs with the audio and sounds unnecessarily epic. The game could have been much better sounding with a simple techno soundtrack with less extravagant flare. The audio isn't clean and crisp, and the voice acting is nothing to special.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nThis game had lots of potential if it had only focused more on its core mechanics. Its far to ambitious, however is still a satisfying experience that has enough content to keep you occupied. The development team behind this game aren't very compitent with delivering constant updates, and generally polishing the game. Uber Entertainment are very ambitious, but have limited resources, which means they often find refuge at kickstarter. This means they don't have regular funding for thier projects, hence struggling to update or fix the game.\n\nSCORE\n\n70/100\n\nAn overambitious mess, with moments of genuine awe during the massive battles that keep me coming back for more.","July 11, 2015","true","26.0"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","7"

It's tutorial explains very few details of the game and you have to spend many hours playing it alone to find out, learn and use every perspective of the game. If i was asked to give a rating for its tutorial i would be lenient if i was giving 0/10! Uber Entertainment needs to remake the whole tutorial section of the game from the beginning.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nOnce i played this game with a friend, a friend who was the person who donated the game to me and i thank him so much for that (Thank you Adam :D !!!!!),  and saw the video tutorials he made, i managed to fully understand it!\n\nThe combination of base building, creating huge robotic armies, fighting, travelling to other planets, advancing technologically is so greatly and carefully designed that i cannot find anything negative to mention!\n\nLet's analyze it a bit more.\n\nYou begin with your faction's Commander, the strongest and most important unit of all, on an uninhabited planet where you need to fight and destroy your opponent's Commander to win the game. The Commander is the strongest unit of your army, "he" is a huge robot and can both fight and build. Starting the game your Commander needs to build asap a strong infrastructure (energy and metal) and fortification (defensive weapons and towers) system around your base while he constructs as many as possible unit creation buildings.\n\nWhile your Commander is fortifying your base, you are in need of defensive and scout units in order to face and detect the quickly developed enemy base. That's the point when skirmish battles between you and your opponent will start in order to check each other's base limits, power and determination! In the meanwhile, you both secretly try to develop a massive and strong robotic army to encounter your opponent's efforts.\n\nIn the mid game fun starts :D\nYou are 15-20 minutes in game and you have now access to all available technologies and buildings. That's the point when you need to consider your migration to another planet of your Solar System and your need of a satellite around your main planet so that you have a full idea of your opponents moves! And indeed, you need to hurry as you don't want your opponent to capture a planet before you do or to gain an advantage in your race towards the nuclear domination! At this point you need to pay attention for any incoming nuclear missiles from your opponent's side as they do a massive damage and only 1 successful hit is able to delay you and result to your fast defeat.\n\nIntensity is really big and the multiplayer games will keep you going for many hours!\n\n\nIt is indeed an expensive game but if you are a fan of the kind, it will become your daily entertainment ;)\n\nWorth buying it!\n\n\n\nTotal Rating: 9/10 because of its extremely poor tutorial","October 14, 2014","true","8.8"," 40 of 71 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","40","71","0","1"

At any price. ITS REDEEMING FEATURE, ITS SCALE, IS HANDLED BY SLOWING DOWN TO BE UNUSABLE - BY DESIGN. THINK ABOUT THAT BEFORE YOU BUY - THE DEVS ARE SO BAD THEY COULDN'T MAKE THIS WORK ANY OTHER WAY.\n\nUber is extremely dishonest and has opted to release a totally half-baked product, on a massive cost (it started at $99!) with DLC and a new title entirely before even properly finishing the first one.\n\nPlanetary Annihilation's huge draw is supposed to be its scale. Multiple planets, thousands of units. Instead, load times are obscene, and the absolute kicker: it doesn't take long at all until the game throttles so badly that it's unplayable BY DESIGN.\n\nI'm in a game with 5 AI factions and one human player, and it's running 14s per 1s in game. The game's solution to its own untenable scale is to throttle down until its scale works - which means it fails horribly for the player and is extremely uninteresting.\n\nThis game could be fantastic, but that alone makes it almost complete, unusuable garbage. IF YOUR GAME CANNOT HANDLE A FEATURE WITHOUT THE ONLY SOLUTION BEING "THROTTLE DOWN TO 3 FRAMES PER MINUTE, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY NOT CONSIDER IT A FEATURE WORTH ADVERTISING".\n\nI got it on sale, @$26, and it was still more than this game is worth. It is my sincere hope Uber goes out of business completely and a competent developer decides to try and make the game PA should have been.\n\nGarbage. Complete and utter throttled garbage.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS.

Yay!\nUPDATE 12/18/14\nUnit cannon HOLY ♥♥♥♥!!!\nLiterally made the game 10x better, no more stalemates.\n\nHonestly though, most bugs are squashed and mechanics feel super solid now.\n\nThis is a definite steal, at $10 you might as well buy 3 for other people. This update has made things so much better, and I can't quite explain how much better this huge update made it.\n\n69/68 Would Cannon Unit Again.\nUPDATE 11/15\n\nI've gotten more out of the $40 I payed back in March. This game is the number one played game for me, and I'm not surprised even with L4D2 coming in at second place. Let me tell you why:\n\nPROS:\n\nInstead of listing stuff, which makes it look like the game only has highlighted parts, I am going to explain why I like it so much. The huge landscapes and massive armies without unit caps is the feaure that no other game can brag about. The moment the server starts to lag ever so slightly is the moment you realize that you did something right. Obviously, lag is bad, and it only occurs on huge systems or when you spam units.\n\nThe modding community is one of the best I've been a part of, the organization and variety turn this game into a sandbox for game modes, inlcuding entire balance mods and game modes like "Dox4Lyf" where there are giant dox and dox cannons. This is the main reason why I come back to play it.\n\nCompetitive play is also very healthy; with an active esports community and system editor, the competitve side is amazingsauce.\n\nCONS, AND WHY I DONT LIKE SOME OF IT\n\nYeah. There's no tutorial. But guess what? There's a thing called youtube. This is not an excuse for there veing no official guide, but really? You want an official tutorial in 2014? Sigh...\n\nAnyway, the game has lots of bugs, including some crashing, but there is a handy recconnect feature that will recconnect you to your latest game if you leave or crash. There are very few graphic bugs, and when something does happen with the UI, just press F5 and it should be fixed.\n\nThe balance is kinda bad, but with a modding community, there is really nothing to worry about. Vanilla balance is still fun, it really is, but there are some obvious problems that need to be addressed.\n\nCONCLUDE\n\nPA is worth more than $30, and it's a shame people look at the cleche reviews here on steam and the rating on metacritic and automatically say "nope". The game has a future and it would be awesome to have more people be a part of it.

It takes some serious hardware to make it run, but the visual appeal is very high.  The main failings are in gameplay, particularly single player.\n\nIn my opinion, they've made a big mistake in confusing length for depth, and after a while it becomes clear that the only real solutions to the game are to rush or grind.  Games seem to last either about eight minutes or three hours, with little in between.  You either assassinate your opponent's commander right away, or you're in for a very long, slow slog through hundreds of inert power plants and metal extractors, and assaults on base after base after base.  When multiple planets are involved, it slows down even further.  I add that with some serious disappointment, by the way, as multiple planets seemed like such a great idea, but in reality I have found it just a bridge too far in keeping track of an RTS like this unit by unit.  You can't really automate any of the things you'd like to be able to in order to make things like multiple planets or spherical maps work in any really convincing way, and very often you'll find yourself getting a "Base Under Attack" warning and spend more time wondering where it's happening than responding to it.  You can't set your units to do anything useful while you're not watching, like run away when they're attacked, or respond to enemies attacking your base.  You can set up a perpetual unit patrol, but that's about it.  And your little tanks will sit distressingly still while being bombarded from outside their sight range when you'd think they should be able to be set to retreat when they're hit, or when they've reached some kind of damage tolerance.  Maybe there are ways to do this, but they aren't terribly easy to see.  More often than not, they'll just kind of stand around waiting to die until you specifically tell them to do otherwise.\n\nGalactic War was particularly interesting in conception, and another feature I thought highly of initially, but the way it's structured is bizarre, and frequently puts you up against enemies that cannot be beaten, not because the AI is particularly smart, but simply because you play with handicaps based on having to randomly discover the correct technology to allow you to do even simple things like store energy or metal.  You can't recon planets ahead of time, you have to commit to an attack whole-hog, and if you haven't happened to chance upon some particular technology to counter something your opponent has that you don't, games become very hard to play.  Since you can't withdraw from an unwinnable battle, it means that one bad skirmish basically spoils your whole campaign.  This was an oddly obvious thing for a game that's so clearly structured in a system of strength and counter-strength, and I have to wonder why they have kept it working this way.  More often than not, your very first enemy has advanced, multifaceted tech options and you're simply throwing masses of first-tier tanks at him because that's all you have available.  I don't find that to be an element of depth or a challenge - I just find it frustrating at best, and boring at worst.  Moreover, the "come-from-behind" victories those conditions are apparently supposed to encourage don't feel rewarding, they  just feel like you spent an hour mobbing your opponent with masses of disposable units instead of planning and executing any kind of an interesting or multi-faceted attack.\n\nI hasten to add that I'm not huge on multiplayer experiences with RTS games, though, so take that with a grain of salt - playing against humans may be more of a rich experience, but if gameplay videos are anything to go by, it seems to be a lot of the same kind of build-up-and-rush tactics as more or less the only dimension of the game - few multiplayer games I've watched get anywhere near the final technology levels, making them essentially interestingly designed dead weight.  And to reiterate the point about the spherical planets: visually fascinating and well-conceived, but the feature doesn't add any real tactical detail or depth - it just makes it hard to keep track of what you're looking at and how your camera is oriented.  It also very often results in what's "up" being totally relative, and so makes the maps hard to track, especially, again, when you have more than one planet to worry about.\n\nI plan to come back to this from time to time, but overall, I find it to be a drag more than anything else.  It's not so much excting to play as it is long and frequently irritating.  Somehow, on the way from Supreme Commander to here, they lost the real character of the game.  If you're looking for Supreme Commander 3, this is not it.  Stick with Forged Alliance and you'll be much happier with the experience.","August 9, 2015","false","30.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","2"

I don't care about how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the devs are. It doesn't make the game any less fun when I play it.\n\nAs a person who was unfamiliar with the RTS genre, this was a perfect game to get started on. I picked it up for free from BundleStars, and this is by far the best game I've recieved in a giveaway.\nAt first the game seemed confusing for me. There was no proper tutorial and the fact that I'm new to RTSes just makes this more so, but in my first game I already picked up the controls real fast - it was all very intinuitive. It also is really tactical, which I'm sure skill will make a big difference when playing against harder AIs or people. As far I can see, there isn't that much of a "meta" which means you can freely develop your own playstyle while still being effective. The game also runs fairly smooth (at least on PC). I've not experienced as much as an FPS drop yet. Finally, the amount of flaws is minimal for an early access game. The only bad thing I've encountered so far is the fact that there's no tutorial - as I mentioned above. Game progress can also be slow (games take around half an hour or more), which I'm sure some people DO mind, despite being able to save the game.\n\nI encourage people to pick up this game, it definitely isn't overpriced and to play it if you happen to recieve it for free like me.","March 15","true","7.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Early game isn't repetitive and boring (unlike Starcraft 2) since units get out VERY quickly.\nVery mod friendly (especially for UI and hotkeys)\nCan create your own maps\nUnit diversity is certainly sufficient (I've played MANY Starcraft 2 matches with less unit diversity than this game)\nMultiplayer community is still active (this is primarily a reaction to people shouting "ded gaem!1" with no basis [basically because it's not nearly as big as more mainstream competitive games])\nAwesome Picture-in-Picture feature that allows you to multitask two speparate locations (planets, even) at once.\nOne faction means everyone's using the same tools to get the job done. Places emphasis more on player skill.\nMatches can last anywhere from 8 minutes to over an hour.\nAwesome art style and soundtrack\nCons:\nSingle player campaign is lacking. It's definitely still fun! But it doesn't have a lot of meat. No continuous story.\nUnits still need to be balanced more. (This is always the case with a recently released rts, and the game isn't HORRIBLY balanced) Naval is very underwhelming at the moment. Basic bot unit (dox) needs tweaking to become less prominent in the early game. Tier 2 units (which are pretty sweet) need to be worked to a point where their use is more encouraged. As of now, they aren't used that much. The community has made several balance mods already, however.\nOne faction can be disappointing to those who were looking for drastically different playstyle shifts.\n\n\nThat's about it, folks. The game contains much more good than it does bad. Many reviews on here seem very emotional or overly sensationalized so hopefully this was concrete and objective enough to aid you in a responsible purchasing decision.","December 2, 2014","true","24.9"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","21","36","0","2"

Very many levels of strategy where terrain affects strategy dramatically. There is no one powerful strategy that everyone uses, spicing up gameplay and requiring a smart person who can adapt to different challenges and scenarios. I have spent over 270 hours playing this game and I plan to keep that number counting as more updates are released. It is not a game, like other RTS' that you can take your time and stare at your guys. You need to be quick and manage your troops effectively. Once you start expanding to other planets and making more bases, managing gets harder. Giant pushes of units will not work anymore. You have to corrdinate attacks from many means, space, land, air, sea, etc. Attack from multiple fronts and use the planet to your advantage. It's a sphere, you can attack from anywhere. Take over your enemies' outposts, manage your resourses, annihilate your foes.\n\nATTENTION: MANY PEOPLE HAVE  QUIT THIS GAME DUE TO THEIR INCOMPETENCE IN PLAYING THE GAME EFFECTIVELY. THIS IS NOT AN EASY GAME\n\nNote: If you are looking for a singleplayer experience, do not purchase this game. The game is geared towards multiplayer gameplay. Singleplayer gameplay does not reflect the multiplayer game very well at all. Also, mutliplayer games can range from being very short or very long in length.

I stand corrected. This is a trainwreck of a project. Nothing is there. Game got it's "release", but its still in never-ending beta. I mean, it is "beta than nothing", but i'd rather prefer nothing than this mediocrity.\nBuilt it's fame on nostalgic vibe of Total Annihilation, this game fails to deliver, and instead constantly slaps you:\n"Oh so you wanted various units and balanced unit forks like in TA? Streamlined!" *slap*, "Oh so you wanted interesting maps with lots of variety we've been talking about? Budget cuts!" *slap* "Oh so you wanted epic single player campaign?

And we all know what piece of ♥♥♥♥ of a game that were. So much so that they, few months after release, threw it into free to play. And even there it failed to gain substantial crowd.\n\nSo please, for the love of god - do not buy it.

At the same time, the developer launched a kickstarter for a different game, which scared a lot of players (including myself) into thinking that that Planetary would be abandonded and unfinished. But each month we've been getting big patches that added in matchmaking, annihilasers, unit canons, balance tweaks, new air and sea units, etc. The devs are still working hard on planetary, and it plays like a complete game.\n\nThis is a great RTS that breaks the mold, and you'll never feel like you've played the same match twice.","February 8, 2015","true","96.6"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quitch/recommended/233250/","quitch","Quitch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quitch/","378 products in account","So what is Planetary Annihilation?Planetary Annihilation is part of the Total Annihilation/Supreme Commander RTS sub-genre. It focuses on large-scale battles, favouring macro over micro. Of the two it has more in common with Total Annihilation.\n\nTo summarise some of its selling points:\nPlanets - Play on spheres not flat planes. No corners to hide in, attacks can come from any direction.\nSystems - fight across multiple planets with different terrain types, and their orbits affect transit time.\nOrbital - A whole other layer in addition to land, air and water. Attack from space with lasers.\nSuper weapons - Forget experimentals, you fire units across space, smash planets into one another or even build your own Death Star to blow up other planets with.\nActive ladder - Unless you're in the top 10, your ladder queue time will be minimal. The ladder maps are both diverse and extremely well balanced. We've gone from top players having one or two generic opening builds to multiple builds per-map.\nActive developers - A day doesn't go by on the official forums without a post from the developers. Sorian even works on the AI on his days off.\nAI by Sorian - If you're into your single-player then you're getting an AI from the guy behind the infamous Sorian AI mod for SUPCOM, who was also recruited by GPG to "fix" the SUPCOM2 AI.\nScale - The game can be as small or epic as you want. You can battle over a tiny moon for ten minutes, or you can battle for hours over up-to 16 planets. Planets can vary massively in size, with the largest giving you more than enough space for a couple of hours fighting, if not more.\nMods - There's an active modding scene. The game was built to be moddable, and the PA Mod Manager gives you access to all of them. From graphical mods to UI mods to total conversion mods. Whether you want coloured explosions or to fight with nothing but Boom Bots with a massive Boom Bot birthing new Boom Bots where it walks, the modders have you covered.\nPowerful map editor - The System Editor allows you to create almost anything you can imagine. Planet shaped like an hourglass? Check. Planet with holes in its side you can hide in to escape bombers? Check. Planet with an outer ring which is also playable[forums.uberent.com]? Check. The community is letting its imagination run wild.\nActive scene - There are constantly streams[www.twitch.tv] and events happening. The game has Twitch support built into it, so someone is always streaming something, and there are events and tournaments[exodusesports.com] happening almost every weekend! Many of them feature cash prizes. And of course there's the community IRC[irc.lc] too if you just want to chat.\nProcedural campaign - If you're into single-player you have skirmish, but you also have the Galactic War which is a rogue-like campaign across a randomly generated galaxy. Fight across different systems (each of which plays like a standalone skirmish) against an increasingly difficult AI, unlocking new technologies to help you, and upon winning you unlock new loadouts for your future campaigns.\nServer-client mode - Remember how your multiplayer match in SUPCOM lagged when someone with a low spec machine hit their limit? There's none of that here. No matter how crappy your opponent's machine everything is run on the server so they can't impact your experience. The game scales far better in multiplayer. It also means people can't cheat.What PA doesn't have:\nA story campaign - Seriously, if you want a story campaign this is not the RTS for you.\nInteractive tutorial - There's an in-game user guide, but no walk through tutorial.\nDidn't this cost, like, $90 last week? Is this a scam?Planetary Annihilation was funded through a Kickstarter campaign in 2012. As with any Kickstarter campaign there were numerous tiers, with the higher tiers getting you access earlier, $90 for alpha and $60 for beta respectively. For $20 (or $15 if you backed early enough) you would receive the game on release.\n\nWhen Uber put PA on Steam under Early Access they didn't want backers to feel punished for buying in early. Indeed, without those backers the game wouldn't have been made (see Human Resources). Thus the Early Access followed the Kickstarter pricing, $90 for alpha and $60 for beta. Only when the game passed the expected release date of December 2013 did the price get reduced further and all Kickstarter backers were given access.\n\nSince then it has been priced, and put on sale, in line with any other game on Steam.\n\nDidn't the developers abandon the game?Uh, no. Developers are posting every day on the official forums[forums.uberent.com]. As I type this there's a developer in Twitch chat on the stream of ZaphodX[www.twitch.tv] talking about what changes are coming in the next Player Test Environment (PTE) release.\n\nI develop an AI mod for the game and all my questions are answered by Sorian, much as other developers have been on hand to respond to the queries of other modders. Meanwhile balance changes are released to the PTE, often to deal with issues raised by the community through the forums or identified by the developers in community tournaments and streams. Players test the changes out, revisions are made and eventually it makes its way from PTE to the live environment.\n\nYou can switch between PTE and live any time you want, either through the Uber launcher or Steam beta opt-in.\n\nDidn't it have a rough release?Yes, it did. There's no denying that the game wasn't in the shape we'd have like to have seen.\n\nBut it's not release any more, it's months later and the game has been hugely improved since then. I'm more than happy to say it's in an excellent state now. The last major release was just before Christmas and more changes are already on the way.\n\nReviewers who have revisited the game have been very positive[waywardstrategist.com].\n\nI heard it has micro-transactionsThe game allows you to buy commander models from an in-game store with real money. These are purely cosmetic changes with no gameplay impact. All the commanders are ones designed for $1000 Kickstarter backers who have not only approved their commanders being sold, but are also getting a cut from every sale.\n\nThe reason for this is to allow PA to be a long-term investment so Uber can continue to make further content releases well into the future. And you can ignore the entire thing if you want, it's not in your face, it's all tucked away in the armory.\n\nWhat about T3?The Orbital Factory is T3. But if you mean experimentals, then no, PA doesn't have experimentals. It has super weapons.\n\nI've heard I can't play offlineYou can.\n\nSo is it worth it?Yes, absolutely yes. The only other active game even vaguely in this space is Supreme Commander Forged Alliance Forever, and the two are different enough that I cannot see why you wouldn't want to try Planetary Annihilation.\n\nIt's a game that's actively supported, has developers who listen and respond to the community, and it's getting better every day.\n\nIt won't be for everyone, but no game ever is. It's not Total Annihilation and it's not Supreme Commander, it's both a spiritual successor to them while also being its own game.","March 7, 2014","true","685.9"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

At its core, way, way down, the games mechanics and overall idea and design are actually very good. Its fast paced, action packed, and keeps you on your toes; and its art-style is fresh and pleasant to look at. When it worked, I enjoyed it a lot.\nAhh, but theres the bad part: when it worked. The game is techinically out of its beta/dev stage, but it still feels like its in it.  Not only does the game lack any form of tutorial or guide in-game (you can find some on youtube), but the game also suffers from balancing issues:\n-Naval units are completely pointless. There is so little water on most planets in the first place, and they pack 0 punch.\n-It is WAY to tedious to try to do some of the things that the trailers brag about you being able to do in the game. The perfect example: slamming asteroids into enemy bases. Sure, its cool when you do it, but its not much of a reward to your hours of effort trying to do it.\nAnd then, of course, there are the bugs/glitches:\n-Graphical glitches have been the worst lately. Does anyone remember Total war: Rome 2's release? Thats the state the game has been hovering in ever since it's 'release'.\n-Enemy and troop a.i. will sometimes just die on you mid-combat.\n-Pathing is pretty bad: it was worse, but its been somewhat addressed in (the most) recent patches.\n-and many, many more...\nThe worst part about it is that Uber entertainment is seemingly preparing to abandon the game. Most of you have likely heard of the cancellation of 'Human recources' on kickstarter. Why are they attempting to create an entirely new game when PA isnt even finished, let alone polished? And there are plenty of us that remember SMNC. It is quite clear that the executives at uber entertainment are aiming more toward creating cash-ins than creating solid, fully complete games; likely the product of coorporate greed. Or maybe they arn't even aware that thet're doing what they are doing?\nIn conclusion, PA is a fun and fresh RTS with some fun gameplay elements, but its masked by a sea of bugs, a lack of gamemodes/additional content, and an overwhelming feeling of incompleteness. I give it a 5/10 when factoring in the bugs and other problems; a 7-8/10 when looking at FULLY WORKING gameplay. I only recommend this if you are willing to deal with all of said problems and really enjoy RTS's.","November 8, 2014","false","5.7"," 72 of 134 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","72","134","0","0"

A review that talks about the actual game itself and not the financial dealings of the company?\n\nTo be fair in this review, I'll do a pros/cons list so all the little children can migrate down below to the cons section...\n\nPros:\n- It's very smooth. I'm talking both gameplay and textures. I love the "blocky" feel to the game.\n- Lasers. C'mon guys, you can build a freakin death star in this game. How could you hate on the death star?\n- Halleys. Ok, you probably don't know what the halleys are if you don't play PA. Basically, they're giant thrusters you put on planets to make them fly into eaechother.\n- Little tiny worker robots. These things are adorable. Like actually. I use them cause the sound effect they make sounds like little children happily doing manual labor at your whim.\n- It feels finished. There's no open ended "coming soon" bs. It's a solid standalone game.\n\nHere's where the haters come in. "TITANS WAS A RIPOFF OMG KYS UBER".\n\nOk, well, yes it was kinda dumb for them to release Titans as another standalone game.\nHOWEVER! Did you children do your homework? No? Why am I not surprised.\nIf you had done your research or just happened to be around at the time Titans was released, Uber actually pulled PA from the steam store and put Titans in it's stead. Titans took over the original cost and that was that.\nBut all the little children couldn't put 2 and 2 together, so they all assumed they were being scammed.\nMaybe if the children stopped hating on Uber for a second, they'd see a possible strategy.\nConsider that it's possible that Uber wanted to release Titans into the game but put it as their face for the game itself?\nYes it backfired which is why it's back as more of a DLC than anything. But still, stop hating on the game...\n\nOk, and the cons:\n- I am on an iMac, on which it runs beautifully 99% of the time. It's crashed twice, mainly when then enemy AI spawns in too many units. I tried to replicate the crash using my own units, so I manufactured 5000+ units, during which my framerate dropped a little but it stayed up. I haven't heard of it crashing on PC.\n- It can get a bit repetitive if you don't have friends to play it with.\n- The imbecilic reviewers in the "Negative" section. Remove them and we can all forget about the minor issues above.\n\nSo yeah. 10/10, IGN something, idk.

The gameplay is fun; there are many super weapons like nukes, unit launchers, Orbital Lasers and more stuff. The interplanetary mechanics are pretty good too, it’s always fun to spread out your empire and dominate the enemy. The single player too, is pretty good and fun but at the Normal difficulties, I personally think it’s too easy.\n\nDespite this, the game has some minor server lag issues, but I’d say that this is because of people abusing huge maps and making a 2v2v2v2v2 lobby with 10 planets. Obviously there will be some issues, though saying that, the issues are not that bad. Just some response lag (probably 200 – 400ms). And yet another problem is the lack of players, while recently it was on a free giveaway (I didn’t get the game for free, I bought it a year and a half ago), the player base has increased but i doubt it will stay. There hasn’t been an update for about 5 months but there a rumours that a patch is coming out soon for both Pa and Pa:Titans.\n\nOptimisation:\nPersonally I don’t understand the problems some people have with optimisation with this game. My laptop has a core i7 cpu with intel hd 5500 and 8gb of ram and it can play the game at 40 fps in medium settings.\n\nTitans:\nPlanetary Annihilation: Titans is an expansion pack, which costs 13 euros for people who already have the base game, which isn’t bad. The expansion its self, adds around 21 units, I can’t say more about the expansion pack since I haven’t got around to buying it yet.\n\nUber:\nUber entertainment developed the game. Uber is a small company; I doubt that they have anything more that 3-5 employes. This explains the lack of updates. And very few of the players still play the game. According to steamdb, pa (which has sold 1,000,000 copies, but only 73% of that have ever actually played the game), only 8.79% players have played the game in the last 2 weeks, which is not a lot for a multiplayer rts game.\n\nI recommend this game to anybody who likes rts games, it can be played casualy and competitively. I'd ignore most of the negative reviews since they're just reviews from people that have unconditional hatred towards Uber. The game is perfectly fine and will improve if it gets support.\n","March 26","true","49.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Black_Flamingo26/recommended/233250/","Black_Flamingo26","Black Flamingo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Black_Flamingo26/","206 products in account","Planetary Annihilation seems to be a hot button right now for how "Early Access" games should be released. I want to objectively discuss that point, the devs support of the game, and its current state. (build 77443)\n\nFirst off, I want to say that I love this game. I bought this game in earl alpha and have been pretty active with it as I can get with an RTS. The thing about PA is that its not the average RTS. Its not Starcraft, Grey Goo, Etherium, or even Supreme Commander. PA is a huge game, it has no unit cap, and the only 'research' you need for higher teir units is to build the required factory. This structure for an RTS supports a different playstyle.\n\nSo lets look at the simple, "is this game for you?" -myeah-maybe...\n\nThe lack of a tech tree seems to be a deterrent for some, so if you want the slow build up for complicated tactical gameplay, you may need to look a little closer at PA.\n\nI've played this game competitively, casually, with friends, by myself, and pretty much everything. Its possible to set up planets and solar systems, so I've even messed around with scenario games, like all Navy or an Air Force only game with friends. I've genuinely enjoyed all of this. It has offered me my money's worth for sure.\n\nCompetitive: PA is micro-intensive. You need to constantly be checking everything you're trying to do. Camera hotkeys and anchors help with your interplanetary wars. That aside, nearly all competitive matches I've played has gone a T1 battle, between combinations of the T1 units, when the casual really well matched battles can go on for 40 minutes. The 1v1 ranked matches are played on mirrored, pre built maps. I don't see this as a problem, in fact, I welcome it. Most RTS's have this map structure to make the playing field even. Their are plenty of strategies in competitive. Of course you have your META, Aniti-META, Anti-Anti-META, but PA lets you focus on heavy minor strategies like choosing whether you want to bomber harass, build up those turrets, get a more respectable army, rush that early expansion, maybe try all at once and plunge your economy, etc. You can mold your playstyle to fit PA.\n\nCasual: I defiantly wouldn't reccomend PA to anyone who has never played a RTS, and expect them to enjoy thier time. Like any game as micro intensive as this, PA can be a little frusturating to players who stick to fighting the AI. That being said, once you ramp up the AI, it can get pretty-friggin challenging. of course, you can put the AI on normal and toy with them any way you want. The galactic war mode is okay, nothing super new, but you can make a campaign out of it if you want.\n\nWith friends: Really fun if everyone is ready to lose. Teaming up with a few friends to fight 3 bots on the hardest difficulty is a nice experience, full of tears and suffering, and sometimes, triumph. Then killing your friends with 30+ nukes is also interesting. Dynamic Alliances in FFA games make for some interesting real time diplomacy. Really fun game with friends. about 30 hours (i have ~95 at time of posting) is just with friends.\n\nSingleplayer: I don't have much to say after what I've already discussed. Load up a bot game, play the Galactic War mode, run some scenarios. Make it your own.\n\nNow I want to just touch on the aspects of the game that are discussed in about every other review here.\nMusic - Fantastic, want soundtrack. 9/10\nGraphics - Fun artstyle that I personally enjoy, looks great. 8/10\nPersonalization - Purchase the commanders that the backers made (I'll talk about this in the next section.) Commanders are generally nice looking, get to pick your own. No special effects on commanders, e.g. one doesn't have faster build speed or fly. That is nice. 6.5/10\nUI - Used to be jumbled, now much nicer. 9/10\n\nNow lets talk about how the release was handled. I was generally just a spectator because I had already bought the game, but I agree with most people saying that it should not be in 'full release' yet. Constant updates keep coming, and the community is alive. It feels like a finished game at most points, but it can have its issues. Luckily devs are constantly on it. The big fuss about all of this is due to the fact that this was a crowd funded game. This makes people complain when they see that the uniqe, player created commanders cost some money (personally I think a bit too much, but who am I?) but again, crowd funded, they supported first, they have privilages, these kind of games are fres from DAY ONE DLC GET THE GAME EARLY GET SNOOP DOG MARIJUANA GUN PACKS MTN DEWRITOS, so be happy about that. To be honest, I don't really care - but the topic has to be discussed.\n\nEarly access games are a breed of their own, and people need to realize that they aren't going to be done when in development. Some people say PA is still in dvelopment, I wouldn't necessarily disagree, but if the title of 'released' bothers you that much, you may need to go to another game.\n\nBut who cares about all of that? you just want a number. I give it a 7.5/10. I'll keep playing. New things keep popping up, and I like the dev team. Come back and buy it during a sale if you are skeptic. It drops to around 6-7$ so pick it up then if ever.\n\nIf you don't want something where all of the tactics include where you place your base components and how you use your units, and want something a bit slower, but more in-depth - go check out Wargame Red Dragon, Grey Goo, and Etherium. They are all relatively new, look good, and have their own quirks.","January 29, 2015","true","97.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Nearly every detail about this is straight-up Supreme Commander rip-off. What sets it apart is the very cool solar system map style that allows for literally global conflict and, as the title suggests, very satisfying planetary annihilation.\n\nUnfortunately it is very true that the game is buggy. More than once I built rocket boosters on a small moon and launched it into a crash-course with an enemy commander, only to have the two celestial bodies simply vanish on impact (I just pretend they both silently imploded).  When they do successfully collide it will leave a crater half the size of the planet on the target, but units will still be able to build there, floating in the air as if there is no crater at all.\n\nThe graphics need work too. I understand that the scale of the game is enormous, but there are no textures to speak of at all. Supreme Commander looked better.\n\nMy biggest gripe is that the map creator simply DOES NOT WORK. At all. I spent good chunks of time creating my own solar systems to play on, but when I load the maps in-game they are completely different from what I made. The only thing that carries over is the actual name of the system. That really grinds my gears.\n\nHowever, Planetary Annihilation is FUN. That's what matters most to me and that is why I give it my recommendation.","January 29, 2015","true","55.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Explosions, robots, death, robot gore and more explosions because logic! my main quarrel with this game is that you have to have a "beefy computer" in order to not lag as much. When my friend and i attempted playing i ended up crashing his computer forcing a restart of the game/steam. my other problem with the game is that there is way too much to manage when by yourself seeing how you can make infinite troops. (i dont multi-task very well) thats the main reason i play with my friend as it becomes easier to manage your faction with the share army button. An entire match is basically "zerg rush and hope you win" there is some strategy and some counters but very minimal overall. The galactic war seems a bit rigged seeing how you hope to get an AI buddy or a good peice of technology, nope its randomly generated. it would be nice to find two technologies on one planet and choose one of the two instead of a randomly generated technology machine as in some matches in the galactic war seem rigged as your AI enemy gets all the technology (effectivly cheating with nuclear weapons) while if you dont have anything to counter super weapons its GG from beggining. This list could go on forever, but now to what this game does right.\n\nThis game manages to be addicting to come back to even after excruciating losses. The planet creator is a great idea as you can make custom maps for your friends. When i mentioned in the very beggining about the steriotypical american's dream. That means what it sounds like. Constant explosions, lasers everywhere, and a deathstar(esk) annihilaser that makes planets go boom! The concept is very interesting and with the lore's setup it seems primed for a story than just hey you hate these guys kill them. It is extremely fun to see that you can travel between planets and colonize them before your enemies. Then dominate them. Again this list could go on too so here is my rating for this game\n\n7/10","January 30, 2015","true","62.5"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","21","37","2","1"

Scroll a bit with your mouse wheel and you're so zoomed out you can't see anything. You can't find units unless you are zoomed in very far, and meanwhile you're trying to scroll back across your round planet, to find your units, you're getting squashed because it took you a minute to find your troops.\n\nIts too bad - I love RTS games, but unless this gets a lot of improvement, I'm back to Supreme Commander and Sins....sigh, so much lost potential.","June 28, 2014","false","42.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","2"

If you are skilled enough and or think smart, this game has endless possibilities. The controls are smooth once you get used to it, everything just flows. The graphics are excellent and you do not have lag when you have hundreds of units the FPS and game mechanics are optimized fantastically. This game should be way  more popular and i hope it gets the attention it deserves. The best part about this game is that you don't have a CAP on your army. You can have an endless army that's just massive!\n\n\nMy 2nd 1v1 game I played I rocked this dude. he wiped my army out but I had enough time to get a launch pad and get my commander to the Planetary destroyer planet or what ever its called. I got him there and immediately expanded resources and massed bombers and executed planet wide patrols so this guy could not land on my planet.. well I accidentally over looked a small part of the planet were he was able to plant a teleportation building and transferred at least 400 to 500 units. I immediately gathers all bombers and fighters, I positioned all my fighters to go in first and take the first wave of AA attacks then sent in my bombers in one quick strafe run my bombers took out ALL of the units and destroyed the teleportation device I immediately beefed up on my orbital patrol units and what ever he sent in after I destroyed and this was on going until i finally gained control of my Planetary destroyer.\n\nHe mass sent at least 6 to 7 nukes but luckily I knew he was going to do that because it was just commons sense he had no other options or crash his planet into mine.  so i made ANTI nuke missile's. GG his planet was wiped and I win and he raged. turned out he was like over 100 plus games in and it was my 2nd. GLORIOUS!  This game has endless possibilities and you will always have something to counter anyone's military so choose wisely.\n\nBest part about that battle was my orbital scout made it to his planet before I blew it up and he had at LEAST 300 orbital bombers. if he made it to my planet I would have lost.","February 7, 2015","true","39.6"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","1"

I've played many titles like ZZ Soldier, Starcraft, Heroes of Might & Magic, Age of Empires, Civilization & Alpha Centari, Homeworld and etc. The one title that seemed to steal my soul was Total Annihilation.\n\nYou might be uhhh I've never heard of that title. Was that a starcraft knockoff? Not even quite. Yea it was futuristic but that was it. It was one of the first fully 3d strategy game even if they had to secure the camera view to overhead because of deisgn problems and being overcomplicated. (TAspring is what it would have been like..) Every fired projectile had physics afffecting it and the cpu would track it + million other processes. There's more to say here but Im cutting it short. I spend days online on the boneyard ( in game multiplayer service which I've never seen the likes of before and still to this day have not) then Mplayer, then when that service crashed I spent my remainder days on Game Spy Arcade when not using tcp/ip connections with clan mates. This was an early game that made it easier to mod and accepted modding, which popped my mod cherry. To my dismay I never knew a game could be changed like that by a user!\n\nThen Supreme Commander came out which Chris Taylor the project lead of TA started that with some of the old crew of Cavedog (developer of TA) made another great addition to the franchise. Even though there was more to be improved but I spent a stupid amount of my young adult life playing it 19 to present(26).\n\nNow you have Planetary Annihilation. Alot of people from primordial ages of Cavedog and the newer employees from Gas Powered Games are making a new love child of Total Annihilation.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alfrelvaz/recommended/233250/","alfrelvaz","Alfrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alfrelvaz/","574 products in account","So I bought this game and actually enjoyed it, it's a solid RTS with mechanics never seen before, it has Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander spirit, but lacks in some of the good aspects of both those games. However, it does some things that those previous titles did not. You might say this should be a positive review. But it's not.\n\nI bought this game back in the last summer sale. I've been wanting to get it since it was announced in kickstarter but the exchange rate in my country is quite steep (multiply by 10 every price you see here) and I had to wait for a sale and for it to be "finished" and/or "polished" enough to merit the purchase. Keep in mind that I'm not a fan of Early Access and all that it implies (paying for a game without the guarantee that it'll be finished or it will deliver what was promised).\n\nYesterday UBER launched TITANS (the unannounced "expansion" that  doesn't expand anything  because it's standalone) which for us that bought the original PA is literally a big finger in all orifices. You might say "but hey, you get a discount!" yeah... I get a 66% discount that leaves a $40 game (that I already own) at DLC price, with the knowledge that if I don't buy it  I will never get an update  on that same game (vanilla PA)  AT ALL . And I don't mean those Titan units and whatnot. I mean actual performance, bug, optimization fixes and updates. Basically all I get from this is that they discontinued support UNLESS I buy the game again. This could've been a DLC and noone would be ranting like this. But no, rebuy the game, guys.\n\nThat's the worst business ethics I've seen in a while, and even worse the "standalone DLC/Update" Titans is getting good reviews for some reason. I hope the press doesn't keep praising it and consumers don't buy into this company's ways of treating us. I for one, will pirate it if I ever want to play it, these guys won't get a dime from me again. If you plan to buy Titans, do so, i'm sure it's good, but do it with caution, you never know what Uber might pull in the future.","August 19, 2015","false","24.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

They've just released PA:Titans - which is the same basic game, plus a few more units - essentially what would be a $5 DLC for any other game.

Not like many games, this game is regularly updated and sharing news and polls.\n\nRight now, it’s obvious that this game still needs some work. Some of the AI of the units and commander itself needs some improvements, some rendering issues here and there, and other bugs can be fixed.\n\nThough, despite the known issues, this is a very good looking game. Rendering and the lighting in this game is remarkable, and I haven't seen such great lighting in games for a while now until I came across this one. The aspect of this game is fun, and easy to get used too, and single player can be fun as well, as long as you have an internet connection.\n\nSo, at its current stage, it is playable, but do expect to see some bugs and issues yourself.\nTherefore, I recommend this game for those of you who are familiar with RTS games, and those of you who don't expect too highly in games like these.\n\n- Blue\n\n\n\nRemember: to those of you who are thinking twice, this game is indeed need of improvements, but Uber Entertainment is already working on these issues.

The hook isn't death stars or planet-smashing - the hook is that this the only RTS with strategic zoom on spherical maps.\n\nSpherical maps! I can't overemphasize how much of a game-changer these are! One you experience a battle not on one front, not on multple fronts, but on multiple connected circular fronts, you'll have a hard time going back to your standard flat-map RTS fare.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that it looks gorgeous too. And there's a stripped down, focused tech tree that makes every unit unique and useful (no experimental spam here). And there's even a thriving mod scene with a 1-click-to-install mod database app to go along with it. Not to mention built-in multiplayer hosting, matchmaking, and a global replay library. Oh yeah, AND death stars and planet smashing.\n\nI picked this up for cheap at the last sale with low expectations - knowing only that it was generally considered unfinished. Liked what I found enough to buy a bunch of useless in-game commander skins to support continued updates. I definitely underpaid up front for the amount of fun I'm having, and there are more updates coming!\n\nThere's some rough edges and features still missing, but the core game is all that counts and that's where PA shines.

Imagine walking into this with out any idea of most of the GUI means, what does what, or how to even get off a planet if you are in a system with multiple planets.\n\nOh sure, there is a how to but it essentially amounts to a less detail version of an old apogee game's instructions and is essential "move from world to world, collect tech, some tech can be used in future games when you lose" . um, ok, how about how the f do I get off the planet to attack the other commander? You can tell this was meant for the hardcore rts vets.\n\nWell, mostly. The planets are dull and lifeless. Hate to compare it starcraft but starcraft at least made it look like there were signs of life at one point on their planets. Such as bones of dead creatures, planet life, etc.  Even had occasional packs of fauna roaming about. Here, it's just you and the enemy.\n\nThe worlds themselves are mostly flat, with the occasional plateau that you can't climb or land on.\nHaven't run into any water worlds yet  played 5-10 matches and    most of what I get is arid desert and what I think are metal worlds? not sure.\n\nThe A.I pathing for your units is horrendous. I try to send my units to scout 200yrd away and they take 5 minutes to get there taking some absurd trail to get there when all the had to do was go slightly  to the left,  It's worse with larger groups, I mean if you need them to move to a point attack they blob up and make the pathing worse and   heaven forbid\nif you have to target a specific structure like turrets. They will ignore the command and do their own thing, just attacking everything BUT the target you want most times.\n\nThe units aside from your commander are kind of hard to tell apart at times. cept the scouts since they are smaller that other units.\n\nThe good: The graphics are sharp. The overall concept is fun if poorly executed, The commander units do look interesting though there is a ton you have to buy as dlc for 5-10$ per commander.  In all fairness you do get 6 to start.\nThe background music is really good.  I do like the idea of new worlds giving tech that can increase your chances of success in future battles.\n\nMy issue is that despite it having an interesting core concept it's not all that accessible to new players.  The only reason I had any clue of what was going on was because I've played other rts games and even then I was still clueless on a lot of gameplay elements. You are left in the dark with poor A.I pathing, somewhat unbalanced gameplay (pro-tip build a ton of anti-air, think you have enough, well, you don't trust me)  At it's heart it's not a bad game, but it's not really a good one either.","May 16, 2015","false","1.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Contact on the moon. In fact a whole mother♥♥♥♥ing swarm is on the other side of the moon. He got their too and stealthed up a proxy base - I should've had roaming scouts on that ♥♥♥♥.\nSo I get a good force through the teleport and start building some T2 (Tier 2) anti-air stations on the moon.\nThen I think, ♥♥♥♥, I bet he moved his commander on to the moon! He's vulnerable!\nSo I get a nuke going, send a couple scouts out to find the commander but they're instantly shot before they can see enough.\nI send a few T2 vehicles on their way to their proxy moon base so that they can clean up.\nI fire the nuke, it hits. My three or four T2 vehicles get there. It's ground zero, BUT, a mother♥♥♥♥ing "Austreus" is dropping THE AI'S COMMANDER ONTO THE MOON. He had JUST begun to arrive when the nuke hit.\nI'm like ♥♥♥♥! This is it! My vehicles start shooting him but he ♥♥♥♥ing lays into them and the small group ♥♥♥♥ing blows up!\nSo i'm like ♥♥♥♥! Here come the cavalry! I send EVERYTHING I have on my moon base toward him, then I realize... they're all T2 vehicles: aka slow as ♥♥♥♥.\nThey get there to find... THE MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING COMMANDER SLINKING HIS WAY INTO A TELEPORT HE'D JUST BUILT. BACK TO THE HOME BASE. THAT ♥♥♥♥. OMFG. I'd murder.\nMy home base is still well fortified and I've amassed quite a T2 army but he still controls most of the MEX.\nSo i'm real ♥♥♥♥♥♥ now. But I have an idea. I want to lure the commander back, so I leave their teleport on the moon\nGet another nuke going. And periodically scout their proxy moon base.\nSure enough, they start rebuilding it. But the Commander is still no where to be seen.\nI'M TRYING TO COAX HIM OUT BUT HE JUST DOESNT ♥♥♥♥ING COME.\nSo I'm like that's it ♥♥♥♥♥. I'm coming to you.\nMy nuke is ready. They probably have anti-nukes - but ♥♥♥♥ IT. On the off chance they don't, I want his head on a platter served to be by some guy with a French accent offering his finest wine to massage my pallet.\nOkay, I try to scout the location on the main planet so I can find the Command and aim my nuke accordingly but but again none of them get through. I fire the nuke pretty blind, with my army on the edge, ready to rush in once it's landed.\nThe nuke weaves through the orbits and lands on the AI's base.\nMy guys rush in... slowly... because they're largely T2 vehicles. They mow down everything in their path.\nFind the commander. He is severely damaged. And WHAT do you think that ♥♥♥♥ER is doing? HE'S BUILDING ANOTHER MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING TELEPORT. TRYING TO GET TO THE MOON.\nNOT THIS TIME ♥♥♥♥.\nMy force wipes the floor with him.\nThe mushroom cloud is satisfying.\nI then realize how much I got emotionally invested in the persual of his demise.\nGame ends at 70 minutes.\n9/11 would play again.","February 6, 2015","true","35.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Really fun action packed RTS game unlike no other. I have noticed a lot of bad reviews but 95% of bad things I have read about the game have been fixed in recent updates (such as the save game feature). The game is constantly being updated with bug fixes and other changes.\n\nSingle player is fun and challenging -> in galactic war you start with basically nothing but as you take over planets in the galaxy you find upgrades. You can also play skirmish against the AI which can be fun and challenging especially for beginners.\n\nOnline you can play 1v1 ranked matches or play custom matches where you can play massive FFA or team games and just about anything else you want with whoever you want.\n\nThe game is made to be easily modded so there are a lot of mods that are really easy to download. You can even get mods that just about change the entire way the game is played. You can also download and play on planets other people have made or make your own planet(s).\n\nThere are still a few small annoying bugs in the game, it often crashes and it helps to have a good PC but these are not major problems. I’m not playing on a very good PC so I can’t play games with more than about 3 planets but that doesn't make the game less fun and it is very easy to avoid games with a lot of planets.\n\nYou can smash planets together and build death stars. What else could you possibly want in a game? Massive battles across a solar system? Great balance and gameplay? Well you have these things too and much more. :)","March 29, 2015","true","343.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Thanks to Uber Entertainment, I will never Kickstart another game. For some reason, Uber decided to split the community up by creating a new stand-alone game called Titans, therefore the Vanilla version is completely dead and is no longer supported or updated. The game is still riddled with bugs: achievements do not unlock, cannot build in 5th Catalyst spot, units freeze up and do not respond, terrible pathfinding, etc.). As well as the game has terrible performance and terrible AI. By the way, you have to always be connected to their servers in order to play the game, and their servers have been down which you are out of luck if you want to play. The overall gameplay feels like this game should be $20 at most, and not the $40/$50 pricetag they are trying to sell it for. The gameplay at times is very stagnant and bland, however the musical score is excellent and it's a shame that such beautifully orchestrated music is in such a terrible game. There is no campaign, however there is a Galatic War mode which essentially is just a bunch of random skirmishes tied together with the player starting off with little to no technology and after every battle you will slowly increase your technology. After a few battles in Galatic War mode it's the same thing over and over and becomes very tedious. Finally, the loading time is ridiculously long for games in this day and age - it literally takes more than a couple of minutes to populate the world and to load your commander in. Do yourself and everyone a favor and skip this game, it's not worth it at all.","March 5","false","8.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

DRM DROPS THE GAME IN SINGLE PLAYER MODE.\n\nTotal annihalation this is not... although you can tell it is trying to be it. I can see how this game could be fun... the idea is great and they have streamlined the units to remove a lot of the useless teirs that was found in Supreme Commander. It is also easy to tell that they intended for wars to be quick and only last around 30 minutes or so. I was playing against the AI on extreme mode (1 level above hard but not on master mode which is supposed to be slightly harder) and i was able to have 6 nukes going within 15 minutes (among other countless units) and won the game before 20 minutes (this was an example of me turtling). Just to warn you, if you are a quick strategy gamer, this game is really easy (at least against AI). When i ran a series of power play tests, the hard AI's didn't even come close to providing a challenge (i didn't try against master AI because i got bored). I simply spammed level one factories, ground units (tanks and some AA trucks) and teir 1 power plants/ metal extractors and charged the commander with around 50 units or so. BOOOOOOM. I just put up some turrets and SAMS around my base  to prevent the AI planes and pathetic death squads and I always win within 10-15 minutes.\n\nBUT...\n\nThis game does not feel finished even though it has been released. I deliberately didn't install this game until the release because i knew the bugs would ruin it. I have encountered crashes to the desktop, strange graphical artifacts, the instructions given to units are not always followed (individual units do not always move/fire when told. Build orders are not always followed even when their is plenty of space for the building, even when the build order is queued) and the most annoying thing: SERVER CONNECTION LOSS CAUSES THE DRM TO DROP THE GAME... EVEN IN SINGLE PLAYER MODE. I will admit that the DRM really did cause me to rage quit the application... although i did go back to the game the next day and spent a few hours in it without any DRM issues (most likely because my connection didn't hicup).\n\nI have really tried to get into the game because i love these type of games usually. The trouble is, this just feels... crap. The graphics make the game feel like it should be run of a tablet computer, not a hardcore PC. I know that their are a lot of physics calculations going on and that these take priority over graphics but why are the textures so awful. I will admit that I did chuckle when my nuke missile launched and then flew around my planet backwards, I'm taking that as  compensation for the frustration i encounted when i had to order it to fire around 6 times before it fired. I also have a major problem with the fact that the blueprint snapping breaks constantly so that thet base building feels like a constant battle with the UI (yes I like my bases to look nice sometimes).\n\nIf this game had remained in Beta status, i would forgive it... but it has been launched in a state which isn't fit for purpose so i have uninstalled it and am now leaving this review to warn others... I believe it could eventually be good... after about another years worth of development... but i don't recommend it in it's current state and do not support this level of DRM out of principle.","September 8, 2014","false","7.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hyperdeathkill/recommended/233250/","hyperdeathkill","Killbam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hyperdeathkill/","90 products in account","Planetary Annihilation is a giant, half baked, cluster♥♥♥♥ that fails to deliver on the promise of its predecessors and is a slap in the face to all the people who funded it through Kickstarter.\n\nUber entertainment seems to be run by the marketing department, asking itself the question, "How do I make a game go viral?" instead of asking, "How do I make a good game that will go viral?" There's livestreaming integration via Twitch along with ample controls to shoutcast and record matches, and the ability to add extensions and mods, but the core parts of game are severely under developed.\n\nPlanetary Annihilation has failed the basics. For instance, rebinding a key shows a developer error message. Commanders will spawn sometimes extremely close to each other. Pathfinding is poor. There's no option to save Multiplayer games, and practically speaking, there's no instructions. The only "tutorial" is an old YouTube video that's sounds like an advertisement and is so basic it won't be of use to anyone. It is so bad even the dwindling community has expressed creating an extension themselves to add tips into the game.\n\nSpeaking of the community, less than three weeks after its release there are only a handful of multiplayer matches and PA's price has dropped significantly on steam, both of which are indicators that this is a failure of a game. Outside of the game Uber hasn't even provided things like stats, or tech trees, and the poor suckers who bought the game for full price are expected to add that knowledge to the Internet themselves.\n\nThis ties into the biggest problem: usability. PA takes place in a solar system where you can hop planets, but the planets are tiny King Kai planets, so you can only see half of your planet at a time like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fog of war. There is a picture-in-picture mode, but not dual monitor support. The lack of tips means that after several games, many of us people didn't even know what planet they were on, much less how to get off it and launch an invasion. When you run into an army, the name of the person to whom it belongs isn't even shown. I couldn't figure out how teleporters worked until someone told me several matches later, and figuring out how nukes works is an exercise in random clicking. I landed on a planet, I think it was a gas planet, which means I can mine it? I don't know.\n\nThis is coming from someone who has played both Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander/2 and was willing to buy Planetary Annihilation on pedigree alone.\n\nUsability is super important when there is a lot going on and there is more going on in PA than ever. PA builds on its predecessors main tech trees of Vehicle, Naval, Bots, and Air with a third (fifth?) dimension of Orbital and the inclusion of different planets on which to wage war. A (real, not space) Navy seems kind of useless on tiny King Kai planets, and the purpose of bots still overlaps with vehicles. Not that I was expecting a TA/SupCom/2/PA game to get rid of bots, but that Kickstarter stretch goal to include Naval units? Bad idea and worse implementation.\n\nGames are enormous and sprawling, with hundreds of units and structures. Zooming out reduces the units to icons, which are another failed attempt to fix the problem. They glitchly overlap, and look the same. If you were designing an UI to move icons around, you'd probably at least make them different colors.\n\nWhile most of the time you're watching little icons come into, and blink out of existence, it's not like you'd actually enjoy the graphics anyway. There's only one faction in PA, and all the units look like toys. And I mean the type of toys you give to toddlers; the designs are generic and strangely clean for weapons of war. I'm not expecting Warhammer 40k levels of grit, but the unit designs look like something a Freshman graphics student would turn in for solid B. The Supreme Commander 2 units looked more detailed and just... better.\n\nTo be fair, there are some innovative selection features: highlighting an area will only select combat units and not builder units, you can click and drag areas to have fabricators build a lot of things, and... well that's all I've discovered after reading up all I could on the Internet and playing.\n\nWhen all this is tied to the underhanded fact that Uber sold this game in stores for full price while still in "Early Access" (which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because if anybody can access it then it's not "early") and the fact that there's expensive DLC already, I can only feel sorry for the the people duped into Kickstarting Uber's salaries.","September 24, 2014","false","7.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Get the damn game.\n\nThis game is very frustrating, decently unbalanced, and has a steep learning curve.  However, the concept is phenominal. Being a huge RTS fan, this has to be one RTS game that truly stands out to me.  It looks beautiful and I'd say it's revolutionary as far as gameplay mechanics.\nThe game isn't finished.  It still needs a lot of work in it's current state.  I was surprised to find that it's in a released version and not still in beta after playing for a bit.  Despite the game being nowhere close to finished, it's on the right track.\nThe only problems tha stand out to me are the balancing issues and lack of variety.  Different units for different factions would be sweet - like in C&C.  Every match seems to be a spam fest with who can send more bots to the other base first.  Defensive towers can't do much against a wave of 200 bots. (But, it DOES look pretty damn cool.)\nAside from the game being somewhat buggy and unbalanced, I have hope in it.  Stretching gameplay onto multiple planets and even adding an orbital layer makes for a great concept.  The game needs to be developed further so the it can be truly fleshed out to it's full potential.\n\nWith the minor faults aside, this a game is a good time.

Look no further.  This game revolutionizes the RTS genre.  Instead of square maps you have spherical ones.  No longer can you get in a corner and only worry about two directions.  People can attack from all 360 degrees of your base.  Most RTS have one map per game.  In PA battle grounds are actual one to many planets in a solar system.  The size of the game is staggering.  There are a lot of different kinds of units.  There are vehicles, bots, air, naval, and orbital.  There are nukes, HUGH engines you can use to smash one planet into another, and metal planets can basically be turned into death stars.  On top of all of this you have procedurally generated solar systems and planets as well as a built in system designer for creating your own planets and solar systems.  The objective of the game is to kill the other opponent(s) commander(s).  If your commander is killed then you lose.  So just as in chess you must keep him protected.  Early game he is a powerful unit, late game he is a liability.\n\nSingle player.  Know first that this game started as a multiplayer that got single player features added in.  You basically have two options.  AI Skirmish and Galactic War. AI Skirmish in which you fight it out against one or more AIs, all of which can be adjust for difficulty level.  Galactic War is a randomly generated galaxy that you can adjust the size of at the start of the game.  You take your commander and hop from system to system and try to conquer the whole galaxy.  Die and it is over.  No two play throughs will ever be the same.\n\nMultiplayer. Up to 10 players currently (this will be increase with future updates) can duke it out over a solar system.  You can do FFA or team games.  With FFA there are options to have dynamic alliances where you can basically on the whim in the game team up and backstab your other opponents. With Team games you can share armies and economies or simply a team for victory.\n\nFuture Updates.  We expect there to be a lot of competitive things like match making and ladders to be added in as well as the number of players increase.  We also expect Galactic war will be made possible for multiplayer for clan wars.  The devs have made it clear that they mean to keep supporting by creating updates for a long time.\n","September 7, 2014","true","427.2"," 46 of 87 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","46","87","0","2"

Planetary Annihilation, to me, feels like the groundwork for the perfect game. Let me list some pros and cons and you'll see what I mean.\n\nThe Good- You can smash planets together!\n- You can use a Deathstar-like planet to blow up other planets with a laser beam!\n- You can design your own systems with plenty of collision and laser-ready planets\n- Many different ways of attacking and defending. From land units, naval, air units, orbital, and nuclear, it becomes very interesting to try and tear a hole through someone's defenses. When you're dealing with multiple planets, things can fall out of your favor by overlooking a certain defense, but the same thing can apply for your enemies.\n\nThe Bad- THE LAG!!! Anyone who has touched this game will know that it eats at computer memory like a homeless monkey in a banana store. On top of it not being optimized graphically, there is currently no such thing as a true single-player game. All games, even if you are playing by yourself, are hosted on one of three different servers throughout the world. This leads to some ridiculous load times, and tons of latency while playing the game.\n- Bare-bones tech. Tier 1 and Tier 2 buildings and units. That's it. On top of that, there are no different races. Everyone has access to the exact same units and technology, which is unheard of in the RTS market. Somehow there is enough diversity that games are still fun, but I can't even imagine how much more amazing this game could be with some variation.\n\nOverall, I would recommend purchasing this game, but do it when it's on sale, like I did. The game is fun but feels incomplete. Don't pay full price.","February 3, 2015","true","131.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

However at any price with this performance, I cannot recommend it. The game has completely froze on me 6 times in the 4 or 5 hours ive been playing. Units need constant babysitting as they tend to want to stop doing any action halfway through its completion, (Generally building and moving positions), they also tend to just wander off and do their own thing. Lag is constant and joining in on a multiplayer match was impossible for me unless I hosted it myself. The A.I is ball drainingly difficult even on normal, as the first fight I encountered took 3 or 4 tries, each attempt taking 15-20 mins to complete. Nothing is explained as virtually everything has changed since the tutorial beside from right click to walk. changing from one unit to the next can also prove difficult because if not done correctly your unit may stop what it was doing and move to the random spot you clicked, which can prove quite frustrating when done over and over. Which is a great way to describe the game, click the building you want built, or location you want your troops to travel to 100 ♥♥♥♥in times (or it wont get done) as the game lags uncontrolably taking ten minutes for you to walk to the enemy base.

I can't recommend this game because it STILL isnt a finished product writing this in October 2014.  Luckily I have a gaming PC, with a lot of expensive hardware, but I feel that typically most systems will not be able to run this game smoothly because of the poor utilization in-game. It is RAM extensive and CPU extensive as-well. There was a point in-time where the Devs were motivated and updating the game, now it seems they have lost that motivation and are packing up and moving on to the next game. In essence they've abandoned this game, I don't see this game ever meeting it's potential either.\n\nOne of the concepts of this game is traveling the galaxy and expanding, there are no space battles on the galaxy map, only fixed movement trails when you send spacecraft to other planets. Another concept is the borderless strategy at play, it isn't a conventional RTS where the map is flat, you play on a spherical world, there are pros and cons to this, but I find that it is too poorly utilized and needs to be worked on. For example for people who like to turtle or play defensively it is impossible to build an adequate defense because of the spherical world, they need to encourage defensive type gameplay as-well and not just one type of gameplay. I think that they need to make the spherical worlds larger so the gameplay is more flatter like a convential RTS however once you run off the the screen you can move around the planet freely in the spherical concept they have already integrated. So it will have a conventional RTS feel, but also incorperate the spherical concept as-well to make a outstanding RTS game.\n\nPros:\nIt's an RTS game\nMultiplayer Based\nLarge Scale Battles\n\nCon:\nCan't fight in outerspace\nCan't Micro Very Well In This Game Compared To Conventional RTS Games\nCampaign? Should I even call it that...\nSmall community due to game being rubbish\nGUI experience is like groping a pineapple.\nGraphics, Unit Modeling, was drawn up and conceived by a pre-school class.\n\n\nThis game will genuinely dissapoint you upon buying it.

Have interplanetary duels with nukes or send heaps of moon rocks to completely annihilate their planet. Unit cap is 10,000 units. "wait what!?" is probably what you are thinking and yes you can have a max of 10.000...per PLAYER! :O. That is a 10x improvement over supreme commanders unit cap and that game had enormous battles.\n\nUnfortunately there are shortcomings that can overshadow the amazing feats Planetary Annihilation is boasting. The game can crawl to a complete stop on loading planets, watch your fps drop dramatically every now and again, A.I is horrendous if you start on another planet and they can't reach you, your commander may glitch and get stuck depending on the planets geometry (for example stuck on a corner of a hill/mountain etc) and lastly for me I feel as though strategic missiles have lost their destructive capabilities that they had in suppreme commander and now are just miniscule dust clouds that do absoultely nothing to the enemy.\n\nDespite these flaws Planetary Annihilation is still in gamma stage and I have faith in uber entertainment to address these issues and are already doing a superb job at fixing issues. When I first heard about this game I had my doubts that it could be done . On the other hand upon playing it and finally having the chance to experience large scale battles on a unprecedented scale in the Rts genre I have to say congratulations to the developers that made my dream Rts game a reality.

The engineering bots don't help building and repairing stuff while you are fighting.

While the game is now a '3D planet' the gameplay is unmistakably 2D and unlike many old maps there's no real bottlenecks or impassable terrain beyond random water placement or small jutting pieces of rock. There is literally no challenge from the AI and near zero meaning to your own base: just spamming factories; no defensive lines or support structures really: everything is liquid (which could be good) but nothing has customisation or choice like SupCom's tech or upgrading mechanics. I imagine it's an alright game multiplayer but it is truly lacking depth in comparison to SupCom with respect to it's abysmal 'campaign/adventure' mode, it's current AI's strategies and outrageously fickle gameplay.\n\nI have tried it at multiple stages of the beta but only managed 55 minutes of interest for a £20 game. For someone who wants to enjoy this as mostly a singleplayer game it is nothing in comparison to SupCom or TA. There just seems to be a lack of fun in it since you effectively do the same thing each game with the lack of factions, tech or experimentals. The only unique thing about the game is commanding relatively unresourceful moons to crash but in reality this is just another form of a nuke and is not half as important as 10 factories.","September 23, 2014","false","2.6"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

Nothing else comes close.\n\nLearning lessons from their past games (Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander), the developers have reinvented this style of RTS with a completely new paradigm: inter-planetary warfare, which means spherical maps (no hiding in corners), and the ability to destroy entire planets. In this new spiritual successor, the interface and economy have both been streamlined and simplified, while still keeping to their original spirit. The elimination of micromanagement has been a fundamental design goal from the beginning, and the developers have largely succeeded.\n\nOne of the most significant features is the Chrono Cam, which gives the ability to jump to any point in a replay, or even a game that you're still playing. You can go back and forward in time, and even play the game in reverse. It's seamless and works extremely well. This Chrono Cam, in its entirety, is something that no other game studio has ever made.\n\nThe game can be difficult at first, and there is a high bar for multiplayer gameplay, but there is an excellent integrated replay system that will let you watch anyone's games, even the top-tier ranked games, so you can improve rapidly.\n\nThe interface is extremely powerful, which moves the emphasis away from micro-management to macro. This gives the greatest thinkers an advantage over the fastest clickers. This focus separates this game from most other real-time strategies, making it more about higher-order planning than quick reaction time.\n\nThe strategies can get quite diverse with 4 "planes" of combat: Land, Water, Air and Orbital. I often end up fighting battles on multiple planets simultaneously in bigger games, but if this isn't your thing, you can limit your play to small single-planet systems.\n\nIf you liked Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander, but are looking for a game with the potential for longevity, you'll find it here. If you've never heard of those games and are in to the RTS genre, you'll find this completely different from anything you've seen before.\n\nI've been waiting 15 years for this game, and I'm really happy with how it turned out.","May 14, 2015","true","190.4"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","15","27","0","1"

I really love RTS games, and this one gives me the impression that it will be superb. The problem is, I just won't play a game that isn't finished, and this one clearly isn't.\n\nTake this for example. I try to play it on my super powerful computer, and the screen flashes like crazy. It doesn't flicker, it flashes from pitch black to normal screen, and repeat. Turns out this is an error with the game and NVidia, so I'm forced to play it on my less powerful machine.\n\nSo seeing as I had just sat through the intro video, I click the mouse so that I can skip it. It doesn't skip it, forcing me to watch it a second time, but I suddenly hear people talking in the background. It turns out that what appears to be a YouTube video is overlayed in the background, and my clicking suddenly started it playing, so I'm listening to the developers chatting about their game!\n\nI check out the tutorials, expecting to see one in which you play along, and it teaches you as you go, but instead a video appears, with the most annoying voice over man ever explaining it. I'm not in the mood to listen to someone repeat how "amazing" and "incredible" the game is, as well as try to absorb and remember everything at once, so I skip it. I've played dozens of hours of Supreme Commander, so how hard can this game be?\n\nI click on single player, and start the galactic war. Pick a planet to do battle on, and I'm in the game. I'm off running around, building things, finding it odd that when you click and drag turrets, the gap is massive (in SupCom you could connect one to another), when suddenly a voice tells me I need more energy storage.\n\nThis is where I get fed up. I have no energy storage buildings. I assume I have to unlock them in Galactic mode, but if that's a very odd thing to limit you on. I'm on one planet, the AI is on another, so I assume I need to build some kind of flying unit, but I'm limited to land and boat. I then try out the teleporter building, but can't use it, so I build another one thinking it's a point to point building, but that doesn't work either.\n\nAfter 15 minutes to aimless clicking, I eventually tab out to go look at a tutorial, and all I can find are videos of the beta, which look very different to what I'm playing, so I switch back to the game, which is now running at a snails pace. I get bored, quit the game, and suddenly my machine is also running at the same slow pace, resulting in me holding down the power button to turn it off.\n\nIt's not the PC, I should add. I can play all sorts of games on max, and the new Wolfenstein on High.\n\nThe game WILL be good... but they should not have considered it finished just yet.\n\nYou can't save during skirmish games, and you need to sign up and log in to play.

Whilst it is quicker to connect to Uber’s servers than it was before it is still quite slow.  Even setting up a single player skirmish or a joining a battle in Galactic conquest takes time on top of the log in DRM.   My steam tells me that I have 21 hours in game, although I disagree, It is more likely to be 5 + hours of me trying to get past the Login in DRM and then another hour of me trying to get past other loading screens.\n\nThe game is also rather difficult to pick up an still lacks  a proper tutorial and there is a lot of features thrown in your face.  The best way to learn how to play is to play the galactic war because that way you can take it step by step.\n\nHowever the game does have some great systems and mechanics, and so many of the units/building are really nice.  The naval units are really well designed, although I they are not as used as much as I would like.  The Gas giants are a really call concept, and the wide variety of units is really good.  The AI can be tricky to beat at first because of its ability to multitask but once you know what to do the AI is beatable.  On the whole the gameplay is solid and quite enjoyable.\n\nAesthetically the game isn’t the prettiest game but it isn’t ugly and the graphics work this sort of game so it is fine.  On the other hand the full orchestral sound track is great, and it really suits the game.\n\n\n\nIf you buy the game make sure you have a reliable internet connection and don’t have to worry about 3rd party fire walls.  If you want an epic sic-fi RTS, then this game is for you, just make sure you understand the game is heavily affected by always online DRM, still has a couple of bugs, and that the game can be quite crashy.  And be prepared to wait to get past loading screens.","September 7, 2014","false","34.7"," 22 of 41 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","22","41","0","0"

The price might be a little high for your likings, but it's to help this game grow and update faster and release sooner. In my opinion, it is well worth the price because not only do you get access to the beta and future releases, but also some neat treats like sound tracks and a unique in-game commander at the release. This game offers great real time strategic fun and it can be a great way to pass the time. Sure it has its problems like being a heavy game to run, and needing internet to play, as it is a server gased game at the moment, but it is still in beta and it will improve and eventually fix these problems when time comes.

Ever. It combines everything I want to see in a game into, well, a game. Specifically one I like. But for some reason, not EVERYONE shares my views on EVERYTHING ( I know, weird, right?), so here is a compilation of why PA is awesome, and the problems it still has.\n\nPA has no unit cap. None at all. You can build 4000 factories and with those factories infinitely spam out units if you so wanted, and the game would not stop you. In fact, the only thing standing in your way, is either:\na) your computer\nb) your internet\nc) the server you just killed by building over 10000 units and trying to get them to do something.\n\nPA (now) has singleplayer offline mode. Yes, you can play offline now. The only problem is you need a rig that meets the reccommended requirements to get a reasonable experience.\n\nPA has interplanetary warfare and interaction. Ever wanted to fling a planet at someone? Well now you can. There are litterally no downsides here.\n\nPA is incredibly moddable. You can make whole new units/balances/metas/UIs/Biomes for PA. Once again, no downsides.\n\nPA is a macro-oriented game. It's more about base-building and army management than click-spammy micro where whoever clicks the best and fastest wins. In PA, you need to be good at strategy, assess your opponent's weaknesses before he discovers yours and strike from an unexpected side, or two sides, or from space. If you love SC2 because of its micro and want something similar in all your RTS games, this isn't really the game you're looking for.\n\nPA has a somewhat steep learning curve, unless you've played similar games before. (TA, SupCom, SupCom FA, etc.) It also has effectively no tutorial, so you need to play for a few hours (preferably against a freind, the AI is pretty mean to new players) before you start understanding what's going on. After that, it is a highly enjoyable game.\n\nPA has a competetive ranked system (just implemented) it's a fun way to prove yourself against others! Not as fleshed out as it could be, but we're looking forward to more improvements in the coming months. Also, if more players played ranked, we'd have a better ranked system simply due to population density.\n\nPA's Devs are highly invested in the game and are constantly talking with the community on their forums. PA has a great community, and great community-dev interaction (I think we can all thank Jables for this!).\n\nAll in all, I'd give this game an 8.5/10. Yeah that's right, my favorite game of all time got a 8.5 out of 10, even I can see that there are issues with it. Although it's a little buggy at times (mostly if your drivers are out of date), it's not completely balanced yet, and the UI in some cases could use a decent bit of work, it is the only game I own where I consistently come back to it week after week and constantly take part in the community. I would highly reccomend this game if you are into this kind of RTS.","October 11, 2013","true","326.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Однако сложной в исполнении. Благодаря большой свободе действий и большом количестве построек и юнитов вы можете сыграть в РА сотню раз и каждый раз использовать разную стратегию. Пожертвовав одиночной компанией разработчики дали игрокам такую свободу действий, которой не было в любой другой стратегии в реальном времени:вы можете создать наимощнейший танковый парк или огромный флот, который окажет незаменимую поддержку при штурме укрепленной базы противника, а может оказаться так, что рандом выкинет "финт ушами" и планета будет полностью покрыта льдом и придется полагаться на сухопутные и воздушные войска и тому подобное, также в игре присутсвуют орудия массового поражения: от ядерных боеголовок до изменения орбиты естественного спутника планеты и обрушения всей этой мощи на менее развитого противника. Конечно же не обошлось и без минусов, начиная долгими загрузками локации и заканчивая вылетами игры. Также разработчики перестарались с игровым ИИ. Если на среднем уровне можно изловчиться и выйграть, то на самой высокой сложности вы еще не раз всплакнете над обломками своего командира.

If you don't have a stable internet and a good computer you won't be able to play it. You will need internet connection even in offline mode. But despite that (that will say if you don't have any problem with this) this game is a really cool game, I mean smashing a planet into an even even bigger planet to Annihilate it's citisens is so awsome. You could play this game for hours thanks to it's awsomnes. Want fire? build flame tanks. Want to conquest the galaxy? play Galactic War. Want cheese? go to a planets moon.

So - you throw them in a back drawer, hoping one day to be skinny enough to wear those underwear.   Then one day you are walking around and see the same underwear without the sizing issue.  Unfortunately these underwear cost double what the other underwear cost.  So you wonder if they're worth it - but alas, you no longer have associate any monentary value with the brand.\n\nThat's pretty my review of this game.\n\n*Couldn't get game to work in linux, since it required 64 bit.\n*Couldn't get game to work in windows, game crashed.\n*Game price has fluctuated from $5 to $70 I believe.\n*Expansion for game was released, charging for new content, with a price of 39.99 - on sale for like $13?","August 18, 2015","false","0.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

A throwback to the olden days of Command & Conquer, Planetary Annihilation takes Real-Time Strategy and adds Space Colonisation into the mix. This game seems to have it all, great graphics, a good combat system and a really innovative way of winning, via flinging moons at your opponent. As a wise man once said, "There's no such thing as overkill, just Fire and Reload"\n\nThere are a few issues I have with this game that any potential buyer should consider before purchasing:\n\n1. It's still in Beta - While most of the Alpha-stage bugs have been ironned out; there are still many Beta bugs hidden in the woodwork; so your experiences may vary.\n\n2. AI is a little overpowered - This might not seem like much, but the AI is structured so that if you beat it, the next time you get a harder AI and, while it's nice, it really doesn't have a way to make the AI less difficult again. (You can reduce the AI's resource collecting, but that's not really the same)\n\n3. It's over priced - All's fair in love and war, except the insane price tag. You know what other games cost me this much? Sim City 5 and Red Alert 3. Both of these really weren't worth forking out the cash for it. Neither's this game right now. If you can get it for less, say in a Steam Sale, go for it, it's well worth it.","February 4, 2014","true","18.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

No\nWhat about later? No\n\nWhy? It's unfinished, claiming to be a completed work when we all know this is still a beta. There's missing effects, units, customization and more. Saying that the game is ready to be sold, is rubbish, its not, they just needed another bulk of cash to carry on developing. Read on for more info. Remember all this is just my opinion but it is based on facts that even recently have come to light.\n\n\nIn-depth information.\nGraphics: 3/10\nTo allow for many amounts of units on the screen at once, polygon-count has been shredded, where most units and structures appear extremely square-ish, textures also greatly simplified to a huge extent. It looks really bad. I think i appreciated Supreme Commanders dramatic wars a lot more because of the quality of the image and units. Advantage is, you dont need a mega-computer to run this game smoothly, but i still feel like the quality has been destroyed too far. Many negative points for many effects being completely missing from the game. Remember a planet colliding and blowing up in the trailor? theres no effect for that in the actual game...it's unfinished. Too much, is missing from the game.\n\nSound: 3/10\nThe repeated low quality sounds become very overly repetetive, with all units in the game having nothing to say but a mechinical noise, where only the Fabricators (engineer tank/plane) make any unique noises, and the weapon firing for all units sound effects feel completely impactless, there's no OOMPH! or quality.. The orchestral music isnt so bad, but it is short lived as there is no variation or multiple tracks. EVERY game features the same, SINGLE interchanging track based on wether youre incombat or drinking a beer etc.\n\nGameplay: 2/10\nAfter all the wait and all the multipl intakes of cash Uber Entertainment conned out of us, we got scraps. Where in short, the person who acts the fastest AND wins a Decision based Dice-roll, rather than the smartest and most strategic player is going to be the winner of the game. You cannot speed up and slowdown gameplay (like in Supreme Commander) to allow for real strategy, instead, the winning formulae is to build as much as you can, as fast as you can (mash that mouse button! yeeaah!) of something to Zerg rush your opponent in all games. The entire match is a Rock-Paper-Scissors game, with no strategy whatsoever than 'Send units directly to enemy'. The ability to smash moons and planets together is currently very flawed, where even some games end with EVERYONE losing, because early in the game, your planet 'naturally' (not caused by players) smashes with another one before ANYBODY including hard AI has a chance to leave the planet...meaning the entire game was a pointless waste of time right from the beginning.\nWith Land > Sea > Air > Orbital >Artillery > Nukes > Forced Planetary destruction giving too many things to possibly build to defend against all of them, the whole games boils down to who plays the fastest from the beginning, and what choice or units you build at the beginning, in a Rock-Paper-Scissors-Stapler-Pencil-Rubber-Glue-EverybodyLoses style gameplay.\nIn short, it feels pointless to play a game where you know who's won in the first 5 minutes. THERES NO STRATEGY HERE WHATSOEVER, it's all about mashing the mouse button.\nTerrible.\n\nOverall: 3/10\nThe idea of what this game can become, is fantastic, but it is greatly undermined by being unfinished, unbalanced, and not anywhere near ready for consumption, and currently not worth that asking price. My advice is to play Supreme Commander - Forged Alliance against AiX (super hard cheating AI) if you want 'actual' large scale war that involves STRATEGY in order to overcome a tough challenge. It breaks my heart as a massive fan and lover of the other 2 games to say it :( I do not see how this game deserves to be called a strategy game in it's current state, its more like a RealTimeButtonMashZerg game than a RealTimeStrategy. AVOID.\n\nFeedback?\n1. Give people the option like in Supreme Commander to SpeedUp and SlowDown gametime. We all have different physical playing speeds and bodily/mental fingerclickin limitations. It's not skill or strategy (i cannot state that enough), Planetary Annihilation is just speedclicking in it's current state. Its like giving a button-masher the championship-title in a Street Fighter tournament, it just aint how it goes. Wars are won with Strategy, and formulaic Strategies are made by THINKING, not by HOW FAST i can tell a small group of weak tanks in the first 5 minutes to go destroy 3 commanders like they are paper against water.\n\n2. Scale. Planets, are so small that it takes away the ability to create strategies on the ground level, aswell as cause Camera annoyance spinning it all over the place more times than should be needed.\n\n3. Defenses. Most turrets are pointless, they cannot stop much, and are too squishy. The most concerning defensive structure you gave us...is the wall...It is too easy to shoot around and many air units, orbital units and launchers and artillery and (long list of other things) simply ignore Walls. Remove these pointless walls that dont do anything, and replace them with Shield technologies. Bring back limited shields.\n\n---VERY IMPORTANT UPDATE - 2014 OCTOBER---\nIt has been announced that Uber are teaming up with the creators of Super Monday Night Combat (another piece of unfinished junk) to create another strategy game, when this game isnt finished by a huuuge mile.\n\nAt this point i can sadly say that this is all just a money scam at this point, to rush out a crappy game, using kickstarter even though they already have the money because they will use all methods to get more undeserved money from the people. This is just greed, and full corruption even below EA standards. THIS COMPANY IS SCAMMING YOU , AVOID ALL GAMES.\n\nUber Entertainment have gone very low into corruption.This game is nowhere near finished, and we the people are now being stabbed in the back after supporting their game with an unfinished product, and being shaked for more money on a new kickstarter for another game when they already have the money they robbed from you the fans.\n\nThere has been a great deal of drama over the internet on this, and i (once a hugely loyal fan) am saddened to have to agree...All trust has been lost, take my advice and do not do any further business with these swindlers. DO NOT FEED THEM MONEY ON KICKSTARTER. Its a scam, they already have taken tonnes of YOUR cash to be able to afford development of the next game. They want cash, for nothing.\n\nDiscluding the crappy campaign mode which only consisted of copy/paste skirmishes, this is what Uber Entertainment have done:\n\n-Stolen over $1.1 Million in Kickstarter Fraud.\n-Stolen (by leaked rumours) around $12 million from Steam/Game fans in sales of a broken & unfinished game that does not meet the Kickstarter declarations.\n-Abandoned the game to a small team to do patchwork, breaking their Kickstarter contracts.\n-Instead of using the stolen cash to develop the new game 'Human Resources' , setup another Kickstarter so YOU have to pay for it.\n\nExpect further fraud and broken contracts. This is large scale fraud that deserves headlines in every game magazine (where the hell are you guys...you call yourselves journalists?)\n\nUber Entertainment should be Boycotted.","October 9, 2014","false","5.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The controls are very straightforward and if you do go into multiplayer you're not going to get wrecked immediately like you would in similar games such as Starcraft.","June 24, 2014","true","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you're one into instensive actionful matches; you never fully know want your opponent is up to keeping the game full of surprises and suspenseful even during those longer matches. If you're not one for multi-planet matches, playing on a single planet is just as fun all the way through.

I think it's a great game, and it runs great on my ASUS ROG laptop, not to mention my far superior desktop.\n\nThe developers are working hard to fix things and keep in mind that this is a never before seen scale for an RTS game. It's all brand new territory for developers, and from the looks of it they are doing a pretty awesome job with it.\n\nInstead of bashing the game, help support it to keep it alive and growing. Sure there are still some issues for some people but that doesn't mean we should dislike the game entirely. I'm a veteran player coming from the origins of Total Annihilation and the Supreme Commander series, and I've always thoroughly enjoyed seeing the development and growth of these games. Keep the support alive so that the company doesn't collapse like Cavedog and Gas Powered Games did.\n\nGive the game its time and the developers will get around to fixing it I'm sure.

I played Total Annihilation, Supreme Commander, SupCom FA and SupCom 2. This game outdoes all of its predecessors in terms of size and content.\n\nOk, flowery crap aside this is one hell of a game. Planet Smashing, Space Lasers, interplanetary travel, nukes, armies of hundreds of units, and a ui that makes managing mulitiple planets worth of units bearable. There is a good multiplayer community out there so you can have a real challenge after the AI stops being hard. Games can last from twenty minutes to several hours if you let your enemies get entrenched. And if you just can't get a player off that planet of theirs... Just blow it the **** up!\n\nAs for price... It's actually very reasonable for what it offers, which is a gaming experience taht doesn't get old after five ten or even a hundred matches. at $30 it won't break the bank (plus I've seen it on sale for as low as $8)\n\nThe game has a few bugs but the devs are real nice about fixing them quickly, it's never been a major issue for me. a warning though, this game is cpu intensive. Don't play large games if your computer isn't beefy. On the bright side you can still play smaller matches with a mediocre computer. UI does a wonderful job of keeping everything available and uncluttered; its also very low profile and wont get in your way while focusing on the explosions :P.\n\n99/10 would recommend.","January 14, 2015","true","5.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It was in my wish list from the first day I saw the 'trailer' but it was to expensive (84€ I think). When I saw the price was lower (20 € more or less), i bought it. In 20 minutes I regret it.\n\nThe game is not like an Age of Empires (they try to sell the game like a futuristic AoE or a similar game) where you can conquest different planets, you conquer one per one (not showed in the 'trailer') and the improvements or the builds that you have made in a planet, are useless for other planet, I mean in a game you play different isolated games. It is so basic with 5 kind of vehicles, 4 bots and 3 planes... so I do not understand WHY IT IS SO SLOW. I have 'played' 6 hours and 3 of this 6 hours i have been waiting. My PC is average, but Arma 3 in HD runs faster than this game. I hope the fix it because I am not going to play anymore until the game runs faster.\n\nOther things:\n-There are games that requires a short explanation like you have to 'download' different data (in the game, not extra data) to build all the buildings, and not the seedy Youtube video that you call Tutorial.\n- You are waiting for 20 minutes to play a solo game and when you can move you commander, the enemy have build all the buildings, have 300 troops and have read all the Shakespeare books... In the lowest difficult! I will not learn to play if I have to wait 20 minutes to play 4 minutes.\n\nIn conclusion: 20€ burned... At least I have not bought it when its cost was 84€.

Nothing more. The game is still fairly bug plagued, isn't very well optimized on some platforms, and is just generally more meh.\n\nHowever, it has two things that will never cease to be amazing every time, and that's the title of the game, you guessed it, Planetary Annihilation. It's satisfying as hell to do, no matter how many times, and that art-style. For being "cartoonish" it's extremely well created and a nice breath of air from all that dark ♥♥♥♥ we apparently need in games nowadays.\n\nSome of the things I hate so much about this is the same problem SC had with it's AI. As an example, on a two planet system where you're situated on one and the AI on the other, this is the problem i have here, they NEVER move from their base unless it's all destroyed, making focused fire like nukes the easiest way to win every time. They also decide that "I wanna spam one orbital unit all the time because they totally can't destroy it in half a second with one plane!". This makes Galactic War quite tedious when it actually decides to work.\n\nThis is not to say MP is boring though: it's fast, intense, and definetely the strong point of the game, but I can't help but to ask myself, is PA really that much better than SC - FA or 2 for that matter? I mean yeah, PA has orbital units, but that's about it, it's not polished in any way like the others are, it's no way near as intricate, ten times more glitchy, and generally just not as much fun.\n\n\nTL:DR\nIf you want Supreme Commander with orbital, sure, this is great, but if you don't feel like it's necessary, pick up SC - FA or 2 (1 as well for that matter) for a great price and play the living ♥♥♥♥ out of them!\n\n\n\n\n","December 29, 2014","false","79.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Its really annoying when these kinds of games don't have an on-screen way to access the menu, its like RTS 101. My initial impressions are that this game is designed to induce frustration. Its really fun until you realize your bassically fodder for an AI that can multitask, well, like an AI. Good luck ever doing anything, especially using any kind of air units. I couldn't even understand how the radar worked but the second I built an air unit the raids were endless until every one was destroyed. Would have been a lot of fun if the goal was to allow the player to annihilate, rather than be mercilessly annihilated at the hands of a painful interface and unfair mechanics. Hopefully devs wont push multiplayer so hard that they ignore the excellent single player/coop game trying to take hold in the process. I really don't care about twitch or any of that other crap. Also I hate the middle button pan/scroll thing. I have several other buttons on the mouse that would be far better but cannot remap them.\n\nEdit: Found out my esc/menu button was bound to the smooth scroll function, so fyi there, completely able to rebind the menu button accidentally. After installing a training mod via Instant Sandbox, I was able to play around and get the hang of things. Not sure if any cheats were installed but I highly recommend the PA Mentor, Build Power, and Instant Sandbox mods to really help figure things out. The next time I tried the initial campaign fight it was a different story and I successfully annihilated the enemy. It was a feeling no RTS has given me since red alert 2. I really, really hope the rest of the campaign is just as good, if it is this is one awesome game!","May 13, 2015","true","3.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Its really annoying when these kinds of games don't have an on-screen way to access the menu, its like RTS 101. My initial impressions are that this game is designed to induce frustration. Its really fun until you realize your bassically fodder for an AI that can multitask, well, like an AI. Good luck ever doing anything, especially using any kind of air units. I couldn't even understand how the radar worked but the second I built an air unit the raids were endless until every one was destroyed. Would have been a lot of fun if the goal was to allow the player to annihilate, rather than be mercilessly annihilated at the hands of a painful interface and unfair mechanics. Hopefully devs wont push multiplayer so hard that they ignore the excellent single player/coop game trying to take hold in the process. I really don't care about twitch or any of that other crap. Also I hate the middle button pan/scroll thing. I have several other buttons on the mouse that would be far better but cannot remap them.\n\nEdit: Found out my esc/menu button was bound to the smooth scroll function, so fyi there, completely able to rebind the menu button accidentally. After installing a training mod via Instant Sandbox, I was able to play around and get the hang of things. Not sure if any cheats were installed but I highly recommend the PA Mentor, Build Power, and Instant Sandbox mods to really help figure things out. The next time I tried the initial campaign fight it was a different story and I successfully annihilated the enemy. It was a feeling no RTS has given me since red alert 2. I really, really hope the rest of the campaign is just as good, if it is this is one awesome game!","May 13, 2015","true","3.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Using planets to destroy other planets is so satifying as well. Also the variety of units is great. From sea to space it is trully amazing.\n\nThe map creator was also wondeful. it is a bit tough at first when you can master it, you can make truly awesome maps. i have made with this creator a starwars galaxy map, a 'our solar system map' and a map that is a giant urban sprawl.\n\nthere are a few issues with the game. a couple of said issues are that matches with a huge map count lag like crazy, having many AI in the late game starts to lag the map, some connection issues and there are no factions so no unique units. but these problems are minor and probably will be patched/added in future updates.\n\nIn short I highly recommend this game for any stratergy gamer due to all these reasons.","May 13, 2015","true","49.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I played this game a year ago and i played it today, and there was a lot of stuff added! That is great. But the problem is with the optimalization. With just 2 planets and 1 moon, this monster is taking 3 GB of my ram (i have 4GB), and laggin' its ♥♥♥ out with 1-25 FPS on lowest settings, with GTX 650 Ti\nI understand developers, you got some beast pc's there but please put some time in optimalization! PLEASE!\nBut i have no problem with that, it is not that much of a bad thing, but this will give a lot of people no way to play this game at all.\nI still really enjoyed playing this game, even with the fact that i HATE strategic games, but this one is just great! I dont really think some of the units are balanced in their strenght, but i just love this game!\nList of + and -\n(+- means neutral)\n\n\n+Graphics! They are really original and look gr8 even on low settings\n+Number of ways to attack, and number of units to use\n+System maker("create" your own planets)\n+ARTSTYLE\n+Updates\n+Multiplayer\n+-AI (for me i never really had problems with it, but it is kinda wierd sometimes)\n-Optimalization! Mainly the RAM usage!\n-Skins for money...............reallly?\n\n\nSo, i would give it 8/10 but i really like this game. For me i enjoy this a lot and these cons are no problem for me that much. But i regret buying it for 30 DOLLARS!! F****** 30 DOLLARS! Now it doesent cost that much but it is visible devs want to make as much money from it as it is possible.\n\n\nI actually reccomend this game even if you are not really into strategic games, but you have to have at least 6+ GB of RAM :-)\n\nThanks for reading this, i hope you agree with me!\n\n\nEDIT : I can get 1 planet and 2 moons and i am ok with my 4gb of ram, and optimalization is actually not as bad as i trought, but it takes too much RAM\nAlso, on best settings 30+ Fps on my poor GPU :-)","February 28, 2015","true","45.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

If you are into Commander or real time strategy I would say buy, but buyer beware there is a lot going on at once and it is hard to control everything going on in the battlefield.  The AI isn't the strongest on lower difficulties and mainly just gives you trouble on their homeworld.  I never got deep into the game as I like turn based strategy, but definitely a good pick-up I'll have to play more anyone who is into space strategy would love this.  6/10 overall since when I bought it, for the genre I would say 8/10.  I wish the combat and management system where slightly easier to control so I didn't have to do so many damn mouse clicks, but the combat and winning is fast so it is fun for a quick play.  Definitely recommend to anyone who's a casual gamer or someone more serious if you are into conquering games.","March 9, 2015","true","1.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I bought this game when it was on sale for $5, now. Not saying that this game is so bad that it has to go on sale for 84% off, it is a very good game but for what price you buy it for is your choice. I bought the game twice, once for a friend and once for me and I must say it is a blast, I have barely played any RTS games and he's played a few but we went into the game looking at no videos, no tutorials, nothing. We went in knowing nothing about the game and had a blast, we learned as we went and after a couple games of nonsense it became full scale planetary war between the both of us making it very tense and difficult. The battle of 4 armies is amazing since to win you must develope defence against orbital, naval, land, and air troops otherwise you will greatly get destroyed.\n\n\nDefence:\nTo play this game you need to be somewhat well versed with RTS games and if you aren't it'll be a bit before you get good at it. The game offers 5 types of troops that you can use but 4 versions of them. The 4 versions are the basic orbital, naval, land, and air while the types of troops include orbital, bots, vehicles, planes, and naval troops. When making a base you have to build AA turrets, AN turrets, AO turrets, ect. If you skip one of any of the defences the enemy could have scouted you out with a satellite or scout planes and could easily exploit that weakness for the win.\n\n\nOffence:\nA good offence is always a good defence. This game can NOT be won if you just sit around making an indestructable base because no matter what you will always have one weakness and if you dont then the enemy will constantly hack at your defences until they cave in. To win you MUST go on the offence, you have to create an army before your enemy does and start attacking immediately. Scout their base, find their weakness, exploit it. Be unlike me, I feel bad when I do this so I lose many of my games, I am slowly learning to stop doing this. You must attack to be victorious. There are many strategies, build and use a teleporter, use unit cannons, or just make a base on THEIR planet!\n\n\nPlanets:\nThe planets are very diverse and randomly generated. You will never play on the same map even if you choose the same system to play on. There are planets that are like Earth with trees and oceans, there's lava planets full of oceans filled with lava instead of water, ice planets covered in..... well..... ice!, there's the "Metal Planet" A.K.A death star, and not to leave out the gold mine called a gas planet. There are so many planets to go on and many ways to defend and offend on them.\n\nPros:\n- Many things to build\n- Progressive building\n- Control of multiple planets\n- Difficult economy\n- Nice effects\n- Simplistic graphics\n- Fog of War\n\nCons:\n- Slightly unbalanced gameplay\n- Poorly optimized\n- Large amounts of lag when armies begin to grow\n- Horrible bugs","January 24, 2015","true","76.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I put off playing this game for a long time due to crashes and various headaches which stem from Early Access.  Having finally put in enough time to play through two galactic wars, unlock several commander types, and design a solar system, I feel it's time to recommend this game to other strategy game enthusiasts.  That said, it has major flaws which may bother you.\n\nVarious buildings are unbalanced or unintuitive.  Flying bots are the superior builds because you simply build things faster.  You move to the next metal node faster and can get more metal and energy generators earlier than with any other bot type.  You'll get the teleporters early in the game, and I still can't figure out how to get them working.  The funny thing is you would think teleporters would be the ultimate technology, the final tech on the tech tree.  Well, they're really not hard to come by, and there is not a tech tree, anyway.  Each faction gets starting tech and finds more tech as it explores worlds in galactic war mode, similar to a loot system from a RPG except there are no level requirements and it's all randomly generated.\n\nOverall, I like the game.  It was well worth the few dollars I spent on it, anyway.  It's getting cheaper, and it's just an enjoyable resource-gathering strategy experience.  Sure, it's a little on the easy side and overly simplifies a lot of the resource-gathering aspects, but it still offers an interesting gameplay mechanic here and there.  I enjoy shooting my bots from planet to planet, invading other bots' territories.  The Omnicron-style planet destruction is cool, too!  The visuals are amazing, and the game is very well optimized.","March 24","true","17.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","3"

If you've played Total Annihilation or Supreme Commander you already have a feel for this game but there's two huge differences!  There are no unit caps and you are battleing it out in a living solar system. The worlds not flat and you can travel through space in minutes to reach a brand new and perhaps uninhabited planet to extort.  The other main points of this game are massive scale macro and micro management of units and buildings. Artilery, aircraft, naval fleets, and various ground forcers all create the basic combat groups.  Late game units go beyond those even and add in satellite combat in the upper atmospheres of planets or even strapping some giant engines onto a nearby planet and making a very nice planet destroying machine! =]  A few things to note though, this is extrememly resource intensive game (hardware wise) and is intended for next generation computing.

Really, 80% off is pretty good, and I've been looking for an agreeable RTS for a while, so it's probably worth a try.\n\nNB: Please note that you have to make an account for this in order to play, although it will automatically log you in from steam once your account is linked","May 13, 2015","true","1.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's lifeless and boring.\n\nUnfortunately, this game, though pretty enjoyable has very low replay value for me as an individual coming from TA, SU, and FA. I've played it maybe 6 times and probably won't go back.\n\nI can honestly say that this feels unfinished and is currently the biggest entertainment disappointment that I have experienced thus far.\n\nI still recommend the game at the current sale price as it is very fun for a short time and may be great for new players.

It does not have all the features of other AAA games in this genre but with the steam sale, this game is more than worth the 5 bucks it cost.  Being new to the game I might just not know how to do everything but I felt the following was missing:\n\n- No way to queue your build orders.  You start with a commander who builds things and walks very slow.  Later you can build other builders and get around this but I found it odd I could not queue my commander to build three things.  It makes the start of the game a babysitting job where you just follow him from building to building.\n\n- Unit descriptions need some work.  I assumed an orbital defense satellite would shot down a nuke, I was wrong.\n\n- Planets seem to rotate on you for no reason.

There are things that I love, and things that I hate.\nI will also repeatedly compare this game to Supreme Commander, as it's very similar (it is a spiritual successor).\n\nWhat I Love:\nRuns beautifully\nGood community\nGreat graphics, UI, mod support.\nHits a sweet-spot of occupation - there's always something to do, but I never feel so overloaded that I can't manage it.\nThere's excellent sets of tools for management, such as the secondary map (which is a beautiful idea).\nFew bugs\nWell done economies. I personally find it a little resource-rich, but it's pretty good.\nExcellent general gameplay - on-planet gameplay is very well done, and battles are always fun and exciting.\n\nCons:\nGame-breaking units. This is the big one. In a good RTS, every strategy should be counterable - there should never be a strategy that has no way of being defeated. This game has too many.\n-> SXX laser platform - there is no defense to them coming in above your commander and getting off a single shot each. I have had countless fun and even games end with an enemy simply bringing them directly above the commander, and there is no good way of preventing it. It's no fun.\n-> Halleys - it's too difficult to counter a planet in motion (nothing can get to it other than teleports, and if they have halleys you probably don't have a teleporter).\n-> Halleys and catalysts are, in my opinion, too cheap. There cost would be better if doubled.\nStoring resources is also a bit too easy. Dividing storage capacity by 4 would help.\n\nOverall, this is a great game, especially for the beginning RTS player who wishes to get into serious RTS. Its economy is padded, meaning production of units is usually easy, but can still offer challenges. It runs like a dream, and is a truly beautiful game from a graphics perspective. Battles are fun and entertaining.\n\nHowever, once you become reasonably good at RTS games I would have to advise Supreme Commander over this game. The economy is a little too padded for competitive gameplay, and there are enough units that can be exploited, especially in late-game, to destroy advanced and many-planet games.\n\nIf you've never played RTS games before, pick it up. You'll enjoy it, and it will teach well many of the skills necessary to play RTSs well. However, if you consider yourself at least moderately experienced an RTS player, I would recommend other games over it, and to be aware of the problems associated with it before a purchase.","June 2, 2015","true","81.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This game has too many.\n-> SXX laser platform - there is no defense to them coming in above your commander and getting off a single shot each. I have had countless fun and even games end with an enemy simply bringing them directly above the commander, and there is no good way of preventing it. It's no fun.\n-> Halleys - it's too difficult to counter a planet in motion (nothing can get to it other than teleports, and if they have halleys you probably don't have a teleporter).\n-> Halleys and catalysts are, in my opinion, too cheap. There cost would be better if doubled.\nStoring resources is also a bit too easy. Dividing storage capacity by 4 would help.\n\nOverall, this is a great game, especially for the beginning RTS player who wishes to get into serious RTS. Its economy is padded, meaning production of units is usually easy, but can still offer challenges. It runs like a dream, and is a truly beautiful game from a graphics perspective. Battles are fun and entertaining.\n\nHowever, once you become reasonably good at RTS games I would have to advise Supreme Commander over this game. The economy is a little too padded for competitive gameplay, and there are enough units that can be exploited, especially in late-game, to destroy advanced and many-planet games.\n\nIf you've never played RTS games before, pick it up. You'll enjoy it, and it will teach well many of the skills necessary to play RTSs well. However, if you consider yourself at least moderately experienced an RTS player, I would recommend other games over it, and to be aware of the problems associated with it before a purchase.","June 2, 2015","true","81.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I have become decent at the game. The gamplay is executed well, The 1v1 ranked works well. The game is prone to crashes on lower end systems though. There are some tactics that cannot be beat though. The Levithian Battleship outranges the long range missle ship and does more damage. The community seems to be accepting of all skill levels. Dont be afraid to join a coustom game. Most of the bad reviews have come from its rocky launch, the "gamma phase" was odd for UBER to do. Uber has done a good job of balancing the units and keeping the servers functional.

It looks like something straight of ♥♥♥♥ing LEGO and pretty much 90% of the projectiles look like my units are shooting ♥♥♥♥ing BB pellets. I have it on the highest settings, so I doubt it can be any better.\n\nThe amount of units is rather limited and progresses by tech tiers similarly to how the first Supreme Commander used to work, but it really feels limited in the amount of units there are and what they do. As far as I know, the only difference between fighting or using different factions is just the colour scheme. Nice.\n\nIt feels like what Supreme Commander's spiritual sequel would've been if the developers had given up 2 hours into development and just wanted to finish it as soon as possible, but even with all the whining fanboys do around Supreme Commander 2 not being an exact copy of the original, I have to say that even with the severely limited amount of maps and single player missions, that game completely ANNIHILATES (get it?) this game in every aspect.\n\nOh and there's skins for 5-10€ each to change how your commander looks, most of which are ♥♥♥♥.\n\nLet's not forget it's so poorly optimized that even running 2 clients of Minecraft and a server with a 300-mod unstable modpack, while playing Dota 2 in the background, slows my gaming computer less than this game with a browser open.\n\nDO NOT BUY.","March 18","false","4.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","9"

Simple resources, massive armies, great defences and awesome superweapons! I like the art style, it works wonders for the scale of the game.  The units make sense and have short, accurate tool-tips.  Tech progression is straightforeward but well done. The AI is fairly cleaver and diverse, it will keep you busy. And the Picture in a Picture tool is actually incredible! Seems like such a small detail, but I cannot get enough of it!  And this is all before I've played matches against friends, or figured out all the keybindings and features.  Extremely playable and fun as of this review during Early Access.\n\nAs an overly brief description, its a game of pumping out units to smash into your opponent's armies/bases with a multi-planet scale.  Red Alert 2 meets Sins of a Solar Empire, along with ROBOTS, to make Planetary Annihilation.\n\nIf you are a fan of Real Time Strategies, you owe it to yourself to get this game. You will not regret it.\n(If you'd like to compare, previous favorite RTSs of mine were Sins of a Solar Empire, Red Alert 2, Age of Empires 2, and CnC Tiberium Sun.  PA already has earned its spot next to those titles for me.)

The "gameplay visualization" video that was uploaded at their\nkickstarter page was really fascinating and a lot promising too. I bought the game 2 months after it's release for 100 USD. Back then there was only one planet that you could play on, as it was at it's earliest stages. The gameplay was quite nice but I prefered to play supreme commander back then as it was almost the same thing but sc was more complete.\n\nAfter  the beta release and the "Planet Smashing" I got really excited but it didn't last for long. After I played some time, I found out that the game was kinda laggy at loading, the interplanetary transportasion was poor and that the game was in need for vizualization and gameplay fixes. But I encouraged my self and I was keep saying myself "It's still in beta".\n\n27/2/2014 , the day the game was dead for me. I was really disappointed with uber. Even though they didn't finish the game in time, they got into gamma... REALLY? GAMMA? It's well known that beta is the last step before the release and beta is a testing version of the game published in a group of people who have usually pre-ordered the game, to get a taste of the game before it's release. But gamma... what's that? Gamma is here for almost 5 months and there are no BIG changes to the game except optimization and fixes. The only good feature that was introduced with gamma was the "multi-planet" that allowed the players to spawn in diferent planets of the system and the begining of the game, something that in my opinion should have been published a lot earlier. Even now there are few elements of the game reminding me the game Planetary Annihilation was supposed to become. Should I also say that after the gamma release (almost) uber announced another game they were being developing while Planetary Annihilation development was far away from "ok".\n\n*This is my opinion, and I believe that only the kickstarters and the early alpha players will agree with.","July 16, 2014","false","71.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"

How am i gonna get them there?\nI spent about an hour building about 500+ spaceships to tow the army to the AI base.\nI get there, and the AI is completely crazy!

You build up an economy to support your military which then goes on the prowl. Meanwhile, their commander may have gone to another planet to hide. Scale!

The "gameplay visualization" video that was uploaded at their\nkickstarter page was really fascinating and a lot promising too. I bought the game 2 months after it's release for 100 USD. Back then there was only one planet that you could play on, as it was at it's earliest stages. The gameplay was quite nice but I prefered to play supreme commander back then as it was almost the same thing but sc was more complete.\n\nAfter  the beta release and the "Planet Smashing" I got really excited but it didn't last for long. After I played some time, I found out that the game was kinda laggy at loading, the interplanetary transportasion was poor and that the game was in need for vizualization and gameplay fixes. But I encouraged my self and I was keep saying myself "It's still in beta".\n\n27/2/2014 , the day the game was dead for me. I was really disappointed with uber. Even though they didn't finish the game in time, they got into gamma... REALLY? GAMMA? It's well known that beta is the last step before the release and beta is a testing version of the game published in a group of people who have usually pre-ordered the game, to get a taste of the game before it's release. But gamma... what's that? Gamma is here for almost 5 months and there are no BIG changes to the game except optimization and fixes. The only good feature that was introduced with gamma was the "multi-planet" that allowed the players to spawn in diferent planets of the system and the begining of the game, something that in my opinion should have been published a lot earlier. Even now there are few elements of the game reminding me the game Planetary Annihilation was supposed to become. Should I also say that after the gamma release (almost) uber announced another game they were being developing while Planetary Annihilation development was far away from "ok".\n\n*This is my opinion, and I believe that only the kickstarters and the early alpha players will agree with.","July 16, 2014","false","71.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"

(I'm talking 200+ here).\nMy first base is completely gone and my second base is looking good. I tell my workers to put electricity and metal miners all over the planet. (The planet is small, so yes, it's possible)\nI build an army that i thought would wreck the AI, and then i realize. How am i gonna get them there?\nI spent about an hour building about 500+ spaceships to tow the army to the AI base.\nI get there, and the AI is completely crazy! It's got about 800+ planes, a few workers and millions of structures. (Everything from defenses to orbital launchers)\nI send in my army, drop them, and then the lag starts. 0-15 fps for about a minute. When the lag stops i realize that i've got like 10 vehicles left. And the worst thing is, the AI never stop building!\nI put army after army in there to hope that they will find a way to kill the AI, and it works! Just when i'm about to send in everything i got, the game crashes.\nGood Game.\n\nIf the game gets updated so that it's funnier and not totally unbeatable, then maybe i'll change my review, but right now, it's not playable or fun.","August 10, 2014","false","27.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","3"

This game, while still a bit rough (Dec. 2013), is a blast to play with friends. The variety of tactics you can pursue is solid, and the scale of the world in which you can play in is great.\n\nThe game is about defeating the enemy commander which is all you spawn with. You build up an economy to support your military which then goes on the prowl. Meanwhile, their commander may have gone to another planet to hide. Scale! If you so choose, you could build a bunch of rockets on an asteroid, and use them to propel the rock into his planet.
