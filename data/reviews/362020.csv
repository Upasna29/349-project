I haven't played through long enough to know whether this will ultimately affect the ending, but it gives me incentive to play again, and make choices to decimate my army to see what happens.\n\nFor those interested in romances, this game has several to offer of both genders.\n\nThe biggest complaint I can give is that I would have liked to see more battle scenarios, and a little more time devoted to the romance interests.  This is just a personal desire to see more such things, and not really a complaint at the dev.\n\nThe only other minor complaint I have is that some of the CG art is a little rough, especially when compared to the game's character sprites.  The dev might have been going for a specific style in the CGs, but it felt a little out of place.\n\nA final sticking point might be the price.  At $24.99 (regular listed price), some people might think this is a little high, especially with no demo.  While I didn't mind paying that much, I can understand others finding it a sticking point.\n\nHowever, if you are curious as to whether this might be something you want, there is a demo up at itch.io\nhttp://aqualuftgames.itch.io/queen-at-arms","February 4","true","3.6"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","27","29","2","3"

It's about war, family, romance, gender identity, politics, and more. How well are all of these things handled? Brilliantly. Each player has a chance to explore them all or bypass most of them entirely. It just depends on your choices. Each main character has a purpose for existing outside of their romance to you, and are highly developed in their personalities and histories. No two are alike. Personally it's a huge plus that the story doesn't revolve around romance and have something to do aside from waiting for you to romance them.\n\nCharacters and story are the most important things to me in a visual novel, and this makes Queen at Arms one of my favorites.\n\nA note about the battles:\n\nRather than have a battle system like many Winter Wolves games or random chance, the battles in Queen at Arms are choice based. Some are even timed. I adore this set up as it allows the user to actually think about what they're doing and try to puzzle out which is the correct course. Some choices are certainly more forgiving than others!\n\nA note about my time playing this VN:\n\nI supported the Kickstarter and got a hold of this VN before it was on Steam. My playtime is largely based on how fast I could click through most of the dialogue to start getting the achievements. Some of it I reread (again and again). One of the romances were completely new to me. Some of the more negative outcomes and endings I hadn't explored yet. This game isn't kidding when it says you it has over ten hours of playtime. (Which I realized mine says I have. Wow! I do have a habit of getting distracted and wandering away for a bit though.)\n\n10/10","February 5","true","11.5"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

While the art work and music isn't great it works and it helps the game overall. There is a good variety in the story here and a decent amount to digest - though for a single playthrough you're looking at about 5 hours or so with other options to go through and see all the other story options there's another 12 hours.\n\nRead the full review here[techraptor.net]","March 20","true","17.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Queen At Arms is a medium-complexity fantasy adventure otome, with optional (but fairly integral) romance.  The art style you can see from the screenshots, but particularly worth noting on a technical level is the original sountrack - I've very rarely had game music a) get stuck in my head or b) get stuck in my head and NOT drive me batshit, but this manages both.\n\nWriting-wise, the pacing is excellent - there is solid use of timed-choice events that lend urgency to battle scenes and other, smaller-scale conflicts.  The major characters (i.e, the romanceable characters + the MC's brother) are almost all wonderfully-written, with clearly-differentiated personalities and voices.  There is some unevenness to the writing quality overall, however; some parts of the game are more polished than others, which makes sense given that it was released in two editions, with quite a bit of new content added in the Deluxe edition.  (The only full character storyline that obviously suffers from this is Head Archer Cesca's.)\n\nWhat really makes QaA stand out to me over other VNs of similar objective quality level is its handling of gender, sexuality, and general identity issues.  The MC is female-bodied masquerading as male-bodied for most of the game, but can explicitly identify as male, female, or neither, and depending on the relationships (romantic and otherwise) they choose to pursue, in many cases has conversations about identity that both manage to reflect very different points of view via the NPCs and always handle the topic with thoughtfulness and nuance.  The romances themselves also are EXTREMELY well-differentiated in terms of "flavor," which is something I see a lot less often in otome games than I'd like to.\n\nAll in all, I wholeheartedly recommend QaA to anyone who enjoys VNs with a lot of meaningful choices involved and highly-divergent potential character paths.  (It's probably not going to convert anyone who doesn't generally like VNs to lovers of the genre unless they've only ever played strongly-railroaded examples, but I don't consider that a negative.)\n\n\n(NB: I've played this game an enormous amount of time off of Steam; please pay no mind to the apparent inexperience in my stats here.)","April 5","true","1.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/potouto/recommended/362020/","potouto","potouto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/potouto/","84 products in account","Since I pretty much cleared the game with Basic Edition, playing this is mostly for CG-collecting and unlocking new contents c: I must say I quite enjoy the writing though it goes a bit slow at first but regardless, it comes across as a great story with interesting choices to make. Sometimes I find it a bit lacking on certain parts of the story but the game does well on its own.\n\nWhile it's not exactly top-tier in term of quality, this is a good example for indie visual novel. It has the right amount of suspense, action and romance combined, giving an enjoyable playthrough. Replayability is also high as the choices are varied, different outcomes, etc. Though I'm not as fond of the new CGs as I was with the old ones, I have grown used to them and find them cute. However, it would be better if there's a CG gallery to show which one did I manage to collect.\n\nWith the deluxe edition, two new romances are added and I must say, I enjoy them both, character and route wise. I adore the cast to bits to be honest, I think it's the selling point here. During the time playing the game, I spend more time thinking about their characteristics and paying attention to their dialogues more than anything. There are rooms for improvements of course, lots of them actually. But in the end, the game was an interesting experience.","February 29","true","2.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Interesting story and setting, alot of reading however with pretty lackluster CGI. But come on, its a VN, they aren't well know for great CGI and combat scenes.\nI consider it worth it, but then again I have to much free time on my hands...so take it as you wish.","February 5","true","2.9"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"
