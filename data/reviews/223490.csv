They are from a version of the game that will not be developed further. The realistic look is gone. Apparently the developer couldn't figure out how to make that work properly and instead of hiring help, he's scrapping it entirely. The local evangelists will tell you it will still be available, but it needs a lot of development to reach a playable state, so that will not happen now.\n\nThe version that is now under development will look sort of like Mario64, see the project's webpage or the developer's twitter for screenshots of that. If that is what you want to like to build your creations in, then by all means get this game (or better yet, wait for it to be updated to an actually playeble state). I was lured in by the false pretenses of the realistic look and the new version is not the game I'd thought I was buying. Therefore, a big thumbs down from me.","March 14, 2015","false","0.7"," 289 of 309 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","289","309","5","3"

This review is starting to read like a diary, and I think its time to pack it in and move on from blockscape.\n\nWhy you ask?\n\nSimply put.. Blockscape is hailed as being the "ultimate block buliding game".  Unfortunately, by the time this game is remotely near playable and feature inclusive, there will be so so SO many other voxel sandbox games out there that are more current and better designed.\n\nWhy continue to wait around for BS when you can literally Sandbox (as a verb) in:\n\nSpace\nMediaveal Times\nPost-apocalytic zombie nightmares\npixelated retro worlds\n2D platform worlds\n3D open worlds\n\nRight now, the only future promise i see in Blockscape that isnt currently being surpassed by other games is its graphical quality... however with the focus moving away from the publicised "smoothworld" to a more blocky algorithym, combined with the extremely slow development time will leave this game dull and visually antiquated by the time it breaks out of alpha.\n\nGoodnight blockscape hoepfuls, and good luck! I'm done holding my breath!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE 01/23/15\nIt's surprising how a few quick words from the developer in the forums can turn an entire community around.  Jens (the developer) has been opening up a bit and discussing with us the silence that has been turning the forums toxic for months.  I think I need to upgrade my review to guardedly-hopeful.  Though we have not yet seen an update, the sudden reappearance of Jens (as well as an acknowledgement and apology) in the forums has defused a lot of the once-tension and given many of us back the hope we had when seeing this amazing program for the first time.\n\nIf we get screenshots or an update in the coming weeks that make the game a bit more playable I'll for sure change my review to "reccomend", but for now I still can't say its worth it if what you're looking for is a polished game.  If you're looking for the ability to get in on the ground floor of an amazing gmae and make suggestions that may influence its design, then things are starting to look much better!\n\n------------------------------\n\nUPDATE 12/25/14\n\nTaking a break from my three children on Christmas to post a few words (see Jens, this ISNT hard)\nJens gave a lackluster post earlier this month about how he "felt he had to" release an update by Christmas.  No promise, and absolutely no excitement in him about it.\nWell it's Christmas (after Christmas in Sweeden actually) and the "Update" we recieved was a picture of a sled on the blockscape main page.\n\nThe little bit of hope I had died today on Christmas.  Thanks Jens.\n\nI'm calling this Vaporware until the dev. proves me wrong\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE: 11/12/14\nJens seems to have a new person doing part time PR on the forums now and has promised us daily updates on the blockscape main page.  I'll give him a point for the attempt to reach out, though those 'daily' updates are starting to grow less frequent, and the last one only served to show us that:\n\nA- Jens does indeed own a set of legos, and\nB- He can build monochrome landscapes with them\n\nNot that I don't appreciate him at least trying, but aside from his afinity for tiny plastic building blocks and a few screenshots of a supposedly revamped lighting system... we're still not getting any real information and certainly no interaction.  This has the oily feeling of abandonware where the dev pops up from time to time with a meaningless update just to prove its still in production. (Castle Story, Spacebase-DF9, etc)\n\nI'm still recommending that people stay away until we see at least one code update (with significant bug fixes and user issues adressed).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nUntil Jens is willing to grace his user base with a post, information, or just any basic interaction.. I have to reccomend that you stay away from this game.  we were promised involvement and community interaction, but if you want to see how well that has played out, just have a look in the forums for this game.  Not one devlog post since Steam EA, no interaction with the community, and not a single update of substance (both in programming or simple comments).\n\nMany of us simply cannot play the game- I'd say at least 30% of us are experiencing memory leaks so severe that the game will crash every time after no more than 5 minutes.  This specific problem has existed since before the steam release, but as of yet Jens has not even acknowledged the issues, let alone given us info on it.\n\nThese communcation problems have begun to turn Jens supporters against him.... every day I watch the rating on Steam go down just a little more due to negative reviews.  I could turn this review into a 3 page rant, but I wont... if you're on the fence about buying this game, please go and read some of the forum posts before you make up your mind!","October 26, 2014","false","22.8"," 528 of 630 people (84%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","84","528","630","15","35"

Absolutely amazing, realistic landscape and the ability to create extremely high detail structures. Why wouldn't I recommend it you ask? because not only has the developer continued to work on the game completely solo (resulting in about 6 months of no updates, he has now also decided to completely change the game from the smooth and realistic perfection that it was, to a fully block-based game that just looks like an uglier version of minecraft. Apparently this is because lego is his passion or some rubbish like that. I guess he must really like his lego if he's prepared to lose the 95% of players who bought the game because of it's realism... oh and then watch his "passion" dissolve into nothing because he set himself up to compete with minecraft.\n\nIf you couldn't tell I (like many others) am rather unhappy about this.

The game has not been updated since july. The developper does seems more or less active since he is still playing the game here on Steam and he was connected in the forum the 23th of december but he barely communicate with the community. We don't know whether the game has been abandoned or not (maybe I'm too optimistic since some have already lost hope).\n\nIf you are interested in building richely detailed buildings and decoration; you can do that with the present game.

And yes the game look just like in the video but don't forget that they were taken in the optimal conditions with a pretty good PC. The problem is that the game take a lot of time to load the map properly and this creates a lot of issues.\n\nI don't regret buying it but I would not recomend it at this moment. You should wait to see wheter the game is updated or not in the near future. This is my main drawback. The game has others issues but it's still in developpement, so it should be expected.

I would still recommend this game, it has a really great platform as a voxel building game. However, terrain generation is headed in a new, blocky direction that I'm not fond of.\n\nOriginal review:\nFrustrating to see so many "not recommended"s because "The developer has abandoned".\n\nVisit the actual blockscape webpage/forums and you'll find out that he's very active. They keep a dev blog and are very active with the community there. ***There haven't been many updates because the dev has been doing a complete engine re-write, which (from the devlog sounds like it's going well)\n\nDo some research before you jump to the conclusion that the developer isn't going to update/isn't working on the game.  This game is early access and nowhere near the finished product. The graphics are absolutely stunning and if you can read that statement and cringe then you need to not pay $20 for a game you know you won't be able to run.\n\nI bought this game in early 2013 and it has come a very very long way. At that point there was nothing but a "creative" mode essentially with a survival mode that only differed by having you obtain the materials before you used them at seemingly random harvest rates.\n\nNow theres much more to the game, even with a well done electrical system. If you buy this and find yourself floundering with the insane amount of build control, visit the official blockscape forums and download some of the maps other players have made for inspiration. The landscapes are so stunning that I often find myself forgetting where I am (irl) and getting lost for hours just exploring the world, and never finding a place that I want to desicrate with my mediocre building skills. (I don't have much time on it on Steam because most of my playing was before this went to Steam).\n\nTLDR: If your computer isn't great, your going to have lag (it's graphically stunning), check the minimum specs before you buy.

It had blocks 1/16th the size of Minecraft and the corners had 45 degree angles, helping to make the game seem less blocky than anything else on the market, even into late 2012/13.  The game had a few glaring issues that held me back from playing, like the inventory system that hasn't changed and isn't at all intuitive--but it was a solid start to a game with HUGE aspirations like sailing with lifelike wind patterns.\n\nBut this is where a fundamental problem came into existence.  The vision for the game was never clearly laid out.  Jens had his vision in mind; and the forums had their own.  So the forums pushed and prodded in various ways and we ended up with the engine that's in the videos on the store page.  It's an amazing engine, and the forums went crazy over debates like whether it's even 'fun' to have life sized mountains.  I mean, if it takes hours of real time to get to the top of a mountain... is that fun?\n\nI was one of the ones pushing for them though.  I'm not sure it was the right choice, not only because I no longer believe it's actually fun; but because somewhere in the mix, Jens lost the game that he was so passionate about in the start.  And this is consildering that there were probably less than 60 people following the game, and only fifteen or so who were even registered on the forums at all.  You can imagine how some of us felt when Jens proposed a Steam release in the spring of 2014.  The forums were split over whether it needed more time before release.  My personal belief being that it needed another year to actualise itself as a game.  A YEAR?  I hear you say?  Yes, this is where I mention two of the biggest concerns I have with Blockscape.\n\nThe game is and always has been developed by one individual, Jens.  This is a HUGE undertaking for one individual and it can take very long periods of time to develop even mundane features.  This has led to the issues that the Steam community are already all too aware of: Slow output of releases.   It seems that weekly blogs and at least a bit of forum interaction is required to thrive in the Steam community.  And yet there are a great number of games released on Steam, where the developer thought they could handle it and it seems they couldn't.  So you see a bit of activity for a few weeks and eventually you never see the developer again.  See 'Sentris' for a great example.\n\nSo now Jens isn't happy with his game, the forums are unhappy that he's completely shut us out and the Steam community, for the most part, have no idea about any of the history behind it all.","December 9, 2014","false","89.8"," 208 of 255 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","208","255","3","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheCrazyZonie/recommended/223490/","TheCrazyZonie","The Crazy Zonie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheCrazyZonie/","74 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n1 May, 2016 - Since Jens is updating the game again and supposedly hes started from the ground up, I thought I would give his game another look.\n\nTL;DR - Like Dark Horse, I still vote "Neigh". Spend your money elsewhere.\n\n- He did fix the juming issues when moving to new areas/chunks.\n- Realistic still renders a lovely world, from a distance. Textures seemed to take a step back when viewed up close.\n- Clipping still a major issue. Now both Blockscape and Realistic modes will also jump the avatar to the next highest cliff/elevation when running into a wall. Falling through cracks still a problem.\n- Tools still cumbersome/unwieldy to use.\n- Load times are better, but only marginally.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW\nLong Story Short: This game isn't ready for primetime, and the Dev doesn't understand the difference between "proof of concept", Alpha, and Beta releases. This game is borderline proof of concept stage, maybe early alpha release. And it's not worth the $20 USD (or your regional equivalent). I am suffering from Buyer's Remorse.\n\nWhat I had hoped was this game would be the answer to the question that Minecraft poses: Can someone make a voxel sandbox game that allows for a realistic world built from unique (non-blocky) shapes. The videos that the Dev has posted on YouTube seem to say this game has the possibility of answering that question. But not in its current state.\n\nPros:\n-The graphics are great. Don't get me wrong, the rendered world looks fabulous, and so does the buildings built in this world.\n-The Dev is on the right track with his User Interface. Reducing the voxel size (to 1/64th of what Mojang uses) and using a pallet and brush approach to paint the voxels onto the world canvas is the right direction. Tools still need work, but this is the right direction.\n-The generated castles (while not really built like castles) are neat structures to explore.\n\nCons:\n-The underlying engine isn't there yet. It needs a lot more work before this title can claim Alpha status, let alone Beta status:\n- Game randomly crashes to desktop.\n- Game randomly throws up "Game Over" screen with no indication something was going wrong or why the game ended.\n- Game randomly hangs. Whole system freezes. Sometimes it recovers if let sit to stew long enough.\n- Game uses too many resources.\n- Game does a basic render and skin on the entire visible spot of the map, and only renders a small section around the player with the shading, skins, and textures. Screen twitches and jumps like a kid on a caffeine binge. Players will have to wait for the map to render the spot they moved to till the system renders the new location. This high definition render bubble is very small.\n- Object collision bugs leads to some rather interesting game play. (Example: Walking down the stairs can lead the player to get stuck between floors, as the system only tests collision on feet and head.)\n-There is very little help available. Players are expected to figure out everything.\n- The only help provided in game is a list of basic controls. (And this is missing a few of the vital controls. Expect key smashing to find the hidden features.)\n- There is very little text for objects in the game that can clue a player into tasks. All of the tabs are blank, and most of the objects have just a name and what resources are required to make them. There is nothing to help players figure out how to use most of the objects.\n- Unless I'm mistaken, there is very little documentation online to help the player along. Even the wiki site for the game seems to be a half abandoned after thought.\n-Most of the user interface menus are half built. Many are missing navigation prompts (Hint: ESC backs out of most, but not all screens.) In-game menus also do not appear to be well formatted.\n-Text in game can be quite small for large resolutions. Font choice doesn't help either.\n-Features are not as far along as the Dev lists on his web site and on the Steam page.\n-The tools are still a bit clunky to use.\n\nAt this point, if you are considering buying this game: Only buy it if you wish to help the developer along and you can catch it on sale for $5 USD. If spending half your play time fighting bugs and reporting them in the boards does not sound fun, same your money and buy Minecraft instead. (It's only $7 USD more, and further along in its development cycle.) The game in its current state would have been good to use as a demo for a KickStarter campaign, but it should never have been released on Steam. I fear his rush to make money off this game will actually discourage people from buying it once it's polished and playable. I doubt many people who play Blockscape can actually recommend it.\n\nI do not wish to discourage the Dev. I can see the general direction he wishes to go with this game, and it is a good one. If this were more polished product that was further long the development path, it could stand to be a challenger to Mojang and Minecraft. I welcome him to contact me about the comments I made here.","August 26, 2014","false","36.5"," 132 of 160 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","132","160","4","2"

I am honestly convinced the developer has stopped support (it's never been updated since I've owned it).  If I had to choose one game in my library to kick myself over, this would be it.  I was desperate to find an in-depth and attractive voxel/building game.  I snagged this up right after seeing the screenshots and trailer.\n\nOptimization for this game is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•-poor in it's current state.  It suffers from constant stuttering and a distinct inability to minimize the window.  Minimizing the window wouldn't be such a big deal if the game had a decent tutorial or any tutorial.  The UI is confusing to learn and clunky once understood.  There is a hunger mechanic (I think), but it diminishes so slowly it makes no difference (Apparently, there are some animals to kill or something.  There's an occasional bird.).  Gathering resources is a pain, especially trees.  And, there seems to be no real incentive to get AI characters as they are buggy and pretty much useless.\n\nI can say this game has a great amount of potential.  And, is an ambitious endeavor.  It has beautiful graphics.  The idea of pre-constructed castles/towers is cool and adds a mystifying element to the world.  Should the developer ever continue this project, it could be an amazing experience.\n\nI just wish it was better.\n\nEDIT:\n\nAfter reading some of the other reviewers, I checked out the developers website.  There is progress being made, but none of it is yet released.  The developer may release a new build before Christmas.  Still, there really should be more frequent updates. I've had this game for months now, and that's too long to wait for an update (Call me fickle/demanding, but I feel like I should be able to see what and where I've invested my money).\n\nUPDATE 01/05/2015:\n\nStill no update...  Seriously?  If this game ever gets updated, I will rewrite my review, but as it stands I feel cheated.\n\nUPDATE 3/20/2016:\n\nSome good news as far as this game is concerned.  The world generation is looking better than ever.  The textures are gorgeous and the general shaping and appearance of the world have become surprisingly organic.  But, the controls, opaque gameplay and poor optimization are still major issues.  Also, it appears the preconstructed castles and towers are a thing of the past.  That's pretty disappointing.  I will update again in about a year.","December 4, 2014","false","2.1"," 145 of 179 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","145","179","2","0"

I will update this review once I play it.\n\nUpdate 1 11/23/15: No Updates, a year and a half later. I mean the developer has been a bit more active.. but that is all that has changed, and even then it has been more recent then something that changed a while ago. People say "lay the dev a break." Sure, I will, once he decides to actually update a game. You see, when you charge MONEY, 20 dollars, for your game (Which may not seem like a lot depending on how wealthy you are) I expect to get my damn money's worth and for the developer to keep his promises that he sold the game to everyone on. This game has a hell of a lot of promise. But again, I am review the current game, not the update that is promised and not the promise this game has, I am reviewing it based on how I played it and how the developer is currently. But hey if I have anything good to say, the music is amazing. That is about it.\n\n"Don't mix Clay with legos"\nThen why did you do it to begin with?\n\nPersonally I got this game back in July 2014 (Thanks Vitamin PAIN for the correction) during the Summer Sale (which seemed to be the death of many EA games, Vox, Blockscape [This Game], and a few others whose names currently escape me). I was EXCITED AS HELL! The huge beautiful world that puts Minecraft's "Mountains" to shame and the ability to build what could be a huge city that actually looks like something feasable in the real world. Now, I didn't have any problems with running the game, and from what I have read I was one of the lucky few. The world the game takes place in is imense. Not counting the non-existant Cave Systems and lack of mobs, the world looks great. The colorful graphics and cartoony textures looks fantastic. After a few hours of playing you realize that this nice world is only the cover of something worse.\n\nI have been aware of this game since 2012. Some people calling it a "Minecraft killer" with what seemed to be an entirally flat world, it was impressive then and still impressive now. Recently he seems to be taking it away. YES YES YES, He has said that "Features will be added to both world types" which is cool I guess, but you also have to take into account that this "Flat world" that he is adding is supposed to, in his words, "Make adding features to the world a breeze" . Common knowledge would lead anyone to realize that "OH HEY, maybe just maybe having two world types for survival may make adding features more of a challenge" which the many defenders of this game seem to not realize.\n\nThe developer is the DEFINITION of inactive, his twitter is filled with screenshots of something that he promised to bring a while back, and others are more what I call "junk tweets" for a dev which includes him talking about the wonders of Driver lineses. I have nothing against those posts but if you intend on people taking your work and game seriously and what them to think you haven't entirally abandoned the game you probaly should post only about the advancements of the game instaed of about your everyday life when you are not, not coding your game that people over the course of 2 years have spent 20 dollars on. People say "he is a one man team so give him a break!" As surprising as it may be Notch, who made Minecraft, was a one man coding team for over a year! (2009-2010) and brought constant updates, yes you could say "Its been over 2 years with constant updates and now he has stopped" but you are missing the fact that this game is FAR from feature filled as Minecraft was at that point and time. Out of the 30 months it took Minecraft to become released in 2011, Blockscape is about at where Minecraft was in September... 2009. This becomes an increasing problem when you realize that about the first year of Minecraft's exsistance was just Notch testing what would and wouldn't work in a voxel survival game (which was in its infancy at the time) but Jens has had that groundwork that Notch has publicly shown everyone over his development so that makes it even less of an excuse for this game to still be this far behind in development, it appears that Jens has bitten off more then he could chew in this case.\n\nSpeaking of biting off more then he could chew, Jens (The developer) said "Don't Mix Clay with legos" talking about the flat world in comparison to the new blocky, shapy world. Ok, if that is your saying of the day (he made a blog post where he said that phrase about 5 times) then why did it take you so long to realize that? Why until now did you think that everything was perfect.\n\nI hope that this game does come back from the grave with a vengence, however I do not have a big feeling with all of the complaints that are active. If he does come back and actually decides to make a game instead of jerking around then I will be happy to make a reivew. However, I find it kind of hard to make a positive review of a game whose biggest feature is "It runs on PCs Sometimes"\n\nOh and a side note don't believe anything the store page tells you, "I Will never abandon this game!"...One year later and still nothing.","March 29, 2015","false","5.2"," 94 of 108 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","94","108","4","5"

Very badly.\n\nI don't know why people rage so hard over this game. It's still everything it ever was. It still looks like the screenshots. The one and only problem is the dev team is one man, so progress is about as slow as you'd expect. People take it so personally and have toddler tantrums. Chill out.\n\nYes it's made zero progress for a very long time, and will probably never make any more progress. Why? Because people stopped buying it, thus funding the development. Why? Because everyone loves to complain and hate, leading to an overflow of negative reviews.\n\nThe haters killed the sales, which made them hate it even more... well done.\n\nIs it a good building game? Yes. Best I've ever played in terms of detail. It's also full of game breaking bugs. You can build some amazing things, if the game doesn't crash on you. There are ways to avoid it, like don't place blocks down too quickly, but yes, sooner or later you'll suddenly be looking at the desktop. And no, you haven't saved it for hours, so goodbye to all the progress you made today.\n\nThat happend to me several times. After the 3rd or 4th crash I walked away. Awesome game, progress destroying crashes.\n\nWorks 99% better than Landmark. 99% worse than Minecraft.\n\nIf the game never crashed, it'd be amazing. But it crashes. All the time.\n\nThe only big remaining problem is the world generation. The biomes are tiny and consist mostly of snowy mountains and barren rock/dirt areas, and tiny little patches of green here and there. What you end up with is a patchwork of mostly barren mountainous landscape. The biomes just need to be 100 times bigger, then this game would be the best game ever.\n\nThat's the foundation it needed. From there it would have been onwards and upwards, getting better all the time. But, for whatever reason, it just sat there. People got angry and now think it's the work of the devil, and that the dev is a scamer or worse, because people are childish. I'm sure this went a long way in making the developer walk away, as people had decided to rage and hate and join the band wagon of flames because they like being part of the tribe.\n\nThis game is infinitely better than the crazy torch wielding mob would have you believe.\n\nSo what's the bottom line?\n\nIf you want to build buildings in a game with the highest level of detail yet achieved in a game (that I've seen), and don't mind having to remember to save it as often as possible for fear of crashing, then this is the game for you.\n\nThis worked for me for a while. But if you're getting into it and are excited about a new idea you've just had, and you're really keen to try it out to see if it works and looks good... which gets you into it even more because now that you can see it coming together, you're getting more ideas about how it can look even better and !!>>CRASH<<!!..........\n\nYou didn't save any of that did you? You haven't saved in half an hour, have you? You haven't been keeping up with your saves... yeah... that's all gone now.\n\nSometimes that wasn't a big deal. But once or twice, I just lost my masterfully done staircase (or something) that I've been racking my brain over for hours and had finally came up with a design that fits perfectly in the room and looks way better than I was imagining. That hurts. Makes it hard to keep trying.\n\nFix the crashes and this would get a soild thumbs up from me. However, it crashes like a drunken baby attempting to fly a 747 with his/her lips. It's fun on the way down though.","October 23, 2015","false","105.9"," 60 of 72 people (83%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","83","60","72","12","11"

There is the freedom of building really large structures of various materials, endless worlds to explore, you can build gardens and plant trees and other stuff in them...\nBut:\n* Each world you explore is empty apart from the few butterflies that you occasionally run into, bugs that crawl out of anything you mine and swans/fishes that swim through thin air and vanish in the walls.\n* The game crashes to desktop quite often. If you forget to save every few minutes, you can loose all you've built.\n* Optimization suc*s. I have a lower-high-end computer config built for Witcher 3 and still entering  a forest or a plane with lots of grass made the game crash to desktop. I tried setting everything to minimum and playing in low resolutions but it still didn't help.\n* For building you need many units of processed resources (e.g. to build from brick you have to mine stone and craft bricks from it). Crafting 2 units of processed resources like boards or brick takes 1 second, no matter if you craft from your inventory or via a workbench. To build a decent-sized house you need to leave the game running, your character crafting, for 20-30 minutes.\n* The author spears to have abandoned the game\n\n‚Ç¨20 is definitely too much for this game at the current stage of development. If it gets finished it might be playable, but for now, don't bother.\n\n","August 27, 2015","false","14.0"," 58 of 71 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","58","71","0","1"

The developer has made promises of updates, but so far nothing has occurred. The last promised update was to occur before Christmas; but here it is a month later and not only has there been no update, there has been no word from the developer.  Since the last update we have seen pictures of him on holiday with his family, pictures of his building block collection, and promises to roll up his sleeves and get to work - but we have seen no update!\n\nDO NOT BUY BLOCKSCAPE!\n\nThere are only two possibilitiies: This is a case of consumer fraud or it is not. If it isn't, then the developer, who is but one person, has bitten off more than he can chew, and either lacks the financial capital, the skill, or both, to go any further with development.  In either case, purchaeing Blockscape would be a waste of money.\n\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW - October 3, 2014\n\nEven though I've only played Blockscape for 3 hours, that is enough to have experienced all it has to offer.  Blockscape is reminiscent of Minecraft, there is no denying that.  Does that make it a Minecraft clone? No, not yet.  Will it be?  That remains to be seen, but from what I've seen so far, I don't think so.\n\nWhat I like\n\nThe graphics.  It's a very beautiful looking *ahem* game.\n\nThe building.  Blockscape offers many different shapes and sizes of blocks, so it's possible to build some very nice-looking structures.  Likewise, because you can also carve so many different sizes of blocks from the landscape, it is possible to sculpt many nice-looking things.\n\nThe bugs.  The only bugs I've found in Blockscape so far are crawling around on the ground.  The programming seems very solid, and the developer seems to have spent a great deal of time making sure everything works as opposed to simply cramming new content into something that is a buggy, unplayable mess.\n\n\n\nWhat I don't like\n\nWell.... it would be unfair to list what I don't like here because what I don't like actually falls into the next category...\n\n\nWhat I would like to see\n\nMore options.\nKey binding.  I'm left handed, and I can't stand using WASD.\nVolume control.  The music is loud enough to drown out my friends on TeamSpeak.\nMouse sensitivity. I would like to turn this down. My mouse jumps all over the place.\nIntuitive UI.  I spent much of my 3 hours poking around the keyboard just to see what was what.\n\nVerdict\n\nAt the moment, this is a game that I would play merely as a casual game.  Something I can go to when I've got a few minutes to kill at a time, not something I would devote hours of game time to.  If you can pick it up for $5, go for it, but I cannot recommend it at $19.99 at this time.","October 2, 2014","false","5.9"," 83 of 114 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","83","114","0","2"

The game designer says that he has scrapped the current design of the game so as others have said, do not look at the store ad and think that this is what the game is going to be IF it is ever finished.\n\nAs of the posting of my review, updates to the game have just been talk, Other games of the same type are updated, often some of them weekly, and until this game and shows some progress with some Acutall updates and not just a promise that an update might be coming someday, I do not suggest that anyone buy this game.

Okay, I'll give a list why you should not buy this game.\n\n1. This is a Minecraft clone.\n2. You can't change graphics, so you always have to deal with these horrible pixelized graphics.\n3. It hasen't been updated in forever. (Almost like another game: Cube World)\n4. This game is really boring in both modes.\n5. Even with a good computer, this game always has a horrible frame rate. Mostly below 30 fps.\n6. There are no settings to change controls, so you keep pressing weird button placements and looking like an idiot.\n7. Complete waste of money.\n8. The chunk loading is horrible. Sometimes you have a normal lush landscape, and then you just have out of place chunks that have a completely different landscape. I'm not talking about the biome borders, the chunks actually just load over eachother, and this mostly happens when loading a world inside another world.\n9. THE GLITCHES. OH THE GLITCHES. The inventory can sometimes screw up and not let you choose anything, and sometimes you can even make the game crash just from grabbing an item from the creative inventory. I call the mode "creative" because the normal name is just stupid.\n10. I forgot what I was going to put in ten. Damn amnesia.\n\nSo, those are all the reasons I have why you shouldn't buy this game.

The game is too broken to really enjoy at this stage more than just walking around and building a very small amount of stuff, but even walking tends to overload this game it just cant keep up. This wouldn't be a problem if i knew this game was being worked on but honestly its been almost a year since it came on steam and there has been no updates except a few pictures that actually show a downgrade in the quality of this game. If the game would have looked like the blocky pictures being shown now i never would have purchased it. As it is i really regret spending money on this game.

Right now it isn't so much a game as it is a sculpture/map editor, with alot of map no-clipping. My most major complaint is that this game is $20. I personally think the game should have been in development a little longer before having it exposed to the public, and that the controls need to be better labeled. I found randomly pressing buttons on the keyboard gave me more information on how the game works than the 'help' option did. I see the potential, but I'm not sure if this title will make good on its promises. It has a good world generator it seems, with some ruins and trees to find.

So far, all you do is basically go around and collect resources and make items.  There doesn't seem much point in game at all.  It's a survivor-type game, but it's pretty hard to die.  I've only found you die from drowning and falling, though you might also die from starving (not sure yet).  Speaking of death, food is hard to come by, which keeps you alive and lets your NPC work for you.  I have an NPC, but they never did anything that I could tell (even before they were hungry), but I'm sure that is just my fault.  The game crashes a lot and has a lot of glitches.  It would be nice if they posted updates more often.  They need to add a compass, altimeter, GPS, minimap, an overall map and resource map (or be able to make notes on map).  I was mining in search of gold and went really deep and got disorientated and dug for hours without finding my way out (had to cheat and use code to teleport out).  They need to make game more interesting, add more content, more types of resources and different requirements to obtain them (leveling).  It would be nice to see physics work...  a bit wierd to cut a tree in half and have the top half still standing (same with rocks staying in midair), though I understand this would probably be too difficult to implement.  Hostile mobs have been mentioned as an update as well as trading with NPCs.  That would help a lot, but honestly they need to do a lot more.  I see a lot of potential in this game, but it's too boring and needs a ton of work currently.  I feel it's overpriced a lot.  I recently bought Lantern Forge for $10 and it's a fairly similar game, but I find it much more enjoyable, though it too gets boring after a bit.  I personally think Blockscape would be stretching it to charge $10 for this game (in present state).  I think the game looks good, but I would much rather play a game that is enjoyable as to one that looks good.  Hopefully, they'll make it more enjoyable soon.","August 7, 2014","false","41.9"," 36 of 58 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","36","58","0","1"

As I write this, Blockscape is a great piece of software for building fantastic structures and terrorforming. It has two different worlds in which to build. A realistic landscape reminiscent of something one might see in a Maxfield Parrish painting, or what might come to mind when reading The Lord of the Rings, at least when I read it, anyway. The other is a more surrealistic, albeit blockier, version with waterfalls and small streams and rivers. It is a bit "minecrafty" on first inspection, but this is more than just stacking big ugly blocks together. There are three different sizes of most blocks which come in several different shapes from ramps, corners and squares, to cylinders, triangles and spheres with a few more in between. There are many nice textures to use including several types of wood, metal, stone, glass and even lights. Blocks can be rotated, flipped &c based upon their position relative to the direction one is facing. They really seem to know what you want to do with them. Not always, but most of the time. If you want some examples of what is possible in the game in terms of creativity, check out some of the screenshots. It is quite amazing what players have built.\nBlockscape also has a "game" mode which is a survival type mode but it is a bit lean at the moment. In all modes, you can get NPC's to spawn by building beds. There is crafting and resource gathering. I have not played it so I can not really say too much about it. That is being worked on, though and needs fleshed out. In time it will become more involved. One of the few complaints I have is the relative emptiness of the world. There is a good soundtrack (which could use a bit of variety, true but if fits with the game), swans and fish. Hostile mobs are one the way. But yes, it does feel a bit lonely at times.\n\nBlockscape has many negative reviews presently, most citing the lack of updates, the game being abandoned or a scam. And yes, it was a hell of a long time without updates while the new world generator was being completed and Jens, the sole dev on the project likes to  to keep to himself when working, although he did keep us posted about major developments and shared screenshots of the progress. But I can relate. I work alone too and interruptions knock me off the step but things have changed alot. He communicates regularly on the forum and answers questions when asked. Development has NOT ceased and in fact, I am sure it will increase since the major work is now seemingly complete. Now he can work on fleshing out the survival mode and getting things ticking over nicely. As for those braying that the game was a scam or abandoned ? Enjoy your crow, just watch out for the bones.\n\nIn conclusion, no, Blockscape is not for everyone. If you are looking for the next ARK, 7d2d, H1Z1 ad nauseum then stay clear. But if you want to express yourself creatively in a captivating world, and help support further development, then I would reccomend it.\n\n","February 8","true","66.3"," 32 of 52 people (62%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","62","32","52","6","0"

Over the past two years, the developer has seen all manners of critcisms, some justified, some produced from pent up anger due to a lack of communication over much of 2015.\n\nAs it stands right now, the game you get for your $20 is a sound investment. The gameplay is lacking in most aspects outside of building; however, the building itself is very well done and allows for creative designs with minimal effort. The game looks beautiful; grass blows softly in the wind, and the textures are very well done. The art direction within Blockscape suits the relaxing, laid back nature of the title perfectly, and truly makes it out to be more a work of art than a game in some regards.\n\nThis is only a short review, due to the aforementioned lack of much to talk about. What you see is what you get in the trailer, and if that interests you, then you should be right at home in Blockscape.","May 11","true","5.3"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","16","23","0","3"

My biggest hate for this game is the start game engine is too predicable, I restarted the map at least 30 times today (hoping I would spawn in a green lushous coastal area or a beautiful island), and found that the map biomes looked virtually ideantical each time with little variation - with taundra mountains and large empty castles blotting the landscape (without a trace of life).\n\nLooking at the time taken to develop the game this far and the number of bugs still to date, I dont think $20 is value for money, and it is clear the developer is not skilled enough on their own to complete the game, and I would strongly suggest outside help is resourced to assist completion - as the right skills could make this game top of its league!\n\nThe game concept is a strong one, but I would like to see the game menus streamlined, the inventory and creation tools arn't very easy to use - I would ideally like to see a core base like Minecraft with easy menues and a clear technology structure pathway leading to space, and the integration of ideas from a number of different games to make this game unique. I like the idea of a randomly created planet, resource and economic colony management (i.e like space engineers), I would also like see city builder aspects like from Cities Skylines enshrining colony and empire management like Civ and Planet Explorers.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing how this game develops - I just hope it doesnt turn out into another unfinished early access game on steam.","January 16","true","5.9"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","16","25","3","0"

The game is also being designed with mods and user-made content in mind. You can already save small builds as custom objects and share them with other users - something players took advantage of and actively shared custom-made furniture and other items on the forums.\n\nThat said,\n\nIn its current state it's nothing more than a buggy sandbox.\nThere's no adventures, no survival, no combat, no challenge, and no content. Even the most basic thing - building - is plagued by clunky UI and incredibly tedious building process. Most of the features that you'd expect from a finished game are either very basic or don't exist at all.\nOn top of that, there are visual glitches, performance issues, memory leaks, crashes, and even major bugs that can break your saved games and destroy your builds.\n\nUntrustworthy and unreliable developer.\nAfter releasing the game in Early Access, Jens Blomquist has stopped updating it and reduced communication to almost non-existent with no explanation. All while game's store page listed some blatantly misleading information (including "frequent updates" and "communication") which didn't get corrected until months later. This was by far not the first time the dev didn't keep his word, though it was definitely the worst.\n\nNext update was in development for 16 months and brought only some visual improvements, engine rewrites and a new blockier world (not shown on screenshots), which was met with very mixed feelings.\n\nDespite the numerous issues, Jens doesn't seem to be bothered neither by this state of development, nor by negative reviews, dismissing them simply as complaints about his poor PR skills.\n\nAs of January 2016, Blockscape is finally receiving small but frequent updates, although it's still lacking in every aspect. Gameplay remains non-existent, building & UI remain tedious and clunky, and no sign of this getting addressed anytime soon.\n\nI will keep this review updated when/if the game's state changes for better or worse.","July 6, 2014","false","6.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I'm getting 5-7 FPS on smallest screen size that works, clouds turned off, all settings as low as possible, with occasional bursts of 13 FPS after I hold still a bit. Movement feels like I'm standing on a boat. For example, I struggle to walk up stairs and to actually build anything was nearly impossible. After a few tries I gave up on trying to place stairs to make it easier to enter one of the generated (but gorgeous) structures.  I keep falling off things because I can't steer! Maybe with a serious gaming computer it would be playable. I'll try playing it again after the game is more optimized. For now I wish I hadn't bought it.

It has gone from a very blocky world to having two game modes: Blockscape (blocky) and Realistic (natural/realistically shaped landscape).\n\nThe Blockscape (new) world has a geometric look to it.  You can build stuff on the clouds and this mode has both waterfalls and caves.\n\nThe realistic world features smooth transitions between the blocks.  The clouds are realistic, and you can't build on them.  There are also no waterfalls or caves.\n\nFrom what I've read, the plan for this game is that it will allow you to build settlements that are inhabited by NPCs.  These NPCs will work for you in exchange for food.  Farmers will grow food, miners will mine minerals for you, etc.  In the end, it will be a sort of build-it-yourself city/ nation simulator with blockbuilding and adventuring elements.\n\nThe developer is still developing some of the basic features of this game, and I look forward to seeing how it turns out.\n","February 13","true","1.3"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","0"

If you think oh look at his play time you aint got ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• to say. That's exactly what i want to point out.\n\nOkay, so 2/3 months ago, i downloaded this game. I saw it in a youtube video, it looked amazing! And i still think, that it looks beautiful. But then... I started with playing survival. Well that was the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•iest experience i've ever had. 9/10 times you glitch trough the ground which basically makes you unable to walk anymore. Also, 9/10 times you're unable to collect any resources, or do basically anything else. So that's that for survival. Now, there is one point in this game which i like. A little light in the dark, to say it like that.\n\nBasically, you can understand now, survival is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. But man o man, creative. I do like creative!\nWell, flatground creative to be exact. Because for me, that's the only thing actually playable right now. I was really hoping to explore the beautifully rendered landscape in survival, and create some awesome houses so that villagers start living there. But, that was imposssible..\n\nAnyways, right now. I don't reccomend this game. I really, do not reccomend it.\nBut, im sure that in the future.

So let's get to getting on with the impressions:\n\n-=The First Time=-\n\nI can't say this game made a good first impression. I loaded it up and made a new world...immediately i noticed the framerate was absolute horror..roughly 15 or less. So I decided to change the settings which leads to the first mistake: no ingame options to adjust graphical/audio/etc settings.\n\nYou have to set these when you start the game (a window pops up as you click PLAY on steam)...thats where the next mistake comes in: Lack of Quality Options. There's only HIGH and LOW for all the settings but the last one...where it's HIGH and VERY HIGH. As of note, i played on LOW settings for everything...it didnt change much.\n\nThat wasn't all though, I tried to play the game at a lower resolution (which tends to help framerate i've noticed, for me anyways) but when i changed the resolution, the game instafreezes upon loading leaving a black screen. Apparently the game plays only in higher resolutions from what i've found...the lowest i could get it to play was around the 12xx by 720 size. There's also no volume sliders or adjusters i've noticed...which is more or less a SIN in game dev 101. So roughly, a bad first impression...but i finally got to play (in 15 or less fps depending on stuff around me).\n\n\n-=The Game=-\n\nThis is not a certain other sandbox game(s)...this is more focused on BUILDING than surviving. That and theres no actual threats to the player in the game as of this review...at least none that i've found.\n\nGiven i've had very BAD framerate, i cannot say for 100% certainty how fluid and responsive controls are..the only thing i can comment on is the crafting system, the building system and how the game looks.\n\nCrafting: It's simple, but that's once you wrap your head around the interface itself. C opens the Crafting Menu with a split window; Left Side has 4 tabs with different type of things to craft (you dont get any indication of what those tabs hold until you look in them), on the right side is what you can make with what materials in your inventory. So if you have Palm Tree wood and you're looking in the BLOCKS, you can make Palm Planks (shown on the right side of the window). Here's the bad thing about the system: You can craft ONE at a time or you can craft from ALL of that material...the crafting runs on a timer depending on how much crap you have to craft (much like Starforge's system)...there is no inbetween. You can slowly craft one-by-one or dump it all.\nWhile you DO get a TON of materials from beating up a singular tree or rock (which can warrent the Craft All button without worry) the time it takes to craft is unbearable...and it's made worse that you CANT EXIT THE CRAFTING SCREEN WHILE CRAFTING..unless you abort the crafting.\n\nBuilding/Terraforming: This is the shining part of this game to me. Once you understand how the cursor works (it's a 2d Grid that shows how much you're building/breaking space-wise, the size can be adjusted with the mouse wheel from 1 to 4 to 16 squares) it makes terraforming and building easier to figure out. This system makes digging a flat surface into a hill-slope very easy compared to other voxel games (again, Starforge is FRUSTRATING to make a flat, non-wood/metal surface with raw materials like dirt). Making mistakes in your digging is not frustrating as you just aim the cursor grid into the whole, left click with dirt, bam.\nIn a sense it's an alternate version of how you place blocks in --insert certain other popular game here-- and it works great as far as voxel building games go. You just need to stop thinking this is --certain other game--. The downside to this system at current is the grid sometimes glitches and is on "something" close to your face that isnt really there...but is fixed immediately when you swing your fist/tool a bit.\n\nHow it Looks: Also it's high point....and it's low point. High because it looks fantastic on high settings (defualt btw)..low isn't as bad either. The low point comes with the fact that the framerate is utter crap...at least for me. I don't have the best PC ever, but it's good enough to run intense games like Deus Ex: HR, Dishonored or FF14:ARR at near 60FPS. The only time i get 60 on this game is if i look DIRECTLY INTO THE SKY....and ironically that's where i get a glimpse of how eye candy-tastic this game would be had i not suffered framerate issues. It's likely my PC isn't to snuff for this game but it could also be the game isn't optimised or it needs tweaking (specifically in it's graphics settings) to run smoother. I dont know how to work with 3D game engines so all things considered:\nIf you got a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•in' PC, this game shouldn't be an issue as it is NOW.\nIf you dont (like me)...prepare for suffering in this area.\n\n-=Glitches/Bugs=-\nI came across one that crashed the game...it was odd but it occoured when i was looking under a boulder and there was this "blank" purple patch in the ground. I looked at it and the game died on me...i suppose i'll dub this "Looking into the Abyss" and boy did it stare back.\nAside from that, i haven't noticed any other glitches...though i've seen screencaps of people finding some (they're usually related to graphics it seems.)\n\n-=So what do I do?=-\n\nI personally DON'T recommend this game as it stands on 9/23/14...there is great potential i can see in this game, the problem is when it's brought out and if it's existing problems i've encountered are fixed or improved upon. This IS Early Access and it shows...but I want to see this game be its perfected vision, so i'll root for the dev to do his best.\n\nAs with all Early Access games there is no guarentee it will be finished and as the statistics go, there is a high probability you will "waste your money" on a Early Access Game.\n\nBUY THIS: If you want to support the dev and like what you see NOW as far as the game is currently...not what it MIGHT be.\n\nDO NOT BUY: If you don't like these types of games, a poor PC, thinking this is a replacement for a certain other crafting game, WANTING a replacement for said certain other crafting game.\n\nSUGGESTION: Wait until things improve if you're not willing to fork $20 over on what is essentially a gamble (as it is for all early access titles.) It -will- likely cost more as it progresses to the "Complete" stage of life, but if it lives up to it's potential it will be worth it.\nIf you DO want to jump in now, then go for it...just be paitient and try not to be that ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• who sends death threats to developers who take thier time or adjust things in the game itself. If all pans out well, not only did you get the game cheaper than the others, but it would be worth the wait.","September 23, 2014","false","1.5"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

I think it's one of the nicest pieces of software I've seen for a long time. You can build almost anything you can imagine, in real time, with high-resolution textures. I love the freedom and creativity it offers, and I'm very impressed with the results that can be achieved.\n\nThere are, of course, limits. Curves and circles are not really possible, but they can often be convincingly faked. Everything is created on a square grid, with all elements aligned to the grid, so  angles other that 90 degrees are not really possible. Again, there are specially shaped blocks available which allow you to fake the appearance of angles other than 90 degrees. For me, part of the fun is learning to push the limits, and to design good-looking structures within the confines of the game.\n\nThe game currently has two main modes, ‚ÄúJust Build‚Äù, and ‚ÄúPlay the Game‚Äù. Of the two, ‚ÄúJust Build‚Äù is currently the more finished, and more stable. As the name suggests, you just build. You don't need to hunt for resources ‚Äì your inventory is always full. In this mode your character can fly, and can also noclip through solid structures. ‚ÄúJust Build‚Äù can either be used in the normal procedurally generated world of the game, or on an infinite flat grass plain.\n\n‚ÄúPlay the Game‚Äù mode was previously called ‚ÄúSurvival Mode‚Äù, and involves the hunt for resources to make tools, buildings, food, weapons, furniture, and eventually, machines. Friendly Non-Player Characters (NPCs) can already be created, but hostile enemies are expected soon. This mode is very much in development at present, and some interesting things are planned.\n\nThe current build is not without problems, and a couple of irritating bugs may appear. That said, bugs are to be expected at this stage of development. If the game was bug-free and complete, it wouldn't be in early release. In the six months I've been playing the game, the Developer, Jens Blomquist, has shown himself to be a dedicated and reliable guy, communicating well, and producing regular updates and improvements.\n\nIn all, I think this is a great game, and despite the bugs, I really enjoy playing it.

Maybe hire a few more people to finish it as i read there is only one person making this. Briiliant game once completed.

The graphics style changed significantly in this time (from highly realistic to more manageable/gamelike set-level terrain), and many of the poor reviews seem to be due to people not liking this change. On the plus side, this change meant that the dev was more easily able to add features, the latest being a couple of enemy mobs with fairly simple AI.\n\nThe dev is working on this game alone and hasn't always been the best at communicating progress, leading to many fans thinking that he had abandoned it. The updates are irregular both in terms of frequency and content, but the game is defintely not abandoned. If you can make your own fun with an excellent building mechanic and patience is one of your virtues, then I would recommend this game to you in its current state.  The scenery and music are beautiful, and make for a relaxing atmosphere to build or explore.

That's always a plus.\nI give the building a 9.5/10\n\nMUSIC/SCENERY:\n\nThe scenery and music (we'll call it the theme) is beautiful.\nThe new terrain generation is a little wonky sometimes, but the frequent updates are sure to fix it soon.\nThe game feels bigger than Minecraft even though both games are infinite.\nSomething about the huge mountains and canyons and lakes just makes it seem large.\nThe music is beautiful and I never get tired of it. It adds so much to the experience.\nI can only wish for more songs to be added in the future.\nI give the theme a 7.75/10\n\nOVERALL GAMEPLAY:\n\nI've not really gotten into the survival mode of the game that much.\nIt's still in heavy development and build mode is a bit more polished and fun at the moment.\nThe game is definitely replayable, but some of the current bugs might ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up your save or cause frustration.\nI've had a few times where all the blocks in my inventory just turned into white polygons.\nIt can be upsetting when you work on something for awhile and it just corrupts...\nBut the game is still very fun and enjoyable.\nI give the gameplay a 6.5/10\n\nTHE FINAL VERDICT:\n\nIs this game worth buying in early access?\nIs this game worth the current price?\nWill this game be worth it in the future?\nIs the gameplay good?\nIs the building good?\nIs the theme good?\n\nThe answer to all of these questions is yes.\nAs if that wasn't enough to convince you to buy this, check out the community forum (google it).\nThere are "texture packs" of sorts and building "blueprints".\nThe community is amazing and the forum is one of the coolest places to just sit down and talk that I know of.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 8.5/10. It's one of the best sandbox/building games I've ever played.\nI recommend this to anyone, especially Minecraft/Roblox/Blockland fans.","July 9, 2014","true","2.9"," 49 of 100 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","49","100","0","2"

A lot of people are unhappy about the state of the game and missing features that they were no doubt expecting when they bought this game. Which they've quite right to be as this game is far from finished and there is a distinct lack of communication on Steam at least from the developer, and whether this game evolves beyond it's current state remains to be seen.\n\nSo why am I recommending this game then? Well despite the glitches and bugs (my game always starts rendered in 3D which is bizzarely fixed by ctrl alt del out and in again and the texture glitches here and there AAAAAAANNNNDDDD the fact that the interface is fiddly at best. Yes despite all that buried away underneath is a damn good building game!\n\nIf you are after Minecraft with better graphics forget it. That depth of gameplay simply isn't there. However if like me you just like building stuff then stick with it as once you get to grips with it's arkwardness, it is very flexible with what you can do thanks to being able to adjust the size of the blocks you can place.\n\nThe landscapes are endless and look surprisingly good. I have heard that should this game be developed further it will become more blocky like minecraft which would be a real shame. However I have also read that the current asthetic will be retained only not developed further if that makes sense!\n\nSo in short:-\n\nLike just building = worth a punt.\nLike building / survival = not worth your time at present.","August 29, 2015","true","5.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

It is way more playable now, and has many less bugs. Now he is rolling in the updates and progress has started again. So no, it is not abandoned. It looks like 90-95% of the reviews here are outdated when he wasn't releasing updates, but he is now. Thanks for reading.\n\nUPDATE: It seems there are very few people who still have hope for this game. Well, I made a post, and he responded with "You are right. I will never give up Blockscape. Awesome updates are on the way." So just maybe these updates will happen soon. Don't believe me? Click on this: http://forum.blockscape.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=7199\n\nI have to say that this may be the coolest crafting, survival/creative, building, open world game I have ever played. It is a little glitchy though. But not too glitchy to be anywhere near unplayable. It is still very playable and awesome (At least for me). Now, off to the good stuff. The worlds look incredible, the amount of detail you can make is unbelievable, everything is awesome! And the game is still in it's early stages. It is in stage 1 right now, so the main features of the game are building and scenery. BUT, it is going to have things like RPG elements, and other gamemodes like that in stage 2!! Then there will be stage 3. Currently, nothing is known of this mysterious stage 3. But it is sure to be awesome!! So I am very excited to see how this game comes out in the end.\n\nIMPORTANT Side note however, you really do have to have a pretty good computer to run this well.\n\nI end the review with some pros and cons\n\nPROS\n-Great graphics. But be warned, the develepor stated in his blog that he is going to change the overall look of the game. Basically meaning that for all I know, it may turn into a more artistic look rather than a realistic one. BUT he also said there will be an option for the look it has now.\n\n-Building is awesome and fun. There are TONS of shapes and items to build with, and TONS and TONS of materials and textures to use WITH the awesome shapes and items!\n\n-Different sizes. This is one of the best features ever. I don't want to critisize minecraft, but it doesn't have this. And what I'm talking about is that you can make your brush for building blocks...DIFFERENT SIZES!!! There are 3 sizes on a grid like structure. 4 by 4 by 4, 2 by 2 by 2, and 1 by 1 by 1. And so you get an idea of the size, think of the 4 by 4 by 4 as the size of one block in minecraft.\n\n-Current gamemodes. Play The Game mode, which is basically survival mode I believe. And then there's Just Build mode, which is basically creative mode, meaning unlimited building supply, flying and noclipping (Not a noclipping bug, a noclipping option to get around faster lol). Cool right?\n\n-Endless possibilities. Ok, so this really isn't a feature of the game to put in a game's PROS list, but it's true. With all the shapes and materials, there's nothing you can't do!!\n\nCONS\n-A little buggy. To be honest, there are a few bugs. But what can I say, it's in alpha so I can't complain about that.\n\n-Block placing. So I said the building is amazing and everything, but it can be a little tedious.

This is not a review of a finished product, but of the current state of an ongoing project that will soon be changing into an almost completely different game visually. Even then, at this stage, I feel strongely that there are some good realistic looking minecraft clones cropping up around the web that are far more interesting than this, and then there's modded minecraft. The development of this game seems unreliable and fickle, so while there is certainly a game in developement here I couldn't tell you if it's going to be the game that's advertised down the road. You're better off holding onto your $20 until the roadmap for this game gets a little more clear, because there really isn't one right now.","April 1, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The crafting system is a little confusing still and there isn't a lot of stuff to craft yet (an in game tech tree would help a lot).  Also you may find yourself accidentally deleting most of what you build because the interact key and the build key are the same.  One wrong right click and boom there goes your wall or your crafting table. With that said, this game is visually very impressive.   You can dig and build and gather to your hearts content.  I play it.  Should you?  Can you wait while its being developed?  If you have limited funds, buy a finished game instead, otherwise this is worth a look.

The recent Scrrenshots say otherwise however, so my review for this game would have to be summed up as early access Blockscape was a wonderful game, the full version will not be. What sets this game apart from all the other voxel world games is it's realism, it's tapestry of visuals, to ruin that is unjust, it is wrong to change these things.

The game also seems to just be plain and simply under developed, as of right now in my opinion i give the game a 5/10 for effort and semi-original concept. The game in my opinion is also only worth $10 not $20, updates are rare and usually are some time in between.","November 13, 2014","true","2.4"," 13 of 30 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","13","30","0","0"

Yes its similar to minecraft in many ways, but its NOT the same. Try it out, and dont be so quick to judge. This isnt a "Castleminer-Z" or some copy of Minecraft. Hell, look up some reviews of this game on youtube, you'll be surprised on how many people support the fact that this isnt just some minecraft copy. Its aims to be greater, in a more diverse and polished way.\n\nBetter graphics, smooth blocks, tiny blocks, and a whole universe of new ways to build that arnt found in Minecraft. This isnt a " Hype Train" either, its very real. I saw this game on steam for $19.99, decided to take a chance, and now im overwhelmed with how great this game is.\n\nI've played hundreds of hours of minecraft, and only three of Blockscape. From my short time playing this game I can already tell its better. Everytime I play this game I compare things in it to Minecraft, and I always found the Blockscape mechanics to be superior. This game is going to become the "Minecraft Crusher" of sorts, and im looking forward to all the kiddies whine about why minecraft will always be better, as this game will quickly stomp on their little fanboy dreams, and rise to the top.\n\nGet lubed up, because its coming in quick.","July 9, 2014","true","6.4"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","0"

So I forgot about it.\nNow it's come to Steam, and it's changed rather dramatically. The view distance is phenomenal, the rendering is gorgeous eye-candy landcapes, and buildings work. Mountains are a realistic height, lakes and forests and ruins dot the landscape. It's an eye-opening experience wandering through their procedural generation.\n\nCons: It's slow to travel, rendering gets glitchy as you move (I have my settings maxxed, so taxing it a bit), and sometimes parts of trees, or whole forests, seem to fade in-and-out. It's a bit slow building, but probably because the smallest block size is itty bitty so a high level of detail is possible. The people are hideously ugly plastic atomatons. No mobs except bugs. Needs a world-edit type function for creative.\n\nStill needs work, but well worth seeing. You can already build some impressive stuff, and get delicious screenshots.\n\nAnd I haven't even tried multiplayer yet.","October 4, 2014","true","1.9"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","0"

It offers two modes: "survival", and creative. The "survival" mode is tedious and lacking of content (in my opinion). It offers a set of shades and sizes. The materials are up to you to "gather". Gathering of materials is simply tedious, and gets old real quick. The only danger "survival" offers is taking fall damage, and drowning.\nThere are no enemies as of yet, and I doubt it'll get implemented any time soon. The game crashes from time to time, and there's no auto-save.. so you've got to save every now and then.\nThere's a variety of options when you launch the game, but even on maxed out speccs, the textures are pretty dreadful up close. Overall the game looks nice from a distance, it's only up close it looks bad. Good lighting for such an early release, though somewhat annoyingly fast day/night cycles (yeah, the game has day/night cycles..) since you're mostly building and having a hard time seeing where/what you're doing.\n\nThe game isn't bad.. But I've read people saying "It's better than minecraft" etc.. Far from the truth. People are entitled to their own opinion, but this is nowhere near minecraft standard. This is basically the same voxel you've seen in other games(7 days to die), only it's just that.. a voxel builder.\n\nTo conclude, I'm sure the game'll get better with age. I'll keep my eyes on it as it (hopefully) updates. As of yet, I can't really reccomend getting it unless you're really into builders and builders only. no worth the 20‚Ç¨, but I've got nothing against giving hope to a dev in need.

There are od course still some things that need smoothing out in the game but given that its still on early release those things will prob get adressed before full release. I think the realism sets it apart from Mincraft along with having more options of materials and block size to build with. I have 2 concerns though; Firstly, Its been a few months since the games last update and their are definatly still problems to fix so I hope updates will happend again soon; Secondly, I read on the blockscape website that the developer is going to change the game world by making it less realistic and more blocky like Minecraft. I think this is a big mistake since the realism is what i believe a lot of people are attracted to about this game. Minecraft already exists as well as a slew of others just like it. The reason i didn‚Äôt like Minecraft was because of the overly blocking graphics, it‚Äôs just not my thing.

I am really impressed with the graphical fidelity of the game now, it just needs better gameplay mechanics, bug fixes and more content. The game is still alpha , early access, but it is already a fairly solid game and is only going to get better.

People complain about the developer not answering them posting questions in the forums but it's still at the stage where that is only one person, and I guess you should keep that in mind deciding whether to buy it now or not.\n\nIt's currently pretty much all about the build mode, but there's already the possibility of making custom tools to build with, up to the size of 8x8x8M I think, which add a lot to that part of the game.\n\nNPC crafting is also pretty interesting and not something I've seen in other games, currently they build roofs if you lay out a "roof zone" for them and put nice trimmings on doors and windows for you, and you can make them craft blocks. The crafting system seems kind of unbalanced right now in terms of how long things take but I think the idea is that the finished game will involve a kind of strategy element with the NPCs speeding up crafting.. basically, the game is still in really early development but it's very pretty and has some specific things about it which set it apart from similar things.","October 2, 2014","true","67.7"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

Can honestly say if the developer keeps working on it and takes it in the direction its going, it could quite possibly become the best in this field of games. I would love to see dinosaurs added as mobs in survival mode as that would just add another dimension to it.  Definitely worth getting if you like building games as this one is great.

The developer should focus on the fundamentals such as:-\n\n-Performance\n-Control scheme\n-Interface design\n-Help system\n-Configuration\n\nFirst the negatives\n=========================\n\nThe performance is poor, the game takes ages to load and then can intermittently crash on you.  Terrain can pop in and out and sometimes appear in mid air  for no reason, but this is expected during its alpha stage.   The controls are really weird and the interface design is counter intuitive and needs an overall in function and asthetics.  The help system seems non existent and could available not as part of the menu but in game.   It would be advantageous to change the properties of the game to suit different confguarations to improve performance and allow players to suit thier preferences.\n\n\nThe positives\n=========================\n\n-Dynamic terrain and procedural worlds\n-Materials and crafting\n-Limitless terrain\n-Dynamic lighting and shaders for metalic blocks\n-Multisized blocks and varying block features\n-Copy and paste prefabs designs\n-Water and other liquids\n-Its amazingly cool to have a world that looks 10000 better than minecraft.\n\n\nSo support the developer AND BUY IT!!!!!\n\n\n\nIt is early days yet but this game could define the end of sqauky blocky worlds and provide a frontier for realistic and emersive worlds for us to enjoy and play in.\n\n\n\n","July 8, 2014","true","0.4"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

There are loads of blocks to chose from and different colors, textures and uses. Even though the game can be glitchy at times and unrealistic, there are a lot of updates that you usually don't realise and the update notes are displayed on the Blockscape forums. Now, to get to some pros and cons of the game.\n\nPros\n\n*A ton of blocks to chose from\n*Regular updates (the ones that make you wait or the game to load) that mainly fixes minor bugs\n*NPCs\n*Multiplayer (I think)\n*Huge worlds\n*Randomly generatd worlds\n*Two game modes\n*Pre-made structures\n*Different sized blocks\n\nCons\n\n*Random glitches (the game is early access so that is normal)\n*Weird textures for some blocks\n*Creatures that come out of nowhere\n*NPCs spawn at EVERY bed (unless there is a way to stop them spawning and I am stupid)\n\nDon't mind the bad reviews. Jens (the developer) does communicate with the community but he is the only one. Updates are frequent but you might not notice them at first.

This is Minecraft. This is what I initially though.  You and I are almost right.  It's *like* Minecraft.  I emphasize like because Minecraft is fun, it's addictive, it's by all means a good game.  However, Blockscape is much more ambitious then Minecraft.  In the first five minutes, I found something I been finding rare. Exploration.  The procedural generation created an absolutely beautiful landscape.  The creation is much more detailed then what you get in Mincecraft.  I can not wait for two things.  To see the worlds created by people not just precedural generation and rpg.  They are both going to be awesome.  But this never occur if you do not support it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zigzachman/recommended/223490/","zigzachman","ZigZach","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zigzachman/","93 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI first purchased this game about a year ago(before the Steam EA release), and I was very impressed with the visuals and solid gameplay. While the game was, and still is, very basic, it excells at immersing you in its stunningly beautiful environments. If you haven't noticed, this game is amazing to look at, not only compared to other titles in this genre, but compared to most other games as well. While the world still shows signs of its voxel roots it masks them very well with convincing vegetation, and terrain features. The beauty of this game doesn't end with its masking attempts either, with vivid colors, impressive lighting, an epic soundtrack, and an overall natural and magical terrain, you often feel compelled through the world simply to see what's over the next hill, all the while accompanied by an audio track that feels inspiring and exciting.\n\nWhen I saw that Blockscape had released on Steam as an Early Access title I knew I should download again and dive back in to see the changes. I am happy to see that in my time away there have been some significant updates. Right away I notice less crashing than before, which was my largest complaint previously. I also see that a crafting system has started to be implemented, and you now have a sense of a character model, although with how unimpressive it is I'm not sure being a floating head is worse. My framerate is also much steadier than it was before, showing that the developer has put time into optimization.\n\nBugs definitely still exist, and character movement can be wonky at times. Some surfaces will cause your camera to jump rapidly while moving across them, and small steps in a surface can bring you to a hault rather than changing your elevation. Other things you may notice are odd floating boulders(which I'm sure has to do with the algorithms used to generate terrain), but with how otherworldly geologic features appear in this game maybe these floating rocks hint at a more magical side of this world we find ourselves in?\n\nAt this time I do recommend this game, but not to everyone. If you enjoy the pure pleasure of exploring a beautiful new world, and building structures within that world you may find something to love here. Also if you like the idea of watching a game grow from a basic idea to fruition, and you also enjoy the exploration/crafting genre then you may have found a gem in Blockscape. This game is at the point in its life where the foundation is set, with only minor tweaks needed, and features(survival, crafting, empire building etc) have only begun to be added. There is no story, or enemies to encounter, and the wildlife that you see is a placeholder at best, so your time in Blockscape will mostly be spent building and crafting. This is the pivot point for this project, with our further support hopefully it will allow the developer to expand their workforce and really have a chance to push this game to the heights it is capable of.","July 17, 2014","true","2.2"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","7","19","0","0"

The landscapes are wide and idyllic, offering a great exploration and building area, and the game also has no vertical space limitations (z-axis). The combination of those caracteristics and the fact that the game is not restricted only to cubes, like in many other games of the same genre, gives you almost endless building possibilities. The game is very intuitive and straightforward, and many times you only need to learn how to combine different tools and materials.\nIf you ever wanted to build virtual monuments like pyramids, temples and castles that resembles those of real world, then definitely this game is for you!","October 23, 2014","true","55.7"," 9 of 26 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","9","26","0","0"

I would like to say, thats not true. At least, not now. If you follow the Blockscape website and Facebook page, you will get updates every so often of what Jens is working on. Now, as far as the game goes....Its quite good for the current stage its in. It has some very pretty graphics and has pretty good building mechanics aswell, however, they could still be worked upon. But this game is, at least i think, is worth supporting. I dont regret purchasing it :)\n\nEDIT: Again, i have seen even more people say that the dev does not update the community about what he is working on. Although, i can forgive this as it might be hard to find the Devlog for some people. http://www.blockscape.com/v2/devlog/ There is the devlog. He is updating quite frequently on what he is trying to acheve and what he has accomplished. The extremely infrequent updates, are making it seem like no progress is being made on the game. However, i believe that the dev is waiting until he has developed enough content, to then release a decent update for the game. As you can see in the devlog, he is most certainly working on things. My view on the game has not changed as of late :). Oh, i should also mention, it is only one man working on the game.\n\n2nd EDIT: Well, a year on, and the game has gotten no updates. There has been some post made by the dev on the progress of the game, so he is working on it, and has shown some new screenshots of the game and how it looks now. But as of right now, i would NOT by this game. I think its potential is honestly extremely high still, but the future of the game is pretty uncertain at this point.

It's really improving. The developer has been working to fix it.\n\nThis game is generally a really good game.\n\nClearly, the developers are on the right path because the game does pretty well in most perspectives, content, gameplay, graphics, and a bunch more.\n\nThe game has a lot of content to chose from to build with and good gameplay and absolutely beautiful graphics to hook anyone onto it.\n\nAnd this game is voxelbased (obviously), just like minecraft, except the terrain is smooth and much more realistic, but it is still voxel based for a better building environment.\n\nIt is a game I really look forward to what it will become.\n\nHowever, this game is an early access game, and it is a little buggy, but this doesn't mean broken features buggy, heck, I still haven't found anything broken, maybe some features buggy here and there, but not severe at all and the bugs don't really break the game much.\n\nOne of the bugs I experience is some bugs in the physics, such has getting my head stuck in half-bricks/slabs, y'know, little bugs like that.\nBut just give em' a little fix, and it's all better anyways.\n\nBefore I forget, the building system is a little bit complex so at times it gets to the point where building takes forever when building with the tinier bricks (blocks can come in different shapes and sizes), but hopefully the developers will realize that and fix it. But don't let that turn you down about this game. If it does, try and save this game's page and come back and check what progress the devs have made, because remember, this game is early access.\n\nSo to conclude this review, I totally recommend this.\nI give this a 10/10, although I almost gave 9/10 because of the little bugs and the slow building, but the game is very new, and who knows, those issues may change, and the game is looking really good so far.\n\nFinally, I can stop typing.\nHopefully this convinced you to help support the developer in the making of this really awesome game (if you found this game looking for a building game that fits your needs).\n\nEDIT: The reviews saying the developer is done with this game or saying the developer is bad because of the inactivity as far as I can tell are wrong.\nI have just looked at the site, and under "news" the latest post (on 10/1/2014) the developer states that they are not inactive, and he said that a new lighting solution is in the works, and working on coding to handle mods (his english wasn't that good, the developer's native language probably isn't english, so some parts I may have misunderstood, but I hope that means modding, which probably it does.\n\nAlso, for the post, just go to the website from the link above, or here:\nhttp://www.blockscape.com/v2/\n\n\nEDIT 2: When you buy this game, you are supporting the developer in the making of this game, and you are buying an EARLY ACCESS, and the developer can't be blamed for a decision YOU made, of buying  an early access.\nPLEASE, I repeat, PLEASE don't go and ask for a refund or complain the game is "awful" on the forums, otherwise you'll only make yourself look like an idiot.","September 27, 2014","true","43.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite my computer being only 4 years old and running an nvidia geforce 555m graphics card, i7-263QM quad core cpu and 8gb of DDR3 RAM I still found I struggled to get decent frames. I got quite a bit of fps lag and even toggling vsync and low settings didn't help. Game could use some optimising. Hope to see this game turn into something great.\n\n26/2/16 - EDIT: Tried this game again with a computer brand new. Running Quad core i7-4720HQ @ 2.6 to 3.6 GHZ, Nvidia GTX 960m, 16 gb of Ram. Even with the changes in hardware the game chugged for me. Graphics was stuttery although seemed to run about 15fps I couldn't see exactly. This was in a realistic world on high settings. While it may be advantageous to turn the settings down, the game clearly did not and still does not run well for me and so I'm NOT recommending this game anymore. For others it may play well but I had a terrible experience with this game on more than one try.
