I bought this one again after finding out how bad the new one was. You should mod this game for sure though, with larger regions, the NAM and CAM and whatever else you want on the great modding sites for this game.\n\nCurrently im playing on a very detailed  sat. map of the US with over 500 of the largest city tiles in one single region. Just one of my city tiles from what i heard is four times bigger than a city tile on the new version and i have over 500 of them, all are connected to and interact with each other. Building the entire country with things so spread out leaves tons of open land adding to the realism that the region system in this game creates.\n\nHANDS DOWN THE BEST CITY SIM IN THE WORLD AND THIS GAME IS OVER 10 YEARS OLD!!!!!

It's old but it's the best one out there if you ask me. Even though the graphics aren't full 3D they are still surprisingly high definition and it is fun to zoom in close just to look at the buildings. The graphics really do still hold up. I was honestly surprised.\n\nThe gameplay is fantastic if you're into this genre although there are a few problems. Some of those can be fixed with mods, which there are plenty of. There's nothing that would ruin the experience, just some nit-picky things that would make a couple of things easier in the long run. The modding community is great and popular mods are totally worth getting even if some of them change the game mechanics quite a bit. If you new to the genre I would recommend you first play a city or two without mods to get the vanilla experience. For the fans of the genre: mod to your hearts content. You can pull a lot of extra depth out of the game with the right mods.\n\nDepending on how you play once you reach that final stage with your city where everything runs like a finely oiled machine it might feel like you've reached the end. Some may continue to micromanage every little aspect for days to come but I recommend starting a new city. I personally prefer going for a visually impressive city rather than the most efficient one. Sim City becomes more of an information management/puzzle game if you aim for the most productive city. It is more enjoyable to create something visually pleasing.\n\nYou will waste days managing your city once you get sucked in. Prepare your calendar accordingly. This among my favorite games of all time.\n\n(I have probably played SimCity a hundred hours back in the day.

Look no further!\n\nPros\n- Not Sim City 2013\n- Looks very good for a game from 2004\n- Gritty, Realistic, Approach to City Design\n- Large Selection of Terrains\n- Easily Adjustable Settings\n- Amazing Soundtrack\n- Modding Kit makes for a longer game\n\nCons\n- Terrible System Optimization for Newer PCs\n- Borderline Broken Demands on Easy and Medium Difficulties without Mods\n\nI have been playing this game for years, picked it up on Steam last Summer. I have to say, the biggest issue I have with it now is Optimization on my PC. You cannot run the game past 1600x1080 without massive screen tearing and Region View Issues and Terrain Glitches (Purely Cosmetic.) Overall I would say the only other noticable issue, after 10 years (10 year old game better than a game made in 2013, who the ♥♥♥♥ knew?!) is the broken system demands on Easy and Medium. Both difficulties will eventually go in complete negative demand, with no possible way to recover, unless you install mods, which leads to my next point. Even after all these years the modding community is still huge, so much effort goes into so many mods. Honestly I see no reason not to buy this game.\n\n9/10 - Great game if you like City Planning and Building games.","January 31, 2014","true","95.5"," 174 of 185 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","174","185","0","9"

I caved in for the Steam version so I don't need my optical drive installed.\n\nThis game is my all time favorite game, nothing has come close to beating it. This game released more than 10 years ago still holds up very well thanks to the modders and the community of this game. If you don't like something about the game then search Simtropolis for a mod to fix it.\n\nAs a beginner the modding might seem a bit scary. Tons of dependencies! What do I do?!? I started by installing the mods slowly. First the NAM mod which is essential, then other things such as added trees, buildings, etc. You don't need to install every mod at once to have fun in this game. Just be sure you install all the dependencies to the mods your installing, or else you'll get dreaded brown boxes all over your city (no fun!).\n\nIf you need to compare this to modern city builders such as Cities Skylines or Simcity 5 I still think that it beats it. Maybe it's just because I have a great nostalgia about this game. Cities Skylines is an excellent successor to this, but it just can't replace this game in my heart. Compared to Simcity 5, this game is amazing. Bigger cities, doesn't need Origin, and no major "Agent" problems.\n\nWhether you want to build an uber realistic city or just a casual city this game is definitely for you. It goes on sale for $5 during the sales, so if you can wait then I would recommend it. If you want a 3D city builder with easy to install mods Cities Skylines is probably for you.\n\nAlso, before running this game check out the guides on Steam on how to run this on modern hardware. My system only needed some tweaks, but yours might need more. My system specs: AMD FX 6300, 8gb DDR3 RAM, AMD Radeon HD 7870, MSI 970a-g43 AM3+ motherboard.\n\nGet ready to waste hours of your life creating the perfect interchange!\n\nUpdate: Since this review I've upgraded my PC to a i5 4690k, 24gb DDR3 RAM, MSI Gaming 6G GTX 980ti, and MSI Gaming 5 motherboard plus Windows 10 and the game still works great.","April 2, 2015","true","173.8"," 99 of 105 people (94%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","94","99","105","11","0"

The CD is still in my laptop right now. For those that don't know, SimCity is the originator of being a mayor, placing down your roads, zoning area for buildings, watching them grow and balancing the budget. This isn't for everyone, but to a lot of us, this is huge fun and SimCity 4 is probably the best in the series.\n\nThis is all single player, instead of the more current SimCity 2013 that is focused on multi-player. The game can cycle from night to day, but its just a look and doesn't seem to do anything special. You have terrain control like previous versions of SimCity before you start each game.\n\nYou start out in a region map of dozens of land plots. Large, medium and small. You pick a plot of land and make your city. You can then save that city, load the region and start up a new city on a different plot of land or go to a previous city. Why does this matter? Because you can trade between cities, you can export and import water, garbage, energy and so on. Not just that, but the sims / citizens can travel back and forth. Such as living in one town and going to another for work. You'll also have pollution effects that seep into other towns as well. This is all single player, so you need to jump between cities. Because two or more towns can thrive off of one another, you can put your heavy polluting industries in an extremely profitable town on their own with no residents living there to complain about how awful it is. There is no need for police, hospitals or schools if no one is living in your industrial city. Then just make some mass transit system for them to get to and from work.\n\nWhen you play, you have full control from the start with only a few things locked away unlike Cities XL that requires your city to grow before it unlocks things for you. Because you have full control, that may set you up for failure quickly. Highways, big hospitals, deluxe police stations and so on cost big money and until your city is big, you should keep it small. Once your city grows, the game has ways to tell you that your hospital is too small, such as your staff workers will go on strike. How do you know if its too small? Sadly you can't just hold shift and click the building, you need to click the ? and then the building. It seems tedious, but you'll see what the building can handle and adjust its budget. If you can't adjust the budget high enough, its time to make a bigger version of the building or just plop down another building to do the same thing.\n\nYou need to keep your budget balanced, everything will cost monthly money, so you either need to cut spending from places like roads, schools, utilities or raise taxes, which might make some businesses, commerce and residents run to away from your city. When you lower taxes, of course people move in, but then your hospitals, schools and so on will be overcrowded, your buildings will grow larger. Its beautiful.\n\nThe game will tell you what kind of zones you'll need, such as low, medium and high density residential, commercial, industry and even agricultural. Its your job to plop them down. It has a graph to show you if you need more and less. If you need less, raise taxes for them, or replace the zone with a new zone. Luckily the game makes it easy to replace zones.\n\nThere are all sorts of charts and maps, such as pollution, both water and air. Crime, fire safety, land value and so on. If you want to raise land value, put down police, fire, schools and so on. Then add parks and various things to drive value up. Replace dirty industries that pollute with cleaner industries like medium density manufacturing.\n\nYou can also click on zoned buildings to see the crime, water, power, pollutants, and even the driving pattern of where the residents go and where the employees come from. Its a very nice feature. Especially if you're trying to reduce traffic. You have control over roads, avenues, streets, highways, trains, subways, busses and so on. Its fun to see just how far people will ride a bus to work. The game has plenty of charts too, in order to demonstrate how far the average drive is, how much garbage you have, the age and education of your population. Its all a lot of information.\n\nOn top of that, you have advisers that will tell you what's good and bad about your city. The game sadly uses pop up windows to tell you what's up, but thankfully there is a setting to turn it off, or else before you know it, you'll have nothing but popups. Instead you can look at the ticker at the bottom of the screen and even go into the advisers section to see their specific needs.\n\nAfter all is said and done, you can then summon a natural disaster (or truckasaurus) to come and destroy your town. Why you'd want to? Just for the laughs I guess.\n\nBecause this is the deluxe edition, it comes with Rush Hour expansion pack, which gives you the ability to take over vehicles and drive them on the road. Not first person, but still from the normal almost top down perspective. This content gives you missions that will give you cash and other rewards, but really, it doesn't feel like a great addition. Its just there.\n\nThis game is a classic, but after 10+ years, I don't think that its aged very well. After months of playing Tropico and Cities XL, those games just seem to run smoother control wise and have explanation to them. Having a hot key for pause would have been nice. Fires break out in your town extremely frequently, no matter how good your fire coverage is. It just breaks the flow of the game, you need to send your fire fighters out to stop the fire and wait while they put it out. That's just not fun.\n\nThere are also a few minor bugs, but some that will crash the game. Since there is no autosave, you can lose an hour's worth of progress if not an entire city.\n\nIt is still an enjoyable game and I can recommend it more than SimCity 2013. Is it worth the $10 - $20? No and yes. If you enjoy mayoring sims, you can sink days and months into this game, then its worth it, but you should wait for a $5 sale if not cheaper.","June 24, 2014","true","209.4"," 96 of 104 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","96","104","0","0"

It is dated and has some issues such as lack of widescreen support and the other usual issues older games have with newer OS's, but that can be fixed. And despite that, from what I have heard, this game is still better than the recent remake even without all those online issues that game had, with more features and larger maps to build cities on. Also this game has a strong modding community (Simtropolis) with an insane amount of new buildings and stuff to add to your game. Ideally you want a good PC if you plan on making super-big cities and don't want your game to lag like crazy, but even my poo PC can more or less handle this fine despite having built cities more densely populated than any currently existing on Earth.\n\nSo if you feel the sudden urge to build cities, and yet realize that so many city building games of the past few years have a host of glaring issues, then SimCity 4 is your best choice.

Built safe zone city one region slot over. Raised volcano in safe zone city and burned all survivors.\n10/10 would hijack expensive military equipment again\n\nActual review (yes, cities skylines taken into comparison):\n\nThis is the supreme reigning king of city builders. While in time it will likely be beaten by Cities: Skylines, as of now this is still the best in terms of purely easy to use UI, fun things to do (the TL;DR is easily possible ingame), sheer number of mods, and customizability. I have thousands of hours in on the simcity series as a whole and only bought this on steam as another version (I still use disc/GoG versions more). The majority of the hours went into either 3000/unlimited or this version, both pre-and post-rush hour expansion (included in this one).\n\nKeep in mind this is also the HARDEST of the simcity games, and even on easy it is very possible to screw yourself over several hours in with a chronicly failing city that slowly decays into destruction on its' own. It's also one of the most fun, however, as SimCity 3000 did away with the terraforming (mostly) of simcity 2000, and this was the first (of 2) in the series to introduce regional gameplay with multiple cities interacting on a massive map. Big difference between this and the latest simcity, however, is that in addition to preset regions, YOU create them. You can terraform them, modify their size, city layouts/sizes literally using microsoft paint, plop the cities, set up the city interactions, etc. The only thing missing is the multiplayer, but with the city sizes in this being arguably 16 times larger than simcity 2013, that more than makes up for it as you will sink dozens of hours into filling up a map and customizing it the way you want to with what is also the best UI in the series, doing a lot of the work for you and letting you optimize where and when needed.\n\nSo, why would I even recommend this over Cities: Skylines?\n\nAS OF RIGHT NOW. As of the time of this review, Cities: Skylines is a fantastic city builder with a mass modding community and...that's it. There is no regional play, terraforming has to be modded in to be performed mid-game, the art style is VERY bland and probably has less than 100 buildings the game can call upon to place down in zones, the UI when placing roads and such has a lot of issues that make it much harder to use than it should be, there's a lot of missing features that have to be modded in, and the ability to truly customize the city is significantly lower than in this game. While I will continue to play cities skylines, I have the game heavily - and I mean HEAVILY - modded to even begin to replicate the magic of SimCity 4 and its' predecessors. I feel like the game was designed around being better than SimCity 2013 which in some aspects (art, soundtrack, pure...fun things to do, customizability) it isn't, but the major missing things in SimCity 2013 (city sizes, DRM, lack of map editing) were what drew people in. That, and the game expected it so it would have a large modding scene to fix what the developers didn't add. That's understandable, as the dev team is VERY small for Cities Skylines, but the thing is that SimCity 2013 lowered the bar of city builders to a point where Cities: Skylines was no longer just below it, but far above it.\n\nUnderstand this: I WILL continue to play cities skylines. And I believe it is a great game. But it is going to take a monster that can do what Cities Skylines did to fix the SimCity 2013 formula, and also take the time to add in what SimCity does RIGHT, before there will be a city builder capable of dethroning this one. It has to look and play the part, and give the user the ability to have FUN above all with customizability, destruction, and other random things that occur (like piloting a military chopper guns blazing into your own house...like you can in this game).\n\nIf you do NOT own this game and are a fan of city builders, I highly encourage you to get it now. At a price of $20 for the base AND its expansion, the only downside is compatibility with modern OS systems, and it is still possible to make it work with a bit of stuff done. What you're ultimately getting is the definitive city builder, and what remains the king of city builders that many of us fondly remember from our childhoods and will continue to remember. This is a timeless game in ways others simply cannot and likely will not ever live up to.","May 2, 2015","true","30.0"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","91","39","43","14","1"

When I started up the game for the 1st time I saw that I sometimes suffered from unexplainable graphical issues (colored lines ramdomly appearing on the screen). I went on. Then I noticed that the game sometimes chrashes (it happened to me about 10% of the times that I play it). I went on. Then I saw that I had been playing for hours. I went on.\n\nThis game is just so good that I dont't really mind these issues that I have from time to time. It is just so nice to start from scratch and create the city of your dreams (or the City of Death, for that matter). But that's just the start. After you're done with one city you will want to start up another neighboring city and connect both. and then a third city. And a fouth. There is just so much replayability because every city has different terrain. And while I can say that it's definetely not easy to make (and keep) your city healthy , it's not too complex to handle.\n\nSince I bought this I have played more than 140 hours in 5 months time. For someone who also plays numerous other games, that's quite something. So yes, I'd definetely recommend this game if you have only a remote interest in city planning/management. It's already quite cheap normally, but when it's on sale there should definetely be no excuse for not buying this game if you think you will like it.

If you played the new SimCity and often thought "Huh, that seems like a dumb feature," you'll probably find that SimCity 4 alleviates most of these complaints. In my mind, there are three key differences between this game and the newest SimCity:\n\n1. Non-agent based simulation: SC4 instead opts for a big-picture, numbers-based simulation. You'll find that this opens up many features that are highly preferrable to the agent modelling in the new SimCity, while still maintaining an acceptable level of simulation. This leads into the next difference.\n\n2. City / Region size: With the less intensive processing involved in all the population dynamics, cities and regions are MUCH larger than the new game. There are no bare spots between cities; the whole world is yours to control. Want to make a complex highway system, servicing key neighborhoods and moving high volumes of traffic? Go right ahead. Highways are woefully prebuilt in the new game. Would you instead like to focus on public transit? The options are all there and in greater depth than the new SimCity. As a result of the larger size, the game feels much more open to creativity despite the lack of curved roads.\n\n3. Modding: While the newest game just recently announced support for offline mods, you'll find that SC4 is far better off in the modding community. Many overhaul mods are available to give more transit options, better modelling, more buildings, and other assorted features. If you don't like something about this game, it's likely there's a mod to fix it.\n\nThose three features are the main reasons why SimCity 4 is a far more rewarding experience than the new SimCity will ever be. Considering all this, and that SC4 can be had for $5 very easily, why would you choose the new one?\n\nI'm just now picking up a copy on Steam because who knows when my old CD will stop working from damage or something.","February 5, 2014","true","10.8"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

You zone land, it starts constructing, then you have plausible buildings start to pop up. Something I can't stand about modern city simulators is this cheesy, colourful, unrealistic look it has.

I used the same disc on each of my computers since then, until the game stopped working with Windows 10 and I was forced to buy the game again on Steam. That said, the Steam version works even better than the CD version, crashing much less frequently and supporting custom screen resolutions. Though somewhat old, Sim City 4 continues to provide me with hours and hours of entertainment, and due to its extensive modification support and huge map regions, it still has better functionality than newer city-building simulators such as SimCity (2013) or Cities: Skylines.

Another thing I've noticed about this game is that, you need a lot of patience and most people don't bother and they give up. The reality is SimCity 4 is very strategic because, you must think way ahead of time when laying out your city and think of future problems like traffic. I'd suggest taking your time and not try to rush growth of your city because, you'll run out of funds very early. It takes time to build a solid foundation so that you can have a decent mount of monthly income. Everyone who plays this game figure out what strategy works for them but, don't let the occasional frustration steer you away.

Elected Mayor over a city-to-be or existing city, manage city development by laying roads, plotting land and zoning, constructing public service buildings and maintaining financial balance as you thrive to build a megalopolis.\n\nPros: You are giving a lot of flexibility, from zoning density to street type. As your city grow, additional selection of power plants become available, and additional needs are requested such as water treatment facilities, trains and subways, ports and airports, as well as a variety of educational establishments, health and emergency services. You have a good list of additional tax options, each with their own downside and benefits. Keep a balance between how much financing you can afford, and how much you need, to give to each of your public services (as a whole or per individual buildings). More special buildings and landmarks become available as your population rises. You can even connect your different cities togetter with your streets, highways and railroads, if they are located on neighboring tiles on the map.\n\nCons: You are limited to determining individual land plots and zoning type, with little control on what will actually be built. You may have small shops and fast food being build on high-density commercial areas you were planning to have towering office buildings on, or maybe cheap low-cost apartment blocks will appear on residential zones you wanted luxury condos in. City interconnection requires you to actually build the neighboring city, its streets not necessarily being aligned with each other's connections. Tax revenue is hard to come by, and you'll often catch yourself speeding up time and wait years to get enough money to continue building without resorting to high-interest loans. Public service coverage is radius-based, which forces you to finance overlapping territory, or leave out coverage in-between your schools, police stations and hospitals.\n\nVerdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you\n\nThe amount of micro-management you have, plotting individual land plots, and the amount of effort it needs to reach actual high-density buildings, makes SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition more of a town simulator than a large urban sky-scrapper city simulator. Still, it remains a good example of the genre and the best game in its franchise.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","February 8, 2015","true","156.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Back then, I must have clocked in hundreds of hours of playtime and to this day it remains my favorite city builder of all time.\n\nThe graphics, although they may appear a little dated to modern eyes, still hold up exceptionally well.\n\nThe most important aspect, the gameplay, is just as great as it was back in the day. You can create everything from a polluted industrial wasteland to a shining metropolitan utopia and everything in-between. Although easy to learn, the game can be quite complex; you can manage everything from the topography to transportation routes in your city.\n\nAlthough a minor point, it's worth mentioning that SimCity 4's soundtrack is superb. It definitely contributes to the game.\n\nAdditionally, I have heard that there is a thriving modding community for this game. I have not tried any mods myself, but I'm sure they add a lot of great features.\n\nIf I have one minor criticism it's that on modern hardware a little work is required to get everything running as it should be, but other than that I have had no issues.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend SimCity 4, especially if you like city builders. It is a classic and easily one of the best examples of its genre.","April 29","true","28.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Great interface, easy to understand the game even though it may seem hard at first but, when you begin to delve into the complications of connecting regions it is another world of fun and excitement.\n\nPersonally, the connection of regions improves the game ten-fold as having a city for residential for then your sims to get up in the morning and travel on your brilliant highway system to work in your fine industry of manufacturing or high tech industry. I think that the game appeals to practically everyone, even if city management isn't your 'thing'.\n\nNot to mention the fact that the game has hours upon hours of gameplay even if you think your 'done'. (doubt it) The game also has a very well done soundtrack that mostly has good songs to keep you motivated when playing.\n\nRegardless, if you haven't tried Sim City 4 then you are missing out.\n\n","January 12","true","54.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The need to be always connected to the Internet in SImCity 5 killed the game for me, I love the option of Online Interaction but hate that I cannot play the game as a single player Offline; thanks again Origin!  The addition of Sim interaction in this game was wonderful, the ability to add your own Sims to your cities and get their oppionions about specific things was sorley missied in this title's predicesors.  Having played all previous versions I had always longed for an in-game method for dertermining which things about my city were small annoyances to my populace but not major enough for my advisors to complain about.  These things would affect your mayoral rating as well as have an effect on which Sims would move into and out of certian areas.  Furthermore, the addition of the "Piloting" mechanics added a new layer of depth to the game while offering new construction options to the player for accomplishing different missions.

In my humble opinion, this product right here is the pinnacle of city building simulator games humanity has ever been able to create. Don't be blindsided by later releases of this franchise or any other city building franchise for that mater. Sim City 4 builds upon previous entries in the franchise and doesn't fail to deliver. Neglect the fact that its old, it still looks fantastic and runs well on modern and old systems alike.\n\nYou might ask yourself: city building must sure be boring. You little fool, you have no idea what you're missing. Planning out industrial, residential, commercial office zones, watching them grow, setting up hospitals, fire, police and schools so the city can evolve, planning out streets, roads, highways, mass transit systems, water, trash, energy so the city can live... this game has it all. I won't go into detail as there would be too much to tell, but its worthy to mention that in the end, you can crash all your hard work by calling a giant robot to destroy the city... or maybe spawning a volcano in the middle of downtown.

Looking in the forums and online there are all sorts of tricky things you can do to improve the performance with newer hardware, but that is a hassle.  If you are lucky enough to get it running well on your machine, this is the definitive version of Sim City, way better than the newest iteration.

The Graphics are very detailed and realistic. You can build more than one city on the same map. Not to mention importing your own Sims from "The Sims" into the game. Your city just doesn't sleep like that of SimCity 3000. You see your people walking about and running their daily lives, like walking their dogs, Driving to the supermarket, Driving their kids to school even going to church!\nThe biggest improvement that I saw in SimCity 4 were the disasters. In SimCity 3000 you had like what? 4? In SimCity 4 you get over eight disasters. The best part is that you can control and decide where your Tornado goes. You also get Volcanoes that erupt, Erathquakes that bury houses and split open the earth, Meteor showers that leave everlasting craters and\nLightning Bolts, Fires, Riots, Floods, Mudslides, Bank Robberies and even Car chases. You get to choose you terrian styles. You can ahve an African style with Rhino's and Giraffes. Sometimes they can even stampede into your city.\nThe other great thing about SimCity 4 is the terrian tools. You can sculpt gorgeous, Lagoons, Cliffs, Craters, Valleys and even place galiciers. Then you have the time settings. A 1900's Chicago style, A 1950'S New York Style, And a 2000s Houston Style. Then there is the animations of the construction of buildings. When you build your buildings they just don't appear out of no where tou actually see your sims get into their work trucks and start to construct the building. And if the building is of no use anmore it decays and doesn't turn into a huge big purple borded up mess. Then if you want to destroy or knock down a building it just doesn't disappear, you can actually impload or expload your buildings from any side you wish. There are no old buildings from SimCity 3000, The're totally new realistic looking buildings in SimCity 4.\nTo me all this extra stuff makes this game totally anew. You won't get board if you like Simulation games.","July 21, 2014","true","351.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","3"

SimCity 4 offers great replayability and complexity, with an insane amount of player-created content available on the internet. The learning curve is less than linear, with basic city building as easy as it has ever been, but end-game being at least as complicated as it has ever been (GameFAQs has some good write-ups to help newbies). The only notable drawback (other than tame gameplay, but hey, it's a SIM!) is how poorly SimCity performs on budget and entry-level PCs.

Simcity 3000 and 4 are the only the ones I've played and generally see them on par as each other, whilst Simcity 4 is more detailed, there are some certain quirks that I dislike about 4 (i.e. vanishing traffic).\n\nHowever, like Simcity 3000, Simcity 4 bathes in interaction, immersive sound and introspection. The game is highly polished compared to other recent city builder games (City Life series I'm looking at you), and although lacks a proper 3D engine has a definite charm to it.

SimCity 4 and Age of Mythology where the two games that got me into gaiming. I ♥♥♥♥♥♥ LOVE this game!. The graphics are dated but what do you excpect from a game made in 2003. The game has endless replay-ability. From constructing mega cities to making small towns piled beneath 120 tons worth of nappies and crisp packets, this game is the best simcity out there. In my opinion.\n\nThe game has the ability to do contract work like flying a helicopter to writing swear words in the sky or chasing down a bank robber in a police car like robocop. I can't even begin to try to comprehend how they coded this as it baffles my mind. This game brings me back to the days where people waitied for games to come out and didn't just demand a broken game.\n\nAll the time when I played this game I had no idea the amount of mods that are out there. The modding community is one of the most active modding community I have seen since a Bethesda game. Theres no need for city limit extensions either the game comes with a massive border even for litte plots. What I always do is make cities into parts like East and West and they look awesome from the region view. You can edit the land, have military bases next to rocket launches and, and, and...\nI could go on about this game for days on end it looks like I already have.

This is by far, my most favorite version. This gives you all the features that you expect out of a Sim city builder game. You zone land for the three basic types in your city: residential, commercial, and industrial. Each of the three zones has three subcategories. For example, you can pick an agricultural zone for industrial or medium density, which will allow small shops and factories. Same goes for the other core zones. Placement of services is critical in the city. Police stations, fire stations, and hospital proximity to things is all important. But your sims want more than just the essentials. They want soccer fields, plazas, playgrounds, and tennis courts as well. Again, where these units are placed is critical. Each thing you make costs a build amount and a monthly upkeep, so thought must go into it. As does how much road you have and of what type. You can eventually add rail, boats, planes, and a myriad of other additions to the pulse of the city.\n\nI have a few gripes with the game though (all minor). One, the camera controls could be smoother. Two, WASD should be the primary camera control instead of the arrow keys (the game shows its age here). And three, I wish the game had more organic choices for laying roads and placement of zones. All things snap to the grid and diaganol roads have a funny bend to them. These have nothing to do with the enjoyment of the game though.\n\nSim City is a relaxed, leisurely game to play.","July 1, 2014","true","4.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Sure the graphics are outdated but every other aspect of the game is superior to more modern titles. Despite being old, the graphics are still pretty decent (actually supports HD widescreen, just google it) and you'll find yourself sometimes zooming in to buildings just to admire the details. Although the game is simple to pick up, its deceptively difficult. It takes practice and planning to grow your towns into cities into bustling metropolitans. The mechanics are complex and challenging but also very rewarding to master. I have logged hundreds of hours on this game over the years creating vast multi-city regions.\n\nOnce you think you've covered all of the game, finally grew some elusive skyscrapers (or whatever your goal is), there is still a plethora of mods available to you. Whether you want real life buildings, fantasy buildings, custom regions (some created using real life data), or advanced networking/traffic capabilities, there is something for everyone. This game is now 10+ years old and there is still custom content being created on nearly a daily basis.

SimCity 4 and Age of Mythology where the two games that got me into gaiming. I ♥♥♥♥♥♥ LOVE this game!. The graphics are dated but what do you excpect from a game made in 2003. The game has endless replay-ability. From constructing mega cities to making small towns piled beneath 120 tons worth of nappies and crisp packets, this game is the best simcity out there. In my opinion.\n\nThe game has the ability to do contract work like flying a helicopter to writing swear words in the sky or chasing down a bank robber in a police car like robocop. I can't even begin to try to comprehend how they coded this as it baffles my mind. This game brings me back to the days where people waitied for games to come out and didn't just demand a broken game.\n\nAll the time when I played this game I had no idea the amount of mods that are out there. The modding community is one of the most active modding community I have seen since a Bethesda game. Theres no need for city limit extensions either the game comes with a massive border even for litte plots. What I always do is make cities into parts like East and West and they look awesome from the region view. You can edit the land, have military bases next to rocket launches and, and, and...\nI could go on about this game for days on end it looks like I already have. So just buy it nomatter what price. £9.99 is still too little for this timeless classic.\n\n∞/10\nWould put down 10 Tokyoo Towers again.","January 9, 2015","true","20.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This applies to the retail build but unless EA quietly made changes before it appeared on Steam, should still apply to the Steam version.\n\nNow then, a game thats over 10 years old is still miles better than its 2 year old sucessor. How is this possible you say? No restrictions on city size, more transportation options, never required Internet connection in the first place.  Throw in game altering mods like Colossal Addon Mod and what could be considered an unofficial expansion pack, Network Addon Mod and you have near perfection.\n\nSure its a bit buggy and crash prone and no widescreen support but there's guides on the Internet on using what launch options to fix the widescreen issue and lessen the blow. Only downside is that I don't get a landmark commerating the server failure.

There's a mind-boggling level of content in this game (not even including mods available online), and it's just sandboxy enough to let you do whatever you want, and yet there are plenty of things you have to properly work for. You can be a bad mayor, a good mayor, a hilarious mayor, or an evil mayor , and the game works no matter what you do.\n\nOne downside is it takes a really long amount of time to get a city to a proper Manhattan level where you start getting skyscrapers and such, but a lot of people would just consider that as a plus anyway (As for me, I'm ambivalent about it).\n\nThe other downside is that even though there is way more content than SimCity 2000,  there are no arcologies.

Because at the time, I didnt really know too much about the game, but I kept failing, and kept playing. That's how good the game was.

Mess? I honestly forgot how amazing the previous SimCity games were! I used to play SimCity 3000 UK but I've never played SimCity 4. Although this is a bit dated now, it is still amazing, the landscaping works really well, the roads, tracks, motorways etc work nicely and the buildings and structures are pretty nice models seems this game states it was released in 2003.\n\nThe graphics are good, Obviously a little dated but... You'd know that, the only thing I wish it had in video settings was 1080p. [ READ BELOW ]\n\n-- UPDATE: Thanks to user "Damon Gant", you can go to 1080p easily, you need to go into "Launch Options" and type / copy & paste "-CustomResolution:enabled -r1920x1080x32". Works brilliantly, Icons are a little small but still clear.\n\nOne extra little thing I liked was the ability to play as a Sim inside your city... Driving a car, truck, boat, helicopter and\nplane... This doesn't seem to add anything useful to the game but it's a nice feature to have!\nOnly things I don't like about this game are the fact that bridges can't go diagonal and the building zones can't go diagonal.\n\nI think this game is near-perfect, Noticed no bugs, glitches, freezes or crashes. I'd also imagine that majority of people can play this as it isn't a demanding game.\n\nThis is now my favourite City building game, It was CitiesXL but that game has annoying bugs etc.\n\n-- Side note after playing a couple hours.

Yeah, so if you had the origanal "The Sims", you can "import" that charater to be an individual "Blessed by the god, known as Mayor" in your city. A rather unused feature.\n\nThe only problem is people in this game don't like to use public transit, even if you forced them. Commercal zones don't quite develope or have enough demand and job creation. Also everything has to be severly under budget to stay in the green, even if the Sims go to school, they don't really go to school to justify 200 student capacity and 15 teachers when only 17 attend. It would just be cheaper with no schools and emergancy services even if the advisers ♥♥♥♥ and moan.

Given the chance, I'd shout my praises for this game from the mountaintops if it meant more people bought it instead of it's newer counterpart 'Sim City'.\n\nTo begin It's arguably the highest point of the Sim City series. It looked gorgeous for it's time and had an absolutely fantastic soundtrack, but the new Sim City can offer that. What this Sim City can offer is a richly detailed economy, real simulation behind the scenes, and huge maps to stretch your legs in. You can modify the terrain to your whim as well! No borders whatsoever, the entire region can be built and modified on.\n\nDespite the fact the building isn't as micromanage-y, every little facet of your city can be managed from the pipes underneath to the funding going to each individual city program and service you participate in. The simulation actually respects you, and instead of using cheap parlor tricks to wow you, it actually has the guts to back it up.\n\nAnd to top it all of, MODDING. There's no silly DRM keeping you from playing and modding your game. The community(which is still going) is chock full of fantastic and useful mods such as NAM. You don't have to pay a cent for added content.\n\n========\nBottom line: If you want a good city building/management game, look no further.\n========","February 5, 2014","true","56.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

You can make complex networks of roads, rails, waterways, highways, canals.. bassically anything you can think of. Due to the again VAST online community of modders, who after 10 years still make new and new stuff every day!\nAnd when I say that, that means free and for the more organised teams thoroughly coded, tested and fully functional mods, that have changed the game to an extent, that it became unrecognasible. And all that from people that live for this game, not some employees of some big company doing stuff they are dictated to do as quick and buggy as possible.\n\nIf you like the genre of city simulation.

I personally like using mods for the game, as they can add many more fun hours on this game. However, there are a few issues. The game by itself is pretty basic & boring after time, Prone to crashes(Don't ever forget to save), plus the disasters given are pretty terrible considering I'd have to hit a city with 20 earthquakes to destroy a quarter of it. Regardless, with a bit of mods, patience, and creativity, Sim City 4 can be quite the enjoyable experience!","March 21, 2015","true","86.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game still is at the top of the throne because of all the customization and modification you're able to make in this game.  With several websites solely dedicated to hosting SC4 mods, you are left with endless possibilities in how you want to design your region and cities.  The only misfortune this game suffers from is that is doesn't have the modern luxuries of new games(enhanced graphics, better hardware support, better core features to name a few), but the modification to this game helps alleviate most of this issues.\n\nWhile my time on Sim City 4 is limited through Steam, I have certainly put in over 1500+ hours of game play throughout the years, and it remains one of my favorite games of all time(a game that I certainly keep coming back to over time).  If you're into city building games, this is a must for anyones gaming library.  Even after 12 years, every city building game that comes out has the same questions, which is, "Can this topple SC4 for best city build sim?".  Each game has failed to dethrone this champion(Cities:Skylines might be the best bet).  With all that said, if you haven't played this game, I highly urge you to make this an addition to your library, you will not be disappointed!","March 9, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Also everything has to be severly under budget to stay in the green, even if the Sims go to school, they don't really go to school to justify 200 student capacity and 15 teachers when only 17 attend.

Given the chance, I'd shout my praises for this game from the mountaintops if it meant more people bought it instead of it's newer counterpart 'Sim City'.\n\nTo begin It's arguably the highest point of the Sim City series. It looked gorgeous for it's time and had an absolutely fantastic soundtrack, but the new Sim City can offer that. What this Sim City can offer is a richly detailed economy, real simulation behind the scenes, and huge maps to stretch your legs in. You can modify the terrain to your whim as well! No borders whatsoever, the entire region can be built and modified on.\n\nDespite the fact the building isn't as micromanage-y, every little facet of your city can be managed from the pipes underneath to the funding going to each individual city program and service you participate in. The simulation actually respects you, and instead of using cheap parlor tricks to wow you, it actually has the guts to back it up.\n\nAnd to top it all of, MODDING. There's no silly DRM keeping you from playing and modding your game. The community(which is still going) is chock full of fantastic and useful mods such as NAM. You don't have to pay a cent for added content.\n\n========\nBottom line: If you want a good city building/management game, look no further.\n========","February 5, 2014","true","56.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Due to the again VAST online community of modders, who after 10 years still make new and new stuff every day!\nAnd when I say that, that means free and for the more organised teams thoroughly coded, tested and fully functional mods, that have changed the game to an extent, that it became unrecognasible. And all that from people that live for this game, not some employees of some big company doing stuff they are dictated to do as quick and buggy as possible.\n\nIf you like the genre of city simulation.

This game still is at the top of the throne because of all the customization and modification you're able to make in this game.  With several websites solely dedicated to hosting SC4 mods, you are left with endless possibilities in how you want to design your region and cities.  The only misfortune this game suffers from is that is doesn't have the modern luxuries of new games(enhanced graphics, better hardware support, better core features to name a few), but the modification to this game helps alleviate most of this issues.\n\nWhile my time on Sim City 4 is limited through Steam, I have certainly put in over 1500+ hours of game play throughout the years, and it remains one of my favorite games of all time(a game that I certainly keep coming back to over time).  If you're into city building games, this is a must for anyones gaming library.  Even after 12 years, every city building game that comes out has the same questions, which is, "Can this topple SC4 for best city build sim?".  Each game has failed to dethrone this champion(Cities:Skylines might be the best bet).  With all that said, if you haven't played this game, I highly urge you to make this an addition to your library, you will not be disappointed!","March 9, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game tutorials introduce you to the core mechanics and an overview of how to balance your finances with your cities growth, and then allows you to develop the neighbouring cities into fledgling cities. Once you have accomplished this feat, the game offers various other famous locations to build your metropolises from scratch.\n\nAlthough the game suffers dated graphics, the gameplay is definately not. My only suggestion is that if you do buy Simcity 4 Deluxe, ensure you visit the modding community, who have poured years into the various mods which not only increase city variation, but offer complete rewrites of various features (Such as NAM, a transport network mod which offers unprecedented levels of control of how your city traffic flows, and how it appears)","February 28, 2014","true","100.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And one can see why. SimCity 4 is filled with features and freedom that modern day renditions tend to lack. And despite being 10 years old, this is still THE game to play if you're looking for a SimCity experience.\n\nAnd whilst yes, much of SimCity 4 has become outdated compared to recent City Builders; and it's somewhat behind in terms of the interface and streamlining of modern games; there are few games out today that offer the same feeling. The only game I can think of that comes close to this in terms of offering a balanced and enjoyable city building experience is Cities: Skylines, and that hasn't even been released yet.\n\nSo my verdict: A classic with gameplay that is still relevent. And whilst it's only mere days until the promising game Skylines comes out, meaning that anyone looking to play a game whilst waiting would already have taken their pick, SimCity 4 is one of those games with features that just don't get made the same anymore.","March 7, 2015","true","8.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VitoVoti/recommended/24780/","VitoVoti","Vito","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VitoVoti/","215 products in account","Probably the best city building, management and simulator ever made. Extremely detailed, with lots and lots of well done prerendered graphics (the world, cars and some objects are 3D though, so it doesn't ruin the presentation at all). It's the deepest SimCity, and it's also the hardest: you'll really need to grow your city slowly and watch the taxes, or else you'll be bankrupt in no time. But if you're patient, you'll be rewarded with hours and hours of fun. It's good to be the Mayor!\n\nThere are some problems though. For example, no widescreen support and flawed transit (both can be fixed by mods). Also the game has some compatibility issues with newer systems and 64 bit Windows, so you'll have to use software mode and put some graphics options on medium and low.\n\nOther small flaws are: the driving minigames (you can drive cars, helicopters, planes and even a tank on missions around the city), which are a bit annoying, and can become frustrating due to city traffic and sudden failures. Nowhere near as good as what Streets of SImCity did with SC2000's maps. And the other small problem is that  it tries to mimic the graphic style of The Sims, so most cities will look the same. Still, it's good that they didn't casualize the game to the max back then in 2003, trying to appeal to The Sims audience. Instead, we got the most complex SimCity to date, and I recommend it.","March 28, 2013","true","33.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

If you want a city-building simulator with actual depth and complexity without downloading a second Steam on your computer, this is the game for you.\n\nIt's pretty complex, and near-impossible to figure out completely without a guide helping you or a large time investment. But even if you don't have one, it's oddly addicting. It's less of building cities and more of ruling a nation. Each city in the nation you run has certain demands based upon the surrounding cities. There are even buildings you can't create until your nation is fairly large.\n\nIf you simply stick with one city, you will not succeed. You will have either enough jobs but too much pollution, or not enough jobs but no pollution. Your healthcare will succeed while your school average GPA drops dramatically, or you will have virtually no hospitals while you have an entire city of unhealthy geniuses. You NEED to run multiple cities. Overall, a pretty neat city-building sim.","April 9, 2013","true","46.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you want a city-building simulator with actual depth and complexity without downloading a second Steam on your computer, this is the game for you.\n\nIt's pretty complex, and near-impossible to figure out completely without a guide helping you or a large time investment. But even if you don't have one, it's oddly addicting. It's less of building cities and more of ruling a nation. Each city in the nation you run has certain demands based upon the surrounding cities. There are even buildings you can't create until your nation is fairly large.\n\nIf you simply stick with one city, you will not succeed. You will have either enough jobs but too much pollution, or not enough jobs but no pollution. Your healthcare will succeed while your school average GPA drops dramatically, or you will have virtually no hospitals while you have an entire city of unhealthy geniuses. You NEED to run multiple cities. Overall, a pretty neat city-building sim.","April 9, 2013","true","46.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Extremely detailed, with lots and lots of well done prerendered graphics (the world, cars and some objects are 3D though, so it doesn't ruin the presentation at all). It's the deepest SimCity, and it's also the hardest: you'll really need to grow your city slowly and watch the taxes, or else you'll be bankrupt in no time. But if you're patient, you'll be rewarded with hours and hours of fun. It's good to be the Mayor!\n\nThere are some problems though. For example, no widescreen support and flawed transit (both can be fixed by mods). Also the game has some compatibility issues with newer systems and 64 bit Windows, so you'll have to use software mode and put some graphics options on medium and low.\n\nOther small flaws are: the driving minigames (you can drive cars, helicopters, planes and even a tank on missions around the city), which are a bit annoying, and can become frustrating due to city traffic and sudden failures. Nowhere near as good as what Streets of SImCity did with SC2000's maps. And the other small problem is that  it tries to mimic the graphic style of The Sims, so most cities will look the same. Still, it's good that they didn't casualize the game to the max back then in 2003, trying to appeal to The Sims audience. Instead, we got the most complex SimCity to date, and I recommend it.","March 28, 2013","true","33.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

The game is incredibly deep, which to a SimCity enthusiast must be the ultimate dream. For entry level players it is however a substantial barrier to entry. There is a tutorial, although I felt it could have been a little more in depth beyond the basics it does go over.\n\nBut once you are rolling, you are in command of all the tools you'll ever need to run your city. If you're like me, you'll become attached to your city as its very own life-form, and will want to nurture it along in its development.\n\nAnd since this is an 8 year old title, it was a nice surprise to have a game today that isn't innundated with achievements and ceaseless updates.\n\nSimCity 4 is a winner, I'm glad I made the trip back im gaming time to play it.","December 28, 2011","true","108.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

By that logic, it makes sense build and raze them after each emergency.\n\nThe driving mini game is horrible. Cars vanish and appear while your driving making cars you were going to crash into vanish while the opening you did have is now magically occupied.\n\nI have tried playing this game.

Furthermore the gameplay seemed easy to use for someone who is not too computer savvy and who does not want to get to much into detail in games. This game is too high in detail for me, and as such reduces the fun, it seemed at times a real chore to make the books balance. Further too this the games graphics are all over the place, I have read this is because of my modern computer, the solutions offered as well are too complicated for someone who knows little about computers.

This game is too high in detail for me, and as such reduces the fun, it seemed at times a real chore to make the books balance. Further too this the games graphics are all over the place, I have read this is because of my modern computer, the solutions offered as well are too complicated for someone who knows little about computers.

Any one of these things would spell the death knoll for a game, but SimCity nails them all. To make matters even worse, it doesn't like windows 7 or 8, and will fight you to the death on anything past XP. And it will win.\n\nSee, the sad part here is I actually *LIKE* city-builder games. Tycoon series? Pretty good! Tropico 4? Awesome! SimCity 1? Win. Afterlife? Epix Win. Sim City 4? Eh... mediocre at best?\n\nSo what went wrong? How did SC4 fail it up so badly?\n\nI think the biggest problem was they lost sight of what made sim city games fun... the city building and the balancing of economy against people's desires. These things all exist in Sim City, and they've been inflated to a status of excessive grandeur, but that may be where the problem is: too much of a good thing.\n\nYes, there's lots of buildings, tons of them in fact... but it mostly just turns into a bogged down mess of junk to sort through if you want to have even a minimally running city at all. Instead of having a reasonable juggling act of a few major things your people need to be happy, tempered by a limited economy, Sim City 4 just throws all caution to the wind and piles on heaps of useless busywork. It's not even interesting construction; a good chunk of it's underground where you'll never even see it anyway. It's just there to waste money and make building the city more "realistic" but less interesting.\n\nIf I wanted "real" I wouldn't be playing a game.\n\nTropico 4... is a nice balance. It tosses the balls at you one at a time, slowly ramping up the difficulty and keeping the game entertaining and interesting the whole way. Sim City 4 piles too much needless crap on all at once that provides a remarkably harsh learning curve, for a minimal reward at the end.\n\nSim games have typically struck a wonderful balance in the past between the work and reward aspects, and gave you the tools needed to quickly and efficiently manage your little slice of heaven (or both heaven and hell if playing afterlife =P ). SC4 just kinda drops the ball (to maintain the juggling metaphor from the previous paragraph) by giving slow, irritating, clunky tools which technically "get the job done", but are a pain to use and not very fun.\n\nToss in the severe glitches, and absolute, seething hatred SC4 has for pretty much anything above WinXP, and you may as well not even bother considering it. There's simply better games out there... Cities XL for the obsessive compulsive "realistic" city builder, Tropico 4 for those who want a great storyline and awesome gameplay with proper balance of being "just right" a la goldilocks... and afterlife or sim city classic if you're nostalgic.\n\n\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nSC4 really just doesn't have a place in the city builder market. Anything it does, other games do better. Much, much better. Game-breaking glitches don't help it's argument, either.\n\n\nOverall Score: About 40%. If you can get it to run, it's not really BAD... it's just not particularly good, and you can do better for lower cost, anyway. The music's pretty epic, though.","November 27, 2013","false","4.8"," 24 of 63 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","24","63","0","1"

Yet after two occurences already I have found SimCity 4 lacks a very useful tool that most games actually have and is very useful for those "on a roll" so to speak and has little time to think about 'saving' the f'ing game this "tool" is known to many as, bear with me now, AUTO-SAVE. What?! How?! Oh My God?! Yes I know what your thinking, and I know this will never be implemented into this 12 year old game so i've given up.\n\nSince SC4 dislikes the player actually doing good in a game and/or working hard while having fun making the best god damn city man has ever seen! i.e. SimCity 4 says: BEGONE UNHOLY CREATURE FOR YOU HAVE, uh... CORRUPTED THIS LAND WITH YOUR FILTHY HARMONIOUS AND HIGHLY EFFICIENT CITY WITH A GREAT MANY THOUSANDS OF INHABITANTS THAT YOU HAVE WORKED ON FOR NEARLY 3 HOURS! screw it ill just be a ♥♥♥♥ and crash now....again."\n\nJust like that every time i get to a certain point.

It looks NOTHING LIKE the game depicted in the images.  The graphics are halfway to terrible, and the usability is in the toilet.  I messed with it for two hours, and finally decided it just couldn't be worth it.  I spent twenty minutes trying to make a highway, and none of the pieces would connect, no matter what I did about on-ramps and ground-this and clover-leafs-that.  I even went through half of the tutorials before I played.  Worse than this is how often you build an area that builds itself streets that aren't connected to existing streets or builds plots that can't access a road.  And can you just bulldoze them?  No.  I also wasted fifteen minutes trying to make the land appropriate for a beach—seriously?  Why not have the beach auto-teraform if you're going to make it so picky?  Add in the screaming idiot always calling to you to try his stupid roadway adventure (i.e., boring arrow-tapping exercise), and you have an intolerable game.  I'm so disappointed.\n\nWho wrote these other reviews?  Everyone made it sound like we finally had a proper Sim City game again.

People just won't move in to my residential areas, and it's not very user friendly, and therer's barely any ways to make money! If you fixed this stuff,and also added in the new features that you can get from the game on the games website, then this game would be the best! Please!!!

Theres a better way to build cities of the future now built in layers with residental ontop and commercial at the bottom and no roads or cars for local transport. Google The Venus project and you will see what I mean. Still if you want to expierence just the management side of things this game still offers you the capatalistic approach.

I used to play it a lot on a Mac. I would still love to play it.\n\nBut not this releaes, not this version. The tools and interface are clunky in the best situation. That's the nicest thing I can say about it.\n\nHere's this great game, but you ... just ... can't ... quite ... access it. The interface has a mind of its own, which bears little resemblance to what you want to do (let alone any kind of reality-sim). For example, why, on a completely flat and empty plain, can a cloverleaf only be placed at a 45 degree angle to the grid? Why can't I decide for myself how I want to place it?\n\nYou end up building a highway, destroy it, build it again .... and so on until you get something vaguley like what you were after. Or your budget runs out.\n\nThere it is, just out of reach, the fun game I used to play. It is an exercise in extreme frustration. I am going to delete this game and hope I can erase it from my memory.","May 17, 2014","false","23.4"," 24 of 66 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","24","66","2","2"

This is a middle of the road SimCity title; overall not as good as SimCity 3000, but vastly superior to Societies and SimCity 5. The game lacks many of the eccentricities that made the franchise so much fun, but from a purely technical standpoint, it is probably the high point of the series. The steam version of the game will crash to desktop seemingly at random. Sometimes after a few minutes of play, sometimes after a few hours. Be sure to save often if you do not want to lose hours worth of work.\n\nPositives\n+Realistic graphics, especially compared to earlier games in the series.\n+Large maps able to support massive (for a city simulation game) cities.\n+Varied building types, utilities and transportation options.\n\nNegatives\n-Lacks the color and sense of humor of SimCity 2000 and 3000.\n-No curved roads mean many of your cities will end up looking like nearly identical grids.\n-It is difficulty to integrate cities with the waterfront. Most default maps have ground level set on high bluffs hundreds of feet above the waterline.\n-Often crashes to desktop for no apparent reason.\n\nOverall\n6/10\n\nAt time of initial release (2003)\n9/10","December 21, 2014","true","61.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My only hope is that with the new Sim City reboot, they bring back Streets of Sim City and Sim Copter, both of which integrated with older versions of Sim City. Ideally, they could be built straight into the game. Sim City 4 had vehicle missions but you it all took place in the isometric view.","July 20, 2012","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
