Don't let the 'cute and casual' appearance turn you away. Spread across 30 levels you are tasked with building vehicles to collect Keebles in a fragile glass bubble.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRoHiWngJe8\nStarting each level you are placed into workshop phase where you experiment with building vehicles. Given basic construction pieces with simple design logic initially, progression rewards both new items and more difficult obstructions to pass. Can happily say controls were both intuitive and user-friendly. Quite similar to Spore or World of Goo which another reviewer mentioned.\n\nObjectives for 100% runs included, collecting 3 Keebles, using less pieces then required and beating a timer. These rewarded up to 5 stars per level, so for completionists this would take some time. While this does provide a challenge the fun really does lay in vehicle experimentation with the unlockable items, quite amazing what can be pulled off with some twitch skills. :)\n\nPersonally I enjoyed the visual style, clean vector based art with an upbeat snes era soundtrack. While Keebles doesn't bring anything new to the table it's a solid physics based puzzler that's hard to fault. If you liked similar games in the past (such as those mentioned above) I can recommend checking it out or shortlisting.

You build a contraption and overcome obstacles. With ten different parts that all bring something unique to the table. The true joy of Keebles lies in seeing your creation accomplish a goal or fail and explode in a horrific manner. Purposefully setting too many rockets on your machine; then watching it fly through the air and smash against the ground. Can be as satisfying, as completing a level. Sadly the game holds back these chaotic tendencies in favor of a more traditional mobile scheme. Collect stars(Keebles), beat speed goal. Etc. Nonetheless Keebles is fun, addictive and has plenty of replay value. With 31 levels to enjoy and master.\nThe game is extremely family friend and just about anyone can enjoy this title. I just wish it came with a level editor or an area to let me goof off and build whatever. Also the menus scream iOS/Andriod.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/l73PEG2Sneo\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","March 27, 2015","true","3.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

Yes, Keebles; these small but cute creatures need your help, and something to do with a whale! Need I say more?\n\nThe idea of the game is to create a vehicle that will carry your ‘Bobble’ around the level, upon touching a Keeble it will jump aboard your vehicle, taking them to safety at the end of each level and in return you’ll earn a Star rating out of 5. This rating will depend on how many Keebles you rescue, time taken to do so and parts used to build the vehicle.\n\nNow onto the workshop where you begin to create your master plan to save all the Keebles, well at least try (thinking caps required). Design, alter, improve the 3 simple steps into saving them all. The workshop itself is very straight forward, within 10 minutes and a few clicks, you’ll be creating a whole bunch of creative vehicles to help save the Keebles. Now as the game is physics based, a lot of trial and error is needed but thankfully the game has zero loads times so switching between the levels, restarting or heading back to the Workshop is only a button press.\n\nThe game displays clean and nice looking graphics with a soundtrack that will keep you calm despite the occasional frustration, but thats the whole enjoyment of Keebles. You’ll look forward to seeing your vehicle move through the levels or fly in my case. Picking up new tools like parachutes, faster wheels and rockets as you progress, a new challenge is always ahead. It’s just down to your imagination to create the perfect vehicle to do the job.\n\nSo much fun is to be had with Keebles, you’ve just got to create it and let the good times roll.\n\nEnjoy everyone!\n\n- Blast Process","March 27, 2015","true","1.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","0"

(Thankfully given a little guidence from a friend) I enjoyed Keebles so damn much.\n\nSeriously, the intro song is so damn catchy it should be the open of a cartoon.\n\nIn Keebles you must build a contraption with parts you are provided to problem solve, build, and trial and error your way to saving Keebles and making your way to the end of the level.\n\nThere are many ways to finish the level (much like an Angry Birds) however, your'e also racing against the clock and making sure no man is left behind. Although, a couple times I though about leaving one behind.\n\nIf you like interactive brain teasers than Keebles is a must buy, currently $7.99 It's a unique puzzle game hybrid.\n\nCheck out the first 5 levels here - (Video is still uploading I'm sure.)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/azEXZBNbhhg\n\nFor more reviews and bi-weekly podcast about Early Access and Indie games check www.EarlyAccessPodcast.com","March 31, 2015","true","1.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Pretty simple actually.  World of Goo meets Spore meets lemmings meets (name of any physics based vehicle designer game).  But it doesnt stop there.  There's also timing elements, jump elements, and the mighty star based progress system.  Pretty simple.  It doesnt break any new ground, just adds together a bunch of the tried and true.  I found myself laughing at more than one point in the game at some of the outrageous stuff you can build but after the 1st hour it became a hair tedious.\n\nPros:\nnice designer system, with a decent hint system\nNicely colored graphics\ndecent sound (however, i have hypersensitivity to sound and after a few minutes i had to shut the sound off)\nnice premise, that actually delivers\ndecent content for value (especially if purchased on sale)\nworks quite nicely with mouse and keyboard\n\nCons:\nit became tedious after a while, but in short sessions no complaints\ni found myself designing the same vehicle over and over, and it worked.  But the journey to discover that was fun.\n\nOtherwise nothing major to complain about.  Nice mix of difficulty, design and variations.  It is a good family game, but it may frustrate the littler gamers.  Good value, good time.\n\n7/10","April 1, 2015","true","1.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Be prepared to fail...a lot.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbzNPdP1ToM\n\nIt's not as easy as it looks and I spent many hours trying to design the perfect vehicle for the job at hand. But it is a lot of fun and satisfying when you manage to save at least 1 cute little keeble.\nDuring the game you have to master rockets, balloons, parachutes and more to save as many Keebles as you can.\n\nThe game challenges you to build vehicles to transport the fragile Bobble across 30 challenging levels, saving Keebles along the way. Use the Workshop to design your vehicle. Different levels provide different items to make your vehicle from. Make use of various wheels, beams and gadgets to roll, slide, float and fly. The best design isn't always the most complicated, nor the most simple.
