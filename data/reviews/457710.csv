Believe it or not, while this game "looks" much better then then yesterdays 99 cent game "Shake Your Money Simulator 2016", that game is honestly quite a bit more fun then this one and it scored a higher score in my book.\n\nHere's my First Play & Review video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6PW5lv9FtU&feature=youtu.be\n\nA and D to move left and right respectively.  S slows you down, left mouse to shoot regular bullets, right mouse button to shoot missles that you collect on the road driving.\n\nThe standard Unity engine menu that pops up before the game starts is your only options available sadly.\n\nGame is alright, like I said for about 5 to 10 minutes, but getting any value or fun past that point will probably be rare for most people.  My recommendation is to save your dollar and put it to better use because you probably won't ever play this game again after your first 10 minute trial of it.\n\nIt scored a 51% in my video review, even considering the low price point.","March 30","false","0.3"," 32 of 44 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","32","44","6","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/457710/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","Road Madness is an indie "arcade" racing title that was created in Unity... personal edition. *cough* *cough*.\n\nThe above sentence should've been enough to deter you from bothering to purchase this title, but if it wasn't I will elaborate further. The game has no controller support, you must control your car with the A + D keys, and you can use left and right click to fire missiles and bullets respectively. As far as I can tell, there is no way to manage the speed of your vehicle. Essentially, you will be weaving left and right on a very narrow path, while avoiding obstacles that will wreck your car and collecting coins to purchase upgrades and more cars.\n\nYou will be subjected to hearing the same god forsaken 30-45 seconds of music for the duration of the intro, menu screen, and first level. Luckily the other levels will allow you to listen to a different short loop of music, but prepare to be driven mad for the first ten minutes you spend on this game. Road Madness also attempts to have a story, but fails miserably at doing so since it only includes a small intro at the start of the game. Basically, you're racing for your death for the entertainment of others.\n\nWhat isn't entertaining at all, is the entirety of this game. The physics are just awful to the point where when you hit a ramp, you will be flung into the air and you will slowly descend back to the ground... usually just in front of an obstacle that you couldn't shoot out of the way because you were 100 miles north of land. This game, as mentioned earlier, does not have any controller support, nor does it have any settings whatsoever. It's pure lazy development. Oh, and I guess I should point out that the missile/bullet gauges have a stolen, slightly modified logo from The Offspring. *golf clap*\n\nThe bottom line? Road Madness isn't worth your time, even for a buck. Just avoid it altogether, you're not missing anything but a cruddy experience with poor graphics that are barely on par for a PSX era game. I also feel that the trailer on the store page is misleading, as far as I could tell there is no way to get your camera angle to go to the side; it's all a straight on, behind the car shot. Upon reading the "positive" reviews for this game, I feel like the developer had a bunch of his friends come in and give one-liners about how "great of a time waster" this game is. I'd rather waste my time on a good title, and so should you. Better luck next time, Faton.\n\nRating: 1.0/5.0 - It's bad.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","April 3","false","0.1"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","4"

Controls are pretty horrible, can't turn off music without turning off all sounds, turning off the music requires you to start a game to get to that option, and missiles have no visual indication that they've fired. Even further on the missile issue is that they will only hit the next eligible target from what I can tell.\n\nSave your dollar or donate it to charity, either option is better than buying this game.","March 30","false","0.3"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shortielah/recommended/457710/","shortielah","shortielah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shortielah/","862 products in account","This game is terrible.  There is no nice way to say it.\nThe only interaction you really have is moving left and right, and having 2 weapons to fire.  Sounds like it could still be alright?  WRONG!\nOnce you get above a certain 'speed' (and I put that in quotations because there is no way to tell how fast you are going, or control it) the minigun becomes usesless as the bullets fire behind you.  The rockets also ONLY work if they are targetted to something, which (from what I could tell) only seemed to be money and a few doors.\n\nSo once you get used to this piece of ♥♥♥♥, you hit level 3.  Now level 3 is the definition of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  There are these giant rolling snowballs, which move side to side on the course, and you have to dodge them.  Unfortunately they move side to side 4 times (twice in each direction) per second, and the first one is right at the start before you have any speed.\nSo I went and bought the fastest car I could afford (the blatant Lamborghini rip off), and it turns out which this car, I had about a 10% chance of making it past the first one!  Hooray!   And so I began getting past the first one, and I quickly learnt that I had about a 40% chance of making it past the second one, a 70% chance of making it past the third one, and a 95% chance of making it past the rest,  which doesn't sound too bad, but it really is.\n\nAnyways, so I'm smashing it through with the fast car, and I'm starting to get closer to the end of the level, and you come across these little road blocks, where all 3 'lanes' are blocked, 2 by a concrete block, and 1 by barrels.  Now I've played racing games before, and it's obvious that you should hit the barrels... WRONG!  Each barrel you hit (and they are in a stack of about 7-9) takes 1 damage off you, whereas hitting the contrete block takes 1 damage off you.  Long story short, I instantly wrecked.  Back to the start I go... Oh, and it's worth mentioning that about 5% of the time your car doesn't start moving at the start, so you have to exit out and go back in.\n\nSo I keep trying, and keep practicing, and I finally make it to the end of the level, and I hit the last 'jump' ANNDDDD... I go *through* the jump.  Off into the abyss, and I don't complete the level.  So I painstakingly do it all again, and go *through* the final jump again.  So it looks like I now need to use one of the slower cars.  The cars where I can NEVER seem to get past the original snowball... (as in - I think I've only made it past it once in roughly 30 minutes - and it takes about 4 seconds to get to it)...\n\nEven for an achievement hunter, I would not wish the pain of this game on ANYONE.  It's exactly why developers should be FORCED to upload a Demo on Greenlight before they can even be voted on.\n\nSave your money for another game, or a skin on CSGO.  Hell owning a FAMAS Doomkitty would be better than getting cancer from this game.\n\nPS.  I was also wondering HOW this game could possibly get ANY positive reviews.. until I actually looked at the positive reviews.  They have varying play time (2-5 hours) and have not unlocked a single achievement (very unlikely since it takes about 1 minute to get the first one).  They all also seem to currently be playing identical games, and reviewing identical games :).  It seems the developer has actually paid for positive reviews....\n\nUPDATE: After over 90 minutes I beat level 3.  It's worth noting that you still can't use the Lamorghini on the next level, as it falls through the ground.  Well, it turns out ALL cars do, but the slower ones get launched UP so you land back on the track..\n\nI beg you, don't support the developer by buying this.","April 3","false","1.9"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","15","17","2","1"

There's supposed to be a story, but it doesn't hold at all. The physics are terrible (I went through bridges on one level, and through a ramp on one of the frist two levels), and most of the you can't even fire your machine guns, so to avoid certain obstacles, you either need to be very quick or just have luck on your side.

I uploaded a "full playthrough" of the game available here. It's one of those "a picture is worth a thousand words" situations. Because I could write at length about how shabby this game is, but it's better if you just see for yourself. The playthrough is 9 minutes long and includes the whole, unskipped intro, and one death (and level restart). And when you're viewing the last level - which starts around the 8th minute - be sure to notice how I'm travelling faster than my minigun bullets, so when I fire them, they are immediately left behind.\n\nI must admit, I had fun with this game. A weird kind of "so bad it's good" fun, but still. I was furious with the level 3 bug (impossible to complete level if game is launched at minimum graphics settings), but once I figured out the workaround it was smooth sailing from that point on. Nevertheless, I cannot give a "thumbs up" here. Because in addition to the game being objectively terrible in terms of its components (visuals, engine/physics, etc.), it doesn't seem like the authors put in much effort into it. As if it was entirely a scam to sucker some chumps (customers - me and you) out of their money. This is on the same (abyssal) level of quality as Despair and only marginally better then The District. On the plus side, the achievements are easy to get. So is it worth the 1 EUR purely on account of that? YMMV but I'm leaning towards no.","June 2","false","4.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I don't know, you tell me, I might just be crazy...\n\nHonestly, this game needs to be faster, I would rate this game a solid 8.6 / 10.\n\nUhh, yeah.\nDon't buy this.","May 1","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not only is the game bad, but I think it came with malware. Im not sure if it was the game that did it, but oncd I installed the game, chrome wanted me to make my default brower ''yahoo''. And there was a popup asking me to use bing.","April 30","false","0.1"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","1"
