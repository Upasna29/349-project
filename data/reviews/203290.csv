I've played CS, Battlefield, CoD, Insurgency, Unreal, Homefront, Medal of Honor...You name it! I've played pretty much every competitive FPS out there!\nBasically i have tons of experience when it comes to multiplayer gaming and this little hidden gem is my most played multiplayer shooter in the past 2 or 3 years.\nThe reason ? It's well balanced, the community is friendly and people ALWAYS use the ingame voice chat for teamwork! It's truelly amazing!\n\nHow do they manage to keep the game well balanced ? It's quite simple really. The game only has 5 primary weapons: 2 assault rifles (fully automatic and a burst-fire one. Both can be switched to single fire aswell), a sniper rifle, a shotgun and an LMG. All these weapons are available since the very beginning so a rank 30 player has the same weapons as a rank 1 player. The only advantage a higher ranking player can have is the knowledge of map layouts.\nYou also have a sidearm which is just a pistol but it can come real handy.\nYou also get one frag grenade and can choose between 2 fog, smoke or flash grenades. Also available from rank 1.\n\nYou do gain XP (experience points) with each kill, secure, revive and round/match won or lost and gaining XP helps you rank (level) up. The thing is that ranking up gives you nothing. No new weapons, no new equipment, health bonus, scopes or camos. Ranks only show how much a player has been playing the game. Nothing more.\n\nYou start each round with 100% of hp and 1 life. Once you get "killed" you cannot respawn untill a teammate revives you. If an enemy player gets to your body first he can secure you and your teammates cannot revive you anymore. In that case you have to wait untill the end of the round to get back into the fight.\nHeadshots are an instant kill and you cannot be revived from those. Once you get shot you start bleeding out so you have to bandage yourself to stop the bleeding or you may die or just lose a lot of hp (health points).\n\nThere are 2 modes: Normal and Hardcore.\nNormal mode: You can spot enemies, use the minimap, teammates have blue names on their heads and you can see downed teammates. In the normal mode you can also see a yellow text that says you killed an enemy. This is disabled in the hardcore mode.\nHardcore mode: There's no spotting enemies, minimap can be disabled or just doesn't show you enemies in certain distance (depending on the server settings), teammates don't have blue names on their heads so you have to be extra careful or you might teamkill your mates and shots are obviously more lethal.\n\nThe character movement is similar to CoD and newer BF titles. A lot of people complain about that but let us be honest here: This character movement is way more realistic than the clunky movement in AA2 or BF2. Everything about CoD is not bad. CoD has great and smooth character movement and i'm happy to see that it finally came to AA and BF.\nA lot of people say that it makes the game "CoDlike" but this is simply not true. It's still more strategic and requires more teamwork. Does bleeding out, reviving, securing and no respawns say CoD to you ? Yeah, didn't think so. It's not "CoDlike".\n\nThere's no reason not to try the game. It's free!\nWhen in doubt...Just give it a try!","March 27, 2015","true","255.0"," 812 of 854 people (95%) found this review helpful 68 people found this review funny","95","812","854","68","47"

It might just not occur to them, but reminding them or reviving them yourself usually helps them learn.\n-Only 1 kind of pistol currently, doesn't seem like they plan to add any others, as they have removed pistol selection entirely.\n-No female soldier models. Since this is technically a recuiting tool for the Army, you would think they would target their entire audience. Women recieve the same training that men do.","September 4, 2013","true","553.6"," 518 of 567 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","518","567","0","32"

Rifleman,Auto Rifleman,Designated Marksman,Sniper.\nNo hitmarkers < my opinion.\nYou die quicker than alot other games so its more realistic.\nMostly well designed maps.\nGreat community < most of it.\nWorkshop you can make your own maps and download other peoples.\nFree to play the way it should be without microtransactions ingame.\nGood rankup system.\nWeapons well balanced.\nAll weapons unlocked the moment you create an account.\nDecent launcher and GUI\nNot alot of hackers since the last update.\n\nNow we go on to the cons not too many of them btw.\nCons:\nNo menu screen.\nNo fireteams.\nYou look like the enemy too the us but to you, you look like the us and the enemy looks like the enemy.\nDual render scopes cause drops of framerate occasionaly if your looking somewhere open.\nAlot of people have punkbuster issues with the game. < I have none but alot of people do.\nSniper hipfire is too accurate.\nThat was my review guys thanks for checking it out :D\nPlease rate.","September 22, 2014","true","369.6"," 219 of 257 people (85%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","85","219","257","12","11"

I just treat the game as a hangout and actually have fun with the people I play with. My friends list is quite full because of this game. You can actually get to know the people you play with and there's no point in being a troll in the game since you can just get rid of them easily and quickly if you're in a good server. :)\n\n--Game\nAs for the game, usage of VOIP is very handy in the game. You really need to be tactical and communicate with your team in order to win. You can pick people up and "Revive" them when they get shot and are down, so long as they're not "Secured". There are 6v6 and 12v12 maps each with different objectives-- and you can also play custom maps as well (like maps from AA2 and even CS)\n\nPros:\nGood growing community.\nSimple and easy to pick-up game.\nYou can even learn about the Army itself while playing and loading the game.\nMost importantly, it's freeeee!\n\nCons:\nSometimes it may get repetitive since the content isn't much compared to a pay to play game. :)\nThere may be some glitches since it's still in beta and sometimes you frustrated with the logic of the game.\n\nOverall 10/10 one of the best f2p games I've played so far.","June 18, 2015","true","020.9"," 158 of 179 people (88%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","88","158","179","19","5"

This game is down right awesome. The maps are perfect sized for the amount of people in each game and with only 6 guns to overall choose from, you don't have to worry about overpowered weapons. The community is very tiny, but that can be kind of cool. I play with a lot of the same people day to day and it's kinda cool seeing gamers you have played with before pop in a game you are playing. As far as hackers go, I don't notice a real problem. Every PC game will have it's share of hackers so I won't say they don't exsist. It just really isn't a problem in this game. If you install this game and suck, don't sweat it. Just throw everything you have learned from COD out the window. Put yourself in the shoes of your character, and play smart. That's pretty much all you need to stay alive and get some kills. What I love the MOST about this game is you never pay for a single thing. There isn't even an option to DONATE if you want. Everything is 100% totally free. And you get the complete game. That, combined with the fact that this game is EXTREMELY playable makes this one of my favorite games of all time.\n\n\nTLDR; In a world where "free" never means free. We finally get a game that is 100% FREE. AND 100% PLAYABLE.","March 26, 2015","true","364.8"," 138 of 154 people (90%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","90","138","154","12","0"

I downloaded this game a few days after the beta release and played until shortly before official release (roughly 3 years). And I (like many others) participated heavily in the competition community for this game. So it is with a heavy heart that I write this review.\n\nAA:PG was one of those games that started out with a lot of potential. The team of devs behind it seemed eager to take suggestions and even more eager to follow through with what they said would be done. There were serious issues along the way (PB problems, launcher issues, major glitches), but things seemed to get fixed on a regular basis. However, I started noticing a regular pattern. Much like a lot of other games currently on the market, patches were being issued and one thing would get fixed while two to three other elements were being broken because the developer team decided something wasn't quite right. Everytime an update/patch was issued an uproar arose from the community. Casual players were leaving on a regular basis. The community was changing incredibly fast. The one constant in the community was the group of us who competed in this game. Eventually, the dev team got so tired of hearing what the competitive players had to say that they outright told us they would rather we all leave than continue making suggestions for how to iron out the wrinkles in the game. They outed the one portion of the community that only wanted to game to get better. Of course, with an attitude like that, some of the more confident (and toxic) competitive players began following developers around into games and trolling them heavily. This game could have been very good. The idea was there. The attitude was not. The developers clashed with the competition community and that caused this game to fall apart. In almost a "**** you this is MY game and I will do what I want with it!" fashion. Now the game is a complete trainwreck and will never work or run the way it should have. I've given up on AA:PG after three years and 5000 hours invested.\n\nTL:DR Game had potential. Developers are ***hats. I wasted 5000 hours of my life.

(does that even work?) The previous games opted for a challenging simulation shooter style whereas this game borrows over elements of both counterstrike as well as call of duty making for an interesting blend of competitive tactical shooter.\n\nProving grounds is a game that requires teamwork and strategy, much like counterstrike. The scoping, sprinting and prone options feel more like call of duty as well as adding its own unique features such as reviving teammates securing fallen enemies and healing yourself. The modes center around capture the flag, team elimination, and bomb planting.\n\nIts very much a hardcore shooter in that you can die very quickly if you are reckless, and it is very rewarding when you manage to help your team or work together with your clan. If offers 6v6 and 12v12 maps for servers.\n\nPROS+ Nice blend of old and new features\n+ Server browser and dedicated servers\n+ Can be very competitive\n+ Most of the players are older, more mature & very friendly.\n+ Free to play\n\nCONS- Hardcore difficulty might not be for everyone\n- Is a drastic change from the earlier installments\n- Occasional bugs\n- Relatively small userbase\n\nBOTTOM LINEIf you like competitive team-based shooters like Counterstrike and Insurgency consider giving this one a try, its free anyway.

You basically fight against the enemy team in a nice well designed map with multiple routes. It's about who is where and how the team is doing, you could bring hell of destruction towards the enemy but they're back at their feets due to the teamwork of medics getting involved and communication from preventing their teammates from getting shot again in the same situation.\n\nThis game is really amazing if you play with people with a mic or just listen to them and they will often do call outs and work together as a team in communication which is important when it comes to winning the match in my opinion. It's like those pro CSGO players that do call outs but more tactical and in a game that gives a more tactical gameplay.\n\nIn short, basically its a fun FPS to just hop in and play.

In many respects those are the only things that veterans of the AA-AA3 will find solace in. Apart from that this game seems very much a rehashed shooter. However it is well made. The sound is excellent. Once again you can hear the enemies if they are happy to run around making noise giving you cues to where they lurk. The gun shouts are loud and powerful sounding and very quick to make you jump. The visuals are excellent as well, smoke completely blinds you as it seeps around the corners giving you cover.\nWhy is this an AA game? Because it still calls on the player to use military foundations to win :\n1) Teamwork. People must realize this is the reason for online games. Play with your team, not for yourself.\n2) Communication. If you don't communicate with your team, you will fail. The community is happy to help you out when you let them know the situation.\n3) Tactical superiority. Suppression fire, holding chokepoints and forcing the enemy to play your style to complete the missions.\nEven though America's Army: Proving Grounds abandoned many of the previous games features it still has a solid gameplay reminiscent of the better AA titles, tactical movement as per previous titles (leaning, breathing control, revive/secure mechanics), and a highly responsive developer team showing that the AA series is still alive and kicking.","June 16, 2014","true","7.7"," 79 of 98 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","79","98","0","0"

Clans with experienced players storming a server and playing all on the same side even after several maps of 8-0, 8-1, 8-2 etc. I understand people want to play together, but if one team just rolls the other over and over because a cohesive group of experienced players decide to group and not correct the imbalance meanwhile it's not exactly "just having fun with my friends", its knowingly trashing the game for everyone else. And if you try to reason, the usual answer is: "match balance is not my problem". I guess it's up to the Devs to restore official servers match balance forcefully because the "community" can't. And I say community in quotes because these clans never have a public server running, an open bar, where they give the example on how to receive players and have a good time so people return. It's always about trashing other bars around.\n\n- Votes. Scramble never works. People votekick others for very very petty reasons and becomes a bullying tool. Its the most coward empowering thing ever, since the voted person doesn't know who is trying to kick, so there's not even room to reason with him/her.\nEvery time Red Line, Hospital, Slums, Coldfront, etc comes next, there's always "that guy" that casts a vote for Inner or Downtown and the tyranny of the majority kicks in again. Plus a lot of people cast map votes while others are still playing and worried about better things.\n\n- Game is cluttered and somewhat dumb. AA2 was hard and fun, AA3 was hard and not so fun, AAPG is just easy which amounts to very limited fun.\nAmericas Army lost its simulation touch, with reasonable mechanics and overall clean sight. Now we have bad 3D tags everywhere, that clutter the view and makes you feel like you're using Whallhack, as you watch your teammates moving through the walls. A Kill Feed that gives away TOO much information, which paired with voicecoms it's just a torrent of intel about who killed who, with what and where: (A:"Ok, I got the guy in dark" B:"No, that was not the guy that shot me down, there's another one, look out").\nShooting is only the closing act of a kill. Measuring odds and gathering intel to improve those odds is very important and the game just neglects that. First with poor sound in previous versions and now with the displayed info.\nPeople still dance like crazy with no aim penalty, I quickscope with the M24 at ease all day, while shooting someone 2 meters from me seems impossible at times (for a proficient marksman role).\nIncap state is just dumb. You can't interact with incaps, but they are still relevant to the game. Like if I incap a player in my sight line and I know he saw the flag carrier or anything that compromises my team's plans. I'm not going to walk to him and put a little plastic bow around his hands. It's crucial I stop him from sharing that intel. On the other hand incaps always ask for "Grenade my body, x number of guys here" and some teammate sends a frag to its teammate body killing enemy players without affecting him.\nEasy revives, easy self healing. I mean... The game it's easy, too easy...\n\n- No Army lore or sense of mission deployment. Just have to compare the marketing videos with the actual game-play. For now training is not mandatory so there's no context to the game, the missions are solely build around corridors, small and feel like a training facility not actual deployment. More over the servers are not dedicated to one map by default as before so maps with little majority traction have little chance to be played with good number of players. AA2 had many servers with niche maps with good amounts of people playing in them.\nHeck, raise your hand who ever liked to do E&E in AA2 or the medical training in AA3. But they not also rewarded you with something to use/do in-game but you also would get information out of them and a notion of what is taught in the Army.\nHospital without VIP, A bad Urban Assault revamp (2 times). Maps so small people say grenades are overpowered...\nInner Hospital is a plague.\n\n- Bad excuses to ban. I made a second account because I play every day against a similar pool of people , some already know my play style and where I'll be lurking, so tried to catch those off-guard. On 2 private moderated servers I was banned (after I told it was a second account and they even named my first account) because I had an IP linked banned account in BF3 (!). I guess some folks in the US never heard of dynamic IP, or are just looking for a reason. One of the times I was playing the whole time on the clan owners side, with them even congratulating me when I clutched rounds; they spectated me more than enough.\n\n- To me it seems recent, but maybe it has been like that for a while in AAPG. Top of the head kills are extremely annoying. They were a constant thing in AA2, where you would have someone behind a wall or proned behind a thick frame and you would only see the tip of the helmet and they could shoot you at ease, so they have unfair odds. I understand there won't be parallax in the game so you can't have a view point and a separate exit point, so at least make something in between or balanced so both players are bringing leveled risks to the fights.\n\nThe game of course has a lot of positives, but those are not the ones that make you let a game go and play something else.\nAA2 remains my most played and most enjoyed game, but something like Insurgency even with different mechanics seems to honor it more, than AA Proving Grounds. First time I opened it I thought it was Combat Arms game...\n\nCheers","October 1, 2015","false","570.6"," 213 of 329 people (65%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","65","213","329","34","34"

America's Army has been brought down from its complex but fun features to yet another Call of Duty/Battlefield competitor. Other than the guns being just as hard to handle, the game has been (and I hate using this word), "casualized". If you're a die hard veteran from the early America's Army games or simply a fan of America's Army series, Proving Grounds will most likely not be for you, but if you're a CoD/BF junkie looking for another fast-paced (but tactical) FPS, then AA: Proving Grounds may be the fix you're looking for.","September 2, 2013","false","1.2"," 52 of 85 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","52","85","0","3"

It was dynamic, tactical, well paced, and deadly.\nThis release...is none of the above. I am happy I got to experience Beta for as long as I did.\n\nThe bad:\n- Game crashes consistently (not my graphics or processor)\n- The sounds are muffled and sound as if they were recorded in a metal box underwater.\n- Bullet physics and recoil are changed and not for the better, weapons don't respond as crisply as before.\n- Certain maps (downtown comes to mind) were balanced before final release. Now they have random extra sections that unbalances the lines of approach.\n- Matches were 5min, which was perfect. Now they are 4min, it feels rushed, CoD like. No tactics, no communication. Just run and shoot. Weapon changes means spray and pray is more common now.\n- The images, logos, and general feel of the game is more plastic and CoD like. Gone are the original and lively Army looking patches for Alpha or Beta team, replaced with modern flat monochrome (black and white) icons. Gone are the 3D images of guns and scopes, replaced by flat, "modern" white vector icons. Gone are the buttons that popped out and had some depth to them, replaced by - you guessed it - flat and unappealing plain white or gray vectors.\n- Gone are point indicators when you get a kill or revive or do anything in general. Before it was dynamic, exciting and clear, now it's dull and confusing.\n- The new points/reward system is not exciting. I don't play for the points but it was nice and there was a large incentive to revive. 100pts for a kill, 300 for a revive all clearly indicated the moment it happened. Now I never know unless I look in the top right corner fast enough or press ~ and look at the server logs.\n- Lighting is orange/blue like every movie poster these days, or heavy on the yellow.\n- Team coms are inconsistent and people cut out\n- Game crashes in this version. It never used to crash before\n- HUD is much worse, gone is the soldier silhouette that would change stance as you did, or change color based on tactical   mode. Replaced by nothing and text, respectively. Health bar is a dull plain white again, whereas before it had some life to it.\n\nThe good:\n- Some new maps\n- Op4 weapons on pickup is an interesting concept but poorly executed\n- Nothing...that's about it\n\nOverall, I will not be playing this game for some time to come. Might check back in a few months and see if they made any changes. The sound is HORRIBLE compared to the original beta. All the other little things that detract from the game are bad but the audio alone would push me away. I'm happy I got to play beta though, it was a great game for a while.","October 2, 2015","false","344.3"," 49 of 82 people (60%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","60","49","82","7","9"

The tense gunfights ,due to no respawning, force you to connect every bullet. Unless your against someone with no fingers. As the game is only in beta, there are still some glitches that are frustrating to the player which can cause deaths or severe health loss. e.g getting hurt by a grenade through the floor. Also, as there is no health regen on America's Army, this will put you at a massive disadvantage because every bullet counts. However when the full release comes i am sure that the game will be even better than it is already. The players on America's Army are incredibly helpful. Be it calling out a hostile location or a problem with your PC. The only complaint i have is the developers don't keep us thouroughly updated on game updates or, even ther release of their game, on the steam homepage. However this takes nothing away from the exhilirating experience produced from this free to play shooter. Despite there being only 4 primary weapons and only 1 pistol, every weapon is balanced so they are the best at the allocated situation. Plus the maps are all great and every map suits some kind of playstyle. although patience is required as if you play too aggressive you will spend most of your time spectating if you don't get revived. I recommend this game to nearly all first person shooter fans. But you better have your wits about you as the players are VERY intelligent","January 8, 2014","true","278.0"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","1"

We can't report them on steam because out of the list of steam players we can't identify their AA username to their Steam name.

The game looks a fair bit better but it's still not anything amazing.\n+ Really interesting United States army recruitment videos, showing you how they train and the opportunities that exist while serving.\n+ More options for weapon selection. The developers have listened to player feedback from America's Army 3. You now carry a secondary firearm (pistol), along with one primary weapon, either a sniper rifle, M249 SAW, standard issue rifle or a shotgun.\n+ There's a nice mix of maps available, keeping the game fresh.\n+ Hardcore mode. Thank goodness they implemented this into the game. The problem is, nobody uses it, probably because they would all suck if they did (lol). There's not many servers for hardcore mode. It erases the stupid features which make the game less strategy oriented, like enemies being marked on your map and unlimited medical revives for teammates. You can actually bleed out from wounds, similar to America's Army 3. However, hardcore mode doesn't solve the inherent flaws in gameplay, such as the bad shooting and lack of teamwork. Ideally, it should have been the default mode for the game. As you'll see from my negatives below, the main game mode which has been coined 'user friendly', is atrocious and should never have been released.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- The main game mode for America's Army: Proving Grounds is less skill based and more generic than America's Army 3. It follows in the footsteps of mainstream First Person Shooter titles, which are not focused on teamwork.\n- The main game mode is much more unrealistic than America's Army 3. If you're shot in the legs or arms, it doesn't affect your ability to run or aim steadily. You can be on 1% health in America's Army: Proving Grounds and still sprint around, jump onto objects and shoot the enemy as if nothing ever happened. It's simply ridiculous.\n- You can now medic yourself using bandages an infinite number of times. Have you been shot? No problem, just heal yourself. Have you been shot again? No worries, just heal yourself. Were you shot a third time? No problem, just heal again. I don't know what clown came up with this idea. The only way to die in the main game mode is to be secured by an enemy team member (which involves them pressing a key while standing above you). If you're shot in the head you can still be revived if you haven't been secured, lol.\n\n- It's extremely difficult to locate enemy soldiers who are firing on you, this is because of the poor visual game design and colours used. It's a frustrating chore.\n- The maps in America's Army: Proving Grounds are complex, which you would think is a benefit to the game. Alas, this negatively impacts upon player interaction and teamwork. America's Army 3 was successful due to the small map sizes, which were easy to adapt to and understand. This fostered teamwork, where players stuck together and fought to control important areas. Because the maps were straightforward, most players were able to provide detailed intelligence on enemy locations. America's Army: Proving Grounds suffers from large maps, where a great number of individuals have no idea how to tell their team where the enemy is. There is very limited exchange of conversation on microphone, which is a shame.\n- The shooting is bad, it really is. The guns are inaccurate and annoying. Weapons from America's Army 3 were not precise either, but they were reliable and could hit targets.\n- The game is boring, what can I say? It's not fun at all, unlike America's Army 3. Many of the best players I know from America's Army 3 consistently die in this game now, myself included. Sure, they're still better than other players, but the game doesn't reward them for playing tactically.\n\nOverall Score: 3.5/10\n\nI've played America's Army 3 in excess of 1,000 hours and I'm experienced with the gameplay. It was the only First Person Shooter I've truly enjoyed. America's Army: Proving Grounds destroys the series and is a pure embarrassment, one that has sadly resulted in the end of my America's Army career.","February 19, 2014","false","29.6"," 23 of 38 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","23","38","0","5"

You don't need to spend a single dime on anything.

This game has it all.\n- Ridiculous weapons, like the nerfed M16A4 (as well as the M14EBR) and the overpowered Boomstick (shotgun).\n- Bad community (no offense to you dear readers). You will get kicked on purpose at random times just because you are bad or good at this game (especially in non-official servers).\n- Lack of Realism.... IN AN AMERICA'S ARMY GAME!!\n- Rank Progression is POINTLESS, you won't gain anything from ranking up. Ranks only determine a player's experience.\n- Matchmaking is broken. Newcomers will often be put in a match against veterans that still play this game.\n- The audio is extremely terrible. You can hear a man's footsteps from a mile away. Gunshots sound as if they're coming out from paintball guns.\n-Lack of logic. A person can take numerous large rifle cartridges to the chest due to the poor hit detection yet he can still manage to put up a fight and kill several people in the process.\n\n\n\nIf you are looking for a realism experience, then stay away from this game. Go buy arma 3 or even Insurgency, heck I recommend trying out America's army 3 over this garbage. America's army proving grounds is a game that doesn't belong in the america's army franchise. If you don't know what I'm talking about, then I suggest trying out the game's predecessors which are far better than this one.","April 23, 2015","false","926.8"," 34 of 60 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","34","60","4","2"

This game focuses on slower pace, emphasizing tactics and team play over running and gunning.

Instead of focusing on always unlocking the next thing or leveling up, I play just to have fun, which, in my opinion, makes this game more fun than others.\n\nThat said, the networking code still needs to be tweaked a bit, as even with low ping i've found that i rubber-band around a lot and get shot around corners.","March 20","true","122.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

So, if that alone is enough for you, this game might be of interest. It's *almost* enough for me.\n\nIf you've played America's Army before, then you may understand what I mean when I call this America's Army Lite. Realism has taken a bit of a back seat in favor of a faster pace. It's closer to the Counterstrike side of things, which is a disappointment for anyone that liked the earlier games. Faster movement, tighter quarters, DOOM-style health percentage (down to 1% health? Put a bandage on it!), etc.\n\nUnfortunately, neither the gunplay nor the map design are up to snuff for this new direction. The shooting is pretty bog standard mediocre military FPS fare, and the maps are fairly uninspired and forgettable.\n\nThe game retains just enough of its former self to prevent it from truly being a mass-appeal shooter, but sheds so much of it as to no longer appeal to the niche market it once served. It's still in beta, so things can change, but it's in a pretty bad no-man's land right now.\n\n","February 15, 2015","false","3.9"," 66 of 125 people (53%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","53","66","125","6","2"

You like CoD or Battlefield, you might like this game. I don't think it can hold a candle to AA2:SF or even its lesser brother AA3 in terms of training and real world combat simulation, but if you just want a free diversion here you go. Enjoy your recruitment tool because winning over your heart and mind is apparently more important than making you better than you are--either as a gamer or as a soldier. As far as it goes, what it does and what it's meant to be, it's alright, but not the best. I don't see anyone playing this and being a better FPS player or a better soldier. I think that could be said of AA2:SF especially because of the special forces training section, but maybe that's not the most important thing here. If you want to have fun on a team-oriented FPS free to play game, give it a go. You'll probably like it the way that milk toast lovers like milk toast.\n\nJust to give an example of how this is different in orientation to the older AA series games, my favorite achievement from AA3 was for neutralizing a certain number of opponents in one squeeze of the MG trigger. My favorite achievement from Proving Grounds has been for being neutralized due to falling damage. That's right, in proving grounds I got an achievement for jumping off a third story ledge during game play. My team was mad as hell, but hey, I got that achievement to add to my collection. If you don't understand why this is a radical deviation from the old AA series, don't think too much about it. Just go have your fun. It's free. It's American tax dollars at work.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KayCypher/recommended/203290/","KayCypher","Kay_Cypher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KayCypher/","85 products in account","Let's start with the good points :\n\n- The game is graphically pleasant, and well optimised for any computer out there, that's good work in every way, physics, particles, lightings, textures, everything is smooth, running the game @280FPS, way above what's required to enjoy a FPS on a 144Hz monitor. So good job here =)\n\n- Level design is awesome, lot of hidden spots, maps architecture is very nice, well thought and built to allow players to fight any way they want, open spaces, CQB, strategical cover and defense of specific locations etc... This allows a lot of different gameplay types and deserves to be mentionned here cause it's nice to see some complexity and variety in level design.\n\nBUT, (there is always a but somewhere got it ?) ! There are major cons you need to know about the game :\n\n- Huge problems with the ballistics mechanics, heavy ping and desync issues. You sometimes get frags you're not supposed to get when you shot everything but the target, and on the other hand, bullets sometimes dont register when you put every one of them in the ennemies, even at melee range, full mag in chest and ♥♥♥♥, you just don't kill him and get killed instead, this only is enough to make you go away from the game, this is too ♥♥♥♥ed up at the moment and needs a lot of work to be improved and/or fixed for good.\n\n- The Aiming Down Sight feature is completely useless, since you always have a crosshair displayed onscreen and there is absolutely no bullets-spread mechanic while shooting from the hip, so don't bother using ADS, just shoot like in Counter-Strike or any other game like that since it won't bring you any advantage to actually "AIM" with your gun (apart from sniper rifles), except wasting some precious time to react when engaged.\n\n- About the movement mechanics, well, it feels clumsy at the very least. You always feel like your character is crawling through butter or something, like he's got too much mass to move, it feels heavy, it feels slow, the position switches are stuttering in some way, get in or out of cover, the slide move, switch from crouch to prone to stand-up etc... Transitions suck and don't feel natural. Leaning is okay, but the rest is so ♥♥♥♥ed up that it's a shame.\n\nIn conclusion, the game is free, so don't hesitate to give it a shot, maybe you'll like it despite all the technical problems regarding bullets and ♥♥♥♥. But if you're expecting something challenging, skill-based and rewarding your Gamer's abilities, like reflexes, AIM capabilities, don't bother downloading it, it's messy as hell and you won't get any satisfaction from this game, there are a lot of other games that are way better (Insurgency, CS, Survarium and so on...). Bullets mechanics is too much random and unreliable, so really, don't bother...","October 7, 2015","false","1.4"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","9","15","2","0"

But after random updates, it has fallen for the worse. A year in a half i have been playing this AAPG and i now speak fluent Brazilian Portuguese. Instead of having a Brazilian Server, us NA players have yet to share servers with hardcore laggers (From South America, 0f course). Even the ♥♥♥♥ing optimaztion of the game is horrible. Like i cant even play on 64Bit. I used to be able to switch from 32 to 64Bit but they took that away. After every single update my settings get reset to default for some odd reason ( this is the ONLY game that i have that does this.) Every new update, the DEVS tamper with the gun recoil. Like wtf. And what killed me the most was when they removed the ACOG sight from the M4 ( No Honor).\nPunkbuster sucks balls , i cant even use a macro mouse for this game. The Devs keep ignoring my emails. Only 1 guy answers. Fail Competions.(Hax have been confirmed)\nWhen i played this game , it took my life away. Now after every update, i am slowly coming back to my social life.\n\n5/10 Would not buy again.

The video game made by the US Army to encourage Americans like you and me to join the force. While I'm all for our nation's military power, this game is in fact, propaganda. But it's surprisingly fun.\n\nThe game lets you revive players. At first I thought I was about to play battlefield 3 and 4 all over again. But the devs really balanced everything. You can revive other players once, and use zip tags to secure enemies from reviving. The health system is interesting when you have to bandage your wounds or you will continue to lose health. Very small limited amount of guns, which means it's a very skill based game.\nMy favorite gamemode, search and destory, isn't implemented, but the modes are very similar. Both team spawn, must complete objectives, and dead players wait while spectating. Just how I like it.\n\nIt's interesting, but a lot of players actually use voice chat to communicate with other players. It looks like players that play this game are very patriotic for the American Army. Which leaves me to believe that many of these players are actually US veternans or want to be. There are even advertisements of the US Army telling you to join the military right before you enter a map. Everyone is trying to play tactically like a real soldier which is amazing. Players aren't acting dumb like it's a cod game.\n\nBut this is not a hardcore game. There are arcade features that make this game non-realistic. Recoil doesn't exist, shooting players makes you go down and then be able to revive them, and quickly patch yourself if you get shot like it's nothing. It leaves me to believe that the game acknowledges that people who are interested in joining the army are playing, so are making the game easy to make them comfortable of joining the force.\n\nOverall: 8/10. It's a fun free game for everyone to play. But I might be worried of the chance of scouters looking for soldiers in this game to draft. They might actually draft you and me for being so good at this game. That was a joke. For the love of God, please don't actually draft me into the army.","July 23, 2014","true","14.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Your health doesn't regenerate in this game so when you die, you're out of the round for good. Because of that, it's also less likely to see people running in open spaces for a long time like COD or BF3. If your team wants to win, you will need teamwork and communications within your team. A lone wolf doesn't really get much done for your team than being picked off by the enemy team.

I have hours upon hours filled with heart racing moments, but i DON'T regret a single second of playing this game. You'll encounter these moments where you are the last person alive on your team, the win rest on your shoulders. Will you thrive on to victory or get knocked down from defeat? Even if you do witness defeat you always get back up and keep on honing in your skills at this game. Most of my friends list spaces are all filled with the amazing people I've met playing this game. YES! There are nice people in this world and some of them do play this game. YES! You will run into the accasional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but in the AA:PG communitty "Everyone knows everyone". So the one person who decideds to make chat a weapon instead of a communication system, it sends off a ripple effect in AA:PG family saying that this player is a pain in the rear end and will just leave a bad taste in the mouth of players not making them want to play with that player. Overall this game is one of my favorites! Mostly because the memories you make with your team and the friendships you could build, simply off playing this game!","January 28","true","437.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Roundtimes are too short so you must rush. PG is not like the great AA2,it is absolute different. PG is going to mainstream,the firefights and moving are only a bad joke.\nPlayer who prefer real tactical shooter like AA2 or Raven Shield don´t like COD or CS very much. So you see the "Quality" of PG ,all CS-Kiddie like this game.\nSorry but who mean PG is a real tactical game or the biggest joke it is reealistic have never played real tactical games or don´t know what tactical gameplay is.\nP=G is a run and gun-game with a little bit more realistic then CS. But look at the movement and firefights in PG: Totally idiotic.\nNo real soldier will run alone like a chicken and will strafe left/right when firing a weapon.\nWhen you look at the gameplay in AA2 (slowly moving in a squad,teammates cover each other,no rushing,no idiotic firefights like automaticfire in combination with strafe left/right) and then the gameplay in PG you will see a very big different.\n\nI think the devs will more players in their game so they make a mainstreamgame because you find a lot of more young kiddies they prefer stupid mainstreamgameplay then guy they like to play realisic tactical games.\n\nSo the devs jump on the mainstreamgame so more (mainstream)players play PG.\nBut when you like real tactical games like AA2,Raven Shield,OFp,Arma......forget PG.\nPG is not a real America´s Army game,only the name "America´s army" is the same,but PG is absolute different.Itbetter called "Mainstream-America´s Army"","October 3, 2015","false","123.2"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","1"

I have logged about 25-hours into the game and can honestly say, it just does not click with me as a long-time AA3 player. The death animations and really every animation in the game has an 'empty' feeling towards it. It has a simplifyed medic/rez system that makes things easier for the easy2go FPS player. If you're someone who enjoys mindless games with lots of interior action. (COD/Battlefield/Blacklight/etc.) This is the game for you!\n\nThe community is filled with players just like that, and tend to use the coms alot more often. This is not a good thing, most of the talks are just teenager/young adults spatting and spamming the coms with useless things about their personal life, most of them ending up douchy or just plain annoying, and all of the talks that you do not care about. Sometimes you find games, when people are zoned in the game, wanting to win. It's a 50/50 positive/negative for me, as I may have just ran into a few bad apples. Who seemed to really enjoy dissing others, and me personally. In the end this just left me upset, and in the end I logged off. In the end I wrote this review, In the end I removed the game from my computer (After this review)\n\nIn the end.\n\nIt's not what I expected it to be (AA4) with shotguns/pistol and improved particles (Which this game does have!) It's just I was wishing they would update AA3 and include everything they did in this game.\n\nPros:\n1) Greater Weapon Selection\n2) Lots of Interior Action\n3) Better Particles\n\nCons:\nAnimations are horrible (Death Animations and rez in particular)\nMEDIC/REZ system simplified for COD/Battlefield players\nLess strategic behavior, more toxic and bad mouthed players.\nSound in this game is horrible (All Weapon Firing/Sounds) (Assuming they fire rubber bullets, instead of real) thus each gun sounding familiar\n\nCons can go on and on, but overall I'm just not feeling it witht his game. AA3 is a superior choice, just not map wise or weapon selection wise, and requires time to unlock things. (Bootcamp/Training) and requires you to take actual tests on becoming a battle medic, god Americas Army 3 is so epic, I love that game to death. This just isn't the game for me, maybe it will be for you.\n\nAs it is for most of the kids currently playing this. ;) Real game@AA3 see you in the fight, time to consider switching to the right page.

There are many good people to play with. I'm not sure is i'm small number of player or not because i'm play from Thailand. The ping is a bit high for me but i'm still try hard.

The game have many update and it a lot better than first i was start.\n\nThe game is Free but it with AAA quality that what i can said.

There is a little learning curve with the additional keys but average FPS player will quickly learn and over come.\n\nThe game also features in-game voice so that you can talk to your team and also to be albe talk to the other team too.\nThe game is also balance in that everybody uses the same 4 type of weapons which gives the players equal footing. There is no high rank OP weapons and gear vs beginning\low rank weapons and gear. It is Skill vs Skill, Team vs Team.\n\nIf you don't want to Pay To Play for a game like the Battlefields series or the C.O.D series and gives every player and equal footing on the battle field, this is the game I would suggest.\n\n\n\n","December 22, 2013","true","18.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Using the Unreal Engine 3 was a noble move, making the load times excellent, the graphics average, and the controls responsive, but what really got my attention was the sound. At one time, when I heard a Russian voice coming out of an in-game intercom behind my character, I actually looked around the room I was sitting in, for the sound was THAT realistic. Although most ascpects of this title are either average or superb, there was one problem: Server balancing. This isn't exactly a problem with the actual game, but it can be INCREDIBLY annoying when you find yourself up against 8 other players. For a BETA project, America's Army: Proving Grounds puts other F2PFPS's to shame, but if it were a finished project, I wouldn't reccomend it to everbody. That said, however, AA:PG is still a BETA, and that is why I'm giving this Tactical Shooter a 9.0 out of 10, a near perfect score, a winner of a gold medal, and the winner of a spot in my top 20 favorite F2P games of all time.

AA3 might have been a trainwreck but I personally enjoy AA:PG and I find the balance between an "arcade" FPS and a tactical FPS very suited to my taste. Tactics and communication DO matter - you need to plan out movements with your team, especially in a round's final stages when chokepoints are cleared and flanking routes are everywhere. At the same time, when it gets down to the fighting, you still need the "standard FPS skills" - quick reaction time and accurate aim.","January 1, 2014","true","109.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Being a Free-to-Play, I was expecting more of  a "Freemium" platform, to begin with, but that's definitely not the case here... Everybody seems to be on a more or less even playing field.\nNext, I was expecting third rate graphics, physics, realism, essentially everything, but this game looks great. The guns, while limited, look very well done... The environments are detail-rich, and are well made to suit tactical gameplay (which is vital in this game... Run in COD style, and you'll be in spectator mode, quick).\nI was also expecting a community full of... A few body parts Steam doesn't want me to elaborate on... But found that a vast majority of the players I met in-game were really quite nice people. Helped with strategy, and didn't talk (too much) crap on low scorers... Of course there were exceptions, but not enough to color my judgement on the subject.\nTL;DR:\nGreat game for Free-Fitty Free.

Was fantastic. Then when AA started to die I migrated to other games like Battlefield and Call Of Duty. AA3 came out after the shutdown of AA2 and it did not act as a suitable replacment in my opinion. Call of duty died for me after MW2 as the community is full of idiots and the gameplay was meh at best. After recently getting bored of Battlefield too. I have been without a shooter for about 6 months now :(. Then I saw AAPG appear. Was very skeptical at first because of the shambles that was AA3 but went ahead and dived in. I think this game is fantastic! Its great to play on retro maps like Hospital and Bridge again. I really hope they make more official remakes. Like Weapons cache, pipeline and urban assault etc. The gameplay is very stratigic and sqaud based unlike COD where lonewolfing actually works. If you dont work with your team you will lose. The hitboxes are perfect and the gameplay is very fun. The AA community is great as it was back in AA2. Friendly mature players, havent come across any "♥♥♥♥ you hacker, urrrgh aimbot noob, I ♥♥♥♥ed your mum" etc.\n\nEdit,\n\nI do however feel worried that this game is already dying. Only 400 players online? I hope this game lasts and it doesnt die like AA2 did :(","November 9, 2014","true","50.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crushmaster/recommended/203290/","crushmaster","Crushmaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crushmaster/","23 products in account","OVERVIEW\n\nAmerica's Army: Proving Grounds is a decent, free, arcade/sim mix FPS. Unfortunately, it was much better in beta than in its full release, which was in October of 2015. Considering it is now early May and nothing has been fixed, I cannot recommend this game.\n\nPROS\n+ It's free.\n+ You can't play the bad guys in this game; no matter which team you're on, you look like the Americans, and the other team looks like the enemy. However, you're, in reality, both on the same side, and this is a training exercise. Excellent worldview.\n+ All of the soldiers are male.\n+ No bad content (such as profanity) in the game itself.\n\nCONS\n- The sound in the full release is absolutely horrible. Footsteps can be very difficult to make out, if you hear them at all.\n- I think the graphics are a bit too dark in the full release. I preferred beta's.\n- The tutorial and other practice rounds should be more comprehensive, and there should be more of them. E.g., you should have a level where you can practice takedowns. The Giunta Weapon Range has also been made inferior since beta, with it giving you long range targets even when using, say, a shotgun, and it not having all weapons and all scopes.\n- Co-op versus AI existed in at least one past AA game, and would make a fun addition here, too, I think.\n- Performance could be improved. While it runs fine for me, a lot of people with good PCs have performance issues they shouldn't be having. Very large ones.\n- A more tactical approach would be better. For instance, supported is a bit OP (and really glitchy, which is the main problem).\n- New maps are getting progressively worse in terms of performance (FPS) and realism/tactical design. They're extremely open and full of noob hiding spots. Coldfront and Slums are excellent examples of outdoor maps...Homestead, Stone Ruins, Cabin Fever, and Overload are all jokes.\n- VIP mode? Nope. Medic system (though I wouldn't mind getting rid of revives, period)? Neg. Any new features? Nonexistent. The dev team has been immensely unimpressive in every area imaginable.\n\nThis is my first Online multiplayer FPS experience, and it's mostly been good. However, the game itself has been ruthlessly murdered by the developers. Just reverting back to beta would make the game much better. Do that, add VIP mode, make the game more realism/comp oriented, and we'd be golden. Sadly, it's not looking like that's going to happen.\n\nRest in peace, beta. You were beautiful and I loved you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Freerider-Dave/recommended/203290/","Freerider-Dave","Freerider-Dave","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Freerider-Dave/","220 products in account","Started playing AA back in 2002/2003 back in like 1.6 or somthing like that. Was fantastic. Then when AA started to die I migrated to other games like Battlefield and Call Of Duty. AA3 came out after the shutdown of AA2 and it did not act as a suitable replacment in my opinion. Call of duty died for me after MW2 as the community is full of idiots and the gameplay was meh at best. After recently getting bored of Battlefield too. I have been without a shooter for about 6 months now :(. Then I saw AAPG appear. Was very skeptical at first because of the shambles that was AA3 but went ahead and dived in. I think this game is fantastic! Its great to play on retro maps like Hospital and Bridge again. I really hope they make more official remakes. Like Weapons cache, pipeline and urban assault etc. The gameplay is very stratigic and sqaud based unlike COD where lonewolfing actually works. If you dont work with your team you will lose. The hitboxes are perfect and the gameplay is very fun. The AA community is great as it was back in AA2. Friendly mature players, havent come across any "♥♥♥♥ you hacker, urrrgh aimbot noob, I ♥♥♥♥ed your mum" etc.\n\nEdit,\n\nI do however feel worried that this game is already dying. Only 400 players online? I hope this game lasts and it doesnt die like AA2 did :(","November 9, 2014","true","50.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XVIZack/recommended/203290/","XVIZack","Zack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XVIZack/","53 products in account","This is one of the most tactical shooters I have ever played, ranking just below Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising. All of AA: Proving Ground's maps are well-designed and well-balanced, and the gunplay rivals AAA genre leaders like Call of Duty and Battlefield. The slow-paced, team-driven combat is nerve-racking; you'll be sweating as you carefully defend the upstairs of a bombed-out building, waiting through the uneasy silence for what you know will be an enemy squad. You'll hear your teammate call out in the live chat (nearly every player you'll come across actively uses a mic) that you're position has been flanked. Smoke grenades will conceal your every side as you try to dash away, knowing full-well that the position, and possibly the match, have been lost.\n\nAA: Proving Ground features intense, immersive battles in every round, featuring 6v6 and 12v12 matches of its equivalent to Call of Duty's Search and Destroy and Domination game types. In both game types you only have one life, but can be revived by a teammate the first time around. Also, like Operation Flashpoint, you must bandage yourself when hit or you'll eventually bleed out.\n\nThis game's strategic play style and slow pacing provide the team-based shooter you've been waiting for. People claim that Battlefield is the tactical leader of the fps genre. Tactical? It's nothing in comparison to AA: Proving Ground. The best part about Proving Ground is that the game is completely free and has -no- microtransactions. You don't have to pay a cent to get the full experience.\n\nGet this game.

Kind of... Although I really like the fact that being a team is all that matter to win a match, it's really easy to go "lone-wolf" on this game: Just wait till everybody is down and you can sneak up on the enemy team. But probably it's because I have only played 1 hour of it and need some more time.\n\nOn other aspects of AA: Proving Grounds; since this is a beta, I can understand that the weapons are the classical for every Modern FPS: M4, M14, M2A9, Shotgun, and the M9 sidearm. I really hope to see more weapons in the future as well more maps.\n\nThe sound is OK, but it doesn't have that kick like the ones from CS GO. I'm not saying you should copy the sounds, just keep changing a bit more until you get a better sound.\n\nFinally, I like the controls on AA, especially the "cover" option you get in certain places by pressing 'z'. However it's kinda buggy,  I tried to scale over some cover while in "cover mode" and it didn't let me; I had to walk back and then scale over. This is probably something minor, but this is what I noticed.\n\nIn conclusion, I enjoyed the game so far and definitely will keep playing it. Hope to see more updates in the futures and wish you luck with your game.\n\n-Jose P.","January 15, 2014","true","1.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

I tried this in beta, and absolutely loved it. Now that its out of beta, the sounds are bad, everything looks more CODish, and the experience has gotten much worse.\nPros:\n1. The controls work well, and i like the inclusion of a prone position. I like that you can be very acurate with the sight on the gun, unlike games like CS:GO, where the sight is completely unusable.\n2. (Before the full release) The colors seemed really vibrant, and the asthetics were very appealing.\n3. There are a good range of guns, covering all the usuals (sniper rifle, shotgun, etc).\n\nCons:\n1. Menu's: The game menu's still feel like a work in progress, and the fact that you have to use one menu to access another menu is time-consuming, and it feels like it could be streamlined.\n2.The sounds: The audio is so weird, and often sounds disconnected from the actual firing of the gun. They sound like they recorded what they thought guns sound like, then recorded actual guns and spliced the two together.\n3. Often, you will find yourself clicking constantly, trying to get the one or two open upper-tier guns. This really isn't a good way to promote teamwork if all of your team is fighting over what guns you have.\n4. (Post-release) Colors: The colors have become grittier, and more CODish, the once vibrant landscape is now a pain to look at.\n\nFinal Score: 37/100","May 26","false","253.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a very cohesive and sure-of-itself FPS that stands toe-to-toe with any of its peers. Last year, I was enjoying Ghost Recon Online except for the zany "abilities" that I felt were the only glaring flaw of that game. Great for some but not for me. I was overjoyed to discover that there was a modern iteration of America's Army available and it was much more my style. Everything I liked and nothing I didn't.\n\nWhen I die, I feel that it was either my error or the skill of the opponent - never an issue of silly or unbalanced game mechanics. I've also found that the endorsement of the Army as well as the team-based nature of the game will inject a healthy(?) dose of patriotism into even the most jaded Americans. Example: The "H" key is the "hooah!" button. I'm not even joking. You will be pressing it with glee in no time.\n\nIt can be frustrating waiting for a round to end when you're either not getting picked up or have been wounded past the point of revival, but this is a frustration that will be found in any game that offers the same mechanic. That's probably the only complaint I have with the game. There's always a decent amount of players on, it's easy to find games, and the graphics are good.\n\nTo anyone who used to play America's Army once upon a time, I was big on the series during the heyday of Insurgent Camp and Weapons Cache. This doesn't feel identical to what I remember, but I've found that I enjoy just about everything they're doing differently. I enjoy playing the game and I'm very interested to see where the series will be going next. What are you waiting for? Strap up, soldier.

So glad I found this game because it is what I've been looking for without shelling out a bunch of money for Battlefield.  This is a nice mix between ARMA and Battlefield.  It is a tactical squad based game and it isn't run and gun like COD.  I can't see any reason why you wouldn't try this if military multiplayer shooters appeal to you, its free so just delete it if you don't like it.  The people I played with were nice so far and I had no trouble finding servers and players.  I really think for a beta this is an amazing game.  Can't wait to see the finished product.  People who are always looking for more guns might be disappointed because the loadouts are limited at this point but are sufficient for me.","January 16, 2014","true","8.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

ARMA is still more realistic than the U.S. Army's own game....somehow. I think they should implement no jumping in this as it is in ARMA, as soldiers carrying that much gear cannot jump like they do in damn Call of Duty. In addition, the reloading is unrealistically fast, the weapon switching is too fast, there's no recoil on guns at all, there's no bullet drop or speads, and there are no tactics in this game!!! Come on U.S. Army. If you want to make a military simulator, you gotta be more like ARMA when it comes to tactics. This isn't a terrible game, but I was just expecting a little more realism. I know you all hate me for this review now, but oh well. I always get hated on for my opinion.

The incapacitation/healing/securing system is, however, something A-class which every other game out there lacks. I know it was in the v3, but back then it was not as pleasant as it is here. A big thumbs up for that.\n\nOn the down side, I really dont like that sliding feature and vault animations. Please, no vault. Let it be jump, I know it's not realistic, but hell it's unpredictable and annoying.\n\nGreatest let down? PUNKBUSTER. That son of a _______ was a weak spot in the older titles too, but now it builds a wall between the player and the game. At first, after installation, I set it up via AALauncher, but it didn't work. So I visited evenbalance.com to install it manually, which then worked for my session. However, the next time I tried to play it - BOOM. PB is outdated, *WARNING*. AALauncher says "PunkBuster has been repaired" and the downloaded installer does its work with no effect whatsoever. No AA:PG for me in the meantime then.\n\nAfter all this is a BETA phase game. Considering this, it is a stunning buy - oh wait. It's free. Great package :).\n\n\nP.S.: Change the opposing teams textures a bit more please, I struggle identifying enemies.

I feel it lacks depth and I'm not a fan of the maps. I think it's an okay F2P FPS game though. I love the recoil on the guns (although there aren't many of them)  I'm not a fan of the Recruitment videos. I heard you can shut them off. Overall I'd give it a 7/10. Definately worth looking into when it's out of beta. GRANTED the game is only in beta with a smaller hardcore type playerbase.\n\nLevels don't mean anything other than how much you have played and gaining stats similar to the old console CoD blackops/modernwarfare +100 a kill etc. The game honestly feels very very cod-ish to me for some reason. ( not knocking CoD or AA:PG) just in my opinion reminds me of the gameplay of my childhood days playing cod on a 360 when getting a kill you saw a +100 on the screen.\n\nThe future of this game and what direction it goes in is strictly up to playerbase (which isn't that big) no surprise there due to no advertisement on the game ( heard word of mouth from a buddy of mine who loves AA:PG tactics/hates maps and trolls me for being a long time CS Fan since 1.6)\n\nI hope this game adds some new objectives maybe vs terrorist forces and other real life situations instead it looks like your up against other members in the army (instead of some terrorist threat) also I would love some form of competitive mode for this game with ranks and some sort of ranking system whether its an ELO system or some other form of ranking system, however I don't see that possible with it's small tight niche playerbase.","June 1, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For a free game it competes very well with the games you would pay hundres for. This has to be one of the few games that you in which the players are actually trying to work as a team to complete the missions. I have not played a game where random people actually want to work together. Most FPS like COD and BF series mainly has players that dont really care about anything but KD ratio and have little reguards to life due to the quick respawns. This game forces you to actually try to stay alive and use tactic. I love this game and will continue to play it until the Army stops making it. I just wish that they would go back to all the required training like they did back in the old Americas Army. Sure it was boring but it allowed the players to unlock the ability to use sniper, medic and maps like SF. That was cool imo. Download this game and play it. I highly recommend it.","June 6, 2015","true","275.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Unlike that of CS;GO and other games such as that one, you have to pay money for weapons, when this one gives you the weapons you need right off the bat, without spending a single penny on it overall. It also bases itself off of a very ridgid teamwork play-through, wherein you and any vast amount of players (from a team of 6, to a team of 10) must complete a certain task for any given situation. As I said, this is a great down-to-earth game for the competitive player that likes to do it as a by-the-by.\n\nI would sincerely score this game as 8/10","June 28, 2015","true","6.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Lag will be a problem and latency can screw up but besides that there is no problem.

I like the fact that if your teamate gets shot down you can revive him or once gunning down an enemy you can secure him so none of his teamates can revive him. I also like the fact that if you are shot you need to bandage yourself so you don't bleed out. The community is also great and very chilled.

The combat obviously isn't the best out there, the weapons feel mediocre at best, but it's certainly better than a whole lot of other free to play games on the market.\n\nWhat surprised me the most was that the playerbase actually seems to be rather mature, there's a lot of players who try to use VOIP to be tactical and work together, which I very much enjoy - and of course, encourage.\n\nBut given that it has VOIP, you're always going to find these prepubescent teenagers who want nothing but to ruin the experience for everyone else by screaming in VOIP and killing teammates. Luckily it's easy to mute people and you can also vote to kick players.\n\nProving Grounds encourages teamplay, whether you're attacking or defending. After you have been taken out, you can be revived once. You can also "deny" players from reviving by using cable ties to tie them up. After that, they're out for the rest of the round.\n\nPersonally I would say the weakest aspect of this game by far is the lack of weapons. This game has a very, very, very small selection of weapons and as such it tends to get very repetitive quickly.\n\nI understand that it's meant to be some US wannabe boot camp or whatnot, and as such they only add weapons they use, such as:\n\nM9 Pistol, M4 and M16, M14 EBR and M249 and etc.\n\nI would love to see a bigger selection of weapons, and not only US ones, but also some German and Russian ones.\n\nBecause in my opinion, variety means replayability, without replayability, we won't be playing it for very long.\n\nThe Editor\nBeing a UnrealEngine 3 game, it has the typical UE3 Editor at your disposal - which usually means that you're either very good with it, or you'll hate it for all eternity.\n\nHowever, they seem to have added a simplified version of the Editor, so should you want to get into level design for this game, you have a simplified version available which allows you to easily put down objects such as modular walls and the like.\n\nOh, and should you want to, you can obviously use the full UE3 editor.","February 13, 2015","true","12.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"

Poor performance too. I've been a huge fan of America's Army games. My favourite game of all time used to be America's Army 2 and only recently succeeded by Arma 3. It's a shame to see the route the developers took, to this more arcadey game. I wish they'd keep AA2 running, that was such a beautiful game that had so much effort put into it for years, all for it to be taken offline... when it could easily compete with FPS military simulation games of today.\n\nAmerica's Army 3 took some getting used to, but eventually after beign skeptical it grew on me. However, Proving Grounds didn't.

The gunplay is great. It may feel a bit arcadely for a simulation type game, but that's only shown in the smaller maps, the larger ones are great.\nThe environment is great. Sure, the graphics may not be Frostbite 2 or Unreal Engine but they've done a damn good job of it.\nConnectivity issues can happen (like every game, but very rarely do anymore really since most servers have constant admins where they have ping limits, with most having 150+ limits and other with 400+ and those with high ping will instantly get kicked off or sometimes may get given warnings to sort out their connection before being kicked off.\n\nThe servers are densley populated, like seriously, you'll have no problem finding a full server, there are many and you'll easily find a game (it takes me about 20 secs to find a full server which is awesome). The community is great, literally everyone is friendly and in this game VOIP or even text chat is crucial, teamwork is essential in succeeding and everyone wants to work as a team, there's no "Oh look a noob, let's troll him and let him die", if you go down your teammates have your back. There can be the odd ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or cheater but the admins are quick to deal with them.\n\nThe animations are also solid, movement is fluid, though it can feel sluggish about 10% of the time, for me anyway, it's usually linked to my WiFi going haywire during peak times.

received for free\n\nseen a bunch of good reviews for this game, but they don't hold true.\nthe game doesn't appear to be much visually, yet the tax on processing power is substantially high.\nit's granulated, as other games were back in the day too - though the resolution of the textures seems to be a small bump up & it certainly doesn't explain the lower frames per second.\nas far as pixel colors & the number of total colors being rendered, you should be able to see for yourself the count is low.\nblacklight retribution might be a good example of high color count, but it's more spectral than it is solids.\nthat game runs faster minus the absurd map loading hiccups.\ni don't know if there's too much going on in a single thread or if there's too many threads or if there's too many processes.\ndoesn't seem streamlined as far as programming goes, especially when you can turn off the two light options in the video settings & the frames per second are lower rather than go up.\n\nokay enough about the somewhat(s)?\nwell the gameplay is quite a 'somewhat' too.\nall the game modes i played won't allow you to respawn after losing, not until the next round.\nseems to put too much stress onto me about the quality of my efforts.\ni'm a fair casual gamer & i enjoy being able to move to an area of a map that is either highly active or less active as per choice about how serious i choose to be - with the option to make a mistake & quickly earn an apology (or at least attempt to).\nthe time it takes to learn another person is far too long with this game.\nyou make a mistake & lose, then you've got to wait for the next round & there's no guarantee you'll run into the same player.\nas relaxed as that sounds (recessed really), the statement is clear. this game is for those that put a lot of stress onto themselves, or those that simply ignore such stress.\nneither one of them are good for me.\ni've went through about all the free first person shooter games & it's dissapointing as an industry whole, regardless of whether the games are free or bought.\ni grew up in an arcade back in the early 1990's because my mom was assistant manager at the bowling alley.\ni know how people can be drawn to video games & i've interviewed some to hear their thoughts.\ni've also played some games myself & combined came up with a base.\nthat base is far from met. sure some content is there to participate with, but there's always problemS.\n\ncalculator registration is typically the worst among the games that are visually appealing and|or good map layouts.\nthey need to update the kernel to inject more server updates into the game stream.\nthey need to unlock the wait for 1500 mtu.\nthey need to flag connection jitter & use the other players connections to test the player with the jitter to see if it continues & ban them if it does (with a report from their internet service provider proving it was the isp's fault to get them unbanned).\nthey need to open up more business class operating systems to use a very short ordered stack that allows use of the IP address without the ability to gain access into the network in order to use an alternative IP to prevent the user's common IP from being entered into a lagbox that filters out the connection's jitter.\nthe calculators need to scan the packets for any teleportation of any movement & again do a connection test.\nthe packets need headers for video games that seperate the character data from the audio data, as well as regular internet browsing data needs to be seperate too.\ntoo many times they try to blame the internet for lag, but that doesn't apply anymore.\na millisecond is a thousandth of a second & when the ping jumps up to 200ms, there's 800 chunks of a second remaining.\nthe character movement packets are entirely tiny & can be transferred much faster (at least latency wise) than a full 1500 mtu packet.\ndo a command prompt ping where you can change the size of the packet to whatever server & you'll see, the smaller the packet the lower the response time.\nsoftware is always a heirarchy of other programming & trigonometry will always, all ways, exist with voids.\ntechnically calculus is really only one 'face' of a 3d cube.\nthe 3d cube needs to be created & the cube needs cubed until it is a ball (because balls are the only thing without a 'vertice' sticking out that can be gripped.\nthere's roots to math if you are square.\n\nimagine a ball made entirely of vertices. it is uber easy to know when a vertice is missing. it is all about the foundation because it is what readys|prepares the comprehension. the missing vertice can be seen from the outside or seen from the ball itself. while there isn't an infinite number of possible balls that can be created, the number is resoundingly high. yet the ability to journal each of those balls for any vertice missing is also extremely high too.\nwhen one vertice is taken away, all the other vertices can react to it. but you need to know what vertice you are looking at & what it is & what it is supposed to be.\nwith that said, it is impossible to remove a vertice & replace it with a different vertice because all the other vertices are showing signs of difference as the ball isn't complete anymore.\noutside of the ball can do it & a kernel inside can do it together.\nthey are both impossible to avoid & the only reason to use two is because of aliens.\nsure, a kernel could ever fill a vertice gap. but then the kernel can't do it's virus check at the same time.\nwith that said, the last sentence method is worth less than any particle in any garbage on any planet.\nthe only fight from there on is melting the ball & the system entirely crashes.\nevery single ball serves a purpose & that list is maintained.\nfrom that line on, the only fight from there is all the good balls seperated from all the evil balls.\ncomputers are nothing but progress & using a system that wants to do nothing more than subtract until nothing remains is useless.\nsometimes negativity is progress & still those balls serve an exact purpose. if they are touched|manipulated to do anything else there's going to be two ways to realize the difference & immediately the ball is either healed or destroyed.\nthere is nothing stopping the power of magnetism to prevent a ball from being attacked & a vertice falling off.\nwith that said, the only thing to do from there is getting the ball to rotate to push damaging attacks away from the ball.\nthe only thing to do from there is being able to use the ball wherever it might be rather than wait for the ball to return from defending an attack before you can use it.\nthere's also the option of cloning the ball & using the clone to defend while using the other one to process.\nwith that said, it is nothing more than a table of useability from the particles.\nthey will think they can sneak a particle in that stops the clones from being created, but i already said the balls can shove the particle out & some balls use some of the same particles & they don't require the operating system to use the same exact ball each time to get rid of the foreign particle.\nyou could realize there is ever a 'master' ball(s) that do nothing more than push particles out & they don't ever need a wait time to get something done because if any of those balls grow weak, there's always another one (or a million or trillion of 'em) ready & willing to be swapped out while the weakened ball goes back to get repaired.\nnow that you've read that much into it, you know the only way for those particles to get inside is either a power supply connected to the wall or a wireless signal & either one can be equipped with a filter.\nit's one thing to see a filter table & learn what can't go inside, then do the math to learn what is inside.\nwhat, are you going to build some software only to realize the ball has been banned already?","May 5","false","0.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

Play Arma 2 or 3. Not that hardcore, looking for more of a casual experience?

Training is not training at all! You're stuck in a very short cattle  pen with nowhere to go. Unless "TRAINING" is taking 10 to 15 steps with nowhere to go and nothing else to do, then I guess it has everything covered...OH, you can also jump..  NO range, NO trigger time, NO targets and NO weapons to test.. not even a cheesy narator explaining the game controls.. NOTHING!  Then every menu item you click triggers a freaking recruitment video!  I did my time...I just wanted to play a freaking game!! JEEZZZ!!! The agnoy of it all...  After about 5 minutes of jacking with this "game", their description not mine,  I gave up... and WONT be back.  A game should have an intro, a welcome and then training to familiarize the player with the controls... I dont want to figure it out.... I don't want to watch a bunch of videos aimed at sucking the life out of young people.... I just wanted to play the game as I did years ago when it first came out..when it was a cool game that all of my buddies played...."Like fish in a barrel"... NO SUCH LUCK....","October 8, 2015","false","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Most of the time though you will move up too far and most likely get hit by a grenade and die. Then you get to wait 5 minutes and watch everyone else play. If you dont move up too far you won't see any enemies and be equally bored. There are not that many maps and most people only want to play the hospital one for some reason. I think its the closest to a COD map and people are used to it. This also means that everyone has every hiding spot memorized. This is definitly a reflex game because every gun kills in 1 or 2 shots. I once saw a guy use only the pistol and rack up 30 kills in a match. Avarage is like 12-20 kills. If youre looking for a realistic shooter, this isnt quite it, if youre looking for an action packed shooter this is definetly not it. It is soooo slow paced that i have a show on my second monitor so I have something to do when I die. I suppose when I get better it might be more fun, but I'm not sure I want to get better. There are so few maps and only like 10 guns to use. Not even an smg to use. 2 pistols, 2 snipers, 2 mgs, m16, ak, mbr (or whatever the auto sniper is) and m4a1. And like 3 scopes for each, if you count iron sights. not a whole lot of variety if you ask me, but all the guns are esentially the same anyways.\n\nAll in all its a free game and the graphics are pretty nice, but its just kind of bland after only 20 hrs.","October 17, 2015","false","18.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
