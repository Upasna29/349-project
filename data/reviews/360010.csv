The battle system rocks. How it works is that each character can use every element spell, but they have innate abilities that only that person can use to power up the other's spells. So one person casts their power up (like making it more powerful or hit all enemies) and then the other casts the damage spell. It makes the characters actually work together and need each other whereas in most RPGs, every character does their own thing.\n\n2. The music fits with the theme of the game (It's an eerie castle that you have to explore).\n\n3. The characters have a good chemistry. Even though the main character doesn't talk, her friend still communicates with her and during their short time together, forms a love relationship that works. In the outside world, each character has their own abilities (The main character can play music to unlock doors and her friend can jump gaps) which helps develop their personalities.\n\nCons:\n1. The game is short (I finished it in 2 hours).\n\n2. The two endings that aren't the "good" ending seem pointless because there is no substance to them (they just have the respective character walk off the screen with "ending 2 or 3" flashing).\n\n3. The game is a little easy.\n\nI enjoyed it and I'd recommend it for people who like RPGs.\n","May 2, 2015","true","2.6"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","22","24","0","0"

There are two negative points which I want to point out (but don't be fooled, they're compensated by the positive points I mention right after)\n\n- Theres not too much focus on the story and huge parts of it are gathered through notes (which you may find or not, depends on how much exploring you do)\nBUT: The characters are very likeable, even though one of them can't speak. The relationship between the two main characters is heartwarming, which is pretty surprising regarding the fact that you spend such a short amount of time with them.\nThe atmosphere is phantastic and very mysterious - the music is largely responsible for that. The soundtrack is awesome and supports every mood presented in the game.\nSo yeah, if you are able to connect to the characters and atmosphere, you will have a great time and get more out of the story than you might think.\n\n- Exploring the different parts of the dungeons can be tedious, although every path has its own design. But the riddles there are so easy that you really do nothing else than running and fighting.\nBUT: The battle system is great. The characters have skills which can be combined to have different effects. And you really need those. I didn't think the game was too easy, in fact I had to prepare a tactic for most of the fights. I really enjoyed that.\nI also think that the short playtime benefits the gameplay. Yeah, its a little disappointing to see the ending after 3-4 hours, but otherwise the dungeon exploring would've become too annoying.\n\nSo, is it worth it? I'd say yes, definitely. But you have to keep in mind that the game is short and may want to wait for a sale. I didn't regret buying this game at release at all. Really liked it.","May 12, 2015","true","6.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","2"

In summary, it's about a woman trapped inside a mysterious prison and a guy who accidentially freed her. Now they're trying to escape. And that's mostly it. Nothing too memorable, but still okay.\n\nThe main focus lies on the gameplay anyway. The battles might appear like nothing special, but simply bashing on the enemy won't get you very far. Instead, you'll have to combine the character's innate abilities with spell cards found inside the prison. One example would be to have Celesta steal HP, which allows Melchior to cast a spell onto the whole group. Especially useful in terms of healing, as magic can't be used outside of battle. A second example would be one you'll use a lot. This time, Melchior uses an ability that hurts the enemy, which strenghtens Celesta following spell.\nAll you have to keep in mind is that the effects don't last into the next round. So you'll have to decide which character to start with every time.\n\nLuckily, you don't have to worry about MP that much. You start with 3 and regenerate more with every passing turn. And if that seems too slow, you can always guard to add some more. Quite useful during battles where enemies unleash very powerful attacks.\n\nSo if you don't need a complex story but like a well-made battle system, then give the game a shot. It might not be that good looking, but at least the soundtrack is quite nice. Don't expect it to take long, though. Three hours should be all you need.","July 9, 2015","true","4.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

To escape, they'll need to defeat several guardians to light the different crystals. Once they do that, will the be able to make it out alive?\n\nI generally enjoyed Remnants of Isolation. The combat system was different. Instead of just your regular turn based battle system, you need to plan between the two to set up Spell Fusions. These are essential for surviving through the various battles. To learn your spells, you'll need to find what are called spell cards and then equip them. I found this quite interesting, as it really did lead to having to think up some unique strategies. On the other hand, though, I didn't like the MP system as much, as it felt quite limiting at times. I couldn't cast the spells I needed when I needed to.\n\nWhile it is a generally enjoyable game, I don't feel it is worth purchasing at the full price of $10 considering the length. If you can find it in a bundle or on sale then definitely give it a try.","October 6, 2015","true","3.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Autofire/recommended/360010/","Autofire","AutoFireII","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Autofire/","38 products in account","With a very Dark Souls feel, Remnants of Isolation is far from a happy game, but it is very good. It is not very long, but I don't think the game needs to be. I'll mention two things that makes the combat system special, before going on the general points. Expect minor mechanic spoilers.\n\nRoI has a unique spell system (at least, unique to this player) that allows you to, using one of the protagonist's words, "piggyback on others' magic." You can combo magic together, making what would be 1 spell have 8 or so variations. (Fireball spell becomes Eruption, Fire Swath, Bezerking Blast, Fire Gaurd, etc.) These variations are accessed by casting a Magic Spell (gained through equipment) right after another party member casts their Innate Spell (gained through levels). Specific Innate Spells (with their Magic-altering properties) are unique to each character, so even though Magics can be equipped in any combination, these Magics feel very different depending on who you equipped them on.\n\nThe result: I NEVER told both party members to cast Fire; I'd rather chose an innate to cast before casting fire, saving the one character's mana for a more powerful spell. This disuades mindless auto attacking that many other RPGs suffer from. The final boss had me feeling like a true strategist, throwing every combo my party configeration allowed. My only gripe is that this system seemed to make some bosses too easy; I OHKOd a boss by first stripping its defenses and then blasting it to bits.\n\nThe other, less obviously signifigant choice they made with this game is to have mana always tacked at 3 at the beginning of the battle (regardless of your level) and to always have your mana regenerate. This significantly changes the game from being about being well prepared to playing your attacks correctly. (Although you should generally heal up before fighting bosses.) It also adds a ramping feel to the battles.\n\nNothing is too noticeable about the overworld. Fairly standard fare there. (Although good piano tunes are good.) There are a few puzzles from time to time, especially in the last area. One plus is that there is literally no grinding in the game; enemies don't respawn, though you could flee if you so chose. There are no annoying random encounters that spring on you; you can chose to run headlong into monsters or sidestep them; whatever floats your boat.\n\nThe length of the game, though short, makes it so that you really don't have many of the problems that FF games encounter, such as too much money, lots of redundancy, etc. Inventory management is not a large component, which is a first in my book.\n\nI would say that the core hooks of Remnants of Isolation would be Narrative and then Challenge. While you can explore, exploration is in no way a major component of Remnants of Isolation.","July 20, 2015","true","3.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It has themes of love and working together that did more than just bring a smile, but also marry them to its core gameplay mechanics.\n\nPlaying a lot of RPG Maker games, Remnant's of Isolation's combat system felt like a slight breath of fresh air. The way mana works in this game and the unique spell chaining/combo system allows each battle to feel way more engaging than in typical RPGs. Both party members really feel like they are dependent on each other, and it hits you even harder when they get seperated. This is less a nusance and more of a welcome change of pace, however.\n\nIf I can name any true flaws this game has, it's mostly technical. There are some areas where the game's framerate drops, though it's not bad enough to impact the experience. I was also personally irked by the lack of fullscreen support.\n\nRegardless, this is nice, short little gem of a game that truly deserved its golden IGMC crown. For those looking for an example of how to do an RPG Maker game right, or just want to play a short, yet sweet romp, then I highly recommend you give this game a shot.","January 17","true","4.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

One of the best RPG maker games that I've played. The story is great, and the battle system requires you to chain your two charcter's spells together to form amazingly useful combos. It makes you feel that the characters are truely connected, especially at the parts of the story where the characters become seperated, and battle with one person seems infinitely harder. I had a lot of fun playing this game, but sadly playing it from start to finish takes about 3 hours. The game's 3 various endings add some replayability to the game, but the game is also rather linear, though I thought it worked well for this game, and there were a few treasure chests that were hidden on seperate paths or gaurded by monsters, for the most part there wasn't much exploration in this game. Levels were short and sweet and the games difficulty level progressed fairly as the game went along.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rodenbeard/recommended/360010/","rodenbeard","RodenBeard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rodenbeard/","180 products in account","After being urged and urged to play this by CashmereCat, I finally got around to running through it. Did it live up to Cash's hype?\n\nGameplay\n\nLet me say right away, this is the best part of Remnants of Isolation. I've never played another RM game with combat mechanics as simple and fun as this, and I have to give big props to the team for that. I honestly didn't think it was possible to make a game so fun in RM, but I'm glad I was wrong.\n\nThe spell fusion system is perhaps the perfect mechanic for a game of this length, and a party of only two characters. It keeps combat flowing at a really consistent pace and actually made me want to seek out battles, a rare thing in an RPG. I encountered some situations where I felt as though I wanted to use an Innate Skill and then use a Regular Spell after without fusion, but these were few and far between, and probably speak more about me playing the game like a noob at certain points than anything.\n\nThe battles are either quick and painless or nicely challenging, with one exception near the end of the game- the dragon boss that had two groupies with him seemed a tad too hard, but again, this may be due to me being an idiot. I uh... Forgot that I could make barriers, so. Let's just move on, shall we?\n\nFor what it's worth, my favourite battle in the game was the fight against three elementals near the end of the Nightmare segment. That was super fun to figure out and really let the battle system shine.\n\nThe dungeon design is pretty straightforward and keeps the player moving along at a nice pace. I felt like the dungeon segments were just long enough to provide a good challenge, but not to get tiring. I like the Hub -> Level -> Boss gameplay loop. It helps the game remain constantly fresh over the course of its play time, and keeps the player wanting more.\n\nWorldbuilding (Setting, Atmosphere, Writing and Characters)\n\nThe writing in this game is impressive, if only for the fact that it manages to be interesting and have a personality with only one guy talking the whole time. There's nothing too deep or complex going on really, but what's there is wonderfully put together and makes you want to press onward to the end. The constant talking about the "heart of the castle" really put me in mind of Castle in the Sky, which is a plus in my books. Perhaps the best point of the writing is that the game manages to give Celesta a personality and character development at all- a feat not everyone would be able to accomplish with a silent character.\n\nThe notes you find around the castle and the exposition given by Melcior at certain points does help to provide a good sense of setting and how the outside world operates. You don't need to see anything outside of the castle, or know too much about the castle itself. The game knows this and only gives you what you need to paint a good mental picture for yourself.\n\nI have to say that I'm not a huge fan of multiple endings. The first ending I got was number 3, and Cash urged me (and told me) how to get the other two afterwards. I would have preferred the game to just have one ending that was more satisfying, because none of the 3 really struck me that much. It didn't bother me a lot though, after experiencing the rest of the game it wasn't a big deal that the ending was sort of "light", and I'm not really sure if changing it would help. I certainly can't think of anything I would have done differently with it.\n\nAesthetics (Graphics & Music)\n\nThere is not too much to say in the realm of aesthetics, at least from a graphical standpoint. The game is mostly RTP, and in certain cases the maps are a little bare and uninteresting (moreso near the beginning of the game). The small amount of custom work is nice- Melchior's jumping animation comes to mind, as does Celesta's piano playing. Sooz's artwork is very impressive, very expressive, and probably the best looking thing in the game. It helps give a character to Celesta and really bolsters Melchior's personality, which is helpful in a game where he's the only one talking.\n\nThe addition of more artwork from Sooz and some changed RTP assets in the Steam version is a big positive to the aesthetic side of the game.\n\nThe music is used excellently for setting the mood of the castle, and gives the game a very overbearing and sometimes oppressive feel. I'm not well versed in music, so I can't really say anything too deep about it, but it was good- if a little bit forgettable.\n\nOverall\n\nThis is one of the best RM games I've ever played. It was really impressive to see an RM title that was so well put together, and I can honestly say I wasn't expecting that- which isn't to say anything about the presentation of that game or it's creators, it's just my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bias about RM titles. As I stated before, the battle system is the real high point of RoI for me, it was very inspiring and something I'll probably look at to study for my own work when the time comes.\n\nIn the end, I was very pleased with this title.","January 25","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pacing is the best in any JRPG-style game I've played, so while I may have finished it in just over 2 hours, at no point did I desire to put it down, and I was satisfied when the credits rolled.\n\nIf you ever get that itch to go back and play one of those classic Square RPGs, like Chrono Trigger or FF6, but can never actually finish them, give Remnants of Isolation a try - it'll satisfy that itch without overstaying its welcome.\n\nOh, and the battle system is pretty spiffy too.","October 2, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What I just don't like about it is that the enemies don't make any mark to me at all, like I won't even remember their weaknesses if I ever see them again in the internet after playing the game. But over all, I think it's worth getting at sale price (got mine from the humble bundle).","July 31, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good news, it does throw some other stuff into the mix. Larger on it actually gets pretty difficult especially when you only have two party members.\n\nLove the enemy and character art and the music is pretty top notch and helps provide a decent atmosphere. The characters themselves are pretty interesting. That seems to be the theme with RPG Maker games, sub-par sprites and battle systems but in an attempt to make up for this the story is pretty interesting and typically the highlight of the game. Only issue is that to keep you engaged with the story the gameplay has to be engaging as well or it becomes "no worth it" and you just can't play anymore.\n\nRemnants of Isolation is one of those pretty legitimate RPG Maker games, story and all. If you’re interested and it's on sale give it so love.","November 22, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
