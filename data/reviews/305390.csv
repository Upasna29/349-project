I believe this is Wastelands studios first WW2 game, which was latter followed by Time of Fury and Strategic war in Europe (SWE).  With the latter just being released about a week ago on steam that is what many users (and this review) will be comparing the game to\n\nGame Setup\nPlayers have two choices in the type of game they play. Full campaigns and operational scenarios. The full campaigns take place on a map that is 265 x 180 hexes in size and have an end date of December 1948. The included campaigns are\nGrand Campaign Sep 1 1939 (450 turns)\nFall Gelb May 10 1940 (420 turns)\nBarbarossa Jun 22 1941  (360 turns)\nGotterdammerung Apr 1944   (226 turns)\nThere are two operational scenarios that include\nFall Weiss 10 turns on a map size of 62 x 46\nOverlord June 6 1945 25 turns with a map size of 51 x 24\nThere is also a 30 turn tutorial that starts Sep 1 1939. It is not instructional training per say but every little action the player takes is explained to them. In other words it does not tell you to hit this button or select this unit, but when you do such things you see what they do.   I suggest you skip it and go straight to the 76 page manual which can be found in the games install folder\n\nThe game also support PBEM, and hot seat for people interested in playing with friends\nOnce the campaign is selected players can choose what country/countries they control. In addition to selecting countries players can set the difficulty of each country (Human and AI) in the form of altering the production points it receives.\nGame play\n\nPlayers are greeted with a map with playing pieces representing the units. players can alter the look of both with a wide range of choices; old school paper maps, square unit counters with NATO symbols. There is little doubt players can find something they like.\nThe map is one area where ToW is different that Strategic War Europe (SWE). In SWE the low countries are combined into one little area of 9 hexes; and the France; German/Italian borders are also 9 hexes combined. . In ToW the French border is over 30 hexes and each of the low countries (Luxemburg Belgium and Netherlands) are present.\n\nGame turns represent 1 week.\n\nLand units include infantry, motorized, Armor and Airborne. They can be bought as either divisions or corps (Airborne come only as divisions). Each country also has a pool of commanders that can be assigned to units (both air and land). Commanders turn the unit they are assigned to into an HQ and gives it an efficiency bonus. Units that do not have commanders but are within three hexes of an HQ also get a bonus.\n\nAir units come in divisions,  army and strategic bombers. Divisions and armies can be used for air supremacy, ground/fleet attacks and air recon. Strategic bombers attack cities and are automatically used to send supplies to troops cut off\n\nNavy units are not bought by the ship but by group; for example a carrier battle group. Navel action is a little different from ground and air units\na. Fleets are moved from harbor to see zones (there are no hexes at sea)\nb. Fleets can be assigned as regular or raider. Raiders fleets enter a sea zone and split up looking for enemy convey. Regular fleets enter a zone and stay together looking for enemy fleets\nc. Fleets can also be assigned to engage; if this option is selected they will attack enemy fleets.\nd. During the end turn the computer will randomly see if enemy fleets in the sea zones find each other. If so a short 5 round battle takes place.\ne. Sea units can shore bombard the coast\n\nFast movement: Players can buy strategic, sea and amphibious  transport points. Strategic points allow units to move over longer distances in a single turn (NOTE unlike SWE units do not need to start on a railroad hex). Sea points are used to transport a unit from one friendly harbor to another and amphibious points allows units to transport by sea and land on an enemy beach\n\nResearch: works the same way as it does in SWE. Players can research, artillery (infantry), tanks, aircraft , subs, warships and nuclear bombs.  Nuclear bombs are only one level (you either have them or you don't) and once you do you gain a bomb every few turns which can be dropped by one of your strategic bombers.\nAll the others  come in five levels (some countries start at higher levels than others) and each level needs 100 points to reach. Players spend production points to increase research effort in the area of their choice. Any area can have up to three investments (represented by light bulbs), the first one cost 200, but the price for future ones goes down as the research gets closer to the 100 mark. For example if you buy all three investments upfront it will cost you 600 (3 * 200); but if you buy the initial 200 and wait a few turns the next investment might only cost 170. I seen it go as low as 30 when it was 87 out of the 100 needed. Of course once 100 is reached that level is unlocked and all the light bulbs go out and the player must start investing again\nNukes work slightly differently, there is only one level that needs 800 point and the initial investment is 1000 production points.\nAs new levels unlock better units can be bought at an increased price. For example if you have 4 levels of infantry unlocked you can buy them at any of those four levels.\n\nPolitics\nEach country has a diplomacy score (rating) which represents its political influence. Players can use their countries diplomats to do such things as: convince a future allies to join the war faster; delay a future enemy from declaring war and even try to overthrow a future enemies government.\n\nFinal thoughts\nTime of Wrath is a solid fun strategic game that allows people to control one or more European powers during world war 2. Some may be asking; with Strategic War in Europe just released last week did they really need to release Time of Wrath now? I am not going to lie to you and say they are radically different and if you have one you need the other. At their core both games are very similar, but target to different markets.\n\nStrategic war in Europe is a quick simple to play game that can be completed in a few play seasons. The addition of steam achievements also gives the game a more casual feel\n\nTime of Wrath with its bigger maps, smaller unit sizes gives the player a few more tactical options. The increased size of enemy counties means players must be more careful where they commit troops; since it will take much more time to move from one front to the other. There are no steam achievements, and the developers did not include the real unit photos in the info panel (Like SWE).\n\nSo while owners of SWE can hold off picking this one up, I would recommend people who do not own SWE to head straight to this. Sure it is missing some bells and whistles (achievements, unit photos) but those of us who enjoy this type of game do not play for those kind of things.","June 7, 2014","true","6.6"," 64 of 84 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","64","84","0","4"

I do actually enjoy playing it, but only because it is so utterly broken with how the ai in this game acts it's just absolutely hilarious.\nSeriously, you are going to find so many things wrong with the ai but keep coming back just so you can laugh at how incompetent it is.\n\nThe combat itself is decent all round; It isn't like any of those overly-complex ones where you need to look at a damn spreadsheet to figure out if an attack is a good idea or not. If your land units have higher strength and has favourable terrain to attack to/defend from, things will go pretty much as you'd expect. Just use common sense in that regard. The navy works by ordering a fleet to a specific sea region then forgetting about it, and that's fine. I will say that you shouldn't bother with using the airforce to attack ground units unless it's clear weather and the enemy are on open terrain. I have found that strategic bombers make a pretty potent anti-navy force, though.\n\nAnyway, here's a rundown on some of the downright sad things the ai does in this game:\n\n-Have france move units out of the french-german Maginot-Line forts, sometimes making it unnessesary to go through belgium at all.\n-AI navies don't seem to understand the concept of going back to port for repairs, and will gladly sit in the same sea region and get destroyed (I was able to wipe out Britians entire navy due to this)\n-Italy doesn't even try to garrison Albania with troops for the future war with Greece, and declare war anyway, promptly getting Albania occupied by the Greeks a turn or two later\n-USSR will attack Finland in the Winter War, then not bother to actually go beyond the territories it's supposed to take to force the peace treaty if it decides it wants all of Finland, resulting in a stack of Soviet troops sitting in the middle of Finland, doing nothing.\n-Germany sometimes declare war on the Soviets in the middle of WINTER.\n-I saw a large stack of German and Soviet troops opposite sides of the baltic sea, just sitting there doing nothing. It took a while to realize that they were trying to attack eachother, but couldn't move through the sea zone to do so, so they sat there.\n-Hungary and Romania went to war once, and then both got the event to join me (Germany). They did so, but because they were at war, I got involved in the war also, so ended up at war with both of them.\n-Invaded Italy as the US and took all their victory points. The peace treaty had Italy surrender the rest of their unnocuppied themselves to the SOVIETS. So I now had Russian territory in Milan that I couldn't go through to get to German-Austria, so I had been effectively cut off from them until the Germans took the Russian territory themselves.\n\nAlso, it becomes really obvious that the AI is given a lot more production points to buy units then you do. Only way to explain how they can afford to place "blobs" of unit counters in random places on the map, yet still have enough counters left over to wage war on you every chance it gets. Granted, that's probably because the AI would be a pushover if it had an ounce of fairness imposed on them.\n\nOverall, you should totally buy this game just so you can get a good laugh at how stupid the AI in games can get. If you can play this game with other people, though, I would recommend it for that as it does look like it would play out well as a multiplayer game.\n","September 11, 2014","false","56.0"," 39 of 48 people (81%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","81","39","48","7","0"

I can say I havve probably played close to 20 hours though. I am not one to write reviews but I thought I would for ToW.\nFIrst of all let me say I LOVE this game.  I have been forever a fan of Strategic Level WWII games. AH's Third Reich, SPI's War in the West/War in the East/ War in Europe, ADG's World in FLames, and my favorite......TSR/SPI's WWII. Of all these games, ToW reminds me most of TSR's WWII. Although in TSR's version, there are only 8 hexes from Minsk to Moscow, in ToW there are 32, so the playin field is much bigger and it feels more tactical and realistic. It is this large map that allowed me to change my mind about the stacking limit of one unit. The AI isnt all that smart, but I have seen a lot worse. This game was MADE to play PBEM, I think....something you couldnt do with TSR's WWII.\nI ran thru the tutorial which didnt teach me all that much, and then I thought I would try playing Italy as it is a smaller yet major nation that would allow me to use naval, air, armor tacttics, etc. I started in 1939 and decided against starting there so I jumped in with the Barbarossa start date playing nothing but Italy. I had to learn some fundamentals the hard way about sea transport, strategic moving, supply convoys and rebasing aircraft, but I can say I have had a lot of fun. About 10 turns into the game, I set Finland as a human player as well, and even THAT has been fun. I havent tried this game PBEM yet but I would love to, as I think you could probly convert AI nations to Player nations along the way, so that as minors, i.e. the Balkan States, entered the war, the Axis player could pick them up....or maybe even add players as the war progresses? Anyone know the answer to this?\nIf you are looking for a WWII game for both western and eastern fronts with the detail of Gary Grigsby's War in the East....this game aint it. But it is a lot of fun to play and moves along a WHOLE lot faster.\nAnyway, I heartily recommend this game if you like this genre at a strategic level.  8^D","June 22, 2014","true","153.0"," 30 of 43 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","30","43","0","2"

It's a pretty excellent game for the money.  I started my serious wargaming phase (after some failed attempts at panzer general) with Hearts of Iron III.  I found that I loved organizing and arrangin the units, but once combat started I hated the game since all you did was watch your massive creation fail miserably and have to start over again.  I then bought Unity of Command, which is by far my favorite war game, and sunk many hours into that.  When this game went on sale for 2 dollars, I thoguht, why not?  i was initially turned off by the cheesy graphics and the cheap look of it and thought it would be shovelware, boy was I wrong.\n\nThe biggest strength of this game is that it basically bridges the gap between "operational level" games like Unity of Command, and grand stategy like Hearts of Iron.  You have complete control over the entire fronts of your war, as well as some control over politics and production, but the latter two are very streamlined to focus on combat.  The one downside to this is some railroading the game does to you, preventing the infinite amount of "what if" scenerios of Hearts of Iron.  Far from the weekend college course learning curve of many of the paradox games, this game can be learned in about 30 mins even if you are a complete newbie, which is honestly what i still consider myself.  The tutorial goes over the basics of combat and management, but I'd reccomend taking a peep at the manual, which is very well indexed.  Overall combat is as simple as selecting a unit and moving it into an enemy hex, you can aslo conduct multi-pronged assaults in a three click process.  Air strikes are as simpel as clicking on the air unit, and clicking what type of strike you would like and then choosing your target.  The fact that everything can be done in 1-3 quick clicks makes this game such a joy to play.\n\nThe joy in this game is in the micromanagement of units and battles on a large scale map over the period of an entire war.  if you liked that aspect of hearts of iron but hated everything else, this is the game for you. The units in this game are mostly divisions and corps, allowing much more tactical options and more control over the battlefield. Everything you need to know about land and air combat is displayed on the sidebar, meaning you don't have to look up anything before initiating combat.   It makes micro-management fun and easy.\n\nAlso in my experience this game is extremely well optomized, zooming in and out on the map is smooth and flawless, and I've yet to have a single crash, for a game that literally has the entire european theatre in division sized units, it runs very well.\n\nAlso the cheesy graphics I mentioned? totally customizable, there are quite a few different skins for both units and maps that come with the game, and you can download more user made ones from various forums.  I opt for this look,\nhttp://i.imgur.com/BizDOBf.jpg\n\nit makes me feel like a general with an old worn paper map. i love that!\n\nThe biggest downside is the naval combat, it's awful.  There is a seperate screen for naval combat in which you move your fleets to various different hubs, then do battle with enemy fleets.  The fact that it's seperate from the rest of the game can make it very confusing, and it's really easy to accidentily move your fleet to the wrong hub, and pay a heavy price for doing so. Another downside is that I found terrain doesn't have as much as an effect as it should, I have launched attacks across rivers and not suffered very heavy losses.   Finally the AI can be very dumb and historically inaccurate, one thing I noticed was that french troops actually leave their heavily fortified maginot line positions to attack your border units, and try to invade Germany! this might look indimidating to the non historically savvy gamer but to anyone with a basic knowledge of WW2 history this is enormously stupid.  The polish units so far have behaved in a historically accurate manor, trading land for time and crumpling under the mighty armor of the Wermacht.  I haven't played much further than 1940 so I can't say much more, but the AI could definitely use an update.\n\nSeeing that wargames can cost as much as 90 dollars, and even smaller scale wargames like panzer corp are 20 dollars (plus loads of DLC), It's easy to see why a full theatre war game for 10 bucks might seem too good to be true, but it's not.  This is a very solid game that's well worth the money and does a lot of things very very well, even if it's a bit rough around the edges.","October 27, 2014","true","10.3"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","12","18","0","0"

I paid $2.50 on steam and i still feel ripped off. THERE IS NO MANUAL AVAILABLE.  You wanna use diplomacy ? Tough beans, no manual means you can't find out how. I checked company website and others. non-existent or dead links. Now i know why the company is named Wasteland.","August 4, 2014","false","1.1"," 17 of 38 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","17","38","3","0"

Once you find the right icons it's very nice. I'm an old time board game, Avalon Hill and SPI (etc) and I love this game. Started on the first campaign and am up to Jan 42.\n\nIt's just fun and engrossing.","April 6","true","802.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
