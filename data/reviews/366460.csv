Retro.  Auto-runner platformer.  Nice music.\n\nYou have been trapped in a dungeon and have to escape.  Once you start each level it runs automatically and you just have to time your jumps.  Sound easy?  Um, yeah, it's not.  Especially with spikes, fireballs, acid, bounce pads, small platforms, and who knows what else in the levels I haven't gotten to yet.\n\nSo it's not a traditional platformer where you have total control of your dude.  In this game you can only jump.  Also, each level is separate.  It's not like a huge ongoing maze.  There are no enemies (at least not yet) and you don't have any weapons.\n\nThis game surprised me.  Normally I don't like hard platformers, but with this one I don't have to control the movement of my dude, I just have to time the jumps.  So it takes out part of the platforming headache for me.\n\nGraphics are retro-inspired pixel, which is something that I love dearly.\n\nMusic is very nice.  And each time you die the music just continues, it doesn't stop and start each time you start the level.\n\nI don't know how long the game is yet.  But I've seen enough to give my approval.  Plus, it's cheap!\n","May 25, 2015","true","0.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"

It is incredibly rigorous and challenging. The levels can be frustrating at first, but after you grasp the location and understand the timing on the jumps the game gets a little easier. My first run took me about an hour and over 350 deaths to get it done. Overall, this game is not for the faint of heart, it takes time and patience but in the end the feel is rewarding.","May 13, 2015","true","2.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

Its hard, but not the hardest platformer I've played (Dustforce is way harder). My only con is that it was a bit short. My first time though gameplay was 37 mins with 173 deaths. But for only $3 it is definitely worth it. I like the bounce off the wall gameplay mechanic. The later levels introduce other objects to interact with such as disappearing blocks. It would be cool to see even more elements like these.","June 4, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
