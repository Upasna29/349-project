The unassuming and colorful visuals are intended not to delight, but to give you a false sense of security; to draw you in before transporting you to the nightmarish world of its reality. It's intentionally unsettling, and unique in how it manages to get under your skin while never assuming anything is wrong, which is what I find so remarkable about it.\n\nThe hook to Eversion is everting the world, similar to swapping dimensions, which causes the environment to change properties or even disappear. It's a simple mechanic that allows for some clever lever designs, but it is also where the game becomes very, very creepy. The deeper you go through the layers of everting, the more twisted the backgrounds become and the more deranged the music gets. The disclaimer at the start should tell you all you need to know: "this game is not suitable for children or those with a nervous demeanor."\n\nAlthough it lacks the nuance of something like Braid, Eversion similarly uses video game cliches as the foundation of the experience, relying on your expectations to carry the premise as it warps the familiar into something all its own. In this developer Zaratustra Productions is mostly successful, with my only complaint being I wish there was more here. With the exception of a few odd secrets, you can complete and collect everything in around two hours (those disinclined to gather all the gems should expect half or less than that). Even with its low base price, it feels a little too much for what you get.\n\nAside from the price, Eversion is something I think is worth your time. It completely surprised me in its execution, leaving me chilled and a little disturbed, but impressed nonetheless. If you are looking for something off the beaten path, Eversion is one game that will absolutely deliver. It doesn't last long, but this strange journey is undoubtedly one worth taking, provided you are prepared for the potentially terrifying.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","December 2, 2013","true","2.5"," 81 of 92 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","81","92","0","3"

And if you want those gems? Good luck getting them all, will require some thought and figuring out where all the Evert points are in levels to get some (namely levels 5 and 7.) A couple of the hidden achievements are equally as hard (I have to stand where on which layer for a letter?!)\n\nThe graphics are cute and horrifying on layers 6 and 7 but namely 8. -8 is such a scary layer and the music does not help! The soundtrack is really nice as well  and you need your volume up to hear -7, it's heartbeats and at that, very faint heart beats which will make most players think layer 7 has NO soundtrack to it.\n\nThe endings were just lovely, 3 endings, 1 of them is hidden and very hard to get. Are you the monster, is she a monster, are you stones, or is this all a metaphor for a atomic bomb? Hue hue hue, by the way "Metaphor for a Atomic Bomb" is an achievement and a shoutout to Braid. :)\n\nLots of spoilers in my review but overall, good game and the price is about right. I avoided picking it up for a long time because it looked to be all lollipops and rainbows, glad to see I wasn't entirely wrong there. Discount or full price, worth picking up and playing if you enjoy games that mess with your mind a bit.","November 13, 2014","true","2.7"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","90","37","41","14","2"

Do not let the kids near this despite Zee Tee's cuteness and happy flowers on the store page. The simple premise in this short platform puzzler is about our brave adventurer Zee Tee rescuing the lovely Princess. It has easy controls with arrow keys and up or Z for jump which can be configured to your preference and full screen mode.\n\nNow if this was the sum of its parts I would not be recommending this game. It is not really a spoiler to say that this is not the whole story. The strength of this title is drawing on the music and nightmarish imagery to invoke a feeling of disturbing unsettlement and confusion. This is down to the juxtaposition of cute 16 bit style and the more darker images as the game progresses .It does not hold your hand in explaining anything.\n\nRegardless if you are familiar with the source material or not this is ambiguous enough for you to draw your own personal theories.  After playing this you will sit and ask yourself "What did that all mean?"if you are a more philosophical thinker. Or you might think "Meh".\n\nThis game is tagged as horror, in the sense that this is atmospheric but there are jumpy moments. Replayability is encouraged and I  highly recommend that you collect all the gems to unlock more content and get all the achievements. The puzzle aspect for the most part are not frustrating but there are some tougher levels with spots that are easy to miss and some backtracking.\n\nThere is a freeware version of this game but I think you should buy the HD Version on Steam as this  has superior artwork, further options and finally Zaratustra Productions did a great job with this game. In conclusion this game, for better or worse should be experienced. If it is in your library already give it a play one day. If you don't own it is not that expensive or you could wait for a coupon or a sale if you are hesitant.","February 11","true","19.7"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","28","31","2","1"

No matter how much it will drive you nuts you’ll keep going just to not let it beat you.\n\nYou play as a flower looking character in a 2D side-scroller like Super Mario Bros from the old school days. Hit once you die but it doesn’t really matter since you have unlimited lives and checkpoints through each level to help you along. While going through each level you are trying to collect a certain amount of jewels that will help you discover a secret in the end.\n\nControls are pretty fluid and easy since you only move side to side and jump. There’s also a little gameplay element called evert which will change up the level design when done. This is needed to find every jewel you need and to get to the end of the levels. Doing this will also sometimes add more of a challenge as the environment seems to become more violent.\n\nEversion can be beaten in say an hour or less depending on your platforming skills and frustration levels. I spent 3 hours in the game just to find every jewel and try to complete the secret stage which I couldn’t beat. It’s a well-made game and a great challenge for anyone that may be up for it especially at the low price of $5 and can be found at a lot less then that during sales.\n\nBear Rating: 10/10","February 18, 2014","true","3.4"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","4"

You have enemies and an end of a level to reach, but in order to do so you must overcome obstacles. This could be a plant in your way or objects that need to be made solid. You do this by finding the Eversion, a dimensional changing point that warps everything on the level. That plant will become a weed that you can walk through, etc. Finding the correct order and where they're located is the main challenge of the game. But the deeper into the Eversions you go, the harder enemies become and the more environmental challenges you must face. It's quite fun!\n\nThe game can be completely beaten with 100% achievements in a couple of hours. That includes bonus levels. While it was originally freeware (that version is still available I think) and bundled, I don't think that devalues this game in the slightest. The game also supports a level editor which has to be downloaded separately.\n\nIn summary, it's a short, simple, fun game that has a charming presentation and solid gameplay mechanics. Anyone that liked Mario will find plenty to enjoy here. It also has cards now!

Also, respawns are fast, lives are infinite, and checkpoints are conveniently placed.\nThe puzzles are easy to figure out. They don't require pen & paper or anything, just a few clever uses of the game mechanics.\nThe game is quite short, as it should be.

One of the music tracks sounds better but the first main stage theme (which, granted, is all but forgotten a few levels in) was completely redone and butchered in the process. If you want to use the Steam overlay, you have to turn on a wonky OpenGL renderer that inflicts the game with AWFUL screen tearing and input lag.\n\nThe freeware version still exists and is still a fun brief diversion.

You play as Zee-Tee the Astrik (*), who is on a quest to save Princess Nehema, who has been captured by things that look a lot like Goombas. Along the way, Zee-Tee can evert to different "layers" of the world by pressing SPACE in certain areas, Things are quite different in each eversion layer, so everting is often required to progress.\n\nAlong the way, Zee-Tee can challenge himself by trying to collect all 240 gems, which will often require backtracking at certain eversion layers. Thankfully, your gems save even if you quit the level or die within, which is great for some of the harder levels.\n\nThe only real complaint I have about this game is how short it is. The game can easily be 100%ed in an hour, but if it is your first time playing, it'll probably take 2 hours or so to collect all of the gems and rescue the Princess.\n\nAll in all, Eversion is a very interesting platformer that is worth taking a look at. If you want to try the game out before you spend 5 dollars on it, the creator has a freeware version on his website. It doesn't have achievements and it's missing a handful of time attack levels, but it should get you used to the game.","October 8, 2014","true","12.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

You try to save the princess and that's pretty much it, but after the first few stages the game takes a massive detour and goes from cute to straight up terrifying.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much the same stuff like in SMB. You can jump on enemies and break blocks, but the game has a twist. There are Eversion points which turn the world into something more sinister. It also helps you pass through bushes which rot with each eversion. The controls however are kind of rough so it get's quite tough to finish some of the stages.\n\nThe art style is great, and really helps build tension which each eversion you enter as the game progressively get's more creepy as the levels go on.\n\nBut the soundtrack is my main gripe with the game. It ruins everything and not to mention the later levels are kinda of tough so the soundtrack get's tiresome.\n\nThe game took me 40 minutes to finish, but there are multiple endings to get so that extends the replay value.\n\nOverall I though Eversion was interesting, but not full price interesting. Even though it's cheap, I think waiting for a sale is a better choice.\n\nPros:\n+Creepy atmosphere\n+Great Art Style\n+Multiple Endings\n\nCons:\n-Terrible soundtrack\n-Rough Controls\n\nFinal Rating:\n7/10\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!\n","May 15","true","1.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

In Eversion you find access points throughout the levels where you can evert, altering the entire state of the level (seasons, if you will).  Each version of the level has its own unique properties and you may need to shift many times to find secrets, get to all the gems, overcome obstacles or complete the level.  While it's nowhere near anything like Braid, it can make you think but is mostly common sense and trial and error.  You won't get frustrated or have to strain your brain much.\n\nMultiple endings, achievements and plays great with a gamepad.

Sound familiar, well it should it’s essentially Mario. Unlike Mario where the levels, albeit fun, offer little in the realm of puzzling the game Eversion does. Eversion allows you to drift between realms by hitting eversion points where you can essentially shift the environment. This changes your impact on the world around you. And the enemies the world presents.\n\nThe Ambience:\nThis is by no means a children’s game despite the colorful allure the steam snap shots show. For More Information read the following sentence, beware some would say this is a spoiler –  The game presents a rather dismal idea about how bleak the world can really be. Entering emersions converts the game slowly to a more depressing state until the point of complete madness.\n\nResults:\nEversion is a game everyone should experience and enjoy. I highly recommend this game, although only if you can get it on sale for 75% or more off. I personally 100% completed this game, but if you just play through the game without doing 100% you can beat the game in less than thirty minutes. In my opinion 30 minutes is not worth $4.99.\n\nPros:\n+Fun atmosphere and great level design\n+Levels have puzzles within them or require you to solve puzzles to proceed\n+Great character control\n+Interesting enemies\n+Ability to change the levels based on the eversion you are in\n+Multiple Endings\n+Not as easy as it looks, but not too difficult\n+Secret level\n+Fun music\n\nCons:\n-Really short game\n-Game got corrupted after completing the map editing achievement and had to wipe my save (lucky the games only an hour long)\n-Achievements are not all listed so you don’t know exactly what to do\n-Full screen is not actually 1080p, causing windows on my other monitor to shift to the right of the screen.

It had technically been spoiled for me, too, but I only knew that the game was "different." That, despite the cutesy screenshots, there was more to it.\n\nThat's definitely true. I don't know if I'd necessarily call Eversion an outstanding game. It is very, very simple; even more simple than the games it is clearly trying to reference. But it's the hook that makes it interesting, and in spite of its simplicity, Eversion works within its mechanics extremely well. If you do end up playing this game, don't just finish it once and then move on -- for as short and as basic as it is, you really need to get a full, 100% clear to truly appreciate it.\n\nAnd appreciate it I did. What Eversion lacks in complexity, fidelity, and length, it more than makes up for in everything else. It's definitely worth checking out.","March 7","true","2.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's an interesting short game with an inspired premise and fantastic soundtrack, but it's been available free for about five years now, and the Steam version doesn't do enough to warrant a purchase over just playing the free version. It does have achievements and trading cards, both of which are pluses, but the game itself is still just a short novelty, albeit an interesting one. Full 360 controller support is missing, something that really isn't acceptable in a commercial platformer, and while the game has a level editor, it doesn't come packed in with the Steam version for no explicable reason. The only real reason to pick this up is if you played the free version and want to support the developer, which is admittedly why I bought it when a coupon came my way.\n\nI like eversion's style, it appeals to me a lot, and I loved it when I first played it, but I wish that the Steam release had at least gotten some basic additions like another set of levels to play through, full controller support, and having the level editor included, or even better having Steam Workshop support for custom levels. If you're paying for the game, you're going to be disappointed, and if you're paying to support the dev then why are you reading reviews. I like this one too much to thumbs down it, but the paid version does way too little to warrant any enthusiasm.\n\nAlso fair warning it's pretty damn hard, especially if you collect all the gems, though given the short length that's kind of a plus in my book.","May 10, 2015","true","1.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Even though Eversion is very hard to nail down with any adjective, it is very clear that pretentious isn't one of them.

Lovecraft quote, the game soon becomes much darker.\n\nThe core mechanic of Eversion is your ability to swap between layers, or words, and the deeper you go the stranger and darker the the world around you becomes, the actual gameplay is fairly simple and though it does get challenging later on, it never gets to Super Meat Boy levels of frustration.\n\nTo give a bit of insight this game has eight levels, you can get every ending and achievement in this game in about two hours, however despite what little there is here, it has charm to it, with the unsettling level and enemy design and tight controls it is fun for how long it lasts, after you complete the game a Time Attack mode opens as well, giving you a bit more replay value.\n\nNote that Eversion is free to download on the creators website, the version you pay for here has more detailed artwork and the aforementioned Time Attack, if you are interested in the game and want to check it out I encourage you to try the free version, but either way this game is well worth paying for, even just to show friends and watch them freak out as the game grows darker.","April 10, 2014","true","2.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bokxie/recommended/33680/","Bokxie","Bokxie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bokxie/","513 products in account","Let me get straight to the point first: This is not a terrible game. Maybe not even bad. In my opinion, it is just not worth the money.\n\nEversion is an Indie platformer which makes me scratch my head when comparing it to the original Super Mario, but only with a flower as protagonist. Of course, this game is a stand alone title, so it has some mechanics on it's own. The most recognizable one is Dimension Shifting. Like it says, you switch between different dimensions which gives the same level a different layout and enemies. With each layer, the level gets more difficult.\n\nDon't get scared though, as this game is hilariously easy. You don't have any lives, so if you were to fall in a bottomless pit or get hit by an enemy, you start at a certain checkpoint. You could compare it to Rayman Origins, but simplified. Besides, it only took me 2 hours to get all achievements, endings and collectables. And I even took my time. But this is of course personal preference as some people prefer short games, which I can clearly understand.\n\nDimension Shifting itself is a fun mechanic at first, but it gets boring really fast. And that's a shame because it is the main gimmick of the game. If you're interested in puzzles, you might see some light here.\n\nThe game only has 8 worlds, which can be completed in a laughably short time. Well, most of them anyways. By doing that you will miss all the collectibles but it still shouldn't be ignored.\n\nThe story is ignorable, the music forgetable and the graphics are, while fitting this game, just average. Remember, this is not a bad game but it's just not worth the money. If you are however able to get it on sale or in any other way, give it a go! You might see something in this game I don't.","June 7, 2014","false","2.3"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

But this game is far more than a clone. I also highly advise you take the warning on the title screen seriously.\n\nThe story of Eversion starts off very simple with the save-the-princess trope, our little flower hero Zee Tee is tasked with the job of rummaging through the lands to reunite with the Princess. Along the way you'll fight goomba-like enemies that are barely threatening. The main selling point of this game is the Eversion feature, in each level there are points where the background changes along with the music slightly, if you press the evert button in these areas the stage will evert, this changes objects in the stages. For example, if you evert in one stage you can walk on the clouds. This makes way for very creative puzzles that test your platforming skills. But this isn't the main reason the game is infamous, as you evert the stages they start to degenerate, I don't want to ruin the experience but as you start to evert the layers in the later levels you'll realize this game has combined 3 genres. Platforming, puzzle, and horror. As far as music goes, the game has some very delightful chip-tune tracks, which then slowly start to change as you evert. The last track is just a plain heartbeat.\n\nAll in all, the game has little over 1 hour of playtime, it's a fun time waster with VERY good plot twists indeed. I'd suggest playing it at night with a friend who has no idea what the game's about.","March 23, 2014","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In it, you play a little flower guy named "Zee Tee", on a quest to find the princess. Using Zee Tee's "evert" technique, you can change the world, making clouds into solid platforms or allowing shrubs to be passed by. You'll need to make good use of it if you want to find your princess, but you'll need to make expert use of it if you want to find all the gems and win her heart! Although a little short, the game does include a time trial mode and at least one reason to re-explore the levels, in the form of a tip of the hat to Braid. At $5 for a few hours of quality content, I feel it's worth it. At $2.50 during a sale, I'd say you're doing yourself a disservice by not giving it a shot.","December 5, 2012","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It just seemed such an innocuous and cute little platformer in the beginning that reminded me of Mario on LSD with the bright and colourful atmosphere. Deceivingly easy too. However, that quickly changed as I progressed through the levels which got surprisingly harder with every new layer of dimension being added to my game. Not only does the theme change to a more darker and threatening ambience, but it also modifies the environment and the difficulty with it. Clouds materialise then disappear, enemies become slower, then faster, and even your innocent little flower from layer 1 will soon become a thorny bush that will make you blow up by touching it.\n\nI found the themes to be really creepy. I think that is what made the biggest impression on me, the music that gradually became more chaotic, the darker colour palettes, the vast amounts of hemoglobin, the hands, etc... Level 6 just gets your adrenaline going, though after the 10th death you kinda start getting used to it. I'm not that good at platformers, yet I wanted to 100% this one. So it did take me a couple hours to get everything, and it was indeed a nice challenge without being SMB-"suicidal", as Monukai (http://steamcommunity.com/id/Monukai/recommended/33680/) put it.\n\nThe only thing I'd criticise this game for would be its short length (that's what she said). Also, I felt that the first few dimensions were a bit underrepresented in the later levels. Basically what I'm saying is, eversion certainly has a LOT of potential. I could imagine trickier and more complex levels being made with a bit of creativity which I unfortunately don't have.\n\nAnyhow, I fully endorse the thought that eversion is well worth the few quid (though mine was a bundle buy #cheapskate). I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel of this 'cute' little gem, so please, anyone?","June 17, 2013","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

The music with FM synthesis creates the atmospheres of the video games from 1980s and early 1990s. What makes the music more unique is the use of absurd melodies and the unusual combinations of different timbres, and that absolutely makes the later parts of this game horrible, and somehow odd. Good job Miroslav Malesevic, you have inspired me!\nFor me, this game is like a hommage to, yet a parody of the Super Mario Bros series. The theme of 'a hero beats numerous monsters and finally saved his heroine' is embodied in this game. However, don't you think this theme is somehow old-fashioned? Wait, after finishing the whole game, you will find out the reason why this game deviates from that hackneyed theme, and why I said this game is a parody.\nThis is a great game with fantastic BGM and unusual atmospheres and endings.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smileybarry/recommended/33680/","smileybarry","Smiley","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smileybarry/","374 products in account","Eversion is a platformer that takes cues from some older, more recognised platformers — like Mario. It looks like a cute little retro game, where you play a small flower-like creature out to rescue a princess. You collect gems, stomp enemies, and reach the flag. However, in reality, it’s ”cute” and familiar only to deceive the player.\n\nOne unique feature — and the main idea of this game — is “eversion”. In specific, small, invisible “hotspots” in the game (that you can reach) you can switch to another sort-of parallel reality, where some rules might be different. For example, clouds can be walked on in some realities, and in others, shrubs become trees that block your path.\n\nThe game’s called “Eversion” for a reason: as you progress through the game, it starts “turning inside out”, revealing the hell inside this beautiful, peaceful world. You start off in a cute dreamy land, collecting gems and passing by (or stomping) happy, innocent “enemies” that skip around. Soon enough, these enemies turn worse and your surroundings change. At some point, the game even starts lying to the player and occasionally tries to discourage the player from continuing, while at the same time breaking the fourth wall.\n\nEversion is rather short (less than an hour, possibly more to max it out), but it’s a great experience that anyone should play. It challenges game design standards and does a lot of things completely different compared to standard games, even indie ones.","January 4, 2014","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Using this skill is necessary to beat the different stages, and abusing it is the only way to actually gather all the hidden gems. Makes for some interesting puzzles, though there is a fair amount of running back and forth. Also as the layers shift there is a visible degradation in the overall mood - starting at happy-go-lucky with layer one and ending at disturbed and insane. Naturally, the BGM changes along with the layers, and the different variations do reflect the mood of each layer nicely.\n\nThe game's short so there's not much I can say about the "story" without spoiling the fun, though here's a nice little something to pique your interest (potential spoiler) -- Braid references (and not the insignificant kind)! This really made me smile and nod in approval.\n\nOf downsides I found only one that bugged me -- poor controller support. My x360 controller was not recognised at all, had to plug in my old usb gamepad. And even then the ESC key (back to menu) cannot be mapped to the pad via in-game settings.\n\nOverall, short (1-2 hours), fun, and a wee bit challenging to clear everything.","February 27, 2014","true","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

What I got was a rather advanced platformer with a macabre theme.\n\nI'm not very good at platformers, so I am not the best judge about their difficulty. But there are some things in this game that make it difficult. In addition to some other techniques, this game requires timed jumping, timed levels, and jumping off of enemies. All of these are well known techniques, but they are still difficult. There are no new mechanics to add difficulty, so it is just the difficulty of basic platforming raised to a rather high level.\n\nI was also interested in the game because it had the 'Lovecraftian' tag. I was expecting some story between the different levels. There was no story. Instead of being Lovecraftian, I would call it just macabre until possibly the very end.

I imagine anyone buying it just wanted it because it was cheap and looked cute.\n\nHow wrong you are.\n\nStory\nSomething about the princess being taken is written on the store page. You won't really see much story once in the game, except for the ending.\n\nPresentation\nCute graphics here, they are what drew me in to purchasing this game. Little did I know that would soon change to a nightmarish landscape rather quickly. While they are rather basic and obviously inspired by classic games, they still look nice.\n\nThe isn't a lot of music in the game, but it fits the setting. Simple sound effects that do the job as well. Not really much to say about them.\n\nControls\nAs the controls are rather simple, they work well on keyboard, but gamepads also have support if you prefer those. Movement, jumping, the Eversion ability (which shall be detailed below) and a pause button. You could play this with a NES clone controller if you own one.\n\nGameplay\nRun, jump, bounce off enemy heads, collect the gems and reach the end of the level.  Sounds like any NES era platformer game, right? Well, since the game opens up with a Lovecraft quote, there is obviously going to be something creepy lurking in the shadows. And that is where the Eversion ability comes in. In each level, there are locations where the walls between realities are weak. If you can find them, you can shift to another reality, often darker than the one you were already in. This will have an effect on both the landscape and enemies. That bush will wither and die, only to be replaced by deadly vines. Enemies may lose the will to live, just standing there for you to end its life, or it may get faster and more dangerous. Switching realities is needed to get all the gems through the levels, and sometimes even to progress forward through what would otherwise block movement.\n\nLifespan\nThis game is short. Including the final level which requires you to find all the gems, you are unlikely to spend more than an hour or two doing the main game, including the different endings. Once you have seen the true ending, you do unlock a time attack mode with leader boards, which can add to the time spent on the game. There is also a level editor available, though I haven't played around with any of the community content myself.\n\nWhile not a bad game, the short game length alone is a good enough reason to only get on sale or with a Steam discount coupon.\n\n6 / 10","March 4, 2014","true","2.2"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","15","29","0","4"

It's important to note some things before coming in. First of all, this version of Eversion is 16 bit, unlike the original 8 bit version you can download for free on the internet. This version also has some bonus content, and extra unlockables, but; I'll cover them as we go.\n\nEversion for what it is, is a very short game; it's got 7 stages, and a secret unlockable 8th stage. In order to unlock the 8th stage, you have to collect 240 jewels scattered among the stages. Why are you doing this? Because the main character needs to rescue a princess. Yeah, Eversion's not one for story; and it doesn't need it at all. But it is interesting to note; that Eversion is based off the writings of H.P. Lovecraft.\n\nThat of course means, that the game is scary.. But not "Jumpscare in your face" scary like so many games attempt. Eversion is scary because the entire tone of the game is dictated by the signature ability; Eversion. When you use it, the world around you changes; and that's the key gameplay element. There are 8 layers of Eversion that you cycle through as the game progresses, and each layer has it's own rules; so the majority of the game is learning how each layer affects your platforming. Aside from this feature; the game plays as a Mario style collectathon with you gathering 240 jewels.\n\nThere are 3 Unlockable endings, and after unlocking the "True" ending, you unlock Time Attack which allows you to race the scoreboard to see who can beat the game the fastest. The Time Attack mode also includes the original Stages 4 and 8, as the HD remake made new versions of those stages to replace the old ones. There's also hidden letters that spell out "EVERSION" for a hidden Achievement for those who like to 100% games.\n\nHowever, one thing I will warn players of, is Eversion gets hard later on. Now, difficulty in games is a good thing, and a game should gradually get harder; but the issue is, Eversion starts off too easy. The first 3 stages are pushovers, with the only challenging part being figuring out how to collect the jewels in them. Once you hit stage 4 however; the game pulls no punchs from here onward. The rest of the game can be a spiraling rage cycle of pure frustration.\n\n-- The Good --\n+ Eversion is a unique gameplay mechanic.\n+ The music and atmosphere are terrific.\n+ The graphics range from bright and colorful, to grim and terrifying.\n+ Based on H.P. Lovecraft\n+ Easy to 100%.\n\n-- The Bad --\n- Huge Difficulty spike midway through the game.\n- Little to no replay value once finished.\n- Extremely short. (I got 100% in 2 hours).","January 7","true","2.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The only twist being that you have the ability to shift environments (eversions). You can shift from six different eversions: deception, erosion, desolation, apprehension, confusion and commotion. Every shift will change colors and backgrounds. The shifts will also turn bushes from leafy, to dead so you can pass through them and into deadly thorn bushes. Some enemies into stone and brick platforms into crumbling blocks. You cannot just shift on a whim, you need to find the invisible area you're supposed to stand in and then shift eversions. When you press the eversion button, if you're close enough to the correct invisible spot, you'll see a ring around it for a brief time. If you're stuck, that usually means you need to backtrack and find the invisible spot.\n\nThe gameplay is simple. Like Mario you can destroy bricks by jumping into them and make a gem appear out of blocks by jumping into special ones. Eventually, you will get to see this magical kingdom for what it is. Horrifying, dark and grim. At some point, enemies will spurt bright red blood partially obscuring the screen. Although some might boast this as a horror game, there's nothing really horrific. I was too busy laughing at the giant hands that comically shoot up from death pits. Its too bright and simple of an art style to really be horrific.\n\nThere are no power ups. Every hit is instant death, but that's okay because there are no lives. You just respawn at the start of the level or the last checkpoint. The game boasts 8 worlds, but really these worlds are just 8 levels. A world to me feels like it should be more than a level. I was able to breeze through the game in half an hour and that's even looking for invisible eversion points. At the end of each level you hop on a ground flag. There are no bosses, in fact there really only seems to be three enemy types in the game. Monkey claw, goomba and some sort of stone beetle.\n\nUpon completing the game, it just crashed back to the desktop. The only replay value is going back to collect all 240 gems to get better endings that reference better properties. Once you get a gem, it the game considers collected, even if you die on the same run, that gem will not be there. Not having any consequence of death makes things way too easy. This is a quick diversion without any challenge. The forum is full of people giving away 66% off coupons and others talking about how the game is free.","November 6, 2014","false","1.3"," 21 of 43 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","21","43","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RoberTime/recommended/33680/","RoberTime","RoberTime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RoberTime/","55 products in account","I'd like to do a Completionist-style review for this game. Because his reviews are awesome.\n\nForeword, Eversion is a quick Mario-style platformer and also a Lovecraftian game meaning the game starts out cute and bright, but as you progress through, it gets darker and darker. It also has achievements and trading card content to go with it! Eversion started out as a free online game, then implemented to Steam with HD graphics and new updated features.\n\nTHE STORY\nZee Tee, the cute protagonist of the game, looking like an orange star-shaped creature with legs, has to go out in the land and save the princess Nehema. Zee Tee is able to "Everse" to different layers of the world. Which get darker and scarier as he gets lower and lower in the layers. The other entities get dangerous and horrid as he gets lower. The game has three different endings based on what you do in the last few levels.\n\nTHE PRESENTATION\nThe game begins in the top layer, where everything is bright, colorful, and cute, just like the first few levels of a Mario game! There are flowers and blue skies. Once you cross to the first eversion layer, which is right below the top one (Not the one you started at), the first layer shows a lower saturation of visuals, and you can see several things have slowly deteriorated. In fact, if you get down into lower eversion layers, they deteriorate even more and the other creatures get more monstrous. Also blood. It's a rather disturbing game. That's why you should acknowledge the fine print at the start of the game: "not intended for children or those of a nervous disposition".\n\nTHE GAMEPLAY\nThe game has seven levels before the main ending. Each level is short and quick. Use the arrow keys to control your character, and press the Space bar to locate Eversion portals and flip through layers when at one. However in deeper layers, you won't be able to locate them, but you'll know when you're at them when the background partially changes. There are also gems in each level to collect and they are required for a secret eighth level and secret ending for 100%. The best part about the gems is they are ALL persistant meaning they remain collected when you die or quit the level. No need having to collect them again! Of course flipping through eversion layers is crucial for going through most levels and collecting gems. There is also a Time Attack mode after the secret ending and you can run through any level in the shortest about of time. It has worldwide leaderboards. I'm working on some good times now. I'm top 40 in the first level, but that's only the first level. Finally, the game has controller support, so grab your Xbox 360 controller if you have one!\n\nTHE FINAL LEVEL (SPOILERS!)\nI'll actually talk about not only the seventh level but the secret eighth level also. The seventh level is one of the few that goes through ALL the layers. You start at a deep layer where the background is red with demonic hands in the background, and no music. Collecting all the gems is tricky work as you have to go back and fourth through the level to find the eversion portals. You don't need to shift to any layer to beat the level, but when you do. You see the ending with the princess becoming a MONSTER. Game over, then the game crashes. So if you want a better ending, you must beat the secret level. At the start of the seventh level, there is a gem count. If you get ALL the gems in the game, you're able to shift to the FINAL layer where it's the DARKEST ever, with enemies regenerating over time. Beating the level with the final layer takes you to the eighth, which is the same deal, except you need to solve puzzles, locate portals, and get to the end to get the good ending. It's similar to the endless castles in SMB. You start at the lowest layer, and work your way up to the top layer to the end of the level. Then the secret ending, it was much more screwed up, as not only has the princess became a monster again, but ZEE TEE as well. WHAT A TWIST.\n\nSo that was Eversion. It's a quick game that turns cute to HORRIFYING quick. It can really unsettle you if you're not prepared. Yesterday I started playing this game, beaten the game, got all gems, got the secret ending, and got ALL achievements. It's THAT quick. However it's $5 for a game you could play for free, but you have extra features. I suggest buying it when it's on sale. Like I did! To conclude, Eversion is a fun game with a really interesting gameplay mechanic. I find it have a nice replay value with the graphics and everything. If you're not like me, it's a game to mess around with for a short time until you go tired of it, or a game you can play to waste time on. I recommend this game.

The gameplay is akin to the classic Super Mario games, and while it's mostly straightforward, the "eversion" game mechanic allows you to change the environment slightly at certain points in each level, which gives each stage more depth as it allows for some intricate puzzles and level design. Eversion's difficulty starts out quite low but rapidly accelerates into a challenging game as your progress.\n\nThe game does suffer from a couple of minor flaws. It's short - 7 levels short. However, there is a time attack mode with online highscores (with alternate versions of a couple levels), which gives the game a bit more replay value. There are also a couple areas where the hitboxes on the player make it difficult to maneuver through one-block gaps, but this only happens in a couple of areas.\n\nOverall, Eversion is a cheerful and unique experience; it's something you and everyone you know should definitely play. oh no it's coming for me PLEASE HELP[/b][/spoiler]","March 10, 2014","true","11.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The level design is great, the art really makes you feel like you're a part of this decaying façade of a world, and the music sets the tone of each "world" perfectly.\n\nThis is a perfect game for someone who enjoys horror games, but is tired of the same old jumpscares that startled them last year.","April 3, 2015","true","4.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However you can go to the Speaker on the pc to turn this lower.\n\nThe music changes on the current "Layer screen".\nYou can play this in fullscreen or window mode, It's either super small window or super zoomed view.\nYou can play this game with a xbox controller. No Rumble effect.\n\nAbout the game\nThe game is based on kids, however the game contains alot of flashing. (Switching the layer screen will cause the flash.)\n\nYou play as some sort of a Flower. Let me guess you have to rescue the flower princess or a Florist?\n\nThe game reminds me a little bit too much from Mario, The "Goomba" thingy and layout in the first level.\n\nThere are Gems in each level that you are able to grab.\nYou have unlimited Lives and there is no timer.\n\nYou can switch "Layer screens", which will allow you stand on clouds, however they can also block you now.\n\nLayer screen is changing the gameplay, Sometimes this is required to complete the level or obtain gems.\n\nThe game saves automatically the level. Even if you have not completed it. Gems will be saved aswell.\n\nIf you die or restart over for whichever reason. All gems that you have collected will be saved, even in the current level.\n\nYou can choose which level you want to play at the main menu. They will also tell how many gems you have collected and you are able to collect 240 Gems in total.\n\nThere are checkpoints, but they are hidden.\n\nIf you switch layer screen, The entire screen will be different, which means that enemies could be sleeping but also background could be hurting you. Some of the bricks can be destroyed aswell.\n\nThe difficulty is based on the "layer screen", some of these layers makes it very easy to move on and others makes it difficult. (Some of the background is able to hurt you and some will let you to pass through.\n\nThe gems only has one purpose, and that is for the final level to unlock the Secret Level to see an alternative ending.\n\nThe game is Very short but has multiple endings.\n\nOther thingsYou do not really want to use Shift-tab, because everything will get zoomed in if you play on fullscreen, If you play on windows mode everything will be tight.\n\nYou might want to put your headset or lower the volume after awhile. Not it will get annoying after awhile but may cause headaches.\n\nIf you jump on an enemy, you will be bouncing slightly higher then by using your normal jump. (exact timing)\n\nIf you have picked up a Gem, then it is automatically saved already. So this mean it is NOT required to beat the level.\nThis will save some time for the gems that you have missed in a level. Once you have got them all in a level, Press ESC and move on to the next level.\n\nSometimes it is better to kill yourself after you have obtained some Gems which was required to switch some Layer Screens. Just to save your self some "travel" time (This is mainly useful for the gems that you had to obtain in the beginning of the level and was forced to switch layers"\n\nThe Game Closes itself in the end... After you have completed it.  TWICE (like a Crash)\n\n\n\nReferencesIt has Mario Finish flag, Goomba looking enemies. and in ending aswell.. Even some achievements...\n\n-----------\n\nI will give this a 6/10","December 6, 2015","false","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I didnt really enjoy it, hoping at first for a mario type game I was dissapointed to find it didnt really have any resemblance to the italian plumber at all other than the obvious platform/style. Theres a twist to the levels... at certain points you can press the evert button which changes how clouds and stepping stones etc behave. Using this you can advance further into the 8 levels. The game is short and wont take you long to 100%. You will need to read a guide to accomplish this though as one achievement needs you to edit a level in the map editor. This is very simple though... so dont be put off. Overall its not the best game but thats not to say some wont enjoy it more than I did.

I have learned a bit more about the game, and will requalify my review.\n\nHonestly, I was wrong to think this game was hard. It's actually not challenging, just inconsistent in executing jumps at least on keyboard. Disabling the Steam Overlay helps to reduce input lag, but the game is still not tight like Super Meat Boy. Movement is fast and slippery, which makes precision more cumbersome, but it can be done. The gameplay is really basic, simple platforming with minor dimensional differences.\n\nI feel the big problem is that the game does little unique. In truth, you are paying for a minor graphical update, since the game is free online at lower graphical fidelity. For the price, this graphics package is quite underwhelming. There are several palette swaps, but the animations are only a few frames. Music is repetitive, and starts over every time you die. It all feels cheaply put together, more rusty than retro.\n\nThe game is short, dimension shifting is more for the brooding plot than for gameplay, and the ending could be reached in a few minutes. As for the plot, despite "inspiration" from Lovecraft and any kind of written material, the plot is laughable. I understand platformers are not known for story, but Braid and VVVVVV did a heck of a lot more in story along with gameplay. For a game that sells itself on "the twist", that twist just made me think that someone needs to stop playing in MS Paint. It feels antiquated, and reminds me of the shoddy romhack creepypasta stuff of Mario online. Those elements probably had a larger influence on this game than Lovecraft ever did.\n\nSo the story, gameplay, and graphics are all mediocre, doing little new. VVVVVV just seems to do everything better. Saira is a great puzzle-platformer option with probably 3 times the content, better graphics and music, and is fully free forever on Steam right now. Eversion fails to impress anymore, and feels more like a joke. The developer never bothered to capitalize letters in the few announcements made for the game, so maybe the whole thing really is a joke. Still, not worth the price, as the game never goes on sale anymore.","July 9, 2014","false","6.8"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

At 0.8 hours of playtime I've already reached the regular ending and I'm close to reaching the secret ending.

Bought this because I had a 66% off coupon and I don't think I'd pay any more than that. There's a free version of this on the internet which I would recommend instead.\n\nI hope the developers take this idea much further with a new, longer game.

It's a generic little platformer, with your generic little story, Zee Tee has to save the Princess, blah blah blah. The controls are a little clunky at times, and can ruin the game at times for sure. The gimmick are these "eversions" which take you to different dimensions (sorta) in which the rules of the game change, in one eversion you can walk through clouds, in the other they're required to complete the level/get all the gems. The gimmick does end up leading to the game's horror element, which isn't all that bad. One of the few redeeming factors of the game is the music. It gets better the farther you go into the eversion states.\n\nI give eversion a 5/10, it's an average platformer that isn't really all that special and honestly you can just play the free version.\nhttp://zarat.us/tra/eversion/","December 7, 2013","false","1.3"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Eversion was made for an H.P. Lovecraft-themed game competition and it becomes very apparent after a level or two, in which the inane becomes unnerving, and the unnerving becomes insane. This is achieved by having the player character shift through different parallel dimensions in each level, changing the scenery, enemies and making objects in the environment warp into walkable platforms or deadly hazards.\n\nAll these elements collide and you’re left scrambling around each level, slowly plunging into the deeper layers, trying to keep your cool while you solve the puzzles so you can collect every last gem and unlock the final level.\n\nThe game is of a rather short length, since its gimmick is just that, a gimmick. After travelling through the different layers and seeing how the world transforms you’ve seen all the game has to offer. Fortunately, Eversion is aware of this and will not overstay its welcome, unless you feel like editing levels or playing the time attack mode.\n\nIf you’re on the fence, I strongly recommend checking out the free version from the author’s website. The graphics are simpler and the resolution is halved, allowing the player to fill in the gaps with his imagination, making the experience more intense. And if you enjoy it and feel like doubling on the graphics quality, support the author and getting slightly more content, purchase the Steam edition.","July 19, 2014","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All is fun and good until you get into deeper, darker dimensions in which you are running through hell and avoiding obstacles left and right, from above and from below.

Eversion is at its core a puzzle platformer, and a clever one too.  You control the flower-faced hero named Zee Tee and rescue the princess, so if you've played any NES game before you already know what to do.\n\nGameplay is basically platforming but with a dimension-warping mechanic where you jump through alternate worlds.  You may have to change something in one world in order to affect the other world and then you can get to where you couldn't before.  It sounds hard at first but with a bit of practice you will eventually understand what to do.  There are collectables throughout the stages to give some replay value, though I wasn't too interested.  Things do get shaken up later with different enemies and slightly different ways to play the stage, though generally things remains the same throughout.  Of course, the other dimensions might just maybe chinge things up a bit.

You jump on enemies, collect gems and try to reach a flag at the end of each level. The hero doesn't have any special powers, and there's no power-ups to be collected either. The world is colorful, bright and playfully decorated. Sounds like a real drag, eh?\n\nNow here's the twist: by visiting certain places in each level, you make the world everse into darker and more hellish dimensions so that you can reach that famous flag at the end. Enemies gets quicker and more sinister, devil hands try to reach out from the pits to grab you, the colors shift to desolate, icy, bleak and the bushes and flowers wither and die. Oh, and there's a fog from hell chasing you, wanting to consume all in it's path.\n\nWhat makes the game great is the aestethic, and the replay value added in the achievements.

The core "eversion" concept is pretty awesome, changing everything about a level every time you go up or down a "layer." The top layer is super happy, but as you trudge deeper and deeper things get...less so. It isn't just about the visual or music changes, however; gameplay itself changes, with enemy AI changing routines, background elements changing their solidity, and some objects will turn from benign to deadly depending on what layer you're in. It all leads to some very fun and interesting puzzles.

What caught my eye first were the two tags for it:  Horror and Lovecraftian.  I'm also a  big fan of 2D, pixel graphics, platforming, retro, etc. style games.  So throw all that + those two tags together... I was sold.  I was also not disappointed.  The game starts off cute, happy, and innocent.  There are areas though that with the push of a button, things start to become more depressing.  The closer you get to the end, the more nightmarish they become.  You switch back and forth between these everts in order to collect all 240 gems scattered about the levels.  As you progress, you will need to not only master the everts, but also complete some well thought out platforming puzzles.  The "Game Over!" ending you are likely to get on your first playthrough, as well as the game basically telling you to give up if you die in the later stages, just adds to its overall appeal.  I had a blast playing through it.","September 3, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Finished it in one sitting, tempted to go back and get all completionist on it. It's a cute game with a very effective atmosphere. As others have said it's one of those better played than explained situations.\n\nI am recommending this game but I'm reluctant to because of some things that I feel should have been fixable.\n\n<CRITICISM>\n\nFirst criticism: As far as I could find there was no native controller support. Sure I could Joy2Key it or something and if I were to go back to 100% it I most certainly would do that but if you're going to charge money for a platformer in this day and age you should support at least the bare minimum of controllers.\n\nSecond criticism: If you AREN'T going to support controllers (or even if you do really) either make sure your mechanics are really smooth and satisfying or don't rely on cheap tricks like long jumps you have to make with a block above you while enemies loom ready to intercept you. That's just one example and in the greater scheme I'm saying either get creative with how you create challenge or tone it down a bit. This game was surprisingly unforgiving and frustrating and it really took away from the atmosphere after a while.\n\nIn a way it felt like it couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a Mario/Super Meat Boy style experience or whether it wanted to be a Braid style experience. I feel like it would have been a better game if it had chosen Puzzles and Atmosphere or Unforgiving Platformer and spent more time polishing whichever one they chose.\n\n</CRITICISM>\n\nWith all that said, the game wasn't long enough to get extremely mad at and was cheap enough that that didn't bother me. The atmosphere and scenery made up for the lackluster mechanics and overall it was a great way to spend a bit of time. I do recommend you pick this title up, especially if you catch it on a sale.

Eversion was made for an H.P. Lovecraft-themed game competition and it becomes very apparent after a level or two, in which the inane becomes unnerving, and the unnerving becomes insane. This is achieved by having the player character shift through different parallel dimensions in each level, changing the scenery, enemies and making objects in the environment warp into walkable platforms or deadly hazards.\n\nAll these elements collide and you’re left scrambling around each level, slowly plunging into the deeper layers, trying to keep your cool while you solve the puzzles so you can collect every last gem and unlock the final level.\n\nThe game is of a rather short length, since its gimmick is just that, a gimmick. After travelling through the different layers and seeing how the world transforms you’ve seen all the game has to offer. Fortunately, Eversion is aware of this and will not overstay its welcome, unless you feel like editing levels or playing the time attack mode.\n\nIf you’re on the fence, I strongly recommend checking out the free version from the author’s website. The graphics are simpler and the resolution is halved, allowing the player to fill in the gaps with his imagination, making the experience more intense. And if you enjoy it and feel like doubling on the graphics quality, support the author and getting slightly more content, purchase the Steam edition.","July 19, 2014","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The whole gameplay relies on a layers gimmick. You switch between them to navigate through obstacles, collect the diamonds and reach the goal. The further the layer, the weirder the surroundings and the harder the challenge.\n\nAlthough the gameplay is very fun, it's the mood that is set by each of the layers that really captures one's attention. You go from a poppy bright cheerful world into a twisted dark one. What should be pointed out is that the music plays a big role in maintaining the right feel for each of the dimensions. When it comes to the ending (well all 3 of them), it's the cherry on top of the cake.\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game to everyone who likes platformers, indie games or puzzle games but remember to keep in mind that the game lasts only for about 2 hours before you have everything unlocked.

Sounds like a real drag, eh?\n\nNow here's the twist: by visiting certain places in each level, you make the world everse into darker and more hellish dimensions so that you can reach that famous flag at the end. Enemies gets quicker and more sinister, devil hands try to reach out from the pits to grab you, the colors shift to desolate, icy, bleak and the bushes and flowers wither and die. Oh, and there's a fog from hell chasing you, wanting to consume all in it's path.\n\nWhat makes the game great is the aestethic, and the replay value added in the achievements.

There aren't a hojillion hours of replay value to be found here (although I definitely recommend going for the hidden ending), but its simple gameplay is addictive and the varied audio really adds to the ambience of each level.\n\nAnyone can pick it up and just have a go, since the controls only require four buttons. It's for this reason that a keyboard works as well as a gamepad. My only gripe is the pixel precision required to jump up through a hole that's the same width as your player character, but this action is only necessary in a few places.\n\nIf you can't justify tossing 5bux for an imaginative pixely platformer (and you can do MUCH worse than Eversion on Steam), there's a free version on Zaratustra's website.","January 21, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It plays and looks very much like Mario; you bounce around collecting things whilst killing monsters by landing on their heads. Get to the end of the game and rescue the princess. It’s all very basic stuff – or so one would think.\n\nWhat makes this game unique is that the main character has the ability to manipulate the world around him. When that happens, certain objects in the game change. Clouds solidify, making them safe to walk on. Trees become withered, allowing you to walk through them. Monsters stop moving, plants turn hazardous, rocks turn into rock monsters, and so on and so forth. There are seven different stages of world alteration, and not only does it change the graphics and objects, but also the music soundtrack as well.\n\nAs you traverse each level (there are eight in total), you experience… well… let’s just say you experience. Sorry to cut this review rather short, but saying anything else might result in unintentional spoilers.\n\nI’ll round it off by saying this; Eversion is no Spelunky. It’s no Shovel Knight, and it’s certainly no game that will last you several weeks or months. That’s Eversion’s one big drawback; it doesn’t last very long. I’ve played it for two hours, and virtually uncovered everything the game had to offer.\n\nHaving said that, I recommend Eversion to anyone mature, who want to discover something a little out of the ordinary.\n\nScore: 73/100","July 22, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Eu já conhecia Eversion por causa de seu "Tema" principal que é o Fator de descobrir que nem tudo que você vê é verdade. Zee Tee no Game consegue reverter os mundos do Reino (Fases) e passar fazendo Puzzles de [Pular/Cair/Sobreviver]. O Game tem poucas Conquistas o que ajuda ao Player de se interessar pelo Game. Os Pontos Obscuros de Eversion são sempre sua trilha sonora que faz o Player ir à um estágio de "depressão" eu acho... bom, isso depende se você tem problemas com pressão alta. Um dos pontos obscuros também são as mensagens aleatórias do Games que te só deixam o Player assustado por alguns segundos como a mensagem: "Atrás de Você, Morra e Game Over". Eversion com sua versão HD tem um preço aceitável na Steam que embora de pequeno, curto e infantil, traz uma boa experiência de Game Play e de Atmosfera pois é o que o Game mais se aprimorou nisso.

Finished it in one sitting, tempted to go back and get all completionist on it. It's a cute game with a very effective atmosphere. As others have said it's one of those better played than explained situations.\n\nI am recommending this game but I'm reluctant to because of some things that I feel should have been fixable.\n\n<CRITICISM>\n\nFirst criticism: As far as I could find there was no native controller support. Sure I could Joy2Key it or something and if I were to go back to 100% it I most certainly would do that but if you're going to charge money for a platformer in this day and age you should support at least the bare minimum of controllers.\n\nSecond criticism: If you AREN'T going to support controllers (or even if you do really) either make sure your mechanics are really smooth and satisfying or don't rely on cheap tricks like long jumps you have to make with a block above you while enemies loom ready to intercept you. That's just one example and in the greater scheme I'm saying either get creative with how you create challenge or tone it down a bit. This game was surprisingly unforgiving and frustrating and it really took away from the atmosphere after a while.\n\nIn a way it felt like it couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a Mario/Super Meat Boy style experience or whether it wanted to be a Braid style experience. I feel like it would have been a better game if it had chosen Puzzles and Atmosphere or Unforgiving Platformer and spent more time polishing whichever one they chose.\n\n</CRITICISM>\n\nWith all that said, the game wasn't long enough to get extremely mad at and was cheap enough that that didn't bother me. The atmosphere and scenery made up for the lackluster mechanics and overall it was a great way to spend a bit of time. I do recommend you pick this title up, especially if you catch it on a sale.

The gimmick for this game is the ability to “evert,” which can only be done at certain points of a level. Everting is activated simply by clicking the key assigned to do so at an evert point. When you evert you change the world around you to an alternate reality. There are 7 different realities in use (plus an 8th hidden one), though most levels only use a small number.\n\nYou need to find eversion points to change the world so that you can progress though out the stage, as it will change small things about the world that let you progress. It’s not rocket science figuring out how to use eversion to advance, as it’s all pretty straight forward.\n\nWhen you begin the game the world starts out very happy and cheery, bright colours and all that. As you descend into the later stages of eversion, the world gradually shifts darker and darker.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn’t really anything fancy. In the early levels you’ll notice it draws influence from the original Super Mario Bros. This is most notable in the first stage, as it bears a striking resemblance in how the beginning of the level looks.\n\nThe gems scattered throughout the game for you to collect don’t serve any purpose, except to unlock a secret level at the end of the game. I didn’t take the time to unlock the secret level, and after pulling it up on youtube to have a look at it, I don’t plan to either, as it doesn’t look like it’s worth the time.\n\nSo is it worth buying? Eh, only if you want a short little platformer to kill an hour (if that). There’s a free version available on the developer’s (Zaratustra Productions), though the Steam version features some minor graphical and audio updates. It’s normally $5, though it’s really not worth that price, so I’d wait for it to go on sale. I wish I could give this game a neutral rating, as it’s not good enough to really recommend, nor is it bad enough to advise against purchasing. Take your pick based on if it looks interesting to you or not.","October 11, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It plays and looks very much like Mario; you bounce around collecting things whilst killing monsters by landing on their heads. Get to the end of the game and rescue the princess. It’s all very basic stuff – or so one would think.\n\nWhat makes this game unique is that the main character has the ability to manipulate the world around him. When that happens, certain objects in the game change. Clouds solidify, making them safe to walk on. Trees become withered, allowing you to walk through them. Monsters stop moving, plants turn hazardous, rocks turn into rock monsters, and so on and so forth. There are seven different stages of world alteration, and not only does it change the graphics and objects, but also the music soundtrack as well.\n\nAs you traverse each level (there are eight in total), you experience… well… let’s just say you experience. Sorry to cut this review rather short, but saying anything else might result in unintentional spoilers.\n\nI’ll round it off by saying this; Eversion is no Spelunky. It’s no Shovel Knight, and it’s certainly no game that will last you several weeks or months. That’s Eversion’s one big drawback; it doesn’t last very long. I’ve played it for two hours, and virtually uncovered everything the game had to offer.\n\nHaving said that, I recommend Eversion to anyone mature, who want to discover something a little out of the ordinary.\n\nScore: 73/100","July 22, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Other controllers I tried required something like XPadder.\n\nGameplay: The gimmick behind this game is that your character has to switch between dimensions at "Evert" point in order to complete levels. There are a certain number of collectable gems in each level. All of them must be collected in order to get what appears to be the game's true ending.\n\nVisuals: Very basic visual design, although not to the point of coming off as amateurish.\n\nSound: Certain dimensions have pleasantly distorted remixes of tracks from earlier dimensions, but overall the music and sound design are also very basic.\n\nAmount of content: Frankly, this game is over in the blink of an eye. I spent a little over 2.5 hours with it, but that was getting 100% and cleaning up the achievements. If one is concerned about simply beating the game, I'm unsure if it would even take an hour.\n\nFinal impression: It's not worth the $5 price it normally goes at, but if it goes below $2, it might be worth picking up just to waste a bit of time.","January 15","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rebornboy/recommended/33680/","rebornboy","Reborn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rebornboy/","143 products in account","Eversion é um Game de Plataforma Rogue-Like 2D de Estilo Terror/Aventura onde você controla Zee Tee, um "Soldado" em formato de Flor que tem a missão de salvar a Princesa "que esqueci o nome" pelos mundos escondidos e explícitos de Eversion. Eu já conhecia Eversion por causa de seu "Tema" principal que é o Fator de descobrir que nem tudo que você vê é verdade. Zee Tee no Game consegue reverter os mundos do Reino (Fases) e passar fazendo Puzzles de [Pular/Cair/Sobreviver]. O Game tem poucas Conquistas o que ajuda ao Player de se interessar pelo Game. Os Pontos Obscuros de Eversion são sempre sua trilha sonora que faz o Player ir à um estágio de "depressão" eu acho... bom, isso depende se você tem problemas com pressão alta. Um dos pontos obscuros também são as mensagens aleatórias do Games que te só deixam o Player assustado por alguns segundos como a mensagem: "Atrás de Você, Morra e Game Over". Eversion com sua versão HD tem um preço aceitável na Steam que embora de pequeno, curto e infantil, traz uma boa experiência de Game Play e de Atmosfera pois é o que o Game mais se aprimorou nisso. Recomendo para Amantes de Terror e aqueles que almejam matar alguem chato com causas respiratórias.","May 20, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It plays and looks very much like Mario; you bounce around collecting things whilst killing monsters by landing on their heads. Get to the end of the game and rescue the princess. It’s all very basic stuff – or so one would think.\n\nWhat makes this game unique is that the main character has the ability to manipulate the world around him. When that happens, certain objects in the game change. Clouds solidify, making them safe to walk on. Trees become withered, allowing you to walk through them. Monsters stop moving, plants turn hazardous, rocks turn into rock monsters, and so on and so forth. There are seven different stages of world alteration, and not only does it change the graphics and objects, but also the music soundtrack as well.\n\nAs you traverse each level (there are eight in total), you experience… well… let’s just say you experience. Sorry to cut this review rather short, but saying anything else might result in unintentional spoilers.\n\nI’ll round it off by saying this; Eversion is no Spelunky. It’s no Shovel Knight, and it’s certainly no game that will last you several weeks or months. That’s Eversion’s one big drawback; it doesn’t last very long. I’ve played it for two hours, and virtually uncovered everything the game had to offer.\n\nHaving said that, I recommend Eversion to anyone mature, who want to discover something a little out of the ordinary.\n\nScore: 73/100","July 22, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The horror elements are very, very well done, although I might appreciate them more if I were familiar with the works of Lovecraft. The core mechanic is fun to play around with for a while - it starts to lose its appeal eventually, but by that point the game is almost over. The leaderboard feels a bit half-baked - the controls are awkward, and you can't scroll the list - but it gets the job done. It's also one of those games where you think you've just paid for a 2 hour game, but then you realise there's a whole lot more. It is for this reason that I recommend trying to get all the achievements.","April 29","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
