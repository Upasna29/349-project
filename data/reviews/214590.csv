Commands are fluid and there are many different spells to acquire (although you can only equip 4 at a time).\n\nAs you kill monsters you'll receive experience which will boost your stats and mana which can be used to buy passive abilities and special moves. You'll level up naturally while playing, there is no need to grind the same level over and over. The game progresses quickly, you won't be spending much time on the same level so you can just drop it and pick it up anytime. However there are ton of steam achievments that can keep you occupied for a long time!\n\nArt is obviously heavily anime inspired, so unless you're into animes you're probably not going to like it very much.\n\nHistory is very cliched with some anime light-hearted humour, but enjoyable.\n\nOverall this game is pretty fun to play, There is a free demo on Steam, so make sure to check it out before deciding whether to buy or not this game!","November 25, 2013","true","6.3"," 66 of 80 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","66","80","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bokxie/recommended/214590/","Bokxie","Bokxie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bokxie/","513 products in account","Fairy Bloom Freesia is a game well loved for it's combat mechanics, but other elements also makes me want to recommend this game so much.\n\nI'll start with the combat. It's pretty difficult for me to explain, but it has the gameplay of Action RPG games like Tales of, but much more simplified, which isn't necessarely a bad thing. The only disadvantage to this gameplay is that there are only a few enemies throughout the game which just come back with different color schemes.\n\nYou fight as an anime fairy forest girl who is protecting said forest from bad things. There is no exploration though, as you just fight enemy waves with bosses after a select amount. Don't worry though, after every wave you go back to the intermission, where you can equip and upgrade skills, and save so you can take a break from the game. A shout out to Edelweiss for making some really good and interesting boss battles, with the exception of the first boss.\n\nThe graphics and music are really appealing, but that might be different according to your taste. Another thing I like is personal, but a big reason why I love this game. It comes in the form of references, though some are incorrect. For example, the main girl is not a reference, but looks and acts like one of my favorite Anime characters ever called Last Order. And lets not forget the achievement which is a direct reference to Madoka Magica, one of my favorite Animes of all time.\n\nThis game also has a great replay value. After you have completed the main story, several different modes unlock, with much more challenges than you have faced before in this game.\n\nI might be a little biased when it comes to this game because it had several things that I look forward to in a game. But these are somewhat personal preferences, so I'd advise you to check out the demo first. And if you enjoyed the demo, then you will for sure enjoy the game.","July 20, 2014","true","4.3"," 34 of 35 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","34","35","0","0"

I love how every action and skill for this game, the boss was quite challanging and the gameplay was pretty decent. The controls are good, people highly recommand you to play this using a controller but it's not like you really needed it. I played the game using keyboards only and still find it fun. The storyline for this game was quite short, but I wasn't really into the story. There weren't many bugs except that if you update the game, then it just destroy the game for you. The graphic was nice, I like how every skill you cast and has that effect for it. The music for this game was beautiful as well, main menu theme are my favorite so far. So in conclusion, I would say this game is quite fun if you're looking for that anime beat em up game.

Imagine the endless enemy mode of a Super Smash Bros. game.\n\nOkay, maybe that's not that fun of an experience to think about paying money for but this game shines in the depth of its combat system. Controls are suprisingly similar to Smash Bros. but with lots of room for the customization of your set of "special" moves.\n\nFairy Bloom Freesia does have its flaws though, a really short story mode with predictable characters and THE TWO (the big one and the small one) enemies being the most noticable. There are challenging boss fights to mix things up from time to time but also annoying protect-the-big-glowing-orb missions thrown in as filler for a game already lacking in any exciting content.\n\nOverall, this is a game to just lose yourself in. A game to put yourself on auto-pilot to and amaze yourself with 999 combos and juggling for dayz.\n\nNote: A couple of the steam achievements are either translated poorly from japanese or bugged to the point where you can actually get them to count.

Definitely one of the better ones on my list.\n\nBy no means is it perfect, but it has plenty of charms going for it.\n\nGood:\n\nI liked how fluid and easy the combat system is. Punches, kicks, slices, bashes, and magic bolts all flow into each other well in what is, essentially, a free form combo system. Smack enemies around however you want using an array of acquired skills and special moves; primarily with the goal of locking enemies into painful juggle combos and smashing them into the hordes for group damage. It is quite satisfying to high kick an enemy into the air, use a Ether Saber uppercut, and then Reverse Spin kick them backwards into the row of enemies behind you.\n\nThere are also some rpg aspects there; but it's not really developed. You get experience and 'level up' but it's not all that noticable. You do however get to buy upgrades and equip new special skills and passive skills to change your style and tweak your game. A fair variety of magic attacks, melee skills, and useful passives lets you come up with quite a few interesitng combinations, and with the free form combo system included it's hard to imagine the sheer number of attack patterns and strategies at your disposal.\n\nIt's a good challenge too! Surprisngly difficult and unforgiving at times for such a cute theme. Bosses have a whole repertoire of special moves that they can play on random, and are quite capable of keeping up with the agile little fairy brawler. Hordes of faceless mobs will pummel you to the ground, shoot you mercilessly, and all together are quite capable of overwhelming the heroine and knocking her out in seconds. It's a game you have to stay on your toes with.\n\nThe music is also good and plays well to the different settings. There is also some japanese voice acting, so that's cool I guess?\n\nAnd the game is cute. Freesia's a sweetheart to be sure. But if you aren't into anime stuff then there's not much story or lore going on anyways. Cutscenes are pretty barebones with still graphics and text that are overall pretty short, with in game animated scenes lasting only a second or two. Everything else is pretty much left up to the player's imagination. Characters are kind of interesting in personality and design, but you really don't see enough of them to make it count. It's overall standard anime/fantasy story stuff, and that works for me.\n\nBad:\n\nThe game is painfully short. Can be beaten in under an hour if you're fast. Maybe two or three hours on the higher difficulties where you'll be taking your time. For such a sweet and well developed game, it ends quickly and becomes repetitive soon after; albiet still quite amusing.\n\nRepetitiveness is the main problem here. It's not terrible, but defintely the weakest point in this game. There are only five main arenas to fight on, and only four enemy types(short, tall, flying, and giant). Some enemies develop into sub-species with alternate attacks, but for most of the game you'll be facing hordes of the same four faceless enemies again and again. It doesn't help that the first boss is just a bulked up version of a regular enemy as well (thankfully the remaining human boss fights are much more diverse).\n\nThere is also a sort of endless quest mode, called 'Guardian Mode', that has you try to fight for 99 levels of randomly selected waves, but that's even more repetitive.  Sometimes I ended up clearing a level only to fight the exact same lvel setup right after; there's not even much variety in the randomized stages!\n\nIt is a little slow in the beginning too, when you don't have any basic skills upgraded (and with the first boss not really being that hard), you're stuck using the same moves over and over, and it's easy to get a bad first impression for the game. Things don't start getting interesting until the second arena, but with the game being as short as it is that is a huge minus.\n\nBut with the lack of diversity in the challenges aside, it's still a pretty fun game.\n\nOverall: I would have liked a little more variety and challenge, and maybe even a little more story as this game is quite charming despite being relatively simple.  The rpg mechanics could have been a bit more interesting too, but I won't exactly criticize that.\n\nIt's a simple beat-em-up about a cute fairy trying to save her tree that features a pretty awesome free form combo system that lets you smash around enemies and tear apart hordes of faceless golems in whatever fashion you want. Despite it's cute theme and repetitive challenges, it is quite difficult and quite fun to play. A "can pick up and finish in an hour" short, but still good fun while it lasts. There are multiple difficulties, plenty of skills to master and try out, a new game+ mode, and an endless mode too if you want a little extra fairy fighting action.\n\nIt's just plain fun, and cute as a button to boot. I recommend it, especially for the low price. If you like beat 'em ups then there's no reason not to give this one a swing.\n\n","November 5, 2014","true","10.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheComboAddict/recommended/214590/","TheComboAddict","TheComboAddict","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheComboAddict/","167 products in account","Alright, just so you know what you are getting yourself into, I've played way too many fighting games to count, I love combo crazy and challenging beat em ups and hack and slash games such as God Hand, but there's nothing I love more than when a game gives you so much freedom to release the combo cancelling ♥♥♥♥♥ in yourself.\n\nFairy Bloom Freesia in short is literally like taking: Super Smash Bros or Kirby's simple controls (or Project M turbo mode in general); general things we fighting gamers love in fighting games (cancel combos, parries, etc); Devil May Cry/Bayonetta with its combo craziness of aerial raves, jump cancelling, dodge canceling, air dash cancelling; and then taking God Hand's customization of the moveset and its experimental ways of combos and cancels. Put all these into one, and you get Fairy Bloom Freesia\n\nSimilar to God Hand, the story doesn't necessarily take itself to serious as they make jokes to some popular memes and even stereotypes of characters commonly found in games occasionally. There are even some achievements that are callouts to other game franchises such as Devil May Cry like the Aerial Rave achievement. In fact, even most of the design in the game isn't anyhting to crazy in terms of backgrounds and stages because the concentration is all on you having fun and exploiting the gameplay mechanics to your advantage, just the way God Hand did. This game literally wants to have fun with the freedom it gives you to make plenty of dream combos.\n\nThe stage design of the game kinda takes a little bit from Smash Bros being a small arena that monsters spawn in with some platforms here and there that you can jump on. While some backgrounds look pretty, you'll notice some repeated objects or just nothing much because the game wants to keep you in the moment of the fight. These stages will be repeated an amount of times, (5 I think), before you fight the boss of the section which can prove challenging if you don't practice up on your just guards, dodges, and cancels (not cancelling out of moves can leave you open sometimes.)\n\nThe controls are very simple to grasp and work flawlessly with the game....especially when you cancel them combos. Just don't be afraid to experiment. Moves don't always have to chain into another move, you can chain straight into a dodge if you need to keep yourself from getting attacked.\n\nRpg elements are included in the game in which you level up getting experience from defeating monster, and also gain mana which can be used to upgrade your normal moveset, gain special moves that can be set to your special attack directions, and passive abilities such as HP boost, berserker (probably super armor), and reducing how much guard crush guage is filled when attacked. Stats also increase with each level up, though, whether the stats gained are random or not, that I cannot confirm.\n\nThis is honestly a great game to unwind and relax with especially for fighting game, beat em up, and hack n slash lovers. The freedom of being able to just go wild and make long cancel combos is just a beautiful dream. However, there is one flaw with the game in which the combo meter does not go away after you stop attacking and even if you get hit in the middle of a combo. It lasts about 5 seconds before it actually leaves. This in a way is a flaw but almost seemed necessary to reach the 1000 hit combo achievement for those who can't "dante must die" the game. It also make its possible to get a pretty high score through less effort for veterans of these games, though, sometimes you'll drop said combo trying to reach a far off enemy. This hardly affects the gameplay otherwise.\n\nIf this game is on sale...do not hesitate to buy it. heck, even if it wasn't on sale, the demo would have convinced me to buy it full price. But what really sold me, because I'm Captain Sheepy...is that "Tetsuzanko" Is a special ability. (Akira Yuki's back strike....Bayonetta?...Yun from Street Fighter 3?....Kyo Kusanagi? Paul Phoenix?...you know, what people call the shoulder charge?)","June 21, 2014","true","8.8"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

After that, the sceen goes into a dialog with the many lead villians as they explain why they need to do what they are doing. Whether it is to acquire an item from the heart of the forest or just following the wishes of their master.

The locations will eventually change but you will be locked into those for a while also.\n","April 5, 2015","false","2.9"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","0"

The graphics were cute and the reviews seemed to be decent.  I don't play many Beat 'em Up games, so I thought this might be a nice entry to the series (the only Beat 'em Up I play is SSB and I'm only decent at Rosalina because of Luma)\n\nWhen you start the game, you are faced with two difficulties, easy and normal.\nAt first I picked easy, as I thought that I wouldn't be any good, but I ended up going to normal, as I decided that this would help get me good.\n\nThis game is really fun and addictive.  The character models are cute, although the backgrounds and textures aren't necessarily HD.\nThe RPG elements in this game make it really fun, and you can experiment with the game.\n\nOccassionally I'll lose the level (rarely more than once per level), but through that, I will get better and learn.\nThis game is a work of art.\n\nThe only issue I've run into is that when setting Anti-Aliasing at all, the whole game runs incredibly slower.  Not just slower FPS, but the whole game lags.  My computer should be able to handle it (16 GB of RAM and 4GB of VRAM with an i7).\nAlso steam overlay doesn't work in the game.\n\n\nNote that when I'm writing this review I'm 6 hours into the game and nowhere near finishing it.  Probably because I take my time in the game, but also because I'm not great, since most people seem to finish it in 3 hours.","January 4, 2015","true","10.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","2"

(There is no penalty to dying)\nBosses are challenging and just not that fun, since they can easily stun-lock you, have longer range attacks than you and generally take a ton of damage to take down.\n\nThe plot is forgettable and inoffensive, a group of humans comes to Freesia's forest looking for a gem of great magical power. Freesia fights the more aggressive ones, befriends the more friendly ones and then saves them all from something threatening their city. The end.\n\nWhere the game really drops the ball is in variety. There are only a handful of enemies and maybe 5 areas to play in, divided into ~30 missions. This makes for a very monotonous experience, since stage after stage just look and feel the same. Enemies don't change up their look, Freesia has no cosmetic options like alternate outfits, etc.\n\nWith a passable and hectic combat system, decent character levelling and a New Game+ feature that lets you start over at level 1 but keep all your acquired skills this is most definitely not a bad game.\nHowever, unless you're really a fan of the genre you will likely grow tired of its formula well before the end.","June 24, 2014","false","10.3"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","0"

Theres like 4 or 5 main enemies that just get recolored throughout the game, however they DO get new attacks as the game goes on, so the variety is actually a bit better than it may originally seem. Even though the enemy models may be few (and in some cases boring or ugly), Freesia (the main character) and the bosses are all unique and look sufficiently pretty. The character designs are kept simple and I personally think it works pretty well. What they did NOT skimp out in in the art aspect are the absolutely gorgeous particle effects which really help drive the feel of the action home. The cutesy anime art style is understandably offputting and doesn't mesh with the typical target demographic of this game at all, and may be hard for a lot of people to look past. I personally don't mind it at all and think it give the game just a hint of charm to it (similar to Recettear), but if you're not particularly into the Japanese art style then the overall asthetic just isn't for you most likely.\n\nSpeaking of Japanese, the game comes fully playable in Japanese and English. The English translations are good enough for the skill descriptions and tutorials. I can't speak for the story as I skipped over most of it, but I assume it was also competently done as well. However, no matter what language you decide the text to be in, the spoken language is always Japanese. As a Japanese language hobbyist, this again doesn't really matter to me, and probably shouldn't matter TOO much for anyone else either (everyone loves to play as Marth or Roy in Smash Bros, and they only talk Japanese). Just be prepared to be hearing Freesia yell "IKUZO!" all the time (Which is the equivalent to some dude yelling "HERE WE GO!" every time he punches someone). The Japanese seem to like particularly vocal characters, Freesia and the humanoid bosses not being exempt from this. It would have been nice if they gave them subtitles though (which they did not).\n\nLong story short, theres a special ability that lets you launch an enemy into the air with a double butterfly kick, encase them in a ball of magic and LITERALLY slam dunk them into the rest of the enemies on the ground, making sure to do a few flips on the way down for good measure.\n\nGet this game (when its on sale).","June 2, 2014","true","2.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The cast is quiant is and easy to enjoy as you progress. The overall story is pretty short and is about 3 hours of gameplay start to finish. The graphics are great and the backgrounds and arenas are really stunning and the game looks like it handles well on weaker machines im sure even at AAx16. The offers a i suppose if you are a slow learner and progress bit by bit its kind of a Rouge-Like wave style arena that lets you carry over saves so if you crap out you can carry all your skillz over to the next save. I will say the game shines its best at boss fights as they provide an adequate challenge thats fresh and not as tedious as the average grind is and really does require some skill to get through, and also show alot of creativity in thier designs and patterns.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/katobytes/recommended/214590/","katobytes","KatoBytes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/katobytes/","87 products in account","Its about time a game like Fairy Bloom Freesia has come across my way. Featuring a endearing loli-esque protagonist to dive into the conglomeration of Beat 'em up games available on Steam, you can only infer by the gallery and thumbnail that you are in for a treat. Should the average player overlook a handful of flaws that were evident already by its kawaii demeanor, Freesia will be one to dazzle.\n\nDid the kawaii tag applied to this game grab your attention? Well, that's because this game exudes moe profusely. Character models, particularly Freesia and Plum-chan, are given a very cute essence to them, which will automatically secure a good 60% percent of the weeaboo consumer-base for this game, Including myself; I'm a hopeless weeb as well. Hell, I'd be damned if I didn't give heed to the fact that even the ♥♥♥♥ing golems have a anomalous charm to them, they're just so small and squishy and- getting ahead of myself here. The playing stages are given a seasonal makeover occasionally as the game progresses, keeping the eyes fed when it starts to get boring. In contrast, the enemies never recieve that same variation other than a color palette swap to accomodate to the background in question. Besides that, the game offers something different than the norm we regularly see here on Steam, so the aesthetic direction is something that is has going for it.\n\nWith remote intuition from playing fighters of any kind, you can anticipate a sub-par or at least mediocre story. This is where Fairy Bloom Freesia will most likely meet those expectations. The narrative provided here spans across 25 days as you assume control of Freesia, a fairy-figured dollface as you defend Lita Forest and your Master, the omnipotent Jomon Tree from golems (I think that's what they are) and humans who come to the forest under the pretext of taking away the gem encompassing the life of Jomon with orders of fueling an ultimate weapon...or something of the sort. The story here is presented to the player in a style equivilant to that of a visual novel, which may either lead some astray or captivate fans of the genre, which even then will most likely lead to the former. This is due to the fact that the way visual novels play out have the propensity of stressing the specific quriks of characters that make them different from others, and in this case they just so happen to be vapid and once again uninspired. Going under the preconcieved notion that you have not been living under a rock, chances are you have seen the personalities showcased here before. The zealous protag, the pervert, the calm and composed colleague, the eerie weapon of destruction, etc.. You've been there. But nothing will bewilder players more than that ending, which by the way, leaves a ponderous amount of unanswered questions and opportunites that will never come to fruition unless a sequel is in the works, which I doubt there is one if sufficient research was done. I wasn't expecting much from the Story Mode but it for some reason left quite a bit to be desired.\n\nA rather dense and humdrum story, yes, but that doesn't nullify it's ability to entertain the player, as the gameplay is rich with fun. One can argue that Fairy Bloom Freesia is essentially a button masher, which the game is to some degree, but the game also allows for more intricate styles of play. Learning how to manuever properly is going to be players' utmost priority, as later on in the game it becomes impossible to not die instantly without the right "stepping". With continuous play of the game, Freesia will transform to a one-loli arsenal as you will unlock an impressive variety of stat boosts and special moves for players to sort as they see fit. Some special attacks are harder to use than others, but the time frame between combo hits is broad, and enemies can collide with eachother, so this grants you the power to land sublime combos nonetheless. It is this metamorphosis of Freesia and the 300+ number displayed on the combo counter that will drive players to stetch through any ordeals they might endure as the game is played. Overall, the game is simple to pick up once you get a knack for the fundamentals, which might bring about a discernable blemish in the game. The game is ♥♥♥♥ easy for it's majority. The average beat 'em up player can feasibly pass Story Mode on Normal in about 2 hours max, and again on Difficult in another 2 since you are provided the ease of preserving your upgrades when you start another new game. Only when you reach Day 70 on Guardian Mode (Which is in essence a Horde/Wave defense mode) or attempt to conquer the story on Cruel will you truly begin to pull your hairs and bargain with the devil. Shynie in general is also another nightmare of boss, the difficulty spike induced by her is unparalleled. Despite the lack of replayability, Fairy Bloom Freesia succeeded to build a solid brawler experience from the foundation up.\n\nFYI: If you can, it would behoove you to play this game with some sort of gamepad (X360, DS3, a ♥♥♥♥ing Nyko for all I care) because the keyboard contols are a tad-bit awkward. It's also adds convienience, no matter what the glut of PC elitists insist.\n\nTo reiterate from the intro paragraph, if you are so good as to pardon the shortcomings that mostly stem from the story itself, be ready to have a great amount of fun. Its $8 dollars and well worth that price tag. Combos and lolis. Like come on. I'm getting tired of typing here. I'd recommend it for sure.","March 26, 2015","true","15.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I bought the bundle for other games and did't play this until a while after.  If I'd known how fun the game is, I'd have bought it at full price long ago.\n\nAt the core, it's like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta in 2D, but with a large emphasis on knocking enemies into each other.  As you learn the game and upgrade your skills you start to build crazier combos, which I think gets really fun (I'm up to about 550 hits in a combo).  If you like action/combo oriented games, this is a great game.  I've heard the game be compared to Smash Brothers.  In my opinion, it is not anything like it (and I have competed in and won large tournaments in Melee and Brawl).  It is single player and much more combo-based.  On Smash, when was the last time you got a combo greater than 20 on someone that knew how to play the game?\n\nAll of the levels are arena based.  Some may not like this, but I thought it was perect for the game because it keeps the action fast-paced, which is what the game is all about.\n\nA major point of criticism for the game might be it's length.  It only takes 1 - 2 hours to beat the game.  That being said, there is a new game plus mode along with several difficulty settings.  Personally, I beat the game and turned right around and played it most of the way through again in the same sitting (I've now beaten it three times).  Beyond the story mode, there is another mode which runs much longer.  It is a survival mode of sorts that challenges you to go through 99 phases with only occasional saving, which can be a greater challenge than the main story.\n\nOverall, the controls are perfect, the action is intense, the replay value is incredible.  The story and characters are lame, but there is little emphasis on this, so it didn't bother me much.  I thought the music was pretty forgettable.\n\nI know this is not the kind of game everyone will enjoy, but for me as a serious action/brawler game fan, it has landed a place in my "Greats" category.  I will definitely be returning to this game many times over the years.","April 19, 2015","true","10.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/recommended/214590/","Anitude","Annie T. Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","A deceptively action-heavy beat-'em-up with a little i-frame dodging and combos and parry-like guards and blahblah.\nThe entire thing's short in content from the simplistic plot to the level arenas to the fairy protagonist herself. The graphics and artwork ain't exactly top-notch.\n\nI don't know if it's just me but for whatever reason, when looking at the control settings, all I saw was the control layout for a controller. It seemed doable with a keyboard but playing with a controller appeared more appropriate anyway for a game like this.\n\nOn my end, some of the font is broken. Some letters and special characters are replaced with a white rectangle as opposed to something normal. Apparently my fix for that was to set my system's locale to Japanese.\n\nThe base game, its Story Mode, doesn't take more than a few hours to complete and is much shorter if attempts at skipping the cutscenes is made. The way it goes with Story Mode is that you go through levels, or "Days", fighting waves of baddies, which don't even come in many varieties anyway aside from a color difference that dictates what's a weaker or stronger version of what enemy. Sometimes you'll also be protecting one or three of these "Vortex" things from enemy damage until the level's over.\nFor every 5 days, it's a boss battle and then a map change the next day. Aside from maybe the first boss they're pretty engaging with how fast they can be if you're not careful and it helps that they become a good change of pace from the possible repetitiveness of doing the same kind of levels over and over again.\nDays themselves don't take very long to complete and after a day's through you immediately go through an "Intermission" state where you can train, save progress, and buy & upgrade skills using the "Mana" dropped from baddies as currency.\nThe skills are categorized in 3 sections; Basic, Special, & Optional where the last two must be equipped manually. The Basic skills add new attacks to your regular combos where you're to use the right buttom prompts to properly perform. One of the Basics is a "perfect guard" of sorts where if an attack is guarded at the right time the attack meter doesn't fill up, which when it does breaks your guard and damage is inflicted to you. The Special skills are basically active attack skills that are activated depending on which of the four possible Special skill slots they're equipped on. Each specific slot is supposed to be something like where a Special skill is added to the slot that has [Up + Special Attack] and then that attack would only activate with the specified combination. The Optional skills are essentially automatically activated passive skills of sorts mainly consisting of buffs which you can only equip two of.\nThe only way to figure out exactly how helpful each active skill is is to test them out in a fight. Since there were so many Basic and Special skills I didn't really bother figuring out all of them and just kept sticking to what was already helpful and replacing what wasn't.\nAll attacks & combos themselves are simple & fast and aren't very hard to pull off. The Basic and Special skills being a little more simpler to use so it's just a matter of using them at optimal times.\n\nIn addition to the game's sub-par graphics most enemies fire projectiles of sorts that use a glow-y effect of some kind. Amidst the likely chaos from duking it out with the waves of enemies, there's going to be a some fancy effects that occur making many of these projectiles likely difficult to even notice. Often times they'll phase through enemies that can lead to completely unnoticed damage to you.\nIt's apparently pretty easy to get stunlocked mid-air and easier when baddies just start raining down. As far as I know there isn't an "air recovery" of sorts to compensate for that.\n\nThe replayability relies on the increased difficulty modes for Story Mode and a Guardian Mode. Guardian Mode is basically just the same objectives only there are 99 days in total, 3 continues, tougher enemies as you get further in, and intermissions only come every somethingnumber days depending on how far you're in to it.\nIf not just repetitive it ain't too bad of a short & simplistic beat-'em-up.","April 24","true","15.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

The game itself, isn't very long, but the combat stages are very fun and enjoyable. The story could use some work, but I think the main purpose of this game is for the player to basically just fight. Freesia's (the faery) moves are very fluid and easy to combo with, I feel that the enemies could use a bit of variety. I'm pretty sure the game is finished, but it'd be nice to see the developers make another game similar to this one. They could implement special powers for the future protagonist to have in addition to their martial abilities.\n\nThe controls for the keyboard are a little finicky and require a bit of preparation before playing. In addition, the key are marked as, "Key 1", "Key 2", etc., so it is a little confusing as to what key you're actually using. Fortunately, this game does support controllers, which make things a little easier.\n\nOverall, I think this game is worth the small amount of money, and is definitely a fun little game for everyone to enjoy.","February 15, 2014","true","5.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Letting aside that the developers clearly have a goo fetish, the selection is extremely weak and everything results to the same strategies. Always. No exceptions. When they are grouped regardless of the kind of enemy it's actually pretty fun to simply slam them into each other racking up combos and all, but if you are to put them aside and consider, it's very weak on the main aspect. Then there are the general backgrounds and scenarios which also lack in variety, having to go through 5 waves (there are a total of 30 waves; 5 of which are bosses) on the same level.\nThen there are the bossess which do kind of recover, the bosses have clear variety, their difficulty always bases on your skill to block and how to manage things and generally fun. Except the first one, which is a enormous version of the "huge slime", which is annoying enough already; so I am not really happy with the first boss. But bosses after that felt really vivid and were fun to fight. However it's what I would expect from a fighting game on a daily bases; so I am afraid that does not save the rating.\n\nVisually the game is a individual JRPG so I am not expecting next gen graphics. If I am going to go with the artstyle I could say it's cute enough and everything fits well together.\n\nRegarding the characters (even though there is barely any interaction), I think too much lolicon is going on regarding Listine. I don't /particularly/ mind it but it's completely out of hand and makes you go like "...what". Outside of that the game also offers a tiny story which comes up with a twist. I will keep this spolier-free but I will still say that the ending is very dissapointing and not expanded upon at all.\n\nOverally this is a good game with potential. If it had a bigger enemy and map variation, maybe more useful skills (I found many of the skills you unlock later pretty pointless, but they may just not fit to my playlist) and perhaps a rehash of the storyline and this could be a pretty good release. The game is extremely stable otherwise and enjoyable.","March 1, 2014","true","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I picked it up in a Humble Bundle and one day decided to try it out. Though it looked like nothing special at first, i was quite suprised by how much genuine fun i was having playing it. This game is a simplistic 2D arena fighting/beat 'em up game where you play as a strange little moe fairy princess thing. Though the story and characters are nothing special, the combat is what really shines. Its simple, with 1 button for attacks, 1 for specials skills, and one for blocking. However, this simplistic control scheme really works, with the game being easy to pick up and play at first, but gradually becomes harder and has a bit of a learning curve. Once you get into the later levels, you're going to have to learn how to string dashes, attacks, specials, and blocks if you plan on actually surviving. If you fail to utilize these combat options in the correct way, you will most likely end up being juggled in mid air by countless numbers of monsters. This simple yet satisfying combat style is what keeps me playing, regardless of its sub par story and graphics.

Don't expect a long playtime.\n\nSoundtrack 8/10\nThe song is well fitted with the game. It's okay.\n\nGraphic 9/10\nFor an indie game, the graphic is really nice. The motion is really smooth. Except for the boss, some fo them looks clunky. Maybe that's just me.\n\nAnyway, this game is worth buying if you like this kind of genre.","November 26, 2013","true","5.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Freesia is acceptable, but Shinye sounds weird and Listine sounds like mouthwash. The design isn’t bad though, and the characters are likeable enough. The scenarios are decent but not great in number so they eventually become repetitive as you go through level after level after level without anything changing around you. The enemies have the same problem, there’s only a handful of different ones, which you will be facing ad nauseam in waves.\nThe difficulty is pretty solid, especially if you play on Cruel mode and the extra modes are challenging as well and require some practice, especially the levels where you have to defend the rifts. It took me quite a while to get past some of them in Hard difficulty, but after that when I went into Cruel I already had the tactics down so it was easier. The bosses are challenging as well, at least until you learn their attack patterns. From there on you can avoid damage completely as long as you are careful.\nThat being said, I liked the game, it was all about frenetic fun and slashing through endless hordes of enemies, levelling up, gaining new skills and going through the story. If you want a decent and challenging button masher (heh), you might want to get this one.\n\nAchievements Unlocked: 50/50","January 11, 2014","true","21.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

With its anime theme and its wide array of skills, spells, and buffs, players will suddenly find themselves completing their first play through only to jump back in to unlock what they couldn't do during the first run.  The skills reward the player with blur effects, screen shaking, bright lights, and loud percussive explosions and generally feel really good as they're slicing through their targets.  With an EXP per kill system that is used to unlock spells, players are tasked with chaining the most absurd amount of combos in an attempt to hit the mother load that never ceases to entertain.  The story is very light, however, and can be finished in an hour or two.  There are also very few enemies and gameplay may get stale after noticing that monsters in the final levels are the same as the roster from the first.  Overall, I recommend this game to any anime enthusiast and brawler battler.","January 25, 2014","true","2.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Freesia is cute and the battle system while very simple looks stunning and it feels so amazing and epic when you utilise skills such as short range teleportation to instantly gain an advantage or literally kick one enemy into another and follow up with a series of quickfire magic missiles. One of my absolute favourite moments in any game's battle system so far was on this one:\n\nKnocked in the air, helpless and defenceless as my opponent charges up a thrust, about to pierce through me from above when in a split second reaction I cast an instant teleport spell engulfing my body in a dark purple aura as it vanishes, in the same moment emerging with glorious wings forged of ether light above the swordsman, descending upon him with flashing steel and blinding light as an angel of death, snatching victory from the jaws of defeat in one decisive moment, when we each only had an ounce of health left. THAT is tense and completely amazing, far better than I've experienced in any AAA title.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone with a flare for these kind of moments, the free-flowing style of combat and the fast paced action can really capture your passion and change from player to player, creating a unique experience.","January 31","true","0.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Other wise it is very short, takes about 3 hours to complete all 25 levels, could use some work on skills and how to activate them as well as perhaps a message that tells you that you actually have to equip powers since it wasnt until level 10 that relised there was an option to equip them, i just though they were being auto applied like the passive spells. Weak story but cute animations and good gameplay.

It isn't.\nFairy Bloom Freesia is essentially one of the Multi-Man Melee challenges from Super Smash Bros.\nIf you don't know what I'm talking about, you're set down in a 2D arena and besieged by a bunch of enemies until you've defeated them all.\nSo far I've seen two different arenas and neither has been different enough to matter in terms of gameplay. After each level (they're more like rounds) you're given the option to spend points you've earned on upgrading your abilities and aquiring moves. All this is fine. It isn't great, some isn't even good, but it's baseline decent.\nWhat's really terrible about this game are the endless text-based story segments you have to click through to get to the next piece of gameplay. These might be alright if the story made any sense or was interesting at all.\nIf you're 12 and really into anime of all kinds, you might enjoy the story. That's not a value judgement, that's the demographic I think this game is aimed at, and I think it's probably alright if you're in that demographic. As a 26 year old dude, the story does nothing for me, and frankly it's a bit weird playing as what appears to be a 10 year old fairy girl.\n\nIf you're looking at this game and thinking maybe the gameplay will make up for everything else, I have to tell you that it doesn't. That doesn't mean this is a terrible game. You'll probably get some enjoyment out of punching weird plant things for a few rounds, but really I wouldn't buy this unless you meet any two of the following criteria:\nA) Know it's arena-based\nB) Saw the characters and thought "Hey that looks like my kind of thing"\nC) Can get it for $2 or under.","July 15, 2014","false","1.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

On a whim I decided to play it the other day.  Holy crap. If I had known I had a game like this in my library, I would have beaten it long, long ago. It is a brilliant blend of the combat system from the Tales games, Smash Brothers, Beat-em-ups, and (to some extent) bullet hells. It has a pretty bare storyline, but the boss fights are to die for.  A short story, but added logetivity in Guardian mode, which is a wave endurance mode.  If you can pick this up, DO IT.

Freesia does things differently. For example, it has:\n+intuitive controls\n+an efficient tutorial in the first level\n+features and combos that are introduced bit by bit over the first 1/5 of the game\n+an amazingly well crafted difficulty curve and levelling system\n+animations that deserve some kind of award for being both clear and pretty\n\nThe rest of the review is in the "pros/cons list" format because i'm lazy.\nPros (in addition to the above):\n+Awesome art\n+An actual story that makes sense and is engaging (not extensive or a masterpiece, but it fits the game well)\n+Characters that aren't 2 dimensional. I was actually invested in them\n+A levelling system with distinctive and rewarding choices that are well balanced\n+More than enough variety in enemies, objectives, setting, etc. to keep me engaged throughout the campaign\n+New game plus features that i actually want to play/unlock/etc.\n+Music that complements gameplay well\n+Plenty of content; normal campaign alone took me about 7 hours, and there's heaps to do afterwards (my guess is another 30 hours that i would be happy to play through. Only played 4 hours more so far though)\n\nCons:\n-I can't really think of any? It's worth the asking price 3 times over in my opinion\n\nI'll probably update this once i've played more.

Combos are fun, and there are many different skills and ways to beat the crap out of everything. Higher difficulties and Guardian mode provide a good challenge.\n\nStory mode is a bit short, but after you beat the game once you unlock a higher difficulty (up to 2 higher difficulties after Normal) and you can start from the beginning with your previously learned skills if you wish. It also unlocks Guardian mode, which is 4 times longer than Story and is quite harder. The stages are randomly generated (except bosses), and it doesn't have cutscenes, which is great since you can't skip them directly and you can jump right into action.","January 3, 2014","true","17.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cfal/recommended/214590/","cfal","cfalcon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cfal/","369 products in account","2D arena beat-em-up where you're a cute anime fairy girl who lives in and protects a forest from slimes and flying creature. Story mode consists of the following: four levels (or days) of killing monsters then a boss fight. Rinse and repeat four more times and you complete story mode. You can perform slashes with your dagger and kicks by repeatedly pressing the attack button and juggle enemies into the air. You also have a guard you can perform to block attacks. There's a guard meter that fills as you block more attacks and your guard will break if you block too many hits in a row.\n\nAs you kill monsters, you level up and gain Mana (which is the game's currency). Mana is used to purchase three different skills. Mana can be spent after the end of each day in the intermission phase. One category are skills mapped to a button separate from your normal attack button and are special attacks; up to four special attacks can be mapped at once with directional inputs kind of like the Tales of JRPG franchise. The second category is passive skills applied to your attacks for additional properties. The third category is bonuses to your stats ranging from increased HP, increased strength, increasing the amount of hits you can block, increasing physical defense, restoring health from each enemy killed, and so on.\n\nAfter you complete Story Mode, you unlock new difficulty modes and the ability to carry all of your purchases over. You also unlock Guardian mode, which is a gauntlet of 100 days, only 3 continues, and you get an intermission every two days instead of every day like Story Mode. Once you get the hang of the combat and you're juggling enemies left and right, dashing across the screen, and racking up 100+ hit combos, the game is really fun. It's just that the story can be completed in less than two hours on a first playthrough and the bonus content is more the exact same you just did. The game is really fun and a decent challenge while it lasts. I purchased it for $2 during the Autumn sale and I feel like I definitely got my money's worth out of it. At full price, though, I'd be more hard-pressed to feel like it was worth. This is one of those games that's guaranteed to go on sale. You'd be better off waiting for a sale to get it really cheap and blow through it in no time.","December 10, 2013","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story mode takes about 2.5 hours to complete, excluding hard mode. Once you clear the game you open up 'Hard' difficulty and Guardian Mode, as well as some extras under the Gallery option. Plenty of "award" challenges to keep completionists busy for probably 30 hours more.\nGuardian mode is pretty much a gauntlet mode, only allowing intermissions every couple days or so and spawning many more enemies per day than the Story mode's stages usually do.\nThe skill system enables a wide variety of playstyles and makes you think about what you want to use for the next round. However as you play the game more, you'll find out which skill combos work best for most situations.\nMy main gripe about this game come from how little there is in terms of variety of enemy.

Just you, an arena, and more monsters than you can shake a stick at ! The combo system is open and fun to play with. There's several skills to choose from, and passives to suit your playstyle. The story mode is short and simple, but sweet. Guardian mode pits you against endless waves of monsters for as much brawling fun as you can handle. Not to mention full control pad support and steam trading cards. All the art is well done.\n\nThe bad: Unfortunately, with as short as it is I can't quite recommend it at its base 8$ price. There's just not enough there. Once you've completed the story mode all there is is guardian mode and hard difficulty. Though you can usually pick the game up on sale for cheap. Aside from that the main character Lita is the only playable character. There are humanoid bosses that could easily have been made playable characters and they would have added much more enjoyment to the game.\n\nThe ugly: The male characters lol.

I had fun playing it, because the gameplay itself was quite entertaining but you are mostly fighting the same 4 kinds of monster and the ones that appear the most are the small ones and the tall ones. The flying ones an the big golems appear in some levels, but the big golems don't appear as much. This lack of variety can make the game quite repetitive but once you get the hang of the game, the levels go by pretty quickly.\n\nThe boss fights are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t hard. In the second boss fight I did, I may have simply not performed well because I wasn't entirely used to the combat system. The problem is, the human or fairy opponents can still attack you while being attacked while every other enemy and Freesia, can not attack whilst being hit. This puts you at a clear disadvantage because while you are trying to hit the opponent, and often succeeding, they will suddenly kick your ♥♥♥.\n\nFighting the first female boss who shoots projectiles took me a long time to beat since she can just spam projectiles at you the whole time and it gets pretty unfair. Again, she can also still throw projectiles and hit you while being hit herself. There is also a large gap in the difficulty between the regular enemies, and the boss fights as the regular enemies are extremely easy while the boss fights are extremely hard.\n\nOn the plus side, the character models for the humans and fairies are quite good and some of the backgrounds are really nice. The arenas seem to get bigger progressively with more platforms to jump on which can help strategically as well.\n\nOne thing I didn't like about this game, was the artwork for the sort of Visual Novel style bits (where they tell the story). The artwork looks like the kinds of stuff I drew as a 16 year old and not something I would expect to see in a game of this quality. I think to be honest, the game would have been better without the visual novel sections entirely because the story is not very entertaining and the sprites look pretty bad. Freesia's sprite looks good when compared with the others but could still use improvement.\n\n6/10 - It was satisfying to finish, but overall it isn't one of the best games. When you consider the price though, it is definitely well worth it.","February 5, 2015","true","8.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/capt_blakhelm/recommended/214590/","capt_blakhelm","Capt_Blakhelm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/capt_blakhelm/","1580 products in account","TL;DR: It's a cutesy, singleplayer brawler that plays similarly to Super Smash Bros with RPG elements, but with out as much polish and refinment of the combat. It is very enjoyable, though is at times more fustrating that it should be. FBF is fairly short and offers replayability through NG+.\n\nBuy? Maybe. It's an almost too cutesy, Super Smash Bros style brawler set in the Jomon forest, a place dependent on the power of a magical stone that is protected by Freesia. Combat is similar to Smash Bros where you have a simple attack/combo button, jump button, block button and special attack button based on the direction you press.\n\nThe neatest aspect of this is the ability to customize the specials from a wide variety of moves including projectiles, ground smashes, anti-air moves and more. It is presented in an RPG fashion, as more specials unlock as you level up and complete levels. This does mean that you have to figure out which moves you like or need prior to each Day (level), as some are not effective in some situations (especially moves that only work in the air or only work on ground, leaving Freesia doing nothing and wide open to attack, which isn't a problem in SSB). You can unlock all basic attacks, but you have a limit of two "passive buffs" that you can apply. This doesn't make sense to me because there are so many of these buffs and at many times, I feel like I lose so much because I can't use a couple more. Thankfully, the game will tell you if you're up against a boss or protecting a vortex in the next fight.\n\nThe combat is nowhere near as good as SSB. Combos feel good and satisfying, but often are easily interuppted by a near extreme multitude of projectiles thrown by offscreen enemies, requring you to block mid-combo to prevent damage (this may be why the combo reset timer is a bit forgiving). That same block, like SSB, can be broken if you are attacked too much, but it's shown under your HP bar in the upper left corner of the screen, instead of on Freesia, requiring you to take your eyes off the action in intense fights - VERY BAD. Offscreen enemies are a huge nuisance when they are shooting so much while you're dealing with melee enemies - you don't have the ability to deal with it, especially when your block doesn't let you evade out of the way like SSB, just hop around. Bosses never flinch like you do when you are hit mid combo (except when you beat them down to certain points of their health), so you spend most of the time in boss fights playing defensively and nicking at their HP with 2-3 hit combos, so you aren't juggled (while they can also break the block, which is your only real means of defense). I mention offscreen enemies - that means the camera is fixed on Freesia's location, which is not a problem until there enemies beyond the bounds of the screen that can ruin your day - or enemies attacking vortexes you can't see.  I got kinda irritated near the end to amost rage quitting, but thankfully, that was the last battle around 3hrs. There's replayability in NG+ and a Guardian mode that some how didn't save after I beat the game because the game crashed when I messed with resolution settings (even though I could access my 2nd save file that occured after beating the game. Oddly, it acted as if it was before the last battle.). I've seen a Dark Freesia, so there might be more bosses or levels.  This game isn't BAD, it's just isn't as polished as the early Smash Bros games. I'd love to see a really good SSB clone, that maybe has some RPG aspects like this, as well as some exploration. It's important to note that Freesias battle yaps are pretty annoying, since she screams with every attack: it may not bother you, but it will probably bother people around you if you play with speakers.","September 14, 2013","true","3.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","2"

FBF could be classified as a single-stage brawler with combat similar to Super Smash Bros, of all things! Unfortunately, it's held back by some pretty glaring issues.\n\nThe primary feature of this game is the combat, which managed to surprise me in the fact that it seems very one-dimensional on the surface, but quickly becomes frustrating if all you do is button-mash. The game is broken up into small stages, wherein you fight a great number of very squishy, very bouncy enemies. At first it's a blast to just knock them around into each other, but can become overwhelming with the amount of projectiles that can be flying around. Then come the boss fights, which require a great deal of finesse to master and can be gamepad-chuckingly difficult. I suggest 2 approaches: button mashing and flinging moves for the masses, and stamping the block button any time the bosses even twitch.\n\nThe plot is fairly typical japanese stuff filled with fairly typical japanese characters and the RPG elements are the typical japanese grind. The only substance comes from the combat, but there are simply too many things going on to really feel like you are controlling the fun. When you do finally get a good rhythm, though, it can be heaps of fun. But then it ends, cuz this is a fairly short game. At least there's "New Game +" if you're not quite ready to put it down yet.","December 29, 2012","true","5.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Freesia is a game about mastering a really well done and fast paced combat system and racking up insane combos. While painfully short and only having one playable character, the game's real strength is re-playing on high difficulties to get even better combos. The 3d art is really good and well animated, even if the enemies are often generic blobs. The 2d art is terrible and was obviously farmed out to a bunch of different artists. Like some remakes of VNs (muvluv I guess? I've never read a VN...) the contrast of the good art and the bad art is really jarring. Also you need to beat the game to skip the dialog sections which is bad because who cares if the tree is the devil and the tron people are trying to get us to join the centrions or whatever.\nThe game also has boss battles. they're not fun, especially the knife chick. She is not fun. Wars of attrition are not fun. No you shut the ♥♥♥♥ up dad! I'll say whatever the ♥♥♥♥ I want this is-this is MY reccomendation.

Lemur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nalgasdlemur/","949 products in account","Decent but not amazing brawler. It controls like the Smash Bros. games do, with attack and special buttons modified by what direction you're pushing (or leaving input neutral) to perform specific attacks or skills, plus a block button, but it's a bit simplified. However, you do unlock new abilities as you progress through the game and can choose among them which you want to use, so you customize to fit your playstyle with teleports and dashes and counters and projectiles and all sorts of things, depending on what you're into.\n\nIt ends up reminding me most of a cross between a straight up brawler and adventure mode in SSBM. You mostly fight hordes of weaker enemies in single arenas, and then every few levels there's a real boss with as wide a variety of attacks as you have which takes more skill to fight. Speaking of skill, the game is VERY easy most of the way through (you can button mash through about 50% of it, and it doesn't throw much more at you until the 80% point), and even at the end it only makes it to "not very hard". It's entirely possible that the higher difficulties are more challenging, but they're locked until you beat it on normal.\n\nThe story and characters and art and music and all that are all...fine. They're cute and likable and serve their purpose, but I've already pretty much forgotten them even though I finished the game less than half an hour ago, that's how generic they are. I did have enough fun with it to finish story mode, at least, which is more than I can say for a bunch of stuff.","June 3, 2013","true","5.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Don't have Marvel in your life?  Push those buttons.  Push them.  Forever.\n\nThis is one of those fabled Japanese indie games where it's mainly a one-man show.  The total amount of people that worked on this game seemed to be around 13 people based from the credits (and that's including all of the voice actors LOL).  The stages are all mainly the same, and there's only about 5 or 6 different types of enemies throughout the entire game (not including bosses).  Some of the stages and some of the boss battles can be really challenging if you don't pick up on patterns quickly.\n\nI didn't expect anything when I bought this game as the trailer itself looked like the same stages and the same enemies with a very basic combo system.  I'm happy with my purchase and feel like I'll be soaking in a couple of more hours into this game to unlock the harder difficulties.\n\nThe entire game is really really short, but if you like button mashing and creating combos with a wide variety of moves, then this will be a good purchase for you!  The game itself is basically like Digimon Rumble Arena for the PSX or any other 2D platform fighter.  All of the moves are things you've probably seen before from other games, but that's not a bad thing in itself.  There's skills like a teleport or a ground bouncing slash or a rising juggle uppercut and much much more.  The story is cute, and although all the voice acting is in Japanese, you can still understand what's going on from the translated dialogue.\n\nBasically, this game brings nothing new to the table, but it's still a ton of fun.

This experience is used to level up arbitrary stats, unlocking more combos. You have the general light hit, heavy hit, jump and possible another button I never cared about which are used to perform combos and that’s the entirety of the fighting.

You may be thinking to yourself: "This game looks like rubbish! I'm not buying this tub of lard!" Well, you're only thinking that right now. The game is short, but you can play it more than once in a New Game mode with a higher difficulty. The game itself though is already fairly difficult, but it's great fun. The game is seperated into days. Each day you fight a few mobs of monsters throughout the 2.5D beat-em-up forest that you are supposed to protect. Every few days you come across a boss battle until you reach the end of the game. The characters are quite cute in their anime art style; both 3D gameplay and 2D cinematics. Seriously, what kind of anime style anything isn't cute? One thing that bothers me though is the story. While captivating and humorous, I felt as if there could have been more. All-in-all, Fariy Bloom Freesia is probably worth the buy, but you should probably wait for a discounted price.","November 28, 2013","true","4.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

They should not have neglected level design and monster AI. The regular stages all seem an unending slog of motionless targets on relatively unchanging platform orientations. The only difficulty in these portions of the game seems to be the often obscured spew of projectiles that will unavoidably juggle you to death with no chance of recovery beyond the initial hit. That, and perhaps mindlessly keeping track of your own combo count for no other reason than to have a high combo count.\n\nThe game definitely shines in its boss battles, really forcing the player to fight efficiently with an effective character build. Yet even this can be easily cheesed using broken defensive abilities and homing magic, not to mention the boss battles themselves are far and few between. Most disparagingly, the final boss fight ends up being extremely simple and much easier than earlier ones, regardless of unlocked abilities and player skill, as it still holds true in a higher difficulty mode in NG+ which pits you against a hardier variant of each of the bosses to scale with maxed out stats.\n\nIt's enough fun for a pick up and play kind of approach, or for anyone who really gets deep into optimal play, but the longevity doesn't extend much further than an achievement farm. I would definetely consider a sequel or extension, but I cannot recommend this game as a complete package.","December 20, 2013","false","14.5"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","8","21","0","0"

I bought it with a coupon, so I'm not terribly bent out of shape, but I still can't give this game much praise.  Ignoring the fact that this game is near unplayable without a controller, the game's set up is terrible.   Basically, you flucuate between two screens.  An 'intermission' screen between each day, where you can spend earned points, and then the combat screen, which is one of several different seasons/mood variations.   This game looks like it was going to be a fairy themed fighting game, but somewhere along the way they dropped the ball on multiplayer and decided to take their fighting arenas and try to inject a story into it at the last second.\n\nBeat'em Ups made in the 90s have more variation to them than this game.\n\nMost of the enemies are literally reskins of the first few enemies you encounter, with some of the advanced enemies being shrunken versions of bosses, so don't expect to fight a huge variety of enemies.  Also, as far as your actual moves go, you do manage to get an impressive selection of special moves, but none of them are anywhere near as powerful as simply knocking one enemy into another repeatedly, like they were gasoline filled balloons holding matches.\n\nWhere the game does vary is in its difficulty.  At some point, between Summer and Autumn I think, the game's difficulty spikes.  They remind you that you can 'train' in order to become more powerful in order to complete the day(effectively the levels in the stage), but it amounts to you playing against slightly weaker versions of enemies you've already killed.  Yes, they solve this difficulty spike by letting you grind, giving you very little natural progression.\n\nUltimately, this game brings together the worst parts of several genres.  The static 'stage' from Arcade styled fighting games(minus the multiplayer), the grinding of legacy RPGs(Without the depth of story).  The only thing that I can say that this game does right is how Freesia herself moves and responds to controller input.  If they took Freesia out of this game, and put her into a game with better level design, better flow, and less grind, it could easily be a great game.  Unfortunately, Freesia is tethered to her tree.","November 29, 2013","false","1.1"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

You fight monsters by mixing together various attacks and special attacks. There's many possible methods of beating the heads of your opponents ranging from a simple beatdown to throwing them into the ground or you can even play an impromptu game of pinball... using your enemies as the ball.\n\nWhile the game has a short story, you should be looking at this game for the gameplay.\n\nIt's fun.\n\nIt's an Action RPG Beat 'Em Up style game where you can learn new skills to demolish hordes of little (and quite a few not-so-little) clay golems with. The game is challenging, but it never gets to the point where you want to rip out your hair in frustration. Experimenting with new combos is a big part of the charm in the game and whether you're playing to get the best combos and do the best you can or simply playing as a passtime, this game will be worth a look.\n\nAs a small game, it's quite short in terms of story. But it makes up for that with "Guardian Mode", which is effectively a glorified survival mode. Unlike the story, however, Guardian Mode will test your abilities and will push your skills in this game to the limit as it is quite punishing.\n\nAll in all, the game definitely deserves a mention and for a $7.99 price tag is a great way to kill time.","September 9, 2014","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very short and can be beaten within a day, but the fun of it is that you can, after beating the game of course, fight in a wave mode, where you must survive through each amount of days. There are intermissions every so often so that you can add skill points and whatnot, and I suggest you make use of that quickly. You will need it. Play the game in normal difficulty is already like playing it in hard difficulty. You may not notice it at first because the little minions are easy to just knock around as you please, but the bosses are significantly harder. I suggest playing easy first if you're not that great at these types of games and you just want to have fun bashing things around.

It's a really simple game but it's pretty fun. You play as a guardian fairy that protects a magical forest or some such, and a human city nearby ends up looking for a stone that is giving some tree that you talk to life. You fight their golems they send it which pretty much look like muk from pokemon at first. Said fairy is (Stronger than 300 spartans) according to some game dialog. And she does, in fact, ♥♥♥♥ face. I think it's part of the games charm having a main character that looks like a small girl but then giving her special attacks that send people flying across the maps and blasting into one another. If it's on sale when you're considering it I'd say it's worth the money.\n\nPros:\nGood combat with the ability to choose the 4 special abilities you want to use.\nA cartoony (anime like) art style\nCute character, fairy looks like a young girl and for some reason seems to use a green onion as a weapon.\nJapanese voices (honestly no need for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dubs given how little is voiced)\nThrowing enemies into each other is a blast, trying to do some crazy combos is fun as well.\n\nCons:\nAt least as far as I've gotten the enemies don't have very detailed models, aside from bosses.\nThe story isn't terrible but it's not going to keep you on the edge of your seat.\nLevels where you have to protect a vortex can be pretty tedious, if your attack send an enemy flying and it hits the vortex it'll damage it, and given that the enemies cluster around the vortex to attack it that happens quite often. You lose if every vortex is destroyed.\nThe game has controller support, which is good to have the option, but I don't think it's really an option to NOT use a controller. Given the combat style I think keyboard controls would be really difficult and awkward to play with. I don't know for a fact though as I simply used a controller.\n\n","August 17, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like platforming, brawling, beat-'em-up games, cute fairies, lolicon knights, talking trees... or cute fairies that jump on platforms, brawling and beating up all enemies, including a lolicon knight, to protect a forest and a talking tree... then this game's for you!\n\n*Ahem* In all seriousness though, the game is very fun with a lot of replay value. The game consists of many good qualities.\n\nStory Mode - It's fairly short (a few hours), but it consists of a good storyline. It's not too deep, but it's a fighting game and not a Visual Novel. There are multiple difficulties unlocked as you beat the Story Mode, and it includes a New Game+ feature where you can start over from the beginning with the skills you had unlocked on previous playthroughs.\n\nGuardian Mode is especially fun - you can unlock it after finishing the story mode and it consists of fighting through 99 days of increasingly difficult battles (some of which include fighting bosses...or multiple bosses) and ends with you fighting a special boss, who I won't spoil. Your save data from Story Mode does not transfer over to Guardian Mode.\n\nIt's definitely fun and definitely worth the money in my opinion. You can find out yourself if you like the combat style by playing through the demo. I never played the demo so I don't know how long it is, but I've heard it's just the tutorial.","November 29, 2012","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like it much better for this than the Dualshock or 360 controller.\n\nThe good:\n\nIt's 7 bucks\n\nFluid, yet simple combat system\n\nLots of customization options\n\nLevel up system provides boosts in stats as well as any stat boosting skill you have\n\nPretty backgrounds\n\nThe bad:\n\nWhile the combat is fluid, it's not fluid enough. The dodge move NEEDS it's own button and dashing shouldn't be a double tap on an analog stick, it should be mashing the stick forward instead akin to Smash Bros. (though it might not be as frustrating on a keyboard or d-pad).\n\nEscape closes the game immediately, without providing a warning message.\n\nThe first boss is a massive difficulty spike. It needs slightly more telegraphing on it's spinning move, and a longer charge time for the laser.\n\nJust guard must be unlocked and bought.\n\nAn overabundance of ranged enemies makes the final are a ♥♥♥♥ing nightmare where a single hit can lock you in a 0 to death combo\n\nKnockback needs be removed or reduced\n\nAlso the 1.12 update breaks the game apparently.

Yay!!\nGreat music/sound that sets the mood. Game is pretty.\nCan play this on old laptops with X3100 graphics.\nGameplay has genuine depth and replay value is high.\n\nTHE BAD:\nShort story mode. (But replay value is high, so...)\nMaybe too hard. You need to be a veteran gamer for this one!\n\nTHE SPECIFICS:\nThe music is fantastic and really sets the mood. First thing I did before playing the game was listen through the whole menu track. Also, the menu is really pretty and the graphics will scale to your resolution which keeps things running fantastically well -- I cleared this game on a Dell Inspiron 1525 laptop and apart from a slow down here and there it ran really, really smoothly!\n\nThe difficulty curve goes from naught-to-ninety and then some, but levels out a bit when you learn what you're doing. The story is short, feelng more like a single chapter in length, but it's nice that it's there.\n\nThe combat is a bit on the hard side until you get to grips with defending and dodging, and even when you do get into the flow you still end up taking damage in seemingly unavoidable ways. The battles are tough for this reason, but after a while you realise that avoiding damage is sort of the name of the game and it becomes all the more fun – I wouldn't call it bullet-hell exactly (it's too chaotic for that) but the game can definitely throw a lot at you. Choosing which skills to use to take down a particular foe gives the game a genuine strategic side, and it's here that you'll find most of Fairy Bloom Freesia's depth. The difficulty can drive a player to rage-quit, but victory is always a different skill choice or better approach away.\n\nAt less than a tenner it's well worth it, but I stress that this game isn't for beginners! If you enjoy fighting games and games where you can restart with the same high-leveled character at a greater difficulty (Disgaea, Recettear, Diablo, etc), then I'd say this one is for you. If you only ever play through something once, then get it on special offer and you'll still have your money's worth.\n\nI just really hope Edelweiss takes the core concepts of this game and expand on it, as the potential is huge.","August 15, 2014","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The soundtrack is pleasant and enjoyable. The game, on a sale, is cheap as chips. All the keys are fully rebindable (on controller, anyway. Not sure to what extent they are rebindable on keyboard). The game's story also seems like it may have some interesting ideas.\n\nUnfortunately, that's about all I can recommend, as the game just isn't satisfying to play. The combat arenas, while pretty, are repetitive, small, and clausterphobic. The combat, while functional, feels very stiff and can be inconsistently responsive. Every single part (not just special attacks, mind you) of Freesia's moveset is locked off behind a leveling wall, which really doesn't help matters. I mean, progression is fair game, but not when that it compromises the core gameplay loop.\nThe enemies themselves fail to remedy the issue as well. While the basic enemies are nearly brain-dead and incredibly easy to dispatch, when facing a boss, if you intend to stay alive for any period of time, you best block every single of the attacks while you whittle down the incredibly long health bar.\n\nBored. I moved to pastures new.","November 3, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall its a classic beat the crap out of everything and feel awesome doing it game.","August 8, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It offers some challenging fights such as bosses, and the normal enemies aren't as easy as a normal game would have.","August 11, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's like that on the smaller levels. Story and music are ...there, maybe you'll enjoy it, but I couldn't get past the gameplay being so boring. This is not a platformer, this is not DMC, this is a beat 'em up in a tiny arena. Too repetitive. Too little there.\n\nFor regions outside Japan: you have to click "no" at the update popup, as the latest update (1.12) is only available for the Japanese version.","September 26, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Plays a bit like a 2D character action game. Lots of customization and moves woven into a very simple core combat system that feels liquid smooth. Relatively well-translated dialogue in a sparse and simple but intriguing plot.\n\nI'd recommend this for the price it's usually at. If it's on sale, you HAVE to pick it up.\n\nWarning: Normal mode is pretty tough! However, reiteration time is very slight and you keep Mana (used to upgrade skills/stats) you gained in-level even upon death, so it's challenging but very forgiving with a very "one more try!" feeling. But people who aren't into that kind of challenge shouldn't feel guilty about playing on Easy for their first playthrough!","January 8","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If I recall correctly, my total playtime was over 100 hours.\n\nThe visuals are a little simple, but with very satisfying animations and special effects. The music is also very good. I believe the soundtrack has remastered versions of the tracks, with clearer instruments. Freesia's voice may be a little annoying, but I think you can turn her volume down.\n\nThe gameplay is a combination of Super Smash Bros and fighting games, with customizable abilities and special attacks. There are many available options to suit all kinds of playstyles. If you're a fan of those games, you should definitely check this game out. It starts out a little slow, but has lots of depth.\n\nLast I checked, the English translation is a little wonky here and there (eg. achievement context seemed confusing, a few typos and so on), but it's not too bad. I think.","December 29, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's pretty much the same thing in both Story mode and Guardian mode, there are a few cool bosses, but enemies are the same and levels barely change.\nNo unlockable characters either, that's a real shame, especially for a made in nihon game.\nThe gameplay is pure dope from day 1 to day 99, if you enjoyed the demo, go for it.\n\n","May 19, 2013","true","66.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
