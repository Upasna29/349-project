"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phasersup/recommended/92600/","phasersup","veryx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phasersup/","485 products in account","This game "Xotic" (pronounced exotic), although I continually call it zotic for some unknown reason, is a splendid blend of bejeweled meets unreal tournament. The focus here is on scoring and making the most of the multiplyers within each of the many differing score attack levels there are in the game. Usually, there are 3 goals to complete to attain a perfect 5 star rating for your actions during gameplay. Those goals are: gathering all the essence, eliminating all the scabs, and finding all the brains. Essence is a colorful diamond type figure dotted around the levels and can be acquired by running through them. The scabs are red rooted circles in the ground that you must shoot consecutively to form chains which increase your point scoring potential. Finally, the brains are mysterious objects that float and explode once shot and resemble a fireworks effect that is usually fairly awe inspiring. There are also essence, brain, and scab attack modes that challenge the player to complete the level in the quickest time possible. The scoring system for all phases of the game is superb, as well as the leaderboard system. Although this is a challenging game, its a breakthru product as far as first person shooter scoring games go.","February 13, 2014","true","52.2"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","27","34","3","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grimwold/recommended/92600/","grimwold","Grimwold","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grimwold/","566 products in account","Gameplay\nThe game mostly plays like a traditional First Person Shooter, where the screen is your field of view, with a small proportion of it at the bottom taken up by your weapon (the symbiotic Macroterra bug), and an area at the top of the screen is your H.U.D.. You move around the maze with the usual combination of WASD (PC version) with additional actions using the Space and Tab keys... As is customary now, the game uses mouselook, and the mouse buttons fire your primary and secondary weapons... the scroll wheel is also used to change between different fire modes, and unusually, scrolling up changes the primary by looping through the available attacks, and scrolling down changes the secondary. For me, this took a little bit of getting used to, although I tended to stick with the same attacks.\n\nWhere xotic differs from other FPS games however, is the emphasis on scoring points, collecting multipliers, beating the clock and getting a High Score on each level... there are lots of ways to ramp up the points too, with bonuses for killing enemies while in mid-air... collecting Orb essence in mid-air... racking up long chains of scab plant kills.. etc. It also feels like a 3d platform game, as a lot of the time you will be jumping either between objects, or onto platforms that you create.\n\nAnother main difference is that enemies are a lot less frequent than in most FPS games, with maybe a dozen or so on each level, in varying combinations of moving humanoid enemies and static gun emplacements. There are also some nasty crawling insects that spawn from hard to spot dirt-heaps. Therefore the main focus of play is in shooting the scab plants, collecting the orb essence and killing the orb brains in the time, though all the enemies need to be killed in order to complete the level, and this can be done regardless of what proportion of the other goals you have completed.\n\nThe focus on collecting points over killing enemies makes the game feel a bit more casual for a First Person Shooter, however the time pressure and level design definitely doesn't make it an easy game.\n\nGraphics and Sound\nWhile not the best FPS game graphics I've seen, Xotic certainly has a very distinctive and rather lush graphical style that seems to fit the game rather well... there's also an interesting contrast between the background, which is a decaying technological world, and the bright colours of the plants that you release by shooting the scabs.\n\nThe Macroterra weapon is very cool looking, and has some neat animations when you are firing, jumping etc. It does lack the variety of having different weapons that you can change between, like in other FPS games, though the variety of attack types is not lacking, with a total of 8 different primary and secondary weapons.\n\nThe sound is well done, with some really nice sounds effects for shooting, scoring points, killing enemies etc. While the background music is good, without being either particularly memorable, or too intrusive... it fits in really well with the game and adds to the atmosphere without being distracting in any way.\n\nDuration and Replayability\nI completed the campaign mode in the base game, on easy difficultly, in about 5 hours, which may not sound like much, but is pretty good for the price. There are also 3 other game modes on each level, which are Scab Attack, Essence Attack and Brain Attack, where you concentrate on one type of goal.\n\nThere are 3 difficulty levels, which affects how much time you have to complete the level, and in addition to that, on each level you earn a star rating out of 5 for how well you performed, so if you are a completionist, then you can spend a lot more time trying to perfect each level. I have managed 5 stars on maybe 60%+ of the levels so far, on easy difficulty.\n\nI can see myself dipping into this game occasionally, given the nature of the levels and the slightly casual feel to the game, I see it as a good FPS game to 'relax' with.","January 16, 2015","true","11.9"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","18","23","3","1"

The game combines aspects of Shooting Galleries, Speed Running and Platforming. The usual issues of platforming in 3D/FPS are handled quite nicely by the "Hard Hologram Technology" that allows you to summon a platform right beneath your feet for a meager energy cost. Collect awesome powerups, fight interesting enemies and upgrade your weapons and abilities over multiple regions full of levels. The graphics and music round this out with a really vibrant and fun presentation, full of color and interesting art design. Also the developer support for the game has to be mentioned.

Most people who gave this game a bad review don`t understand it`s not about killing the enemy it`s about collecting as many points you can in the shortest amount of time. I like the different game modes especially the Essece Attack. I don`t like when it gets stuck in a few places and sometimes the AI don`t agro the player and also i wish the AI to be much aggressive in the hard level. I wish developers will introduce coop modes to the game and also a TD mode :D\nIn my opinion the game is brilliant: easy to learn but difficult to master :D (there are some hardcore players in the lederboards :P )\nPs.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/postgnome/recommended/92600/","postgnome","Gnome","http://steamcommunity.com/id/postgnome/","557 products in account","*Gnome Seal of Approval*\nAn unusual 1st person score attack game where each level is covered with three different kinds of objects you need to collect. Some by shooting them, others by moving over them. Finish the level quickly for more points. Long chains also boosts your score. The entire thing is spiced up with an unusual alien world setting and some very light combat.\n\nAgain, this is not a game for everyone being a straight up score attack game. I had a few hours of fun with it trying to complete each level with a 5 star rating. You need to find the most effective route and find all the hidden objects to get a perfect score.\n\nIt's not an advanced or especially challenging game. I'm guessing alot of people find it boring even.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AMPStudios/recommended/92600/","AMPStudios","AMP Studios","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AMPStudios/","45 products in account","Created by: WPXGAMES\n\nWhat is Xotic?\nXotic is a hybrid arcade-style FPS with vividly luminous graphics and addictive game play mechanics. Eliminate the Orb’s life-sucking presence as you blast enemies, and detonate chain-reactions in a race against the clock, all while discovering secrets, collecting power ups and upgrading your skills. Xotic is an indie throwback made for modern gamers in search of originality. Hone your reflexes and develop a combat strategy that will place you at the top of the global leader board. Are you up to the Xotic challenge?\n\n\nIntro Cinematic to the game Xotic, and first impressions: I really enjoyed the way WXP created the intro to this game, the cinematic. While not a lot of animation, it has a lot of beautiful graphics that help tell the story, along with the narration from the robotic voice. Right off the bat, the sound of the narrator was a bit odd, it felt as if it might not be understandable, but it was very clear in every word spoken.\nThe voice, rising and lowering in tone, sounding ever so strange to this brand new game, became familiar as the story unfolded about the story of the “Orb” that longed to have a physical body. I question, though, the very creation of the Orb, its origins, and its intelligence. It seems rather odd that the story starts off talking about how there is an Orb that is taking over the universe, planet by planet, but with no explanation as to how the Orb came to be, and why it possesses the capability to think and want.\n\n\nThe default controls start your sensitivity level at 50%, and it took some adjusting to find out, for me personally, that 90% was just right so that turning didn’t feel too slow, or too fast. As one hundred percent felt uncontrollable.\n\nPlaying through the first level, the tutorial, I felt the game really explained a lot regarding the point system, and an explanation of each item. I’m referring to the scab plants, the vase, power ups, and aerial collectibles. I, however, did not feel that the game explained well enough how to climb to greater heights to shoot, and collect, other items.\n\nAnother thing that the tutorial could have explained are the Champions that you face. I found out, the hard way, that Champions are like mini bosses in the game, that are tougher to kill, and do they more damage than regular enemies.\n\n\nPlaying through my first bonus round, I really got to feel a lot more of the controls and how they functioned, and a bit of the moving around while jumping. Overall, it’s really becoming pretty fun, though jumping and moving mid-air is a small feat in and of itself. It’s beneficial to get a good feel of where you want to jump, and what you wish to collect, so careful planning in some of your\nmaneuvers is a good idea!\n\n\nContinuing on through the next levels, the game picks up in difficulty, challenging the player to really use strategic shooting, dodging, and making use of their secondary weapons, if they have one. The Champions become tougher, and throwing in machine gun-like enemies makes it even more crucial to watch where you’re standing, and to take cover in order to regenerate health if needed!\n\nI’ve finally mastered the art of climbing higher into the air using a combination of jumping + Tab, to put the small nearly invisible shields below me, to creating platforms at just the right time for hitting those extra bonus points, and even dodging enemy attack!\n\nThe action in Xotic is very fast-paced, the music calming, even in a tough situation when things are difficult. I’m truly having a lot of fun, and enjoying using experience points to unlock new skills, increase my characters attributes, and kicking some serious ♥♥♥!\n\n\nOVERALL SCORE: 8/10\n\nSound: 8/10 The music and sound effects are really great in this game, but I don’t care too much for the narrator’s voice.\n\nControls: 9/10 Playing through the game, everything is relatively easy to control. Aiming is great once you have sensitivity set properly, but when it comes to mid-air control and direction, this is where things just don’t feel as smooth. It’s as if you’re trying to jump while in space, with no gravity or sense of control regarding your direction.\n\nGraphics: 8/10 The graphics in this game are beautiful, and make me feel as if the environments in the game are really alive. But this also creates a sense of confusion among all the objects your shooting. It’s hard to see the small mountains that release the bugs that explode on you, the machine gun enemies sometimes blend in with the surrounding environment, and the look of the enemies and your own character isn’t the best, but there’s nothing to really ruin the experience that I’ve had with the game.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nXotic is a really fun, fast paced, action RPG First Person Shooter, with beautiful graphics, lovely music, and an intuitive design on combat and collecting items while constantly improving score.\n\nThe game is definitely built for the competitive player who thrives to have the highest score.\nFor 9.99 on Steam, Xotic is worth buying and playing through the entire game!\nAbout WXP GamesWXP Games is a small independent team of dedicated developers located in Seattle, Washington. WXP is committed to creating unique new games outside the traditional developer/publisher model.","September 17, 2014","true","3.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The point of the game is to get the highest score possible by doing a few things, creating long chains which net you more points, finishing the level quickly, and completing the 3 goals that each level has in order to get a 5 star rating, which also nets you more points. All of these elements combined give you aspects of speed running, score attack, and even some platforming with the "Hologram's" that you can deploy mid air and land on.\n\n*The game has a very vibrant and neon color pallet, and while the texture quality isn't fantastic, it does still look fairly nice and should run on most systems.\n*It feature one weapon with multiple different modes that all fire different projectiles (All firing modes besides the default require energy to use, this regerates on its own)\n*Xotic has upgrades for each different weapon firing mode as well as upgrades for the character.\n*The game is single player, but a lot of fun of the game comes from trying to beat those on the leader boards, after each level it will show your place on the leader board for the level you just completed.\n*Xotic has quite a few levels that are interestingly designed and do vary a bit, the game can become repetitive, but i think thats mostly a genre related problem and not Xotic's fault. But the game is very fun in burst playing sessions (At least for me).\n\nThe game works great using a mouse and keyboard (As a FPS should), I did find that using a controller seems to have weird sensitvity issues, the Y axis is much more sensitive than the X axis, and they can not be adjusted individually, but this is not a problem for most as the keyboard and mouse work just fine.\n\nIf you're into score attack games, this is one to look at.

Graphics are pretty crap and constant view of just weapon is annoying. Cant recommend this game, ive played better free ones online.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pakkidis/recommended/92600/","Pakkidis","Pakkidis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pakkidis/","1250 products in account","Rating 7.5/10\n\nOverview\nFirst Person Arcade Shooter focus on highscore and time\n\nThe Good:\n\n+ The graphics are bright and colorful. I always like it when developers are not afraid to use color in their games. The graphics are not going to blow you away but for the type of game this is, I was surprised.\n\n+The game has a variety of different levels broken down into 4 game modes. The first game mode (campaign) is based on achieving a highscore,this is accomplished by killing enemies, collecting essences, destorying orbs, and killing plants and chaining them together. The higher the chain the bigger the points. The other three modes are time based. You either have to collect essences,destory orbs or kill plants within a certain time limit.\n\n+The games main focus is on replayability. If you are the type of person to replay levels to constantly get better and better and get higher and higher on the leaderboards, this is the game for you.\n\n+In addition to all of this, the game provides plenty of powerups, i.e double damage, flight, double points etc. to make things more interesting\n\n+ Different variety of guns to suit your playstyle, although I found only a handful of them useful.\n\n+Achievements are somewhat easy to get.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-The game does not save any of your controller bindings upon startup. You have to adjust it everytime you start the game. The default setting on the controller was good enough for me, however I found this to be pretty sloppy.\n\n-the shooting does not have the same weight and feel as other First person shooters. This is more of a minor gripe as the focus on the game isn't necessarily shooting enemies and is somewhat expected from an indie developer.\n\n- The game can feel repetitve at times, their isn't enough in the core gameplay mechanics that would keep the game very interesting for very long\n\n-if your not interested in getting highscores, or beating times you may find this game somewhat boring.\n\n-A.I is a bit wierd. Sometimes they do what their suppose to do and other times they just stand there.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis is a love/hate type game. I found it somewhat refreshing in the FPS genre focused on something different. I think the game deserves more attention and sales but just make sure you know what your getting yourself into.  If your expecting a fast paced game killing lots of enemies like the old days then you will be disappointed. This is more of an arcade based game that requires some thinking in how your approach the level in order to gain the most points possible. Enjoy.","September 18, 2014","true","14.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Levels are very short since most of them require to do them fast to get 5 stars. 7/10 Needs more types of game modes that doesn't have timer in it.","August 20, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's kind of wierd, but after playing a few  levels its wierdness is great.  A mix of search and destroy meets puzzle chains...or something like that. I like it.","February 2, 2012","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Get it on a sale.\n\nNot worth it's price yet.\n\nMajor downside? It takes too long to start because it is "loading the leaderboards", this should be fixed ASAP.","December 27, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
