The only problem I have is that no-one is ever online, when it came out there was a fair amount of people online but now there are hardly any! D: The concept of the game is brilliant and i great even for small children (though I am not of their number). The game is displayed in a type of 3D-ish GTA 1/2 style. Whilt there is only one gametype you can still have fun without completing the objective or playing as Omegalodon, instead you can have races across the fairly large map, aerial dogfights, trying to blow up every structure etc. I highly recommend that you play thi game, whilst it doesn't have many players now I believe there should a lot more people playing this wonderful game.\nI can never give a game a core of ten out of ten but shall give it a score of 8.5/10","October 5, 2013","true","3.6"," 45 of 50 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","45","50","0","0"

One city.\n\nThe pixelated destruction involved here has managed to make me tense and carefully maneuver my pixelguy around. Either from one team or another.\n\nOne team has a Ginormous Landshark Japanese Thingy that destroys most on its path. Other players on this team are armed with simple pistols and healing beams that activate automatically when "near" the GLJT. The other team on the other hand has military units that can pound rockets and even what seemed like a mother of all bombs slow targetting ordinance. Both sides die frequently and must respawn and race back towards the location of GLJT either to kill it or heal it. Usually GLJT will die or reach the objective and destroy it.\n\nCRAZY fun!

Now that that's out of the way, Omegalodon is a third person multiplayer-team based game set in a small open-world city. Omegalodon (the big monster dude) has to destroy the city along with the help of the Enviros (green team). The President isn't so happy, so the soldiers and police (red team) have to stop them.

Why? Well Debra, Simone, the Internet, let's get down to it.\n\nPros:\n- the gameplay. Simple, and so much fun. Either shoot stuff, smash stuff, or grab a Boeing and just plain fly like the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Delta Airlines ever employed.\n- the concept. Do you want to be a shark? Hell yes you do. Do you want to be a giant shark on steroids that can make glitter bombs that can seriously mess with every Boeing within a quarter mile? Hell yes you do. Do you want to be a little man who runs around and shoots that giant shark with a 9mm pistol?!? Probably not! But do it anyways.\n- the graphics. Lush, beautiful graphics like these need to be seen by all! What with all the... squares... and rectangles. Seriously, it's simple. So you can play it with pretty much anything. No, not you Celeron users.\n\nCons:\n- the devs. Literally no sound from them. Are they still working on this? Who knows. Do they even know how awesome this game is doing? Probably not. Are they still alive, or were they some of the people you shot in the airport in that Modern Warfare 2 scene? Yeah, it was like 28 seconds in. You shot them.\n- the world. I think custom maps could really help this game out. Walking down the same path every time gets kinda lame. Imagine a world where there are MORE TREES. Can you even do that? I hope so.\n- the shark. He's got limited attacks. Like more limited than Apple's range of devices in 2010. It's either smash RIGHT in front of you, or the glitter bomb which is all around you. I think a freakin' laser beam on his forehead would help significantly.\n\nSummary:\nBuy it. Play it. Get the devs back over here so that we see some new content. It's a good game and it deserves your money.","November 27, 2014","true","8.8"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","19","20","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/manixbak/recommended/248350/","manixbak","Bok M'tek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/manixbak/","418 products in account","This game is amazing and more people should play it! (Mostly because there aren't many players).\n\nBasically, this is a team based third-person shooter. There's the red team consisting of soldiers and the police who try to kill Omagalodon. There's also the green team with one person being a hug walking shark mutant thing (basically a shark version of Godzilla) and people who try to help him by healing him. If Omegalodon dies, then the red team wins. If Omegalodon reaches the destination, the green team wins. There is a variety of weapons and methods of transportation for the red team with tanks, laser-shooting jeep things, turrets, helicopters, jets, planes, huge planes, rocket launchers and quite a bit more. The green team can also use helicopters and such but their main focus is healing Omegalodon. However, Omegalodon is slow but he has a lot of health and three types of attacks: a light punch one, a heavier stomping one and a charged laser shooting energy field thing. That's pretty much the whole game.\n\nSo yeah, if you're still reading this, you should definitely buy this as you are interested enough to read this review.","November 19, 2014","true","0.4"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TurtleSquared/recommended/248350/","TurtleSquared","TurtleSquared","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TurtleSquared/","43 products in account","This game is a prime example of why a developer really needs to listen to his/her game's community.\nThe developer for Omegalodon, North Of Earth (NOE), gave up on this game. No updates, no bug fixes, no anything. We dont even know if he/she is still ALIVE. Also, due to the one gamemode, this game gets old very fast. There just isn't an incentive to play it. The servers don't fill out, half of those servers are being run on a pirated copy of the game so they aren't compatible with the steam version, and worst of all, is that there is no real ways to enhance teamwork or something to that sort.\n\nLike I stated before, there isn't an incentive to play it. For example, I have Omegalodon in my 'Favorites' category in my Steam Library. I see it, and once and a while go, "Well that is a candidate..." and then see something like Rocket League, or CS:GO and go "Well........those are a bit more varied and fun." It's all about the fact that 'North Of Earth just flat out gave up on this game.\n\nAnd that doesn't mean that this is a bad game! This game is incredible! If you have friends that own it and play it often, buy it! This is a great game to not only have, but to play when you really don't have time for other games. It launches pretty quickly, doesnt load much, has NAT PUNCHTHROUGH (That's geek talk for "you dont have to be a geek to host a server") and is pretty fun on the surface. However, If you don't have friends to play with, or the willpower/finances to make them play with you, I would suggest you look past it. Get it on sale, or something to that effect. I give the game a 8.9/10, and the developer's community interaction, a 2/10.","January 5","true","25.1"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

With one incredibly detailed map, dotted with multiple vehicles ( the space bomber/ fighter jet/thing being my favourite) and jokes, this game never ceases to be ridiculous. It's not without problems however. As I said there is only one map that is one mile squared in area, which isn't really enough for a MOBA. Movement is also very restricted as the Omegalodon which makes it hard to hit ground enemies before they run away.\nOverall, if your willing to overlook the small mapsize and you don't play as the Beast from the deep too often, you will have a whale of a time with this game.\n","November 25, 2013","true","0.5"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","22","28","0","0"

Its frustrating to kill anything since it has no real aiming mode. The environment that is destructible is just trees and some small stuff but nothing much to be excited about. The "OmegaLodon" is lame and can't fight back really well at all when being shot at. It doesn't feel like there is an objective when playing this game online. There is no description or story to the game at all. The community will probably die fast due to all the reasons I am mentioning. It doesn't have an Offline mode which is annoying and it would be nice to play with some bots to understand this game more and get a feel for what this game can offer. The graphics are retro which is charming but the overall feel of the game doesn't feel finished. It feels clunky and not really polished. I wouldn't recommend this game at its current state and I hope some patches have come out that fix the issues this game has.","February 24, 2015","true","4.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","1"

The soundtrack is great, the graphics are great, and the gameplay is a lot of fun, no matter which class you are.\n\nMy only gripes would be that the island is too hard to navigate via ground-based means (lots of long detours to get around water), and that helicopters and planes are just too hard to shoot down from the ground (or the air for that matter).\n\nHighly recommended.","September 20, 2013","true","13.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I decided to install and fire this up for a quick play around and was astounded to find anyone at all playing this game. Admittedly, it was only about 10 or so, but hey, that's more than I saw a few years back on this game!\n\nThe game is fun with friends, if a bit simple. The simple gist is one person plays as a giant reptile who needs to weave through a maze, destroying buildings to keep his health up, whilst the majority of players try to kill him using a wide assortment of vehicles and a few try to save him with their healing guns.\n\nUnfortunately, this is as far as the game goes, and the only real novelty you'll have on it after playing as the Omegadon and fighting the Omegalodon (and there is no fun in being a healer, honestly) is discovering the many different vehicles... Even though the majority of them are weaponless and so pretty much useless.\n\nPlaying as the Omegalodon is fun the first time, if dull. The rounds are long and it takes a lot to kill you, so for the most part you will just be following a set path, smashing some buildings and taking swipes at people in helicopters. Honestly, it gets a bit dull.\n\nPlaying as a soldier or policeman, you'll find yourself instantly dashing to the nearest armed vehicle and following the Omegalodon in relative safety, plinking away at its health. That's it.\n\nFor sake of completion, the Enviros, the players who try to keep Omegalodon alive, are armed with healing guns and can use vehicles to stop the military and police.\n\nDue to the third person view and very free control scheme, there's not much in the way of tactics, and more often than not the Omegalodon will win because the other players have more fun just killing each other since it's more of a challenge. As a sandbox game, Omegalodon excels, but for its purpose, not so much.\n\nDESPITE this seemingly slamming review, it is fun! I enjoy it! But I cannot believe that they're asking for £7 to buy it! It is a game you'll play maybe once, and I know newer games you can buy for less than this that will keep you entertained for longer. If it's on sale for say, £3.50, it might be worth getting it so you and a few friends can have a jaunt. But otherwise, this is too much money for a game with little content.","October 2, 2014","false","1.1"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

Back when this game was at it's peak of players there were 50+ Servers online at a time now it seems the game has really died off, I did enjoy my time playing this game but unfornutely it isn't worth a Recommend as it was extremely easy to kill the big Shark and win the game for the Police/Military. If you were playing as Omegaladon you'd need atleast 3 Enviros right up your trumpet just for you to survive, That and it takes 13+ Minutes to get to the Objective as the Shark. I feel i was robbed of the $10 i used to purchase the game as it just wasn't as enjoyable of most games like it.\n\n2/10","August 5, 2014","false","1.5"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","5","16","0","0"

I was intrigued by the unique game play and I definitely got my moneys worth.\n\nThe game offers a unique "tower defense" like experience where one faction is trying to help their giant shark monster to the center of the city while another faction works against them. It’s a neat and enjoyable experience, especially when you experience the wacky flight physics of the fighter jets...provided you can get a good game running.\n\nAt the time of writing this, the population playing this game is almost nonexistent. It's been like that for awhile and that's a real shame. There was an explosion of players back when the game was new and there seemed to have been a jump in popularity when Youtubers like Nerd Cubed show cased the game.\n\nOne problem I have with this game is that it's a couple years old now and it lacks any sort of major updates. It's a simple, one level game with a generous map, sure, but part of the reason I stopped playing is there wasn't much else to do in the game. And I fear that’s one major reason why most stopped playing as well.\n\nThe major drawback is there are balancing issues. Teams are not managed to be fair. Sure, sometimes you get into matches where no one wants to fight Omegalodon, they just want to run around and blow stuff up, do their own thing. However, when one finally does decide to play the game like it’s designed to, there’s no way to balance the teams out for a fair match.\n\nOften you’ll have one rambunctious newbie jump into the limelight and run around as Omegalodon with no supporting players to keep his health up. So he walks slowly down one track of the map until his life slowly drains to zero, allowing the slightest breeze to kill him. Once dead, it stops everyone else dead in their tracks and the round is reset. This can get rather annoying after the fiftieth reset and you just want to fly around in a jet for fun.\n\nSo overall, I would say it was a good game back when it was still new, but right now it’s mostly just a game gathering dust in my library. Occasionally I will jump into it and try to find a match, but often I’m not so lucky or don’t play it long.","September 25, 2015","true","36.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
